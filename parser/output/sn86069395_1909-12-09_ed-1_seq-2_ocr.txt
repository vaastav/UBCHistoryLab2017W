bind together this republic and the great republic Imme diately to the south between which there is so vast n network of material interestsI I am happy to say that nil but one of the cases which for so long sexed our relations with Venezuela Lhvo been settled within the past few months and that under the enlight I ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal On July 30 1009 the government of Panama agreed after considerable ne gotiation to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who wero brutally treated one of them having indeed been killed by the Pnnamnn pollee this year This government was obliged to In tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nlca ragna which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept 18 1000 Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the Interests in the American claim of Alsop Co against the government of Chile The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the cast and had prom ised this government to settle it Then had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions which failed through lack of jurisdiction Now happily as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations the gov ernments of the United States and of Chile actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store have agreed by a proto cot to yubuiit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII The Nicaraguan Trouble Since the Washington conventions of 1007 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con suiting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another and in turn by all of the five Central Amer Ivan republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions Near ly every complaint has been against the Xolaya government of Nicaragua which has kept Central America in constant tension or turmoil The re sponses made to the representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of its relation to the Washington conven tlons have been at nil times conserva tive and have avoided so far ns possi ble any semblance of Interference al though it is very apparent that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American interests in Central America give to the United States a special position in the zone of these republics nnd the Caribbean sea I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promQte pence and welfare among these re publics efforts which are fully lip lire fluted by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interest It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zclaya goverument Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself They were offi cers in the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued ninny weeks and was in control of about half of the republic and ns such ac cording to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations they were CJltUICO t Â° be dealt wth as prisoners I of war At life date when this message is IsI printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nicaraguan charge daffaires and Is intending to take such future steps ns may be found most consistent with its dignity its duty to American in terests and Its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization It may later bo necessary for me to bring this subject to time attention of the congress in a special message In tho Tap East In tho fur east this government pre serves unchanged Its policy of support ing the principle of equality of oppor tunity and scrupulous respect for the Integrity of time Chinese empire to which policy are pledged the interest tel powers of both east and west By the treaty of 1003 China has un dertaken tho abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the Customs tariff along with currency joform These reforms being a maul lent advantage to foreign commerce as well as to tho Interests of China this poverriineut is endeavoring to facili tate these measures and the needful Ac < iiicjiiicp of the treaty powers When It appeared that Chinese llkin revenue were to ho hypothecated to foroln bankers in connection with a tvmt railway project It was obvious that tho governments whom nationals held this loan wouM have a certain direct iiturmt in the question of the rnrrylny out by China of the reforms In c1tUthlI The ndmlnfatwtlon deem ed American participation to bo of great national Interest Happily when u t I it WItS as n mutter of broad policy ur cent that this opportunity should not be lost the Indispensable instrutncnta Uy presented Itself when n group of AincrleiiM bankers of International reputation nod great resourcea agreed at once to share In the loan upon pro c1sel such terms as this government should approve The Chief of those terms Was Unit America railway wn tcrlul should be upon ah exact equality with that of the other nationals Join ing in the loan in tho placing of or ders for this whole railroad system After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured In one of the ChineseJapanese con tentions of Sept 1 of this year there was n provision which caused Consid crablo public apprehension in that upon its faco it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and AntungMuk den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled After a thorough examination of the conven tions and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed tho conclusion that no such monop 6ly was intended or accomplished ihls government made inquiry of the imperial Chinese and Japanese gov irnmcuts and received from each offi cial assurance that the provision had nopurpose inconsistent with the poll cy of equality of opportunity to which tho signatories in common with the United States are pledged Gift traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial as usual The arrangement of 1008 for a coOperative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States nnd Japan which is terminable in 1012 is already receiving the study of both countriesThe The Department of State 1 earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of I I state and most especially the legisla tion suggested In the secretary of states letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines lu a manner to make it a thoroughly ef i ficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad Under a provision of the act of Aug 5 1000 I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government In collecting Information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug 5 1000 As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of the treasury department and as to matters of the needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with the department of commerce and labor in its relation to the domestic aspect of the subject of foreign commerce As a consequence of section 2 of the tariff act of Aug 5 1000 it becomes the duty of the secretary of state to con duct as diplomatic business ull the negotiations necessary to place him in a position to advise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to Government Expenditures and Rev enues Perhaps the most important ques tion prcsented to this administration Is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 80 1010 will exceed the estimated re ceipts by 34070020 If to this deficit are added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal amounting to 3S 000000 and 1000000 to be paid on the public debt the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will bo in creased to a total deficit of 7y070G20 This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal 1 approve this pro posal The Panama Canal The policy of paying for the con struction of the Panama canal not out of current revenue but by bond issue was adopted in the Spooncr rvt of 1002 and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the princi ple by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity who arc toI enjoy it and there is all the more rea son for this view because the actual i cost to date of the canal which is now half hone oiid which iii ue oiuiiiOLod Jun 1 1015 shows that tho cost of engineering and construction will be S207700000 instead of StW70Y200 as originally estimated In addition to engineering nnd c construction the oth I er expenses including sanitation and government and the nmouut paid for the properties tho franchise and the privilege of building the canal in crease the cost by 70435000 to atonal total of 376201000 The Increase in the cost of engineering and construe construction tion Is due to a substantial enlarge ment of time plan of construction by widening the canal 100 rt In the Cu lehra out and by increasing the di mensions of the locks to the under I estimate of the quantity of the work Io ho dono under the original plan and to an underestimate of the cost of la bor and materials both of which have greatly enhanced In price since the I original estimate was made EconomyI I In order to nvold a doficlt for tho jnsulng fiscal y om I dim tod the ncniln of department In tho prbparft Ion of their

IIILJ I the so rotary of the treasury that the estimates of tho expenses of thogov crunifiit for the fiscal year ending June no 1011that is for time ne t it nl yearare less by 35003000 j than the total of appropriations far tho current fiscal year and loss by 04000000 than the estimates for that year So far as the secretary of the treasury Is able to form n Judgment usI to future income there will bcno I deficit in the year ending June 30 1011 but n small surplus of 712000 1011f In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the gov ernment have been cut to the quick I For the purpose of securing Inf 1mnI tlon which may enable the executive and the legislative brunches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction I ot the cost of governmental adminis I tration the treasury department has Instituted an investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the United States The object of the investigation is to devise menus to in I crease the average efficiency of each I employee There is great room for im I provement toward this end not only by the reorganization of bureaus anfl I departments and In the avoidance of duplication but also in the tr orI of the individual employee t Under tho present system It constant ly happens that two employees receive tho same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important nUll exacting than that of the other IjuI perior ability Is not rewarded or en couraged enICOUlII Civil Pensions As the degree of efficiency In nil the departments is much lessened by the re tention of old employees who have out lived their energy and usefulness it is indispensable to any proper system of economy that provision be made so that their separation from the service shall be easy and inevitable it is im possible to make such provision unless there Is adopted a plan of civil pen sions We cannot in view of the ad vancing prices of l1lng hope to save money by a reduction in the standard of salaries paid Indeed if any change is made in that regard an increase rather than a decrease will be neces sary and the only means of economy will be in reducing the number of employees and in obtaining a greater average of efficiency from those re tained in the service Frauds In tho Collection of Customs I regret to refer to they fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the collection of the customs revenue at New York city in which a number of the subordinate employees in the weighing and other departments were directly concerned and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining company and others The frauds consisted in the paympnt of du ty on underweights of sugar The gov ernment has recovered from the Amer ican Sugar Refining company nil that It Is shown to have boon defrauded of The sum was received in full of the amount due which might have been recovered by civil action against the beneficiary of the fraud but them was an excess reservation In the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who wan found to be subject to the sameCriminal Criminal prosecutions arc now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers The treasury de partment and the department of Jus tice are exerting every effort to dis eover all the wrongdoers including the officers and employees of the compa nies who may have been privy to tho fraud It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by con gress at present pending the probing by the treasury department and the department of Justice as proposed might by giving immunity and other wise prove an embarrassment in se curing conviction of the guilty parties I Maximum and Minimum Clause In Tariff Act Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference In order that the maximum duty shall be charg ed against the Imports from a country It is necessary that the executive shall find on the part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the practice under them against tho trade of the United States but that the dis criminations found shall be undue thai is without good and fair reason No one is seeking a tariff war or a con dition in which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused arousedTariff Tariff Readjustment The new tariff law enables me to ap point n tariff board to assist me in con nection with the department of state In the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to I assist officers of the government In the administration of the entire law I be beI I Bore that tVo 11rr of tags b ird will be of prime utility and Importance whenever congress shall deem it wise Hgaln to readjust the customs duties If the facts secured by the tariff board ire of such a character as to show gon erally that tho rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive tinder tho principles of protection as described In tho platform of the suc cessful party at the late election 1 shall not hesitate to invite the atten tion of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated there on Nothing however halts business and interferes with the course of pros perity so much as the threatened revi sloe of the tariff and until the facts arC at hand after careful arid daUber ate Investigation upon which suoh ro rislon can properly be
