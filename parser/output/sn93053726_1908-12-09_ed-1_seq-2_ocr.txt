President Roosevelt must hava known his message, although long enough, was going to be a pretty tame affair, soon the eve of its pub lication the bitter attack on Editors Smith and Laffan was brought to light. The letter overtops the mes sage by a long ways, and it looks as though we have not heard the last of the letter yet. The demand that skins of animals i or hides as they are called, shall be j placed upon the free list has been so ! urgently pushed at recent tariff hear ings that there is hope that the tariff on them may at least be reduced. With free hides, shoe and leather manufacturers it is thought will con cede the abolition of duties on all leather products. It is not the far mer or the cattle king who benefits by a high tariff on hides. The beef trust alone is the beneficiary. The royal Chinese envoy, Hang Shao Yi sent to thauk the govern ment of the United States for its remission of the eleven million in demnity is now established in Wash ington in a residence separate and even remote from that of the Chinese embassy and it is said he will remain i until late in March The ways of the oriental are peculiar. It is an ; ticipated that there will lie much ! hospitality and elaborate exchange of j courtesy. The Chinese government i may well be grateful and recogniz- ant of the disinteredness and gener , ositv of this country.

More exnense and laitor were pnf into The recently appointed new Becre tnry of the nuvy has announced hif method for reforming the bureau system which naval crit'es hold re sponsible for the Ineffectiveness and clumsiness noted by them in the de bigning of warships and the defects alleged by them to exiHt in vessels ol very recent construction. The way in which the secretary is expecting to provide himself with boar:l equiva lent to a general staff or admiralty, says a Washington writer, is by a department order creatin,; .1 general board, of which the admlra: of the navy, the chief of the bureau of navi gation and the president ti" the naval war college by Hie appoi Uiueni cf "such other officers" as the secretary may designate. Secretary Newberry will no doubt appoint a board of the aggressive critics of t he bureau sys tem; also young and progressive offi cers of the line. It is proposed to bring the departmental bureaus into close relations with this board, by designating as members a suitable contingent of staff officers, including members of the construction hoard. The reorganization proposed, it io thought, will tend to the promotion of a unity of purpose that has been lacking in the administration of that branch of the service which has to do with building and equipping war ships. It is well known in naval cir cles that Senator Hale of Maine, who is the chairman of the committee on naval affairs in the senate, is an in surmountable obstacle to the im provement of the navy. He has been opposed to large ships and it is sig nificant that a large number of the small ships have been built at ship yards in his state, where owing to the shallowness of the water, only small ships can be launched. His in fluence is paramount in naval affairs and has been paralyzing to the navy and very expensive to the county.
