The note has not been laid before the President and It Is considered doubtful If he has been kept advised regarding the progress of Its prepar ation. While It Is predicted that the Mexican reply to the latest communication will be an unqualified compliance with the demands of the United Sta?v, there are who believe that Carrama Is forced to the wall by the events In both j Mexico and the United States, ana mat. In accordance with the political customs of the country, he may try to mane kiriinmalln diversion which will satisfy his countrymen that he Is not yielding! and yet will prevent acuon wim But such a task will be a difficult one, In the opinion of American officials, for with the expressed intention of the United States to allow no more discussion and with the demand for Jenkins's Imme diate release reiterated, it Is considered a task far too difficult for Mexican diplomacy. Vhllo the unconditional release of Jtnkins Is called for it does not mean that Mexico Is expected to send him back to the. United States, nor Is it thought that Mexico would undertake to do that, for the note expressly states that the United States Invites and desires the fullest Investigation into the circum stances of his kidnapping. Yet It Is not thought that Mexico would welcome the results of an unbiassed and elaborate Inquiry, showing, as Is considered cer tain, that the Mexican Government either Is unwilling or unable or both to protect civilians In the State of Puebla, Tho release of Jenkins and his com pulsory return to the United ,States would not be a compliance with he de mands of the note, but a long drawn out Investigation of tho kidnapping and pos sible trial of Jenkins on the perjury charge might give the Mexicans time to take care of public opinion In their own country disregarding the opinion here, which they seem to bo perfectly will ing to do. Text of Note to Mexico. The text of tho note as transmitted by the American Charge at Mexico city follows : I hove not failed to transmit to my Government the note of the Mexican Government dated November 25. 1919, with reference to the case of William O. Jenkins, American Con aular Agent at Puebla, and I am now In receipt of a reply from the Government of the United States, which I am instructed Immediately to transmit- to you. Tho Government of the United States declines to be drawn Into a Juridical discussion of Irrelevant mat ters or unimportant incidents brought forward In connection with this case. The Mexican Government cannot be misled, as It Intimates, by the cita tion by the United States of "no prlnclplo or precedent of International law and not even a reason" for Jen kins's release; for obviously no such citation Is necessary for the enlight enment of o Government of the pres ent day. The Mexican Government believes, and rightly so, that the American roquest for' Jenkins's re lease Is not based on "solely the strength of the country which makes it." tor It knows the request Is founded on the Justice of (he right of ', an American citizen and United Continued on Fifth rage

CHINESE ARRESTED IN TOKIO BOMB PLOT Attack on Foreign Office Traced to Legation Servants. By the Associated Prat. TOKIO, Nov. 28 (delayed). A sensa tion has been caused In diplomatic cir cles by the arrest of three Chinese ser vants, two of them attached to the Chl neso Legation, and one to the Russian Embassy, and also the Japanese gate keeper of' the Russian Embassy, charged with complicity In the attempt to blow up the Japanese Foreign Office with bombs on the occasion of the celebration of the Emperor's birthday. The Kokumin Shimbun says: "This was the outcome of a riot of Chinese students In Toklo, with the object of killing the Minister of State and other distinguished men to avenge the dis grace of China on account of the Shan tung question. It was originally In tended to enter the reception ball and hurl a bomb.

Tho story of the ar rest. Imprisonment and final release of Capt. Kalserwetter, commander of the German submarine which sank the Brit ish hospital ship Glenart Castle, dis closes a wide ditferenco of opinion be tween British Government departments as to what rights the allied Powora have to punish the perpetrators of wan ton warfare. The Government legal department held that England had no right to do tain Kalserwetter during the life of the armistice, while the Admiralty officials believed that they had the right to ar rest such offenders any time and hold them for trial after peace was declared. After the signing of the armistice Kalserwetter went to Spain, where ho obtained passports for his return to Germany. He made the mistake, how ever, of landing at Falmouth, where he expected to board a vessel for the Bal tic. Admiralty officers at Falmouth ar rested him and brought him secretly to the Tower of London. Friends of Kal serwetter appealed to the Government legal department, which found that England was not entitled to arrest him until peace had been declared. This decision has negatived much of the work the Admiralty has done in tracing the perpetrators of the more barbarous submarine warfare. In view of the great amount of secret work done on various cases of this kind the kal serwetter ruling came as a bombshell to Admiralty officers. $100,000,000 m BELGIAN TAX.

WON'T MENTION TBEATY President Will Deal Mostly With Domestic Matters, Says Hitchcock. Special Despatch to Tns Sex. Washington, Dec. 1. With attend ance at a low mark, but a strong dis position to get Immediately to business and to disregard formalities custom arily observed at such a time, the regular session of the Sixty-sixth Congress opened to-day. Thero ,was a little uncertainty whether on the formal roll call to de termine tho prcsenco of a quorum a majority of the Senato would answer to tho call. It turned out that Hfty-four Senators wero present, only Ave more than the number necessary for busi ness. In tho House z&o mcmDors oi tho total of 435 were in their places. The Senato required tho yeas and nays before tho passage of a motion for a formal adjournment pending notification to tho President that Congress was sitting and prepared to receive his message. It has always been presumed that no business would bo attempted at tho Initial ses sion beyond, that necessary to make record of the fact that tho leglslatlvo bodies wero organized and ready to hear from the President, hut to-day the House proceeded at once to work on the calendar, while tho Sen ate Indulged in a brief discussion of thoTroprlety of takingup immediately the business before it without waiting word from the "White House. The personal attendance at the White House of a Joint committee to notify the 'President was dispensed with in view of the President's Illness. Senators Lodes (Mass.) and Hitchcock (Neb.). for tho Senate, and Representatives Mondell (Wyo.), Good (Iowa), and Kltchln (N. C.) were named as the committee, but instead of going to the White House they sent a notification in writing conveyed by officials of the two houses. These did not see the Presv dent Tnmnlty Notifies President. Secretary Tumulty took the note, dls appeared Into the Cabinet room and re appeared In about a minute to say that tho President was pleased and would forward a reply In writing, which later appearod at the Capitol with the state nient that the President's message would be communicated to-morrow. "The Senate faces an enormous dpeket of business." declared Senator Thomas (Col.), "and wo must make every day count if we are to dispose or it. e protested against the adjournment and Insisted that In the circumstances there would be no' discourtesy to the President If the Senate went on with Its work. Senator Cummins explained that the thought of discourtesy to the President was the last thing In his mind; If such a construction would be possible he would not ask a continuation of the session. Senator Curtis (Kan.) hoped the Senate would go on with Its busi ness, and Senator Thomas pointed out that there was no necessity In view of the Senate being fully organized and having a calendar of business awaiting It to await the President's message. Senator Cummins said he was ready to go to business and would be pleased If the Senate would determine not to ad journ. Senate Votes to Adjourn. But Senator Lodge Insisted on his motion, pointing out that tho President Is III and that any suggestion of dis respect would bo regrettable. He In sisted on his motion and the roll call was demanded. It resulted In adjourn ment, thirteen Senators, however, voting against It, The fact that the President did not re ceive the notification committee, to gether with his failure to receive or make any appointment to receive, Sena tor Hitchcock, the Democratic leader, caused revival of reports regarding his state of health. Senator Hitchcock al lowed his colleagues to know that he load no appointment for an Interview with the President and no Idea when he would go to the White House. He said, however, that he was Informed that the message from the President would not deal with the German treaty, but merely with domestic matters. Tho treaty will be dealt with later In communications to the Senate. What will be tho Administration's policy regarding the treaty Is as uncer tain as ever. It Is expected the Presi dent will withdraw it and at his discre tion return It to the Senate with what ever recommendations he may deem fit ting. But whether he will suggest a basis of compromise presenting the pos sibility of a chance for ratification Is not known to leaders on either side of the chamber. There will be nothing doing In any case for several days In regard to either the treaty or the resolution declaring an end to the state of war.

WOOD IS FOUGHT BY POINDEXTER Senator Seeks to Avert Presi dential Choice by South Da kota Republicans. CALLS A RIVAL MEETING Charges Steam Boiler Tactics by Leaders in Behalf of Sol dier Candidate. BpeHat Despatch to Tat Sex. Pierre, S. D., Dec. J. In an effort to frustrate the plan of leaders of tho Stato organization to swing tho Re publican convention to-morrow to support of Major-Gen. Leonard Wood's candidacy for President Miles Poln dexter, ' United States Senator from Washington, arranged a public meet ing at a theatre to-day. Ho asserted that tho leaders who supported Gen. Wood's candidacy had used steam roller tactics that would prevent him from obtaining a fair hearing for his presentation of his own. candidacy at convention to-morrow. Senator Polndexter's attack was quickly met by the lenders of tho movement to cause tho South Dakota Republican organisation to declare Its preference for Gen Wood. "I am for Gen. Wood for two reasons," said Gov. Peter Norbeck. "First, I believe he Is the man. Second, I know the Repub lican' voters of South Dakota want him as their candidate." The attack and the responso to it were the high lights of a aay of turbulent activity in this little prairie city, which for the first time finds Itself as a politi cal storm centre that holds nationwide interest The day was marked by a t feeling of unrest among Republicans that was due largely to Senator Poln-1 dexters Injection of his vigorous per- sonallty Into the situation, me unrest. however, did not operate to raise a doubt but that Gen. Wood would win to-morrow. For a Wilson Third Term. There was little activity on the Demo cratic' side on the eve of the party con vention. President Wilson will be In dorsed for a third term, thus leaving the State organization to adjust Its future course to developments. The choices, of the conventions will go before the voters In a primary election next March with the Important Indorse ments and support of the respective State organizations. Candidates for Presidential nominations, who fail of In dorsement by the' conventions, may get their names before the primary voters by petitions. Senator Polndexter will continue his fight before the convention. The one element of doubt In the situation Is whether there may be a minority ticket selected. Polndexter is regarded as hav ing no chance, but there U'consldered to be a possibility that Frank CLowden, Governor of Illinois, may be chosen to head the minority ticket. The meeting arranged- by Senator Polndexter was attended by an audi ence that filled the theatre. He divided his time between attacking the Demo cratic Administration at Washington and tho State leaders, who he alleged have decreed tho convention's action In ad vance. The charges ho specified against the National Administration were based on the failure to deal decisively with propaganda and activities of Reds and the dilatory policy In dealing with tho emergency caused by the strike of the coal miners. The Dakotas are begin ning to be pinched by Inability to ob tain coal In the customary quantity for Drotectton against the winter winds that are sweeping across the plains, and the!

Special Despatch to Tns Sc.v. PrrrsDURO. Kan., Dec. 1. Volunteers of Kansas to-day began digging coal in the strip mines of tho Stato and to-morrow tho first carload, billed to a freezing town In the western part of the State by order of Gov. Henry J.

Tho volunteers are working under a strong military protection, with Col Perry M. Holslngton of tho Fourth Kansas Infantry In charge. Col Holslngton to-day ordered the Btrip mines In the northern arid southern dsltrlcts of Crawford county put under military control. In this section four mines wero In operation and be fore darkness forced a close of work for the day three more mines were ready for tho digging of coal on tho morrow. From all over the Stato have come the men who are determined that the mines must be operated. A train load of men under heavy military guard proceeded from Pittsburg to tho coal camps near by during tho afternoon and began operations. More miners will be-distributed to-morrow and at the same time tho mines at Scammon In Cherokee county will be opened. Operations were) dlAyd to-day by the wreck of a Santa Fe train near Hum boldt last night This train was car rying Gen. Charles I. Martin, Adjutant General of the State. The train was ex pected here early In the morning, but did not arrive until late In the afternoon.

The train also bore 250 workers, college men from the Univer sity of Kansas, the Kansas State Agri cultural College and Washburn College. Among the Kansas University workers were many members of Its football team, who volunteered for mining duty In re sponse to an appeal between the halves of the Missouri-Kansas football game at Lawrence Thursday. The train carried also 265 soldiers. Gen. Martin declared that the wreck was caused purposely, evidently by a radical or an I. W. W.

The Wichita American Lo glon men bore more than their share of notables. Thero was Kugeno Stanley, son of the lato Oovernor W. E. Stanley of tho State of Kansas. Stanley, up to two weeks ago, was a Lieutenant In the Regular Army and a member of Gen. Woods's staif. Ho was at the Gary steel strike and has seen service In other Internal disorders.

The Railroad Administration earned a profit of U. 000,000 on Its operation of the rail roads for October, according to prelim inary figures for the month made pub Uc by Director-General Hlnes to-day. , In addition to this profit tho roads had an Incomo of $9,000,000 not shown In the October figures because of un usual conditions, which gives the Gov ernment a net gain for the month of approximately f 11.000,000. A profit on operations is shown for August, Sep- ' tember and October, but the big defi cit plied up early in tho year cannot now be wiped out Tho net result Jor tho first ten months of the year Is an operating deficit of $269,768,158. This will prob ably bo considerably cut by gains In November and December. Results for October were substantially affected by several abnormal conditions, two of them operating to understate the revenues and two operating to make the expenses mors than normal. The reve nues are underestimated by about (9, 000,000: first, because beginning with the month of October per diem charges for the use of freight cars were rein stated, with the result that In October there wore approximately $6,000,000 In cluded In car per diem debits, while the corresponding car per diem credits which inure on this account to other railroads In Federal operation on account of Oc tober transportation will not nppear until November; and, second, because of largo amount of revenue, estimated to be not leas than 3. 000,000, from coal traffic transported In Octobor, doee not appear In that month because, on ac count of the Impending coal strike, such j coal traffic was held In transit In the last few days In October, and the reve nues shown on the waybills relating thereto were not taken in the revenues fot the month. hese two conditions affecting revenues Into consideration there would be a net operating Incomo for the month of October 1919 of about $86,000,000, but the results as shown by tho reports ,for the month are about 177,000,000. The operating expenses were abnor mally large first because of an eztraor diary shitting ot open top equipment In order to furnish the maximum num ber ot cars to be loaded with coal In the two weeks Immediately preceding the coal strike; and, second, because of exceptional expenditures for mainte nance of equipment growing out of the prevention of a normal amount of re pairs In August on account of the un authorized strikes of tho shopmen. It Is not practicable, however, to make a reliable estimate as to the effect of these two abnormal Increases In operat ing expenses, although they are believed to amount to several million dollars.
