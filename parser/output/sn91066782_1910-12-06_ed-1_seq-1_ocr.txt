WW J? DAI Li TIMES VOL. X1V-NO. BxM?I?E, VETtMONT. TUESDAY. DECEMBER G. PRICE, ONE CENT. DEFENDS THE PAYNE TARIFF Taft Says Criticism is Not Against Protective Principle IN MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Which Also Deals with Panama Canal, Postal Savings Bank, Parcels Post and Conservation Asks for Raise of Judicial Salaries. Washington, D. C, Dee. 6. President Taft's message to Congress was present ed to-day. The message equals the rec ords for the longest ever submitted. The record was that of one' of Roosevelt's, and it contained 40,000 words. President Taft's message has about the same num ber. It was in part as follows: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: ' During the past year the foreign rela tions of the United States have contin ued upon a basis of friendship nml good understanding. The year has been notable as witness ing the pacific settlement of two impor tant international controversies befort; the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond ence since the fisheries convention of 1818, has given an award which is satis factory to both parties. Peace Commission. Appreciating these enlightened tenden cies of modern times, the Congress at its last session passed a law providing for the appointment of a commission of five members "to be appointed by the presi dent of the United States to consider the expediency of utilizing existing inter national agencies for the purpose of lim iting the armaments of the nations ol the world by international agreement and of constituting the combined navies of -the world an international force for the preservation of universal peace and to consider and report upon any other means to diminish the expenditures of government for military purposes and to lessen the probabilities of war." The work of the international fisheries commission appointed in 1008, under the, treaty of April 11. 100S, between Great Britain and the United States, hue re sulted in the formulation and recom mendation of uniform regulation gov erning the fisheries of the boundary wa ters of Canada and the United States for the purpose of protecting and in creasing the supply of food fish in such waters. The Far East. The center of interest in far eastern affairs during the past year has agafn been China. It is gratifying to note that the nego tiations lor a loan to the Chinese govern ment for the construction of the trunk railway lines from Hankow southward to Canton and westward through t lie Yangtse valley, known as the Ilukuang loan, were concluded by the representa tives of the various financial groups in May last and the results approved by their respective governments. Tariff Negotiations. The new tariff law in section 2 re specting the maximum and minimum tariffs of the United States, which pro visions came into effect on April 1, 1910, imposed upon the president the responsi bility of determining prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the United States and its products in anjr country of the world with which we sustained commercial re lations. The policy of broader and closer trade relations with the dominion of Canada, which was initiated in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum provi sions of the tariff act of August, 1009, has proved mutually beneficial. It justi fies further efforts' for the readjustment of the commercial relations of the two countries, so that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contigu ous countries and be commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and indus try on both sides of tho boundary line. The Department of State. All tariff negotiations, so vital to our commerce, and industry, and the duty of jealously guarding the equitable and just treatment of our products, capital and industry abroad devolve upon the de partment of state. The efforts of that department to se. cure for citizens of the United States equal opportunities in the markets of the worhl and to expand American com merce have been most successful. The volume of business obtained in new fields of competition and upon new lines is al ready very great, and Congress is urged to continue to support the department of state in its endeavors for furthei trade expansion. An instrumentality indispensable to the unhampered anil natual development of American commerce is merchant ma rine. All maritime and commercial na tions recognize the importance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant marine. I alluded to this most important sub ject in my last annual message. It has often been before you. and 1 need not recapitulate the reason for its recom mendation. I'nlcss prompt action be taken, the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great com mercial nation unable to avail in inter national maritime business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial intercourse. For many reasons 1 cannot too strong Iv urge upon the Congress the passage of a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee the establishment and rapid development of n American merchant marine, the res toration of the American flag to its an cient place upon the sejts.

INTERPRETER MAY TELL OF HATtlE'S WORDS Announcement Caused Excitement at To day's Trial of LeBlanc Girl on the Charge of Murder, at Cam bridge, Mass. Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 6. Excitement prevailed at the opening of to-day's ses sion of the trial of Ilattie LeBlanc for the murder of Clarence Glover. It is reported that Miss Gallant, the inter preter who talked with Ilattie at the third degree trial in the police station the night she was arrested, will come from Nova Scotia and testify this after noon or to-morrow for the prosecution, telling what the girl said in French. Herbert Willey, who lent the police his auto the night of the Glover murder, testified that he aided in the first search for Ilattie. Superintendent MeCall, who went into the Waltham laundry, testified that he saw marks upon the floor. No witness has yet testified to seeing Hattie Lelilanc enter or leave the laun dry, where the shooting is said to have taken pluce, and three efforts by the dis trict attorney to introduce testimony that more closely connected the girl with the crime have been ruled out by the court. On the other hand, the defense, during the seven days of the trial, has turned the attention of the jury from the little Cape Breton girl to Mrs. Lillian M. Glover, the widow, and the district attorney has several times been obliged to protect her against the attacks of Melvin M. Johnson, leading counsel for the defense. Half a dozen witnesses testified yes terday to seeing Mrs. Glover in her own home about the time the shooting is said to have occurred in the laundry. Being cross questioned, Mr. MeCall described the finding of Hattie's pin and Judge Bond remarked that he thought three others testified to finding a pin and comb. After the surveyor testified as to the laundry dimensions, Seymour Glover was called. WOMAN BURNED FATALLY. Mrs. John G'lmore of East Cambridge, Mass., Aged 72. Boston, Dee. C.

().- As n result of the investigation of imports of luces and embroideries at New Orleans the treasury department yesterday demand ed from May & Ellis, a firm of import ers in that city, the payment of $10. 000 in back duties-which the government claims should have been paid upon em broideries during 1907-08. No criminal intent is charged, but the undervaluations were due to feat ures of the customs administration at New Orleans, which recently was se verely criticised by a grand jury there. The investigation followed that criti cism. It is believed by the department that many of the agreed valuations in laces and embroideries may be lower than ac tual value.

BABIES WERE RESCUED. In Fire at Clarcmont, N. II., Last Night Taken Out In Blankets. Clareniont, N. II., Dec. C The four tenement block, 24 Trcmont street, owned by M. Ganmond, was burned out last night. The fire broke out of an unoccupied tenement on the first floor. The tenants were John Fleury and wife and Mrs. Fleury's cousin, Alexan der Brouse; Nicholas Montecalvo, wife and two" young children, and the fam ily of Charles E. Mann, consisting of his wife and two young children and Mrs. Mann's aged mother, Mrs. D. F. Piper. The fire spread so rapidly that the tenants, must of whom were in bed, escaped scantily clad with the mercury nearly at zero. Two babies were tak en out in blankets. All the tenants lost clothing and household goods, and property not burned was damaged by water and smoke. The firemen went into a room at the top of the house and removed a burning bureau in which was 300 in money be longing to Mr. Henry. The Mann fam ily suffered the greatest hiss, and had no insurance. Mr. Mann is critically ill in a hospital at Tewksbury, Mass. The origin of the fire is not known. It was burning furiously when discov ered by three boys, C. L. Cann, John Hackett and E. Stone, who were return ing home front sliding and gave the alilrm. The hoys also aroused the ten ants and by so doing no doubt prevented the loss of life. The firemen were delayed in getting wa ter by a broken valve stem on the first hydrant topped, necessitating tho running of ho-e lines through another street. The loss is estimated at $2, 500 with an insurance on the building. The same tenement was partially burned out four years ago when it was owned bv J. A. llurd. RIDICULOUS STATEMENT. Says Auditor Anable About Salary of M. & W. R. R. R. President. F. S. Aimble of Boston, general au ditor of the Montpelier &. Wells River railroad, characterizes, in a letter to the Boston Globe to-day, the statement as ridiculous that Dliuiel R. Sort well, presi dent of the road, is getting $.50,000 a year salary. His letter is as follows: , '"In the fitst place, the statement that Daniel R. Sort well, president of the com pany, was a Harvard 1911 man and left college to accept the presidency of this road is incorrect, he having been gradu ated from Harvard in the class of 1907 and having been since he left college in the employ of Fstahrook X Co., bankers, until the death of his father last March, when be assumed the care of his father's estate as adminstrator and succeeded his father as president of the Montpelier & Wells River railroad. "The statement that this road pays its president a salary of $.50,000 a year'is ridiculous, and the legislator making such statement should have known that it was untrue, as the annual report made to the public service commission of Vermont for the year ending June 30, 1909, on file in the office of the commis sion at Montpelier, and from which the figures relative to surplus were evidently taken, shows that the total amount charged during that year for salaries and expends of general officers (in which the president's salary is required to be included) aggregated only $.5,.51 4.7,5. "As to the further statement made that this railroad pays $!0,WM) a rear in dividends, it actually paid no divi dends for a jteriod of 12 years from IS, to 1902, and in that period accumulated a surplus from which dividends of 5 per cent., or sMO.oOO per year, were paid during the years 1903 to 1908 inclusive, but during the years 1909 and 1910 divi dends of only 2'i per cent., or $20,000 per year, were paid, and-the net income of the company for the vear ending June 30, 1000, 'was only $ 1 9,300.27. or $WH.73 less than the 2'i per cent, divi dend paid. "The balance sheet of June 30, 1000, as shown in the report to the public service commission, does show a Imlunee of assets in excess of liabilities of .$210, 0H.5, but floes not show undivided earn ings, as stated, of $10,309, or any other amount: ami this same balance sheet shows that of this surplus of $210,98.5. ? 1 03.302 is represented by the excess of cash of road and equipment over its capital stock of ?S(X 1,0110, and that a further amount of f 19.474 is represented by stock of materials and supplies on band, the current available assets and current liabilities at June 30, 1000. be ing resectively $31,323 and $2H.33".I3, showing a net balance of current assets over liabilities of $2.08.5.87. "The Sortwell estate, which does not own the road, as stated, but does own 11 large majority of the stock of the company, would be very happy if the statements made as to the roiul being the richest in the world in proportion to its size and having a large available surplus were true, but the facts do not bear out any such statement, as is clear ly shown above. "Regarding the allegations made that the passenger tariff is high, we have only to say that we consider the rate a fair one and will endeavor to prove this con- tion it officially called on to do so.
