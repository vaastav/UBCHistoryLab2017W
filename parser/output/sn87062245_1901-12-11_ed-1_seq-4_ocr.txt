yWMil Wf ifnt 5 THE WASHINGTON TIMES FRANK A MUNSEY An Uilurntlonnl Cnpllal A man who will after scores of munificent gifts set aside ten millions of dollars for llie cause of education deserves more than a monument If Mr Andrew Carnegies plan is realired Washington will become more than ever an educational centre Hundreds of men and women whose short purses preclude a journey UiruugU the higher walks of scien tific research will be able to cultivate their abilities Mr Carnegie treas ury will provide the necchsarv fluids and doubtless Uncle Sam will do all in his pouer to open to the earliest investigator the dtpartments and iii ftitition in Washington where much is to be learned This is an era for great educa tional enterprises and it is gratifying that Mr Carnegie has determined to put the Capital of his country in the van His superb library was a step in that direction and his universitv moemcnt so called for want of better term is a longer stride It appears that the beneficent iron master lielievcs thnt the true regen eration of American mankind is to be accomplished by awakening the best inslincts of the people through the magic of education Knowledge is not only power but in many cases it is bahation air WiicIterM Criismlc If Mr Vvnclitcr the Maryland could have his way the cadets of West 1oint and Annapolis Pads and noe guards shin and head guards would be laid away And gloom would settle down on the bporting spirit of the institutions -where we arc making admirals and generals Mr Wachter is afraid that the ca dets will get hurt if they play foot hall To be consistent he must inirj duqc bills for the aholition of all inil ner of games and practices necessitat ing physical activity There is an ele ment of danger even in walking when iec is on the ground Kecks and limbs have been broken in gymna biums The misdirected golf ball has claimed its victims The baseball dia mond has had its casualties Mr Wachter is very much like a great many other jeople who do not understand football lie has made up his mind that it is the quintessence of brutality And yet if he will seek the statistics he will find that in propor tion to the great army of young men who play each season the number of injured is almost infinitesimal He will also discover that most of the bad accidents of the gridiron and they are accidents befall those who have Jtot been properly trained for a rig orous sport The football field is no place for an Invalid But for the virile muscu lar man the game is superb and a splendid training for it brings out the genius physical and the genius strategic of the player Mr Wachter fears that the game may injure the cadets incapacitating them for future careers in the field or on the Mr Wachter might find it interesting to enquire how many of the splendid leaders now in the service plavcd football either when they were at Annapolis or West Point or when they were students in one of Ihe great universities S iI Keform In Chicnco A superintendent of schools in Chi cago whose intellect Is evidently one of a highly superior order makes a vigorous attack upon the time-honored assertion that three from eleven leaves eight which he regards as both bad arithmetic and bad grammar In oiiler to have been able he sajs to take the three from the eleven you must have had a separate group of eleven from the vicinity of which jciu could remove the three In fact you imit have had fourteen in order to be able to take three from eleven This beautifully refined piece of logic reminds us of the old problem about a certain improved make of stove Jluy one of the new stoves we wvro told and save half the fuel but why not multiply by two buy two stoves and save all the fuel There is of course a xerfect technical ex planation of the falsity of this pre tended syllogism but if asked to ic fut it it is much easier and just as effect It to reply Try it and see Likewise when a quibbling pre oi ian finds fault with a universally ui epted form of Ihmight he is best Dowered by an appeal to the first piimipU H of common sense Give tlii llilcago reformer eleven apples like nvvny three and ask him what three from eleven leaves If he at tempts to elelrj that it is eight he de mtus the good old fashioned penalty of the birch the Micnr Wnr It in dhmppoiutiug to a certain ex tent to find that the problem of our relations with Cuba cannot be nettled ptirelt as a mailer of ulaloKinnusliiii mid public duty but when the matter M vitallt iiiTeetB great business Inter ests it is inevitable that these should make themselves heard The thirty million dollars in duties which free ltndo with Cuba would remit are n mere bagatelle in comparison with the tremendous amounts of capital understood to be ranged on the op positc iics of the question On one side it Is argued that Cuba is the natural headquarters of cane growing that by admitting her prod uct free of duty we shall have the best and cheapest ugar and that bv refusing to do so we shall probably consign the island to ruin On the other it is urged that it is belter to ruin the Cuban planters than to destroy the beet sugar indus try of IlicAVcbt and to impoverish the cane raisers of Louisiana Hawaii and Iorlo llieo who cannot meet Cubm competition without the aid of a tariff The decision will probably turn upon the political status of Cuba As a foreign Stnte Congress can scarcely help considering her interests as sec ondary to those of her home competi tors If she were willing to come under the American flag no outcry ot rival business interests could deprhe her of free access to the greatest market in the world Mr lSourlcc Cochran of Jfcw York declares that President Roosevelt could stop the South African war with one word spoken to the English Ambassador It would be interest ing to know just which word of all the thousands in the dictionary Mr Cockran thinks would have so desir able an effect It is stated that Mr W K Henleys opinion of Stcvenon was wrung out of him Possibly if he could be reached by some of the dead novel ists friends they would wring his neck There may be objections to segre gating all the anarchists of the world on some defenceless and helpless island but there wnuM wrininlr l would never again dally with the pig 1 J10 objecon to pacillg ncrr jiostnlui skin Gridiron challenges from laic j a feu of 1s on samj fnrawav Harvard and

could be kept in comfort and plenty with the distinct understanding that they should remain there Safety gates are supposed to be for the purpose of preventing the care less and the reckless from getting into danger They arc not needed for the cautious If safety gates cannot prevent accidents like that of yester day they are of little use There is a Four Hour Sleep Club in Chicago the members of which are pledged to sleep only four hours out of the twenty four It is not known whether they w ill count the cat nap3 they will take in theatres at church and at table when the system once gets
