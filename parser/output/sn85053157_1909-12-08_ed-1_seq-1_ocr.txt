The River Press. V Vol. XXX. Fort Benton, Montana, Wednesday, December 8, 1909. No. 7 PINCHOT ON CONSERVATION. -Chief of Forest Service Urges Need of New Legislation. Washington , Nov. 30.— Glfford Pinchot, chief of the United States forest service, has again thrown down the gauntlet to Secretary of the Inte rior Ballinger in regard to the con servation policy. He declares that congress will have to decide at its coming session wheth er the great coal fields of the country shall continue to remain in the hands of the people or be gobbled up by monopolies and whether great water power.sites shall be given away to bpedal interests or be controlled by the people. Mr. Pinchot makes known his views upon these two "chief sources of power of the present and future" in a letter to Dr. Lyman Abbott of New York in response to a series of questions asked by the latter. Referring to the development of watér power and coal fields, the gov ernment chief forester declares that in most oases the actual development of the former can be done by private interests acting under public control, but that "it is neither good sense nor good morals to let these valuable privileges pass from the public own ership for nothing and forever." In explaining what conservation means, Mr. Pinchot declares that it stands against the waste of natural resources that cannot be renewed, such as coal and iron; it stands for the perpetuation of the resources that can be renewed; and, most of all, it stands for an equal opportunity for every American citizen to get his fair share of benefit from these resources, both now and forever. Will Not Enlarge Tariff Board. Washington, N ov . 30.— There will be no enlargement of the membership of the tariff board nor any legislation looking to the creation of a tariff commission with broad powers if the National Association of Manufac turers and the National Council for Industrial Defense can control the matter. These two wings of the business men's organizations of the country got together in Washington thib week and decided to accept the present tariff board as a sufficient fulfillment of their demand for a tariff commission, for the present, and to rely on the promises made by President Taft that the tariff board would have its field of activity enlarged and be gradually developed into a board of great pow ers in handling tariff matters. New Rule For Bank Directors. Washington , Nov. 30.— All the 2,500 national banks in the United States which now hold board meetings at irregular and infrequent intervals must have monthly meetings of their directors, must appoint examining and discount committees and all loans and discounts of each bank must be approved by the directorate board at the monthly meeting, such approval to be recorded in permanent form.

London, Nov. 30. —The house of lords tonight, for the first time in 300 years, refused its formal assent to the budget, thereby making it illegal for the king's agents to collect taxes with which to carry on the government. The budget will now go before the country for approval or rejection, that is, the crown, through the minis* try, will dissolve the house of com mons and order a general election. Whether the present liberal house and ministry shall be sustained in insist ing on the budget will be the issue in the contest at the polls. Bellinger's Record Approved. Washington , Dec. 1. — Attorney General Wickersham has made an exhaustive report after a thorough investigation of the administration of Richard A. Ballinger, both as land commissioner and as secretary of the interior. The report, which is now in the hands of the president, completely exonerates Ballinger of any improper act, either in office or during the brief time he was a private citizen, after leaving the land office and before he returned to Washington as secretary of the interior. The president did not ask for the ivestigation and report. There is no reason to doubt that he has had abso lute confidence in Secretary Balliager from the very beginning of the contro versy, has come to be Known as the Ballinger- Pinchot difficulty.

BREAK STRIKE. Railroads Attempt To Resume Traffic With New Men. St. Faul , Dec. 2. —With the impor tation of strikebreakers from Chicago and other points and the pressing in to service of other employes of the roads, the railroads of the northwest that were affected by the strike of the Switchmen's Union of North America, which went into effect Tuesday even ing, began their first real work today in trying to restore normal traffic con ditions between here and the Pacific coaät. Local warehouses were open today and the roads accepted limited freight shipments to points in Dakota and Montana. Despite the efforts of the railroads there was no noticeable improvement in business conditions in the Twin Cities this morning. In Minneapolis all of the flour mills, with the excep tion of one of the smaller ones, were stopped and the cessation of this in dustry alone threw about 5,000 men out of employment. It is stated that the mill men will lose $75,000 a week in wages while the mills are closed and that the loss of business to the milling concerns will amount to $700,000 a day. At the head of the lakes, where the most important industries are chiefly dependent upon traffic conditions, a continuation for few more days of the present congestion will force 10,000 men out of employment.

PROFITS ON MEAT PRODUCTS Investigations By Federal Authorities Explain High Cost of Food. Washington , Dec. 2.— Secretary Wilson has just fijished a unique in vestigation made for the purpose of his annual report relating to the in crease of wholesale prices of beef when sold at retail. Through employes of the bureau of animal industry inqui ries were made in fifty cities—large, medium and small—in all parts of the country. A schedule was prepared to record the actual experience of retailers in buying and selling a carcass or half carcass of beef, and among the facts ascertained were the weight and whole Bale cost of a certain piece of beef, usually a half carcass. Then followed the weight and retail price of every cut for which a uniform price was charged by the retail dealer. Thus it became possible not only to compare high-priced and low-priced cuts, but also to compute accurately the total retail price per pound and consumers' cost of the beef piece for which the wholesale price per pound and cost of the entire piece bad been reported. For the fifty cities the total retail cost charged to consumers above the wholesale cost paid by the retailers is 38 per cent. The average retail price exceeded the average wholesale price 31.4 per cent in the north Atlantic states; by 38 per cent in the south Atlantic; by 38 per cent in the north central, and the highest increase was found in the south central states, 54 per cent. Investigating Sugar Frauds. New York , Dec. 1.—The fruitful opportunity for fraud in the bustle of the enormous business doue daily on the Williamsburg docks of the Ameri can Sugar Refining company was what the government sought to bring out today in the trial of the six former employes of the company charged with defrauding the government by under weights. David Fragner, a customs inspector and once an assistant government weigher, testified that at a busy time two trucks a minute passed over a single set of scales, or eight .o the minute on the four sets in use. Each truck weighed half a ton, and each half ton, the government will contend, was weighed 13 pounds short, by the secret manipulation of government employes, who, it is charged, were paid cash by the sugar company for the evasion of customs duties. If the game ran properly the government stood to lose its duties on 5,880 pounds of sugar every hour. President Completes Message. Washington , Dec. 3— Sixteen hun dred copies of President Taft's annual message were delivered at the white house at 9 o'clock this morning and were immediately turned over to press associations for distribution to daily newspapers in the country.

CAUGHT j^THEACT. Government Official Tells Story of Crooked Customs Work. New York , Dec. 3. —The storm cen ter of the sugar trial today focussed upon Richard Parr, special agent of the treasury department, who was foremost in discovering and exposing short-weight fr uds on the Williams burg docks of the American Sugar Refining company.

Does that go?" "Nothing goes with me," Parr tes tified he said. The wire, with which it was shown at a former trial the scales were ma nipulated, was produced in court again today and identified. The most sensational moment in the trial came when Parr detailed his dis covery of the steel wire which manip ulated the scales. He had observed Kehoe stooping over in a peculiar po sition, he said, and investigating, dis covered the steel spring. "After I came on the dock," contin ued Parr, "Spitzer met me, took me by the arm and said, "This thing must be fixed up." 1 said there was no fixing up to be done. Spitzer said we were all Masons and this would make trouble for every one around. I said I couldn't help that; they had made the trouble themselves." Busy Session of Congress.
