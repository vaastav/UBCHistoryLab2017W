CHRISTMAS ALL applications by children who wish to be guests at The Herald's Christmas dinner and entertain ment should be made this week. Santa Claus' steward, The Herald, and The Herald's committee, must know ap proximately the number of young peo ple who expect to share in the festivi ties. Application blanks may be ob tained at The Herald's branch depot, 3?.S South Hill street. We have no doubt there will be a large number of appli cations and our Christmas motto is "the more the children, the merrier the Christmas." Everything points to the certainty th;it The Herald's Christmas festivity will be the greatest success of its kind that has ever been recorded on the Pa cific coast. From small beginnings, it is attaining proportions which may well command public attention. This we attribute to two causes. The first is the open-hearted generosity of the people of Los Angeles, who never neg lect an opportunity of doing good and of making others happy. The second is the indisputable fact that there are many children in Los Angeles who are eagerly looking forward to The Herald festivity, because It will constitute practically all the "Christmas" they will be able to enjoy. Although this community during re cent years has been more prosperous than many others—we might say than a. majority of others—we have been told by Santa Claus he will appreciate our action if we dispense hospitality for him at a big love feast which will enable all the people who want to give Christmas cheer to their little neigh bors, to give It without stint, and ■will assure for many little neigh bors a really and truly Merry Christ mas, instead of one that will be only half-heartedly or make-believe merry. Cheerlessness at Christmas tide Is verily the abomination of desolation. The scriptural phrase seems to be ap plicable. We do not want that kind of a Christmas in Los Angeles. There Is no necessity for it in a place like this, where the proportion of wealthy peo ple or people of ample means Is proba bly greater with regard to the total population than In any other city in the United States. Christmas comes but once a year, and The Herald will see to it that to the children 'twill bring good cheer. We know our readers will continue to do their part, and that when we close the subscription books we will have a bumper-fund for the boys and girls of Los Angeles. City Auditor Mushet proposes to dock the salaries of councilman who, with out good excuse, fall to attend council meetings. It seems to us Mr. Mushet has right on his Bide. There is too much 'of a tendency in the United States, to discriminate between the re sponsibilities of public servants. who are ; appointed to salaried offices and those who are "only" elected by the people. -:-'x . Vo- 1 GAMBLING LOS ANGELES HERALD is the friend of clean sport of every description. It Is possible to have clean sport. Contests In skill and strength were indulged In long before anyone thought of setting up a gambling business. Gambling was begun when one ancient heathen said to another: "If Lycurgus doesn't knock the spots out of Alex ander at throwing the discus I'll buy you a flagon of Falernian wine. If he does, you'll buy one for me." The pro- fessional gambler, who cares little for the contest and would have no Interest in It If it did not provide him an op portunity of making a wag-er, la a mod ern parasite on dport. Gambling does not stop short at athletics. In order to provide a constant means of risking money on a wager and thereby prac ticing something which In Its relation to the laws of economy which govern business Is sheer anarchy, roulette and other games w«re Invented with out any intention of helping athletics or any other variety of sports. To call a gambler who gambles for the sake of the risk a "sport" Is a rank usur pation of a good old word. Such a man Is not a "sport." He Is anything but a "snort." Of course, it is not right to inveigh against one kind of gambling and per mit another. The great difficulty encountered in dealing with the gam bling evil is the disposition to pick out one particular form of gambling for punishment and let all the others go scot-free. Gambling is responsible for as much trouble and distress in the United States as the liquor traffic, and yet we seldom see any determined at tempt made by organized bodies of re formers to deal with it, and In churches, particularly those In which men engaged in certain lines of busi ness are pewholders, w« seldom or never hear a sermon on the subject. We wonder why this should be the case. JAPANESE QUESTION BY THE resolution of the Japanese government to forbid subjects of the mikado to emigrate to the United States a possible cnuse of fric tion between America and Japan has been removed. Japanese labor was dispiacingr white labor in many of the minor "lines." Japanese cooks and Japanese hotel attendants are to be found In most of the cities of the United States. They work for less money than Americans, therefore cer tain white employers, always and con sistently and invariably TRAITORS TO THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN THERE IS A DOLLAR TO BE MADE OR SAVED, are always willing to employ them. That is why they are employed. ' They do not Invade a busi ness conducted by white Americans and compel the white "bosses" at the point of the revolver to surrender posi tions to them. On the contrary, the white American bosses look for them, hunt them up, send out scouts to find them, and through employment agen cies and other business go-betweens and patrons, give them the positions which they refuse to give to white Americans. It is somewhat absurd to blame the Jnpanese for coming to the United States, when many high minded, pa triotic employers of labor are gasping to have them come, and are extending to them hospitable hands while the wife and children of the unemployed white man- starve In the back al'ey and perish in the slum. If our government will now supple ment the effort of the Japanese gov ernment to readjust conditions which have been brought about by a reduc tio ad absurdum of the system of cut throat competition, one step toward making America a country in which it is always possible for a white man to earn a living will have been taken. But, you ask, how can the government sup plement the effort of the Japanese gov ernment? By forbidding American capitalists and employers of labor to hire Japanese in competition with white men. That's how. ROOSEVELT BEFORE President Roosevelt settles down to be the associate editor of a New York publication he will go on a big-game hunting expedition to Africa. A formal announcement of his plans shows the object of the trip is not # merely "fun." On the contrary, President Roosevelt will head the most important scientific expedition that has ever been undertaken in Africa, while his exploration work may be the most important since Stanley's. It Is as odd as It is true that much of the British territory in Africa and much of the prestige Britain enjoys in the "Dark Continent" have been won for her by American explorers. Mr. Roosevelt's Scientific expedition will be outfitted by the Smithsonian Institu tion, will start from New York and will travel under the American flag. Part of Mr. Roosevelt's work will be conducted id British and part in Ger man territory. The natural history materials he will collect will be de posited by thetSmithsonian Institution In the new United States National museum at Washington. The results of his observations, however, will belong to the foreign governments whose ter ritory will be explored by him. Perhaps no more striking instance of President Roosevelt's unconventionally could be offered than his planned Afri can trip. It will have the effect of at tracting attention to the great con tinent which, in the opinion of many observers, is a huge English-speaking republic or federation of republics in process of formation. Interesting because It has an impor tant bearing on some of the possible consequences of the Roosevelt expedi tion is the statement that the journey from the Transvaal to Europe will be .shortened eight days by a new pro jected railway from Port Alexandra to the frontier of the German south west African protectorate.

ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 15, 1908. ' " ~"*'*T] ~# Mf.BLANK ( \* g^l^ JONES SAYS; TEACHERS' TOUR TWELVE school trachers will visit the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposi tion as the guests of Los Angeles Herald. They are being chosen by the votes of readers of The Herald. Details regarding voting conditions are printed on another page, along with the an nouncement of the contest, and the voting record down to date. Six of the fortunate school teachers will be se lected from Los Angeles county, three from the city and three from the coun ty at large, one from San Bernardino county, one from Orange county, one from Santa Barbara county, one from Riverside county, one from Kern coun ty and one from Ventura county. The Aluska-Yukon-Paeific exposition will be held at Seattle, Wash., from June 1 to October 18, 1909. It will be educational as well as entertaining, and by visiting the exposition the teachers will enjoy a health-giving out ing and at the same time acquire, at first hand, a great store of knowledge which will be useful to them in their work. School teachers conduct the most im portant of all our national Industrie". If we view it in merely a commercial way them is a very large amount of money Invested in it. The valuation of the Bchool houses, universities and edu cational buildings of the United States Is huge. Text books also represent a big sum. In spite of the financial strength of the educational industry of the United States, the actual workers, who keep the industry up to its high level of efficiency and productivity, are not well paid. The same might be said of work ers in many other occupations which represent big investments. But why any class in the community should have to suffer because its members are so busy working for the commu nity that they have no time to attend to their own financial Interests is some what puzzling. Perhaps there is an explanation in the fact that the work of Instruction has always been regard ed as being more or less philanthropl cal. Well, our readers will nominate twelve philanthropists who will make up The Herald's exposition party. The voting conditions are easy to fulfill, and we may suggest that with a little planning—say by forming cam paign clubs—the friends of teacher's may put their favorites at the head of the list. SHOCKED A YOUNG Englishman who i* visit ing Los Angeles is 'orrlfled be cause a young woman of this city slapped him on the shoulder. He think 3 such conduct Is not merely un ladylike, but superlatively frivolous and naughty. In all his born dies ho never had a young lady behave with such demonstrative familiarity. He haa traveled across an ocean and a continent to find In Dos Angeles "the limit." He Is buying reams of paper in order to write to his friends at home the thrilling story of his experience with a western girl. He had half expected he would find the ladies of Los Angeles In divided skirts and top boots, careering around the Plaza and up and down Main street on mustangs, but never in his wildest moments of anticipation had he expected that a lady of Log Angeles, "a real lidy, mind you," would give him a friendly slap on the shoulder. He says he came over here determined to woo and win an American bride and take her home in order that he might pay off the mortgage on Twickenham Towers and get the fam ily tree out of hock. But he changed his mind. When the American girl slapped him on the shoulder she almost dislocated It. When he Investigated the scene of the concussion he found it was black and blue. He doesn't want a bride who can almost knock him out when she slaps him in fun, because he can't help thinking of what might happen to him if she punched him in earnest. We congratulate the young Knglish- Stung ! Christmas comes but once a year, Pop says that there's "Christmas cheer." man on his prudence, caution nnd sa gacity. It la better to be poor all the dayi of one's life, Johnnie, than to marry an athletic American new wo man who shows as much familiarity with the twenty-four-foot prize ring as With ihe wedding ring. UNREASONABLE DELAY JMFORTANT and timely action, which will be Indorsed with grati tude by the community, was taken by the City club when by reso lution it congratulated Mr. Heney iiiifl Mr. Spreckels and expressed itself in favor of "such reform in our crim inal procedure that trials may not be bo protracted as to become a reproach to our system of jurisprudence, besides being an unreasonable expense to the etate." It was further resolved that Los An geles representatives in the legislature should be asked to do all in their power to bring about legislation to this end. The law's delays have for many years been proverbial, but within the last decade they have become unconscion uble, and have suggested the curious and catastrophial paradox that in the effort to administer law with a single eye to the interests of wealthy or powerful defendants public interests have been sacrificed. The law is intended for the protec tion of the public as well as of the In dividual, but under present conditions individuals of a peculiar type, backed by clever lawyers, may outwit the pub lic and cheat Justice, or may harass punitive and regulating forces of soci ety by such vexatious tricks, devices ajid "legitimate" subteVfuges that jus tice may have to travel a long and devious route before the criminal— whose guilt from the very first has been staring common sense in the face —Is at last tardily and reluctantly brought to book. It is a serious reflection on our civil ization that such conditions should ex ist, for a true and permanent civiliza tion can only rest on a firm foundation of sanity, and there cannot be sanity where there is not common sense. In a bulletin published by the bureau of labor the fact is brought out clearly that In the United States an immense amount of human life is wasted and a vast amount of unnecessary and pre ventable injury is done to health and strength, with resulting? physical Im pairment which has a very considerable economic value to the nation as a whole. Queen Wllhelmina's navy has cap tured a Venezuelan tub. 'Rah for Queen Willie, first in peace, first in war, first in the 'hearts of her coun trymen! Do they want to make her ridiculous in the eyes of the world? Apparently they do. Mayor Harper won't be happy until he wheedles a seven-passenger auto out of the city. Will ordinary tax payers be allowed to rifle in it upon request? Could the demand of a tax payer that he be allowed to use it be refused? Statistics collected in the great pities of the Union reveal the fact that in nearly all of them marriages among persons who are socially prominent are on the decline. Are we to infer that matrimony is no longer fashionable? Judge Wilbur says the majority age of girls should be fixed at twenty-one Instead of eighteen. This is reasonable. The assumption that a woman at eighteen is as wise as a man at twenty one is rather far-fetched. Ruef Is described as a man who with a turn of his hand upset the govern ment of San Francisco. It is a pity it was'upset so easily. At the approach of the festive season the bank accounts of family men begin to shudder. They are afraid they may shrink.

WHAT the metal-mining states feared would be the case is turn ing out just as was prophesied In the Mining congress. It will be re called that at the session at Joplin two yean ago an effort was made to keep the sessions of the congress in the west, but President Roosevelt took a hand and, through his Influence, the organization wan Induced to agree on a lon at Columbus, 0., says the Fresno Herald. The promise was given to those who opposed the move that the next session would certainly be called together in a western suite, but this agreement was absolutely disregarded and the present session In Pittsburg is the consequence. Metal mining, the original basis of the congress, has been shoved to one side or entirely Ignored, while coal mining has become the principal theme of the discussions and papers. Instead of advancing the interests of the gold and silver men they are scarcely con sidered, and an inquiring visitor from abroad In attendance at the session in Pittsburg might lie disposed to ask The Public Letter Box Ti> COItISESPONDENTS Lottery intended for publication must be accompanied by the name and address of the writer. The Herald give, the widest latitude to correspond ent.? but assume, no responsibility for their views. Letters must not exceed WO word.. 

BELIEVES PROPOSED CHARTER AMENDMENT ILL ADVISED LOS ANGELES, Dtc. 12.—[Editor Herald]: The charter revision commit tee has seen fit to offer an amendment changing the election of councilmen from wards to the "at large" system. Asa believer of fair play I protest. Under California laws if nine direc tors are to be chosen, a stockholder can vote for nine, or cast nine votes for one directors. Are we not shareholders in our city? If it works well with v private corporation why would it not work well with a public corporation? Again, if it is for the public good to have councilmen elected at large why not have the members of the state legislature elected at large? Exactly the same principles are involved. Wi'l JutlKe Works or some other friend of amendment No. 2 answer this? Let us go further and include congressmen. Why not? You might say that federal laws prevent. True, but are not the same principles again involved? Los Angeles is known as a progressive city; why should we change that reputation? If in the case of a derelict councilman we would have to call an election of the entire city to get rid of him, whereas undar the present law the decent voters of his ward can remove him without calling for a general election. The fact that the recall Is hanging over every ward councilman has a much stronger effect on him than it would were ho elected at large. To a student of pro gressive ideas amendment No. 2 is a poor proposition and should be de feated. M. L. 

CRAMER. ADVOCATES CARRYING "GUNS" AND SEARCHING MEN'S ROOMS LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.—[Editor Herald]: In your issue of the l"th lnst. I note what you say about the necessity of something .elng done to rid the city of the "winter birds of prey." It Is a timely suggestion, as every day and night some one Is either held up and robbed or some building Is entered and valuables stolen. It is an unfortunate fact that the city fathers do not allow peaceable and respectable citizens to carry the necessary means for self-protection, but hobos and hold uppers carry arms with perfect Im punity. It Is not safe for either men or women to be alone on some of our streets In our city. There is a remedy. Either allow every respectable citizen, man or woman, to carry a revolver for self-protection or let the proper offi cers visit every boarding- and lodging house in the city and every man who cannot glvo a satisfactory account of himself order him to leave the city or send him to the workhouse. By an ex amination of tho men and their rooms and belongings no doubt sufficient evi dence of their undesirable citizenship would be found in many cases. Koine thing should be done to rid our city of those thieving scoundrels. The Herald touched the keynote of the situation. G. M. TABER. POKES SLY FUN AT C. F.'S CONCEPTION OF CO-OPERATION LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12—[Editor Herald]: How ignorant one may be In a (more or less) enlightened age! But we live and learn —some of us— Bometlme3. Now, I have always supposed that to co-operate meant to—well —to co-ope rate. And I have heard those arch co operators—the Socialists —disclaim the oft-imputed intention' to "divide up." But C. F. has taught me two things. Firstly, that co-operation doesn't mean that the people should "co" their ''ope rations," 1. c., unite their labor; but that a few people who have contrived to get, out of the scramble, more than they needed to consume, should "pool the swag," or club their assets, for the further exploitation, in wage-slavery, of those who, having got less than they needed, have consequently no swag left to pool; "nothing to give," as C. F. puts it —only their "labor" to "sell." Secondly, (and despite the collectivists' repudiation of dividing up), I learn from C. F. that co-operation does In volve a dividing up, on the very word itself. One little clique (the capitalists) pro to do the "co"-ing, while the rest of the people do the "operating." Who says economics is a "dismal" science? Not as expounded by 0. F., anyway. To laugh? It is to explode. VAL STONE. SHOWS HOW AND WHY RACE SUICIDE IS ON INCREASE SAN JACINTO. Dec. 13.—[Edltoi Herald]: Your editorial of December 6 on luce suicide was timely. It is doubtful whether one person in ten realizes how rapidly our citizenry is degenerating. The soldier and the sailor naturally do not marry. Among railroad men, miners and linemen mar riage is rapidly going out of fashion. These are callings which require not only brave men, but men who must also be physically perfect. Volunteering for war takes the brave patriot to the front and kills him, while tho cowardly skulker stays at home to roo his family. A countless army of foreigners has driven Ameri can labor westward against the Chi nese (and Japanese) wall of California. Is it any wonder that tho laboring man regards raca suicide, not as a crime, but as a refusal to commit a crime? Native-born Americans arc not only going into Canada and Mexico by the hundreds of thousands, but are scat tering all over the world, leaving the "land of the free' in search of free dom! Our best immigrants are returning to Europe In droves and in return we get paupers and criminals. Statistics show divorce is Increasing three times as fast as population. We can see the writing on the wall, but what are we iroing lo do about it? A FARMER. whether he was dreaming or whether it was really a fact that the United States of America produced enormous quantities of the yellow and white metals annually. The dispatches that tell of the sec ond day's proceedings Bay: "The American Mining congress has appar ently concentrated its efforts on the improvement of the coal business." What must the miner of California think of that? Congressman Englebright, author of the bill for the establishment of a bureau of mining, hurried away from his home in order to present the facts with regard to the bill before this con gress in Pittsburg. What must be his disappointment to reach the Smoky City and to find that the congress is In the hands of men interested in coal properties, whose sole Idea Is to have a bureau formed that will look after their interests. Important as nre the coal mines of this country, It appears to us that the gold and silver men deserve and should receive more attention. 

NATURE'S IDEAL BALKED BY THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13.—[Editor Herald]: I am not so fond of contro versy as to wish to thrash a subject threadbare, but my contributions have been referred to so often that It may appear boorish to keep silent. I entered the arena actuated by only one conviction. It is unbearable to me to think of by far the most im portant half of the human race—the race renewers—being reduced to the condition of helplessness in which it today finds itself. Side by side with this is pity for the inadequacy of the remedies advocated. For my part I tried to show that the acquisition of the vote, or the enact ment of blue laws, cannot touch the question, since the trouble is that as a worker woman today either tlnds no place at all, or an insufferably hard and underpaid one. My object Is to make women look below the surfacu and become true radicals. Then the similar moral standard idea was urged as a remedy. I simply sail that the effects of what is tailed "mis conduct" are different with the male and female, and that accordingly so ciety has maintained separate codes. I stated a fact, neither approving nor condemning. I regard blame as a waste of breath. People are what they are and always do tho best they can. I hold with Nietzsche that the part of the animal world known as man must do as the rest of the animal world does —produce a higher type. This is the doctrine of the "superman." Viewed scientifically, taking f-cts as they are, nature works for this in two ways. Her Ideal man Is passionately devoted to women—he is of the virllo type. Her Ideal woman Is of the ex acting type, refusing to mate with tho inferior, and insisting that the man shall come up to the highest possible; standard. Present economic conditions render all this little better than a dream. Therefore those economic conditions are rapidly becoming impossible and must be changed. T. K. G. 

SAYS MATTHEW WROTE GOSPEL IN HEBREW, NOT IN GREEK LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12.—[Editor Herald]: "A Reader" from Hollywood in today's Letter Box is mistake^ when he says Matthews wrote in Greek. No, he wrote his gospel in Hebrew, and what he quotes is no doubt a transla tion into Greek. Jesus spoke Hebrew or Aramaic, a Hebrew dialect. He said: "Thou shall be called Cephas, a stone." Now whether in Hebrew Cephas means stono as well as rock I cannot say; probably it did, for the sense bears it out. Curious facts us to names may bo mentioned. The word Jesus is the same as Josiah, properly Yosiah, eavlor, instead of the Hebrew word Messiah, anointed. The Greek word christos having the same meaning-, was used, but why was the word messtah discarded? A most curious and amusing fact is shown how translations from one lan guage into another often pervert the sense of the original. This Is illus trated in the following: Michael An gelo, when about sculptorlng the statue of Moses, now in the Vatican, studied the Latin translation, where it says: "When Moses descended the mount his temples, brows, were horned." The Hebraic word is keren, which has two meanings, one is horn, the other, beams or rays (the English translation has rays of light). Angelo had given to him the word horns, and so he made the statue of Moses with horns. Now such Is the slavish sycophancy of Latin artists that whenever Moses is pictured there are the horns, an atrocious disfigurement; In fact a non sensical monstrosity. I commend the spirit in which "A Reader" discusses his subject for week ing truth. "Ask and ye shall receive." C. F. SEES SIGNS OF YIELDING IN PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE LOS ANGELES, Deo. 12.—[Editor Herald]: Like many others I have read carefully the president's message to congress and am free to admit in soma respects it is a most remarkable docu ment, in that it distinctly shows the Influence the demands of the people arcs exerting on the higher ups. Each suc cessive message from his nrst to his last contain recommendations more in nccord with Socialism. The president denounces this in scathing terms, yet in the next breath urges co-operation. He says we (remember the big we) stand aloof from the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant tools of popular prejudice and passion and urges the people to uphold the'dig nity of the courts, yet who in public or private life has ever seen fit to de nounce a judge or court in the land as he denounced Judge Grosscup. It is plain if President Roosevelt could cleanse his mind of the hatred he "ar bors for X V. Debs personally and the odium which he and his class attaches to the name Socialism, and he be per mitted to label Socialist principles and doctrines Rooseveltlsm, and by bo do ing induce the people to believe all re forms emanated from him, he would be on the Socialist bandwagon now. He sees the trend of public opinion in this, the seventh yoar of his reign, and now tries by hook and crook to steal So cialist Ideas, and would fain call them Roosevelt Republicanism, divert If pos sible the people's attention from the real issues that he and the class he represents may have the credit of be ing called the saviors of the nation. He has tarried too long. T J.
