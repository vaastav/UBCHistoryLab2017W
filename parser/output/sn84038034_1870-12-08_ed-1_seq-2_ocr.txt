FRANCE. Some very severe Halting has Leen done south cast of Paris, :::! the Prussians have met with several defeats, but ti.ey .tiu Lv iu cttv verv eilectually invested; and the f iege is likely to be continued until fbP iVcnch vltulate. Gambetta has annonnccd, by proclamation, that the armv of Paladincs has been compelled to ceasa its forward move ment. Genernl Mjinteuffe! has beer ordered from the north to re-inforce the German army in front of Paris The situation remains, practically, the same, and the following, which wc cMp from the Cincinnati Chroni r will give a more correct idea of the positions of the contending ar mies than wo could possibly do: The number of fortresses taken by the Germans during tuts war amounts Already to thirteen, t"i: Strasnourgh, Toul, Weis aenbenr, Lutzenberg, Vitrv, La. n. Schlets tndt, boissons. Sedan, Metz, Tnionville, Verdun and ISew Dreisach. Six other fortresses, including Paris, Belfort, liit che, ttiatebnrg. Montmedy and .Mezicro. are more or less invested. The principal stronghholds iu the north, the rednction of which has not yet oeen attempted, arc Arras. Konay. Lille and Dunkirk. The latter three places are, on the approach of tike enemy, to be put under water, or inundated a desperate mode of defense, no doubt, and equally efficacious. But considering the great potent fact that almost all the places now in the posses sion cf the Germans have fallen from want of bread and powder, the different methods of defense now attempted can prove but little use. Ia fact the famons systems of fortifications on the north eastern frontier, callrd into existence in the days of Louis XIV., and which was so long vaunted is a masterpiece of stra tegy, has to prove in lias war a dire calamity for France. Should tlie present concerted moye r ent of the Germans toward Loire suc- eed, there is po doabt but they will di rect their attention to Boorges. the principal r)ice d arme or arseual left to France." We might fill our columns with war despatches, and war news; and what one column would say the next would nnsay.

Y. World. A man in New York hag at Inst discovered a method of making iron Eafes that are safe. It is a valuable discovery; for tlie profession of bur glary has come to that degree of perfection that gentlemen who adopt It sigh that their business is (retting tame and that they have 'no cases now-a-day worthy-df their metal. But this New York 'merchant must have failed the most astute of them. He is a lumber deader In the lower part of the city, and keeps' lite snfe in a retired office far barjk in the rear of the lumber yard, far from police men and lamppost just in the handi est possible place for a burglar to ope rate. For about three months back he bas found the safe broken open once a week, regularly as washing lay. His ingenuity thus awakened 4nto flaming activity, he conceived the following device, which has worked like a charm since its adop tion: Going to a painter's shop, he ordered a sign to be painted on a small tin box which he had fastened conspicuously cn the top of the safe : "This tin 'box contains the key to this safe. If any gentleman desires to examine the contents of the safe I request thai he lock it up after satis fying his curiosity, as I wish to se cure my books against tire." Tbis device has kept the safe perfectlj burglar proof, and ihfis : saved its owner a large bill for repairs. Mer chants dcsii iug to adopt his inven tion will do well to anticipate his taking out a patent right. Ctiicoo Pott.
