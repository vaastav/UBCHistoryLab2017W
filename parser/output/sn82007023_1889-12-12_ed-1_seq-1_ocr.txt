Thr lincninont is quito lengthy, nlmut 12.01)11 words, lind iinid.i nlmut four and a half columns in this aft,'muon's Telegram. It is an able dtipnin.'nl, woithy of tin* president, dealing in a clear and concise manner with evi ry important movement and subject attracting the attention and thought of the American people. The message says lliat the United Stales is at pence with all other nations, and expresses a hope and belief that this state will continue indefinitely. It re commends a icsirietion of tariff duties and a thorough revision of the adminis trative features of the tariff laws, paying: "the inequalities of the laws should he adjusted, hut tlie protective principle should he maintained and fairly applied to the products of our farms, as well as those of our simps." «Saying further: "We cannot limit tho effect of duties on commodities brough here, by fixing our eyes on tlie public treasury alone. They have a direct relation to homo protection —to wotk and to wages—as well as to the independence of the people and of our country, and I believe that a wise patriotic legislator should rniargo the field uf ills vision to include all these." The message urges the removal of tax on tobacco, ns not being necessary to protect cither purchaser or mannfaeturer. Alluding to tlie silver question, the president says: "I have always been an advocate of tlie silver in our currency,' and gives a moderate endorsement of Secretary of the Treasury. The message urges large appropriations for the erection ami completion of coast defenses, ana approves the recommanda lion of the secretary ot war, providing for the encampment of bodies of national guards on coast defensive works, for the purpose of training our citizen soldiery in tlie use of heavy guns. It urges the improvement of rivers and bathers by largo appropriations, and referring to the recent killing of ex Judge Terry, in California, while making an attack on Justice Fields, and urges leg isltttion for the protection of United States Judges. The message expresses a belief in the necessity of amending the naturalization laws, so ns to permit inquiry into tho character of the applicant for citizenship and advises the enactment of a national bankruptcy law, and the immediate in crease of the navy. The message ndvocatcs tho establish ment of intermediate appellate courts, a better form of government for tho torri tory ot A'aska, and also that the general land laws should he administered liberally for the. benefit of settlers. An urgent recommendation is made for the passage of a dependent pension bill for soldiers of the rebellion, incapnc itated from earning a living from any cause, stating "that the nutinn must not leave them to he treated as paupers." It advices legislation for the protection of the lives and limbs of rnilroad em ployees, nod advocates transferring the signal service corps from tho war depart: ment, and putting it under the direction of the department of agriculture. States that in the opinion of the presi dent tho civil service law should not he repealed, but urges that a reform ia needed and should be attempted in its administration. The messago strongly urge« that grants of money be made to states in aid of the education of the negro. The president also earnestly invokes the attention of congress to the imme diate necessity of tho passage of auch measures as will securo to our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and all other civil rights. Claims that under the constitution congress has tha powor to pass laws establishing methods for the election of congressman. Tho message also urges ths granting of subsidies to ocean steamship lines. P. B. J. nur is It ho in e Washington, Dec. 3. —Fred. Dubois, delegate from Idaho, is not pleased to think that no mention is mado in the president's message of the propoeed ad mission ot the territories of Idaho and Wyoming. He claims that the author ities of Idaho, whose duty it was to pre pare a certified oopy of the constitution and forward tho same to the president have neglected to do so, and for that reason he could not get to the president and urge the mention of Idaho's state hood desires in the message. ia a to PEN 

SKETCH OP A LEWISTON MOSöBACK. A tnnssliaek is the sleeping partner in nur business relations with the Pacific Northwest. Fur all practical purposes lie is n native. Yes, he is peculiar to our climate, and would he anywhere outside of a grave yard. \\ i list or says: "Moss is an acrogonous erytogamous plant of cellular structure with leaves and a distinct root." In our mosshack the root is not distinct. It is imbedded in his spinal column, but ho has nil the other symptoms. The word tuossback as a term of re proach has as much earnestness or nppli cation as a porous plaster. When a man becomes a mosshack lie in of no use except to count one in the e nstts. He still breathes, but his func tions have lost all hope, all ambition and all nerve. In waiting for things to turn up, the mosshack displays ns much interest ns a seven year old note. Yet if a thin turns down when he expects it to turn up, he don't seem to t are. Th' mosshack tnhrs everything easy, including the market price, malaria, election returns, chills, cod liver oil and (lod's name in vain. Tin likes to talk politics, and when he does he is generally down on corporations and the head ot a nail keg. He is very reminiscent, and will go hack eight miles to look for a lost linch pi", when it is only a half mile to the next blacksmith shop. He never leads anything unless it it that portion of his life not yet called in lie joins the precession nt the tail end long alter the hand has turned the'bend in the road, and ho loses the step Ho takes no interest in the human rnco, but hangs around the judge's stand and waits to see the others come in. He never b«»8 because he can't ''.Turd to lose and don't know enough to win. lie has been introduced on snvernl occasions, hut lo-vcr j.*ot on speaking terms with enterprise. When the mail came by stage, he e.i-ked one of his neighbors every day to inquire fer him; now that it comes by rail, he makes tho request only once a week, lie don't believe in railrnajts. He buys improved farm machinery because he nan get it on credit. He leaves it. nut in the elements because he hasn't paid for it. He remembers that a rich mnn can no more enter the kingdom ot Heaven than a camel can vault through the eye of n needle. Thereforn, he remains poor and thin and will not hump himself because that's what ailed the comf1. Ho thinks there's money in pork, but continues to pay 14 cents a pound for bacon done up in a yellow ochre shroud He believes in economy and it makes hint almost mad to realize that hens lay most when eggs are cheap. Ho takes no newspaper because he thinks the editior will advise him to con tribute to the advancement of the country n which he is permitted to live. The mnssback stays around until he accidently meets death, or until some ailment that no one else will have any thing to do with, gets interested and absorbed in him. Then he goes off and we hear no more about him. five of say ia to Washington, Dec. 2. — Représenta tives Carter, liansbrough and Wilson to day cast their first votes as members ol tho national congress. They voted with regularity und ease on the republican aide of all questions that were presented and Ilashrough was once caught waiving his hands to tho republicans to get up, as il he was marshaling some hosts in a North Dakota convention. Delegate Dubois who labored 90 hard to sectrro the nom ination of Rov. Ramsdell as chaplain in the republican caueas, saw his friend turned down by the fact that a few republicans bolted the eancar, and a few others dodged votitg on the proposition, and a b'ind minister, who prayed for the democrats at tho last session, will offioiate in tho repnblioan house. Pan Francisco, Deo. 2.--An Examiner special from Washington aaya President Harrison has decided to ap point Alfred Russell, of Detroit, as the successor of Stanly Matthews on the supreme bench of the United Staten. Ministeriel Friend (on • visit)—I wonder what makes yonr mamma so happy to-day? She is singing around all over the house. Little Neil—I guess she'a thought of somfio' to scold about when be oomes home. A 

SECOND LEADVILLB. Mr II. W. Iligtey has about seventy five poun Ij^if galena and gray earbonato ores at the Ksuiond. The specimens aro very handsome and are being ndmired laily hv many mining men. They nro from the new "Lady cl the Lake" mino of the Okanngon country, which is fivo miles from the celebrated "Arlington." "How dues the ore assay, Mr. Iligley? was a«ked. 'Oh, about $100." ho replied. "I say that because l am a practical miner nnd want to give figures that practical men will feel like trusting. Picked sam p'es have gone as high as $2000, nnd a mill test of 200 pounds showed $140; hut $100 is, I think, a very fair average. "We do not have to go down at all, hut right in from tho shore of tho lake. In this way we can lap tho vein at a depth of 400 to 500 feet without ex pensive machinery. The ledge ia from sixteen to twenty feet wide, clear and solid, and lios between sonite and schist. The location of the mino is particularly favorable on account of tho capabilities which it ofTors for tunneling. A tunnel ia now about seventy five feet in, and ex poses large quantities of magnificent ore. We are also cross cutting at this point with good results: Tho ore is freo from base nnd is largely impregnated with gray carbonates, which give it its wonderful value. "I have been .surprised to ôeo," con tinued Mr. Iligley, "since my arrival hero, how extensively Portland capital is interested in tho mines of that country. "Yes, they all have rich ore and plenty of it, if they only get it out. We will hnve a seernd Leadville np there first thing we know. This mine is near a !o lot of other rieh claims in Which Portlanders are interested,"-Oregonton. ol his il in Union, Or.. Dee. 3.—The subsidy de manded by (î. W. Hunt, manager of tho Oregon & Wnshincton Territory road, to extend tho line through the Grand Rondo valley from Walla Walla to Union, has been fully raised. The sub sidy, which amounts to $1C,00 ! Y w s raised last summer, but owing to dohw i t securing it. tho timo for completin'' of the road hjd to he extended, nee an ting renewal of all subscriptions foriii.'rly made. The committee for the sccon! time has secured the full amount through the energetic efforts of P. E. Easton, L. B. Rhinehart, 8. A. Parse!, A. J. Hacket t and others of the general com mittee. Last week Manager Hnnt wss notified that the Grand Ronde had ful filled its part of tho contract and waited on him. Manager Hnnt telegraphed Irojn New York to-day to Assistant Manager Her man at Walla Walla to send an engi neering party immediately to make final location of the load in the valley. Amis t int Manager Herman telegraphed the committee to the same effect, and engi neers will be in the field this week. Twenty miles of grade are to be comple ted by next August, and the road is to be finished to Union on or before Decenr« bn 1, 1891. The people of . Union subscribed over onehalf of the full amount of the subsidy. The towns of Elgin, Cuvé and Summerville making up the balanoe. The commencement of active operations on the part of Hurt will cause the O. R. & N. Co. to build a branch to Elgin and also change its lino so as to oome direct to Ui ion, in place of going through tho tule swamp. With both roads and its natural advantages, Union will develop iuto the most important town in Eastern Oregon.— Oregonian. Monday morning, Indian Agent Leo Moorehouse left Pendleton for Washing ton, D. C., accompao'o I by Chiefs Homley, Peo, Showcwsy and Young Chief, Interpreter John McBeao and In dian Wolf from PalSuae. The chiefs go to interview the "powers that be" ro - 1 garding the allotment of the reservation lands, and Indian Wolf has a little private business of his own. He runs many thousand bead of stock up in the PalMae - country, tad there is a question regard ing his taxation that ha wants aettlod. At Washington the party will interview the*Iudian oommiaioner, the aaa r n t a r y of the interior, and possibly the présidant and it is expected that at least a month will elapse before they return.— Union. Walla Walla, Dec. 4.—JL corps of engineers left to-day to locate the Unci* road from here to Union, Oregon. The , work will he pushed rapidly.
