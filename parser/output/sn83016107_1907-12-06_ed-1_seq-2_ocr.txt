The address delivered in this town last Friday night by Hr. McCor mack, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, deserved a crowded house ol thought ful listeners. It may seem too altruistic to be credible that the National Medical Association whose members make their living by treating the sick, should be engaged in a campaign of education to show the public how to keep well, but it is one of the many healthy signs that man’s humanity for man is ever broadening and that this is one ot its noblest fruits. Discussing from our consideration all other phases of the question, we cannot financially afford to get sick if it is possible to keep w T ell (a) be cause we can’t afford the expenses of being healed, and (b) because we can’t afford to become for an indefi nite time mere consumers instead of producers. To use the words of the Doctor, “The drain upon the ma terial resources of the people of this county every year from preventable sickness and deaths and from vicious living is almost beyond the concep tion of the finite mind. In actual dollars and cents it is estimated to amount to more than the taxes paid for all purposes.” The case comes squarely before us then whether the state can afford to allow this continuous drain on her financial resources, to say nothing of the mise v. suffering and woe at tendant upon sickness and death. She refuses a “walkover” to the criminal class, and at great cost maintains a department of justice; she aims to check illiteracy and ignorance, de manding in stead an intelligent electo rate, and so at great expense builds up a public school system for the education of her rising generation. And yet her watchful care and police protection for the genera! health of her people is limited to one health officer for the county at the nominal salary of one hundred and fifty lollars per annum. We are strong- Jv inclined to accept the proposition of Dr. McCormack that it would be as reasonable that our judge on the bench should be engaged in the practice of law as for the county health officer to be engaged in the practice of medicine while filling that office. The work which should fall to his lot, both from his abundance and its delicate nature, precludes the possi bility of piivarepracticeanditsfaith ful performance at the same time. If then it is reasonably true that the health, comfort and convenience of all citizens could be materially im proved; that the sick could be more intelligently treated; that the tr ain of distressing burdens which follow in the wake of sickness and death could be greatly lightened; and that the productive capacity of our people could be thereby vastly increased the advisability of broadening the oppor tunies, the duties and consequently the pay of a county health officer admits of no debate. Our present representatives in the legislature are particularly equipped to take up the question and give the county the fruits of their best efforts. "IN GOD WE 

TRUST.” Probably no action of president Roosevelt has caused more comment than his recent order abolishing from the face of the new ten dollar gold piece the above motto. With the sourage of ids convictions and his characteristic style of expression, the president has taken up the the ques tion and given at length his reasons for this action. From th standpoint of law, for some years past the motto has been placed on our coins with no other authority than that of precedent. It was first authorized by Congress in 1864- and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury when it was stamped upon the new two cent piece then issued. Later it was omitted from the Revised Statutes, but has been retained by custom. In discussing its omission the president says among other things, 'My own feeling in the matter is due to my very firm conviction that to put such a motto on coins, or to use it in any kindred manner, not only does no good, but does positive harm and is in effect irreverence, which comes dangerously close to sacrilege. A beautiful and solemn sentence such as the one in question should be treated and uttered only with that fine reverence which necessarily im plies a certain exaltation of spirit.” Such a line of argument, if ad vanced when the proposed inscrip tion was first considered, would have been worthy of careful consid eration; and doubtless many irrever end remarks due to its existence would have been avoided during the campaigns of 1896 and 1900 if it had ■— aaplMl ——.— c never been stamped upon our coins. But it is one thing to plant and another thing to uproot. So deeply j is the Christian religion implanted in the bosoms of the American people that any blow to a symbol which typifies it is looked upon as a blow at religion itself. We even hear the clergy in some cases assert that “the religious sen tinent of the American people has been effaced.” Of course this is not and could not be true, but the feel ing is genuine and there is no com pensating advantage for having aroused it, therefore it was unjusti fiable and unfortunate. And is not this one of the many illustrations which our strenuous President is daily furnishing that while possessed with abundance of sense he falls lar short in that stock of saving common sense which counts for so much in every day life? Does not the president in emulating the virile, rugged courage (often braggadocio) of the rough rider tend to foster an esprit du corps more in keeping with primitive civilization than with the best accepted standard of manhood for the twentieth cen tury? THE 

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Congress having convened on Monday in regular session, the Presi dent’s message was duly transmitted to and read in each branch on Tues day. With a deep dip of his pen the President produced a document which, measured by the yard is re plete with greatness. With the fullest measure of confi dence in his previous utterances he still more loudly calls for govern ment control of railroads and other great corporations, and is fully ready to take in the small ones too on the basis that of doing business beyond a state limit they are subject to Federal control. On this subject how ever he finds many strong minds doubting the legal force of his propo sition. On the currency question, which is the all absorbing question of the day, in the vain effort to stem the tide of what is generally called the “Roosevelt panic” he goes no further than to recommend in general terms provision for expansion of the cur rency in times of stringency under such a restrictive tax as would prompt its retirement as soon as the emergency shall have passed. The general platitude in all of its indefi niteness sounds salutary, and we trust that a Moses may arise in Con gress who will give us something more tangible than a dream to grasp; just at present something very real and practical is sadly needed. On the subject of the tariff be stands pat till after the presidential election except on the subject of admitting free woodpulp for the manufacture of paper. This concession, if granted should be enough to make every suf fering publisher worship at his shrine, as at present the paper trust is hold ing them by the throat and smiting on hip and thigh. Like many of his previous utter ances he has shown his democracy in spots by appropriating some of their cardinal principles, such as an in come tax, arbitration of labor dis putes, stricter Federal control oi trusts and railroads with a necessary enlargement of the powers of the In terstate Commerce Commission, checking government by injunction, and a comprehensive system of im proved inland waterways. His recommendations on the latter subject, on the preservation of forests, and on land drainage are some of the topics on which all good citizens will probably unite in endorsing. It would seem to the casual observer that the message could have profita bly stood a severe boiling down without doing it an injury as a literary production or as a state paper.
