The Heme Insurance Company Withdraws from the Railway Insurance Combination. Neyt York, Doc 10. The fact that the Home Insurance Company had canceled its entire amount of insurance risks daring the week has caused a great 6cnsation and much indignation among the companies in the railroad insurance combination. The combination includes the Homo and Green wich insurance companies, of this city; London, Liverpool and Globe; Phcenix, of London; Koyal, of Liverpool, and Amer ican, of Philadelphia. These companies have heretofore rewritten policies for ono another, so that in case of loss the harden would not fall on any one company. Each company was under contract to take a cer tain percentage of the risks written by any of the other companies. In this way they have controlled an enormous amount of in surance Tho L'onie Insnrance Company has not only canceled the policies written on its own account but also the rewritten risks of the other companies. A leadingdenartmeut manager of one of tho companies included in the combination said to-day: "The throwing ud of the rewritten insurance of the Home company is a serious blow to trie other companies and will lead to unfortu nate complications. The fact is. the com pauies bve been carrying this on at a serious loss for some time, and the result will bo that the rates on all tailroad scheduler will have to be considerably in creased. The action of the Home company in canceling its own policies we have no ;uarrel with, but we object to its canceling such policies as it has rewritten." "Is it not a fact that the other companies in the combination have wiuked at this inovo on the part of the Home, in order to force the milroads into the payment of a higher rateT" was asked. "By nomeaus." was the reply. "On tho contrary, tbero is a hard and bitter feeling against it for leaving us in the lurch." "lias a conference been called to tako action on the matter?'' "Not that I know of, although it is prob able that there will be. While the contract permits any company to withdraw or cancel its policies, it is an unusual proceeding, and will result in future trouble. Th amount of insurance placed, with those re written, amounts to over Sl.CW.tl'O. The objects insured include wverythini; capable of being destroyed by tire, suih as rolling stock, trestles, briJgcs and depot.'' Mill May He Promoted to the Hennte. Gai.vkstox. Tex., Dec. 10.

This morning, imme diately after Judge Kising convened court in tho Graves trial, tho prosecution put Dr. J. A. Sewell, of tho Denver University, on the stand. Tho Doctor performed the anal ysis of the viscera in the famous Millington trial. He had also made an analysis of the bottlo .of liquid presented him by Dr. Holmes and Mr. "Worrell, jr., some of which, it is alleged, caused tho death of Mrs. Josephine Barnaby. He found this liquid contained per cent, of arsenic, arsenito of potassium, and 21 per cent of alcohol, and, judging from tho analysis, the bottle contained 1H2 grains of arsenic and no whisky at all. He stated that, ufter con cluding his examination, ho delivered the bottle to detective McPhariand, of the Pinkcrton asency. He exhibited to tho jury the result of his analysis, and also the results ofaa preliminary test in a glass tube. On cross-examination, in reply to Judge Macon's questions, the Doctor said he had made the analysis by the Marsh test, and he first looked for mercury or some corrosivo substance, but instead of getting mercury ho got copper and arsenic. Here the Doctor described the way an analysis for poison is made. The defense then attempted to havo the witness admit that the Marsh test was unreliable, but ho could not do so. Ho admitted that he had told the result of his work to Mr. Worrell soon after he had concluded it. Upon re-direct examination. Dr. Sewell said that antimony could readily be taken for arsenic, but not if tho two drucs were seen together. Then antimony was not readily dissolved, while arsenic was. In tho porcelain dish bearing tho stain of arsenic he tested the stain and proved that it was arsenic. If ho used Marsh's test without any other test bo would bo euro of tho result of this test, but ho did use other tests to ascertain the result of the Marsh test. Dr. Scwall was excused and Prof. Walter S. Haines, who also ligured in the Milling ten caso, was called to the stand. He said ho was ft professor of c.Neinestry in tho Kush Medical College, Chicago, and had been in that profession sixteen years. Be sides, ho was consulting physician to tho Chicago health department. He stated that ho was frequently called upon to ex amine bo. lies ami. fond, for poisou. . He had examined nine bodies for poi son and over a hundred specimens of food. In June last detective McPhariand gavo him a fluid for analysis. He identified the fatal bottle as tho bottle from which the fluid was poured. He made analysis by four tests, among them the Marsh, and his results were the samo as Dr. Sewclis. Judge Macon objected to the witness being allowed to testify to the analysis, for the reason that at the time it was mad o Dr. Graves had been indicted and was under arrest and ought to have been represented at the analysis, which was not done. The matter was argued un til 2 o'clock, when JudgoKiMug overruled tho objection and an exception was taken. Professor Headon, who mado an exami nation of the viscera and other organs of the dead woman, testified to the finding of arsenic in sutlicieut quantities to cause death. At the closo of the direct examina tion court adjourned until to-morrow. Y01XG MILLER'S STORY. Charges Ills Father with Violating a Promise How He Robbed the Stsjre. San Francisco, Dec. 10. Harry Miller, the young son of Joaquin Miller, tho poet, who was arrested on the chargo of holding up a mail stage, has been brought here, and in an interview in which ho told tho story of his life he claimed that hunger had driven him to the crime. Ho6aid that up to tho age of ten years ho Jived with his mother, Minnie Myrtle, in Portland. Con tinuing, he said: "She gave mo into the keeping of my aunt at Goose Bay, X, D., and went East after my sister, who was be ing educated in a convent. A year after she left they told mo she was dead. The next seven years of my life was passed on my aunt's farm. I attended a little country school at Gooso Bsy, but the taste ot education there only sharpened my appetite for more. I wrote to my father nt Oakland, telling him of my desire. He sent for mo to work on bis ranch. I was sutistied to do this because I thought with the money he promised mo for my labor I could educato myself in the hither branches. When ho declined to pay anger and disappointment overcame me and I left him. 1 traveled about the State doing odd jobs, working in San Francisco as messenger for the telegraph compmy. I drifted back to Oregon, and, hungry and desporate, I joined a stranger in breaking into a house, but we wto caught and sent to the penitentiary. 1 escaped, and. as suming the nanm of Joscpti McKay, re sumed my wanderings. "One da', tramping through Mendocing county in search of work, 1 came upon a house which had been left unguarded. I was famished, and ate my til!, then stole a gun and cartridges and some other articles and went on. Next day 1 suddenly cnnio upon the stage coach toiling up the bill. The idea of robbing it came to me as an in spiration, and I stepped behind a tree and ordered the driven to stop. Had he shown tight I should probably have ran away, be cause I was frightened and shaking like a leaf. When the stage disappeared I opened the treasure-box which tho driver had threw mo and found a pair of baby shoes, a couple of money vay-bills, but not a cent of money. Sherid' Standley arrested me at Santa linsa, and I shall plead guilty and sntier the penalty. I bear my father no ill will, end all I ask i that ho keeps away from me. If it had not been for my broth er's letter my identity would never have been known, and 1 would have gone to prison as Joseph McKay." Miller was held this afternoon by United States Commissioner Sawyer in $10,0X) bail, on tho charge of attempting to rob the United States mails. Stole $15,000 Worth or Jewelry. Sr. Louix, Mo.. Dec. 10. James Weekly and Joseph McNevins were ai rested this afternoon for a tiiteeu-thousami-doliur rob bery committed at the Union Depot on tho 16th of November. On that day a drummer for A. Peabody & Co., wholesale jewelers of New York, arrived iu the rity and left his sample trunk at the Union Depot. That evening his trunk, which contained $15,000 worth of diamonds and jewelry, was stolen. Tne robbery was traced to Weekly and McNevins through articlej which they had sold and pawned around tho city.

Will Tie Made Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for Fleeting Criap. Special to the IstliauapoUs Journal. Washington. Dec. 10. It may be set down as certain that Mr. Springer, of Illi nois; will bo chairman of the ways and means committee in the IIouso of Repre sentatives. This is not a matter of specu lation, but an absolute certainty. Farther more, tho arrangement for this was con cluded last Sunday night, before the speakership battle had reached its culmi nating point, and when tho Springer ranks were wavering in their allegiance. A gen tleman woil known to Chicago appreciated tho fact that Crisp was far in the lead and could not be headed. Ho saw, too, that it would be well to 6ettle the direction of Mr. Springer's vots when tho inevitable break from the Springer standard camo. Accordingly a conference was held, in which the course to bo pursued wasfully outlined. It cannot bo said that a "deal'' was made by which Springer was to turn over his strength in consideration of certain committee prefer ences, but it was settled that when it be came evident that Mr. Springer could not possibly bo elected his vote would go to Crisp. That a nnmber of his followers would also go to Crisp 'was naturally to be expected when he lod the way. There is no ambiguity among the friends of Mr. Crisp as to Mr. Springer's position on the committee. They kuow that it is already settled that ho. is to be chairman of the committee on ways and means, and the an nouncement of the fact io merely a question of form. When Mr. Springer .was seen by a re porter to-day he said his policy with refer ence to tho tariff was to provide for free wool, free salt, free lumber, free cotton ties, free coal and free binding-twine. Continuing, he eaid: "I do not think wo should attempt a general revision of tho taritl" at this time. Wo should oiler the couutry relief by passing hills for putting articles named on tho free list and tending them to the Senate. A general taritl' bill cannot be enacted into law and would keep Congress hero until October. I think theref should be appointed a strong committee on manufactures, with able in vestigators on it. It should consist of fifteen members ten Democrats and live Republicans. This would make five sub committees of three each. They should divide the work, ono investigating textile industries, another iron production, an other glassware and pottery, and so on. This committee vonKj ,e sort of adjunct to the ways and means committee, which could go on with its work, and then subso qneutly get all tho testimony without a long list of hearings. These sub-committees could go on during tho session and also during the recess. Their inquiries should not be conducted with a spirit of hostility toward the manufacturers, but with a view to ascertain the bottom facts aud ascer tain in each case what, if any. degree of protection is needed, as 1 have a suspicion that frequently it is represented that they need a great deal more protection than is really the case. It should be ascertained what is the labor cost on things produced, tho wages paid, whether the work bo steady or not. the profits of actual capital and not on 'watered' stock, the rel ative cost of production here and abroad, whether there are tacit or direct agree ments to limit production, and much more information of a practical character. This information is not now to be bad. The Democratic party could then light the Mc Kinley bill, ami if we win in tho elections this infoimation would enable us to form a tanll bill adapted to tho country's needs, and one that could become a law, and we will pass it in the Fifty-third Congress. If we fail in the elections then the informa tion has been obtained, and we can keep on until the country. is educated against tho McKmley bill." F1KLD DAY IX THE SENATE.

The bill provides for the increase of infantry regiments to twelve compauies. otlicered as at present, with the addition of Junior officers for the two proposed addi tional companies, the bill also proposed to increase the enlisted force of the army to thirty thousand men. Mr. Piatt asked for the appointment of three commissioners torevise the statutes relating to patents, trade and other marks, so far as the statutes relates to matterscon taiued in or ailccted by tho convention for the protection of industrial prosperity, con cluded at Paris in 1883.

This is the same bill introduced in the Senate by Mr. Plumb last year, with a few amendments, increasing from J0 to SO per cent, tho gold and silver reserve fund lor tho redemption of United States notes, forbidding thofree coinage in the United States of foreign coin, and authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, to call for pay ment of customs dues in gold or silver in whole or in part.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Senator Paddock Says It Is the Ablest State Paper Ever Sent to Congress. .Special to tlie Indianapolis Journal. , Washington, Dec. 10. Senator Paddock, chairman of the Senate committee on agri culture and forestry, after a careful read ing of President Harrison's message, said of it to-day: "It i one of the very strongest and ablest state papers that over emanated from the executive ofiico. It is a magnifi cent presentation of the executive and leg islative work of the past year an exposi tion of Republican policies and Repub lican accomplishments which will be received with enthusiastic com mendation by every Republican every where. It cannot fail to excite a powerful influence upon tbo world's esti mate of our growth, financial strength and general prosperity. In viuor, comprehen siveness and lucidity of statement it is a masterpiece. Tho recommendations as to new legislation are in several im portant respects original, und in most respects will msrit tho wishes of the conservative people of the West. After this great document nothing further will bo required to convince even his most uucharitablo partisan opponent that President Harrison is one of the strong est thinkers, ablest statesmen, and withal one of the best quipped in respect of liter ary attainments of all our Presidents from the beginning." Tito KiiKlLh Opinions. London, Dec. 10. The St. .lames Gazette, commenting to-day on President Harrison's message to the American Congress, says that the most important point iu the docu ment is that part which has reference to tho results of the McKinley tariff. The figures presented, tho Gazette declares, compare significantly with Uritish figures which remain stationary. It is all very well to say that tbo Americans will present ly disoovcr the mistake in their fiscal pol icy, but. rerhaps. they may not. In tho meantime the calculations of the support ers of the McKinley bill aro working out much better than auy ono in England had reason to exrecr. Tho Globe sarcastically comments on tho message, which, it says, is odroitly traced on ratch-voto lines. In some passages 6pread-eaelemm is served np hot: in others nervous Yankees are assured that the gov ernment knows how to climb down asm the case of Chili and the P.ehring sea dis pute. Lord Salisbury, the Globe adds, need not b much frightened nt President Harrison's tremendous menace and expres sion of concern at foreitin encroachments upon territories controlled by American government. Tho paper further snys that if Venezuela pasrd under American con trol the least that could be expected would be that the suzerain power would forth with guarantee tho Venezuelan debt. The Globe disputes tho statement made in the messago that the prosperity of the United States is entirely due to tho McKinley bill. On tho contrary, it says, the prosperity of the country is due to an exceptional har vest there at a time when Luropo is short of grain. Itotlin! on tliff Nrw Orleans Lynching. Home. Dec. 10. In the Chamber of Depu ties, to-day, replying to a question asked by ignor Campi on Italy's relations with the United States, Premier Rndmi said that he had taken note of the friendly ex pressions contained in President Harrison's message, and felt confident that the ques tions at issue between the two countries would soon be settled. The London Chronicle's correspondent in Rome says: "I he United States govern ment has given the Italian government a semi ollicial promise to po modify the Amer ican Constitution as to insure the most ab solute protection to foreigners. Upon this promise the Italian government intimates its willingness to regard tho New Orleans dispute as closed."

Chancellor DUcutses In the Reichstag the Commercial Treat if Juot Negotiate!. BniiLLV. Dec 10. In tho Kcichstag to-day Chancellor Von Caprivi opened the debate on the now commercial treaties. He mado a strong appeal in favor of their adoption. He dwelt upon the fact that home indus tries had received a great impetus under the last customs regimes, to much to that overproduction had caused some embarrass ment. The present import and export re lations, ho d eel area, would ruin both the employers and employes. Tho commercial measures under discussion, therefore, wero necessary to preserve Germany's husbandry and commerce The Chancellor added that tho government had accepted the principle of assimilating Germany's interests with those of other states, and concessions had to be mado accordingly. These concessions had entailed great sacrifices upon thot who had mado them. It was the duty of tho Reichstag to givo husbandry the sup port it requires, and to prescrvo its rela tions with trade. This, tho Chancellor said, was tho principle which had guided the government iu negotiating tho treaties. Continuing, tho Chancellor said that the immediato elTect of the treaties upon tho finances of the empire would be a diminu tion in revenue amountingto nearly 1,000, 000 marks. This was a matter that re quired budget consideration. In regard to the question of the differential treatment of countries not included in tbe treaties, those countries having most favored na tion treatment would receive tho benefits ot the treaties. Regarding other countries, negotiations wero nbout to open whereby Germany would endeavor to obtain con cessions. It was needless to speak of Rus sia. The lamentable distress that prevailed in that country, causing a stoppage of ex ports, would not be removed for some time, and it was useless to discuss what would be done afterwards. As regards the United States, the two governments had decided to continue to take theirstand on the basis of the arrangements of 15, wherebj' the United States received most favored nation treatment. In any caso the government had no intention to inko a further reduc tion of tarilVs. In the meantime the federal governuient formally withstood all at tacks. In connection with alleged distress in Germany, he said he was likely to see that the agriculturist had done more to n.a.n tain duties than the government, especially in the eastern provinces, where protective tarill's were of ellect, if anywhere. Never theless, if it had not b.'en for these tr.rill.1 an agricultural crisis would havo com upon the couutry which might have lasted for years. Farmers, to whichever party they belonged, must be reckoned among tho elements by which the state was up held. The agriculture of tbe country could very well bear, without risk, n reduction in tho tariff rate of 1L mark. The raising of the rute to 5 marks had been an experi ment which had answered tbe purpose of the federal government. In fact, it had been considered how far tanft' rates allect ing agriculture could bo reduced without in jury to the country. In the matter of wine, it bad been the aim to creato sharp competition against artificial . win-s, schnapps and tbo so-called "French clar ets," so as to provide on German soil a Uat- tle-field for Italian wines, as against those of France. The reduction in duties on nec essaries of life was of advantage to tho workine people. Ho concurred lu the say ing of Chaplain Stoecken "We must not only go forth against undue claims of tbe workmtn, but' we must make advances toward him." Referring to the treaties of Pelginm and Switzerland, the Chancellor said: "Lett ut any time wo are unablo to preserve peace, it inupt be our desire to possess us many faithful allies as possible. These we will be able to gain by smoothing the path of politic-commercial relations, since the end of tho last century it has been impossible to conclude a Cabinet convention between government and government. The heart of the people must also opprove." Adverting to the McKinley law, tbe Chnncellor said: "We wish the countries of Europe to preserve their independence against America. For this purpose they must unito together. The treaties just con cluded will give a sure guarantee of tho future." The debate was adjourned. At a meeting of the C onservative mem bers of the Reichstag twelve voted in favor of and twenty-four against the treaties. Herr Kardoli read a telegram stating that Prince Pismarck did not intend to appear during tho debate. Such crowds of peoplo gathered around the Reichstag building in the hope of see ing Prince liieniaick enter that tho police had trouble to securo an entrance for tho ministers. Mauy bets were made on Princo Pismarck's appearance. Chancellor Von Caprivi's speech is described as or.o of tho grentt-et masterpiece of oratory and states manship ever heard in tho Reichstag. Princo Pismarek had a full summary of the speech telegraphed to him while tho Chancellor was still speaking. Tho pose of the Chancellor during his speech was the ono he usually adopts an uttitudn like a military statue, with his hands resting on his sword, and making not the slightest move ment or gesticulation except at rare intervals. It was a stranue sic Lit to see u general iu uuitorm laying down the laws of commerce, industry nnd acn culture before an assembly of land-i.wLers, merchants aud others. The Chancellor was somewhat hoarse, and mauy of the Dcp'i. ties crowded around him to hearhis wds more dihtinctly. but his voice waa ai-Cible throughout tho hou'. now Tin: ciiir;8i: tight.
