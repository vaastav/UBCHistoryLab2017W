Wo give entire, to.iiny, the Annual Mes sage of President Lind Congress n, submitted to Monday. In view of the ] sent condition of our national affairs, it is by odds the most important Presidential docu ment that lias emanated from the Kxecutive since the days of Washington. A9 i tomary with Mr. Lincoln in all his official papers, he is brief, pointed and conclusive in his reasonings. One of his chiefest neculi arities is the exhaustive manner in which he deals with a subject. The Message before is pre-eminently marked in this respect, and carries with it, moreover, i tence, the most undeniable evidences of a true, honest, sincere desire to serve and save the country, independent of ull other consi derations whatever. every Upon the slavery question, the President is frank, manly and fair iu his arguments pro ; and i I that subject forms part of the message, it is worthy of the care r ul special attention of the people of Delaware; and to them By adopting his they apply to State action, wo of Delaware may, without pecuniary loss commend i commendations far as injury of any kind, wheel our glorious little State into the ranks of tho free States of the North, und march onward with them in a career of glory impeded ouly by the foul aud prosperity presence of slavery—and that merely nal slavery too—within our borders. Letus then shako off foolish prejudices, und. thrusting tlie politicians and place hunters aside, c terminedly, and by accepting the pluH of the 'President, show to the world that up to the work honestly and de desire not only a united country but also a free and happy one forever.

The iron is driven the deeper, und our burdens be und more heavy. And though than eighteen mouths have passed sitice the strife was begun, the end seems more distant than it appeared to be a twelve-month since. Hope after hope has in darkness, and expectations we had fondly cherished have turned out to be miserable delusions.
