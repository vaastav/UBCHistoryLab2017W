4 Treasury gold bullion amounting to $138, 502.545. The provision made for strengthening the resources of the Treasury in connec tion with the war has given increased confidence In the purpose and power of the Government to maintain the. present standard and has established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. A i afked evidence of < this is found in the inflow of gold to the Treas ury. Its net gold holdings on November 1, 1898, were

November 1. 1898, was 25.35 per cent, as compared with 16.9G per cent No vember 1. 1897. I renew so much of my recommendation of December. 1897. a* follows: That when any of the United States notes - are presented for redemption and are re deemed in gold, such not-« shall be kept and pet apart and only paid out in exchange for Kold. This la on obvious" duty. If the holder of ■ United states note prefers gold anil gets it from the Government he should not . receive back from the United States a note with- Proposed Currency Legislation. cut paying gold for it in exchange. The rea " ■on for this Is made all the more apparent i when the Government issue an Interest bearing | debt to provide gold for the redemption of, I'nited States notes, a non-Interest bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way they may return again, to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them, another interest bearing debt to redeem a non-Interest bearing debt. This recommendation is made In the be lief that such provision of law would in sure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the gen eral business conditions of the country. In my Judgment the present condition of the treasury justifies the immediate en actment of the legislation recommended one year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when - once ■ redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. I It is not to be inferred that other legis lation relating to our currency is not re quired. On the contrary, there is an ob vious demand for it. The Importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now is to that of our commercial rivals, is generally recog nized. ■ The companion proposition that our do mestic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be BO related to the needs of our Industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition scarcely less important. The subject in all Its parts is commended to the wise consideration of Congress. The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States to Cuba.

It is our duly to furnish the people of Hawaii with facilities under national control for their export and im port trade. It will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation I which shall be prompt, durable and lib eral. The part which the American merchant vessels and their seamen performed in .ne i war with Spain demonstrates that this service, furnishing both pickets and the j ! line of defense, is a national ne cessity and should be encouraged In every ; constitutional way. Details and methods for the'accomplish ment of thi!« purpose are discussed in ' the report of the Secretary of the Treas ury to which the attention of Congress is I respectfully invited. In my last annual message I recom- ! mended that Congress authorize the ap pointment of a committee for the purpose of making .systematic Investigations with reference to the cause and prevention of : yellow fever. This matter has acquired j an increased Importance as a result of the military occupation of the island of Cuba ' and the commercial Intercourse V -'tween '■ this Island and the I'nited States which I we have every reason to expect. The san- t itary problems connected with our rela tioas with the island of Cuba ana the ac quisition of Porto Rico are no less impor tant than those relating to finance, com mefce and administration. It is iy earn- | est wish that these problems may be eun sldered by competent experts, "and that j everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitary science can Offer for the protection of "the health of i our soldiers in those islands and of our citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infection from the importation of yel low fever. I therefore renew my recom- ! mendation that the authority of Congress i may be given and a suitable "appropriation made to provide for a committee of ex- ; pprts to be appointed for the purpose In- i dicated. Under the act of Congress approved April 26, 1898, authorizing the President in I his discretion upon a | declaration of war by I Congress or a declara tion by Congress that 1 war exists. I directed i the increase of the regu- i Increase of the Regular Army. lar army to the maxi mum of 62,000. authorized in said act. There are now in the regular army 57,862 officers and men. In said act It was pro vided "that at the end of any war in \ ■which the United States may become in volved the army shall be reduced to a | peace basis by the transfer in the same : arm of the service or absorption by pro- j motion or honorable discharge, under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish, of supernumerary commanding - officers and the honorable discharge or transfer of supernumerary enlisted men. j and nothing contained in this act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent Increase of the command or enlisted force of the regular army beyond that now pro- i vided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act. except as to the in- j crease of twenty-five majors provided for in section 1 thereof. The importance of legislation for the | permanent increase of the army is, there fore, manifest, and the recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose I has my unqualified approval. There can be no question that at this time, . and probably for some time in the future. 100,- ! 000 men will be none too many to meet the necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that number shall be required permanently or not. the power should be given to the President to enlist that force ' if. in his discretion, it should be neces- i sary, and the further discretion should be | given him to recruit within the above : limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are I charged. It is my purpose to muster out the en tire volunteer army as soon as Congress \ shall provide for the increase of tne reg- : ular establishment. This will be only an ' act of justice, and will be much appre- . ciated by the brave men who left their homes . and employments to help * their | country in its emergency. In my last annual mesage I stated: The Union Pacific Railroad, main line, was Fold under the decree of the United State* : court for the 'District of Nebraska, the Ist | and 2d of November of this year.

By a decree of the court In | that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which would yield to the Government only $2,500,000 upon its | lion. The sale at the instance of the Gov- j eminent was postponed first to December 35, 1897, and later, upon the application of the United States, w;is postponed to Feb ruary IS, 1891 Having satisfied myself that the inter ests of the Government required that an effort should be made to obtain a larger j sum 1 directed the Secretary of the Treas ury, under the ait passed March 8, LBB7, to 'pay out of the treasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the amounts j due upon all prior mortgages upon the middle and eastern divisions of said rail road, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated. Whereupon the Attorney General pre- ; pared a petition to be presented to the j court offering to redeem said prior liens ; in such manner as the court might direct j and praying that thereupon the T'nited Btatei might be held to be subrogated to nil rights of said prior lien holders and | that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain and operate the same until the i court or Congress otherwise directed, i Thereupon the reorganization committee j agreed that if said petition were with- I drawn and the sale allowed to proceed on ] K. bruary 16 they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the Govern ment the entire principal of its debt, $6,303,000. Relieving that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficulties under which the Government would labor | If it should become the purchaser of the road at a sale, in the absence of any au thority by Congress to take charge of and operate the road. I directed that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the principal of its debt, the sale should proceed. Ky this transaction the Government secured an advance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price and which the reorganization committee had declared was the maxi mum which they would pay for the prop- I erty. It i.s gratifying to know that the result of this proceeding against the Union Pa cific system and the Kansas Pacific line Is that the Government has received on j account of its subsidy claim the sum of i $84,751,533 ">, an increase of $18397463 75 over the sum which the reorganization committee originally agreed to bid for the j"iin property, the Government receiving its whole claim principal and interest on the Union Pacific and the principal of its deW on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. Steps had been taken to foreclose the Government's lien upon the Central Paci- lie Railroad Company, but before action was commenced Congress passed an act, approved July 7, 1898, creating a commission consisting | Debt of the Central Pacific. of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior, and their suc cessors in office, w.*h full power to settle the indebtedness to the Government grow ing out of the issue of bonds in aid of construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond-aided railroads, subject to the approval of the President. ! No report has yet been made to me by the j committee thus created. Whatever action j is had looking to a settlement of the in debtedness in accordance with the bill re- | ferred to will be duly submitted to Con gress. I deem it my duty to call to the atten tion of Congress the condition of the pres- ! ent building- occupied by the Department of Justice. The business of that depart ment has increased greatly since it was established in its present quarters. The building now occupied by it is neither large enough nor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of the busi ness of the department. The supervising architect has pronounced it unsafe and unsuited for the use to which it is put. The Attorney General in his report states that the library of the department is on the fourth floor and that all the space al lotted to it is so crowded with books as to dangerously overload the structure. The first floor is occupied by the Court of Claims. The building is of an old and i dilapidated appearance, unsuited to the. dignity which should attach to this im portant department. A proper regard for the safety, comfort and convenience of the officers and em ployes would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in the erection of a ne.w building of commodious proportions and handsome appearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for that purpose, including tho ground occu pied by the present structure and vacant ground adjoining to that comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet on Pennsylvania avenue and a depth of 136 feet. In this conclusion it may be wise to refer to the inadequate accommodations provided for the Supreme Court in the Capitol, and suggest the wisdom of making provision i for the erection of a separate building for! the court and its offices and library upon available ground near the Capitol. The postal service of tiie country ad vances with extraordinary growth. With- ; in twenty years both the revenues and expendi tures of the Postofflce Department have multi plied threefold. In the last ten years they have Growth of Postal Service.  , nearly doubled. Our postal business grows much more rapidly than our population. It now involves an expenditure of $100.uu0,000 a year, numbers i .3.000 postofflces and enroUa 200,000 em ployes. This remarkable extension of ' service, which is an accurate index of the j public conditions, presents gratifying evi dence of the advancement of education, of the increase or commtinu atmn aim business activity and of the improvement of mall facilities, leading to their con stantly augmenting use. The war with Spain laid new and excep tional labors in the Postofflce D' oartment pie mustering of tne military and navai forces of the I'nited States remiired spe cial mail arrangements for every camp and every campaign. The communication | en home and camp was naturaliv eager and expectant. In some of the i larger places of rendezvous as many as i 50.0W letter a day required handling. This ! necessity was met by the prompt detail <il experienced men from the established force and by directing all the instru mentalities of the railway mail and postofflce service so tar as necessary to this new need. Congress passed an act empowering me Postmaster Gener al to establish an offlrn or branch at every military camp or station and under this authority tne postal machinery was speedily put into effective operation. Inrler the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba. Porto Kico and the Philippines, they were attended and followed by the postal service. Though j the act of Congress authorized the ap pointment of postmasters where neces sary, it was early determined that the public Interests would be best subserved not by new designations, but •>>• the <ln tail of experienced men familiar with every branch of the service, and this pol icy was steadily followed. When the ter ritory which was the theater of conflict came, into our possession it became necessary to rp-estahliHh mail facili ties for the resident population as well as to provide them for our forces of occupation and the for mer requirement was met through th<> ex tension and application of the latter obli ffntinn. I gave the requisite authority and the same general principle was applied to this ttß to other branches of rivil .".dminis trntion under military subjection. The details are more particularly given in the report of the Postmaster General, and while the work is only just begun, it is plc;islng to be able to say that the ser vice in the territory which hns come un der our control is already materially im proved.

This is necessary in view of the large amount of work which must be performed in the preparation of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population. There were on the pension rolls June 30, 1898, 993,714 names, an Increase of nearly 18,000 over the number on the roll on the same day of the preceding year. The amount appropri ated by the act of De cember 22. 189fi, for the Almost a Million Pensioners. payment of the pensions [or the fiscal year 'lB<lS was ?140,000,000. Kiigrnt million seventy thousand eight hun dred and seventy-two dollars and forty six rents was appropriated by the act of March 31, 18S8, to cover deficiencies in army pensions, and repayments in the sum of $12,020 33. making a total of $148, 082,892 79 available for the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount disbursed from that sum was JIH.CdI.S79 80. leaving a balance of $3,4:u. 012 99 unexpended on the 30th of June, 1898, which was covered into the treasury. There were 3X9 names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at tno second session of the Fifty-fifth Con gress, making a total of 6486 pensioners by Congressional enactments since 1861. fh« total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were $1,253,948 44. The expenditures were $1,081,633 79, leaving a surplus of $172,314 65. The public lands disposed of by the Gov ernment during the year reached 8.453, 896.92 acres, an increase of 614.780.26 acres over the previous year. The total receipts irom public lands during the fiscal year amounted to $2,277,995 18, an increase of J1W.063 90 over the preceding year. The lands embraced in the eleven forest reser vations which were suspended by the act of June 4. 1897, again became subject to the operations of the proclamations of I-ebruary 22, 1897, creating them, which added an estimated amount of 19.951,360 acres to the area embraced in the re serves previously created. In addition thereto, two new reserves were created (hiring tne year— the Pine Mountain and /.aca Lake reservation in California, em bracing 1.C44.H94 acres, and the Prescott reservation in Arizona, embracing 10.240 acres, while the Pecos River, in New Mexico, has been changed and enlarged to include 120,000 additional acres. At the close of the pear thirty forestry reservations, not including those of the Afognac forest and the fish culture re serve in Alaska, had been created by ex ecutive proclamation under section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, embracing an es timated area of 4,719,454 acres.

The reports received indicate that the system of the patrol has not only pre vented destructive fires from gaining headway, but has diminished the num ber of fires. The special attention of Congress is called to that part of the report of the Secretary of the Interior in relation to the five civilized tribes, li is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows marked progress. But one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year, and that among the Chippewa In dians of Minnesota, which, happily, has been suppressed. While it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the act of June 28, 1898. "for the protection of the people of Indian Territory and for other purposes." it is having a salutary effect on the five tribes. The Dawes Commis sion reports that the most gratifying re sults and greater advance toward the at tainment of the objects of the Govern ment have been secured in the past year than in any previous year. I cannot too strongly indorse the recommendation of the commission and the Secretary of the Interior of the necessity for providing for the education of the 80,000 white children resident in the Indian Territory.

EATON ELECTED MAYOR OF THE ANGEL CITY But One Candidate on the Democratic Muni cipal Ticket Successful. FRED EATON, NEWLY ELECTED MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES. LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.— The Republicans swept the city in the election to-day. For the first time in ten years seven out of nine Re publicans are elected to the City Council. Fred Katon has been elect ed Mayor by 600 majority. He defeated M. P. Snyder, incumbent, by a narrow margin. Snyder made all kinds of combinations. A total of about 14.000 votes were cast. This was about 1000 less than were cast at the State election. Only one Democrat on the city ticket was elect ed. That was Captain C. 11. Hance, the present City Clerk. A verey sharp tight was waged against John Drain, the present Superintendent of Streets and Republican candidate for re-election, but he has been re-elected by 500 majority. J. H. Dockweiler. the present City Engineer, has been defeated for re-election by 1000 ma jority. Snyder for Mayor carried the Second, Seventh and Eighth Wards. The last two are nominally Democratic, but the Second Ward Snyder carried by a combination he made with the oil men to give them anything they desired. All the corporations in the city supported Snyder and opposed Eaton. The managers of the gas, electric light and street railway ccompanies were in the field actively antagonizing Eaton and lining up votes for Snyder from the time the polls opened until they closod. The new charter, which was advocated by both parties, was snowed under. American people that a message an nouncing the victorious ending of the great war, the acquisition of territory and the initiation of an imperialist policy is sober in tone and moderate in recommendations. The war has finally healed the half-closed wounds left by the Titanic contests of secession and we hope it has exercised a healing influence to be felt even more widely and deeply in another direction. Not since England recognized the United States Government's power has an American President alluded to the mother country in language so cordial and friendly as Mr. McKinley's. Discussing th^ message approving the detail and referring to British rights in Nicaragua under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, the Times says: "If the free dom of the waterways is secured to the ships of all nations we shall not need to stand strictly upon claims which origi nated when the circumstances were al together different." The Daily Chronicle also pays a trib ute to the "sober soun 1 common sense and straightforward language" of the message, pointing out that President McKinley's reference to the military oc cupation of Cuba virtually outlines a policy "precisely the same as that of Great Britain in Egypt and likely to have the same effect." Commenting on the President's "sur prising language" concerning the Nicaragua canal, which utterly ignores British treaty rights, the Daily Chronicle says that "this matter will arise ere long in a more acute form." The editorial highly approves Mr. Mc- Kinley's references to China and Great Britain. The Standard says: "Few could have foretold that the war would work so rapid and drastic a change. How absolute the metamorphosis is may best be gathered from a comparison with previous messages. It is not rash to predict that the United States will advance in the path upon which their feet are now firmly set." The Standard construes Mr. McKin ley's references to China as a declara tion that, had the open door been closed or obstructed, America would have interfered < ctively. It adds, upon tuis point, "For all purposes of British policy no intimation could be more welcome than that the United States will appoint a committee to study the conditions in China." The Daily Telegraph, which regards the announcement that the United States will support the open door in China as the weightiest which the message contains, says: "With such common interests to unite us, formal alliances are unnecessary." The Daily Mail says: "We are dis appointed and surprised at this at tempt to set aside the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, especially in view of the Anglo- American entente." The Morning Post, on the other hand, says: "Circumstances have changed and the American attitude toward the treaty is quite intelligible, but the im mediate task awaiting Mr. Chamber lain Is the ussimilation into his ad mirable sentimental view of the Anglo-American relations of the thorny problem associated with the Clayton-Bulwer treaty."

GUN PLANT FOR NEWPORT NEWS Englishmen Negotiate With Huntington. INTEREST IN YARD SOUGHT DEAL THAT WILL MEAN A GREAT ENTERPRISE. The Railroad Magnate Says the New Establishment Will Be a Benefit to This Country. Special Dispatch to The Call. NEW YORK, Dec. s.— Collis P. Huntington confirmed to-day's report that the English firm of Vlckers' Sons & Maxim fs negotiating for an interest in the Newport News shipbuilding establishment, in which he is a heavy owner. He said the deal had not been closed, and denied there was any In tention of selling the yard outright to English interests, and intlmnted he would continue to control the business. "I have been in negotiation, " said Huntington, "with Vickers' Sons & | Maxim, who have thought of taking large interests in the plant and of establishing at Newport News, in con nection with the ship yard, a very ex tensive plant for the manufacture of guns. If these negotiations should be carried to a conclusion there would be established at Newport News a new industry which would greatly benefit the city, furnishing work and support to thousands of people in addition to those there now. But the yard would continue to be an American enterprise, as I do not propose to sell the holdings outright, but to rent a large interest. I would like, however, to lessen my cares and responsibilities and let others take up and carry on the work I have | started. "The proposed gun plant would not be a separate organization. It would be conducted as a part of the general business. I have wanted those people to take a large interest because I was anxious to see a great gun manufac turing establishment put up at New port News, and my impression is my English friends will find it greatly to their interest to complete negotia tions. I think, too, it will be a good thing for the Government. The Vickers' Sons & Maxim are known over the whole world for their skill and success in making great ships and all sizes of guns.

SAN JOSE, Dec. 4.— The Republican County Central Committee, through which "Boss" Rea and "Johnnie" Mac kenzie made the fight for their candi dates, is bankrupt. Not only is the ex chequer depleted, but there is between $1000 and $1200 worth of bills still un paid. About fifty creditors are pursu ing John D. Mackenzie, secretary of the committee. The Game Warden has gra ciously told these people time and again that they would be paid "to-morrow or the next day," but this promise has been made to get the County Committee together, but unsuces fully. Over $3000 came into the hands of the committee through assessing candidates. Half of this sum has not been expended, and successful and defeated candidates are wondering where it all went. The committee started out at the be ginning of the campaign with some lofty ideas as to finances. It decided to assess its candidate for Sheriff $500 and all other nominees for county offices $400. There was a general protest among the candidates and they re belled. They finally contributed the following amounts set opposite their names, at least their sworn statements so show: R. J. I.angford, Sheriff *3°" J. G. McMillen. Surveyor w W. F. Parker, Auditor Jou Rush McCoraae, Tax Collector 85"J B A. Herrington, District .Attorney IM> T. F. Morrison, County Clerk 300 J. C.

Faber. Superintendent of Schools — 150 J. K. Secord, Cumner 150 Total *2400 Aside from these amounts more money was put into the hands of the committee. W. T. Nolting and W. J. Kirkpatrick, candidate for Township Justices, fail to mention in their sworn statements any assessment paid to the committee, taut persons on the inside positively assert the Justices turned over $250 each. B. A. Herrington, for District Attorney, gave an additional $100 that he fails to mention. This makes $600, which, added to the $2400 heretofore mentioned, makes $3000. The question confronting the candi dates and the creditors is ho* - all this money was expended under the direc tion of Secretary John D. Mackenzie. There are about twenty livery stable keepers who have bills against the com mittee ranging from $20 to $25. They exhibit orders signed by Mackenzie, and it looks as though this is all they will get for the use of their teams. Band masters are clamoring for their money, while newspaper publishers and mer chants are pleading for pay. Even the heelers and clerks hired about the head quarters have not received their prom ised stipends. All the money was turned over to Mackenzie as secretary, and was to have been expended under his direction.

CUBANS SATISFIED WITH THE MESSAGE WASHINGTON, Dec. s.— General Garcia, who is still somewhat indis posed, spent the evening at his hotel. Mr. Quesada, speaking for the com mission, said: "The President's mes sage is regarded as very satisfactory. Its publication at this time wih do good, counteracting reports that Lave been spread in Cuba by people who have not the real interests of the country at heart. We have full faith in the United States and in the just intentions of President McKinley, and the men who have made the revolution of Cuba a success aim to work with the United States to establish a government that will have the respect of nations."
