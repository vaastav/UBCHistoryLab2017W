Frankly speaking, Mr. Greenwald I griddle. ing presidential messages with alarm. Their timidity and fear is unwarranted as long as Mr. Taft is president. His message to Congress and to the country is simply a plain business docu- j ment dealing with, national questions on a plain business way. It is lengthy, but it is worth reading. No one can go through it without becoming con vinced that our president is able to grapple with the big public questions in the right way. If they would only let Mr- Taft alone; if the political cabals would only quit trying to badger aim! The country is safe with Mr. Taft. Business was never more firmly con vinced of that than it is today after reading Mr. Taft's message. doesn't know his own mind two minutes. He is as vaccilating as a weather vane in a gale of wind- Take the deputy-ship at East Chicago as only one instance. When Patterson became persona non grata there, his resignation was demanded and Greenwald accepted it. Then the latter insisted on the head of Deputy Prosecutor Bartholomew on a charger, to the astonishment of East Chicago and the indignation of a host of Mr. Bartholomew's friends. Mr. Bartholomew resigned and J. D. Kennedy was appointed in his place. Then Greenwald announced with much flourish, of trumpets the appointment of Attorney Frank Baranowski as deputy at Indiana Harbor and the appoint ment was approved by a large number. Last night Greenwald went after Baranowski, chopped off his official head and reappointed Patterson, whose resignation he had accepted. There is as much soreness at Gary over Green- wald's action as at East Chicago- What sort of a child's game is Greenwald playing anyway?

By Farmer Smith. "Alt right, aH right," said Br'er Rab- The soft wind was whispering bit as he hopped away as fast as he through the trees one morning early could. He soon came back with five when Br'er Rabbit poked his head out acorns and said to his wife: "You would of his hole and then went back to Mrs. hardly think that one of these acorns Rabbit. , will make a great big oak tree if you "I think this is a beaultful world," Put it in the ground and leave it there." said Br'er Rabbit to his wife, "and I "It is very wonderful," said Mrs. Rab love to go out each morning and see bit. "but let's take the good out of what there is new. I keep my eyes It and nil it with pepper." and ears open more than I used to." j Br'er Rabbit and his wife worked "Yes," said Mrs. Rabbit, "I am just and wrked with their sharp claw s, and beginning to see the beautiful things soon thGy nad the Asides of the acorns myself. I think the reason I never nicly scraped out. Then Mrs. Rab saw them before is because I did not blt went i,lto their garden and got look for them. By the way, have you some red PPPers with which to fill the seen Mr. Jay Bird recently?" "No, I have not, and I will tell you I have been wondering and wondering what I can do to get even with that rascal. You know he is the joker of the birds, and is always playing jokes on everybody, and I am getting tired of it," said Br'er Rabbit. "What does he like to eat?" asked Mrs. Rabbit. "He is very fond of acorns and also eggs. Why, he Is so foolish he will go Where The Spotlight Twinkles empty acorns. She heard her husband calling her, so she rushed home. Far above them in the top of a tree sat Mr. Jaybird just as sassy as you please. Br'er and Mrs. Rabbit crawled into their hole and every now and then threw out one of the acorns. By and by Mr. Jay Bird came down from the top of the tree and grabbed one of the acorns, and then he began to sing: "Guess I'll fly up in the tree. Take a little acorn 'long with me."

What a desire we mortals have tojMayor Thomas Knotts and the nine condition in the Crown Point jail. Prisoners have been lost there and forgotten- Dr. Oberlin went to Crown Point to investigate health conditions and found that there are many prisoners who have been compelled to languish In jail for months at a time simply' because their cases were never called to trial. This term of court the prosecutor has asked that four weeks be given to criminal work. This is the longest period of time that has ever been de voted to this class of court work. But the prosecutor should long ago have insisted on having his prisoners tried and the jails cleaned out upon the con clusion of the criminal work of each term of court. It is a theory in law that it is better that nine guilty men be allowed to go free rather than one innocent person be punished. "Under the present manner of conducting the work of the prosecutor's office, nine out of every ten persons who are unable to furnish bail are punished, even in the absence of proof of guilt, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of from one to six months. 

WATCHING THE CONSTABLES. People in the Calumet region are from Missouri on the constable proposi tion, having had considerable experience with the genus constable, and it will require something more than mere organization on the part of the latter to inspire confidence in their methods. However, the fact that they are or ganizing in North township has placed the public in a receptive mood re garding their possible improvement. If that not over critical aggregation gets an inkling that the officials who held down the jobs of right hand to the justices of the peace are in earnest, it will stand ready to applaud, but it must be certain in the first place that the organization means something more than mere wind. If there is one office more than another In this community which needs purging, it is that of constable and the constables can do a heap of improve ing before they reach a condition of over-scrupulousness. DEMOCRATS TO DISCARD OLD LEADERS. It is now reported that the democratic chieftains down around Indian apolis have their eye on Lake county, looking over the available party work ers for a leader in local county affairs. Who ever he is, will, of course, have to stand in with the governor and powers that be. He must not be a Knotts or Becker graduate, as such qualifications will not give him any prestige at court. The whole situation looks like a new order of things, democratic, in the country. For the last time the old guard has fought and the state committee is looking for an or ganizer and a pacificer. In the meantime it Is interesting to recount the changes that a year has, made in Lake county, democratic circles. DON'T buy any Christmas litera ture, Mr. Taft's message will be forth- ing and you can put in youf spare moments reading this. ; IF Lake county doesn't need a criminal court running full blast, night and day, a lot of the lawyers do not know what it does need.
