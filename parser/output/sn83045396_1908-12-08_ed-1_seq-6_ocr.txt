ANANIAS CLUB BOLL-GALL. Tho country is again odificd by a par tial calling of the roll of tho Ananias club by President Uoosovolt. His lot tor stigmatizing tho editor of tho Tn dinunpolitj News as an atrocious liar and tho editor of tho Niw York Sun as oven a morn monstrous one, because of their probing into what they call tho Panama canal scandal iB not as convincing ns one could wish, although its vigor can not bo disputed. Tho charge of thoso editors as to tho participation of cer tain Americans, call it an American syndicate or not, iu the dividing of tho $10,000,000 paid over by this coun try to the French government for tho French rights in Panama, docs not necessarily rest, as President Roosevelt undertakes to put it, upon official docu ments in tho archives of this country Undoubtedly President Roosevelt is ab solutely correct in stating that there aro no secret records iu this matter, and that everything official is open and abovo board. In to far as those editors have cither stated or implied to the contrary thoy aro undoubtedly wrong. It docs not necessarily follow, howovur, that they aro willful liars or that they mean to deceivo the rcadors of their papers. They think that thoy havo corac upon the clue of certain largo pay ments from that Panama canal fund to people in this country. It hasboen oc casionally stated for a long tiino that William Nolson Cromwell, tho active intermediary in tbo largo deal, benofitod tremendously throngh the transaction. Wo havo seen it oxpliailly stated that he got a million dollars for his service?. Of course he did not get this through any payment to him by tho government of this country. His payment, it has always been understood, was madfl from Franco, and camo from the pool which represented tbo French stockholders who had lost so trcmcudousb' in tho Panama canal venture from Do Letiseps's optimistic plans and reports. It was the general understanding, pre cisely as President Roosevelt slates, that this money was paid over directly to the French government, and paid there in full. And, further, ho is un doubtedly right whore he states that thoro ore no secret pnpors, no secret archives, no sccrol memoranda so far as ibis country is coucernod. It does not follow cither, as tho President urges, that tho French govornntout was en gaged in anything illegitimate, or that any charges rest against that govern mont, even If large payments wore made to persons iu this country out. of that fund. Tbo French government simply received that money as tho representa tive of tho French Panama canal 3'udi cato, which endeavored by this transac tion to recover as much as could bo re covered for the stockholders of tho French Isthmian Canal company, it. be ing conceded that that company was at the end of Us resources and could not possibly go au3 further in tho way of constructing that canal. Tho French government, in paj'iug over tho money to that syndicate, cleared itself of its obligation, and it :s entirely wrong to say that the Freuch government is necessarily attacked when it is claimed that largo paymcuts from that $-10,000,-000 fund wore made to Americans. The French government cleared itself of all responsibility in the mailer when it paid over tho nionoy to tho French syudicato. Tho French S3-ndicato may havo agreed to pay conimissious, couusol fees, etc., to very large amounts lo certain Americans. In business circles those payments would bo rccogmzed as legitimate, and certainly neither this government nor the French govern mont hod anything whatever to do with nor any responsibility in couucctioD there with. President Roosevelt is ontitled, no doubt, to clear his brother-in-law and all who had anything to do with this matter officially in this country from any responsibility with respect to the payment of anj' monc3' on this account. Wc fully believe that he is right in making thoso clearances. At the same time, we insist that those editors. may have knowledge of certain paymcuts to porsons in this country, to Cromwell and to others, that would be in a way reprehensible. Tho responsibility for those irregular payments, however, if any wcro made, must rest botweou tho person receiving the money and tho French canal 'syndicate which paid it. Tho loiter of President Roosovolt., whilo clearing tho government abiolutel3 and, as we think. ncedlOHSty. docs not in tho least ontor into this ultimate phase of ihe question, which undoubtedly was in the minds of tho editors in making their presentation of what thoy believed to be facts. Wo think that President Roosevelt's Icttor would have been much better and stronger if he bad not undertaken lo' pillory thoso editors as willful and vicious liars, beyond what is necessar3" to tho exculpation of this government in all its oOlcial relations from charges mado by those editors, and from any connection with objec tionable payments in this country or olscwhere. Tbore was no reason in the world why this government should be engaged in auy underhand or illicit official dealings with respect to that Panama canal tranBaction. Wo do not believe for one moment that there were any such underhand or illicit dealings. We do not beliovo that there was anything secret in tbo matter eo far at our government is concerned, from first to last. It was a good purcha&e for us. It cleared away the Freuch claim and we got full value in work done and machinery obtained for the $10,000,000. Undoubtedly a good deal more value in work was ob tained by us than the $-10,000,000 paid for it. At. the same timo it. was a good deal for tho French stockholders, be cause thoy. got back a. little of what thoy paid. But for this they would have got nothing, And- wo sec no oc casion for any rancor in thiB matter, nor for tho pulsing of blame back and forth in an5- waj Certainly it is un just, to attack this government or the French govcrnmont by reason o that transaction. And if the French stock holders and their syndicate wcro cou tented to pay Cromwell and other Amcr icans considerable sums of mouc3 for negotiating tho deal, either by commis sion or for .i.ttoruoys' sorvicos, thro is nothing in that to warrant aii3" vicious attacks bj anybody. Neither this gov ernment nor tho French government would havo any authority to prevent those payments, nor an3 object or right in undertaking to stop them. As a question for newspaper inquiry, tho prying into Uioso pa3'mcnts is in a way legitimate, bocause tho public of this country would bo glad to kuow all about that mattor. Where, however, there was any attack upon this governmout or any intimatiou of secret deals or wrong, tho editors in question woro f.urel3' wrong, and thoy departed from their logitimatc inquir3 when they undertook to establish a thing that docs not in tho least exist. THE 

FLEET AND THE ENTENTE. We find the following editorial with 'rcspoct to the navy in tho Springfield (Mass.) Republican: The Japanese war scare having been laid nt rest with much solemnity hy Secretary Hoot and Embassador Takuhlra, tho Providence Journal pertinently In quires "whether It Is necessary, .consid ering tho 'understanding,' to build a hun dred and fifty millions dollars' worth of battleships for tho protection of the Pa cific const, pending the completion of tho Panama canal?" Logically, a new Pacific licet Is no longer nvd-J to "guarantoo peaco." for tho entente has provided that most admirably. But let us wait and seo what effect this latost development han upon tho new battleship programme. It Is hard to convince a navy maniac that ententes and understandings aro any thing but a Joke. Doubtless the agreement entered into between tho United States aud Japan, referred to above, is tho administration 's roph to the insistence upou the Pacific coast that the battleship tleot should havo remained in tho Pacific, in place of being returned to tho Atlantic, Wc do not. understand that the agreement referred to is in tho least to be consid ered as admitting President Roosovolt 's desire to discontinue building inoro ships for our nav On the contrary, the President is understood to be a9 finnl3' as over of the opiuion that tho continued expansion of the navy is ono of the great national needs, and that this will make for peace the world over. Wo havo beou inclined to agree with this view of tho President's, bo cause wc do uot boliovo for ono mo ment that this country could long re main at peace if its shores wore sub ject to raids with impuuit3' by tho great naval powers of the world. Nor do we bcliovc that the Monroe Doctrine, so called, would receive any consideration at tho hands of European governments if the United States did not havo a snfiicjent fleet to mnko our asscrtiou of lite Monroo Doctrine too formidable to be attacked. Wc agree with the sentiment in the quotation, however, that tho agreement entered into between the United States and Japau docs tend in a measure to strengthen tho argument against the building of a navy, aud cspec.iallj' ono for the protection pf our interests in the Pacilic and ou our west coast. Ac cepting the agreement at its face value, it is true that logically a groat Pacific fleet is no longer needed. But at auy moment that agreement ma- be over turned by bomo untoward circumstance, and at any timo wo ma3 be called upon to defend the Mouroc Doctrine on tho west, coast, of South Amorica, ns well as ou the oast, coast. Besidca, thoro aro other aggressors than Japan that might operate at any time in the Pa cific. Wc consider that the administra j tion weakened its position very materi ally by withdrawing tho battleship fleet from the west coast. And doubtless the agreement with Japau referred to is the reply to the criticism on that withdrawal; but iu that sort oi auswer the administration very largely gives its case away. Tho need of groat battleship floets ou tho Atlautic aud Pacilic coasts, how ever, rests upon reasons further back than anything covered in this recent agreement. And there is no certainty about tho vatificatiou of that agreement by the Senate. Already thoro appoar niutterings from Senators aaiust tho conclusion of such un international agrecmcut without consulting tho Sou ato about it. The Son'nte is liable to look upon this ugroement in the same way that it did upou tho first treat3' which Secretary Hay negotiated with tho British government with respect to the Panama caual. Tho Senate rejected that agreement, and insisted upon an agreement which would leave tho United Slates a. free band, cither for fortifications, or otherwise, on the Panama canal, . ouc, iu fact, that would turu the whole matter over to the Uuifcod States, without any bampcriug restrictions from Groat Britain. Tho Sonato is ver3' jealous of its treaty pre rogatives, and may tako into account also, besides its general objections to tho conclusion of an agreement of this kind without being consulted, the prop osition expressed in the above extract that logically this agreement works against the iucrcasinor of our navy iu the Pacific. Tho administration is nt a disadvantage on this point. Its po sition would have been much stronger if it had retained the bnttlesbH fleet in the Pacific and offered this agree ment ns a lofical -"suit of that retention. There is a new movement ou foot to 'have -the tariff taken off onious. Which is further proof thut tho re- vision sentiment is growing stronger ovciy da 3 THE 

PENSION AT SIXTY-TWO. Some years ago President Roosovolt. issued a. famous order to tho effect that veterans of tho war of the Re bellion who had' reached the ago of sixty-two years wcro thereby pre sumed to be disqualified for manual labor aud wore entitled to tho govern ment pension. A good many disputed tho lcgalit3' of this order, aud it was opposed for quite a while until Con gress ratified it by tho enactment of a statulo to tho same effect. Tho uncertaint3' about that order, the fact that it was issued after a good many of tho veterans had passed tho ago of 8ixt3-two, aud since the enact ment of Congross ratif3-ing the order was made at a timo u good man3 years subsequent to tho time whou largo numbers of tho veterans had passed the ago of sLty-two, and since the rulo of tho pensiou bureau is tbat tho appli cant docs not got his pension until he makes his application, and then ouhy from tho. timo at which he makes it, thoro is a good deal of confusion about tho practicnl working of this law pro viding for pensions of voterans who reach tho ago of sixty-two. Tt. would soom that tho intont of tho Executivo and of Congross was that surviving voterans of that war should reccivo thoir pension on arriving at tho ago of sixty-two. But a good many had passed that age before auvthing of this kind came up; and a good mau3" oth ers who had not paid much attention to tho mutter, lot the application drift on, thus losing considerable pension timo. SLnco, however, it was tho in tout of tho executive order and of Congress that veterans of tho war should obtain thoir pensiou from and after their arrival at tho age of sixtj' two years, thou tho law should bo mado clear on that point, and the timo that has elapsod. should not. be coustrued against thoso veterans. To mako good the intent of Congress, therefore, it would soem as though tho law should be amended to include tho pension pn3r tnonts from and after the age of sixty two years; that is. those who applied for ponsious some time subsoquout to their arrival at that, ago should still be paid from that age. This is in exact, accord with tho genoral theory of tho ponbiou law. In the matter of application for pension on account of disability, the pension payment is made from and after the time that the Usability arose. So iu this case the ago of sixt3-two is counted tho age of disability and, therefore, all should bo paid alike from that ago. To shut veterans off and eliminate a con siderable portion of the time which tho govornmont has accepted as tho proper period from which pensions should bo paid, seems a little liko sharp prac tice. If the veteran did uot keep his eye explicitly ou this mattor aud apply at tho first instance, he is deprived of somewhat of his rights. And thoso who mado toe early application so as lo cover the greatest extent of time, nro at an advantage as compared with Ihoso who were uot so alert, nor so swift to get in their applications. The Gov ernment, -howovor, in its laro-minded way of dealing with the peusioucrs, should not. tako advantage of small matters liko this, but should put all the veterans on an cnuality by paying to all alike the pension that is con sidered to be their due from and nftor tho ago of 6ixty-two. It equalizes in other details, aud why not in this 7 Wo suggest that tho member of Cou grcss in either branch who will first move to correct this inequality oud to accord to the veterans thoir fair nud equal rights under tho concession that tho ago of sixty-two is tho age of disa bility, will recoivo much praiso from thoso who survive of t he veterans of t.ho Union army, nud who desire nothing more than that all should be accorded just, and equal treatment.

Wo should therefore bo prepared to heed tho word of God's servants and prepare to ropcl theso enemies who. If left alone, will drive us from our homos. From sermon of Elder Joseph E. Cowley, a member of tho Cache stake high council, In tho Locnn Eighth ward mooting, August U0, 1008. Perhaps not so much so now as a few months ago, and yet occasion.") II3, tho Mormon church publicists have mado inquiry of Tho Tribune as to its molivo for publishing quotations from the prophetic sermons of oarby days. There has boon but ono object in this and that was to show what was tbo real sentiment stirring tho hearts of tho church leaders. For instance, wo ro centlj' printed an excerpt from a ser mon of President Uobcr C. Kimball, delivered in 1857, in which he asked: "How can you become impregnated with tho spirit and power of God, ex cept 3011 become impregnated through us?" If the church organ, or anj of its imitators, can point out tho differ ence botweou tho Kimball ' teaching of 1S57 and tho Cowley doctrine of 190S, Tho Tribnno may bo ablo to seo somo inconsistency in going back to tho early records, It should bo understood b- those persons who imagine that thc- ma pursuo in Utah a course in politics similar to that, to which the3' have been accustomed other States, and ex perience a fair deal, that thoy are deceiving themselves most grievous 13'. Tho3' cau not count upon politi cal fcalt3' in this State, because with the Mormou leaders the course to bo pursued is selected for no other pur pose than to "defeat the cncui3" and to perpetuato their own domina tion. No attention what over i paid to political priuciple, nor is any weight attached to faith to part- traditions, provided either shall stand iu tho way of their ambition. Impressing their followers with tho stupid idea that tho file leaders aro empowered to de liver tho "word of tho Lord" uuto all tho world, thoy utilizo the in lluenco thus procured to swa3' tho mass into tho desired action. A Gou lile. let us gay, may affiliate with oithor of the political divisious that arc pretended to bo maintained b3' the Mormou voters, and ho may become tho candidate of that party. Opposing him, on tho other ticket, ma3- bo a Mormou who is ruuuing for tho same office. The victory or' defeat of either would not at. all depend upon the strength or Ihe weakness of the party putting him forward it would all de pend upou tho "will of the Lord, as oxpressed through His authorized servants." Iu other words, tho result would fit the manner in which tho -people hod boon "impregnated" by the priesthood. There is nothing particularly now in Elder Cow1o3'h talk at Logan not. oven tho exposition of the fact that tho "division ou part3 lines" was a mere fako in tho iutcrost of tho Mor mon hierarchy but it is good to have tho testimony to that, effect from ouo i of the high priests themselves. Ema- I nating from that source it may have some offect upon Gentiles who fancy that, they arc proving Jo'il to thoir political parties while thoy aro merely i assisting to knife these organizations.

PUSHING TO ABSURDITY. Whenever there is any well-defined movement, such as the movement that has been in vogue for some 3ears in ( appoalint: to sentiment against the bright wings of birds on ladies' hats, or tho more rccont movement taken up by President Roosovolt in favor of tho conservation of the forests of tho coun try, there is alwaj's sure to be some ! body jump in and ntish the sentiment j to an absurd extreme. So far as wo have seen with respect j to this forest conservation proposition, I tho Rev. Robert S. McArthur, of Now ! York, is tho first to push tho proposi tion for tree preservation to absurd length. His idea is that by tho aboli tion of Christmas trees something could bo dono I53' wu3 of consorving the I forests of this countr.y. It must bo J admitted, however, as a practical prop osition, that the Christmas trco bus!- ' uess cuts a ver3 small figure in the mat ter of the preservation or destructlou of forests. And Mr. McArthur seems to forget the well-knowu fact that a great industr- has arisen simply for the purpose of providing these Christmas troes; this industry having nothing whatever to do with the forests in gen eral or with wanton destruction of the trocs of the country. These Christmas trocs are growu expressly for the pur pose of boing used for Christmas trees, and so far as his idea could possibly have an.y effect, it would bo siuiplj' for the destruction of that industry, and not in tho least for tho conservation of tho forests of the United States. Mr. McArthur considers tho Christ mas troo ono of tho customs of inauy takcu from the heathen. Il' so it '13 a voiy pleasant custom, aud one that ccr taiuly in heathendom did not in tho least tnid toward tho destructiou of tho forests; because in Europe, where tho Christian propaganda found that j henthon custom in full vogue, the whole country was covered with Jorcsts. And : cori.ainl3' if wo are to ohminato from tho Christian festivities, customs, aud observances, everything that might possibby be traced to heathen origin, wo would abolish many pleasant and heart-warming thiugs that now "teud ver- much to . the ameloriation of the bitter lot of. ma nj of tho human raco. Mr. McArthur in going to this extreme tends to throw ridicule upon the. whole matter of forest conservation. And in practical effect his banishment of the Christmas tree would chiefpy operate against au established industrv that provides thoset trocs, and would 03' just so far as his idea might reach lend to belittle tho whole forestation move mont. Mr. McArthur makes himself absurd, and puts tho whole mnttor of forestation ou such a narrow, shaky plane, that thone who are tho real friouds of genuine forstntiou must re grot his vagarj- und decline to stand on his platform.
