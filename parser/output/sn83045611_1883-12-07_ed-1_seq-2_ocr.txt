PCJT - INTtLUUKNOER. THK R\rißpm»* #f rommi So portiou of the President's message I will be received by the general public with more hearty approbation than his refert nee to the Mormon c|U**'.iou and recommendation wi h respect to the yovvrnment of I tab. These lo the wry bottom id' etf »irs. lie uriirs that under the existing system of territorial ; government and sofl.age it is "» <**» j ble to frame, adopt and ex<*c ;te an> liWS which are effective f sl.t.up out the abomination of p lygi . . .a- mar riages, aud. adopting the vi; v- < ; <,ov ; .Vlurmy in his lite rej-jrt to the S.cre- j tary of the Interior, recommends the i abolition of the preieut form of govern uieiit in L'tab by re eal of the law i»ro yiding for it, and that the people of that Territory l>e governed by a com mission appointed under a special law enacted for that purpose, which shall prescribe their duties, powers, etc. In a word, the President uas come to the conclusion that acute diseases require prompt and radical remedies, and that the present Mormon priesthood and membership are as litt.e entitled to ex ercise the privileges of franohise and enjoy the boon of self government as are the savages at the Sau Carlos agency lu Arizona. The whole country is (win* awakened to the fuct that there exists in the heart of this ureat country a living, growiuu cancer, winch, if not extirpated, will sooner or later reach the vitals of the Nation. If Congress, following the counsel of the President, should pass a law withdrawing from I tah its pn sent Territorial Government and in its stead , rovide as in the District of Columbia, Commissioners for its management, there would soon be a different stale of affairs in that territory. It would not be very long ere it woul l bo pissible to conviot and punish a man for a polyga mous marriage, and the priesthood who now defiantly flauut their ciim. s in the face of law and Courts, would sd in sackcloth and ashes, or l<e'.tt>r itill, be employed in breakiuK stone it (*>me prison of the country. Ihe F lumiids bill has not effected the hoped for re sult. It has been opposed per* stoutly by the Mormon priestho >.l aud its pro visions rendered nuj< itory by various methods. The reappointment of Gov. Murray, which it is aunouueed the President has decidad on, will empha size the recommendation in the mes sage and the enactment by (Jongrew of a law abolishing tie Territorial Gov ernment, supplemented by a Board of governing Commissioners with the Governor as Chairman, would tend to straighten out the tangles in the Mor mon question in short order. |UK 

POSTAL TKI W-HtrM. The President in his message dissents fi-oiu the rec miiuend ition of the Post muster General Unit the government as sume the *llllll control over the tele graph which it has always exercised over the mail. This might i>erha|»s have expected. Hut it strikes us that on a subject of so great importance, and in condemning a measure so strongly urged and demanded by the public, and whioh after thorough investigation had Iteeii recommended l»y oue of his i/abi net officers, the people were entitled to receive some better reasons than those given in the message. I'iie old objec tiou of competition with private enter prise is urged regardless of tlie fact that it is the duty always of the government to protect its people against extortion and outrage, and the further fact that the mail service of the present day is in dir«3t conflict with the business of expressage in one of its formerly licst paying departments, to wit: small par eels. The other objection is that it would add a large number of employees to the already numerous civil st rvioe list. This point is not well taken. I'u der proper regulations. honestly euforoed, the vital objection to a large oivil service list, i. e., the partisan power it gives and aids to perpetuate, falls to the ground. The employees of a government telegraph oiiuld be and should be as abselutely non partisan as soldiers and officers of the army and navy. That is to say. there should be as little partisan preforeuoe in their nppoiutment; they should be employed because of fitness exclusively, and should hold position either for definite terms of service or during good l>eha vior. They should be enlisted under stringent regulations, amply paid and placed nnder heavy penalties for viola tion of confidence or ueglect of duty. There are uo practical reasons why this plan would not snoceed. and its adop tion would knock the last peg from un der the worst monopoly of this genera tion. The tenderness shown a corpora tion whioh collects of the public an an nual tax five times as great a* necessary to pay fair dividends upon its actual cost and value, is most remarkable. Ihe ueeds o. the people seem to be ignored in the fear that goverun ent competition may reduoe the dividends of Jay Gould A Co. The President, while treating most subjects in his message with strength, haudles this matter much too gingerly to suit the general publie, and his expression of a belief, in con eluding his reference to the subject, that the government ought to exercise some sort of supervision over inter State telegraph communication will not satisfy .even someofhis l»est friends that his sympathy with public needs is all abeorbiug. After noting the proposal to erect a new home for the ('resident of the luited States, and to surrender the ex ecutive mansion to public bwuwis. a correspondent says: " Many people wunder why it costs s» much to keep the exeoutive mansion in order. Col. Itockwell says the wear aud tear of the furniture exceeds that of any hotel in the oouutry. The people, to the aver age of 508 a day. insist upon seeing the White House. They most tread uj-o» the carpets and rest tbemselvi s in the tempting chairs. 1 hey lunst exau-ine, with their eyes aud fingers, all the up holatery and drapery. When it is re membered that this is every day in the year, it will cease to be a mat ter of wonder that the wear is so rapid." A FtKE Pl'BUCkTloM.— Harfmr* )'«.«». / P*o]ilf. we mean.

A* kce« hi nr.* i wo reporter* of tbi« yesterday witnessed the same scene. and. unbe known to eieh other. both wrote it up Here are their different account* of it: Hk Had His Own Wa*.— Among the s»ll«rs who »b!pjfd on board the Cbai lenger. going to Ht 'a yesterday, was one noisy, boisterous fellow, who give a heap of trouble bef re he was g t on board. He ranted and tore aroun ♦. and made a free exhibition of him#-lf fo cjoite a tini*-. *nd finally, when in the boat, declared he wanted to j imp over board. Ca|»tain Thompson toid the inen to let him jump, which tbev did. when the fellow planned into tae bay. Once in he showed no intention of drewuiny. but swam about the U-st he was able. He took in considerable water, and when jus; about readv to drown wart hauled into the boat. with which he then gladly went to the ship If they had not let the fellow have his own way he'd have been unhappy to the end of the voyage, but now. on the con trsry, he will prababiy be one of the most tractable men on the ship. A Ijiu nkkn -Saiixjr. —A drunken sailor from the Challenger created some ex citement on Yesler'* wharf yesterday afternoon bv his wild and frantic ac tions. He was finally forced into a boat by his companions, and they started to pall for the ship. They had. however, takes bat a few strokes when the drnnktn madman threw himself into the water and swaiii as rapidly as possi ble away from the boat. Another boat put oat from shore to his assistance, but he fought furiously with the man who attempted to pull him from the water, lu tue mean time the tirst uoat bad caught up, and after a desperate struggle the fool was drawn luto it and forced to lie still on the bottom. He was then takeu out to the ship and forced on board after another struggle. Ihe man gave as the reason of his strange behavior that he wanted an other drink before going oil Istard, but the crowd which the disturbance col lected seemed to l»e prettv generally of the opinion that the best plan to pursu* in the case would hive been to allow the fellow to drown as quietly as jxissi ble.

The general ill lerests of Seattle and l acoma are the same. the trade of both is in the same articles—lumber, eoal, fish, hops, etc. I'hey are both railroad aud steamboat towns, on the same lines of travel, hav lug the same class of citizens, and in almost every rubied having identical interests. Aud yel no one will pretend to say that there is not a real aud 111 teuse antagonism between the two places, greater than anything of the sort betweeu Eastern and Western Washington. I'ortlaud and Aston a are two similar instances; also .Spokane and <'honey. Why, some places can hardl} endur* to be in the mini a county with other placts, though their interests are precisely the Same oil ivery but out). It may be supposed thft the in terests of the Sound country are the same, but arc they really so? Ihe lower Sound wants a pilot law, and at every legislative session c intends loudly for it. The middle and upper Sound do not want it. Is this a ground fur the division of the I'erritory 't We might go 011 ludeliuitelv reciting the local Sim ilarities and differenciS and local contentious aud strifes, but none of them would really furnish a single wor thy argument in favor of division—an argument that would l>e at all satisfac tory to the people of the Territory at large. The people of Washington want no division, but rather au extension takui < m North Idaho, as prayed for b> the inhabitants thereof. A MUKPKHKU AT LABOK.— There is a feeling throughout the Couuty that a greater effort should be made to capture Stone, the murderer of Hopkins, on thanksgiving day. A reward should be offered for him, dead or alive. It is now stated on pretty good authority that certain parties iu that vicinity aided aud abetted Stone in his murderous at tack on Hopkins. If such is the case, they should be arrested aud punished. This community cannot afford to lost its reputation for hunting out aud pun ishing villatus and murderers, and Stone aud his gang are good subjects to practice on. The offioers have lieen vigilant aud diligeut, but it would seem that a good detective should be set t<> work to get at the bottom facts ot thi* terrible erime in wbioii a good citizen was wronged, and then shot dowu iu his tracks by a man whose hands have heretofore been stained with human blood, if reports concerning him ar« true. Stone is a bad man, aud should t»e caught and hung, if uot by law. by the people, who are greater than tbe law. This same Stone was iudtct>>d at the last term of by the Grand Jury, for flourishing a revolver in an angry aud threatening manner, in a crowd, but the petit jury acquitted him, thus turning him l«Hise on the cum uiuuitv to shoot ami kill whenever his murderous temper prompted hi iu to do so, and the result has been as stated above. No patus or expense should l»- spared to capture this slayer of his fel low man. He is probably skulking alxuit in the vicinity of his murderous work, waiting an opportunity to cross the mountains into Kasteru Wash ingtou.

CIIIMICI'M VALLH. — Mr. K. S. llobiuson, one of tin* solid farmers of Paget Sound. made a pleanant call at our office yesterday. Mr. ltubinsoii in out) of the pioneers of the North Pacific, and served iu the Legislature in 1855 and iu IH.K;, with Arthur A. Denny, of this city, for wh mi Mr. Kobinsou voted for Speaker. Mr. Kobinsou took up it faim iu Chimicuiu Valley, Jefferson county, where he has since dwelt almost an ordinary lifetime. His business is dairying. H* raises two hundred tons of bay a year, keeps a hundred he id of cattle, aud makes a great quantity of choice butter, whioh finds ready sale any plaoe where offered at the market rates. The t'hiinicum Valley is a uardt'U spot of great excellence and ruucb f»eauty. In it are about twenty farms, the greater part of which are de voted to dairying. Upwards of 22,000 pounds of butter were made during the past reason, aud six or seven thousaud pouuds of cheese. More cheese would Have been made had it beeu possible to obtain the milk, but the farmers would not sell the milk, preferring to turn into butter as much of it as possible. Mutter has averaged then. 40 cents a pound this year, and has been in extri{ ordinary demand at tnat. The Iron ! works of the Puget Sound Company are located iu the Valley, from whioh the ore is obtained, it being bog ore. That heretofore obtained has contained too much sulphur to render its making into pigs profitable. In oonsequence the works have not been run all tUe time to their full capacity, and the product has been small to an extent quite disap pointing to thoae who had builded their uopes anou it. A better class of ore further down has since b©eu discovered, which itjis thought will insure continu ous operations during the r.ext two years and indefinitely thereafter. When fully eiuploved the par roll of the com pany amounts to $14,000 a month.

Orford reef daring the night of Oct. :>th, and in getting off again. she was beached in Port Orford, in an endeavor to save her. No lives were lost. It ■ieems a mystery how such an accident could happen on so tine a night. Cape i Blanoo is about eight miles north of ; Port O.ford. being the most western j |>oiut of land south of Cape Flattery, i From Cajie HI inoo extends the HI inco ] reef in a southwest direction about a j mile, then comes a channel abmt one j and one-half nul»M wide, and uext the j Orford reef, extending two or three;, miles in the s.wue direction as Hlanco | reef, so that its southernmost rock Fox | Rock' lies abont west of Fort Orford he id. and distaut about four and one half miles. Orford reef consists to sow? extent, of tall, isolated rocks IU the J shaj>e of j>eaks md arches, curious and picturesque in the extreme. Blanco reef is mostly low rocks, and mo>t of it slightly nuder water. As there is an ex cellent light ou Cape Blanco, and as the night W;LS clear and starry, it seems queer ho s such an accident could I happen. So wrote a correspondent, who wrote a day later Nov. HOth i *as follows: "The ship is under water from rift to about amidships. She has ap parently brok*in two amidships. She j had OH 1925 tons of coal and salmon.

Merchant it Co.'s candy factory yesterday and was muab surprised at what he saw. He found no less than six girls and three boys, under the di rection of a foreman, busily at work there, making aud putting up candy as fast as they ceald drive. The reporter had previously supposed that the candy makers in that establishment numbered one, and was considerably taken back to find ten instead. These ten persons turn out mo e CMudy in a day than the average reader would believe was sold on all Puget Sound. All that they make is quickly disposed of, though, as he who frequently passes Wy the store aad sees the active trade going on, will readily believe.
