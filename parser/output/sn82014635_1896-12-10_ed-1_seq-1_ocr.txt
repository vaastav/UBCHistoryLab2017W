MADE SPECIAL ORDER FOLLOWS THE IMMIGBATION BILL 15 THE SENATE, WHICH BILL HAS BEEN TAKEN UP DINGLEY BILL GALLED UP ALLEN OF NEBEASKA. BY Taken up a Tote of 35 to 21 Motion to Re commit Pending Red-Hot Cuban Keso tions Bills and Committees. "Washington, D. C,""Dec 9. The senate today, by the decisive vote of 35 to 21, adopted a motion to take up the Dingley tariff trill. Unexpected and surprising as this action" -was, it did not have the significance which the vote itself appears to convey. Immediately following: it, Mr. Aldrich, of Rhode Island, one of the Republican members of the finance committee, mov d to recommit the bill to that commit tee, and this motion was pending when, at 2 o'clock, the morning hour expired, and the entire matter lapsed, as though no vote had been taken. Neither the bill Dor -the motion to Recommit will enjoy any privilege or precedence as a result af the action today. It showed, how ever, some lively parliamentary fencing between Mr. Allen (Pop. Neb.,) the au thor or the motion, and Messrs Chandler, Hale and Aldrich, as well as for an ex position of the uncertain and shifting elements within the senate when a vote Is precipitated on an important public question. The debate was at times sharp and personal, Mr. Allen is very fluent In his expressions, and he taunted the Republicans for shrinking from the Din gley bill after conducting a tariff cam paign. "It -has gone out from the powers that be. In the Republican party," said Mr. Allen, "that with the incoming adminis tration we are to have an extraordinary session of congress for the purpose of restoring the tariff laws." Thus Mr Allen went on, touching many points that have hitherto been reserved for caucus consideration. Mr. Chandler reminded Mr. Allen that not only had tariff won, but free silver had lost in the recent election, and he urged Mr. Allen to aid in a genuine et fort to execute the will of the people. Mr. Hale took occasion to state with frankness that the Republican senators expected an actual majority in the next senate. -which would make tariff legisla tion more easy of accomplishment than It is now. Mr. Aldrich's first move -was to ask to have the bill referred back to the finance committee with-instructians to strike out the silver amendment but he later accept ed the suggestion of Mr. Harris to omit the Instructions. It was in this form that the question to recommit was pend lng when, at 2 o'clock the debate was! cut off. Early in the day three sets of vigorous resolutions for Cuban independence fur nished an interesting feature. They came from Mr. Cameron of Pennsylvania Mr. Mills of Texas and Mr. Call of Flori da and, while differing in terms, breathe the same spirit, the recognition by the United States of Cuban independence. SENATE PROCEEDrXGS Day's Doings in the Upper House Set JTortb. in Detail. Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. Mr. Frye, (Rep. Me.,) president pro tern of the sen ate, occupied the chair today in the ab-stn'-e of the vice president The prayer of Rev. Dr. Milburn made eloquent ref erence to the late Charles S. Crisp, of Georgia, a "man faithful and loyal In all his relations, an admirable presiding office, an earnest and faithful servant of the people; my his name be graven on the tablet of the nation's memory." Mr. Piatt (Rep. Conn.) presented the re port of the joint select committee of con gress relathe to the question of alcohol used in the arts, etc, and offered a reso lution for a continuance of the commit tee. 

CAMERON BEGINS IT. This cleared the way for a series of vigorous 'Cuban resolutions. Senator Cameron (Rep. Pa.) first In troduced the following: "Resolved, by the senate and house of representatives. That the independence of the republic of Cuba be and the same is hereby acknowledged by the United States. "Resolved, That the United States fchould use its friendly offices with the government of Spain to bring to a close the war between Spain and Cuba." Mr. Mill (Dem. Tex.) followed the Cameron resolution at once with the fol lowing resolution: "Resolved, That the president of the United States is hereby directed to take possession of the Island of Cuba with the military and naval forces of the United States, and and hold the same until the people of Cuba can organize a govern ment deriving its powers from the con tent of the governer and arm and equip such military and naval forces as may be necessary to secure them against for eign invaior..." The Mills resolution was referred to the foreign resolutions committee. Mr. Call (Dem. Fla.) followed Cam eron and Mills with another joint reso lut.on, as follows: "Resolved, by the senate and house of representatives, That tne United States of America recognize the Republic of Cuba as a fre T.d Independent govern ment, in the ports and within the juris diction of the United States." The Call resolution went to the table. Mr. Call announcing that he would speak on it at an early day. Tne three Cuban resolutions came in quick succession, each being read m full, and occasioned marked attention, owing to the direct ness and vigor of the language used by the three senators. 

MISCHL.I.ONEOUS .MEASURES. After this came a flood- of bills cover ing every phase of legislation including , an anti-trust bill and a measure fo with draw small notes from circulation, by Mr Snoup, and for "th temporary reduc tion of salaries of United Statesofficerss" f? by Jtfr. Chandler Tie resolution lor the continuance of tie Joint committee inquiring into the qiiiBtlon of alcohol used In the arts, was "Mr. CMorrill (Rep. Vt.) offered a reso tttftsst, evidently directed against the use af Jheaew congressional library for the '.Mat- Iss&ugural, as has been proposed . Th resolution recites that the public -f Wrir shall not be used for any other VpaapM than for library purposes. The reMfitfwa was referred. " atrMAllen (Pop. Neb.) offered a reso lution reciting that it is the settled doc trice that no state has the power to af- fect the integrity of contracts by legis lation or otherwise. Mr. Chandler (Rep. X. H.) secured the adoption -without comment, of sweeping resolution directing the committee on In terstate commerce to inquire into and Prevent combinations by the Joint Traf- . fie association, composed of the railroads of the country: also the. reported combl- iimuu ui. uie nuur ana mining interests of the country, also the reported combi nation of the window glass interests. FREE HOMES BILL. The bill providing free homestead of public lands in Oklahoma -territory for actual and bona fide settlers and re serving the public lands for that purpose was made a special order to follow the immigration bill. The calendar was then taken up, the first Ibill being one appropriating 160,000 to the representatives of Erskine S. Al len for an invention in breech-loading guns. The bill was passed. THE DINGLEY EIKL. At this point Mr. Alien (Pop., Neb.) made an unexpected move by proposing to take up the Dingley tariff bill, with its pending .free silver substitute. Mr. Al len first asked unanimous consent that the bill be taken up, and on Mr. Aldrich's objection, Mr. Allen moved to take up the bill. There was much commotion at the unexpected appearance of the ques tion and- pages hurried for the leaders of the various elements. Mr. Piatt gained time by having the bill read in full. After a whispered conference between Messrs. Piatt and Aldrich, the latter withdrew his objection to taking up the bill. "I renew it, and object," interposed Mr. Palmer. "Then I move to take up the bill," said Mr. Allen with emphasis. This precipitated a roll call, the ques tion being. Shall the Dingley tariff bill, with its silver substitute, be taken up? The roll call proceeded amid the closest attention and interest. It resulted as follows: TEAS. Republicans Aldrich, Cameron, Chan dler, Clark, Davis, Elklns, Frye, Gal linger, Gear, Hale, Hansbrough, Hoar, Lodge, McMillan. Mitchell (Ore.), Mor rill, Nelson, Perkins, Piatt, Pritchard, Quay, Sherman and Wolcott Democrats Gordon, Morgan, Murphy, Prgh, Roach, Smith.

Democrats Blackburn, Blanchard, Daniel, Faulkner, Gibson, Gorman, Har ris, Hill, Jones (Ark.), Martin, Mills, Palmer, Pascoe, Turpie, "Vest and "Walt hall 16. Independents Cannon, DuBois, Man tle 3. Total 21. The announcement of the vote was no less a surprise than Mr. Allen's first move. MOTION TO RE-COMMIT. Mr. Aldirch quickly interposed a mo tion to refer the bill to the committee on finance, with instructions to report back the bill without the free silver amend ment. This brought Mr. Allen to his feet in an energetic protest He said the Re publican party had prevailed at the re cent ejection and were now looking for ward to effecting tariff legislation. Throughout the campaign they had promised the people tariff legislation. Why, therefore, should they hesitate now? The Nebraska senator declared that the senators across the aisle did not want to take up the tariff question at all. Mr. Chandler responded, suggesting that the recent election had not only brought forward the tariff question but had retired the silver question, so far as Independent action by the United States alone was concerned. He asked there fore, whether Mr. Allen was ready in good faith to take up the Dingley bill and free it from the silver amendment Mr. Allen replied that the silver ques tion was far from settled by the recent election. Six million votes had been reg istered for silver. So far as the tariff was ccaUtfrned, he wanted the Republican to "get into the saddle." Mr. Allen declar ed that the Republicans had abandoned the Dingley bill. "Nothing of the kind," remarked Mr. Gallinger. "It Is so announced in Republican newspapers today," declared Mr. Allen. "Let me ask the senator," interrupted Mr. Chandler, "if he is so anxious about tariff legislation, will he aid to rid this bill of the silver amendment so that the original tariff measure can be acted up on?" "I will act in my own way," respond ed Mr. Allen, "without bowing my neck to the Republican yoke." Mr. Aldrich and Mr. Allen indulged in a further colloquy, the former endeavor ing to secure a time for a final vote. He wanted a time fixed now or here after, but Mr. Allen declared that it was futile to talk of a vote now. when the Republican senators had no idea of pass ing on the Dingley bill in its original form. Mr. Hale 'came into.the debate with .an inquiry of Mr. Allen as to whether it was proper to proceed to tariff legislation now, when the Republican senators ex pected to have a clear majority in the next senate, capable of effectively con ducting the debate. "Where will you get that majority?" inquired Mr. Allen amid laughter. "I said 'expect, " answered Mr. Hale. He went on to say that it was manifest that the Republican party felt they were not in the position now that they expect ed to be in the next congress and that It was manifest from this condition that more effective action could .come later. ALDRICH MOTION AMENDED. Mr. Harris (Dem.. Tenn.) moved to amend the Aldrich motion by omitting the instructions, which was accepted. At this point the morning hour, which lasts until 2 o'clock, expired, and the heated controversy went over. This leaves pending the motion to refer the Dingley bill to the finance committee, but the motion has no privilege giving it preference tomorrow. Efforts to secure an adjournment and an executive session were successfully resisted by Mr. Lodge, who succeeded in having the immigration bill taken up. He yielded, however, to a personal re quest from Mr. Gibson (Dem., Md.) for time to look into the bill .and then, at 2:20, the senate went Into executive ses sion and soon after adjourned. WHY ALLEN DID SO. Washington, Dec 9. When asked to explain the motive of his motion in the senate today to take up the Dingley tariff bilU Senator Allen replied: "I had no mot've except, as we used to sav in the army, to feel the enemy. I wanted to satisfy myself and the coun try as to the atttitude of the Republi cans towards this measure, whicn thy have professed to be so anxious to have become a law. and I think I have at least succeeded in demonstrating that they have no intention of trying to do anything." SENATE BILLS INTRODUCED. Washington, Dec 9. Senator Chandler today introduced a bill In the senate for a" ten per cent reduction of the salaries of all federal employes. The reduction shall begin on the soth of June, 1S3T. and continue for three years and shall In clude all officers and employes of the Unted States whose salaries are paid from the treasury, cither annually, quar terly, monthly or semi-monthly, except those whose compensation cannot de di minished during- their continuance in of fice.

Cubans Driven From the Field Spaniards Retire, Robbing: the Dead on the Field, Funding Pretty Good Picking on the Two - liodles In Question How the Absence of tlie Corpses Is Accounted for Major Cirnjeda's Two Stories About What Be came of Them What Cubans Every where Say About the Story. (Copyrighted 1S95 by the Associated Press.) Havana, Cuba,. Dec. 0. The confident claims of the Spanish officials that they have abundant proof of the death of Antonio Maceo and his young aide, Fran cisco Gomez, son of Maximo Gomez, con tinue without abatement'The details an nounced' today, however, of the facts re lied upon for the identification of the two Cubans, have caused an undercur rent of doubt in this city. Major Cirujeda, who commanded the Spanish forces in the engagement at Punta Brava on Monday, and whose troops discovered the two bodies and gave the evidence of identification, con sented to be interviewed on the circum stances of the case. He said today to the correspondent of the Associated Press that when the rebels were routed it was evident that the body of the chief was abandoned on the field. The Span ish column, without stopping to explore the field, went in hot pursuit of the In surgent and followed them for a mile or more. Meantime young Gomez is sup posed to have committed suicide by Ma ceo's side. ROBBING THE DEAD. While the troops were returning to Guato, after the pursuit had ceased, va rious guerillas belonging to Major Clr ujeda's command went over the field where the rout of the insurgents had oc curred and searched the bodies remain ing there for anything of importance. "The body of Maceo," Major Cirujeda continued, "was relieved of a ring, cloth ing, etc. The gueriallas who performed the act were at the time quite unaware that the body was that of Maceo. In fact, little attention was paid to the iden tity of the bodies. It was already dark on the field, and it was raining. "Various other bodies were also serched." It was an adjutant, according to Ma jor Cirujeda's further statement, who insisted that the above mentioned body and the other, which was lying by its side, were evidently of the first rate im portance and that they must not thus be left without identification. DRAGGED AT HORSES' TAILS. "The two bodies were therefore tied by the feet to the tails of some horses," said the major, "and thus dragged over the ground, the intention being to carry them to town for identification. But after proceeding for a while the horses became tired with their burden and the bodies were therefore cut loose and left in the road." When the troops reached Guato, Ma por Cirujeda proceeded to read the docu ments which had been found upon the bodies and which were described in a dispatch exclusively to the Associated Press yesterday. They included a letter addressed to "Dear Pancho," and sign ed "Gomez," a diary of Maceo's opera tions from Nov. 28 to Dec. 7, and a note. In pencil found on the body of the young er man, saying he died rather than aban don the body of his general, Maceo. The undershirt and socks on the body of the older man were marked with the initials "A. M.," and a ring on the fin ger contained the engraved inscription "Antonio Y. Maria." CAN'T PRODUCE THE BODIES. After reading these documents. Major Cirujeda says he became convinced that the bodies which the troops had aban doned were those of Antonio Maceo and young Gomez. But, it was then too late to return and recover them. Major Cir ujeda, however, expresses the firm con viction that they were those of Maceo and Gomez's son. With the insurgents in the battle, Ma jor Cirujeda says, was a beautiful Ama zon about 22 years of age, who urged the rebels "a 14 Machete," but at the same time interposed to protect the prisoners. Major Cirujeda has taken charge of the objects found on the body said to be of Maceo, for the further examination. There w ere a gold wath, a splendid pair of cuff buttons made by Moreau Torln, Paris, with live pointed stars on them and, inclosed in a big strapped leather case, a hunting 'nife with an obony han dle and gold mounted, and a good water proof coat All of these were taken from the body of the scout, Santa. Ana. It is thus seen that there has been no actual identification of the bodies them selves, the conviction as to the identity resting upon the evidence of documents and articles found upon them. There is no doubt, however, of the assurance of the general public here that Maceo is dead. It is pointed out that he met his death in a similar manner to that of Jose Marti and Zayas. HI loss is regarded as the heaviest blow the revolution has received and it is felt that his continued life was all that could save the insur gent movement. He was the most strik ing person of the revolution. CIRUJEDA'S OTHER STORY. Major Cirujeda telegraphed to head quarters yesterday that after the battle at Punta Brava he had been obliged to abandon the bodies which, in the course of a recolnnasance, his troops had dis covered to be the bodies of Maceo and Frarcisco Gomez. The guide of column said that the bod looked like that of Maceo. Some one standing by observ ed that Maceo was in Pinar del Rio, but it Is nevertheless believed that the bodies are thos-- of the Cuban leaders. The bugler of the battalion of San Quentln was taking a ring away from the fal len Cuban. When he found him he was still alive. He thereupon killed him with a machete. BODY RECAPTURED. The insurgents, upon noting the smal! force of tne i econnoitering party, rushed in with a large number of troops and succeded In carrying away the body said to be Maceo's, bu- without securing any of the jewelry or papers which had been found upon it. Major Cirujeda, in order not to aban don his dead and wounded, was compell ed .o retreat to Punta Brava. At Punta Brava the soldiers delivered the jewels and documents which they found with the two bodies and then the chief of the column became convinced of the death o' Maceo. YOUNG GOMEZ'S LETTER. Fe'lowing is a copy of the letetr, writ ten in pencil, which was found on the body of the youta suposed to bo Francis co Gomez: "Dear mamma, papa, dear brothers: I die at my post I did not want to abandon the body of General Maceo, and I stayed with him. I was wounded in two places and as I did not fall into the hands of the enemy, I. have kUed my self. I nm dying. I die pleased at be ing In the defense of the Cuban cause. 1 wait for you in the other world. 'Your son, "FRANCISCO GOMEZ.

CAME AD TfENt Truth of the Matter or His Boh Daad llne In Fiuar del Bio. New Orleans, La., Dec. 9. The Pica yune's correspondent sends the follow ing: "Havana, Dec. 3. The all-absorbing questions now in this city, I might say on the island, are the "Weyler campaign and the action of congress. It has been pretty well understood that the president will not do anything towards changing his policy, but the action of the Ameri can congress is what perturbs the minds of the Spanish political leaders. "I was present on the return of Gen eral Weyler and can really say that he did not look like a conquering, hero, by any means. He seemed more like one who is glad to return; aye, he was with out doubt very glad, after the decidedly bad reception given by Maceo and his friends. "The return of Weyler to Havana as hurriedly as he left, had only one object, namely, the rumor that Gomez was al ready in Santa Clara and was pushing on to Havana. From authority which I consider of the greatest veracity, and vhose Intimacy with the government I have no doubt whatever of, I can safely say that two powerful, reasons have compelled Weyler to return : "First, his defeat at the handsief Ma ceo in the battle of Rubl, and, iecond, the fear of Gomez's approach, "jja you are probably aware. General Ifcyler's divisions wore caught by .tfcI wily guerilla chief in the midst of a cross fire from the crest of two hills, and At the same time his cavalry Attacked the flanks and rear of the Spanishrarmy, forcing him to suspend the forward at tack in order to concentrate his forces in repelling the attack on his flanks and rear. "The mines which Maceo had placed on the mule paths leading to the crests of the hills were quickly set in motion and many a Spanish mother will etern ally wear "weeds for her son 'that never came back.' "General Weyler himself tried to urge his men forward, gut to no purpose, and he was forced to order a retreat to Can 'delaria, where the column was, once again organized. The artillery officers of the columns, with the exception of a few men, were either killed or badly wound ed. From one of the Spanish officers who 'was with Weyler I learned that ,he left S00 wounded soldiers in Artemesia. "The day Weyler arrived in Havana he sent a long dispatch to Madrid recit ing his many victories. On that same night, accompanied by an American newsppper correspondent," I counted 500 wounded soldiers who reached Havana Ty train- and on a man-of-war .oitrans Port" ( ,-Wl. DE 

LOME GETS CONFIRMATION ZZ3 From Madrid, Whore they Probably Know all About it. Washington, D. C, Dec 9. Senor De Lome, the Spanish minister, received a cable dispatch from Havana last night which seems to bear out the press re port of the death of Antonio Maceo and oung Gomez. Owing to the fact that the cable was sent last night before the press reports, it is lacking In many of the details of the latter. It says in sub stance, that after the engagement near Mariel on Monday two bodies were found on the field which, from their clothing and papers found upon them are taken to be those of Maceo and his young com panion. Senor De Lome declined to discuss the probability of the report but expected fresh advices from the government of Havana. Senor De Lome today received the fol lowing cablegram from Madrid, from the duke of Tetuan, minister of state of Spain: "Confirm officially the death of Leader Antonio Maceo, in the glorious battle of cur troops, and also the suicide of the son of Maximo Gomez." Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. The follow ing diifcuch, in detail confirmatory of his previous advices, was received today by Minister De Lome, from the Spanish minister of foreign affairs: "The insurgent leader, Antonio Maceo, realizing the impossibility of remaining in Pinar del Rio province, and being con srantly pursued by Spanish columns, crossed the trocha on the 4th Instant He was at the head of over 2.000 men whom he had recruited from the local bands of the western n'art of the pro vince of Havana, when he was overtaken by Major Cirujeda's column, 350 strong. Maceo'c forces were routed, the leader being killed in the engagement, andthe son of Maximo Gomez committing sui cide after being wounded. The corpses have been identified and their clothing arms and documents found In their po session were taken by the Spaniards. The remainder of the band have dis persed in consequence of this brilliant victory of our troops." SPANIARDS PRUTEXD TO BELIEVE FT There is no End of Rejolclnc Over Maceo's Reported Death. Madrid, Dec 9. Senor Canovaa Del Castillo expresses the belief that the death of Maceo will effect a change In the campaign in Cuba. Other politicians estimate that the rebellion will be sup pressed by spring. The Imparclal notes the coincidence of the success of the Spanish armies in Cu ba, and the declaration of Impotence which President Cleveland ascribes to Spain. Similar articles appear in special addi tions of other papers and there is great enthusiasm in other circles over the news of Maceo's death. Patriotic groups con tinue to parade the streets, bearing flags and making demonstrations before the nfw.spaper offices. A delegation paid a -visit tc the war office and expressed to General Ascarrada the popular admira tion for the army.

San Francisco, Call, Dec. ?. The legal contest between Sharkey and Fitzsim mons for the possession of the 510.000 purse, has commenced before the super ior court. Excitement was intense when the pro ceedings began in the crowded court room and Manager Julian brought out his witnesses to prove the conspiracy which, he stated, had deprived Fitzsim mons of the purse. "Australian Billy" Smith, one of Shar key's trainers, was the first witness. He detailed his work in connection with pre paring Sharkey for the ring and said that when the question of selecting a ref eree was mooted in Sharkey'd training quarters he was asked to suggest a ref eree. Witness suggested Hiram Cook and said that Lynch then asked him if he knew Cook -well enough "to talk busi ness with him." Afterwards witness said that Lynch caracterized Cook as "no good" because he would not favor his own brother in a fight On the even ing of the fight Sharkey told witness that Earp bad been "fixed" as referee and that "Earp was all right." Witness described the uproar over the prelimi naries to the fight and said that when Fitzsimmons objected, to the. bandages on Sharkey's hand, Earp went over to Sharkey's corner and said: "Take off those cloths, it will be all right ayway." Witness said that when Sharkey re ceived the knock-out blow on the jaw in the eighth round Lynch said to Shar key. "Lie low; hold your hands on your groin and pretend to faint with pain." Sharkey was then carried to a roqm. He did not appear to be hurt Witness said that Allen, another trainer, "removed Sharkey's bandages and did the work which caused the swelling. Sharkey was then driven to his hotel in a hack. Allen was with him. Sharkey was all right" George Allen, another of Sharkey's trainers, corroborated the story of the previous witness, adldng that several physicians were refused admittance when Sharkey was undergoing the oper ation with Which Allen produced the evi dence of a foul. Lynch said no doctor should come into the Toom and interfere with his plans. Witness said Sharkey told him that the National Athletic club was composed of Groom, Gibbs, Lynch and Sharkey, and that Sharkey was to receive 20 per cent of the proceeds or. the fight after the purse was deducted. Sharkey said that his three partners in the National club were broke and Shar key had to advance $2,500 for prelimi nary expenses, which had left the sailer pugilist stranded financially. Witness said that a few days before the fight Sharkey told him he thought Earp would be the right kind of a refer ee for him and. added that it would be wOTth-42,5to to .Earp if he were the right kind of a referee. TWO SIDES TO EVERT STORY Charge of Consplercy Went With a Coua ter.Charge of Perjury. San Francisco, Call.. Dec 9. Dan J. Lynch, Sharkey's manager and backer, made the following statement tonight to the Associated Press: "Mr. Sharkey desires all his friends-, and especially those In the east, to sus pend judgment on the story told today in court by Australian Billy Smith, until Sharkey can be heard on the stand. The fac- of the matter is that Smith perjured himself and we will prosecute him for perjury when the present trial is over. His statement is a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end, and it Is very clear to me that he has been bought by the Fitzsimmons crowd to give testi mony damaging to Sharkey's case. Smith demanded $1,000 after the fight for four weeks' assistance as trainer. Shar keyrefused to give more than $400. This is tne animus of his testimony in court today." HOW IT WAS 

DISCOVERED There is Trouble Over the Swag and One of the Gang Peaches. San Francisco, Dec 9. A morning pa per publishes the following: George Allen, one of the men who train ed Tom Sharkey for his fight with Fitz simmons, has made a confession to the effect that Fitzsimmons was deprived of his victory through a conspiracy. The trainer and the Sharkey management have quarrelled over money matters, it is said, and in the heat of the moment Allen made threats of what he would do if he was not paid for his services. Attor ney Kowalsky. representing Fitzsim mons, heard of the circumstances and he employed private detectives to gather in the Irate trainer. He was run to ground -yesterday and induced to tell the whole story. WITH NEVER A CltOSS WORD Corbettand Ills Little Wife are Models or Conjugal Sweetness Xew York, Dec 9. James J.

The Iron Mountain. fast express train, out-going, was held up one mile from the Union station, within the city limits, tonisht at 9:3$, by six masked men. The door of the ex press car was blown off with dynamlto but no plunder was secured. One of the men etopd in the center of the track, and waved a red lantern, sig nifying that danger was ahecd. Tne en gineer stopped the trainr and. no sooner had he done so than two masked ma jumped on the engine cab and, present ing revolver-, told him to hold the en gine still, on pain of death. Twa of the other robbers made for the expreat car. while the remaining two stood guard outside. In less than fifteen mlnutsa tho whole thing was over and the conductor hastened to the nearest telepnone and notified the police. As soon as the matter was reported at the central station every detective on hand was called into service an I. urder instructions from Chief of Detective- Desmond, sent out on the case The conductor telephoned in n description uf the men as near as he could, but owing to th fact that they all were masked it was but meagre. "Word was sent to every police officer on duty in the city to be on the lookout for smpleuous characters. Officera on duty were called in and tent out to search every tough resort in the city where thieves are known to hang out The robbers had planned well the job, for within two minute after, they had disappeared from view and were lost in the crowds of the city. For boldness th robbery has no equal in the annals of train hold-ups In Missouri. It It believed by the police that the three men who re cently entered the office of the Homo Krewing company in broad day and bound and gagged the otTlce employe and got away with $1,000 were leaders in thiT job. Two robbers went to the- ex press car and demanded admittance Express Messenger "VV. J. Egan Tefued to let them in. They threatened to kill him if he did not. but h remonstrate that the express safe could not b open ed. It was fortunately a through car, and the money was in n time-lock af. Finding It useless to try to blow thN open the robbers jumped off and notified their companions on the engine that Jhey hadf failed to get uiythlng. Con ductor William Jlall came forward to find out what was the matter. He wan met by one of the thieves, who, pointing a revolver at his head, ordered him back on the train. The robbers then left and Engineer William Greene started on. At Jefferson Barracks Exprcas Mwi cnger Egan said the Pacific Express company had lost nothing. "Had it been a local instead of A through train," he eald, "they mlghs have secured come booty, but thi through cars always carry burglar proof, time-lock safes." The plac where he robbery occurred was at the Bates street crossing, wheni there is a deep cut The passengers on the train were in no way disturbed and it was half an hour before any one real ized what had happened. As the train pulled away Express Messenger Egan cam to th shattered door of his car. intending to nhoot at tho bandits. No sooner did thry see him. however, than they op'd fire, and h fled behind pile of boxe. The noise of the shooting attracts! the cierJu In th.9 mail car and tticy openAl the door and a fusllnde followed. At midnight th police had made no arestsi The only cifw tfwy could gt was from a citizen residing nar Bat ve nu crossing, where the hold-up occur red.
