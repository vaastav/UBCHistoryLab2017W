Washington, D.- C., Dec. 6.—For the f i-st time in eighteen years the Democratic ) irty has possession and control of the ]! ouse of Representatives, but the organiza tionofthenew House moved remarkably fc.uwly and it was after 4 o'clock before the Question of who were entitled to seats had I • en settled; objection was made to swear i'.ig In of Mr. Morey, of Louisiana and Mr. II node, of Virginia. There was as usual a good deal of exette j.-.ent previous to and attending the organ!, nation of the House. As early as 10 o'elvck an immense crowd Ji.id assembled In the hall of the House. The approaches to the galleries were so packed tliat it was impossible to approach l lie doors. Such an bverturning in politics as took place at the last Congressional elections na i rally brought tegfifher an unusually large ) umber of new faces. Persons who have t tended the meetings of the last two or Hi roe years naturally missed the faces of iuch prominent members as Butler, E.R. jioar and Buffington, of Mass., Potter, of C,uw Jersey, Archer, of Marylond, Scofield aud Albright , of Pennsylvania, Niblack, •if Indiana, Beck, of Kentucky and many 0 hers. As the hands of the clock pointed to the Lour of 18, Mr. McPherson called the House t o order, and it was with some difficulty 1 he House could be cleared of the crowd that had no business there. roll call \ Developed the presence of an unusually Large number of Representatives. It did not require much time to elect Mr. Kerr Speaker, and as he was escorted to the chair by Messrs. Blaine and Randall, he ■was greeted with loud applause. The swearing in of members was then proceeded with the exception as above -Mo* .■business. After Mr. Morey had been sworn in, the Objection to Mr. Goode of Virginia was not pressed, and he was also sworn in aud took Lis seat. This much having been accomplished, it was now half past lour o'clock,and in order -to facilitate matters, a resolution was of i'crcJ aud adopted, declaring flie caucus nominees for Clerk and other officers to be the officers of the House of the .Forty-fourth Congress. The usual committee was appointed to notify the President and the Senate that tbe organization of the House was complete and WPS ready to proceed to business. The late at which the organization was effected •evented the reading of the President's .Message. nour 1" 

TIIE SENATE ADJOURNS. The Sena* a adjeur'ied at an early hour :.nd then a large number of Senators moved to the Hall of tho House and wit over i essed the proceedings there. THE NEW SPEAKER. For a new band at the business Mr. Kerr handled the House very well and kept it in ,-aod order all day;, indicating that aa time wears on h? will make au efficient Mr. Kerr's voice is not as strong Speaker. as that *f his predecessors, Blaine or Colfax but nevertheless he speaks loud enough to be well heard, and lias a determined manner about him which shows tbat be is not to be Mr. Kerr does trifled with In any manner, not expect to announce his committees for . ome iny indication of how they shall be consti tuted, till he is prepared to annoucethem. days yet, nor docs he propose to give The Senate. There was nothing of importance done in The funeral emblems which arranged for the funeral ceremonies of the Senate. ,cre Vice President Wilson still remained in place. The desks of Senators Cameron, and Howe, of Wisconsin; Brace, of Mississippi; Dawes, of Massachusetts, and that former ly occupied by Mr. Ferry, of Michigan,were h decorated with a bouquet from admir. tag friends. Promptly at 12 o'clock, lion. T W. Ferry, of Michigan, president, p.o ■tempore, called the Senate to order nnd the Chaplain, Rev. Dr. Sunderland of 'ered prayer as follows :— Almighty and Everlasting God, we adore Thee as tbe Supreme Being. May we trust iu Thee as our Father in Heaven, the author As wc come into this • a ■ •of every blessing, dace yet dark with tlie shadow of national bereavement; as Thy servants assembled who were with together here, and some them last shall come no more, keep us to t-ealize the truth that we too, ire mortal, that our days are swift as arrows, that our work will quickly cease, that the sunset will to know it. O Lord 'io upon us ere we come -mi - God, wothauk Thee for Tby kindness yhown to these Thy servants In tbat Thou Daa brought them together here from many distant points in health and safety.

Deo. 6th.—The opening up of the old question in the House to-day, as to who was the Governor of Louisiana, and had the right to issue credentials to members elect, occurred in the caste of Mr. Morey, whose scat was contested.

Both of these gentlemen, he 6ald, held certificates Irons both W. P. Kellogg and John McRnry, aficT he was opposed to giving either nt^n a seat until a committee decided the question. The matter yliclted a general discussion, in which their was considers hie of the acri mony of political cross-firing displayed. Mr. Blaine was the chief ia the arena upon the Republican side, whose appeal apee upon the floor, after being so long intjie chair, seemed strange, claimed that Kellogg had been recognized as the Governor,of Loulsi by all the Departments of the ment, and upon that day, a me mbr.-r from that Slate named N^eh, had been sworn in with certificates ftfim Kellogg. It was not the -purpose now to raise the questiou as to who-was the Governor of Louisiana, but who whs enti tled to tlie scat. Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi, thought the only question before tin- House was as the Prima facie right, and the clerk had made a Prima facie case, When be placed the name on the roll fis he had a right to do. The Prima facie case mush be determined first and then the permanent membership. The yeas any nays 'were ordered by Mr. Wheeler, of New York, on ordering the main question, and such being demanded, the following was the result : Yeas 135, nays 134. Several Democrats near the foot of the roll call voting no, and indicating a sudden change of policy on that side, j Mr, WopdJ# , motion waa - the* I rejected without division, and on motion of Mr. r Blaine, Mr. Morey was sworn in.
