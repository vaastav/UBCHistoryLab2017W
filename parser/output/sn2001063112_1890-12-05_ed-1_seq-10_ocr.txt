PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Harrison Hakes Suggestions and Re ports to Congress on Subjects of National Interest Business of the Yarlous Government Offices Shown to Be Rapidly Growing. A Small Snrplns Figured Out for the Coming Tear Under the New Tariff Law. Fostering of Trade Relations With Sonth America Advised—Needed Legislation.- Ha Opposes Government Control of Telegraphs, But Favors a Lim ited Postal Service.' SWvi "Wabhington, Dec. 1.—The second session of the Fifty-first congress assem bled at noon. Unusual bustle and ac tivity was observable at the liouw and in the corridors of the Capitdl£tit an early hour, «s a result of the piVpara tiona for the opening day. In the house there were Beveral new members, sworn in, and some other preliminary business attended to before the appointment of the usual committee to wait on the pres ident to notify him that congress was ready to do business. The senate met at noon and appointed a committee to act with the house com mittee in notifying the president that congress was ready to receive any com munication he might be pleased to make. The senate took a recess until 1:30 p. m. Shortly after reassembling the presi dent's message was received and read as followss: To the Senate and House of Represent atives: The reports of the several executive departments which will be laid before congress in the usnal course will exhibit in detail the operations of the govern ment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents and results, and chiefly such as may be the founda tion of the recommendations I shall sub mit will be referred to in this annual message. The vast and increasing business of the government has been transacted by the several departments during the year with faithfulness, energy and success. The revenues, amounting to above f450, 000,000 have been collected and disbursed without revealing, so far as I can ascer tain, a single case of defalcation or em bezzlement. The closest scrutiny of con gress is invited to all the methods of ad ministration and to every item of expen diture. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. The friendly relations of our country with (he nations of Europe and of the East have heen undisturbed, while the ties of good will and common interest that bind us to the states of the West ern hemisphere have been notably strengthened by the conference held in this capital to consider measures for the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by congress, the representatives of every independent state of the American continent and of .Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 1889, and continued in ses sion until the 19th of last April. This important convocation marks a most in teresting and influential epoch in the history of the Western hemisphere. It is noteworthy that 'Brazil, invited while under an imperial form of government, shared as a republic in the deliberations and results of the conference. The rec ommendations of this conference were all transmitted to congress at the last session. International Marine Conference. The international marine conference, which sat at Washington last winter, reached, a very gratifying result. The regulations requested have been brought to the attention of all the governments represented, and their general adoption is confidently expected. The Slave Trade in Africa. At the conference of Brussels, to de vise means for suppressing the slave trade in Africa, it soon became evident that the measure proposed would tax the resources of the Congo basin be yond the revenue available under the feneralStatesof act Berlin of 1884. The taited not being a party to that act, could not share in its vevision, but by a separate act the independent state of Congo was freed from the restrictions upon a customs revenue. The demoral ising and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest attention of the conference, and the delegates of the United States were foremost in advocating measures for its repression. An accord was reached, the influence of which will be very helpful and extend over a wide region. As soon as these measures shall receive the sanc tion of the Netherlands, for a time with held, the general acts will be submitted for ratification by the senate. Mean while negotiations have been opened for anew and complex treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States and the independent state of Congo. The Bepulrile of Brazil. Toward the end of the past year the only independent monarchial govern ment on the western continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist and was succeed ed by a republic. Diplomatic relations were at once established with the new government and it i4 confidently believed that the good relations of the two coun tries will be preserved. The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a revolu tionary change in Salvador, which was not recognixedby other states, and hos tilities broke out between Salvador and Guatemala^ threatening to involve all Central America in conflict. The efforts of this government were promptly and Malouely exerted to compose their dif- •awuuei/ mvi wu vu«u «u ferences and through the active efforts of the representative of the United States, a provisional treaty of peace waa slgned August 20, wlieteby the right of the republic of Salvador to ohoose. its own rulers was recognised. The kil ling of Gen. Barrunaia on board the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala,' demanded careful inquiry, and resultedin recalling United States Counsul Mixner from his post at San Jose, for exceeding! the bounds of his authority in intervening, in compli ance with the. demands or the Guate malan authorities, to authorize, and ef fect, in violation of precedent, the siezure on a vessel of the United States of a passenger in transit charged with political offenses in order that Ee might be tried for such offenses under what waa described as martial law. Tile Kltatafm Caaal Protect, under the control of our citizens, is making most encouraging progress, all the preliminary coqpitions and initial operations having been accomplished within the prescribed time. Claim* Aaaliut Chill. During the paat year negotiations have been renewedfor the settlement of the claims of American citisens against the government of Chili, principally grow ing out of the late war ,wttn Peru. Early and satisfactory adjustment is ex pected. Oar Relations With Cfclaa, which have for several yean occupied so important a place in our diplomatic history, have called for oareful consid eration and have been the subject of much correspondence which has re sulted in better relations between the countries. Inpursuance of theconcurrentreso lution'of Oct. 1,1890,1 have proposed to the governments of Mexico ana Great Britain to consider a conventional regu lation of the passage of Chinese laborers across our southern-and northern fron tiers. Sir Edmund Monson, the arbitrator selected tinder the treaty of Deo. 8,1888, rendered an. award to the effect that no compensation waa due from the Danish government to the United States on ac count of what is commonly lmown as" the Carlos Butterfield claim. Our relations with the French Repub lic continue to be cordial. Our repre sentative at that court has very dili gently urged the removal of the restric tions imposed upon our meat products, and it is believed that substantial prog ress has been made towards a just settlement. Samoaa Alkln. The Samoan treaty, signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the United States,' Germany and Great Britain, after due ratification and ex change has begun to produce salutary effects, alike just to the native ancl equitable to the three powers most con cerned in trade and intercourse with the Samoan Islands. Extradition and Seal Fisheries. The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain, after due ratification, was proclaimed on the: 25th of last March. Its beneficial working is al ready apparent. The difference between the two governments touching the fur seal question in Behrihg sea is not yet adjusted. The offer to submit the ques tion to arbitration,proposed by England, has not been accepted for the reaison that the form of submission proposed is not thought to be calculated^to assure a conclusion satisfactory to either party. In the tariff act dutiea were levied on certain commodities Which are included in the reciprocity treaty now existing between the United Stares and the the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indi cating the necessary exception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope congress will repair what might otherwiae seemto be a breach of faith onthepart of this gov ernment. 'MiiM Claim* Against Hayti. "..Nv. Owing to disorders prevailing in Hayti the terms of payments in the Van Hok kelen award were not observed by Hayti. A new agreement as to the time of payment has been approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the United States will, it is hoped, speedily yield to friendly treat ment. .'. 'Extradition with Italy. Propositions for the amendment of the_ treaty of extradition between the United States suii Italy are now wider consideration. You will be asked to provide the means of accepting the in vitation of the Italian government to take part in an approaching conference to consider the adoption of a universal rongitude jrime meridian from which to reckon and time. In° this connection I may refer with approval to the sug gestion of my predecessors, that stall ing provision be -made for accepting, whenever deemed advisable, the'fre quent invitations of foreign govern ments. Delagoa Bay Hallway. An interruption of cordial relations with Portugal was threatened in the summer of 1889 by the seizure by Portu gal of the Delagoa Bay railway, which was constructed under a concession granted to an American citizen. All other means of redress having failed, the concessionary appealed to the Unit ed States. The matter has been sub mitted to arbitration by three eminent jurists who have been appointed by the president of the Swiss Republic. Friendly Belation* with Mexico. The friendship between this country and Mexico, born of close neighborhood and strengthened by many considera tions of intimate intercourse and recip rocal interest has never been more con spicuous than now, nor more hopeful of increased benefit to both nations. The intercourse of the two countries by rail, already great is making constant growth. The importance of the Mexi can railway system will be further en hanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a link in the projected inter-continental railway. I recommend that our mission in the,City of Mexico be raised to the first class. Reciprocity With Cuba. The extent and development of our trade with the Island of Cuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with a peculiar im portance. It is not doubted that a spe cial arrangement in regard to commerce, based upon the reciprocity provisions of the recent tariff act, would operate most beneficially for both governments. This subject is now receiving attention. The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratify ing occasion to honor the memory of the great inventor, to whose genius our country owe3 so much. On the 2d of September last the com mission appointed to revise the records of the commission under the claims con vention between the United' Slates and Venezuela iu 1866ebrought its labors to a close within the period fixed for that purpoKe in a manner satisfactory to both parties. 

DEPARTMENT REPORTS. The Country'* l?j»iuicug. The revenues of the government from all Bourn* lor the fiscal yeur ending June SO. "liSBO, we're $403,903,080.05, and the total expenditures -for the sangs period were $358,018,584.52. The sur plus for the year, including the amount applied to tho sinking fund, was $105, 844,496.03. Tho receipts for 1890 were $16,030,923.71), and .the expenditures $15, 989,871, in excess of. those of 1889. Tho customs receipts increased $0,885,842.88, and the receipts frrfm "internal revenue $11,725,191.8ii, while on the side of ex penditures that for pensions was $19, 812,075.96 in excess of the preceding year. The treasury statement for the cur rent fiscaUyear, partly actual and'partly estimated, is as follows:: Receipts from all sources,. $406,000,000 total expendi tures $854,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,009,000. The loss of revenue from customs during the last quarter is esti mated at $25,000,000, but 'from this is deducted a gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the first four months of the year. For the year 1892 the total -(estimated receipts are $373,000,000, and the estimated expenditures $857,852, 209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of 115,147,790.58. RemonntUIng Silver. The act "directing the purchase of silver bullion and- the: issue of treasury notes thereon," approved July 14, 1890, has been a4ministered by the secretary of the treasury with an earnest purpose to get. into circulation at' the earliest possible dates the full monthly amounts in the treasury notes contemplated by its' provisions and at the same time to give to the 'market for silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recent monetary disturbances in England, are not unlikely to suggest a re-examination of opinions upon the subject of an international conference looking to an. agreement touching the full use of silver for coinage at a uni form rate. 'Our very large Supply of gold will, if not lost by impulsive legis lation in the supposed interest of silver, give us a. position of advantage in pro moting a permanent and safe interna tional agreement for the free use of silver as a coin metal. Increase of Money in Circulation. The efforts of the secretary to'increase the volume of money in circulation by keepiing down the treasury surplus to the lowest practicable limit have been unremitting and in a very high degree successful. The increase of money in circulation during tbe nineteen months has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per capita, and of this in crease (only $7,100,000 was due to the recent silver legislation. That this sub stantial and needed aid given to com merce resulted in an enormous reduc tion of the-public debt and of annual interest charged is a matter of increased satisfaction. I notice with great pleasure the state ment of the secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year nearly J12,000,000 and that the cost of collect ing this larger revenue was less by $90, 617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year, The percentage of cost of collecting .the customs revenue was less for the last fiscal year than ever before. The Army. The report of the secretary of war ex hibits several gratifying results during •the year. The percentage of desertions from the arniy has been reduced during the past year 24.8 per cent. 1 concur in the recommendations of the secretary that, adequate and regular appropria tions be continued for coast defense workB and ordnance. Plans have been practically agreed-upon, and there can be no good reason for delaying the exe cution of them while the defenseless state of our great seaports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition. The encouragement that has been extended to the militia of the states generally and most appropriately designated the "National Guards" should be continued and enlarged. The Beport of the Attorney General shows that a vigorous and, in the main, an effective effort has been made to bring to trial and punishment all violat ors of the laws. Especial attention is called to the facts connected with viola tions of the election laws, and of offenses against United States officers". There have been several cases where postmast ers appointed by me have been subject ed to violent interference in the dis charge of their duties. Some of these cases have been dealt with through the department of justice, and in some cases the post offices have been abolished or suspended. I have requested the post master general to pursue this course in all cases where other efforts failed to secure for any postmaster an opportun ity peacefully, to exercise the duties of his office. Bilt such action'will not sup plant the efforts of the department, of justice to bring the particular offenders to punishment. The vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of naturalization, upon bills in equity filed by the attorney general in. the circuit conrt of the United States is anew application of a familiar equity jurisdiction. Neaily one hundred such decrees have been takeo during the year. And in this con nection I beg to renew my recommenda tion.that the laws be so amended as to require a mpre.full and searching in quiry into all the facts necessary naturalization before any certificates are granted. PoRtpffide Department. The report of the postmaster general shows the most gratifying progress in the important work committed to his direction. The business methods have been greatly improved. A large econ omy in-expenditures and an increase of $4,750,000 in receipts have been realized. The deficiency -this year is $5,780,800, as against $6,350,183 last year, notwith standing the great enlargement of the service. The passage of the act to amend cer tain sections of the revised statutes re lating to lotteries, has been received With great and deserved popular favor. The Navy. The construction and equipment of the new ships for the navy have made very satisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels havd been put in commission and during this winter four more, including one monitor, will be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized is being pushed, both in. the government and private yards, with energy and watched with the most scrupulous care. The,experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resisting power of armor plates have been so valuable as to. attract great attention in Europe. The only part of the work upon the new ships that is threatened by unusual de lay is the armor plating, aridevery effort is Demg made to reduce tliat to the min imum. Jnterlor Department. The report of tbe secretary of the in terior exhibits with great clearness the vast work of that great department ana the satisfactory results attained, ine suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to the consideration of con gress. The Public Lands. The severul acts of congress locking to the reduction of the larger Indian reservations, to the more rapid settle ment of the Indians upon individual al lotments, and the restoration to the pub lic domain of lands in exce?s of their needs, have been carried into effect. Agreements have been concluded since March 4, 1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,7^6,000 acres of land. These with the Sisseton and Wahpeton, Sac and Fox, Iowa, Pot tawattamoies and absentee Shawnees, and Coeur d'Alene tribes, have not re ceived the sanction of congress. Atten tion is also called to the fact that the appropriations made in the case of the Sioux Indians have not covered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. If an agreement is confirmed all of its terms should be complied with without delay, and full appropriations should be made. Patents to Settler*. The policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patenting of lands to settlers upon the public domain has been carried bnt in the adminis tration of the land office. No general suspicion or imputation of fraud has been allowed to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual cases upon their merits. The purpose has been to perfect the title of holiest settlers with such promptness that the value of the entry might not be swallowed up by the expenses and extortions to which delay subjected the claimant. The average monthly issue of agricultural patents has been increased about 6,000. The Disability Pension Act, which was approved on the 27th of June,' last, has been put into operation as rap idly as was practicable. The examina tion and adjudicatian of claims have, by reason of improved methods, bean more rapid than ever before. The an ticipated expenditure, while very large, will nc\ it is believed, be in ex cess of the estimates made be fore the enactment of the law. This liberal enlargement of the general law should suggest a more care ful scrutiny of bills for special relief, both as to the cases where- relief is granted and as to the amount allowed. The Mormon Question. The recent letter of Milford Wood ruff, president of the Mormon church, in which he advised his people "to re frain from contracting any marriage forbidden by law" it is hoped will be highly beneficial in restraining all in fractions of the laws of the United States. But the fact should not be overlooked that the feature or belief of the church that polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by divine revelation, remains unimpaired. It is quite true that the law should not at tempt to deal with the faith or belief of any one but it is quite another thing, and the only safe thing, so to deal with the territory of Utah as that those who believe in polygamy to be rightful shall not have the power to make it lawful. The Census* The enumeration of the people of the United States under the provisions of the act of March 1, 1890, has been com pleted and the result will be at once officially communicated to congress. The completion of this decennial enu meration devolves upon congress the duty of making anew apportionment of representatives "among the several states according to their respective num bers.". At the last session I had occasion to return with my objections several bills making provisions for the erection of public buildings for the reason that the expenditures contemplated were in my opinion greatly in excess of any public need. No class of legislation is more liable to abuse, or to degenerate into an unseemly scramble about the public treasury than this. There should be ex ercised in this matter a wise economy based upon some responsible and impar tial examination and report as to each case, under a general law. Agriculture. The report of the secretary of agricul ture deserves especial attention in view of the fact thattheyear has been marked ma very unusual degree by agitatioi and organization among the farmers looking to an increase in the profits of their business. It will be found that the efforts of the department have been in telligently and zealously done to the promotion of the interests intrusted to its care. A very substantial improve ment in the market prices of theleadine farm products during the year is ob servable. Export trade in live animals and fowls also shows a very large in crease. Nearly aOO.OOO more cattle and over 4o,000 more hogs were exported than in the preceding year. The export trade in beef and pork products and in dairy products was very largely increased. The information given by the secretary of the progress and prospects of the beet sugar industry is full of interest. It has already passed the experimental stage, and is a commercial success. The area over which the sugar beet can ba successfully cultivated- is very laree and another field crop of great value ii offered ,to the choice of the farmer. Civil Service. The law relating to the civil service, as far as I can learn, has been executed by those having the power of appoint ment in the classified service with fidel ity and impartiality, and the service has been increasingly satisfactory. The re port of the commission shows a laree amount of good work done durintr the year with very limited appropriations. '.?.*• 

LEGISLATIVE. I congratulate the congress and the country upon the passage at the first session of the Fifty-first congress of an unusual number of laws of verv hieh importance. That the results of tfiis legislation will be the quickening and enlargement of our manufacturing in dustries, larger and better markets for our breadstuffs and provisions both at home and abroad, more constant em ployment and better wages for our working people, and an increased supply of a safe currency for the transaction of business, I do not doubt. General Trade autl Industrial Conditions throughout the country during the vear have shown marked improvement. For .many years prior to 1888 the merchan dise balances of foreign trade have been largely our tavor, but during that year and the year following they turned against us. it ?s verv eratifvine to know that the last fiscal year balance in our favor of over $68,000,0W. The value of our oxports of domestic merchandise during thelast year wM over $115,000,000 greater than the preceding year and was only exceeded once in oui history. About $100,000,000 of this .ex cess was in agricultural pursuits. The production of pig iron-al ways a Rood truage of general prosperity—is shown by a recent census builetnv to be 18.58 per cent, greater than in 1880, andthe production of steel 290 per cent greater. The general testimony is that labor, is everywhere fully employed and the Te ports for the last year show a smaller number of employes affected by strikes and lockouts than in any year since 1884. These promising influences have been in some degree checked by the surpris ing and very unfavorable monetary events which have recently taken. plsoe in England. It is gratifying to know that these did not glow in degree out ol the financial relations of London wittt our peoplj or out of any discredit at-, tached to our securities held in that market. The return of our bonds ana stocks was caused by a money stringency in England, not liy any loss of value or nrwiit in the securities themselves. Tlio Tariff Law. The general tariff act has only par tially gone into operation, some of its important provisions' being limited to take effect at dates yet in the future. The general provisions of the law have been in force less than sixty days. Ite permanent effects upon trade and prices still largely stand in conjecture^ It is curiouB to note the advance in pricesof articles wholly unaffected by tne tariff act which is by many ascribed to that. Notice was not taken of the fact that the general tendency of the market was upward from influences whoUy apart from the recent tariff legislation. The enlargement of our currency by the silver bill undoubtedly gave an upward tendency to trade and had a -marked effect on prices but this natural and de cided effect of the silver legislation was by many erroneously attributed to the tariff-act. There is Neither Wisdom Nor Just lee in the suggestion that the subject of tariff revision shall be opened before this law has had a fair trial. It is iuite true that our tariff schedule is subject to ob jections. No bill was ever framed, I suppose, that in all its rates and classifi cations had the full approval even of a party caucus. Such legislation is always and necessarily the product of compro mise as to details, and the present law is no exception. But in its general scope and effect, I think it will justify the support of those who believe that American legislation should conserve and defend American trade and the wages of American workmen. The mis information as to the terms of the act which has been so widely disseminated at home and abroad, will be corrected by experience, and the evil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the savings banks, international trade balances and the general prosper ity of our people. Already we begin to hear from abroad and from our custom houses that the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the act is not justified. The imports at the port of New York for the first three weeks of November were nearly 8 per cent, greater than for the same period in 1889 and 29 per cent, greater than in the same period of 1888. And so far from being an act to limit exports, I confi dently believe that under it we shall se cure a larger and more profitable parti cipation in foreign trade than we ever enjoyed, and that we shall recover a proportionate participation in the ocean I-carrying trade of the world. Prohibitory Legislation. There is no disposition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or re I taiiatory legislation. Our -policies are adopted not to the hurt of others, but to I secure for ourselves those advantages 1 that fairly grow out of our favored posi tion as a nation. Our form of govern ment, with its incident of universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall save our working people from the agitations and. distresses which scant work and wages that leave no margin for comfort always beget. But after all this is done, it will be found that our markets are open to friendly commercial exciianges of enormous value to the or'ier great powers. rile Reciprocity Clause of the tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure a large recipro cal trade in exchange for the free ad mission to our porta of certain products. The ri^ht of independent nations- to make special reciprocal trade concessions is well established, and does not impair either the canity due to other powers or what is known as the "favored nation clause," so generally found in commer cial treaties. What is given to one for an adequate agreed consideration cannot be claimed by another freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could dispense with any import duties upon coffee, tea. hides, and tne lower grades of sugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the coun tries producing and exporting these ar ticles by placing them on the free liat entitled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs concessions upon artieles exported by us to them was so obvious that to have gratuitously abandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade would have been an unpardonable error. The indications thus far given are for very favorable action by the countries from which we receive our large imports of coffee and sugar, and it is confidently believed that if steam communication with these countries be improved and enlarged, jnext year will show a most gratifying increase in our exports of breadstuffs and provisions, as well as of some important lines of manufactured goods. 

WORK OF THE SESSION. Importii'it measures to Re Passed. In addition to the important bills that became laws before the adjournment of the last session, some other bills of the highest importance were well advanced toward a final vote, and now stand updn the calendars of the two houses in favored positions. The present session has a faxed limit, and if these measures are not now brought to a final vote all the work that has been done upon them by this congress is lost. The proper consideration of these, of an apportionment bill, and of the annual appropriation bills will re Wire not only that no working day of the session shall be lost, but that meas Snfi^ «??lno^ local interest shall not be allowed to interrupt or retard the progress ofthose that are of universal interest.
