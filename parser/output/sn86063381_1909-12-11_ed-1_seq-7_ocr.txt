CAUSES A LOSS OF ONE MILLION ill Night Fire Sweeps City of Kalamazoo, Mich. HOTELGUESTSROUTED OCT Three Hundred Half Clad People Driven Into the Icy Streets, Many to Remain Several Hours Without ShelterFlames Finally Brought Under Control by the Assistance of Outside Fire Departments. Kalamazoo, Mich., Dec. 11.One life was lost, many firemen were over tome by smoke, 300 hotel guests were driven, half clad, into the icy streets fend property valued at approximately #1,000,000 was destroyed by a fire here which was extinguished only after an til night struggle by the combined fire fighting forces of Kalamazoo, Bat tie Creek and Grand Rapids. Starting in the basement of the Star Bargain House the flames, fanned by strong southwest wind, spread east iwird along the north side of Main street, totally destroying the Burdick Mouse, a four-story hotel and store hwilding, covering more than half a city block. On an arcade running north through the Burdick building to Water street were half a dozen small1 commercial establishments and these were burned out. Sweeping eastward on Main street from the Burdick the flames ate their way through the Postal Telegraph feted American Express offices, Chase's shoe store, Bowldeck's men's furnish ing store, Kennedy's drug store and other business places. As it became apparent that the lo cal fire department would be unable to cope with the situation aid was Summoned from Battle Creek, twenty jftve miles east, and Grand Rapids, ntty miles north. 1 Refugees Suffered In the Cold. Quests in the Burdick House, warned of their danger, fled hastily to the street, many of them scantily clothed, fknd some were compelled to remain In the biting cold several hours be fore finding shelter. While the flames were raging in the hotel a man suddenly appeared at an Upper window and cried for help. Be fore a ladder could be put in position he disappeared and, it is believed, per \shed in the fire. The extent of the fire is attributed to the fact that the city depends on artesian wells for a water supply and because the amount available was en tirely inadequate. A large standpipe at an asylum was connected with the city mains, but afforded only tem porary relief. So great was the shortage of water that at one time only two streams could be directed upon the fire and these barely reached to' the third floors. At 5:30 a. m. a city main was con nected with a nearby creek and with the aid of the Battle Creek and Grand -Rapids firemen the flames at last were brought under control.
