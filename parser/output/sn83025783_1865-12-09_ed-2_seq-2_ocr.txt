The Congress of the United States commenced its business on Monday, Dec, 3, and the Presi dent has read his message to both houses. Mr. Colfax has been re-elected Speaker cf the House by a large majority". In the Senate Mr. Sumner introduced a se ries of bills in reference to establishing a repub lican form of government in the District of Columbia, and guaranteeing the same to the States lately in rebellion ; to enforce the Con stitutional amendment forever prohibiting sla very j to regulate commerce between the States; and to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to inform the Senate whether any persons are employed in the Treasury Department who have not taken the icquired oath. A committee of thirteen has been raised to act with a committee from the House in rela tion to the death of President Lincoln. Mr. Dixon presented r?solutions, which have passed the Connecticut Legislature, in favor of equality before the law. Mr. Wilson will present a bill at an early day to abolish all laws which recognise partial civil rights in consequence of differences in race, color, or descent. In the House of Representatives Mr. Went worth introduced resolutions for the relief of Mrs. Lincoln, by payment of her husband's salary in full. Mr. Stevens presented the following resolu tion, which was previously agreed upon by the Republican caucus, and it passed by a vote of 123, to 36 opposed: 44 Resolved, by the Senats and ?lotise o f Repre sentatives in Congress assembled. That a Joint Committee of fifteen members >hali be appoint- j cd, nine of whom shall be members of the i House and six of the Senate, who shall inquire! into the condition of the States which formed j the so-called Confed?rate States of America, and whether they, or any of them, are entitled to be represented in either House of Congress, with leave to report at any time, by bill or otherwise; and until such report shall have been made and finally acred upon by Congress, no member shall be received into the House from any of the said so-called Confederate States; and all papers relating to representa tives of said States shall be referred to said < Committee without debate*'' TTport the passage of this resolution the Southern delegations wisely concluded that ? they might as well return home. Mr. Stevens introduced another resolution \ which allows wounded soldiers to accept of Government employment and receive pensions at the same time. !, ! I A special committe was appointed to consi- : der that part of the President's message and j all documents pertaining to the affairs of freed [ men? Mr. Brigham proposed amending the Consti tution relative to the laying of export duties, end prohibiting the payment of the Confederate debt, etc., insuring to all persons equal protec tion to life, liberty, etc. A resolution was adopted granting the use of the hall to a public meeting of the Fteedraen's Commission. Mr. Farnsworth offered a resolution declar ing that good faith demanded that the colored soldiers should be entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens of the United States. Both Houses adjourned till Monday the 11th instant. The action of Congress hus inspired the heart j of every true lover of his country. It will not ? ask any indemnity for the past, but demand se- i curity for the future. That security can only be realized by carrying out the provisions of the Constitution, and guaranteeing a republican form of government to all the States. We had high hopes of this Congress before it assembled, but our faith has been increased ten fold since it came together. Its opening seems have strengthend our confidence in the final tri umph of liberty, justice, and equality, and con firmed us in a belief, long e ntertained, that there is, after ail, more patriotism, more truth, and more fidelity in the nation, than what the na tion generally gets credit for. 

ABSALOM BOSTON.-In these days of anxiety With reference to the status of the coloerdAmcr ican, and epecially in this slave-cursed lo cality where the fangs of secessiontsm yet pro trude in all of their original ugly deformity^ venomously announcing that loyalty to the Union means simply the right to hate the Yan kee and abuse thc Negro, it is pleasant to turn our eyes Northward, and remember that col ored men have there lived, and been respected and honored as citizens cf this great Republic, and whose right at the ballot-box there were r.or.e to deny. The name of Crispu* Attucks viii live a? long as the memory cf the Revolu tion is preserved. Robert Banneker will be rccogniied as a man of genius by every student of astronomy. On the island of Nantucket, the home of the while fishery, lived a colored man by the name of Absalom Boston. He had pursued the whale-fishery, until, becoming master of this daring enterprise and a thorough navigator, he was placed in command of a whaling vessel. His officers and crew were all colored men, except the cook, who was a ichiit man. Sever al succe$*ful voyages were performed, and Captain Boston won for himself thc respect of all who knew him. In all bu? ness transitions Isis word was considered as good as a bond. He lived to an advanced agc, and died a Christian, universally beloved? The mortality among the freedmen in North Carolina has greatly decreased since the estab lishment of a medica! department in the Freed men's Bureau there. The President*8 Message. President Johnson has sent his first message to Congress* It is a lengthy document, but not masterly. The supremacy of the General Gov ernment is forcibly set forth. His old doctrine, that "rebels must take back seats" in the re organization of the rebellious States is plainly visible. He justifies the establishment of mili tar}?'governments in each of the insurrectionary States. AU acts of secession wer.e null and void and could have no binding effect upon the people. Individuals have proved themselves traitors, but the States never have beeh out of the Union. The General Government nas in terfered only where the functions of the Gov ernment have been cut cff, and will maintain its authority until the States can resume their proper functions. Provisional Governors were appointed to endeavor to restore the proper re lations between the General Government and the States. The same requirements which have previously been made for the States to adopt in order to acquire re-admission to the enjoy ment of federal relations, are again reiterated. The Government's faith requires that the freed men should be secured in all the rights of lib erty and property. The message will have its effect. There ?3 no thing in it that will impart comfort or consola tion to secessionists. The loyal heart will find in it only that in which he can rejoice, thank God, and take courage. It has not recommend ed many things which we deem important?, but we trust that Congress will not forget them. We shall pnblish some extracts from the mes sage next week. South fJ?r?lina L?gislature. The Legislative proceedings during the p?st week have been uncommonly uninteresting. Provisional Governor Perry has made a fare well address, and Governor Orr has rtiade his Salutatory. The appointment of district judges and other State officers has consumed much time. Insolvent Laws, Stay Law?, Usury Laws, etc., have been up and tinkered; Gov. Orr, iii ? message to the Legislature, says that the people of the State bannot pay taxes, and suggests that no appropriations of money be made for any of the schools ?r col leges j and thinks that certificates of indebted ness to the amount of half the taxes should be issued. He recommends a memorial to Con tr?es to alter the law which assesses a direct tax, in such a manner that the State may pro vide for its payraenf. Also, that the South Ca rolina College may be changed to an university, and that the Citidel should be self-supporting ; that an agent should be appointed to collect the property of the State; that District Boards should be organized, and an Asylum instituted. 

RIGHT TO LABOR.-The address of Colored People of South Caroling- so justly worded and inantully put forth as to entitle it to respecful attention everywhere-places the Labor question in stong relief before the White masters of the South. These orators declare " You have given us little or no encourage ment to engage in agricultural pursuits, by re fusing to sell us lands, while you are organizing societies to bring foreigners into the country, thc clear intent of which is to thrust us out, and re duce us to a seifdom intolerable to us.and as you will find in the en/l ruinous to your own pros perity." These are the words of true patriots, audit is plain that the colored men of South .Caroline. Understand the case-New York Tribune. ANOTHER CONVENTION.-Thc colored people of New England have just held a Convention in Boston. Charles L. Ilemond, an unmixed African, was the President. The object of the Convention was to petition Congress to so amend the Constitution of the United States that a general qualification for voters may be fixed for all the Stares, and the status of the colored American citizen clearly defined. 

REPORTED NORTH.-The New York Tribune of the 29th ult. contained a very fair and com ' plimentary report of the Colored People's Con vention held in this city recently. The New York Herald's repork is full of blunders, but aivps the Convention credit for doing its busi ness with mnrked ability. The Boston Journal has a very accurate report. Many of the most influential papers at the North noticed the pro j ceedings with friendly comments, in " agreeable j contrast" to their severe rebukes of the Legis lative proceedings of this State. THE RIG??T VVAT.-WC have received the j first number this spi?ted little paper, printed in Boston, with the above name. George L. Stearns is the publisher, and we long to see its principles adopted by the Amcric'uri people, for the ri^ht way is always the easiest. CORRE>PONDENCE.-We devote a large por j tion of our paper to-day to correspondents. It j gives us pleasure to publish the sentiments of j others, but we desire that they should be brief, i in order that a variety of information may I be given. We publish a Charleston corrpspon j dence of a Northern paper, which we commend as worthy of careful perusal. I * _ J_ I --~ TAXATION.-The colored people cf South Carolina, lately assembled in Convention at Charleston, made, we think, a good point j against the ruling Reconstruction in their de j ciaration of rights and wrong: j ?We have been subjected to cruel proscription and our bodies have been Outraged with impu j nity. We have been and Still are, deprived of the free choice of those ho should govern , us, and are su bjected to art unjust taxation without representation, arrd h"ave bled and toiled ! for the elevation of those who have degraded j us, and still continue to oppress us. j A stronger and simpler statement could not j be made, and every word of it is liteially true j M Taxation without representation " sounds j much like the Declaration of Independence' j but it is a hint which has been forgotten at the j North ever since 2776. We wonder, since col i ored men cannot vote in Philadelphia, or rest ? their tired bodies in the cars, whether the old : cracked heil of Independeuc i Hall remembers it:-N. Y. Tribune. The 23th regiment (colored) was paid off at j Hartford on Saturday. It took $175,000 to ; ?go round.' and the men got about $200 apiece, j a good share of which was very soon exchanged I for clothing and other things, some of them ! neither necessary or beneficial. The men ren ierai ly behaved very weil and would compare I favorably with white troops in that respect. Affairs About Home. GROUNDLESS FEARS.-We have heard from goori authority, that some planters upon the Cooper River, in the neighborhood of the Santee, are very much troubled about an insurrection among the colored people theie. And we have heard such stoyles often, tt seems like a waste of words to explode-not the fact that fears exist among the planters, but the utter groundless ness bf such fears. A race that has remained quiet and inoffensive for upwards of two hun dred years under the most oppressive systoni of tyranny the world has ever known, will not now, under the smiles of liberty, attempt the destruction of the planters. If the whites in the tidinit^r have any project on foot for degra ding and wronging the colored man, they may well have their fears of an insurrection, al though we believe that a majority of former slaves would yet "suffer long and he kind" even to the hand that should smite them. The plant ers ought to learn to deal justly with the col ored man, and to love mercy and walk humbly in the.?ight of God. All fears of insurrections might then vanish, and peace and happiness dwell in the hearts of all. Anothef reptrt has been widely Circulated in regard to the colored people on the Island of Edisto. And the statements were so straightfor ward that Gen. Beecher, was ordered there to put down the insurrectionists, rle found a large number assembled together quietly enjoying the perusal of the Loader and other loyal newspapers. The General was as much surprised not to find an insurrection as the people were to know that they had been suspected of such a thing. The persons who originated these foolish and absurd stories should remember the fable of the shepherd boy who cried '-wolf." EDISTO ISLAND, Dec. 3rd, 18?5. Editor LKADEE. The people of this island have been in the habit of meeting here every Saturday to hear the Leader and other papers read to inform themselves of what is going on among our peo ple in other places. While discussing these to pics, we were surprised by receiving a dispatch that General Beecher, with troops, had arrived on the island. On his reaching the church, he informed us that reports had reached Charles ton that the Jieople of Edisto wefe a lawless band ; that they contemplated insurrection ; and that he had been sent to establish order among them. Never, Sir, were reports so false, so malicious. A mote orderly people is no where to be found in the State, as will be seen in the General's despatch to his commanding officer. M EDISTO." THANKSGIVING.-A union service of all the colored churches in this city was held at the Zion Presbyterian Church at 10 o'clock A. M., on Thursday last, the occasion of the National Thanksgiving. The church was densely filled with an apprciative and attentive congregation. Services commenced by singing. Rev. J. C. Gibbs offered prayer, and Rev. T. W. Lewis read from the Scriptures. The first address was made by Rev. C. II. Corey, and evinced deep thought and clear perception, richly em bellished. Rev. James Hamilton, of Philadel phia, followed. Other addresses were made bv Rev. Wm. Lyall, Rev. T W Lewis, Rev E J Adams, Rev Mr Fripp, of South Carolina. Captain Ketchum, Allen Coffin, and II Judge Moore, Esq., of Charleston. The speeches were interesting and profound. They abounded in noble and loyal sentiments. All seemed to feel the same gratitude for the blessings bestowed upon us, and rendered thanksgiving and praise td the Almighty for his fatherly loving kindness and tender mercies during the last year. Our pen Will riot do justice to the oc casion, and we can only say that it was the best meeting we ever attended; It was a real old fashioned New England Thanksgiving, only more so. DELEGATES TO WASHINGTON.-Messrs'. A. J. Ransier, Edward White, arid Robert Ddnccn, have been selected a committee to proceed to Washington and have presented to Congress the Memorial bf the Colored People's Convention. Other important business will also be attended to by the Committee. It is quite probable that the voice of the colored people of South Caro lina will be heard and felt in the halls of Con gress long before the representatives elect get a view of their coveted seats. The President says that the Representatives had better send on their credentials, as Congress may have nb lise for the men. 

FORT SUMTER.-In company with tlev. N. Norton, D. D., of the New 1fork (Erie) Metho dist Conference, Rev. I. P. Warren, Secretary of the New England Branch of the American Tract Society, and others, by invitation of Gen. Howard, we visited Fort Sumter On Monday afternoon last, in the steamer ?disto. Large quantities of broken shell and shot lie at its base On the Morris Island side. Its wails are terribly broken and shattered, and in looking upon this ruined mass and recalling its history, we could but exclaim, " Ichabod, thy glory hath indeed departed ! " EMANCIPATION DXT-The first of Jannary will be the anniversary of President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation; Efforts are being made to observe the day in Charleston with ap propriate ceremonies. A grand procession will be formed including thc various societies of colored people, Sabbath Schools, etc. Every person who rejoices in the freedom of mankind should contribute towards making this day memorable in the history of Charleston. A barbacoe is contemplated. We trust that the friends ot emancipation in the State will en deavor to have the day observed. J3T It is now qtfite'saSsfacrorily agreed up on that the following gentlemen have reallv been elected as members eft Congress from this State; General Kennedy, fron1! the first district; Ex-Governor Aiken, second ; t?eneral McGow an, third; and Hon. James Farrcw, fourth. "CONTRAST."-While in this city, Qen. Grenf received a 44 polite " invitation to din'e eli if& Charleston Hotel, with some of our merchants. The invitation was very politely declined. 

HILTON HEAD-Gen. Grant was received at Hilton Head by Col. Green, commanding. The 6th Regulars and the 21st colored trcops turned out and made a fine appearace. GEN. GRANT.-The Lieutenant General left Charleston on Sunday morning, 3rd inst., for Savannah, by special conveyance; He visited Fort Sumter and Hilton Head on hi* way. On friday evening the colored people gave him a serenade. The procession numbered over a thousand. MajVGen. Sickles responded, say ing that Gen. Grant fully appreciated the com pliraent and was duly thankful for such a spon taneous tribute of respect from the loyal heart of South Carolina ; he had no where witnessed a more gratifying demonstration of loyalty to the Union. On Saturday Gen. Grant was visited at the headquarters of Gen. Sickies, by several of the Northern missionaries arid schoolteachers, gov ernment officials, Colored citizens, and some few others; The English ship ?> General Wind ham " displayed her dolors during the General's visit here. ?EV?VALS.-Quite a revival of religien among the colored people of this city is now going on. Protracted meetings are being held at several of the churches, and many converts have been found. LBCTUBE.-Rev J C Gibbs delivred the lec ture on Monday evening of this week at the Normal School. ?* Giants" was the subject, and the subject was handled without gloves. The Rev. Mr Adams gives the next lecture oh Mon day evening, Dec ll. Gov. CURTIN, of Pennsylvania, arrived here on Wednesday, in the steamer Hugh McCul loch," with his family, en route for Cuba. COMMUNICATED. To the Editor of the leader. CHARLESTON, S. C-. Dec. 5. 1865. Siii,- In your paper of the 2nd inst., under the heading Hardships of Freedmen," I find mention of a.case of defrauding a freedman at Hilton Head. It seems he was inductd by some swindler to sell his cotton crop of one hundrea pounds for ten dollars, and the same c?ttbn was sold again soon after for forty-five dollars. It is well to publish every such case as this which is discovered, both as a warning to the freedmen and to attract the attefition of Lhe authorities whose duty it is to prevent these abuses. But one reflection in this article might seem a little unjust in its application,vis., *lt is pain ful to know that those who have authority to prevent such villainous transactions put forth no effort to remedy the etil:' The officers and agents of the Freedmen's Buread are author ized, and it is their plain duty to rbrriedy, such evils } and I am happy to say that they are constantly interfering to this purpose through out the State, a? they have abundant occasion to do. To show you that this matter has not escaped the attention of i'll of the authorities, as well as to give publicity to a regulation so important to the welfare of the freedmen, I en- j close for publication a copy of an order just issued by the Assistant Commissioner, and in tended to protect the lreedmen in the sale of their cotton crop. Respectfully, C. H. HOWARD, Bvt. Brig. Gen., Inspec. txthefal, Bureau R., F. & A. L. HEADQUARTERS, ASSIST.

EDITOR-This article will be devoted to the freedmen of Hilton Head. I am not able to state, even proximately, the number of these people on the island, as no census has been tak en except cf Mitchelville. The writer made an estimate of the scholars in the colored schools last spring, and found about twelve hundred. These were ?h eleven schools, taught by twenty-two teachers, ali fe males but two. Four of these schools were in Mitchelville, and were kept, as they still are, in the churches. If these schools are fostered as they should be,- it will not be long before the teachers will come forth from their own ranks. There are a few now that would answer for as sistants, though not yet qualified, to take the en tire Charge of a school. Besides the day-schools/ evening schools' are kept in some of th? districts,- t?ught for the most part gratuitously, a'ncT attendefl mainly by adults. Still, others who attend no schools are acquiring some of the rudiments of education. Cart drivers, house domestics, and other labor ers, may be seen in their intervals of rest labor ing over their primers and spellingbooks, the more advanced aiding those behind. Such efforts are commendable, and should be encouraged. There is talent to be developed among these sable people, and it is Vasi?v' im p?t tant that it be rightly directed. The industrial habits of these people are va rious. The majority are sufficiemTv laborious, and, where their labor has been joined with prudence and economy, they are well-to-do. Those who planted th*ir own crops in the spring, and bestowed on them proper culture, have something to make their home*^.comfort able through the winter. Many, however; were not thus prudent. They have labored, more or U5s, butflfe spent as fast as they earned; rind are now ir?^ondi tion but little better than beggary. . ?~ The system of monthly wages has not worked well. The proprietors of plantations have kept stores of rations and other . things needed, and the people have eaten up their wages, and, in many instances, run in debt. They have been disappointed when the balance was found against them instead of in their favor. In some cases they have eaten up in a day, in pound-cake and other expensive luxuries, what might have lasted them a week. Such a bad termination of their year's labor has led to litigation in many cases. Some have a misty idea of contracts, and, if held strictly to them, they think they are hard ly dealt by. The systems of working land on shares, or leasing it at so. much an acre, have worked much better. These systems we now inculcate upon the people. We urge them to make early ?nd judicious selections of land for another vear, and resolve that they will retrieve the mis takes of the past season, Nothing in the management of these people Betrays such a lack of sense as their eagerness to buy horses, for which they will often pay six or ten times the worth of the animals. Several have paid $100 or $150 for skeletons that have hardly strength enough to draw an empty cart. Then they think they can keep them on mouldy corn blades,- but precious lirtie corn, - and marsh hay. The result is the horses are so in discreet as to die, and leave the owners poorer, if not wiser men. They then come to the Bu reau for redress. The agents help them when they can, but make it a point to warn them against such folly in future. The people in Mitcheville are, or have been, largely employed in the "Forts." as they call the business part of the town. They come over the narrow bridge in long linos in the morning, with buckets, baskets, bags, havers cks, etc., and return at evening vvith those articles filled variously. Some contain household neees-sries, while others are filled with broken stale bread br other refuse of cookhouses. This may Ue cilled dry swill, and is intended for sundry black, wi ite, and speckled swine. The people find employment in the ^tables, in the commissaries, in the stores, in policing the street?, and other situations. Some sell plants, oranges, and other edibles. On the wholt, the industrial condition of the colored people on the island is no wors' than we might expect, though susceptible of great j improvement. There mu.-?t be great improve ment before they will be 5elf-8Upp< rting in the? true sense of the Word. About 200 are rationed ! by the Government, confined mainly to the aged and helpless, and orphan childi rn. The social relations of the freedmen wiL be considered in another article HILTON HEAD, Dec. 3, 1S65, Editor of th? Sovth Carolina Leader. WATTEUBOKOUGH, S. C., NOV. 29, 1865. Sm,-I ri joice that your independent journal lins planted itself on the sure ground of <qual rights. It ? natural for a journal which has from the beginning so bra vt ly and constantly opposed slavery in ill ks pietehtions, should now insist that these pr?tentions shall be trampled out, so that nothing shall be left to' breed future trouble. This can be done only through the establishment of tqud rights. To my mind, there never was a duty plainer or more instinctive. If the eountiy fails to do ? this justice now, what will occur in the future? If I were to put into one single sentence a pre scription for the people of the United States it j would be this-"Make lull Ana rican citizens of colored men." By so doing, we shall be come an independent na?on. Are you riot fur ther gratified to see the old stain of prejudice which existed among our down-trodden race, fast dying out ; and there is now a union of feeling existing t?:at did not exist when the old 35th first entered the service. While I am in the so-called sunny South, our eloquent gen tlemen at home are ever laying before the pub lic our just rights as citizens of our noble birth place; and we feel much encouraged to see the magnanimous sentiments of our brothers who have met in council for the elevation and pro motion of our race. May the time soon come when nations shall karri of wars no more, and peace and quietness reign throughout the land of America. Yours, respectfully, H. D. DUDLEY, 1st Scrgt., Co.

No one should monopolize ali the tfme in talking, no matter how much kn?w I ledge he may possess. And to derive the most 6enefit from conversation with each other no angry disputes should arise: Opinions may dif fer, and they may be stated plainly, but to argue them into a passion will not be profit able. i begin tb feel that I have left home and friends far behind me, and that between those I ?ofe and other men there is an impassible bar rier of class distinction. Many of the 35th Regt. ?. S. C. T, think that they have done enough for the Government to entrth; them to the privileges of voting. Whe??ver We have been called upon to go fortfc and defend the national honor, we have cheerfully gone, like brave soldiers, to defem* the stars and stripes. No one wrHr say that colored men are not fit for sohlfers. They have pleaded the rights of tfife white men upon the battle-field, and now j ask that the white men shall plead their cause! in the hailU of Congress. Liberty and equality for the colored man is just what liberty and equality is to the white man. We are for the Union, one and indivisible. The colored man was the same in 1812 ; he was the same in 1776 ; and if we are possessed with the light to ballot for ihosT^f^^ laws, you can count on us if Jfo, . e 1 not leave Mexico when ordered. ^ ??
