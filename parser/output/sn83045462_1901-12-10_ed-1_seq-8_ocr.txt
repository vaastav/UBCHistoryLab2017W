Prowsition te Give Greaud for Street Extenasio--Werk of the Pa"k "ag Comaission. Communications from several citizens' as soclations were received and read at the regular meeting of the Northeast Washing ton Citizens' Association, held last night at Northeast Temple. One of the comamunica tions was from the Cathedral Heights As scclation, asking co-operation In the matter Of~eoring better service on the suburban electric lines. The East End Association asked assistance in its efforts to get a park at 15th and H streets northeast, the site of the old Graceland cemetery. Secretary Wood of the East End Associa tion explained that the association which he reprevekts has asked the District Com missioners to provide for a park to occupy the space north of the Benning road as far as K street and from the Bladensburg road to 18th street. He explained- that property owners beyond this tract are willing to give ground for the extension of certain streets. The trustees of the cemetery property, he said, are not prepared to donate 53 per cent of their property to provide for street extensions. Secretary Wood said that Con gress has failed to give relief since the condemnation of the cemetery. The prop erty, he said, cannot be disposed of to ad vantage because the streets to be extended have been mapped out. An offer of $75,000 has been made,'but the secretary believes it is worth at least $250,000. Until some thing is done with the cemetery property Maryland avenue will not be extended. With the territory beyond the Bladensburg and Benning roads opened up property In North east Washington will become more val uable. President Tucker of the Northeast Asso ciation, speaking on the question of ex tending Maryland avenue and getting a park at the place stated, referred to Mr. Thomas W. Smith, who was recently elect -ed president of the Board of Trade, and said he was the right man in the right place. Mr. Smith, he said, Is an East Washington man, who favors this improve ment, and in order to secure It the co-op eration of the East Washington associa tions and Board of Trade will be necessary. Gratfeland Omitted. Mr. Wood said he had seen a portion of the plans of the parking commission, and no reference in it is made to the Graceland cemetery property. A park on Mulligan's Hill, opposite Mount Olivet cemetery, and another one near Langdon, will be recom mended in the report, he said, which is to be made public the 1st of January. Mr. Nash voiced his objection to the es tablishment of parks on the sites mentioned. He said protests should be entered at an early date. The people of the northeast section want a breathing place. He said he desired to repeat his motion of last year to include the space between North Capitol and 1st and L and M streets north east, which Is now practically a vacant lot. This lot, he argued, should be set apart for base ball and foot ball purposes. Mr. Frizzell called attention to the law and to the work done by the parking com mission. He spoke of the Mulligan Hill property, where It is proposed to use sev enty acres for a public park, the park to remain in Its present wild condition. After further discussion the proposition was adopted and referred to the propercommit tea. Secretary Sowerbutta read a oommunica tion from the Federation of Labor con cerning the move made last month by the Northeast Washington Association relative to the enforcement of the law requiring seats for clerks employed in stores. The federation will co-operate with the associa tion, and the members of the latter or ganIzation are informe4, in the letter that the matter will be called to the attentian: of the Central Labor Union, Dr. Kirby said he had looked' up the law on the subject, and he finds It In a matter that may be.enforced without any trouble. Dr. Walter chairman of the committee on police, said he thought nothing should be done until after the holidays. Mer chants, he said, cannot-be expected to pro vide seats for .the number of clerks who are employed during the rush. The matter was disposed of by author izing the committee to act with the Fed eration of Labor in seeing to the enforce ment of the law. Extension of an Avenue. A communication from the Northeast Suburban Association asking assistance in its efforts to secure the extension of New York avenue was referred to the street committee. Mr. Frizzell, chairman of the committee on -steam railroads, referred to the ques tion of a location for a union depot, saying the last plan proposed places the depot on .Massachusetts avenue northeast between North Capitol and lt streets. The whole matter, he said, is in chaos again, and there is no telling what the outcome will be. Mr. Sowerbutta of the street committee calied attention to a letter that had been written to the Commissioners with, refer ence to the dangerous condition 'of the asphalt pavement on North Capitol street between I and K streets. After the con struction of the railway line the asphalt was repaired, and there is a fail there of oine foot in eIghteen inches. Mtr. Holsten suggested that an effort be made to compel the railway companies to provide protection for the motormen. Mr. Nash, referring to the street cars, attacked the combination vehicles, charac terizing them as an intolerable nuisance. Mr. Flemming said the combination "re frigerator" cars had been placed on the C street line. The Capital Traction road, he said, is contemplating some Improvement in the matter of placing vestibules on its cars, In Baltimore, he said, the companies have been required to give protection to motormen. Other routine matters were discussed be sore adjournment.
