DEATH. It Came to Mother MoKinley in the Night. The Long Vigil of Her Distinguished Bon Came to sn End Shortly After a O'clock Sunday Morning; The Arrange- -ments for the Funeral. Canton, O., Deo. 13. Mrs. McKinley passed from life at a few minutes past 8 o'clock Sunday morning with all of her children and other immediate rel atives at her bedside. She did not suf fer any in her last hours, but gradually passed from the deep Bleep in which she had rested almost constantly for ten days into the sleep of death. The end was beautiful in its quiet and peacefulness. Mrs. McKinley seemed to sleep so soundly that it wa difficult to tell whether she had yet breathed her lasj. This condition con tinued for half an hour. There was no struggle. She seemed to sleep her life away. Funeral service over the remain of Mrs. McKinley will be held in the First Methodist Episcopal church of this city at 1 o'clock Tuesday after noon. Interment will follow in West Lawn cemetery, just west of the city, and Tuesday evening President Mc Kinley and wife and the officials from Washington who attend the funeral will leave for the capital. Rev. Manchester, the pastor of the church, will extend an invitation to the minister of all the churches, of which there are about SO, to occupy the pulpit and participate in the serv ices. ' Pall-bearer have been selected from among the older members of the church and those who for years have been close neighbors of the deceased. They are: Judge William R. Day, Hon. William A. Lynch, ex-Mayor Cassidy, L. L. Miller, W. W. Clark, Judge Mc Carty, David Zollars and ex-Mayor John F. Blake. The First Methodist church is the one in which Mother McKinley wor shipped during her residence in Can ton and in which she was found almost every Sunday morning. ' Three weeks ago yesterday she was in her pew as usual, and though she was nearly 89 years of age her attendance had been regular all the while. This is also the congregation with which the president has always been associated. It was in this church that he was superintend ent of the Sunday-school 80 years ago, and here that he always attended Bervice when in Canton, usually going with his mother. They last attended together last September. The presl dent is a member of the board of trus tees of the church. It is a coincidence that Mrs. McKln ley died at almost the identical hour of the dav as did her husband on Thanksgiving, five years ago. Mrs. McKinley came of the race of hardy pioneers who laid the founds' tion of the American republic. She was Miss Nancy Campbell Allison and was born at New Lisbon, O., in 1809. She was married to William McKinley, sr., January 6, 1829, and was living in a two-story frame house, still standing near Niles, O., when her distinguished son was born, January 29, 1843.

FEDERATION OF LABOR. The . Seventeenth Annual Convention I Held at Nashville, Tenn. President Com per Tells of the Progress of a Year. Nashville, Tenn., Dec 14 The Amer- cap Federation of Labor began its 17th annual session in this city Monday with an attendance of more than 100 delegates from different states, and an equal number of visitors. The federa tion met in the ball of the house of representatives at the state capitoL President Gompers presiding. Havelock Wilson and Edward Har ford, delegates from England, were in troduced by the president Mr. Wilson is a member of parliament and Mr. Harford is ex-secretary of the railway employes' organization.

President Gompers then read, his an nual report He said: "With two exceptions, all our affili ated national unions report a large in crease of local unions and in member ship There is an increase of about 84,000 in the organizations affiliated. 'It has been the constant aim to or ganize our fellow workers engaged in unskilled labor. With .the invention of new machines and the application of new forces, the division and sub-division of Jabor, many workers who have been employed at skilled trades find their occupation gone. Thus we see the artisan of yesterday the unskilled laborer of to-day. Within this past year a very large number of federal labor unions for unskilled workers have been organized and from them a much larger number of trade unions. "There have been a number of strikes within the past year, but the change in the causes which have produced them are worthy of note. The strikes of this year with few exceptions have been for hjgher wages, shorter hour and the extension and reorganization of union principles. Our organizations report with gratifying unanimity, the very large number of successes achieved, advantages gained and growth in the power of the organiza tion enjoyed. 'The movement to reduce the hours of labor is always one which com mands the first attention of organized labor. We hold that no condition is satisfactory nor any solution complete which fails to eliminate the curse and the degrading influences of non-em ployment and ' so long as this evil shall be with us our best efforts will be concentrated to the reduction of the hours of labor of all until the de sired end is attained. "The establishment of a postal sav ings bank system and' also a postal telegraph system, long since demanded by organized labor, seem nearer ac complishment than at any previous time. 'It is submitted whether it would not be wise to modify our position in 60 far as to interpose, no objection to the passage of a law providing for com pulsory arbitration in disputes be tween the organized employes of rail roads and the railroad companies, and the giving of an award by such law ful arbitrators; but we should hesitate to give our indorsement to any legis lation, state or national, empowering the compulsory enforcement of an award and the specific enforcement of a contract to labor." During the year 276 strikes were officially noticed, involving. 105,407 workers. Of these 189 were won; 81 compromised and 33 lost During the year 217 charters were issued to na tional, state, central, local and federal labor unions. Two charters for state federations were issued to Ohio and Missouri. Indications are favorable for a continuance of the use of labels. 

STRUNG THEM UP. Cnbans Hang Spaniards Who Come to Them and Ask that the Autonomy Scheme be Accepted. Havana, Dec. 14. It is officially an nounced that the Spanish forces under the command of Gen. Pando in the province of Puerto Principe, pursued Gen. Maximo Gomez so closely that he was obliged with about 200 men of his escort to seek refuge in the woods and mountains. None of the commissioners sent by Gen. Pando to different parts of the island to negotiate with the insurgents for their acceptance of the autono mous form of government proposed by Spain have returned, which seems to confirm the reports that some o. them have been hanged by the insur- gents and others have remained with the enemy.

Fall River, Mass., Deo. 14. The man ufacturers' committee which is con sidering the proposed cut in the wage of mill operatives will recommend that the salaries of the treasurers be re duced in the same proportion as the wages of the employes, and each mem ber of the committee has agreed to bring about this reduction in the ad ministrative cost in his own milL The committee also decided that all over seers and others not usually included in cut-downs should come under the order. . The price for weaving a cut of print cloth will be reduced from 18 to lfl cents, and in departments where the least pay is received the full cut of 11 per cent will not be made. The com mittee also agreed that a cut of 10 per cent was as much as the operatives could bear. Notices of the reduction will be posted in the mill to-day or to-morrow, but the details of the new sched ule will not be given out until a day or two later. If the operatives ask for a conference the committee will recom mend that it be granted. The commit tee is unanimously in favor of includ ing everybody connected with the mills in the reduction and also in op posing a strike in every way possible. Robert Howard, of Boston, former secretary of the Spinners' union, says: 'In reading over the names of the committee of the manufacturers who are to draft the details of the cut down and decide how it is to be in flicted,' I notice seven names of agents among them whose combined salaries amount to. 850,000 a year, or nearly 81,000 a week A reduction of 10 per cent in these salaries would be equiv alent to a reduction of 125 weavers at 88 a week. ',' LATORRE'S DECREE., It Exceeds in Cruelty Anything; that Wey ler Devised to Exterminate Non-Corn-batants. Havana, Dec. 14. Don Augustin La- torre, military commander of the city of Puerto Principe, has exposed with a few strokes of his pen the hypocrisy oi Spain's alleged policy of mildness un der Gen. Blanca The barbarous de cree of Latorre exceeds in cruelty any thing that Weyler devised to extermi nate non-combatants, women and chil dren. v Two hundred families .already have fled from Nue'vitas panic-stricken. The decree was believed' at first to be merely a threat, but a few days ago a woman was shot in Nuevitas for the sole crime of leaving her home with out permission of Latorre, to buy pro visions for her family, and terror spread in the city and the general ex odus 'began. A dcr.en murders have followed. Latorre has revoked In his decree all codes of international law. The foreign consuls are forbidden to raise their na tional flags and they dare not harbor their countrymen who demand protec tion. The consular agents in Nuevitai of the United States, England, France and Germany have written To the con sul generals of those nations in Ha- vana, explaining the gravity of the situation and protesting against La torre s decree. The decree prescribes the death pen1 alty for any resident, without distinc tion of sex or age, who shall leave home or even stand at the door with out permission of the authorities. IT
