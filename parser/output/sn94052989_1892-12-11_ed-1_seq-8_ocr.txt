A New Orleans Circuit Judge Defines the Geary Act- Deportation Is the Onl\ Redress. Bycelal to Tax MoHNi.ts Calx. New Orleaks, D«c. 10.— Judge Billings Id the United States Circuit Court quashed tb« indictments against several Chinese for violating the exclusion act, aod defined the powers of Governmrnt officials. lie laid In brief: "The statute relied upon by the pros centlng offlceri ii found in the fourth sec tion of the act of Congress of May 5, 1892. That statute, it nams to me, deals with the coming in of Chinese as a police matter, and H Is the re-enactm* and continuing of what ■Ight be termed a quarantine against the Chinese. They are treated as would be in fected merchandise, and Imprisonment is set puuishment for a crime, but the means •f keeping the damaging individual safely till he can ba sent away. In a summary ■tanner and as a political- matter this eemlng in is to be prevented. The matter It dealt with as political and not criminal. The word* used are those ordinarily found in the Criminal Statutes. But the intent of Congress is, as it seems to be unmistakable, that after the unlawful presence of an alien la determined, he must be sent back to his country by the Treasury Department at Washington, and to prevent unreasonable, and possibly oppressive detention, it must be within one year. Meanwhile he must be kept from entering' the community of the people of the United States, and therefore la to be imprisoned to prevent expense to the Government and as sanitary matter be la to be made to work. •This, it seems to me. Is the meaning of the clause relied upon to authorize the trial and punishment for a crime. There Is nothing in the statute declaring It shall be a crime or a misdemeanor for a Chinaman to come into this country. Unlawfulnoss is not made the basis of criminal procedure or de ttntioD, but rather made a warrant to scud kirn back. The imprisonment spoken of in tbe atatute is that which is necessary to effectuate bis return. It seems to me that Mcticn 4 deals with proceedings before tbe commissioner conducting an examina tion, which is political and not criminal, aod amounts to a direction to him, and the authorities who conduct tbe transportation •r removal back to China, aud is two-fold— first, that the Chinese adjudged to be here unlawfully shall be removed within a. year, and, secondly, that until tbe removal he •ball be kept in prison and made to work. "In accoidance with these views I must direct that this indictment be quashed, aid ibal the defendant be remanded to the cus tody of the •ommissioner to be doalt with according to law.

Dec. 10.— Jack McAuliffe, the cbampiou lightweight of tbe world, and Billy Myer, bis old antagonist, came to gether at the Second Regiment Armory for six rounds to-night. The setto was ex ceedingly lively, and the men needed but alight encouragement to turn the boxing match into a regular fight. It was 10:30 o'clock when VlcAuliffe, who was received with loud cheers, clambered through the ropes. He was followed five minutes later by Myer, who received a still warmer greet ing. The gloves were said to be five-ounce. In the first round the men took it easy, al though Myer got in a hard one on the head. In the second round McAuliffe landed lightly on Myer's ear. Tbe latter came back at him, but time was called. Tbe crowd disapproved in vigorous .style, as the round was not over a minute long. In tbe third round Myer jabbed Mc- Auliffe bard in the face. He dodged an i slipped, falling to his knees, and when he got up he received several more hot ones. McAuliffe opened the fourth round by crowding Myer around and forcing him to tbe roDea. In rhe fifth round McAuliffe landed repeatedly on Myer's stomach. Neither would give ground and they banged away savapely, Myer's blows being as hard as his antagonist's. Clinches were numer ous and the men were separated twice. \\ hen time was called and the contest over neither man was marked and both were fresb and looking for more. YALE STUDENTS ARRESTED.

WILL NOT DOWN. The Ogre of Protection in England. FARMERS NOW EMBRACE IT. Threatened Rapprochement Between the Artisans and Agriculturists. Bimetallism Not Possible. Special to The Mobxixs Calu New York. Dec. 10.— Smalley's cable letter to tho Tribune contains tb« following: The Ribot Cabinet in France is a sur prise to everybody, including Ribot himself, lie was talked of last February, before Carnot discovered Loubett, but was not then asked. Ho is able, but perhaps adventur ous; nor Is It thought judicious that the Foreign Minister should also be President of the Council. Toe use of the President of the Council is to keep the Ministers in order— to moderate their zeal— an apply two minds instead of one to difficult questions. Ribo', moreover, Is a liut partisan of the Franco - Russian alliance. It may be doubted whether St. Petersburg will receive his appointment with enthusiasm. The aim of St. Petersburg is to tame the friendship of Pans not to stimulate it. Nor is this moment when a Minister with a future, as Rihot has, or Lad, need care to become Fiitr.e Minister. There is no sure promise of stability for his or any otber ministry. The Chamber is completely out of hand. Parties are split up. The various factions of tbe Republicans are more ltreconcilibly hostile to one another than to the Royalists, The Panama question must be faced. The Radicals thought they were coining in by l.eiu of the Panama scandal, and are not pleased with tbe turn things are taking, nor is Brisson, as a politician, pleated. The probabilities of elevating the Panama com mittee into a committee of public safety are somewhat diminished. President liarrisou's message provokes a curious outburst of Eujjlish spleen. What the Eiiglsh papers Bay of it is what tbe Democratic press in America might be ex pected to say. The comment is ; purely par tisan. Tiie English hostility to Harrison is as marked as the English friendship to Cleveland, and both aro fur the same reason. They knew tlmt Harrison aud the Republican party could be relied on to pro tect American interests. Tlmy know that under Cleveland's rule British interest! are once more t» be favorably considered. Of the generosity to a defeated opponent, there Is no traoe in these British remark*. The proceedings of tbe natlounl agricul tural conference held In London Wednes day and Thursday may be Hummed up in two words, "protection and bimetallinni." Protection will not down. Just as America is supposed to have given this hated princi ple a iintl blow It lifts Its horrid form in St. James Hall in London, and an out-and-out protectionist resolution Is carried unani mously, or almost unanimously, amid thun dering cheers. Who are the men who carried it? Admit tedly the conference is the representative and most powerful and Important assembly of farmers in Great Britain. It is com posed of delegates from more than 240 es'cciations in England, Scotland and Ire land. B< th farmers and laborers were del egates, tnough the laborers seem to have been very few. The wbnls number of Jel egates present exceeded 2000. An tx-Cabl net Minister presided and another Cabinet Minister was chief speaker. The press reports It at great length, and discusses with something like true sense the gravity of the occasion. Tne agricul tural interest is still, as one of them says almost sorrowfully, the greatest, as it Is the oldest, of British industries. It is suf fering, and has long been suffering, from extreme depression, and now with one voice It declares that there is no remedy for Its misfortuoe.3 aud no escape from ruin other than protection. When Salisbury pronounced this word at Hastings his party revolted, or at any rate the party organs and fanatics of free trade said it revolted. Ha was rebuked in lan guage of the utmost solemnity. IJe was thought to have contributed something to the defeat of his partr, which followed fast upon his Hastings ipe6«h, and I*, her* Is half of Eugland echoius the cry of the late Prime nster. Half of England Is a rhetorical expres sion, but if you consider what tue landed Interest in this country mean* apd repre sents it is hardly an extravagant expres sion. There i», at any rate, no question of party or parly politics In this resent move ment. It is too serious for politics. It is an <ffort of naif-ruined and half-desperata men who have long appealed for help to others and are now trying to help them selv Their real difficulty Is far nioro serious than hostility of doctrinaires. The farm ers would make short work of the doctrin aires if they had nobudy behind them. Their difficulty is that in this country pro tection means two thing*, one thing to the farmer and another to the artisan. The farmer cau only bo saved by a tax on food, and to a tax on focd the artimn will never consent, unless he ee.ts an equivalent In come from protection that would raise his wages. If they could ncree they would toon revise England's tariff .vs. The resolution of the conference makes an attempt to meet this difficulty. It begins with the assertion that unfair coruDetltion, ofuntaxed foreign Imports with home prod uce and manufactures advanely affects every trade and industry in this country. It is plausibly put, but the artisan nt thirty shilling* a week wants to know what it would mean lv the price of a loaf. The farmers, moreover, have weakened their case and arranged almost the whole finan cial world against them by their adoption of bimetallism. The double load it too heavy. Protection In England, remotest it may be, is a conceivable thing; bimetal lism is not. But who could expect a body of plain farmers to resist the sonorous eloquence and captivating manners of Henry Chaplin. No more affecting spectacle ins ever been seen in public life than that of Chaplin, Salisbury's Minister of Agriculture, pub licly ombraoing Archbishop Walsh, and commending hid to an English, avipmbly as an authority In finance. It is Dr. Walsh's merit— a merit which in Chaplin's eyes atones for his political heresies—to nave discovered tint the true cause of Ireland's woes is the increase in the value of gold, and the tru* remedy for thtm— bimetallism. 

WORK AT BRUSSELS. The Conference Yet Considering Plans. Austria has No Fear o! Disastrous Results Following the Failure of the Meeting. 6p«elal to Tri Morning Cali. Brussels, Dec. 10.— At to-day's meeting of the committee of the international mon etary conference the plans of Tietjens, Houldswor.h and Allard were debated. Although the bimetaliist delegates feel that the position Is critical, they are hopeful the conference will not aaj^uru without adnpu ing a resolution recommending the various Governments interested to adopt a tem porary modus Vivendi with the view of averting a financlr.l catastrophe. Before the conference proper Tirard of the French delegation explained His position in regard to bimetallism. lie said that under the present circumstances there was do chance to substitute bimetallism for monometallism. Each country had the remedy In its own hands by Increasing the coinage of silver. If every country in creased its coinage of silver to twenty francs per capita, which is less than half o! France's total coinage of silver, the amount of silver in circulation would be enormously Increased. The committee adjourned without reach ing a decision on any of the plan 9. Rondos, Dec. 10.-Tbe Standard's Vienna special says: The probable failure of the monetary conference Is so discounted here that the failure will ninke no impression. The principal Austro-Hungarian papers ridicule the prophecy of terrible conse quences, contending that any action such as is foreshadowed in President Harrison's message would be a breach of faith toward creditors, which public opinion in America would not permit. Neither Democrats nor Republican*. It Is aaid, dare repeal the Wiu dom act for fear of an unparalleled commer cial crisis. Meantime tbe removal ot the hope of an International agreement for many years to come will exert a healthy Influence in checking the output of stiver, and prices will gradually find a level with out harming anybody except the American silver kings. Practical experience in the transformation of silver currency to gold currency resulted In converting passionate bimetalllsts to the view that the rehabilita tion of silver would fail to remove the root of the causes of agricultural depression. THE 

SHERMAN ACT. Senator Teller Says It Should Not Be Repealed. Washingtok, Dec. 10.— Senator Teller, one of the warmest champions of sliver, is very decidedly opposed to the repeal of the Sherman silver law, and looks upon the bill Introduced by llill a 9 a menace to the while metal. "1 am opposed to any interference with the Sherman act," said Teller, "for any repeal of that lk\v means r further depredation of silver. Of coinse the law is not what it ought to be, aud we have always looked upon it as a temporary expedient; but it affords some relief. Until somethiug better aud more peimaueut is given us, stiver men would naturally ba opposed to its repeal. The Hill bill or any similar measure would depreciate silver even lower thau It new is and inciease the evil instead of remedy ing it." Teller thinks there will be no attempt at silver legislation tiiis tension. Certainly not until after the Brussels conference has reached some conclusion. "It that con ference." continued Teller, "does not do anythinglooking to the relief of the situa tion, then wo must do it. I am hopeful, however, that the conference will accom plish something, although it seems probabln now that it will ndj urn over until spring." Referring to the President's message, Teller said he could not understand what the President meant by saving we oould meet the Euiopean demand for our gold by legislation. "We are a dubtor nation," ob served the Senat>r, "aud cannot dictate term", much less legislate to suit ourselves in the matter." ASYLUn
