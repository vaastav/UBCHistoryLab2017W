WILLIAMS - - Editor NO THANKS FOR THEM. While President Wilson’s message to Congress was brief and anything but comprehensive, it was not limited to a single subject and it dwelt in passing on a variety of topics other than the industrial disputes question— on foreign selling agencies and cor rupt practices and Porto Rico, for in stance. In view of this fact, it seems less of an oversight than a piece of repre hensible neglect that the President failed to say one word of commenda tion or sympathy for the militiamen on the Mexican border. A large proportion of these men have made great and definite sacri fices in order to serve their country. Many of them are men with import ant business connections and their business interests have suffered ma terially through their absence from home. Their competitors have reaped golden rewards as a result of the present prosperous business condi tions and they have been deprived of their share of that porsperity. The families of some of them have suffer ed more or less privation because of their patriotic response to their coun try’s call. Yet these men have en dured these things and the discorr. forts and hardships of life on the bor der without whimpering. And the President of the United States apparently does not regard their services as of sufficient value to deserve even the slightest word of thanks.—Baltimore Sun. C. & D. Canal The fight for an appropriation for the purchase of the Chesapeake ana Delaware Canal will be waged in this session of Congress more vigorously than in the session of last yaer. Those advocating making the canal a part of the inland waterway system and, therefore, a source of military use, propose to demand of Congress an ap prop.iation on that ground that the enlargement of this canal as a federal ship waterway is imperatively neces sary on grounds of national prepared ness. In this fight they expect to have the support of the Engineer Corps of the Army, which has reported in favor of the purchase of the canal by the Unit ed States government and also the support of Navy experts, who were directed by Congress to investigate the project from the point of mili tary necessity in case of war. Under a resolution passed at the last session of Congress the Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments were authorized to appoint a committee of Army and Navy experts to make such an investigation and report to this session, A delegation of leaders in the inland waterway movement, headed by Rep resentatives Moore, of Pennsylvania; Small. nf New Hamscliirp and Ben nett, called on Secretary Daniels to inquire what had been done under the terms of this resolution. Secretary Daniels said that his experts were not yet ready to report, but will do so shortly. He said that he personally is in sympathy with the project.
