Every member is urged to be present. Committees appointed at the last State convention will please be ready to report. On as. B. Galloway, Chairman. P.S.—Ail State papers are re quested to copy.

Vanderbilt, alter a long life of successful money making is dead. Stripped of all that gave him prestige here, his soul has gone to stand as the veriest beggar before the throne of God. It seems now that the Presiden tial nomination in the Republican party will lie between Senator Sherman and Mr. Blaine, while John Logan is pretty certain to be nominated for Vice-President. There is such a tremendous dis crepancy between the tax that liq quor entails on the country, and the capital invested, that the cry of dis tillers for the protection of their capital from Prohibition Legislation, is absurdly ridiculous. The President's message is—well a little too long to be read with much interest by the average reader, un less he was paid to do so. Cleveland is wrong on the silver question. The coinage ol silver will hardly be stopped, though. Next week's paper will be the last number of this Volume. We have not taken the usual Summer or Fourth of July vacation, and as the Sword and Shield will be removed to Jackson, we will take flu* time from the 19th of December to the 2d day and first Saturday of January to make the change. W. The Prohibitionists were not suc cessful in their recent attempt to de test license in Okolona, but they will not be overly discouraged. They will try again; like the Greek athlete who gained strength every time he touched the ground, they gain strength by every conflict. We haven't heard any one say anything about our being set back twenty years by the Atlanta elec tion. Is there then such a wide dif ference between the Atlanta election and those elections that made the Atlanta election |possible, or is it that the scales are dropping from some folk's eyes, and they are pre paring to drop down off the fence: 

SOLID PROGRESS. The Senior has just returned from a trip to Northeast Mississip pi. Our first engagement was at OKOLONA, where a splendid audience of intel ligent men and women gave the closest attention for a little more than an hour. Though not quite strong enough to close the sa loons, the sentiment in growing in strength and volume. The W. C. T. U. is actively at work. SHANNON. . magnificent gathering Here greeted us, though the evening was rather unfavorably damp and cool. We were assured that the saloon a reign here would be over when present license expires. VERONA. There are no whisky shops here, but the place is menanced by two or three beer dens, was crowded to its utmost capacity and we had an earnest hearing, after which a class of young men and students of the splendid Academy, recited in concert a tem perance piece. It was good. The cause is strong here. 

TUPELO. We were there on Sunday night —a bad night for meeting, but a very good audience gathered, and gave marked attention to what we had to say. We were told that twelve church members gave the last applicant license to sell liquor. If their names had not been on the petition it would have failed. Awful re sponsibilities rest upon those twelve men. What a reproach to Chris tianity ! The city hall ot hoy to to is to no SALTILLO. Owing to a preaching service at the same, our congregations here was not as large as it otherwise would have been, though there was quite a nice number of young men, as well as ladies present, to whom we talked upon the # evils resulting from the moderate use of intoxi cants. We were glad the saloon keepers were present also. This place was once under Pro hibition, and we were assured by leading citizens it is ready for the law again. May the saloons soon be closed forever. The* leading citizens favor Prohibition and do not sign whisky petitions. 

BALDWYN is under Prohibition by a special election. We saw men on the streets and going to their homes sober, who, in saloon days, almost invariably left town drunk to go to the bosom of their families a very terror. Prohibition has dispensed multitudinous blessings here as everywhere else it is tried, spake to good crowds of friends ot other days two nights. At the conclusion of the last ad dress, the gifted Miss Mary A # F. Sovery. on behalt of the ladies of the town presented us, in a charm ing address the very loveliest hoquet we have ever seen. We had no words to fitly express our apprecia tion, either of the pure flowers and or warm, chaste words with which they were presented. To us the oc casion is an oasis in life's pilgrim age. May Heaven's choicest bene diction abide on the homes of the town of our earliest manhood. We will conclude these notes next week, with some remarks as to the general situation in North east Mississippi. is to be be as be of We did Senator John A. Logan, about the only handsome thing he ever did when he refused the nom ination of the Republican Senators for the presidency of the Senate» and will expect a handsome reward. When Blaine und Sherman are the leading candidates for the Republi can nomination for President "in 1888, which will he have the best hold on for the next place on the ticket ? He ran with Blaine and now gives up the position of acting Vice-President for Sherman. it Attorney-General Bradford ha paid a visit to Dodge City, Kansas where "there's more whisky sold than ever," and he gives an account of his trip clearly showing that the fault lay in the fact that the Mayor and city marshall protected the saloon atics from the law—a fault which he thoroughly did 'away with, everywhere it is proven that thr stronghold of the saloon keepers is in the city governments. s Thu.'

It was a fine address, and Mr. Mar shall fully sustaining his reputation as a belle lettre student and scholar. to of by T. to W. S. Webb, President Mississippi College. of This opiniou is heartily concurred in by the other members of the |' / faculty, and especially the Professor of English language and literature. As a specimen of the comments among those whose position and at tainments, give authority to what they say, we give the following: Clinton, Miss., Dec. 10,1885. Mr. Marshall's lecture last night on the aspect of English Poetry was a unique and elegant presenta tion of the subject. The arrange ment of topics was logical, the thoughts beautiful and the language chaste, the suoject inspiring. The course of lectures which he proposes to deliver cannot fail to be instruc tive and interesting, and and I hope will be greeted with even fuller houses than was the first. a THE WAY 

THEY DO IT IN KANSAS. Newton, Kan., November 28.—A warrant was sworn out a few days ago for the arrest of Mayor Reilly and seventeen other citiRens of Cald well, for resisting Officer Will Reed on the 6th inst. Reed undertook to arre9t and bring to Wellington a sa loon man who was found in a blind tiger. It will be remembered that a mob, in which the Mayor figured con spicuously, took the man from Of ficer Reed. LaRt evening Sheriff Henderson and his deputies brought in the Mayor and twelve others on this warrant. They were put under $200 bonds each and released. The saloon men of Sumner county are finding out that county attorney Murray means business.—Topeka Capital. It looks like friends of Temperance n that part of the country are as careless about who is Mayor of a town as some down here and that is the legitimate result of this exces sive non-partizanship in municipal affairs. to as ot of as Victory in Goodman. Once in its history Goodman has succeeded in crushing out the match less evil. About the last of October we succeeded in defeating a petition for license, also in preventing any more license for the space of twelve months. Yesterday our municipal election come off. It resulted in a signal triumph over the whisky party. We have worked hard, but are now enjoying a glorious victory. Goodman, Durant anil Pickens, three towns in succession, are Pro hibition towns. Better days are T. J. Bailey. They don't believe in non-parti zanship in Goodman, and so the victory. Prof. A. A. HopkiDS, one of the Prohibition speakers of the National Lecture Bureau, recently made a speech at Prohibition Central Hall New York city, in which he says: "It was a huge blunder of reconstruc tion, almost a stupendous sin that put ignorance over knowledge and mare possible gross mis rule through stupid misapprehen sion." So we have thought all along and we are ot the opinion that the Prohibition party, North, will bring to the front a class of politicians very different from those who enact ed the great wrong—a change that is sorely needed. coming. The Philadelpma Press in its is sue of Dec, 4, says : The indications all point to the selection of Senator Logan by the Republican senatorial caucus to-day for the office of president pro tem. of the Senate. Republican senators could not take any other coarse without disa pectations o publicans, who cast 4,848,000 votes for Blaine and Logan last Novem ber. ippointing the just f the great body of ex Re It seems to us that they might show some r gard for the just ex pectations of the American people, why, by a decided vote in 1884 de cided.that there should be a Demo* cratic Vice president for four years to come. s s Some Northern papers see already the improved legislation that will be passed by the next congress. One journal of great influence, after re marking that the Democratic party, by having the Executive Depart ment under its control and having a majority of the House, would con trol legislation, says that "the intel ligence of the Republicans in the House anc the Republican Senate would control the good legislation" that was forth-coming, and deplores the lack of ability in the 108 South ern members. is s The Rev. Sam Jones says: "When I got married, I went off 300 miles from home and got me a wife. We expect to do likewise—to teli the truth, we'll inve to—all the girls around Clinton know us. IS IT 

ADMISSABLE ! Editors Swoed and Shield: I was a little surprised to see in the Sword and Shield of the 28th inst., an essay on a controverted re ligious subject; a subject pertaining to the churches only. I refer to ar essay on "Unfermented wine for sacrament," by W. C. T. U. of Shu buta. I modestly suggest that a Pro hibition paper is not the place to dis the ordinances of the church of God. That belongs within the pale of Ecclisiology, and must be settled by those to whom our Divine Mas ter has committed the ordinance. There is a good old bo<>k which our Christian women dearly love, and that book says. "Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak." Most certainly our Lord has i»ot em powered them with the authority to regulate laws and ordinances govern ing His church; not upon the W. C. T. U. has He confined the authority to reform the church of the livin God, which is "the pillar and groun of the truth." To be candid, it is a serious ques |' io " w '' h ;n 0 " <! V, w, ,' e ' h , er such a cori ' troversy in a Prohibition paper will be productive of any good to, the Prohibition cause, and on that, ac count, very many of us who differ from the position assumed in said essay, will refrain from entering the arena of public discussion. I cannot but admire the essay on account of its admirable composition, its elegant diction, its precision of statement and the purity of the motive which the spirit of it reveals. Noble women are they, and what a power for good. They form a part of that great host under the leader ship of "Deborah," (Frances Wil lard) are routing the forces of King Alcohol and they will pursue on till the going down of the sun: And it will be woman who shall drive the nail into the head of the iniquitous monster and raise a memorial song of deliverance, which shall be sung amid rejoicings over all the land. The writer is in hearty sympathy with this great host, and will aid them in any way he can, but if he shall give them a gentle reminder of the will of the God of Israel cerning their position in the church and the limit they may not transcend, they will not get angry, but thank him for it. See if they don't. O. D. Bowen. Ilandsboro, Dec. 5th, '85. The article in question, was pub lished in the W. C. T. U. depart ment of the paper, which is edited by Mrs. C. Beall of West Point. We are not responsible for anything in that department. The question of fermented and unfermented wine is not, to us at least, a question of vital interest in the issue between the grog-shops and the homes. The preponderance of evidence we should think, lies with unfermented wine— it being probable that our Lord used the pure and not the fermented price of the grape to symbolize his blood, and no objection could be taken to that kind of wine, but it is not a question of vital interest in discussion of Prohibition, and is a question which does not affect the practice workings of a Prohibitory law. cuss con Mrs. M.

NOTES. Do you value the false favor of an unscrupulous man more than you do "the favor of God which is life?" Show us a man with moral cour age and we will then show you a man respected and trusted by both friends and foes. If you should ever feel discour aged again, try the magical effect of speaking out loud, so your heart can hear—Atlanta! A W. C. T. U. has been organ ized at Abbotts in Clay county. Mrs. F, M. Abbott president. There arc a dozen or more noble true wo men in that thriving little town who will build up one of the finest un ion in the State. When you fail to defeat a peti tion you cau close the saloon by en forcing the law, for we have vet fo know of one saloon when the law is not daily violated. Are we like ly to enforce new laws when we ig nore the protection offered in those we already have ? Mrs. Wells of Indiana will ar rive in Mississippi Jan. 6th'and will spend two days at each point on M. & O. R. R. from 4 S täte Line to Corinth. She will remain six weeks in the State. We do not feel that it is necessary to urge upon the W. C, T. U. a cordial recept ion to this noble temperance work er—for we are fully assured that her efforts in our State have been appreciated to the full. The W. C. T.U. in Okalona labored faiuhfully against the whis ky petitions presented in that place, but they were granted. Yet we must not call God's delays defeats, They went as God led them, they did all they were permitted to do; all was accomplished that was ready. Notwithstanding halts and hinder ance the eye of Caleb's faith could always clearly discern IDbron and the,faithful true hearted sisters there must wait without one question ing the order to "go] forward.' When human means fail to move an obstacle it is because God is hold ing it fast as a stepping stone to things higher and better than we know, and disappoimnents are bridges that God builds over quidk sands. 

TODDY'. Little Charlie W. was the idol ized baby one of a honafide "dis tinguished family" in an adjoining state to this. His father was one of the most elegant, cultured men in all the South, possessing simple faith with Norman blood and a kind heart with his descent from coronets His hospitality was as boundless as the skies, but not withstanding the rarest beverage, were always temptingly displayed upon her side board; he never in dulged himself beyond "a simph toddy," before each meal, when it was his pleasant custom to hold little Charlie on his knee and giv< him the sugar, with occasionally a sip from the glass. It was not long before Charlie demanded his seperate glass, and in time it be came a merry amusement of the household to watch the little man gasp for breath, as he "took it straight," and peals of laughter were won't to resound thtough the stately halls as the golden headed child would be seen to stagger and fall with intoxication. It was nearing the Yule time and a large demijohn of best egg-nog whisky had been brought in from town and for some unusual reason was de posited in au apartment, ing vessel did not fail to catch the eye of little Charlie and at the first opportunity to escape observation he clambered up the winding stairs twisted the bolt until the door stood ajar and proceeded to make an in vestigation. Night wore on, but it \vas not until the family had as sembled for tea, that Charlie's ab sence was discovered. Call after L. in on ot to of i * in is, In upper unoccupied The unfamiliar look in call rung out from nook and cor but sickening echo only »er, answered. Suddenly some one re membered the pattering of little feet upon the stairway, and the ex cited household took up the line of search in that direction. There in that fatal chamber lay little Charlie stretched out in a deadly stupor by the demijohn, it being supposed that he had tilted the vessel forward and imbibed until overcome by intoxication, will not attempt to to describe the horrow and anguish that moaned out the wrecked joy of that happy circle. The medical skill of the town was soon concentrated there, but at 12 o'clock, the sweet spirit of she beautiful child wafted up to its God, and to this day the face of that heart bre ken-.'ather wears the gloom of the horrid mid night in which his little boy died. What a shock it would have been been to the coming age of Prohi bition had the truth been written that little tomb-stone.—Died drunk; aged 3 years. We on Paulding. We are glad to learn that the good people of Paulding are mak ing a gallant fight against the li censing of a saloon at that place. The friends of temperance are al ways encouraged when public offic ers, like Mr. N. J. Sheely, circuit clerk, and Mr. M. G. Turner, Chancery clerk, of that county, throw the weight of their influence against the liquor traffic. All praise be to these two noble men for the good work they are doing. We hope the ladies of Paulidg will lose no time in organizing a W. C. T. U. They will find full instruc tions for organizing and working in the Path Finder, which can he had of Mr. W. H. Patton, at Shu buta, tor the small sum ot twenty five cents. The Mile Law. In Tennesse they have what is known as the four mile law. that is a law that no liquor shall be sold within four miles of any incorpo:at ed, or chartered institution ol learn ing, except in cities or towns of By this four certain population. | mile law in Tennessee the evil influ of the liquor trade is held off at arms length from the schools and colleges ol that State, and the young of both sexes are alike pro tected. This law has been tried by our'sister State for many years, and such is its universal favor with the people, that no polilician o( ;> >y party can be found with sufficient temerity to oppose it. Would it not be well for the legislators, soon to assemble in Jackson, to enact a sim ilar law for this State. We have a similar law for the protection of the boys at the A. & M* College, and at the University, and possibly at oilier Colleges in the State and now we ask the same for our daughters at the Industrial Institute and College at Columbus, and why should we not have it? Oh! says some one, "girls dont get on sprees and get drunk and what harm can saloons in Columbus, do with the Industrial Institute and College?'' I will tell you, this is a State Institute, draw ing its patronage from every part of the State. The girls are deprived of all the home influencss, while in Columbus, three hundred or more are congregated in this school, under the care of one man ami about a dozen ladies ; they must necessaryly walk the streets of Columbus and be more or less exposed to the con trolhng influence of the city. College while in a public street, is a mile, from that part of the city which is regular policed—it is situ ated too, on one of the main streets that leads out into the country and over which there is a large amount of travel by persons coming in and going out of the city. Saloons make drunk men ; drunk men are often boisterious and frequently obscene and vulgar. We want to feel that our daughters, when away from us and beyond our immediate protec tion and care, shall not be subjected to indignities, or forced to listen to the cuises and obscenity of men made drunk by saloons in the city of Columbus—Columbus has had this great benefactor bestowed upon her. and ii it is any deprivation to any part of her citizens to be relieved of the evil influences of dram shops, we hope they will not complain, for they must have known they were to get the College, cum onere, and for thr great advantages of the College to Columbus, it is not asking too much, we submit, that her people shall consent to an absolute Prohi bition of liquor saloons in this city. Friend. In Tennessee there is a law some what similar to our law on Corpora tions. but especially applicable to the incorpdfcitive of schools and col leges. By the Temperance Law, any num ber of citizens can, upon application, have themselves incorated as a body politic for school purposes, and pro ceed to establish a school, either a small one or a large one, as their circumstances may admit, and by a provision of the law, no liquor can be sold within four miles of any in corporated school. We suggest that the friends of education, the moth and the fathers of the State who love their children, and hope for their usefulness and happiness, join their heads, hearts aud hands in effort to secure such laws for Missis sippi. Who will start the move ? Suppose we all move together : If we ill, success will attend our efforts. once 1 a it a it it The ers wi Don't Kill Her; or »V. V. T. l T . State Organization. A word or two on the above will be in season. It is well that all who are interested in the W. C. T. U. of Mississippi should have accura ©. knowledge as to the State organiza tion. Mrs. Mary E. Erwin, of Columbus, (Miss.), is State President as you know, butas your neighbor does not know,please let her know,andtell her that we have as President one of the most devoted christrian women in the State. You know and ap preciate it of course, but tell your friends that all good women in the State should strive to uphold Mrs. Erwin in her noble and self-sacri ficing work. It takes some money to bear all the expenses of the great and arduous work, in organizing the State. As I happen to know, Mrs. Erwin has |idvanced considerable money of her own in this work, and your Union,my sister,ought to "lift" a collection right away to help her. It is not just that we take all of her time and money too. Tne State dues which are 25 cents per member of all local Unions, which should be sent to the Treasurer, (the writer), is not sufficient to meet half the necessary expenses of the "organiza tion period ' of the W. C. T. U. Another thing. You have no idea of of the pressing and multi plicity of duties which flow in, on and pile up on your devoted Presi dents heart, head and hands. Pray for her, give money to help her while she helps the cause, but please don't kill heb, by sending all cares and letters from all individuals and local L nions en quiring about a thousand and one things, which you ought to know about. When you wan't to know anything in regard to the organiza tion of the W. C, T. U. of Mississip pi, please write to Mrs. M. M. Snell, Columbus, the Corresponding Sec retary of the State Union. She will take pleasure in answering you, and she can tell you everything. Where you have any money for the S a l e Treasury, and I hope you will, right away, don't send it to the President or Secretary, for they are full of their more proper work, and it will cause double trouble. Send it di rect to Mrs. F. E. Steele, State Treasurer. Corinth, Miss, Let every Union have this read out in meeting, not for your benefit my watchful friend but for your less foruinatc neighbor, who with all her heart means right, but who may not know all these things. Yours for the love of the cause, F. E. S. 

FROM ABERDEEN. Aberdeen, Miss,, Nov. 30,1885. The W. C. T. U. of this place is so young that it will not consume much time and space to give its history. We organized on the 29th day of June with twenty members, which number has since increased to forty two. We meet regularly once a week, combining our prayer meeting and business conference. By our invitation, during the month of Oc - tober, two eminent Temperance lec turers visited our city, and addressed our citizens, it is believed, with good effect. We have circulated a number of temperance tracts, pamphlets, and periodicals. Our chief work, how ever, has been the establishment and superintendence of a temperance school. We hope to make this a permanent institution. It 3eems to be growing in favor with the class to whom its teachings are of most especial importance i e, the boys. We have recently been requested by the colored women of our city to as sist them in organize a W. C. T. U. and we have taken steps toward ac complishing this work at an early day. We have not been able to further the good cause of Temperance to the extent that we desire, yet we trust that He who '-seeth not as man seeth" and who accepteth "accord ing to that a man hath, and not ac cording to that he hath not," has blessed our humble efforts and will bless us, yet more abundantly. Mrs. M. West, President. Mrs. C. A. Henly, Secretary. The Philadelphia Press (Rep.) says, "the building of a navy and the rehabilitation of American shipping interest cannot be delayed longer," just so, and that's the rea son the "sixty million people" you spoke so confidently about, decided last year that a change must take place in the government,—see ?
