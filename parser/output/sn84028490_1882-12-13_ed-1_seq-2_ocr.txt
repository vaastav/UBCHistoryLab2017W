The Tariff Commission, though strong for reduction, find the existing tariff so full of abominations, that they recom mend 20 per cent reduction, and in some rases more. This is a confession worthy of consid eration and remembering. Here are tariff men admitting the iniquity that has been oppressing the people, and that the Democratic party has been de nouncing as a swindle for long years, The President says: There has been substantial accord the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as are necessary for a wise and economical administration of the Government. He also declares: that all internal taxes save those that relate to distilled spirits can be prudently abrogated, and that alter tnis large reductions irom tne cus toms revenue are entirely leasiDier All this is just what Democrats have been claiming. President Arthur evi dently believes In "a tariff for revenue only. Is Congress goes at it to curtail taxa tion one hundred millions a year, the question will be, where to cut down The favored capitalists will try and in timidate Congress, so as to hold on to their bounties. Already comes a des patch from St. Louis, setting forth that the largest tobacco factory in that city has been closed, and that 4,000 people are likely to, be thrown ont of employ ment, "owing to the agitation in Con- "gress of questions connected with the "tobacco tax." If Congress la going to reduce, the less delay the better. The Republican party la now reduced to the necessity of undoing its own work; and it knows not where to begin, though ad mitting the necessity. The Supreme Court of the United States has just decided the long con troversy and litigation about the well known Arlington estate, opposite Wash ington, awarding the estate to the heirs of General Robert B. Lee's wife. Of cour they do not propose to occupy it, as it is used as a Government cemetery and a sad place it is and for other public purposes, but will relinquish their rights on a Just compensation for the property. The Supreme Court bases its decision on the constitutional pro visions that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without dne process of law, nor private property, taken for public use. without just com pensation. A minority of the Justices dissented. Including Chief Jnstlee Walt and Jus tices Gray, Bradley nd Woods. 

REDUCING TAXES, Seems to be agreed upon all round, but we observe great diversity of opinion among Congressmen. Some would have a curtailment of receipts brought about exclusively by a lowering of tariff du ties; Mr. Folger, in his Treasury report, wonld cut down the in ternal revenue to some extent, yet wonld make changes in the tariff the principal source of shrinkage; while the President recommends that all internal taxes, save those imposed upon distilled spirits, be abolished, and, at the same time (not perceiving, apparently, the Incompatibility of his suggestions,) that the tariff be so revt-ted as to enlarge the free list, and to sensibly reduce the du ties on other articles. Whatever is done, the curtailment should be suffi cient This thing of a large surplus of revenue is all wrong, oppressing the people and endangering business. According to Secretary Folger, the to-, tal revenue of the Federal Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883, will be 1415,000,000. The total ex pendi tures, including the provision for the sinking fund, and .the payments on ac count of the pension swindle, will be in round numbers f 339,412,000. This should give at the end of the curren fiscal year a surplus of 75,578,000. This session of Congress must provide for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1883, and if no curtailment of taxes should be made, a similar surplus would come the next fiscal year. The trouble is, that an over-abund inee of money In the Treasury leads to all manner of jobs and corruption. We hope to see thor ough reform. Cut down the revenues; cnrtall expenses; compel economy in all directions. This government was not formed to benefit a few persons and rob the masses of the people; but to "estab lish justice and secure the blessings of liberty." This means equal opportuni ties and equal taxation. If the present Congress could manage to exhibit an unhesitating devotion solely to the best interests of the country. together with a marvellous capacity for the swift transaction of business, it might wind up its career with a per fect boom. The stars would then be propitious. Repository. "If I" It Is difficult to learn old dogs new tricks; and equally difficult for po litical leaders to abandon old ways and adopt new and better modes. Men ac customed in public affairs to consult only their own and Individual interests instead of the public good, are not likely to bout face and become unselfish in their political action. No doubt, such sham 'statesmen as Secor Robeson, Chandler, Keifer, Page, Jay Hubbell, and the rest, have had a terrible lesson from the people; and they would like to allay the storm. In this view they are ready to adopt sur reptitious ways, and resort to craft rather than adopt honest, straight for ward action. Such moderate reductions of taxation as they dare not resist, they will try to adji.'st so as to serve the inter ests of the large manufacturers whose pecuniary contributions have heretofore been useful to the Republican party, and so as to leave undiminished the huge army of office holders by whose assessments campaign funds are creat ed. There are still about two years to Intervene before the next Presidential election, and "practical politicians" of the Robeson and Hubbell type will do their utmost to prevent any serious im pairment' of the resources from which they expect to draw the sinews of war, . The disrepntable element in the Re publican party will not favor any great salutary reform such as is recommended in the President's message. The leaders think they would utterly ruin the party, As indicated by later dispatches ves terday, the State Canvassing Board has changed its decision somewhat relative to tne returns irom tne various uon- f reesional districts. In the Eighteenth be five votes returned from Columbiana connty for Jonathan Wallace, and also the two votes returned for J. H. Wallace, as for Jonathan H. Wallace, leaving Mo Kinley a majority of one in the district, thus awarding him the certificate of election. It is stated that the Board is still in doubt as to its alleged judicial functions, but nave so far resolved this doubt as to count the votes having the initial letter or tne christian nam's of the several candidates. In this, possibly, the Board has slightly exceeded the scope of its ministerial duties, so far, at least, as to taxe cognizance, to a limited extent, or wnat judge rnurman desig nates as the presumptive evidence in the case, not going so far, however, as to connt votes which manifestly would require substantiating evidence to make the intent of the voter clear. But as yet we see no reason wny me Board snouid not have adhered towhat was announced as its first decision. Repository, 9th. Of course the Rep. would prefer eight should have been the declared majority rather than one. And, truly, when the Board opened the door and was governed in their action by the plain Jntent of the voter, it is difficult to see how they could stop where they did. The votes for "Major Wallace" and for "Maj. Wal lace" were plainly intended for- Jona than H. Wallace, for his nsual cognomen in Columbiana county is "Major Wal lace." By this he is known and con stantly sainted. By this ruling the Board counted in also Mnrray and War ner, Democrats, and Moray, Republican. New Jersej Premium Wine.

TAXATION AND WHO OPPOSE ITS REDUCTION. The vote In the Committee on Ways and Means last week is an answer to the suppositions of the Republican press and Washington specials, that the Dem ocrats will impede the reduction of taxation at this session. The vote in Committee, on reporting a bill repeal ing every form of the tax on tobacco, one of the most oppressive and unequal of the Internal taxes, stood six to five, four Democrats and two Republicans voting for repeal, and four Republicans and one Democrat against. Mr. Morri son of Illinois, was the only Democrat against repeal, and he is an advanced revenue reformer, and Insists on modi fying the tariff, making "substantial reductions," as Arthur and Foiger rec ommend, before cutting down internal taxation. Messrs. Randall and Carlisle the leading Democratic candidates for the Speakership, both supported the re pealing bill. If .this vote'in Committee is indica tive of the sentiment in Congress, the Republican majority twi 11 not reduce taxation much thfs session. The trouble Is they would thus, dismiss a couple of thousands of useless officials, and that they don't want, nor do the officeholders want it. President Arthur says if all the internal. taxes but that on whisky are cutoff, two and a half millions can be saved on the expenses of the revenue bureau, and 1,500 or 2,000 useless offl cials be retired from office. Gen. Garfield some years ago, in discussing the reduc tion of public expenditures, said it con id only be done effectively by a party in opposition to that having possession of the executive departments of the Gov ernment. All this, therefore, will probably be left for the Democratic pru ning knife, as intimated by Genera Garfield. Swindlers Abroad.
