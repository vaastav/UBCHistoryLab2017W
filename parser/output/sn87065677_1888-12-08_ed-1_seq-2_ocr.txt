Premising, ' that this treatment is at once compre hensive, laid upon broad lines, speci fic, and aggressive, and fhat the President reinforces his former po sition with positiveness and great ability ; and that the echoes of these and other brave nnd patriotic words of the rething President will sound alpng the line whereon the many are contending with the organized and powerful few for years to come. To the Congress of the United States: As yon assemble fot the discharge of ihe duties you have as sumed as the representatives of a free and generous people, your meet ing is marked by an interesting and impressive fhcident.

SURVIVAL toil ONE HUNDRED .... YE AK3. is not sufficient to assure us that we no longer have danger to fear in the maintenance, with all its promised blessing, of a government founded upon the freedom of the people. The time rather admonishes us to soberly inquire w hether in the past we have alwajs closely kept in the course of safety, and whether we have before us a way plain and clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity. When the experiment of onr gov crment was undei taken,' the chert adopted for our guidance was the constitution. Depaituie fiom the lines there laid down is failuv . It is only by a strict- adherence to the direction they indicate, and by res traint within the limitations they lix, that we can furnish proof to the world of ihe fitness of the American people for self-government. The equal justice of which we boast as the underlying principle of our in tituUons should not be confined to the relations of our citizens to each other. THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF. is under bond to the Ameiican people that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will deal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest aud fair and ab solutely just. It has agieed that American citizenship shall be the only credential necessary lo justify the claim of equality before the law, and that no coudition in life shall give lise to discrimination in the treatment of the people by their govemmen. The citizen of our Republic in its early days ligidly insisted upon full compliance with the letter of this bond, and saw stietching out before him a clear Held of individual endeavor. His tribute to the support of his govern mcnt was measured by the (ostof us economical maintaix ACE j tt8K tne nenate to proceed with that and he wns secure in the enjoyment j ""amess on Tuesday. Chandler de of the remaining recompense of his j shed io give noi.'ee lhat as soon as prac liberty and couteuted to it- In those days the frugality of the people was stamped upon their gov ernment, and was enforced by the free thoughtful intelligent suffrage of the citizen. Combinations, mo nopolies and aggregations of capital I were either avoided or sternly regu i late 1 and restrained. The pomp and glitter of governments less free ff ril nrt fnrnt ut tan an1 nrnannf. . ed no delusion to the plain people, I w" airte h' Bi(ie in friendly compe- li-tio? ,ou?ht for-the enoblement Ulignity of man, for the solution of j tl p0,,,,m o'free governmenti and j for the achievement of of the grand i destiny awaiting the laud which God ! had given them. The farmer's sons, not Satisfied with his father's simple and labori ous life, joins the eager chase for easily acquired wealth. We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the reward of honest industry and elightened foresight, but that they result from the discriminating favor of the government, and are largely built upon undue exactions from the masses of onr people. The gulf be tween employers and the employed ii constantly widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, while in anothei are found THE toilinu POOR.

TARIFF BATES., ! , . - . There should be no cessation of the struggle tiutil the plan is per fected, fair and conservative, toward existing industries, but which will' reduce the oost of the necessaries of life; while it provides for our manu facturers (he advantage of freer Taw materials and "permits no injuries to the interests of American latior. - The cause for which the battle is waged is sompiiscd within lines clearly and distinctly denned; it should never be compromised, it is 'Ae people's cause. It cannot be denied that the selfish and private ihteiests which are so persistently heard, when efforts are made to deal in a just aud compre hensive manner with OCR TAl.IFF LAW'S are re'ated to, if they ttrc not respon sible for, the se'itiinent largely pre vailing among the people lhat the geneial government is the fountain of individual and private aid; that it may be expected to le'ieve with paterual care the distress of citueas aud communities, and that from the fu'lness of its deasury it should, rpon the slightest pretext of pro moting the geneial good, apply pub lic funds to the benefit of localities and individuals. Nor can it be de nied that there is a growing assump tion that, as against the govern ment and in favor of private claims and interests, ti e usual rules aud limitations of business principles just dealing should be waived. - THESE IDEAS have been unhappily much encour aged by legislative acquiescence. The last session of the 50th Con gress met on Monday The Senate, after the reception of the Presidents message, referred to the unfinished business, which was the Tariff bill. ! Mr- Allison announced that he would licable he would ask that the resolu tion to investigate the election in Louis iana last Apiil be disposed of: That he suspected that there would be no objection. Mr. Gibsoji, said he had strenuously objected to the consider ation of that resolution and would continue to lo so. THE

I have to say that I am surpris ed at the report mentioned by you, and must attribute its circulation to willful malice, as it has no founda tion in fact. So far from supporting this Bill I introduced II. B. No $22 ia opposition : to it and , urged , its passage ia a speech, but it was de feated. This I think was due to the confusion usual just before adjourn ment, nnd to the fact (hat the other i bill was reported by the V ays and Means Committee,- had its powerful support; and was not properly con sidered by the House. I never did believe . that the Legislature could equalize assessments of property and give satisfaction. '" But on the con trary, my idea is that every man's property should be , assessed at 'tis rnvn mlw, without regsird to his neighbor's and my bill was aimed in this direction, and designed to se cure the just assessment of the property of all tax-payers, aud thus 'qualiz th burden of taxation. I have the bill I offered, now in my possession; and have also letters from members of the House, receiv ed since my return commending ' it and regretting its failnre to pass, i The bill that did puss is copied from a law of 1840, and after one assessment was . made under it,; it was repealed w ithout a dessenting vote, and 1 predict a similar fate for the present law. Yours Respectfully. J II.
