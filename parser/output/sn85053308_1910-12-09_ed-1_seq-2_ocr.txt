TAFT MESSAGE PRESIDENT POINTS OUT NECES SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN SES TO LAWMAKERS. ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For tification of Panama Canal Lead ing Topics Discussed—Has Little to Say About Tariff. Washington, Dec. 6.—Economy In government affairs is the keynote of President Taft's annual message read before both houses of congress today. The message approximates 40,000 words and is one of the longest ever submitted by a president. Conservation of the public domain, ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana ma canal and the continuation of the present tariff board are the leading subjects touched upon. He also re views the work of the various gov ernment departments and concurs in recommendation, tending toward the bettering of the service, made by sev eral of the members of his cabinet. Economy Is Urged. In dwelling on the urgent need for economy in government expenditures, the president says: "Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1912. I say this in order that congress may understand that these estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will maintain the departments, bureaus and offices of the government and meet its other obligations under existing law, and that a cut of these estimates would re sult in embarrassing the executive branch of the government in the performance of Its duties. This remark does not apply to tlie river and harbor estimates, except to those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under author ized contracts, nor does it apply to the public building bill nor to the navy build ing program. Of course, as to these con gress could withhold any part or all of the estimates for them without interfer ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob ligations of these functions of its depart ments. bureaus and offices. "Against the estimates of expenditures $640,494,013.12, we have estimated receipts for next year $630,000,000, making a proba ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or dinary expenditures of about $50,000,000, or taking into account the estimates for the Panama canal, which arc $56,920,847.69, and which will ultimately be paid in bonds, it will leave a deficit for the next year of about $7,000,000, if congress shall conclude to fortify the canal." Wants Forest Limitation Removed. On the subject of conservation he de votes considerable space to forest, coal, oil and gas, phosphate lands and water power sites. As to the reservation of forest lands he says: "The law now pro hibits the reservation of any more forest lands in Oregon. Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except by act of congress. I am informed by the department of agriculture that the gov ernment owns other tracts of timber land In these states which should be included In the' forest reserves. I recommend to congress that the limitation herein im posed be repealed. "Congress ought to trust the executive to use the power of reservation only with respect to land most valuable for forest purposes. During the present administra tion. 62.250.000 acres of land largely non timbered have been excluded from forest reserves, and 3,500.000 acres of land prin cipally valuable for forest purposes have been included in forest reserves, making a reduction in forest reserves of non timbered land amounting to 2,750,000 acres." Wants Canal Fortified. Regarding the Panama canal, the presi dent asserts that unless unexpected ob stacles arise the waterway will he com pleted well within time limit of Janu ary 1. 1915, and within estimate of cost, $375,000,000. Suggestions for levying of tolls and management are made, and re garding fortification of the canal, he says: "Among questions arising for present solution is the decision whether the canal shall be fortified. I have already stated to (he congress that I strongly favor for tification and I now reiterate this opin ion and ask your consideration of the subject in the light of the report already before you made by a competent board. "Failure to fortify the canal would leave the attainment of both these aims In the position of rights and obligations which we should be powerless to enforce and which could never in any way be ab solutely safeguarded against a desperate and irresponsible enemy." Ship Subsidy. The president urges such action as he believes will increase American trade abroad, and says:: "Another instrumentality Indispensable to the unhampered and natural develop ment of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and commercial na tions recognize the importance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for rapid and direct mail, pas senger and freight communication quite so urgent as between the United States and I.atin America. We can secure in no other quarter of the world such imme diate benefits in friendship and com merce as would flow from the establish ment of direct lines of communication with the countries of Latin America ade quate to meet the requirements of a rap idly increasing appreciation of tile reci procal dependence of the countries of the western hemisphere upon each other's products, sympathies and assistance. "I alluded to this most important sub ject in my last annual message: It has often been before you and I need not re capitulate the reasons for Its recommen dation. Unless prompt action be taken tiie completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great commercial na tion unable to avail in international mari time business of tills great contribution to tiie means of the world's commercial In tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff. In the space devoted to tiie tariff th* president says: "The schedules of tiie rates of duty In tho Payne tariff act have been subjected to a great deal of criticism, some of it just, more of it unfounded, and too much misrepresentation. The act was adopted in pursuance of a declaration by the par ty which is responsible for it that cus toms bill should be a tariff for the pro tection of home Industries, tho measure of tiie protection to be the difference be tween the cost of producing the imported article abroad and the cost of producing it at homo, together with such addition to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to tiie home producer. Tiie basis for the criticism of this tariff is that In respect to a number of tiie schedules tiie declared measure was not followed, but a higher difference retained or Inserted by way of undue discrimination in favor of certain industries and manufactures. Lit tle, if any. of tho criticism of the tariff i has been directed against the protective j principle above stated; but the main body I of tlie criticism has been based on the at- 1 tempt to conform to the measure of pro tection was not honestly and sincerely adhered to." Tiie president also refers to tiie appoint ment of a board of experts to investigate tiie cost of production of various articles included in tiie schedules of tiie tariff, and concludes: "Whether or not tiie protective policy is to be continued, and the degree of protec tion to be accorded to our home indus tries, are questions which the people must decide through their chosen representa- i tives. But whatever policy is adopted. It I is clear that tiie necessary legislation should ho based on an impartial, thor ough and continuous study of the facts." Recommends Parcels Post. Tiie adoption of the parcels post is again adopted. On tills subject President Taft says: "With respect to tiie parcels post, I respectfully recommend its adop tion on all rural delivery routes, and that 11 pounds—the international limit—be made tiie limit of carriage in such post. The same argument is made against tiie parcels post that was made against tiie postal savings bank—that it is introduc ing tiie government into a business which should lie conducted by private persons and is paternalism. Tiie postofflee depart ment lias a great plant and a great or ganization, reaching into the most remott* hamlet of tiie United States, and with tills machinery it is able to do a great many things economically that if a new organization were necessary it would be impossible to do without extravagant ex penditures." Department of Justice. Discussing the affairs of the department of justice, tin- president says: "I invite especial attention to tile prose cutions under the federal law of tiie so called 'bucket shops,' and of those schemes to defraud in which the use of tiie mail is an essential part of tiie fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which have saved ignorant and weak members of tiie public and arc saving them hun dreds of millions of dollars. The viola tions of tiie anti-trust law present per haps the most important litigation before tiie department, and the number of cases filed shows the activity of the govern- , merit in enforcing that statute. "In a special message last year I brought to the attention of congress tho 1 propriety and wisdom of enacting a gori- I eral law providing for tiie incorporation ! of industrial and other companies engaged in interstate commerce, and I renew my recommendation in that behalf." Tiie crying need in the United States of cheapening tiie cost of litigation by simplifying judicial procedure and ex pediting final judgment is pointed out and action looking to correction of these evils is urged. The president recommends an increase In the salaries of federal judges. Postal Affairs. In regard to postal matters the presl dent points with pride to its present effi cient management and the recent reduc tion in the deficit. The present unre stricted franking privilege comes in for comment with a suggestion for tiie adop tion of better methods for its regulation. Abolish Navy Yards. The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by the secretary of tin navy which he recommends for adoption, and continues: "The secretary of tiie navy has given personal examination to every navy yard, and has studied tiie uses of the navy yards with reference to the necessities j of our fleet. With a fleet considerably I less than half the size of that of the | British navy, we have shipyards more than double the number, Ttnd there are several of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern mchinery, which, after investigation the secretary of the navy believes to be entirely useless for naval purposes. He asks authority to abandon certain of them and to move their machinery to other places, where it can be made of use." Speaking of our foreign relations the president says: "During the past year the foreign relations of the United States have continued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. "The year has been notable as witness ing tiie pacific settlement of two impor tant international controversies before the permanent court of Tiie Hague. "The arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond-* ence since the fisheries convention of 

ISIS, has given an award which is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration is par ticularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently just results secured, but also because it is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4, 1908, between the United States and Great Britain, and disposes of a con troversy the settlement of which has re sisted every other resource of diplomacy and which for nearly ninety years has been the cause of friction between two countries whose common interest lies in maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations with each other. President Taft makes a few recommen dations for changes in the Interstate com merce law and says: "Except as above, I do not recommend any amendment to the Interstate com merce law as it stands. I do not now recommend any amendment to the anti trust law. In other words, it seems to me that the existing legislation with reference to the regulation of corpora tions and the restraint of their business has reached a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous execution of the laws of the statute books In restraining the abuses which certainly did exist and whiah roused the public to demand reform." j | j $3.50
