BB ' The Presidents disapproval killed tho If measure nt that session; but, as Its fuuda II' mental principle had received the sane BH t I ' tlon of each house, It a certain to bo BwV I revived, and this has now been done In the Hf ' i Benatp. It w ill ho conceded, wti suppose, iBjf ' that the reading and writing test is not an mlui f Weal test. As a former Commissioner fill V General put it, "tho illiterate Immlgruiit PlBs B Is not nlwns to be considered an undeslr EIM1 U ' nccos'ou to ollr population, since ho JnW 'l often prou's a nioro honest, Industrious, Wm f nd thrifty citiren than many who come U, , )' equipped with money and an education."

A severe penalty, reaching a maximum of fSOO flno and a year's Imprisonment,' was Imposed on tho employee and the em ployer for violating thlK provision. "VVhatover tho merits of the alien labor restriction, It evidently had nothing to do with Illiteracy. Slnco It was aimed at Ca nadians who cross tho border for dally la bor In tho United States, It provoked, last winter, irreat 111 feeling In the Dominion and various projects of retaliation. It Is obvious that somo persons who favor tho Illiteracy measure, do not liko tho other, and also that each should stand on Us own merits. Wo bellovc, therefore, that a suc cessful effort will be made to keep out any such Canadian labor measure from the pending Illiteracy bill. As to this latter thero Is something to be said, as wo havo already Intimated, on both sides; but slnco general rules must be adopted, It seems probablo that an Illit eracy restriction of somo sort will bo Im posed. Provision for adequate notice ot lta taking effect would help to avoid hard ships In turning book Immigrants who might risk entranco when disqualified, whllo tho steamship companies that have largo pecuniary Interests In bringing over Immigrants may stir themselves to have tho Illiterate taught to read and write. For tho Salco of Humanity. Mayor Strono's plan for funeral cere monies over the Xew York which will pass away on tho first of next month In cludes three solemnnnd mournful memorial addresses. One Is to recite the history of tho deceased up to the time of the Revolution. Tho second is to tako up the story and carry It down to tho moment ot tho dis solution of tho departed, closing, of course, with a fitting trlbuto to tho last Mayor. A third will present facts and figures show ing tho commercial activity of tho lamented municipality. The proceedings at the wake, accord ingly, are to bo made as depressing as pos sible, and that any citizens who desire to begin the Now Year with such cruel self mortification may bo properly accommo dated, Mayor Stiioxo wants the doleful exercises to tako nlaco In a hall large enough to hold them all. There would bo no difficulty In finding a hall sufficiently spacious for the purposes ot a mortuary chapel, but If no other place is handy any room big enough to hold tho three orators will do. Less suffering will be caused to the community the smaller It Is. The most humane plan would be for the orators to read to a typewriter only their extracts from tho cyclopaedias and the statistical reports of the Chamber of Com merce, for Mayor Strong's scheme Includes the embalming of their dreariness " In a volume that will bo valued more a hun dred years henco than nt present." The sympathies of this generation cannot ex tend to their successors of a century hence so keenly that they will feel called upon to spare them such an Infliction. So long as they themselves escape from It they will leave their descendants to look out for themselves. A hundred years from now, too, there may be a curious Interest In looking back to tho proceedings of this wake conducted by the last and goutiest Mayor of tho nucleus of the greatest and most powerful capital of tho world. This memorial volume will contain, of course, portraits ot all the leading Mug wumps of Manhattan Island. They con be printed from tho old plates used In the self celebration of the Committee of Seventy's prowess In obtaining public offices, or In other volumes in which Mugwumps have perpetuated their features for the admira tion of posterity. Doubtless tho pictured Mugwumps would pay tho cost and feel themsolves amDlv recamnensed bv thn &rl. vertlsement. All this, as we havo Intimated, can be done without casting Incongruous gloom over tho festivities of the opening day of the new year. Mayor Stiionq's company of mourners can thus preserve tho tears they shed in tho privacy of their own cham bers, and there will be no sound of jarring hilarity to Interfere- with their enjoyment ot the luxury of woe. Meanwhile, the rest of the public can proceed to celebrate the day liko rational human beings. Anyway, for heaven's sake, spare us the actual public do! ivory of the three dreadful orations I Government Ducks and Goose. Administrations change, but the Depart ment of Agriculture never ceases Its benefi cent work. Farmers' Bulletin No. 04 treats of "Ducks and Geese; Standard Breeds and Management." It Is the sixty fourth gift of the Government to the farmer. Ho must bo as rich now in pocket as tho Department of Agriculture Is In wisdom. It seems that tho season for raising ducks is from February to July. The rest of the year farmers can raise ostriches, pocket gophers, woodpeckera, and other friends of tho Government. There Is u.oney In ducks, as the Department of Agriculture says : "Duck raising Is to be recommended to farmer, aa aprofltablo eourceof rerenuei and by careful atten tion to the work, as knowledge Increases, the scope of the Industry majr lie extended. There are numbers of farms lu tills country to-day that are deroted ez oluiWely to raising ducks, areragltig from 0,000 to 0,000 ducks as an annual output. An Idea of the proportions of the business may be had from the fact that as high as three tons ot feed are used dally by a single raiser during the busy season. The profits are the rery best, and good Incomes may be made when once the buslniss Is thoroughly mastered," Still, tho department is prudent. Wo cannot all raise ducks, at least, not with out dust and heat, " Duck raising Is an arduous task ; one that requires an appren ticeship and absolute knowledge ot the business before success Is reached. Those who have been successful In raising ducks have learned their business much as one does any other vocation." Doubtless all vocations could bo learned easily and cheaply If the Government were properly encyclopedic and diffused sufficiently Its activity aud its bulletins. The remarks about ducks and tho pic tures of ducks in liulletln No. 04 are of rare interest and beauty, but when tho De partment of Agriculture talks about geese It speaks with authority almost autobio graphical. Tho barn door Is wldo open. With bowed head tho Government gooso waddles out and on: "While the goose cannot profitably he raised In aa large numbers as the duck, still It cannot Justly be termed unprofitable. There are many plaoes on a (arm that are worthless for culUratlou that could be utilised with excellent results for goose raising. Held, that bare streams, branches, or unused springs on them could be turned to good adrantage by mak ing them Into goose pastures. Many farmers are profiting by this and adding to their Incomes annu ally, The care and attention necessary (or raising ..I,.,,, ,,, i e jisj. . ,i Hi . ".

In sects and other animal and vegetable matter to be found in the fields and brooka." Tho most rigid adherents of the Individ ualistic theory of government cannot but feel a weakening of tho knees as ho finds tho Department of Agriculture shovelling out goose feed in this fashion : "To fatten young geese, plaoe them In a pen, not too large, so that they will not exercise too muoh. and feed three times a day all they will eat up clean of the following- Corn meal mixed to a dry orumbly tate and beef scraps amounting to 0 per cent, ot the bulk of the corn meal. While fattening young geese they should be kept aa unlet a possible no ex citement whatever should disturb them. When (ced ing approach thorn quietly, and do not Irritate them In the-least or rney wm uw, .., "... .. out' or grow another crop of feathers. At ten week of age, or when the tips of the wings reach the tall. they are ready for market, and should weigh between eight and ten pounds." This kindly care of tho Government for anserine hygiene, this beautiful devotion to the nervous system ot tho gosling, will make Farmers' Bulletin No. 04 famous among the documents of humanity. No good man will consciously Irritate a young goose. No friend of man or geese will do anything to promote neurasthenia. No chcnoboscologer who respects himself and tho Department of Agriculture will allow any gooso over which ho has control to tako too much exercise. A gooso with an athletic heart Is not one to bo desired. Probably tho Emperor William II. would bo content to tell his awed subjects how to raiso geese. Our wide-ranging paternal Government tolls the goose-grower how to mako Incision Into tho bird ot wis dom and how to strip him : "When young goslings are to be dressed (or market they are killed by cutting them In the root of the mouth, severing the artery, or by stunning them by hitting them a sharp, quick blow on the head. The picker uses a box In front ot htm about the height ot the knees, holding the bird wltb the left band and olasplng the feet and wings together; ho places the head of the bird against the box and holds It In place with the knee, rick the feathers from the body of the bird, then dampen the right hand and brush the body to remove the down. Leave about two Inches ot feathers on the neck, and also leave feathers on the wings at the drat joint. Lay the wings against the body of the birds and tie a string around to hold In position. Place the birds, when picked. In cold water (or an hour or so to plump them; It they are In the water too long they are liable to bleach and be come water soaked." Tho only defect In this valuable treatise Is Its failure to give minute directions as to the carving of a goose. Is It too late to get out a second edition before Christmas ? Rest rioting; Labor by Law. The Fall River cotton manufacturers havo announced a 10 per cent, reduction In the wages of their hands, to tako effect Jan. 1 next. The reduction, it is said, has been made necessary by the reduction In the price of cotton goods, partly caused by overproduction, but more by the competi tion ot the cotton factories recently estab lished at the South. The wages paid at the South are less and the hours of labor aro longer. In New England tho law for bids tho workmen In a cotton factory to work more than sixty hours a week, while at tho South ho Is subject to no limit what ever. For this reason, aud because of lighter taxation, a pound of material that in New England costs 0 cents a pound, can be produced at the South for 32 cents. A Blmilsx contrast exists between the cost ot producing machinery in Great Britain and that of producing it In Ger many. In Great Britain machinists work nine hours a day and six days In tho week ; In Germany they work eleven hours a day and seven days in the week. The conse quence Is that the German machine shops undersell the British In spite of tho supe rior skill and Intelligence of the British workman, which, to some extent, make up for his fewer hours of labor. Lately, however, the shop-owners resolved to tell their men that It they are to keep them at work they must got more work out of them forthe wages theypay. Tho work men, combined in an association called the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, are resisting this demand, and havo struck for eight hours a day. Pending tho dispute the employers have suspended operations, letting their shops stand Idle, and the deadlock thus created has lasted now for several months, with no prospect of a speedy end. Back of the question of hours lies that of the recognition of the rules of the Society by the employers, which, also, has relation to tho limitation and tho efficiency of labor. "Wo have, thus, both in this country and In Great Britain, Illustrations of tho ob stacles which are encountered by efforts to ameliorate the condition of worklngmcn by law or by combinations having tho force of law. If the whole civilized world were one great nation, and If natural con ditions were uniform everywhere In It, things might be so regulated as to estab lish everywhere uniform wages and hours of labor. With, however, nations com peting with nations, and one section of a nation competing with another section, the problem Is a difficult one to solve. Stealing Peary's Ideas. Capt. O. N. Svkkdrup, who was one of Dr. Nakbbn's comnaulona on tho aleilim Journey across tho Inland ico of South Greenland, and, later, commanded tho Fram and brought her safely homo after Nan-bun left his vessol, has taken a creditable part In Arctic exploration, Tho fact, however, that he now proposes to occupy tho same Arctic Held of research In which Mr. Pkauy will renew his explorations, next year, Is a specleB of discourtesy that Is not common. Instances are rare where an explorer has undertaken to compete for tho samo geo graphical laurels with anothor explorer who had published his plans and was about to execute them, Capt. SvBnnitui Is annoyed by tho fact that his purpose has been criticised as dis courteous and almost unprecedented. He has Informed tho public that he recently wrote to Mr. PEAnv that he would not aim to reach the pole, but only to study the paleocrystlo Ico and explore the land masRcs In tho neighborhood of north Greenland. This Is, In fact, a large part of the work which Mr. Peaky himself pro poses to do. In his address to tho Hoyal Geographical Society, on Nov. 8, President Sir C. It. Maiikiiam said : "Mr. I'urt Intends to adopt the plan of taking Eskimo families up Smith bound and, with their aid, to discover the most northern land to the north of Greenland, Capt, Hvmuiu-r I, fitting out the Fram also with the Intention ot proceeding up Smith Sound and exploring the unknown part of the north coaat ot Greenland." It was Peaii Y who discovered and mapped the larger part of tho north coast ot Green laud and proved that tho lands further north were not a portion of the mainland but an archipelago. When he presented to tho American Geographical Society last winter this very region as the basis of bis operations for the next few years, the an- nouncoment had been widely mado that Capt. SvnriDnDP was to command tho Fram on a voyage of Investigation In a partot tho Arctlo ocean 1,200 to 1,000 miles from tho region whore Mr. Peaht Is to make his headquarters. It was not until after Puary's project was known In every civil lied land that SvEnnncr changod his plans and decided to rival, If ho could, the Ameri can explorer In tho flold tho latter had selected. Leading geographical Journals of Europe say that Capt. SVKnmitJP will provision tho Fram for four years, and take with him fifteen men and a largo supply ot dogs and sledges. Ho will go equipped for a long campaign on tho very ground that Peary will occupy. Explorers ore often compelled to give their plans tho widest publicity. It was necessary for Dr. Nansen to take the world Into his confidence In order to got the funds he needed for his last expedition. The samo necessity impelled Mr. Peaiiy, last winter, to unfold his project for future work and to, glvo his reasons for believing It fcaslblo and worth tho money It would cost to carry It out. What would tho Government of Norway, which gavo substantial aid to Nansen, havo thought of any man who might havo attempted to steal his Ideas and put a vessel Into tho Ice near the now Siberian Islands where Nanmin said he would enter tho frozen Beat Such an in dictment appears to fit Capt. Sv'ETtDnup In his relation to Mr. Peary's enterprise ; and yet Capt. Svbrdrup's Government is sup plying a lariso part of tho equipment that ho proposes to utilize. There Is reason to bellevo that Capt. Svbrdrup's proposed procedure 1b not re garded with favor among geographical authorities whoso approval all Arctlo ex plorers desire to enjoy. Throe Postal Savings Bnnlc Bills. A significant feature of the President's message was tho omission of any reference to tho postal savings bank Bchcmo. If tho establishment of a Bystem ot Gov ernment savings banks Is to bo a leading feature of the present Administration's pollry, as has been announced frequently but unauthoritative, Mr. McKinley'b si leuco on the subject Is singular. Nevertheless, on tho first and second days of the session not Ibsb than three elaborate bills for tho establishment ot a postal savings bank Byatem were Intro duced in Congress. One was intro duced In the Houso by Mr. Lorimer of Illi nois, another In the House by Mr. Bar tiioldt of Missouri, and ono in the Senate by Mr. Mason of Illinois. All of thesa gentlemen are ltepublicans. Tho Mason bill and the Lorimer bill are Identical. Mr. Bartholdt's measure re sembles the others In many particulars, but it differs respecting tho investments permitted. In all of tho bills the Treasurer of tho United States is tho custodian of the deposits, whilo tho Secretary ot tho Treas ury Is charged with the Investment. Tho Mason bill and tho Lorimer bill limit such Investments to United States bonds by preference, or, If Government bonds are not available for the purpose, to State, county aud municipal bonds under certain restrictions. Tho Bartholdt bill permits tho Secretary to lend the people's savings to national banks at not less than three per cent. Common to all the bills Is the provision that the rate of Interest to tho depositors In tho postal savings banks shall be two per cent., computed once a year. The proposition, then, is practically that the peoplo of tho United States shall bo allowed to lend their small savings to the Government at two per cent. Instead ot de positing them in savings banks which pay three, three and a half, or four per cent., that the Government may tako these small savings In bulk, and, if it has no bonds to sell, may lend to the banks at three per cent, or more, tho profit going to the Gov ernment, not to the depositors. There doesn't seem to be much In the scheme. The President Is wise in not com mitting himself to it. Tho Prize for Extraordinary Virtue. Uncle Billy Baker of Kansas, the Popu list statesman who represented the Sixth district In tho last Congress, Is receiving general and well-merited applause- for his financial record. Ho served during three terms, managed by strict economy and personal supervis ion oversmallcxpcnsostollvo in Washing ton almost wholly upon his mileage and postage and stationery allowances, saved and invested his salary, and retired from public llfo tho possessor of $17,000 as tho result of thrift and self-denial. Few Congressmen can say as much as that; but before finally awarding the Montyon prlzo to Uncle Billy Baker of Kansas, wo should like to havo his affidavit that he has never been within twelve feet of a ticker. The plan of tho Federation of Women's Clubs for tho protection ot tho Palisades Is to havo tho States of New York and New Jersey condemn enouith of tuo slope beneath the cliffs to prevent further defacement. They regard this meusure, In connection wltb tho control of riparian rights, as a practical method of ac complishing tho purpose in view. Certain it la that thoro Is llttlo likelihood of tho passage ot any bill for the acquisition ot the I'ullsndos region by tho Federal Government as a military reservation. It must bo remembered that tho present Palisades Commissioners, un pointed several years ago by Governor Morton and Governor Wkrtb, respectively, aro con fined by tho terms of tho statutes creating the two Commissions to tho Federal reservation project exclusively. The two States should take up tlio quostion on new llnou. If the Palisades are to be saved tlio work will have to be done at Trenton and at Al bany, not nt Washington. Ambition Is an estimable thing. Nobody can object to ambition when tho underlying in tention is worthy. Thero aro the people who renin a) s scrupulous to any "Between you and I" instoadof " Between ou ana mo." Who can help being fond of them I Ono's heart goes out tu these conscientious people. They know, If Mr. Lixdlky MunitAY did not, that " Be tween you and I" Is tho more elegant phrase. They aro beautifully sensitive, nnd possessed absolutely by tho dcslro to be nice In language. Theso alert nnd scrupulous spirits would novor say "I feel bad," or "Sho looked boautlful." They know better. As soon as say " I feel bad," they would say "I seen my duty and I done It" of course, an Indefensible locution. This suggests the question as betn een " Welsh rabbit" and " Welsh rarebit." Nothing Is more Interesting to the intelligence which Is qualified to bo particular, Mr. Thomas J. M unite v, an unexcelled authority, has investigated this ques tion thoroughly and with all loving care, and la an admirable monograph, just completed, has fixed upon Archbishop Then fit the guilt in volved In the mistaken form, " rarebit," now al most unl ersally and very irrltatingly employed upon American bills of (arc. The truth Is, Mr. Muiiiily points out, that Or. Tiit-NCH did not take the trouble to be correct, and that a host of his followers were willing to trouble themselves as little as he did, Tho worthy Archbishop was logician, and hi dalivered fctmaeU raadl- lr to Intuition arising- In a logical war. The name ot the dish was originally and Is really "rabbit," but It Is easy to see how the exas perating variation arose. Melted cheese poured over a bit ot toast may very reasonably be called a "rarebit," the Archbishop and others like him aid, but how In the world can It bo called a " rabbit I" Who ever heard of a cheese rabbit I Or of a toast rabbit I It will be seen at once that these reformers were essentially logicians and purists, with no particular senso of humor. It was probably only because they had othor and mora Important things to do that thoy did not correct the still prevailing Impres sions that an "Essex stile" Is a ditch, an "Essex Hon" a calf, a "Flold lane duok" a baked sheep's head, and a " Cape Cod turkey" a codOsh. Even BnAKisrsARB hns been ques tioned by sorlous persons superior to tho figures and whimsicalities of speech. It has been vig orously contended that lnstotd of "sermons In stones and books In tho running brooks" ho moan t to say "sermons In books and stones in the running brooks" certainly a much plainer proposition.

Miles, slnco his return from Europe, has made ahtrt work of two stories that were set afloat about him. One was that ho paid some extravagant sum, $500 or $750, for his stateroom. He really engaged an ordinary first class stateroom, but it was assigned, by some mistake, to a lady, and so another vaoant room was substituted, without any charge above the ordinary first-class passage. Another yarn represented the General as crowding Admiral Milleii out of tho Bucking ham Palaco Hotel in London. As a fact, both woro guestB of the British Qovcrnmcnt, and their names were placed, liko those ot other guests, ovor tho rooms they were to occupy. Gen.

Eighty of the men who loft Hull nnd Ottawa to work on tho Crow's Nest Pass Railroad durlnc the summer have just returned hero. They say thoy were treated very badly. Tho legal action threatened by the men against tho Canadian Pacific Railroad for mis representation, was compromised by tho com pany giving them freo transportation home and $0 each, which represented tho total payment made them for four months' labor on tho rail road.

He put the coin In the square hole, and also doposlted a bit of paper with his autograph. The example was contagious.

It he had but known It The error r. as a falluro to estimate the effect that mint have been produced upon tho enemy, aa well aa upon ourselves, by so much hard fighting. It was only necessary to hold our ground, trusting to the pluck and endurance of our men, and the victory would have been ours. It Is, I bollovc, not generally known that tho late den. Thomas W. Sweeny, U. S. A., took tho same vlow as does (Jen. Scholleld In regard to that Important battle. Oon. Sweeny. It will bo remembered, was tho ofllcor who prevallod upon Gen. Lyon to fight, when the latter lmd dolor mined to retreat, Seo Pockham's "I,)on and Missouri In 1801," rip. 320-7. and Woodward's " Llfo of Lyon," pp. 303-4. From a manuscript account ot otents prior and subsequent to the battlo of Wilson's Crook, which manuscript Is In my possession, and Is dated " March 1, 1804," dictated and slgnod by Ocn, Sweeny, ho sayBi About tne 1st or August, isol, we moved out on the Fayettovllle road, and struck the advance guard of the enemy at Dug spring, when, atter a sharp skirmish, compelling him to fall back, irn pursued him to McOuIla's store, twenty-six miles rrom Bprlcgtleld, where, on the morning of tho 4th of August, a council ot war was held which decided upon returning to Springfield. The enemy followed us as w fell back and took up a strong position on Wilson's Creek and oemmenced fortifying. On the 7th Oen. Lyon, after holding a council ot war. whloh I was nnable to attend, bad determined to retreat. Everything was ready and only waiting forthe order to move, when I went to bsadquartrrs and had alongconversat1nnwlthLyon.durlngv.blch, in as forcible lanuuege as I ooutd oommand, 1 pointed oat what I oonoelved would be the result of such a tep, and begged him to bold on for a little while onger. After giving various reasons why, in his opin ion, thoy should stand their ground and glvo tho enemy battle, Gon. Sweeny continued: In reply to a question as to what plan I would adopt, f told him I would wait patiently until the enemy got within easy distance, when 1 would march out andattack him, surprise him, If posslhlot that the chances were greatly In favor ot the attacking party. He thought w would be annihilated If we failed. I told him that I did not think so, that our llttlo army wascomposed of snchmatertal that It could not It demoralised, and even If w e wero defeated, wo would be In a better condition to retreat than we would If we failed to deliver a battle. Re decided to fight. After a description ot the battle of Wilson's Creek, the account concludes: The fight lasted two hours after Lyon's death, when the enemy entirely disappeared from the field. Ma- iorSturtrls, howover, having assumed command after von fell, determine 1 to retreat, and although aus tslned lu my opinion bv other onicers that thn enemy had abandoned the field, still sturels persisted In fall ing back on sprtngntld. 1 begged him not to think uf such a thing; that thn enemy wan dereated, the field in our possession, and all wo had to do was simply to remain where we were. "I was sntlsflod," Oen. Sweeny states, "thnt the enemy was out of ammunition, as numbers of our men wero suppltod, by my direction, with ammunition from tho cartridge boxes of tho dead and wounded on the Held, and I knew wo wero ns well provided wllh ammunition as thoy wero when tho fight commenced. "Still Sturgls Insisted on retrcntlng, under tho impression that the enemy had not yet brought bis resort on Into action.

PLOT. Its Motive Chagrin nnd Itevengnand Its Object Itepnbllrnn Disorganisation. To the EotToa or Tns But Mr: Allow mo to In quire why those gentlemen who recently led the re volt and defeat of the Republican party In New York and the State, and who claim to be organising on In dependent Republican party In opposition to the regu lar preexisting organization, which has had an un broken aud successful existence since Its formation nearly halt a century ago, do not take at once the shorter, moro direct, manly, and sure course of going over openly to tho Bryan Democracy. They oertolnly cannot hope to gain ascendancy for a new party In the Stato or nation or In a single Assembly or Con gress district In the State. Tho only effect the UllbolUnd-BrookDcld-Reld party can have will be to aid 10 to 1 free silver Popullstlo Democracy In more easily winning victories by diverting voters claiming to be Republicans from the regular to the Irregular Republican organisation. Perhaps there are a few misguided Republican voters who would throw away their votes as they did in an attempt to elect Beth Low Mayor, yet who. If tbo alternative were plaoed before them ot voting with the regular Republloan organisation or the Bryan Democracy wonld choose tho former. But It may be a part ot this scheme to hold such voters from possible Republican support, lest If there bo no third ticket In the flold they should cast them for the regular organlxaUon. Experience has proved that third parties aro hard to organise, and still more difficult of maintenance and suocess. The Republican party has never had a revolt against Its organisation beyond a great city, or possibly somo other local political division. The or ganisation has stood for principles, not men. Our po litical faith has undergone but few changes, and those Incident to changod oondltlona, and they have all been made Inside the party lines. It Is well known and understood that the recent attempt In the Greater New York election, whose renewal and extension to other districts have been feebly threatened, did not arise from any change In the party platform enunci ated at St, Louis In 1800, upon which It won the most Important victory In Its history, hut was purely of a personal charact-r, due to hostility to oertaln men who had helped to organize the party and had labored In season and out of season to maintain It through aood and evil report until It became a controlling party In tba nation. Without a murmur against Its platform of principles from any paper or Individual that sup ported McKlnley and Blaok, wllh their unparalleled majorities, we find pseudo-Republicans sound ing the bell ot alarm, demanding a reorganlcaUon, or rather a dliunlfjlng, disintegrating hostile Re publican organization, without assigning a single rational reason for It. They started their rovolt with querulous oomplalnts ooncernlng personal matters In which the country at large has not the slightest In terest. To speak plainly, because these leaders of faction and rovolt have run mad from a disappointed ambition for additional favors and publlo honors, all of which have been received by men at least equaUy competent and deserving, they are trying to disrupt the party. Tbelr unsatisfied ambition has ripened Into hate and revenge, to appease whloh they would sacrifice the Republican party and Its principles and turn the State and Union over to Bryanlsm, with Its new aud nndemocratlo Popullstlo principles and dis honest financial measures. It Wnltelaw Reld could hate got a Cabinet ornco and Ilrookfleld bad been male Collector of the Port of New York, and MUhol land Postmaster, they would have given liberally to build a monument to the memory of Thomas C. Piatt as the hero of the Republican party. The peaceful turtle dove would have sounded his praises from the very depths of our forests. Malice and disappointment being the evident mo tive of those would be disorganizes, no Republican believing In the principles of his party and hoping for Its success will I o found lending them sympathy or aid In their efforts to encourage Its division and destruction. If there were any such, It would be far more honorable for them to abandon the third party Idea and unlto at once with Tammany Hall and the Dcmocratlo party, It Is a suggestive fuct tbat both Mugwumps and Democrats strlko hands ugalnst Mr. l'liitt. It Is because they regard his policies and methods as dangerous to their onmmon cause. On the other hand, It Is worthy of remembrance that no I'lsappolnted demand for places by Mr. Platt or his friends hss ever made him a " kleker " or soured him against his party; hence he dislikes a "kicking" and sour Republican. Like all publlo men, bo has had his disappointments, but they never deterred him from his faithful, earnest, unfaltering support of his party. Its principles, aud candidates, MOKTICIUA Dec 10. C V.
