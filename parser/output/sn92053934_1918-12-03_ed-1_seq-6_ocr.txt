TUESDAY, DEI EMBER .1, 131S. The President's Message. 1n turning the ra;lroau question over to congress w ithout recommendation the president gave the leg 1:,!at:ve branch of the government something to think khout while he is away helping to unscramble inter- - national affairs. Compared with the broader problems of recon struction railway ownership is a mere detail, and yet we shall not be surprised if congress is persuaded that it has been handed the hot end of the poker. -There are a lot of members who would rather tackle the whole Versailles program than stake their poli- -tical future on c it tier side of the railroad question in th United States. The tone of the message indicate the weight of -. responsibility the presidnt feels in what he is about - to undertake. He is the first-Thief executive to leave American soil while holding office and he goes un dertaking a part immeasurably greater than, ever " before has fallen upon the shoulders of one man. -Having laid down the general principles for which a world war was fought he is now about to under : take to amplify and apply them so that there shall be r approximate equilibrium between nations. Until a - peace is signed he will be the center of powerful . contending forces which will call for almost super- human strength, Wisdom and foresight to resist and reconcile. The well being of millions of human be- - ings will be largely in his hands not-once, but many times in the course of the deliberations. It is small '.wonder if the weight of impending event bore heav ily upon him when he penned his annual message. - As for congress it need not feci slighted because it will not be officially represented at the opening of . the peace conference. It will have enough to do if it settles the railroad question and deals promptly and wisely with tfce many other strictly home problems. The senate will have its chance to consider inter national readjustments when the rough outlines Lave been tketched at Versailles. Until that is done it. may profitably give most of its attention to its Knitting. New York's experiment with real "fly cops" will be watched with interest by the rest of the coun try. It is conceded that they will give the city valu able advertising, even though they may be orna . mental, rather than useful otherwise. Until crooks 'adopt the practice of making their get-away in air planes it seems superfluous to provide policemen -with flying equipment. Brave, But Also Sensible. In the later s'atr"s of the war much was written tibout the alleged impatience of our troops with any movement for an armistice which might stop hostili ties before German Boil was invaded. We were told they would not bo satisfied unless they had a chance to visit upon the Germans some of the frightfulness that the latter bad wrought in France and Belgium. '-.ll that sounded fine, but we find now there wasn't much truth in it. American soldiers, we are now as tared on good authority, are Just as glad as anybody :hat our objectives were gained without more fight ing. They were ready to go on if necessary, but it was results, rather than glory or personal revenge, they were after. They are brave, but they also have r. lot of common sense. it is said that the ex-kaiser and the former crown frince had a falling out. which is somewhat surpris ing, since there is so little left for either to quarrel about. Probably the estimate made by an English fiuan- ial authority that the damage done by the Germans will foot up somi-tiiir.g over a trillion of dollars Is accurate enough for all practical purposes. What ever the total is, it is so much more than the Huns ever can pay that a few ciphers more or less will tjot make much differ nee. Results of Food Survey. commercial sto ks of wheat reported in a sur vey made by the department of agriculture as of November 1, 

ISIS, amounted to 274,025,910 bushels, is compared with lS5.9y7,S.'!3 bushels reported on Land in a similar survey for October 1. These fig ures n fer to stocks actually reported and do not reprtr.-"tit the total commercial stocks of the coun try, nor u- they include st'x ks ou farms. The stocks -epor'.-d for November were held by 12,."" firms t-'evator, warehouses, grain mills and wholesale j;ea!ers - tu ir hold.ngs being luore than two and one-half times the run k. held by them a year earlier, tine acteal percentage being 263 4 of the 1&I7 stock. The commercial visible supply figures, as pub l.hed by the Chicago board of trade for the nearest iate (November 2, 391) show 122,004,000 bushels it wheat as against 14,908,000 a year ago, and the torre; ponding 13 rad street figures for JS1S show 131,- 852,000 bushels as against 22.855,000 bushels for 1917. A very great relative increase in the commercial stocks of wheat on November 1, this year, as com pared with the same date of last year is shown by 'these figures, as well as by the results of the more extensive survey. The commercial stocks of other cereals reported for November 1, 1918, according to the department statement, wore as follows: Com, 17,123,734 bushels; oats, 79,775.204 bushels; barley, 34.462.597 bushels; rye, 15,123,135 bushels. These stocks rep resent the following percentages of the correspond ing stocks on November 1, 1917: Corn, 272.7 per cent; oats, 108.9 per cent; barley, 129.1 per cent; rye, 122 per cent. The commercial stocks of Hour and corn meal, as reported for the survey, were: Wheat flour, white, 5.384,839 barrels; whole-wheat and graham flour, 148,916 barrels; rye flour, 303.434 barrels; com flour, 51,756,346 pounds; corn meal, 69,299,044 I pounds; buckwheat flour, 5,129,979 pounds; mixed flour, 23.460,225 pounds. These stocks represent the following percentages of the stocks on hand a year ago: Wheat flour, white, 12S.1 per cent; whole wheat and graham flour, 300.4 per cent; rye flour, 176.5 per cent; corn meal, 224.4 per cent; buck wheat flour 137.1 per cent; mixed flour, 228.4 per cent. Dere Mable LOVE LETTERS OF A ROOKIE By EDWARD STREETER, Lieut 27th (N. Y.) Division. s (Copyright, 191S, by Frederic A. Stokes Company) The Argus extends fraternal greetings to B. C. Utecht, who has Just taken charge in editorial and I managerial capacity of the Rock Island Daily Union. He comes here from Fort Worth, Tex., with a long record of accomplishment in newspaper work. He will find, we may be sure, that the local field is worthy of his best endeavors. While he be comes president and general manager, the public will be glad to know that S. W. Searle, editor and publisher for a number of years, will still be vice president and will continue to be identified with the publication. We do not want Germans who come to this coun try to avoid paying their share of the Hun war debt. We are not sure we shall welcome any of them for a good many years. War losses already figure up 14,000,000, with Russia, France, Italy, Serbia, Greece and Turkey t'J hear from. It is possible the total will be close to 30,000,000, and this accounts only for casualties among men bearing arms. Death and permanent disability from starvation and disease may have taken an equal toll among civilian populations. Consider the sad case of William Waack, the for mer Davenport policeman, who plead guilty in fed eral court at Peoria admitting he transported whisky from Rock Island to Davenport, but claimed he was the victim of his friends who secreted the firewater in his auto without his knowledge or con sent. It was a mean trick, all right, and nobody but a Davenport policeman would have been so guileless as to fall for it. If New York city undertakes to give a fitting wel come to every fighting unit that disembarks there it will save money by letting the work out by con tract in advance and hiring its bands by the month. Dr. Liebknecht may be a Socialist, but his yield ing to a desire to sleep in the bed of the former kaiser certainly lays his radicalism open to suspicion. Might continues to make right In Russia.

DEDICATION To a million Private Bills who have suddenly learnt to call a coat a blouse. Taking things as they find them. Vaguely understanding. Caring less. Grumbling by custom, Cheer ful by nature. Ever anxious to be where they are not. Ever anxious to be somewhere else when they get there. Without thought of sac rifice. Who have left the flag-waving to those at home. Who serve as a matter of course. Need for An Army. Only a few weeks ago the opinion was commonly expressed in this country that the United States should never again be caught unprepared to defend itself adequately against any possible enemy. Yet at this moment, in the enthusiasm over the defeat of the Germans, there Is a tendency to throw over board without further ado all the war organization of the United States. Men in high places talk of peace as though it had been fully achieved and set tled, beyond the possibility of fracture, and they are eager to demobilize the army, rush the boys back from Europe, quit the production of war materials, and abolish all war rules affecting manufacture, food, agriculture, and commerce. The government agencies have yielded to this tendency to a con siderable extent, without waiting for the outcome of the war. Why is it assumed that the world has entered upon universal and blissful peace and brotherly love? What warrant is there for that assumption? Why do so many Americans jump to the conclusion that the cessation of shooting is the same thing as the permanent settlement of the world's' troubles? If they would contemplate the situation a little they would perhaps admit that the suspension of hostili ties does not by any means guarantee the complete and permanent settlement of the questions that have torn Europe to pieces and inflicted well nigh mortal blows upon many nations. War is an effort to attain a political object by the use of force. The political object is the thing desired, not the fighting. Is the political object of this war attained? Not yet. It must be pursued by mixed methods of force and negotiation. Negotia tion will become more important and force will play a minor role, if all goes well. But what if all does not go well? Who can guarantee that all the na tions of the world will lay aside their passions and cheerfully sarrifice their interests upon demand, for the eake of the general welfare? Is not that propo sition Just a little too heavenly for this wicked world? Washington Post, Dere Mable: I guess you thought I was dead. Youll never know how near you was to right. We got the tents up at last, though, so I got a minit to rite. I guess they choose these camps by mail order. The cnlyplaee there flat is on the map. Where our tents is would make a good place for a Rocky Mountin goat if he didnt break his neck. The first day the Captin came out an says "Pitch your tents here." Then be went to look for some one quick before anyone could ask him how. I wish I was a Captin. I guess he thought we was Alpine Chasers. Eh, Mable? But you probably dont know what those are. Honest, Mable, if Id put in the work I done last week on the Pan amah Canal it would have been workin long before it was. Of course there was a lot of fellos there with me but it seemed like all tLey did was to stand round and hand me shovels when I wore em out The Captin appresheates me though. The other day me watched me work awhile and then he says "Smith." He calls rtie Smith now. We got very friendly since I been nice to him. I noticed none ofihe ether fellos had much to say to him. I felt kind of sorry for him. Hes a human bein even if he is a Captin, Mable. So every time I raw him I used to stop him and talk to him. Democratic. Thats me all over, Mable. "Smith" he says "If ,they was all -. like you round here war would be hell, no joke." By which he meant that we would make it hot for the Boshes. I been feelin awful sorry for you, Mable. What with missin me and jour fathers liver gone back on him again things must have been awful lonesome for you. It isnt as if you was a girl what, had a lot of fellos hangin round all the time. Not that you couldnt have em, Mable, but you dont and theres no use makin no bones about it. If it hadnt been for me I guess things would have been pretty stupid though I dont begrudge you . a sent You know how I am with my money. I guess you ought to anyway. Eh, Mable? Never talk of money matters in connexun with a woman. Thats me all over. Now I got started an found a fcuntin pen an the Y. M. C. A. givin away paper like it does Im going to rite you regular. They say there goin to charge three sents for a let ter pretty soon. That aint goin to stop me though, Mable. There aint no power in heavin or earth, as the poets say, as can come be tween you and me, Mable. You mite send a few three sent stamps when you rite. That is if your fathers able to work yet. And willin, I should add. Of course it aint nothin to me but Id keep these letters what you get from me as a record of the war. Some day you can read em to your grandchildren an say "Your Grandfather Bill did all these things." Aint I the worst, Mable? Serious though I havnt found Ttoone so far what has thought of doin this except the newspapers. I guess 111 get a lot of '"nside stuff that theyll never see. So this may be the only one of its kind. But it doesnt matter to me what you do with them, Mable. Later 111 tell you all about every thing but I guess you wont under stand much cause its technickle. Lots of the fellos are gettin nitted things and candy and stuff right along. Dont pay no attenshun to that though, or take it for a hiit cause it aint I Just say it as mat ter of rekord. Independent if nothin. Thats me all over. Your3 till the war ends BILL. BY WILLIAM NOTEO , , PHYSICIAN AND BRADY M.D. AUTIjOff Why Sickness Selects the Poor. The most frequent type of illness, that due to the various respiratory infections and to complications and sequels of these Infections, pre vails chiefly among the poorer classes in cities, villages and the country. Why should sickness se lect the poor, who can scarcely af ford it, and pass by the well-to-do who probably would welcome it as a diversion and an excuse for dis play? To the thoughtless it might seem that the poor are not so well nour ished nor so warmly clothed nor so comfortably situated as regards household heating, as are the well- to-do classes, aud that these cir cumstances are the obvious ex planation of the more frequent ill nesses of the poor. As a matter of fact this is not so. In the exam ination of a large number of school children from all classes it is noticeable that the children of the poorer families are quite as well nourished as are children of well-to-do or middle class families, with the exception of cases of undernu trition dependent upon demon strable disease. And as a general rule one finds the very poor, who are usually the least intelligent people in the community, rather more overdressed than the average elI-to-do family for the poor have the catching cold phobia even more obstinately than the great middle class families. When it comes to the question of household heating, here Is where your washerwoman has it over your lazy parasite like a tent, for the de gree of warmth In the Inhabited portions of the home of the poor in cold weather is something posi tively sickening, and the warmth of the sleeping room particularly makes that of your mollycoddle steaia-heated apartment seem al most cheerless. Lack of cleanliness may be sug gested as an explanation of the prevalence of disease among the poor. In the case of typhoid fever and the other intestinal Infections (in which flies play such a promi r.ent role) filthinesa is undoubtedly an important factor. A household cr other place that harbors flies at eny time of year is certainly a f.lthy place, sod the intestinal dis eases are Tilth diseases if that title can be applied to any type of dis ease. Crowding, too confines living quarters, necessitating prolonged intimate contact berween the var ious occupants at all times, is the real cause of the undue frequency ot sickness among the poor. And co one in power, no one with any Influence, dares to raise a linger against the entrenched landlords who gleefully and Insolently gather the profits from all this. LOYE UNDER A.N UMBRELLA. By Genevieve Ulmar. "I won't take no for an answer," declared Neal Arnold, volubly. "What! My oldest friend not come to see where and how I live? You're booked for tea at our home, old fellow, and I'll calt for you at sir "You'll find mf a dull guest, Neal," insisted ( Bartley Deane. "You see, I'm not used to com pany." "Well, my sisters needn't scare ou. Marcia is quite an old maid; Nettie Just out of her teens. Why, you've degenerated into a regular celibate. At twenty-five shame! What's the trouble a heart ro mance?" "Ko, a distant warning, Neal. I've been attracted by two young ladies in my career. I came near falling into the trap until I dis covered one of them slapping the younger children and Insolent to her mother. The other made a boast how she'd make the money fly when she was Mrs. Deane. I never went back to either of them." "Well, you prim, sedate, old fashioned anchorite, come up to our house and see real home life and get some of the pessimistic wrinkles out of your mentality." Bartley Deane was 'in a measure old-fashiojied: good-looking, finely intelligent young man as he was. Life had not soured him, but after his experience with the two young ladies he had noted he had allowed a prejudice against the gentler sex to develop and grow. He received a welcome at Neal's house that warmed hl3 heart from the staTt. The mother was some thing of an invalid and it pleased Bartley to follow the movements of pretty, active Nettie Arnold as she cared for the two little chil dren and attended to the duties of the table. Neal had an unexpected business call from downtown and had to leave immediately after the meal. Then Nettie received a phone from a girl friend who lived half a mile away and was ill. She excused herself prettily, promising to be absent only a short time. "Why, it Is raining hard," abruptly observed Miss Marcia as she went to the window and glanc ed out. "That is the cause of Net tie's detention. She hurried away without gossamer or umbrella. I had planned to have her give us some music." "Why, I have an .umbrella," Eaid Bartley, "and if you think " "Would you be so kind?" asked Marclft. "You can take the gossa mer and I can give you the num ber of the Ellis home." Thus it was that Bartley Deane a little later was Joined by Nettie on the porch of the home of Net tie's friend and started out to face the driving storm. He thrilled at i the light touch of the pleasantly chatting maiden on his arm. The umbrella truly furnished a capa cious shelter, and a sense of cozi ness and unusual pleasure pervad ed Bartley. A violent gust ot wind had struck the umbrella and it was blown, not out, but shut. Some catch had slipped, enveloping both of them, bringing them envelop ing both of them, bringing them, close together in a momen tary mutual captivity. They could not move. Bartley felt the breath of his companion sweep his face. She was almost in his clasp. It was an ecstatic moment, he nev er forgot. He managed to right the umbrella. He incoherently spoke of tho strange mishap, but his compan ion laughed brightly. Her face w as (lushed and her eyes dancing, but he could not note that in the dark. "I I declare!" he stumbled, "I was positively stupid to turn the umbrella the wrong way," and the memory of close companionship with this model of girlish gracu and beauty would not depart. Nettie sang and played for him and Bartley left the Arnold homo .with a new ideal In his soul. When he got home he found a slip of hair ribbon caught in one of the ribs of the umbrella. He carefully placed it in his pockethook and was growing sentimental. He was in love. Bartley compre hended it more and more ,as the days passed by. His fluttering heart emphasized the conviction after each further call at the Ar nold home. And Nettie liked him. Her brother told him so and Bart ley bought a volume on "Decorum as an Art" and "Lovemaking as a Science." He renearsed a set speech he planned making when an auspicious moment arrived. His shy nature, however, impelled pro crastination. It was fate, coincidence perhaps, but two months later he and Nettie were at a picnic. Again he had his umbrella with him and again it rained. He held it over her as they stood in the partial shelter of a tree. He looked down into the sweet face so near to him. His pet speech came to his lips, but he could not utter it. "The night the umbrella came shut it was on account of that little catch shifting," and he placed a An ger upon the spot in question. "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Nettie In pretty confusion (Hip SUjU of imm Washington, Dec. 3. The casual ty list given out today by the war department has a total' of 1,627 names. (SECEI03 ONE.)
