TUM GEB EBAL ASSEMBLY* A healthy tone seems to pervade thc General Assembly this session. They vast to do right and are trying to pro? tect the people's interest. Oar repre? sentatives are thoroughly impressed 1 that oar people are taxed almost to death. They know that something is wrong somewhere, and they are infused with the spirit to set things to rights, and the economists, as they are con? temptuously called, are biasing the way for easier traveling for the people. That is all right. Taxes mast come down Bat the Legislature began at the wrong end the other day when it commenced to prune the judges salaries. The majority of oar judges earn every cent of their salaries, and, besides, to commence economy here is poor econ? omy, indeed, as the importance and dignity of the position demands the best legal talent the State can afford, and rt stands to reason that a man learned in the law cannot be had for a small salary. Bat the General Assem? bly ts on the right track, and ia this desire to reduce the taxes will be sus? tained by the people of this State. The Greenville News talks plainly and to the point when it said the other day that "everything is cheaper now than it was ten or twelve years ago ex? cept salaries and other government ex? penses. Thc taxes paid in this State to-day represent more bales of cotton than did the taxes of Radical times, waile the land on which the cotton is ramed will produce co more than it did thea, and most of the taxation is paid with cotton money ; they represent more pounds of wheat and seeks of flour than they did. The farmer's land will yield no more, bat a greater part is taken by the tax gatherer; his money j represents more cotton, provisions and 1 clothing than it did bat its power in dearing off tax bills is not increased." Every word of the above is trae, and it is the solemn duty of every maa ia tte House and Senate to work for eooo emy and let oar tax-hardened people hare a living chance io this life. AM IMPORTANT MATTER. Representative Walter Hazard, of Georgetown County, has paved the way for an honest vote k bis joint resolu? tion offered on last Saturday to amend the Constitutional provisions in relation to the qualification of electors. This educational provision requires that every male citizen "who shall be able to read the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State, in the English laagaage, ead to write his same legibly*' shall be entitled to vote. The reseiutfco lays the foundation for intelligent voting and places white and , black apee thc only fair and jost foot? ing in the exercise of sovereignty. An hosest expression of the people's will caa only be arrived at through in? telligent votes, and no vote b an honest vote unless it is aa intelligent one, and aa ed ?cation rd qualification is absolutely Piesau ry to insure the country'a peace and prosperity where ignorance pre? vails to say extent. The man, be be white or black, wbo cannot comply with the requirements of Mr. Hazard's resolution eaght to be regarded by his coan try as a dangerous voter, and therefore should not be allowed to jeop? ardise her trae interest by casting an ignorant vote. The eight-box law bas proved a biers- j lng to South Carolina, and has been in effect an educational qualification of electors. Bat what is pre-eminently j oat and proper at one period of time may not be so at another. This is a very grave and important question for ns to consider, sod evidently represen? tative Hazard realizes the situation as hts proposed amendment plaioly indi? cates. _ HE I>ID HIS DUTY Birmingham, Ala., is in a terrible State of excitement and the citizens of that city are almost rabid over the wholesale killing brought about by a nob gathered for the express purpose to force che jail and take out and hang one Hawley accused of the murder of his wife and children. This man as? serts most positively his innocence, bot tbe greater part of the citizens of Birm? ingham believed him guilty and at? tempted to lynch him the other night. Tbe mob were wild with rage and ex? citement and they made an attack upon tbe jail. The Sheriff with his armed men warned the mob that he wonld fire upon them if they attacked the jail. Some of the would-be lynchers opened fire and the Sheriff ordered his posse to fire upon them. Ten persons were killed and quite a number wounded. The excite m tat that followed was so great thal thc cry for the Sheriff's blood riocrld bc beard on every side. The Governor ot the State bad to send troops down to protect the Sheriff and the accused mao. Thc Sheriff did his duty bravely and promptly and deserves the commenda? tion of every law abiding citizen not only in Birmingham but in the United States. It was not for the Sheriff to consider whether Hawley was guilty or innocent. He was his pris? oner and ta jail. It was bis sworn duty and business to protect him, and let the jury of his country pass upot bis guilt or ionocenoe. We are satisfied that after the excite meat subsides the people of Binning* ham will see that they were wrong it crying for the blood of the Sheriff wh< ought to be held up as aa example tc all of the Sheriffs in America. POOR CHARLESTON. We are sorry for Charleston. A few politicians mn the machine all theil own way and the people of that citj have no more to do with the manage? ment of their political affairs than thc man in the moon. This, fact was forcibly illustrated on last Friday even? ing at the special meeting of the Char? leston County Democratic Convention called by the Executive Committee to consider the nuanimoos aotion of the committee in recommending that th? primary plan of nominating democratic candidates be substituted for the con? vention. The Charleston papers were fall ot the proceedings of the meeting, and there was not one single argument that would bold good against the proposed change, and yet there was no change. It stayed Convention. The politicians were on hand and said it must be Con? vention and Convention it is. Capt. F. W. Dawson worked hard for the primary plan, but all of his forcible arguments aod eloquence for the change were is vain with the politi? cians ; but he has won the unbounded admiration of the people of South Carolina by the stand be took in this matter. A SC?LLAW?G DEFINED. Now, what is a scallawag ? A seal la wag is an ex-Confederate soldier, who after the war in which be was physically crushed by force of arms, came home to crawl tod fawo before the dominant faction of his conquerors, recanting the principles which, residing in the soul of every native Southerner, are as im? mortal as the soul itself, of constitu? tional liberty and the supremacy of the white race.-Bessemer (Ala,') Journal. The origin of this expressive word is said to be as follows : Around Rich? mond, during the war, the drovers who supplied the army with beef were ac? customed to speak of scabby, mangy, diseased cattle is "scallawags," and the word fitted so well the type of per? son above described, th* it was adopt? ed by a unanimous vote. This result ?tay have been aided by th? lively ree? lections left in the minds of many a Confederate soldier of having such beef served oat to him as rations, along with the "salt horse** and other such tooth? some delicacies so familiar in camp. Senator Marion Moise is recognized as a conspicuous figure ia the State Sen? ate and his arguments on the various j questions before that body are always i lucid and logical. Representative Altamont Moses fought manly against the bill to reduce the judges* salaries and bis speech against the arguments of the eoono ? mists has been the theme of praise by many. The correspondent for the News and j Courier says Mr. Wilson, of Sumter, is [ working for re-apportionment, but that ' the bill is likely to go over as well as ! tts author. We will wager a bet that our representative will always be able to bold his own. Senator M. C. Butler was elected his own successor yesterday to the United States Senate by the General Assembly. He and Senator Hampton are likely to represent us in that august body until their death, as South Carolina never forgets her war heroes. On our first page will be fouod the report of the Committee of the Farmers* Association appointed to visit tho Mis? sissippi Agrien lt aral College. It isa plain statement, covering the points upon which reliable information is de? sired by our people at this time, and the high character of the gentlemen who composed the committee should satisfy all that their report is reliable. The New York llerald, of Monday, states that the cause which led to the j duel at Sand Bar Ferry the other day j between a gentleman from Lancaster j whose name cannot be ascertained and j Dr. Du lio, of Baltimore, was an insult I ing remark made by the latter about j Senator M C.Butler. The unknown j South Carolinian who was true-blue to j Senator Butler is thought to be badly j wounded. Dr. Duliu has been arrested > and is in jail in Augusta. (Prom our Regular Correspondent.) WASHINGTON LETTER. WASHIXOTO*. D. C., Dec. ?, 1888. 'Senator Blackburn, owiog to the ! wide advertisement of bis recent mis I understanding with Judge Bucker, has j been the center of attraction to the ! visitors io the Senate gallery this week, j He positively refuses to talk about the i matter, but his friends regard it as j ended-at least that is what they say. j Senator Harris, by a motion to lay ! the Senate tariff bill ou the table, j brought out the fact that tb? republi ; eau Senators will vote solidly in favor of that measure, notwithstanding the fact that several of them are known to be bitterly opposed to certain sections of the bill. Several explanations are given for this action by parties who profess to know. One is that Harrison j bas stated that he wants the bill pa*sed ?at this session, aud that those republi I cans that are opposed to it are afraid to vote against it, lest they thereby lose their share of patronage under the new ! administration ; another is, that they | ! know the bill will not pass the Hou?e ! aod only vote for it to keep np an ap? pearance of harmony tn the republican ranks until after Harrison is inaugura? ted, leaving the quarrel that is believed by many people to be ioevitablo over the tariff, until the next session, when ! they will control both House and j Senate. i The President's message was an able statement of the position of the detr eratic party on the tariff and other mi ters of importance ; the ideas express therein could not have been improve Statements like the following from tl message are ponderous with statesma like wisdom : 'He mocks the peor, who proposes that the Government sb; protect the rich, and that they io ta will care for the laboring poor. Ai intermediary between the people ai their government, or the least deleg tioo of tba care and protection ti Government owes to the humblest cit zen in the land, makes the boast of fr institutions a glittering delusion, ai the pretended boon of American citize ship a shameless imposition.' * * 'Extravagant appropriations of publ money with all their demoralizing co: sequences should not be tolerate either as a means of relieving the tre sury of its present surplus, or i furnishing pretext for resisting a prop? reduction in tariff rates.' * * * 'It cannot be denied that the seifu and private interests which are i persistently heard when efforts are mac to deal in a just and comprehens? manner with our tariff laws, are relate to if they are not largely responsib for, the sentiment largely prevailio among the people, that the genon Government is the fountain of iudivic ual and private aid ; that it may t expected to relieve with paternal cai the distress of citizens and commun ties, and that from the fullness of ii Treasury it should upon the slight] possible pretext of promoting the genen good, apply public funds to the benet of localities and individuals. Nor ca it be denied that there is a growin assumption that as against the Govern ment and in favor of private claims an interests, the usual rules and limitation of business principles and just dealing should be waived. These ideas hav been unhappily muoh encouraged b legislative acquiescence. Relief froi COD trac ts made with the Government i too easily accorded in favor of the citi zen; the failure to support claim against the Government by proof i often supplied by no better considerado than the wealth of the Government an the poverty of the claimant ; gratnitie in the form of pensions are grantee upon DO other real ground than th needy condition of the applicant, or fo reasons less valid ; and large sums ar expended for public buildings and othe improvements upon representation scarcely claimed to be related to publi needs and necessities.' The House yesterday by unanimou consent took up the direct tax bill which caused the long deadlock las spring. It is expected that it will bi passed, but hopes are expressed by it opponents that Mr. Cleveland will vet< it. Mr. Harrison's backbone ie likely t< suffer a severe strain between now ant the fourth of March. The repa bli caa leaders here have determined npoi having an extra session of the Fifty first Congress called to meet late ii March or early in April. There is no the slightest necessity of au extra scs? sion ; the republicans acknowledge that their only object in having it callee is to gain the six Senators and as man) Repr?sentatives as South Dakota. Montana and Washington, when admit ted as states, shall be entitled to, Thej have decided thai owing to their ver) narrow margin in both Houses, this action is necessary in order to enable the new states to organize and send their Senators and Representatives in time for the beginning of the regular December session. It remains for Mr. Harrison to decide if he will allow his party leaders to compel him to call a needless session for the sake of a few more votes. Death of Col. H. B Bridgers. Special Dispatch to Charle$ton World. 

COLUMBIA, Dec 10.- Col. R. R. Bridgers, president of the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, and one of the most prominent and well known railroad men in the Southern States, died in this city this evening at 6 o'clock. He was addressing tbe Senate railroad committee on the bills to extend the time of the Wilmington, Columbia and Augusta Railroad to construct a drawbridge ever the Wateree river, when he was suddenly overcome by a rush of blood to- bis bead. He staggered, and was caught and placed on a sofa. He asked for his nephew, Capt. J. T. Barron, to speak to the committee for him in behalf of the road. Not reviving, be was placed in a covered wagon and carried to Captain Barron's residence on Plain street, where a physician was called in, but to no avail, as be died after lingering' in a semi unconscious condition until 7 30. Colonel Bridgers was in perfect health apparently wheo be went to the com? mittee meeting, and his sudden taking off was a great shock to his relatives and friends in this city. He was 72 years old, and had been for many years identified with the railroad interests of this state, as well as of the entire South. He was one of the chief magnates of the Atlantic Coast Line, and always enjoyed the reputation of being a generous and liberal capitalist. A special train was made up at mid? night, and the remains were conveyed to bis home in Wilmington. A num? ber of his friends will meet the body at Florence, and accompany it on the rest of the journey. -- ?HH^a^ 'M' Letter from Qui Vive.
