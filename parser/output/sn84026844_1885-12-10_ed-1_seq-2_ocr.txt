The Pie?idoi<t on tne TarilT. mi ? ? i.u- v.oc.n v?rv nnxirma to AUU CUUUtl/ kuu *u.u know what position the President would take on the taritf; whether he would surrender to the majority element of his party and the Mugwumps, or whether he would restsuro American industry by planting himself unujuivocally on its side. The President takes his stand on the wrong eidt?on the tarifT plank of the Democratic platform, on the side of the "revenue reformers." ' The fact," says the President, "that ' our revenues are in excess of the actual I needs cf an economical administration of the government, justifies a reduction in J the amount extracted from the people for its support." This, in face of the further facts that gross receipts are fast diminishing? nearly $Vi>,COO;000 less in 1885 than in lfe'84, and fstimated at about $8 000,0001 less in the fiscal year 188Gthunin 1885; that | the fast falling annual surplus will, according to the cflicial ef-tiinatcs, give way to a deficiency of $24,500,000 in the next fiscal year; and that the country demandsi and tho President recoinuieuda the build-1 ing of a navy. But the country is more interested to know (1) which or Hie revenues inerremdent is desirous of reducing, and (2) alocg which line he proposes to strike. He. is good enough to make his idea reasonably clear. (1)"The piopcsiticn with which we have to deal iB the reduction of the reve-i uuo received by t ho Government and in-1 directly paid by the people from customs dities." (2) "I think tho reduction should be made in the ravenuo derived from a tax1 upon the imported necessaries of life." I It is evident that the President has imbibed the free trade tincture. He regards the tariir aa a tar neceajarily piid by tho consumer. Within a year cut nails have I sold at forty cents a keg above the duty on | them; there are noue imported?is this tariff a tax on the consumer? But it is | not necetsary at this time' to pursue this branch of tho subjtri?prices of manufactured products to day aa compared with prices of like commodities under a tarill'l t )T revenue only make their own argu-1 ment. If the President has investigated the subject he is aware that reduced tariff ratea are not an abeolute remedy for ex-1 ceesive diatoms revenue; that, iu fact, their first effect may easily be 10 sweu me receipts from this source, and this would continue until the purchasing power of tho peoplo had been seriously impaired by the injury of their industries and consequent loss of employment. That, on the other hand, customs revenues may be diininifched by increasing the duties to a prohibitory point, iB an obviouB proposition, and sucli diminution, if skillfully brought about, would leave intact the industrial energies of the country. If Congress were to follow tho President's advice, so confidently given, and make the reduction of revenue on the "imported necesiaries of life," Congress would be doing what England very ardently hopes we may do. From what nny be considered the necessaries of life we collected last year 70 percent of the whole customs revenue. These articles embrace sugar and molasses, wool, cotton, iron and steel, silk, flax, hemp jute, chemicals, dyes, drugs, hides and skins and their several manufactures. If we invite larger importations of these commodities we displace to that extent Amoricni labor. Follow out the President's) thought, and Congress will also lay its hands on salt, coal and lumber, in which West Virginia among other States is interested. There is no guaranteo that rednced duties, or no duties, on "the necessaries of life" would greatly lower prices to consumers. Tho abolition of the coffee duty is a case in point. But it may be granted that the effect would be as tho President anticipates?to "lessen the cost of living to every . family in' tho land." What would be the net gain if by that very reduction of price the power to purchase wero soriously impaired or destroyed? If wool is to be grown and manufactured elsewhere, if iron is to be mined and turned into useful forms in other countries, K is of little moment to the wool grower, the operative in tho woolen mill, the coal and iron miner, tho man heretofore employed in making iron or steel?it is of little moment to him that he has as a compensation a wool hat or a jack-knife at a reduced price. Plentifulness of employment at fair wages is what a country needs; without this more cheapness of commodities will till no stomachs and cover no backs. A _i.<vAnnnav for a uvtnl hftfc hv ft ill It U Tt IIU bnu J.?; <v. .. n?? ~J ? dAy'a labor ia not likely to envy the men who can buy a better hat lor ten centa but lacks the ten centa. Employment ia tho very first of tho neceaaariea of life. A protective tariff ia on the aide of employment. 1 * New Publications.

She "shoots folly as it flies" and forces those who accompany her to enjoy the target practice. In her new book, "Sweet Cicely," in which she does up Joaiah Allen aa a politician, ahe embraces i an opportunity for some of her moat effec- ' tive work. The book ia filled with "harm* j less merriment," and for the blues, or aa a diet for thin people to got fat on, "Sweet 1 Cicely" may be recommended with great confidence.

The Newt editorially says: "President Cleveland's message seems to place him in true succession to the greater men who have occupied the Presidential chair, rather than to the late Democratic line. It is conceived in a most just and friendly spirit towards all foreign Powers and contains no word to tickle the ears of American Jingos. The meesage expresses a sentiment of international good-will. It is equally wise and prudent on all domestic topics." The Foil says: "Some of tho old world statesmen might ponder with benefit over Mr ('luv/.lun/i'u ri'diinna t/Hinhinv th? Nicarauguan treaty." The Standard nays: ''The message is temperate and dignified. The message contrasts very favorably with some of the wild dispatches of Mr. frelisghaysen and Mr. Blaine. Mr. Cleveland's policy on the whole id worthy of adoption." The Times questions whether the President's ineesuge will occupy bo large a space in the thoughts of the world as the death of Mr. Vanderbilt. It says: "Thousands will speculate to-day upon the results of Mr. Vanderbilt'a death with an eagemees which events of large place in history fail to excite. The President's message reflects in traaquil and unexciting paragraphs the happy detachment of cointernational iealouites which it is the peculiar good lortuue of America to enjoy."

The Massillon accommodation on the Cloveland, Lorain A Wheeling, due at Bridgeport Tuesday at 10:15 a m , was derailed at Wheeling Valley, about five muen out, ana ma not get m uu z v. m. The cause of the accident was the breaking of an axle on engine No. 10, which was drawing the train. No aerioua injury was done the trainmen or passengers, although the entire affair was pretty well shaken up and narrowly escaped rolling into Wheeling creek. At 10 o'clock Tuesday morning a twoyear-old daughter of Charles Johnson fell into a lira crate near by. Her clothing took tire, and thero being no one in the room to extinguish the flames, the child's face was horribly burned. Her recovery is doubtful. Airs.
