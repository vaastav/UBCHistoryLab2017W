SHOPPING TtftfS'-'Wm CHRISTMAS! I ENDORSES THE ASHURST BILL The Central Labor Council, after hearing arguments for and against tho proposed bill for opening tho Klamath Indian reservation, unani mously decided to ondorso tho Ash urst bill, at its meeting last night. Tho council was impressed by the rrgument of Edward D. Ashurst, sponsor for the bill, that it would turn ovor tribal proporty only to those Indians competent to manage tholr own affairs; that others un able to properly care for tholr prop erty will bo looked after by tho gov . ment. Fred A. Baker spoke against the bill. He said that posterity would feel tho pernicious effects of this" legislation it the bill goes through In its rosent form. Ho calico, atten tion to tho evil that would follow tho deforestation of tho watorshed should the big timber corporations gain control of the Indians' land and leg it without regard to the prin ciples of good forestry. Mr. Ashurst opened the debate for tho bill, and Mr. Baker his argument against it, after which Mr. Ashurst (gain took the floor in rebuttal. Mr. Ashurst laid stress on tho effect that the local labor 'council's action would have on futuro action by state and national laior bodies, wtoo would bo guided largely by the ac tion, ho believed, of the labor clos est to the scene of controversy. After hearing the arguments, the room was cleared of all but union cclegatoU and tho council in exe cutive session, endorsed the bill. REAPER CALLS NEW YORK, Dec. 2. Honry Clay Frick, steel magnate, died at his homo hero today from the re sults of an attack of ptomalno pois oning which ho suffered about a month ago. The career of Henry Clay Frick has formed one of the most fascinat ing chapters In tho romance of in dustry in tho United States. At ton, a boy on a farm in a family of only ordinary means, ho was, at sixty, a man of so many millions that his fortune, liko those of Carnegie and Rockefeller, was largely a matter of guess-worki oven to himself. It has been said ho was worth moro than $100,000,000, perhaps as much as $20000,000. Mr. Frick built up tho greatest coko business in tho world, and ac quired such vast intorests in steal that ho was also ono of tho principal magnets in that industry, and in rounding out his caroed he became known as ono of tho world's greatest collectors of master paintings. He wns born Decombor 19, 1849, nt West Overton, Pa. Early in life be entered tho coko trade, then in its infancy, and on its dovolopmont founded his fortune. Through the coko business ho be- STEEL MAGNATE x aSSSkf 3&(:&&7 TRAIN BANDIT ESCAPES POSSE CASPER, Wyo.( Dec. 2.

Carlisle's cap ture Is expected hourly. He 1a suf fering from a wound in the hand and tho temperature is ton degrees below zero. STAFF OF LIFE E After hesitating for weeks in the hope that the cost of production would take a drop, J. Hlrvl, of the Hirvl Baking company made the an nouncement this week of an increase- in tho wholesale price of bread to fifteen cents a loaf. This has necessitated an advance In the retail price to seventeen cents at least that Is the price he is asking tbe grocers to sell the bread for. This increase in tho wholesale and retail prices is the same as was made some weeks ago in San Fran Cisco and Portland, where the costs are lower than here and where, af tor a thorough Investigation, the au thorlties admitted the new price was Justified. Speaking of the change, Mr. Hirvi said: "I havo been losing money for months and the time has como when I can see no other'course to follow. I am sorry that it has to bo done, and the only thing I ask for is the co-operation of the grocers and the fair consideration of the public. Just as soon as I can lower the price I will do It." The prospects of lower prices are not very bright and Mr. Hirvi need not anticipate any such a much-to- be-desired reduction, for the reason that there is a great scarcity of bak er's flour and reports from Port land are to the effect that by spring the price of bread will be twenty cents a loaf, or higher. OWEILL-BAKER DEBATE OPERA HOUSE TOJflGHT. C. M. O'Neill and Fred A. Baker will debate the Ashurst bill for the opening of the 4 Klamath Indian Reservation to- 4 night at the Houston Opera House.

He was also a power in the Baltimore & Ohio, Norfolk & Western and other roads. On December 15, 1881, Mr. Frick was married to Miss Ada Howard Childes of Pittsburg. Four children were born to them; two boys and two girls. Mrs. Frick, ono son and one daughter survive. KT mm Ago. '.Krw?aBBf " J 1 E IS COVERED BY THE PRESIDENT McftHngo to Sixty-sixth Oongrosa Rec ommends Great Variety of Ad vanced Legislation Radicalism la Attacked Tariff Changes Urged WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Genoral recommendations on legislation to combat tbo high cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and' measures tending to a readjustment of the na tion to a peace time basis were fea tures of President Wilson's annual message to the sixty-sixth Congress,, delivered today. The peace treaty, the President told Congress, will be discussed, in. a separate message later, as will tbe railroad question. For the second time only since the President estab lished the practice of addressing' Congress in person, the message to day was read by clerks. The President's principal recom mendations Included: establish ment of the budget system for na tional finan'ces, re-organization of the taxation system, with simplifi cation of income and increased prof its taxea and a readjustment of the tarriff system, if necessary, to meet changed industrial conditions. Recognition of the services of the veteran soldiers of the world war. and relief for thera, particularly la theway of government farms as pro posed by Secretary Lane of the De partment of the Interior, was among the measures suggested. An enlarged program for rural development measures which will remove causes for restlessness in the body politic was touched on and. )h President strongly renewed hi3 re commendations for legislation to deal with "those persons who, by violent methods would abrogate our time tested institutions." Apparently having in mind' the coal strike injunction order the President in the message asserted that, while tho right to strike is In violate and should not be interfered with by any government process, there is a predominant right and that is the right of tbe government to protect all its people and to as sert Its power and majesty against any class. The government, he said, when it asserts that right, seeks not to an tagonize a class, but simply 'to de fend the rights of the whole people against irreparable injury.
