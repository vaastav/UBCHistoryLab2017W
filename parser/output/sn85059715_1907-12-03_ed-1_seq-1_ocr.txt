DECIDEDLY ROOSEVELTIAN. Bold and Aggressive Stand is Taken for Many Big Gov ernmental Reforms. ?Bjr Associated Pr?s?.l. WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. The joint committee of the Senate and House or Representatives ap ' pointed yesterday to notify President Roosevelt that Congress was regular* ly in session and prepared rn l>cgin business, reached the White House to perform that duty shortly after 10 o'clock this morning. The Presi dent told the committee he would communicate in writing to the Con . gress. The annual message of the Presi dent was received by the Senate at 12: IS and within a minute Secre tary Bennett began reading it un , der direction from the Vice Presi dent. The secretary was followed ?closely by many senators who had printed copies of the message. The -4 tallery was crowded with visiters ^??ho gave^close attention In the reading. The reading of the President - message in the House wxis followed with close attention by members and the public In the galleries. The message in full is as follow.-.: To the Senate and House of Repre senatives: No nation fcas greater resources than ours, and 1 think it can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energy and industrial abilir in n-o iriiion a-* the fundamental 1' "-Ine^. >>ndl tlims sounder than In ours at tills very moment, and Is foolish, when such Is the case, for " -ople to hoard money instead of keeping it in sound hanks; for it Is such hoarding that 1s the immediate occasion i money stringency. Moreover, as rule, the business of our people Is conducted with honesty and probi!* and this applies alike to farms an ! factories, to railro:nls and l>a : ? all our legitimnt ? commercial < ?' - prises. In any large body of men. liow pypi*, * iter** are certain to be some wl\o ;ire dishonest, and if the condi tions are such that these men pros 'per or commit their misdeeds with impunity., their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business men ) of great sagacity and of tempera ment l>oth unscrupulous and wreck less. and where the conditions are such that they act without supervis ion or control and at first without ef fective check from public opinion they delude many .innocent people into making investements or into embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the mis deeds of these successfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them.- but upon the innoncent men whom they have mis led. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs, and naturally, when it does oocur those who suf fer are apt to forget that the longer it wits deferred the more painful It would b?. in the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is possible to refrain because of such distress from strlvi <? >mi aa end to the misdeed; 'e the ultimate causes of tlie !.ti'"rlng anS as means to this end, - Iblo to punish those r ' >.o f?r them. There may b<- lonest differ ences of opinion as t i many govern mental poUcies: bet rely there c?" be no euch dlfferea.- as to th.0 need of unflinching pe ranee In the war against succc i'al dishonesty.

A panic brought on by .the specula tive folly of part of the business community would 'hurt the w.hole business community: but such step page of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting.
