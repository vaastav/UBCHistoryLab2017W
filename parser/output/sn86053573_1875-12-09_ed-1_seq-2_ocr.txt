"I mean specie resumption." President Grant's Message. "Tun education of the masses becomes " the first necessity for the preservation of " our institutions." V. S. Grant. "Establish and forever maintain free " public schools adequate to the education " of all the children." President Grant's Message. Trinity cmracn, in Hew York city, with its millions of real estate, some of which is rented to liquor dealers, has not been heard from yet regarding President Grant's proposition to tax church property. No doubt, in time, we shall learn that this ofishoot of the Church of England is of the opinion that he is a candidate for rcnomi nation. ;Pi:obai!LY the best commendation that President Grant could require of the equity of the allusions in his Message to the Cuban question is to be found in the fact that 'while the people of Madrid be came excited over the assumption that he was decidedly in sympathy with the Patriots, fe&ch an inimical American jour nal as the New York Sun charges that " this portion of the Message (Cuban "affairs) will please the Spanish Dons " both in this country and in Europe." Two hundred Methodist clergymen in attendance upon the meeting of the Metho dist Episcopal Sabbath-school Union and Tract Society at Boston, last Monday, joined with Bishop Haven in renominating President Grant. Thereupon it is charged that he is the Methodist candidate for a Third Term. Before this thine goes any further it may be well to reflect that the President himself may have something to say on the subject not to say anything about the people generally. The new Postmaster of the House is a mac of many trials and sore tribulations. He has received such kindly consideration at the hands of Capt Sherwood, his prede cessor, that he is loth to part company with him. Five hundred applicants to be ap pointed to subordinate positions under him have been disappointed, mainly because they had not served in the Confederate army. The few who have succeeded in getting appointments took the qualified oath of ofiice, and are correspondingly happy. la un news fOLrwxs we print with unusual pleasure a letter to the National Uiutblican from Col John W. Forney, the distinguished American representative of the interests of our Centennial Exposi tion in Europe. The letter will engage the serious attention of Congress upon an important matter, and will convey to our readers much desirable information, and we ore mistaken if it docs not greatly stimulate patriotic endeavor throughout the country to make our Centennial Cele bration the crowning glory of the first hundred years of our national annals. A&wErBEDicTED.thcIndependentPrcss, so called, with the New York Tribune at its heed, insists that President Grant is a candidate for re election because be did not declare to the contrary in his Message. It makes but little difference, however, what they insist The inference is about as fair as the Tribune's charge that the school question, "rigidly defined, is an anti Catholic issue." The intelligent Catholics of the country will resent this insinuation as demagogical, as the people generally will repudiate the far-fetched inference re garding the Third Term. A 

8INCEIIE nEGUET is expressed by the "old" members of the House of both par tics that the former clerks and employees of that body are to be displaced. This is particularly true of ex-Clerk McPherson's able corps of assistants, as well as of sev eral of the clerks of leading committees. This feeling is very natural, and results from the warm friendships engendered by long personal association. It is unfortunate, in many regards, that any changes of the kind alluded to should be made at all, be cause the clerical labor of the House will .necessarily be transferred to unfamiliar hands, and the interests of the people not to say anything of the valiant and patriotic Democracy will suffer accordingly. "Sexatok" McMillan prints an open letter to "Gov." JIcEncry, of Louisiana, in another column of this issue, in which he withdraws his credentials and resigns his office. This act will not complicate the Louisiana muddle, but on the contrary will simplify it nnless some one else should happen to be "elected" to be his successor. II must be admitted, however, that Mr. McMillan has pursued a very proper course. Recognizing in the recent action of the House an additional ratification of the Louisiana Adjustment, he steps forward to add the force of his character to the main tenance of the Opposition pledges to sus tain that agreement. The letter is calm and dignified, and shows that he abandons his contest, not without reluctance, but in accordance with his ideas of political duty. The New York Tribune seems to think that President Grant "wentoutof his way" to recommend the free-school amendment to the Constitution, and that because his is an " outgoing Administration " the propositions accompanying the amend ment are simply a "bid for votes." There is no doubt about this latter deduction, al though any respectable authority would characterize it as a declaration of progres sive and aggressive principle in behalf of the Republican party. The phrase "bid for votes" is worthy of a demagogue only, and of one who sees in the promulgation of statesmanlike truths or rules for public guidance the mere trick of a politician. The fact, however, that the Tribune and other Opposition agents show so much feeling regarding this matter proves most conclusively that the President has struck a popular chord, and they arc simply en deavoring to weaken bis influence with the people. They will find it to be up-hill work. Among the apparent necessities of the political situation is the preservation of son-sectionalism. This can only be ac complished by.giving to the Republicans of the Southern States the balance of power i. e., preserving for the blacks" and their political friends lie privilege of voting In. accordance with their natural promptings. If this is not done the lemocrats, who are sectionalism without disguise, will obtain control of thos? State?, and tho ante be liim condit'oa or affairs will be restored. It is for this restoration that the Confederate majority ot tho House of Representatives will "labor without re mission. They may claim, as Mr. Lamir does, that they are' on o and all as loyal and more truly con-sectional than the most extreme Northern "Radical." Amoment's reflection, however, will serve to convince any reasonable man thaftbo final result ot the policy of negro disfranchisement, which they advocate, will be to Southernize the South, so to speak, and destroy all possi bility of final reconstruction on the broad basis of common citizenship. 

BADE OF A DISAPPOINTED PEOPHET. The New York Herald has found a new sensation. And, wonder of wonders, it has discovered it in the President's Mes sage. It is within the recollection of most of the readers of that luminous and highly consistent sheet that it has, of late, been much devoted to warning the public that the President was preparing a foreign war with Spam or with Mexico as a basis for a "Third Term." Since its invention and publication of the Caaar articles, and the theory involved in them, tho Herald has suffered amazingly from this Third Term night-mare of its own raising. It has killed it off several times, or rather it has held several coroner's inquests over it, and upon each of these several occasions pronounced the pretended issue dead dead beyond resurrection. The declaration of Gen. Dix killed it; the elections of 1674 killed it; the declarations against it of Republican Stato conventions in 1873 killed it; Grant's letter killed it, (although the Herald, we believe, then intimated a feline specimen hidden in that heap of Indian meal;) the results of the elections of 1875, taken in connection with the anti Third Term resolutions of the Republican conventions, killed it, and, in short. f(jr a thing which never had even the shadow of an existence anywhere else i1 than in the befogged vision and bedizened brain of the intellectual department of the sensational New York press, it has en joyed a most remarkable number of deaths and resurrections. But the most remarka ble feature of these demises and reappear ances Is the fact that they, all of them, oc cur at the bidding of the chief necromancer of the New York Herald. As a theoretical magician and a resurrectionist he has no equal in this or any other country. As a consistent truth-teller and safe political adviser, who is distinguished by fidelity to principle, he is a lamentable failure. Since I the days of John Tyler s administration there has been no President that the Herald has not flattered, patronized and abused by turns without any very remarkable suc cess. It has volunteered advice to them all upon almost every conceivable subject and policy of a character that no statesman or patriot could reasonably be expected to accept, coupled generally with promises of its powerful support in the event of accept ance, and its .advice has almost as invaria bly been rejected. The President's Message, which was read in both Houses of Congress on Tues day, has evidently both surprised and dis appointed the Herald. Upon all those subjects that the Herald had predicted that it would "put its foot in it," to use a homely slang phrase, it seems to meet the approbation of that journal. In this mat ter the Herald is greatly disappointed, and on this account it is unable to conceal its chagrin. But as it is rarely at a loss, in common with all chronic grumblers, for something with which to find fault, so now it discovers a new cause for sensation in the recommendations of the President for amendments of the Constitution concerning the public schools and taxation of church property. Itsays. "HcissoundontheCuban " question; sound in the main on the most " important of the financial questions; sound " and admirable on the question of cable " monopolies; discreet and even wise on " the Mexican question; plausible at least, if " not right, on the naturalization question." The President should be, and no doubt is, thankful for this liberal indorsement from such a fountain of wisdom and oracle of profound statesmanship upon five points of his Message, and these the very points upon which this great political seer had predicted that his political ambition would lead him astray. And yet this most wonderfully sagacious prophet, with the full light of the Des Moines speech df the President before him, is angry nitli himself because he failed to predict that the President would recom mend in his Annual Message that the doc trines announced in that speech should be en crafted upon the Constitution of the United States in a legal and constitutional manner. This, it must be admitted, is most unfortunate for the character of the Herald as chief political prophet of the country, but it is difficult to see how the President can be blamed for the short-comings of that journal's prediction editor. And it is still more difficult to reconcile those short comings of its intellectual and imaginative departments with the torrent of abuse and misrepresentation with which the Presi dent is visited on account of them in the following tirade: "But on the combined " religious and school question, upon which " he lays his chief stress and emphasis, he " is wild, Quixotic and utterly. absurd. " This attempt to introduce religion as a " controlling clement in our national poli " tics, the zeal with which he flings this " firebrand and tries to kindle theological " animosities for party effect, is the most " mischievous and monstrous violation of " fitness and propriety ever perpetrated by " a President of the United States." Passing by as unworthy any journal pre tending to dignity and respectability, the assertion that "he is wild, Quixotic and utterly absurd" in these recommendations, it may not be amiss to call attention to the willful misrepresentation contained in the sentence immediately following it. All classes of readers, of all sects and denomi nations of religion, unite in ascribing per fect fairness and the most liberal tolerance to all religious opinions as the bails of the President's proposition. Carried out to its logical results it will secure forever in this country entire immunity from religious id terference with the politics of the nation. The people, as well as the President, foresee the necessity of settling this ques tion now beyond all perad venture. If it is deferred until a later period, when any one denomination or sect may obtain prepon derance in our population, we may be vis ited with those religious difficulties which the Herald affects to be so anxious to avoid, but which are in no way raised by this proposition, because it is equally just to all and leaves all sects to stand or fall entirely upon their respective merits. The Herald, most unjustly and with un blushing effrontery, proffers this degrading insult to the intelligence of its readers in the same issue which contains the text of the Message, including the proposition of the President which exposes the falsity and mischievous malignity of the assertion: "He hopes to array the Protestant prej a " dice and Protestant bigotry in a political " crusade against the Catholic Church, and " thereby carry tho Presidential election." No one but the Herald can perceive the slightest advantage or Injury to either Pro testant or Catholic that could possibly re sult from tho proposed Constitutional amendment On the other hand, the propo sition should receive the unanimous support of all political parties and sects of religion as certain to remove.forever the possibility of religious questions entering our political arena, with their prejudices ind animosities. 

HIHOB TOPICS. 8p "How did you like the Message t" said a citizen yesterday to a Bourbon member of Congress. In reply theCongressman remarked that "should the President have occasion to send tiro or three more such excellent docu ments to tho House 'I would come out for a third term and stick to It." The rumor that Member Walker, of Vir ginia, is the handsomest man in the Honse was conflrmed yesterday. The sweetheart of a Northern member, who was in the gallery, became so charmed with Walker that' her lover could sot catch her eye for a whole half hour, and finally was compelled to .blow his nose; In order to attract her attention. She recognized the sound and dropped her eyes upon bun for a moment, but they soon .wand ered back to Walker under tho magic In fluence of his handsome "phiz." Tou could hare f towed a wholo library away In the cor rugations of the Northern member'a brow. The terrible disaster which has just over taken the fine steamer Deutschland in the North Sea helps to swell the list of ocean hor rors, whoso catalogue already is of apalllng length. The greater becomes our navigation facilities the more numerous become tbc acci dents at sea, and at present rates, the close of the nineteenth century will find us in the midst of daily ocean disasters, in comparison to which the ones of the present are bat feeble pigmies. By that time, however, the people will bave become so accustomed to tbe unfor tunate scenes as to take them readily as a matter of course. " I have been disappointed ; in fact, sir, I have been fooled out of a position. My Con gressman has softened on another man. My money is gone ; my patience is wearied, and I must fly to the bosom of my family for relief. But believe me, kind sir, I never fall to settle my board bills under any circumstances, and my trunk is at your disposal. Its contents are worth more than five times the bill. Take it, sir, and keep it until you hear from me." The trunk was retained by the landlord, and after the man had fled to the bosom of bis family it was opened and found to be neatly packed with old Nicholson paving-blocks. "I aint up here for a position," said a Confederate soldier yesterday as he stood on the curbing near Wfllard's with one hand in his pocket and the other buried in tho soil at Gettysburg, "but I came up to watch that little pension business." He was an agreeable looking fellow, and he had all the appearance of a man who really needed a pension. And why should he not have one? As he stood there, an old Union veteran came stumping along on one leg and a crutch, and it suggested the thought, "Why should he not have one!" Ho is a voter; has a representative In Congress: proposes to visit the Centennial and clasp hands across the bloody chasm, and why should he be deprived of that which this other soldier has? That he needs it just as much is plainly evident. His family is large, and be is unable to do manual labor. Thousands of Northern men who fonght no more gallantly than he are sustained and comforted by their pensions. His State is back in the Union, and he a citizen, exercising the full rights and privileges of an unfettered citizenship. Why should he be left out in th a cold? "I know," said he, "that I fonght for secession, bnt that is a lost cause; the Govern ment has accorded general amnesty to us all, and now It most care for those of us who were disabled in the strife. It is no more than rea sonable that we should be pensioned if we have to pay the taxes which meet the expense of it." He talked mildly, but there was a tone to his words which bespoke an unfaltering confidence in thoc who now have the control of this matter in their own hands. Will they disap point these men who need that for which they ask more than the average mendicant needs the crust thrust to him from the table of the rich? Bandall'i Weaknm. lC. (i. Bailor, la the N. O. Bepublican. J WASiHSCTOJf, D. C, November 30, 1S73, Tbc animus of the Confederate party in Congress is shown by its present disposition to turn with ferocity upon Mr. Randall, the lead ing candidate for Speaker of the House. It appears that Mr. Randall is not "sound" on the negro question. Here wo have the old cry again. For thirty years before the war'the question which decided the political destiny of "man and boy" in Washington, from President to page, was, "Is he sound on the negro?" And, Io! it Is the first question which the ex cited Confederate asks on finding himself once more in power at tbe National Capital. If this is to be the all-and-all of political discipline and official qualification under a Confederate Democratic coalition, will the leaders of that coalition be kind enough to remove the quids of tobacco from their mouths,wash their hands, clean their nailtjComb and brush thelrhalr, put on clean shirts, and, having taken a glass of cooling soda water, stand up like decent men and inform us how we are to get rid of this negro question? If the leaders of the Confederate-Democratic coalition will Insist upon Southern sec tionalism as the foundation rock of its organi zation, what right have tbsr to complain if the North also "combines" for self-protection? If hate of the negro is thus to be the perpetual animating life principle in the political exist ence of the Confederate-Democracy, what is the North to do bnt to meet this hate with a courageous purpose and crush it out of exist ence! (unless indeed this Confederate Demo cratic coalition is permitted io crush the life out of tho Union.) The continuation of tbe negro question as the one all-absorbing Issue in American politics to-day as it was five years ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago, is therefore due chiefly, if not solely, to the pro slavery party of the United States. The pro-slavery party is practically alive to-day, and never during my long experience of political affairs at the National Capital have I known It more rancorous, vindictive, illiberal and uncompromising than it Is now. It is con sequently Eheer effrontery for the so called "Conservatives" of the South, and their so called "Democratic" allies of the North to prate about the Republicans keeping the negro question alive for partisan purposes. But it Is useless to watte words with those who must either rule or fce ruled. The duty of Repub licans is plain in so far as they can exert any influence over tbe organization of the Confederate-Democratic House of the American Congress. It is to let these conspirators against the cause of humanity go their way while we go ours. Mr. Randall as the representative of the "liberal" Democratic sentiment of the North finds himself unexpectedly confronted by the "fierce" element of his own party. His ser vice to his party in aiding to defeat Republi can legislation last winter, as involved in the bill for the protection of elections, has se cured him a certain amount of following at the South, and which should give him the united Confederate support of Mississippi. But he now learns that notwithstanding that following, and notwithstanding the rich har vest it has produced in MlssltjippI, and not withstanding his services to the Confederate Democracy, he Is distrusted by those whom he has so effectively served. The real leaders of the party bave no idea of advancing any man so strong i a Is Mr. Randall. The result of the contest far the Speaker ship shows the correctness of the above views, which were written under date of December 1, from this city, Ed Jf at. Rep.
