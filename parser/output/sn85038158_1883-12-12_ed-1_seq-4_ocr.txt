The readers of the News will doubt be gratified to learn that we have sold a half interest in the office to Col. Geo. W. Barrere and his son Bebee, who will be associated in the management of the paper from and after January ist, 1884. The particulars of the new arrangement are more fully given in the supple ment accompanying this week's News. Col. Geo. W. Barrere is well known to ail our citizens as a correct and reliable business man, and there is good reason to believe that his connection with the paper will be advantageous to its interests in every respect. His son, Mr. Bebee Bar rere, who will have entire charge of the mechanical department, is an ex cellent job printer and a young of sterling integrity and industrious habits, who will spare 110 efforts to give satisfaction to our patrons in the department under his charge. The office will be removed about the first of January to the Iloggard building, a few doors west of our present location, where we shall be happy to see our old friends and the public generally. Bro. Frazer of the New Richmond (O) Independent, has purchased an interest in the Daily State Journal at Jefferson City, Mo., and offers the Independent for sale on very fa vorable terras. Bro. Frazer is a good editor and a genial gentleman, and will be missed by the editorial brotherhood of Ohio. lie has our best wishes for his success in his new location. We have received from Mr. W. R. Lazenby, Director of The Agricul tural Experiment Station at the Ohio State University, copies of printed circulars which he is sending to farmers throughout the State. Cir cular No. 1 relates to injurious in sects affecting the crops, and circular No. 2 relates to troublesome weeds. Farmers desiring to answer these circulars can obtain copies by ad dressing Mr. W. R. Lazenby at Co lumbus. The answers when received I will be carefully compared and classified, and the results published by the Hoard of Agriculture far th Lenefit of farmers. Sample Copies We send this week's News to A large number of Republicans in the county who are not subscribers, but who we think ought to be. We ask them to examine the paper carefully and compare it with other county papers, and we think its superiority will be apparent to all unprejudiced readers. Now is the time to sub scribe for the coining year or for a for shorter period if you wish to try the paper. Call at the office and sub scribe, or if more convenient hand your name and money to your Post master. The Emperor of Chin seems de termined to repel the advance of the French in Tonnuin, and unless France recedes from her position, war is inevitable. Large bodies of Chi nese troops are being sent to Ton quin. Bro. Alderman of the Marietta Register has started a semi-weekly. It is a handsome and newsy eight column folio, and will nodoubt prove a success as Marietta is now large enough to need something more than a weekly paper. The pressure for subordinate of- fices in the gift of the House ofRep resentalives at Washington, is said to be tremendous, there beingone to six applicants for every office to be filled. The Democratic majority are at their wits' end how to satisfy the clamor of this hungry horde of office seekers. The Annual Newspaper Directory for 18S3 published by N. W. Ayer & Son, the well known advertising agents of Philadelphia, has been on our table for some time. It is a valuable work of reference for ad vertisers and newspaper men, and does credit to the enterprising firm by which it is published. We have done busines with this firm for sev eral years past, and can recommend them as prompt and honorable. Miss Delia Amos, daughter of Gen. Amos, of the Sidney Democrat, is an applicant for the position of En grossing Ulerk ot the Uhio benate, which was so ably filled in the last Senate by the lamented Miss Lillie Darst, of the Circleville Herald. Miss Delia is a bright and preposs essing young lady, and has been as sociate editor ot her lather s paper for some time past. We hope she may obtain the position she desires. lne loieao Daily fost is a new aspirant for public favor, of which several numbers nave reached our table. It is a bright spicy little sheet and is furnished at the low rate of one cent per copy, or three dol lars a year. The publishers are Meisrs. Chapin, Brinkerhoff & Co. We have a pleasant acquaintance with Mr. Chapin, who was formerly connected with the Toledo Bee and wish him success in his new enter prise. The officers of the Republican National Committee have been visit ing Cincinnati and other cities with a view to selecting the place for hold ing the National Convention of next year. Cincinnati is the most central point, and her Music Hall is the best adapted for the purpose of any in the country. This with her superior hotel accommodations and other at tractions ought to give her the pre ference, though Philadelphia is mak ing a strong effort to secure it. Change in the Hillsboro Gazette. Mr. J. R. Marshall last week sold his interest in the Gazette to Probate Judge R. M. Dittey. Mr. Marshall has been unusually successful in the business management of the Gazette, and has made it a better paying con cern than any of his predecessors. He is a first-class job printer and it is understood has purchased an interest in the Springfield Sunday News, where he will have a wide field for the exercise of his speciality. Socially he is a clever, genial gentle man, and the removal of himself and family will be sincerely regretted by their many friends. We wish them abundant prosperity in their new home. The News cordially welcomes Judge Dittey to the ranks of the edi torial fraternity, and hopes he may find his new duties both pleasant and profitable. The Keys murder case was set for trial Monday and when it was called in Court it was passed until Friday. Owing to the sickness of Mrs. Taylor, mother of the murdered men, who is an important witness for the State, the case will be continued until the next term of Court and Keys will ap pear in Court today and renew his bond.

The Ashtabula Sentinel of last week proposes that the Republican mem bers of the Legislature should pay Judge Foraker the merited compli ment of giving him their united vote U. S. Senator, at the coming session. We heartily endorse the proposition and agree with the Senti nel that it will meet the unanimous approval of the Republicans of the State. The Sentinel says: is Its till FOR 

UNITED STATES SENATORâ€” JOSEPH B. FORAKER. We think as a tribute to worth and a slight acknowledgement for ser vices rendered, tht Republican members of the Ohio General Assem bly should present and vote for Judge Foraker for United States Sen ator. It will be a complimentary vote only, although we wish it were large enough to elect him. When the Republican party last spring were casting aoout lor a canaiaaie for Governor, men who were compe tent for the place, for various reasons were extremely scarce. But at the call of the people and his party Judge, Foraker took the nomination ana lea, wnat many Deueveu to ue a forlorn hope, and fought one of the most trvine campaigns a man was ever called to fight in this state. Although begirt with opposition from all sides, he made a gallant fight and by self sacrifice and great physical endurance he stood bravely to his work, and was beaten by so small a majority that even in defeat it was a triumph. No man in the State deserves the compliment on his mer its more than Judge Foraker and we trust the vote of the entire delegation will be given him as freely and una nimously as it was given our lamen ted Garfield. We know the vote could be given to no man which would more fully express the senti ment of our people. The President's Message. The News laid this document be fore its readers last week in a sup plement, in advance of all its cotem poraries. The Message is a concise, clear fnd able statement of the af fairs oi the government for the past year, and has the unusual and com mendable merit in such documents of being brief and pointed, which will insure it a far more general perusal than if it had been of the ordinary length. Tresident Arthur evidently understands the force of the old say ing that "brevitiy is the soul of wit." The resident's recommendation in regard to the Mormon question, will meet with general approval, and it is to be hoped Congress will carry it out. by prompt and effective legis lation. His suggestion that the trade dollar be called in and recoined at the mints, is also a wise and prac tical one, and his views in regard to the public debt are of the same character. He also makes a timely recommendation favoring the im provemcnt of the Navy,which merits the sanction of Congress. W refrain however, from further comment,as no doubt most of our readers have read the Message for themselves. Prof. Tice, the weather prophet is dead. He was 73 years old. The Annual Convention of the Ohio Bee Keepers, will be held at Columbus, January 14, 15 and 16. Washington C H., is considerably excited over several fraudulent life insurance cases recently discovered in which the lives of prominent citi zens were insured without their knowledge, by the Eureka Life As sociation of Indianipolis, a company which was driven from Ohio last year by State Commissioner Moore on account of crookedness in its transactions. Several arrests have been made and the whole matter will be legally investigated. The Ohio Editorial Association held its annual meeting at Columbus last week, and re-elected I. F. Mack, of the Sandusky Register as Presi dent, and all the other old officers who have so ably served the Asso ciation for several years past. Mack did not want to serve again, but the honor was thrust upon him and he was forced to submit, as the Associ ation appreciated his superior fitness for the place too highly to part with him. there will be no excursion this year. The Story of Puff. By Mrs. C. M Livingston, (Pansy's sister) is one of the most fascinating stories of its kind ever written. It presents the autobiography of a canary, its haps, mishaps, reflections, etc., in the choicest and simplest laungage, with a rare blending of pathos and humor. The dc-lighful little sketch is, indeed, worthy of comparison with the famous story of "Rab and his Friends," and will afford genuine pleasure to readers old and young. 75 cts.
