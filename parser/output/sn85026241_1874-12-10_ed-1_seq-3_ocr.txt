E. eu; Dr. John Cook, of Steubenville, at time a resident of this place, died Thursday, at the residence of his De Witt Danford, Esq.,BelI aire. His funeral took place at Steu benville, on Saturday. The Steul.en- ville Gazette has the following in ref erence to the dMttb: The doctor was well known to many our citizens, having practiced medi in the village of Kichmoud from about IS18 until 1857. Some seven or eight years since ho removed to St, Clairsville, where he resided throe or years, when he left there and came this city. He has been in p-.tor neaitn ior several years, but on last Saturday feeling better than he had for long time, he went to Bellaire to nee youngest daughter, Mrs. Danford, where he was taken worse, and died Thursday morning. The doctor whs about 84 years of age. Dr. Cook was a gentleman of far more than ordinary intellect being one of the best inform ed persons of our acquaintance. When practiced medicine he was very successful. He had the confidence and esteem of ail who know him, and his death will be deeply regretted by many warm personal friends in the different places where he has resided. He leaves ife and several children to mourn death. By reference to ouradvertising col umns it will be seen that the annual election of Directors of the First Na tional Bank of this place, occurs on the of January. Apropos to this, itj announced that theefficieutand geu-j tlemanly Teller of the Bank, Mr. A. Blair, owing to the inadequacy of salary paid, will retire from that position in February. We speak advisedly, and reflect the views of a large number of the heavi est depositors and stockholders of the Bank, when we say that the Board of Directors will make a grave mistake to dispense with the services of Mr. Blair, rather than advance his salary, say a couple of hundred dollars per year. Blair has occupied his present po sition for seven or eight years; lie is thoroughly conversant with all thedu ties of the Bank, and acquainted with people with whom the most of the business is transacted. His knowl edge which he has gained by these sev en years of experience in that institu tion is worth incalculably more to the stockholders, than is the paltry sum required to retain his services. We hope that the Directors at their meeting will take such steps as secure the retention of Mr. B., to continue as lieutenant to the able Cash ier, Mr. H. C.
