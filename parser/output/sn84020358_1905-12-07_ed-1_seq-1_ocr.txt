Whether she does or not I am in duty bound to provide her a comfortable support, and shall do so.

Notice of Appeal to the United States Supreme Court Immediately Given May Act as Further Stay of Execu tionCondemned Lawyer Makes Per sonal Plea to the Court In His Own Behalf Returned to Death House at Sing Sing. New York, Dec 6. After making a final personal plea to the court In his own behalf, AlBert T. Patrick, the law yer, convicted of the murder of William Marsh Rice, to-night was sentenced to die In the electric chair during the week beginning January 22 next. Sentence was pronounced by Justice Rogers in the criminal branch, of tne state su preme court. Notice was at once given that an appeal to the supreme court of the United States on a writ of error will be taken. The application for the writ, it is said, will act as a stay of execution. Patrick was returned to (he death house at Sing Sing prison to night. The passing of sentence upon the lawyer, whose case has been one of the most noted in criminal annals, fol lowed a series of arguments by his counsel who at first contended that the supreme court did not have Jurisdic tion to set a new date for the execu tion, the last stay in the case having been granted by the court of appeals and later appealed that sentence be de ferred at least until the appeal to the higher court could be perfected. District Attorney William Travers Jerome op posed all the contentions of the de fendant's counsel and moved for imme diate action. Patrick listened twice this afternoon to a rehearsal of all the details of his case by the district attorney. Once dur ing the proceedings he had been asked by Justice Rogers If he had anything to say before sentence should be pass ed upon him, and had remained silent under the direction of his lawyers. As the case neared a close Patrick arose unexpectedly In his place and pleaded to be heard. His action caused a stir In the crowd ed court room, and the lawyers held a hurried consultation while Patrick stood pale and anxious awaiting the court's permission to proceed. This per mission finally was granted and Patrick spoke for nearly fifteen minutes. His voice, at first a bit husky, grew clear er as he proceeded, and all In court listened attentively. When Patrick had been allowed to proceed in Ms own behalf he urged that there was no direct evidence that Rice had been killed and reiterated his claim that he had been convicted on. manufactured evidence. Justice Rogers then ordered Patrick to stand up and sentence was pronounced. The crush to secure admittance to Justice Rogers' branch of the criminal divlstin was so great that police re serves from several stations were sum moned to preserve order In the corri dors of the court building.

Young Leonard Turns State's Witness and Recites Details of Crime on Stand Plot Hatched in Brooklyn Dive Waterbury Woman a Party to It Expected Great Plunder and Got Only a Watch. Waterbury, Dec. . One of the most sensational confessions of a plot to murder and rob ever told on a witness stand In this state was that today of Edward Leonard, who, with Charles Bassett and Joseph Cenesky, are held on the charge of murdering aged Thomas C. Lockwood, who was sup posed to have ihad thousands of dol lars in a trunk in his home on the Woodbury road in the outskirts of the city. Leonard's turning state's evi dence was no surprise, as it was inti mated that he would do so. but the facts of the bold plot, told in every de tail by the indicted man, caused a shock among the persons in the crowd ed court room. Leonard said that the plot to rob old Lockwood was hatched in a Brooklyn, N. Y., dive at 146 Law rence street, and that a Waterbury woman named Lena Page was among those- who were in the scheme to rid Lockwood of his supposed fortune. He told of how the men were first In formed of Lock wood's wealth by Fred Preston, who claimed that he often had been to Lockwood's house, and that he had seen the great piles of "yellow-backs." It took a month to complete the details so that the "job" could be done with safety. They were to go to the Lockwood farm on the pre text of being a committee to secure names of citizens who favored the building of a trolley line over the road. Bassett, the witness said, first went to the Lockwood house and easily gained admission by showing a bogus list of signatures, and as Lockwood was sign ing his name to the list the witness said that Bassett dealt him a terrific blow over the head with his pistol. Lockwood fought his assailant, but in a few minutes was beaten almost to unconsciousness. When he lay help less on the floor he was covered over with a blanket and then the three men searched the house. Leonard said that all the men' got was a cheap watch. There was nothing apparently In the dastardly plot from the time it was conceived until the men left Lock wood's place that Leonard did not tell on the witness stand, and the full con fesslon created a sensation. The witness' story was not shaken by the cross-examination which took up the half of the afternoon. To-morrow Coneeky. Leonard's companion in crime, will take the stand, and it is thought will tell much the same story as to-day's witness hold. Bassett is expected to go on the stand late in the trial, when some ex. ceptionally interesting statements are expected to be made. KOREAN ENVOY MAY SUICIDE. His Brother Did and It is the Custom to Follow Suit. New York, Dec. 6. Coming to the United States to lodge a formal protest with the United States government against the establishment if the Jap anese protectorate over Korea, Min Yueng-'Tchan, late Korean minister to France, was Informed upon his arrival to-day of the tragic death of his broth- er, Min Yong Whan. The brother, who was formerly Korean minister to the United States, took his own life at Seoul, Korea, several days ago, a pro test against the Japanese protectorate. Min Yueng-iCchan was altogether un prepared for the sad news which awaited him, and he was almost pros. trated when informed of his brother's death. In Korea, when a man takes his own life it les the custom for his brother also to commit suicide. Mr, Min said, however, that he could not prophesy his future action. "I know it is not the custom in Vhis country to do such a thing," he said. "I do not know what 1 shall do. I can- pot say,". EOIET'S NEST STIRRED BY SECRETARY OF NAVY WOULD MAKE A TARGET OF THE OLD FRIGATE CONSTI TUTION. Suggests That All Relics be Removed to a New Vessel to be Named Constitu tionIf for Sentimental Reasons it be Thought the Old Ship is Entitled to a Maritime End She Might be Sunk at Sea by Guns of the North Atlantic Fleet Boston Indignant Boston, Dec. 6. Acting Mayor Daniel A. Whelton issued a call this afternoon for a public meeting of citizens to protest against the suggestion con tained in the annual report of the sec retary of the navy as to the historic frigate Constitution, which is now tied up at the Charlestown navy yard. In his report, which was given publicity yesterday, Secretary of the Navy Bona parte, suggested that so much of the materials of the preserft Constitution as can be shown to belong to the original Constitution be transferred to a new vessel to be named the Constitution, and that the remainder of the ship be broken up. The secretary further stat ed that if for purely sentimental rea sons it be thought that the ship is en titled to a maritime end, it might be used as a target for some of the ships of the north Atlantic fleet and sunk by their Are. The secretary's suggestions have been met by protests from many citizens of Boston. Acting Mayor Whel ton believes the matter of sufficient consequence to justify the holding of a public meeting. He has designated next Saturday evening as the time and Faneull hall as the place of this gath ering. Acting Mayor Welton sent the fol lowing letter to-night to about twenty prominent citizens of Boston and vicin ity: "Dear sir: You are invited to at tend and address a public meeting of citizens to be held in Faneuil hall on Saturday evening, December 9, at 8 o'clock to protest against the carrying Into effect of the suggestion of the sec retary of the navy to make a target of the frigate 'Constitution' and thus de stroy her at sea- "I -believe that such an act by the United States government ' would be an outrage upon; the patriotic sentiment of the people of Boston, who treasure the glorious' .memories of her prowess In the great struggle for the honor and dignity of thenation, nearly a century ago." . ' - ; Among those to whom this letter was sent were" Governor William L. Doug las, Lieutenant Governor Curtis Guild, jr., Jftstlce Oliver Wendell Holmes of the United States supreme court, Pres ident Charles W. Eliot of Harvard uni versity, Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Bishop William Lawrence of Massachusetts, and all the Massachu setts senators and representatives in eongresr. Mayor Whelton said 'to-night that the meeting was for all citizens, who by their presence would protoat "against the monstrous suggestion of the secre tary of the navy." NATIONALIST CONVENTION. Uncompromising Attitude on Borne Rule No Faith in Liberals. Dublin, Dec. 6. T,he nationalist con vention, so far as to-day's proceedings are concerned, resolved itself Into an uncompromising home rule meeting. Resolutions Were passed denouncing the government of Ireland, outlawing Wil liam O'Brien and his supporters unless they signed the party pledges, express ing disbelief in the promises of the lib erals, and pledging absolute support to John Redmond as leader of the Irish parliamentary party. The moderates were howled down and their speakers forced to leave the platform. The convention will continue to-morrow, but there is no evidence that the incoming liberal government can expect more support from the nationalists in the next parliament than the unionists have received, unless Sir Henry Camp-bell-Bannerman plumps for home rule. The declarations of the leaders and the resolutions passed at to-day's session mean continued opposition to the gov ernment until absolute home rule has been granted to Ireland. NELSON AND M'GOVERN.

MONROE DOCTRINE'S EXTENSION French Papers Stirred Over Passages la President's Message. Paris, Dec. 6. The Temps in a lead ing article this evening discussing Pres ident Roosevelt's message to congress says: "The Monroe doctrine is given extra ordinary proportions. It Is no longer confined to forbidding Europe to con quer or annex South American territory but is also extended against the simple seizure of custom houses which is the sole means of effective reprisal against delinquent South American republics. President Roosevelt did not present this objection three years ago against ithe triple action of Germany, Great Britain and Italy against Venezuela. Why has he chosen the moment when France may be obliged to adopt meas ures of the same kind against Venezue la?" The Journal des Debats also com ments on the extension of the Monroe doctrine. TO

I urged this action several years ago, but none lof the other companies seemed willing to Join in the movement. In issuing the order there will be no distinction, and every person not identified with the Reading or Jersey Central will be cut off at the end of this year." 1 As the Pennsylvania is interested in the Baltimore and Ohio, Chesapeake and Ohio, and the Norfolk and West ern railroads, these lines are alsoi ex pected to Issue anti-pass orders.
