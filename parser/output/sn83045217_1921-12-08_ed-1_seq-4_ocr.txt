THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. J THE president's message wan well received in congress. It met abundant applause, but it iü too Loon yet to predict what affect it will have on congress. He wants congress to do two things as soon as possible—send him a tariff bill and authority to settle up foreign indebtedness in a hurry. Both are likely to take some time. He ex plained to congress his idea of a flexible tariff rate that he could increase or diminish at will. There will be objection to that feâture of his message no doubt. His suggestion that congress purchase and donate ten million bushels of corn to Russia and one million bushels of seed grain will probably be followed, though this heaping of coals of fire on the shock haired Russian bolsheviks may make some protest in debate. It is expected to pass, however. Some disappointment was felt in corn market by the bulls because this probable purchase for export did not shove up the price of corn. It may do so later when once it is sure that it will be purchased and sent. Naturally the president did not say much about the disarmament conference now in session at Wash ington. He could not say anything very definite because both the naval disarmament question and the Chi nese question are undecided and in a rather critical stage. Perhaps, now that Lloyd George has settled the Irish question he might come to Washington and settle the Chi nese-Japanese question, naval dis armament and other problems that seem to lag. He would probably put more pep into the proceedings, anyway. However, President Hard ing tells congress that he has high hopes that big things will come out of the conference, and we all hope so, too. THE 

IRISH FREE STATE. THE unexpected news comes from London that a treaty of peace has been signed between Great Bri tain and Ireland on the basis of an independent dominion government for Ireland such as the Dominion of Canada exercises. Ireland is to have its own army and navy, its own parliament, its own laws, its own revenues and taxes, but recog nizes its relation to the empire of Great Britain and promises to be faithful to the king of Great Bri tain. Its status in the British em pire is practically the same as Can ada, Australia and other self gov erning colonies. The agreement takes the form of a treaty and con cerns all of Ireland, but provision is made for exempting Ulster if that section of the island refuses to come in under the treaty with the rest of Ireland. In that case, they are to retain their own parliament as at present and to have all the powers specified in the act of 1920, and a commission, consisting of one, named by northern Ireland, one by southern Ireland and one by the British government is to settle the boundary line between the two. The settlement is hailed as one which will establsh peace between England and Ireland and it gained the unanimous indorsement of both sides to its negotiation and also the indorsement of the king of Great Britain who has been an active force in bringing the settlement about. It has yet to be ratified by the British parliament and the southern Irish parliament. Such ratification is assumed to be cer tain by both sides. The northern parliament, at Belfast, does not need to ratify it to bring it to a conclusion as they have the option of coming in or staying out of the new Free State of Ireland, as they see fit. If this marks the end of the Irish question in British politics, it will be a happy day for Great Britain and a relief to the United States also, for continuons attempts have been made for many years to drag this country into the disputes be tween Great Britail fid Ireland and make their domestic «squabbles I an issue in American politics. American citizens of Irish blood are numerous in this country and their American citizenship by no means caused them to lack interest in the politics of their old home. Many American citizens without any Irish ancestry also sympathized with them and hoped for Irish Belf determination and freedom, and there were not lacking politicians in this country who found profit in stirring up the Irish question in their quest for votes. If it is now finally settled to the satisfaction of all parties to the dispute, many American citizens will be well pleased at the news and inclined to admit that Premier Lloyd George is a great diplomat and fixer. 

CHARLES W. MORSE. »HARLES W. MORSE was in ^lime lights some ten years ago when he went to prison convicted of crooked practices with relation to a big shipbuilding scheme he floated. He lost his fortune and brought down a good many smaller ones lyith the crash. Pardoned by President Taft because he was in a dying condition, he regained his wealth with marvelous rapidity and made another fortune with the same rapidity. Now he seems to be in trouble again with the government over shipping affairs. The Spring field Republican tells the story as follows: "Charles W. Morse simplifies the latest episode in his picturesque career by agreeing to return from France on Monday by the same steamship, the Paris, by which he arrived yesterday. He will not need to be deported as an 'unde sirable citizen' or even extradited as a fugitive from justice. "The past history of the veteran I financier would doubtless provide data for the former classification, if necessary. The latter classifica tion appears to be at least prema ture. At present, it is understood, there are no formal charges against him, and the department of justice has not made public the exact na ture of its suspicions against him. These are expected to be consider ed next week by the grand jury of the District of Columbia. "Morse's conduct in connection with his $40,000,000 worth of con tracts for shipbuilding during the war has been under investigation for some time and, it is understood, will furnish the material for the grand jury's action. Chairman Lasker of the United States ship building board is quoted as saying that 'the case against Morse will undoubtedly develop into one of the most sensational in the history of the United States.' Meanwhile, whether the Groton iron works, Morse's shipbuilding concern, which is in the hands of a receiver, will continue its suit of $13,000,000 against the shipping board and the emergency fleet corporation for claims growing out of war con tracts, is said to depend upon the referee in bankruptcy. "It is nearly 10 years since Presi dent Taft released Morse from the federal penitentiary at Atlanta, where he was under 15 years' sen tence for violation of the national banking laws. Surgeon General Torney, in reporting to the presi dent that the prisoner was suffer ing from incurable and progressive disease, said: In my opinion the prisoner's duration of life will be in all probability less than one month if kept in confinement, and in event of his release under com mutation of sentence, it is probable that he will not live as long as six months. "So the president pardoned him as an act of mercy, though in de clining, eight months before, to exercise executive clemency he had declared him guilty of 'fraudulent and criminal disregard of the trust imposed upon him' and to have keenly realized the evil that he was doing. "Morse's recovery was remark able. Upon his release he promptly sailed for Europe and after four months spent at Wiesbaden taking the baths his physician there told hime that he would live "Quit awhile." It was not long before h« was again a conspicuous figure in the shipbuilding world and in a fair way to bring back the days when in about five years he had acquired all the principal steamship lines be tween Maine and Mexico and was sometimes spoken of as 'the admiral of the Atlantic coast.' "In May last year, Morse was indicted with others on a charge of selling a steamship to the gov ernment of Tunis wigiout permis sion of the shipping roard, .but the, indictment was afterward* with The Haskin Letter By 

FREDERICK /. HASKIN WHO IS GOING TO DISARM? Washington, D. C., Dec. 3.—That the disarmament conference has be come a contest, in which each of the nations represented is striving to gain some relative advantage in naval and military Strength over the others, is now apparent to all who have closely followed the proceedings. Furthermore, it is no surprise to those who understood the nature of gatherings. No nation is going to dis arm as long as the causes of interna tional war remain unchanged, for the simple reason that they are bound to cause war ag*ain. A certain saving in taxes is the most that can be expect ed from the disarmament phase of the conference. Its consideration of the Far East question, on the other hand, may be regarded as the nearest thing to a sincere attempt which mod ern diplomacy has ever made to re move causes of war. Whether the attempt will have any success at all remains doubtful. France is coming in for a great deal of criticism because of her re fusal to reduce her standing army which she asserts she needs to protect her against Germany and Russia. It has been pointed out repeatedly that both of these nations are incapacitated for an indefinite length of time. France is accused of employing sophistries to establish her right to a large army. So, it appears, she is, and so are all the other nations. Her standing army, is all France has. She possesses no strength on the sea where she is outclassed by three other powers— England, the United States and Japan. Each of those nations is trying to get out of the disarmament conference some advantage in naval armament. Japan stands out resolutely for a ra tio which will leave her relatively stronger than she was before the con ference. She brings forward the soph istry that her peculiar position makes necessary this extra stregnth. The Submarine Question England stands out for reducing the submarine to the lowest possible stat us. Hemmed in on her little island, Great Britain is more menaced by the submarine than by anything else. It . . . , - .w T . nearly starved her during the v,ar. It S Ä frnÄÄ« ■' imnJrfhu finthJ «fw ' almost impossible. On the other hand it is not important to the defense of her short insular coast line. Hence large submarine flotillas and the de velopment of the submarine are the greatest menaces to England. She is in favor of almost abolishing submar ines. She also comes forward with her little sophistries. What a horrible thing submarine warfare is. The United States is not. so im pressed with this horror. Submarines are extremely- useful on the defense of a long coast line Like ours. We are in favor of a father large supply of submarines. Furthermore, the genu ineness of our desire to disarm was put to the test, it seems, when poison gas was mentioned. It was suggested that poison gas be eliminated alto gether from international warfare, as the most horrible weapon of all, and the American delegation demurred. It is said that our war department has the formula for the most destructive gas on earth, and that in the next war it will be our strongest asset. Are we going to throw it away? We should say not. All of this is no criticism of anyone. It is merely a statement of the inevi t--. No nation is going to disarm as long as the world is full of things that are capable of causing international wars. Disarmament will be possible when cause for international war has been abolished everywhere as complete ly, for example, as a cause for war be tween the United States and Canada has been abolished. And these causes for international war will be abolished when the common man refuses to fight, and pay taxes. A good many common men in the world are in revolt against bloodshed and taxes now. That is the real reason why the conference assembled. That is the reason for all of its bumcombe drawn. There seems no reason to doubt that his present health is not of the best or that European physi cians could aid it, but under the circumstances the government is hardly to be blamed for interrupt ing his trip. And the medical pro fession over here after all is very competent, notwithstanding the Morse record of Sugeon General Torney." Three Bid Dates Set for State University Helena, Dec. 7.—The state board of examiners Wednesday set January 7, 14 and 21 as the dates on which bids on university of Montana building con tracts aggregating approximately $1, 400,000 are to be opened.

Moving pictures and lectures will constitute the educa tional work of the exposition. 84 PER 

CENT OF TAX PAID. Special to The Tribune. Billings, Dec. 7. —When the assess ment books closed the last day of November, 84 per cent of Yellowstone county taxes had been paid. The amount was $1,386,173.58. about peace and fraternity, and for what sincere efforts jt is making to establish in the Far East some sort of an arrangement that will be less im mediately and obvioùsly productive of conflict than the present one. But in the main the causes of inter national war will not even be touched by the conference. The causes of in ternational war are the quarrels of in vestors of different nationalities over concessions of trade and natural re tional war simmers down to that of high ideals, as we all know. And we all know that none of them were real ized and that when the dust of battle settled the victors were seen to be dividing up, among their respective investors, oil wells, iron deposits, spheres of influence and little things like that. The United States went into the war with no selfish interest, but she came out of it with the financial mastery of the world in her left pants pocket. What Benefits by Victory? Yet how this financial mastery of the world has benefited the man who works for wages or a salary in this country, it is hard to discover. He either fought or paid for that mastery, but if called upon to produce his share of the benefit he would have a hard time doing it. So it always is. The common man never shares in the material benefits of a war, except in a temporary and accidental way. Those go to a few fi nanciers. What the common man gets is the fun of fighting and paying taxes and the emotional exaltation of engag ing in a great patriotic enterprise. That these things are worth some thing to him are evident from the amount he pays for them. It is futile to pretend that war has no appeal for the common man. If he didn't have, there wouldn't be any war. The com mon man's life is apt to be a mon otonous restricted affair. War may suddenly make it exciting, intense. War brings to a people an enormous amount of misery, but it also brings I an enormous amount of excitement, of j j 0 y ^jj e primitive impulse unleashed. ■' » nd of a great emotional debauch. It ' can scarcely be disputed that there is gome human need which war satis . to defend themselves. Every interna fies. Modern international war is the spectacle of certain interested parties working to satisfy that need and in so doing to promote certain profitable purposes of their own. The flaw in the system is that ever since the middle ages war has been be coming less and less satisfactory to the common man as a means of satis fying his craving for combat, adventure, and emotional explosion. In the middle ages war was a sort of great free-for all fight in which men encased in cast iron banged at each other with long sticks. Nearly everybody had a good time, and not so many were killed. A war could, and did, go on for a hundred years without doing any great harm. And then there was the Crusade's. Who wouldn't like to go on junkets such as those Then came the great age of discovery and colonization. Here again war be came a delightful adventure. From Cortez's subjugation of Mexico down to Custer's last stand, the conquest of the American wilderness was an heroic adventure that rivalled the Odyssey. Those wars had appeal to imagin ation, they gave the common man a real thrill, and they did not exhaust nations or peoples. Modern war is an adventure for comparatively few and a hurd. miser able affair for many, and it does ex haust both nations and peoples. It even sometimes destroys the men who ex pected to benefit by it. Even men of finance concede that the last war cost too much. Some <>f them went broke. And the common mau is disillusioned That is the great point. Compare the feeling in this country now with that which existed after the Spanish-Amer ican war, and you see where the real hope of peace lies. Snow Plow Releases 20 Autos From Snow Special to The Tribune. Missoula, Dec. 7.—The score of au tomobiles stranded in the snowrifts on the road to Lolo Hot Springs have been plowed out by a tractor snow plow. The plow, sent out by the H. O. Bell company, spluttered its way info Lolo Hot Springs amid the acclamations of some two dozen people who were tak ing an enforced hibernation at the place noted for its summer pleasures, but which, as a winter resort, they declared it the weeds. It was Friday morning when the tractor and two men departed from Missoula, expecting with good luck to reach the springs some time that night. The going was slower than had been expected and a broken rod, which had to be repaired, consumed a day's time. The result was the road cleaners reached their destination some 40 hours later than was expected. There were very few drifts to* be burrowed, but the snow had packed down so hard the tractor could not make the grade with as much speed as had been hoped. Fire Burns Ft. Benton Machine Shop and Barn Special to The Tribune Fort Benton, Dec. 7.—Fort Benton suffered two fires within a period of 12 hours Tuesday, the first fire de stroying the carpenter and machine shop of Hagen & Schulke, on Front street, early Tuesday morning, while a fire in the afternoon destroyed a barn belonging to Mrs. Charles Thomp son and located on Main street.

He had been working in the shop and stopped there at 8 o'clock in the even ing. Insurance will only partially cover the loss. The barn building destroyed was not covered by insurance. The premises were occupied by D. D. Pugh, but the livestock and most of the contents were removed"t>efore the fire had gain ed headway.

CAMPBELL SQUANDERED $70,000 SAYS STEVENSON IN OI L ACTION Former Associate in Kevin Operations Asserts Also That Head of Syndicate Mortgaged Casing on Debt That Does Not Exist; Petitions for Receiver. . Special to The Tribune. Lewistown, Dec. 7.—In an answer and cross-complaint filed in district rary-treasurer of the Gordon Campbell Kevin syndicate, asks the court to ap point a receiver for the syndicate, suing for $14,592.42 due him as fiscal agent. The answer was filed by Speer and Gerth and Norris. Hurd and lihoades. attorneys, for Stevenson. Charges that Gordon Campbell, pres ident of the syndicate, has "concealed and squandered" $70,000 of the syndi cate's money, paid into his hands for definite purpose under contract, to Which purpose same has not been ap plied, are outlined in the cross-com plaint which includes all the contracts and agreements, together with a finan cial statement of the affairs of the syndicate as of September 21, 1921. Says Campbell Got $123,000. Acting as contractor for the syndi cate, Gordon Campbell was to have received $100,000 out of part of which to meet the expenses of putting down a test well on the liocky Ridge dome to a depth of 2.500 feet, the complaint recites, and he has received an amount in excess of $123,000, including $97, 209.72 in cash, and expenditures made "for his use and benefit" of sums of money in excess of $26,000. Suing as a unitholder, Stevenson consents in the complaint that all unit holders who desire so to do may come into his action and join in the defense. A series of acts detrimental to the best interests of the unit holders are alleged in the cross-action, Stevenson questioning the recent mortgaging 1 of the casing in the well and an automo bile belonging to the syndicate. Mr. Campbell on October 27, 1921, gave a chattel mortgage on all the casing, 1,550 lineal feet, to a man named Güm mer, who has a right to "seize, take possession of and sell the same," the complaint says, "adding that "although it is represented in said mortgage that iï iui Houston Appeal for Disqualifi- j cation of Pomerov Denied ! by Supreme Court.

II. llous ton of Missoula county, it was decided j Wednesday by the supreme court. ! Ilouston's attorneys had asked n writ | of prohibition from the supreme court, j restraining Judge Pomeroy from of- j ficiating. The decision of the high court takes the form of sustaining the attorney general's motion to quash the appli cation for the writ. Associate Justice William L. Holloway dissents from the decision and Associate Justice Albert J. Galen concurs in part. Houston is accused of permitting gambling in his county. The case against him was brought in the court ot Judge .Tames M. Self of the fourth judicial district. Judge Self had pre sided at the trial of the former case in which Houston had been accused of permitting prohibition law violations and in which a jury had brought in a verdict of acquittal. Judge A. G. Horsky of Helena was called in by Judge Self to hear the gambling case, but the Helena jurist "was busy with a jury in his own district and could not take the position. Summoning of Judge Pomeroy followed. When the case was called. Hous ton filed an affidavit of prejudice against Judge Pomeroy. asking that another judge be called in. Judge Pomeroy refused to retire, but ad journed the case until the issue could be determined in the supreme court. It was argued in Helena Monday, and the attorney general appeared in be half of Judge Pomeroy and E. C. Mud roney represented Sheriff Houston. Ft. Benton Prize Corn Hint of What's Coming . \ Special to The Tribune Fort Benton, Dec. 7.—Fort Benton won its share of honors at the Miles City Corn show, when it secured the sweepstakes prize on all classes of flint corn in the unirrigated variety.
