Peace negotiations between the Hans and the Slavs are not making: much progress. Apparently they are encountering; insurmountable obsta o)es at the outset. Chief among these is the fact that the parties cannot trust each other. There are Indica tions that the Bolsheylkl leaders have heard from Russia's partners in the war. One of Lenine's conditions for a prolonged armistice is that German troops must not be withdrawn from the frontier for use against Russia's allies. Another is that the Teutons rnust evacuate Moon islands. The reply of the German military leaders is that these are terms of a victor to a vanquished foe. Another difficulty 10 the path of the negotiations is that neither party seems to feel that it la clothed with authority sufficient for the purpose in hand. There seems to be every reason to believe that there will be no separate peace between Russia and the central powers. In addition' to hearing from Russia's al lies the Bolsheviki probably is hear ing from the country. The conclu sion of a peace with the Huns at this time would be suicidal to Russia, It is now up to the kaiser to show cause why the injunction issued by President Wilson should not be made jsermanent. ;. The total number of deaths due to the use of firearms in twenty-six states of the Union in 1916 was 8.240, corre sponding to a rate of 11.5 per 100. 000. Of these deaths, ,386 were sui cidal, 3,241 were homicidal, and 1,613 were accidental. The suicidal use of firearms shows a decline as compared with 1915 and 1914; their homicidal Use decreased as compared with 1914, but increased as compared with 1910, 111, 1912 and 1915, and the, rate was the same as for 1913. The frequency of accidental deaths due to their use shows a slight decline during recent years, probably due to the adoption f a sane Fourth in many localities. , J President Wilson's attitude toward Austria, as indicated in his annual message to congress, is that of the tern parent toward his unruly son. The president said in effect: This burts me more than it does you, but it Is for your own good. The loss of world's tonnage from the beginning of the war up to Sep tember of this year amounted to 12, 000,000 tons, altho the destruction by submarine and mine was only 8,788, 080 tons. This is figured by estimat ing the unusual depreciation due to the exigencies of war, and including the ships that are held in port as well as the falling off in the world's ship building. If the war had not inter vened, the world tonnage would have been about 59,000,000 gross tons by this time. :"? The tone of the London press, in commenting on the president's annual message to congress indicates that he made a hit in England. Altho we en tered the war nearly three years after its beginning, ' it is clear that the United States is now looked to for po litical leadership. It may be that in the end we shall attain military lead ership as well. The attitude of our al lies is in no way due to the fact that ire are furnishing the money to finance the war, but is a tribute to the high order of statesmanship and dis interested loyalty to the eayjse of world democracy displayed by the president. Japan has euchred us out of the Hongkong market for cotton knitting yarns, according to Consul General &eorge E.'- 'Anderson, Hongkong, China. Mr. Anderson finds that up to two or three years ago American and British knitting yams dominated the field In South China, the United States furnishing about 80 per cent of the supply. Then Japanese spinners com menced to make a specialty of fine- oount yarns, and during the season of 1916 they, obtained practical control of the Hongkong market. According to the consul general, Japanese mills ob tained the trade by using low-priced Chinese and Indian cotton carried to Japan in subsidized steamships at freight rates fixed by the Japanese government and exporting the yarn made therefrom to Hongkong and other consuming fields under similar favorable freight conditions. Japan is not overlooking any bets in this war. THE NEW 

VOTERS. There are more than three million women of voting age in New York state, whereas the number of men vot ers who have ever registered for any election has never reached two mil lions. Ths suffrage victory in the Empire state, therefore, brings a large element of uncertainty into any spec ulations regarding forthcoming elec tions there. Whether or not the new voters will increase the weight of New York in national politics remains to be seen. Last year was the first time since the Civil war that the Empire state has not been on the winning side in a pres idential election. In the past, the two great political parties have regarded it as almost a necessity that one or the other candidate on the ticket should come from that state. Another important fact has been that as New York has voted, in a presidential election, so have voted In diana, New Jersey and Connecticut. So it has been, in the past, that when the vote of this state became known, as it usually did early in the evening of election day, the general result regarded as settled. But last year the precedent was par tially upset. New York, Indiana, New Jersey and Connecticut voted togeth er 'as usual but the man they voted for lost. It will therefore be interest ing to note, in the next election, what result will follow the addition of so great a voting power to the state's cit izenry. 

DAWN OP A NEW DAY. The interstate commerce commis sion, altho divided and uncertain in opinion as to details, appears to have recognized the fact that the time has arrived when something must be done toward extending aid in some form to the railroads. Among the suggestions of the members are a loan of money and government operation. In the face of the great national emergency, the railroads, by their own voluntary act, are being operated practically as a single system, and are permitted, under government pnotec- tlon and sanction, to disregard laws and rulings which long have bound them and prevented them from reach ing their highest efficiency. With only a slight increase in equipment. they have shown a 25 per cent in crease in transportation service, sim ply thru being permitted to operate their properties, by agreement among themselves, on a national instead of on a sectional or a local basis. But while doing this their rails and equipment are wearing out and they have not the meansto make repairs and additions to rolling stock. For several years it has been practically impossible to float new railroad stock, and even railroad bonds have not been well . received. Short-term notes and borrowing at high rates of interest have offered the only possibility for meeting pressing needs. There are encouraging signs both in and out of congress that the rail roads are about to be given a better J chance for continued existence. THE LABOR SUPPLY. The ability of the United States to get quickly and effectively into the war depends upon ability to release men to the armies, and at the same time turns more men upon the pro duction of ships, aeroplanes, heavy guns and ammunition. How can la bor be found to give the increased output that will shorten the war and save lives? There is no longer any .danger of unemployment, of substi tuting one class of labor for another, or reason for class Jealousy. There is work for all. There arc three classes of labor in the country that have not been fully drawn upon. The movement to employ high school boys on the farms was devel oped far enough last summer to show that there are further possibilities in it. Then there is the movement to utilize old men, who have dropped out of active employment. In ordinary times it is difficult for men over 45 years of age who are thrown out of employment to find new places. The employment bureau of the Employers' Association of Chicago' finds employ ment free of charge for men of this class. In the month of August it placed VSOS of them in permanent places, and in the month of Septem ber 1,600 of them. This is labor that without a special effort may be lost. But the big, potential supply of la bor far surpassing in quality and quantity that of old men and boys, says a bulletin issued by the National City Bank of New York, lies in the unmarried women from 20 to 40 years of age, of the class who do not ordi narily seek employment for pay. Here are several millions of alert, capable persons who inthe present social at mosphere will not work for wages, who are consumers but not produc ers. The' movement to bring these wo men into Industry has started, but it is not progressing fast enough. It needs encouragement and organiza tion; it needs not only the personal economic appeal but the patriotic ap peal, and the same social approval and pressure that applies to the enlistment of young men in the army and navy. In addition to all these there Is ever Open to America an inexhaustible sup ply of labor in Asia. To obtain it needs but the action of congress. TBS 

TOPEKA STATS IODBHAL Br rSSOEKIC 1. HA8KI.V, Director, WawhUstaa, D. C "THE SECOND DRAFT. Washington, Dec 4. In ten days the preparation for raising future in crements for the national army will .,(i heiHn with the mailing of first set of questionnaires to registered men. The mailing will continue for twenty days, and the whole process of classification snouia ds over in uuuw sixty days, so that by the middle of February we expect to have over 9, 000.000 men listed for service, each knowing his place in the line of call. The scheme for the second draft, and all future drafts, represents a great improvement and refinement over the system of the first . draft. It is based on the experience of that first draft, with the added ad vantage of freedom from the need for pressing haste. Jt is more genuinely selective, and it will result in drawing men on the whole better fitted for army service, and in less disturbance of Industry and family life. The scheme for the first draft was conditioned by the need for haste. War was declared early in April. Todav, early in December, eight month later, all of the first draft is not yet in camp. It will probably be well over a year before the last of the first drafted men has completed his preliminary training. If the process had been further delayed by prolonging the process of selection unduly, our first million men in Eu rope would have been a tardy con tingent. Hence as General Crowder says, the first was "hacked out with a broad-ax." The Selective Service. The only way to apply the selective service principle completely is to ex amine ' every registered man before selecting the army. This meant ex amining 10,000,000 men on the first draft, for which there was no time. So the rules of the first draft were framed to attain the maximum of speed with the minimum of hardship. Future drafts will be selective in ac cordance with the better way. Every registered man will be examined be fore the next selection is made. The chief means of examination will be the questionnaire, with the idea of which the country is already familiar. It is simply a booklet of questions, with blanks for written an swers, intended to snow tne local boards where each man belongs in order of liability1 to draft. If the board wants more information, it may summon any witness it likes. Under the new system, the local board be comes a court, empowered to anmin- ister oaths and take testimony. If the registrant is not satisfied with his classification, he can appeal to the district board, and in certain cases he can appeal again to the president. Theoretically, the principal of se lection becomes more and more per fect as the number of classes for the registrant is increased. Thus, if all the registered men were divided into three classes, with class one called first, and class three last, a certain degree of selection would obtain. On the other hand, if they were divided into thirty classes, a much greater degree of selection would operate. The order to call In any particular class is determined by the master list which selected the. men of the first draft, which is to say, by chance The more classes, the less is left to chance. The Five Classifications. . For practical purposes, after a care ful study of the situation, the office of the provost marshal general de cided that five classes would be suf ficient to assure the operation of the selective principle.. Since class five, the last class, . is ' made - up of' men such as alien enemies who are com pletely exempt under the law, there are really tour classes of registered men available for service. Of these classes, the first and the fourth will probably be far the largest. The first class will be called into the army first. It will furnish the men for the next draft, and for all succeeding drafts until it is exhausted in each district. The fourth class will be called last, and quite possibly it will not be called at all. The greatest distinction between these two classes is on the grounds of dependency. The system makes industrial usefulness secondary to the family ties in determ ining order of liability. The first division of the first class is the one which will make up the bulk of the class. It consists of single men without dependent relatives. True. there are fourteen possible grounds why such a man might be classed in class two or class three, but none of these fourteen reasons Is of such a character that it will affect any great proportioiuof the 9,000,000 men. The bulk of class four Is comprised in the first division of that class. which consists of married men whose wives or children are mainly depend ent on their labor for support. It seems probable that these two divisions division one of class one, and division one of class four, will be by far the largest of the thirty seven divisions provided in the new system. Viewed broadly, it is evident that our new arrr.ies will be made up principally of unmarried men without dependents, while the married men with dependent families will stay at home. At first glance this may seem a sentimental rather than a cold-blooded basis of selection. Viewed from the standpoint of military efficiency, is it not better to let u single man who is efficient in some war industry stay at home, and take a married man with children away from his family and put him in the army, if he is not pro ficient in a war industry? To this question General Crowder has replied with an analysis of the actual situa tion. How the Men Are Placed. Men skilled in necessary industries are placed for the most part in class 2. This class is not to be called until :lass 1 is exhausted, but it -will be called if necessary long before class 4, which includes married men in non essential industries with dependent families. But General Crowder points out that the draft, covering the ages from 21 to 31 years, affects only about 31 per cent of the labor supply in any given industry. Of this 31 per cent, quite a large number will be found in class 4 on account of dependent fam ilies, or even in class 5, because they are aliens. General Crowder estimates that only about 12 per cent of the skilled labor in necessary industries will be found in class two, which is it self a deferred class, tho not so de ferred as class 4. The new system takes the position that a draft on this 12 per cent of skilled labor is prefer able to introducing the principle of causing hardship in numerous de pendent families. Class 2 will probably not be large, as in addition to skilled workers in necessary industry and agriculture it contains only certain classes of mar ried men whose wives are capable of supporting themselves without hard- ship, or whose family income is not a product of the man's labor. Class 3 will also hardly be large, providing as it does for such unusual cases as men with dependent brothers or sisters or parents, and certain municipal and federal workers. Highly specialized workers in necessary industries are also in this class. The main classes promise- to be 1 and 4. Before class 4 is reached, the provost - marshal general expects to see additional men who have reached the age of 21 reg istered, and possibly still ' younger claSBes Men in class 4 are' not likely to Bee i.rvic. Thus, enormous as are the demands of this greatest of wars. so great are America's resources - of man power that we may hope to fight it thru without taking husbands from f their wives and children. fathers'' from their Questions on the above or any sub ject upon which the reader desires in formation, should be addressed the Topeka State Journal Information Bu reau, Frederic J.

" TWO WOMEN BT ZOK BXCELET. , ' Pin Pricks. Kerryville. Sunday Afternoon. You enviable Kits: I say "enviable" designedly. I en vied you ibecause of your very "trou bles" pin pricks really. Pestered by poets are you? How I begrudge you the experience; I, who for over a year have met nothing nearer a I poet than Lem Hicks, who calls his mixture of postoffice and grocery an "emporium!" Kits, if you send me your latest "troubles" I'll gladly put them up in my guest's room and tend them as poets truly deserve. For, Kits, I have the room to spare. Mother has had to leave. Her going was the condition of peace in my home. Such peace as comes from los ing the companionship of the one hu man being who best understands you and most cares for you! I am at "peace" now. Curtis and his mother have won. Mother and I have .lost. You know how we have always been chums. You know how much a woman wants her mother when she herself is a beginning mother. You know how little I have out here that can fill the void mother's going has left. Do you wonder then, that I envy you your "trouble" with the poets? I don't want to seem lugubrious. But you know there is no choice sad der, more inevitable, than that which marriage puts to one. Choose between the flesh-and-blood which nurtured you and that which you marry, says Life. I want both mother and Cur tis. I need them both. And I can not have them. Kits, if I saw the justification of having to give up one for the other, I could summon resig nation. But I see none, except the accident of Curtis not seeing my need of my mother. I could tell him of It and I have. Even If my words were sufficient to make him see. I should still resent that his love for me should not give him insight enough to realize how much need the companionship, the understanding, the experience, the guidance my mother can give me. But I have talked and talked and mother has had to go just the same!' What makes me so furious is that Curtis, a man, feels the need of his mother every minute. He has been her pet concern from the moment she knew he was coming.. It sounds bru tal, but I am flad you have no mother-in-law. If you had, you would know what it means to be shown daily that you are not good enough for the man you married. If Curtis's mother would only say It, I should find it easier to bear. I could argue, plead or at worst, make Curtis answer the indictment. But it's the unspoken word, the involun tary look, the thousand little betray als on her part of a conviction which she does not quite dare utter these are the things that stab and stab. Well, Kits, do you want to swap your latest trouble for mine? Mind, I have a little less housework. A lit tle more peace. Curtie is nicer. His mother a touch more indulgent of me, tho the smile I feel under her mask of complacence a complacence she emphasizes to prove that my mother was really the storm center. How about It, Kits, will you swap? But I hear my Consolation. He has Just waked and is clamoring for din ner with all the gusto of three-months-old lungs, which I'd have you know is not to be despised. So good by. Hastily. . MAY, )0ND AY SCTOOIL LI BY W. T. For December 9 Is "Ezra and Nehe- mlah Teach the Law." Nehemiah, Chap. 8. "Getting the Big; Idea Fixed." In a conservation congress held in the South one man made the point that it is better to get the great idea of conservation or what another called the principle of salvation, into people's minds than to teach them all the methods of conservations extant. Plans are merely the product of a purpose.- Methods are the output of motive. Get the big idea into a peo- pie s thinking and they may be trust-1 ed to And all the . practical outwork- mgs of it that are necessary. The best program of moral and national reform is a passion for righteousness; details will take care of themselves. When one of China's greatest states men told me that he. felt that his na tion needs to adopt Christianity, he did not have in mind any complete system of theology: he does not know anything about scientific theology. But he did see clearly that the Chris tian ideal, and the Christian spirit, are China's present needs. Give China the book, and let her people grasp its genius, and she will make port in her troubled venture of a constitutional form of government. Give her only the forms and -methods of constitu tionalism, with the old individualistic and selfish spirt, and she will make shipwreck of her great experiment. The clear need of China, as of our own land, is for a new life to vitalize the new forms of this changing day. ; Better: Than Strong Walls. The Great Wall of North China, or the walls about Peking and Nanking, are not any more obsolete and inef fective for purposes of defence in these modern times than were the newly-built wall of Nehemiah to keep out the most dangerous foes of Jeru salem. They might thwart Sanballat, Toblah and Geshem, but they were unavailing against the . selfishness, pride, idolatry and . godiessness of the wandering hearts of the Jews. The I need of the returned Jews was for the i protection that would save them from themselves. What says Amos R. Wells? "Closer is the Lord's protection, than a near Investing wall ; Closer than a moat about me, closer than a tower tall ; Closer than a suit of armor, or my bands and feet can be: For against mine own assailing, His pro tection keepeth me." , The Jews who had returned from the Babylonian exile were in a capital position to adopt an electic religion; and they had leaning that way. They were surrounded by an assortment of creeds. There were more gods than virtues. Most of the popular divinities were easy-going, asking nothing of their devotees in the way of moral straitness. There was free rein for all passions in the service of the gods of the nations. That is why the Jews were so often tempted to stray from Jehovah. A man is glad to cloak the indulgence of his frailties under the cover of some religion. , The popularity of all sorts of cults in our own 'time is to be explained in this same way. Their moral obliga tions are not rigid and exacting. They profess scorn : of the old legalism of the Mosaic law. "Natural religion" 'is veritable high-brow fad in our times. It is an easy creed. It. will let a man i indulge, his selfishness to any extent, ! so long as he is mindful to burn in- cense to the goddess of Good Form. Be polite and conventional, and you may do whatever you please within these wide bounds, says natural rell-; gion. which deifies the worst as well as the best of man's nature. Leaders, Real and Sham. Sir Robertson Nicoll, the great Brit ish editor and critic, once gave me his impression of certain public men on this side of the water. Concerning one famous man he said that "He manages to keep Just a step in front of the ctowd. and he is ever looking back over his shoulder to see if they are following." That Is a definition of many a popular politician; but the term "leader" must be denied him. The truly great statesman is the one who leads the way to what he believes to be righteousness and honor and public welfare. He is less concerned about people's applause than about their progress. Fortunately, Jerusalem had that kind of leaders during and after the rebuilding of the walls. Nehemiah and Ezra cared more for helping their people than for pleasing them. Ths. never hesitated to point out the dan gers which resided in the hearts of the Jews, as well as those which arose from without the city walla They were true leaders, not followers of the crowd who managed to keep in front of the procession, like small boys run ning at the head of a circus parade." Once the wall was finished, these leaders planned for a great festival of recognition of the law of the nation, which- was the law of Jehovah. It is the degree of a community's rever ence for law that measures its- real stability. A common misapprehension is that it is the volume of business that determines a community's strength; but this is not so. The strength of the law is the strength of a people's civil ization. Not without reason does the British poet of empire cry to his far flung fellow countrymen: "Keep ye the law; be swift in all obedience; Drive the road and brldfre the Ford. Make ye sure to earn bis won. That the reap where he hath sown ; By the peace among the peoples let men know we serve the Lord." . A Get-Together Meeting. Many cities in the southern and western parts of the United States have entered upon a regular cam paign of advertising and promotion. They have adopted slogans and em blems, and assiduously woo increased prosperity. The first step in every such campaign is to get the people together, and to make them feel their civic solidarity. No . committee of business men can boom a city suc cessfully finless there be present the genuinely unified community con sciousness. Ezra had never studied psychology. but he knew human. nature, which is the same thing, so nis first step in the great religious and law-observing revival wmcn ne projected for Jeru salem was to get all the people to gether in one place. He wanted them to become conscious if themselves, to see one another, and to feel the thriH of the "elbow touch" of which old soldiers talk. Into the broad plape before the water gate the whole as sembly of the people gather.- Wise is the church which holds reunions and socials, not for money-making purposes, but solely to promote his self-reatization of tne organization. The churches which expect to have crowds of worshippers merely by the fact of opening their doors, may take 

ELLIS a lesson from Ezra's procedure. He was Ezra, the great leader, and all the people had special reason to give heed to his words, but he organized and planned for this rally as thor oughly as churches make ready for a Biljy Sunday campalcn. It was not a one-man meeting; Ezra had with him a corps of assistants, judiciously placed. He was after results, and not after a reputation for himself. The occasion was a prepared one. an an ticipated one, and an enthusiastic one, for the "get-together" spirit had hold of the people.- "And Gave the Sense." A man was speaking upon the pos sibilities of Mesopotamia's cotton crop, but he tools, it for granted that his hearers were more familiar with geog raphy than was the case, so he was surprised when a friend said to him, "A man was telling me about your speech upon the possibilities of cotton in China" The speaker had not been careful to make his hearers under stand, which is as truly the speakers' responsibility as it Is the listener's. I Most persons listen to the Bible with out expecting to understand It as they understand the newspaper. Their knowledge of Mesopotamia is as hazy as their knowledge of the Hittites, or the lands of Paul's Journeys. A Sun day school teacher who exhibited with pride a map of Bible lands, showing Ur of the Chaldees as down In the land of Edom was not very much em barrassed when the mistake was pointed out. The assumption is that ail that pertains to the Bible Is some what vague and conjectural. One does not expect to comprehend the Bible as he does a book or travels or a his tory or a novel. That state of mind was given a se vere jolt by Ezra, who in this great Bible-reading assembly had the law read so that the record runs, "And they read in the book of the law dis- tinctly and" gave the sense, so that they understood the reading." No other book is read so unintelligently as the Scriptures. Philip's question to the Eethiopian eunuch might well be repeated to many a Christian at his private devotions, "Understand est thou what thou readest? Often the Bible is treated as a sort of charm or incantation, to be read because there is virtue in it, but not because it is understood. Some folk, following this good luck method, open their Bible at random for their daily reading, trusting to be guided thereby, tho it is usually the bookbinder and no the Spt?it who determines the pages at which the volume will open most easily. - The only Bible reading that is worth the time spent upon it is Bible reading which gives the read er the sense of what he has read. Otherwise, one might as well read last year's almanac, or a volume of cunei form inscriptions. The Speaker Who Made a Hit. At a great Philadelphia convention a few years ago a professor in Haver ford college read theScripture lesson, I have forgotten even the names of the distinguished speakers of the eve ning1, but I have not forgotten how Rufus M. Jones read the thirteenth chapter of Corinthians, as if it were living literature, and as if it meant every word. That, I fancy, is the sort of reading of the Pentateuch which the multitude of Jews alongside of the water gate heard that day so long ago. Small wonder that thev went and shouted "Amen!" and bowed them selves to the earth In contrition, and listened ror dear life for six short hoursr No sermons are long when they are messages of life, from llvine men to living men. Emotions? Of course there was emotion. There is always emotion when hearts are deep ly tsmrea. j. nere is emotion when a man tells a women of his love. There is emotion over the birth of the first born. There is emotion at the death bed. There is emotion when a coun try's call Is heard bv natrint Tho stirring of the deep always produces emotion, ana tne academic objection to emotion in connection with religion ia nine less man aDsurd. The lesson of this whole lesson is obvious. It is that the surest WAV to the most abiding religious revival is dv ine study or the word of God Give the people the Book and they ran iin ihi,,,i - n ml can do without an evangelist. The entrance of the Word gives light and life and fortitude and conviction and lowliness and peace. The people who have come upon a revival of Bible study have the best reason to be glad and grateful, as the Jews after the festival of study of the law. They celebrated because they had learned anew the Pentateuch; how much greater should be the celebration of those who have the living Gospel as their light and their strength; God's Volunteer Minute Men.

As the "whosoe?ver" . embraces the whole world, so the "go ye" embraces the whole' church. Christ's "go" is spoken to all who have heard His "come." No Christian is exempted from missionary obligation. The di vine plan is for the whole church to preach the Gospel to the whole world. We have not heard the Master's full message unless we have heard Him bid us tell of His love to the other people for whom He died. Not only must all send but all should go. If we cannot go to Africa or India or China we can be mis sionaries to our next door neighbor. All unsaved souls are included in God's mission field. Most of us set a high value on our selves. We make all life, so far as it affects us, to center about our life. Grant the same worth to every other human soul and we get a new sense of the importance of missionary work, which is altogether a work for souls. Only the saved are sent. This is a topic for Christians. It applies to none but those who themselves have found the Savior. We cannot say "Here am I" to Christ's "Go" until we have first said "Here am I" to His "Come." If we are not yet Christians, our present duty is to extend the kingdom of heaven in our own heart. Neither are we ready to obey the great commission until we have learned the need of missionaries, the equipment of missionaries and the need for missions. The unready are unfit. We must first be taught of God before we can teach others of God. Christ's love must constrain us if we are prepared to bear the message of that love to regions afar. When we hear God's call for mis sionaries we should remember that the whole wide world is His mission field. He may not mean to have us go to China or Brazil. First of all He wishes to find in us the willing spirit. After that He will lead us to a mission field or reveal to us that our present surroundings are the mission field that He has chosen for us. Somewhere Ood has a mission field for every friend of His, who is eager to glorify Jesus Christ. God will make ready the soul that is willing. . '- God will not let us preach for Him unless we let H'.m choose our field. Emotion may have only tears; de votion always has hands and feet. It is in vain to weep over the lost world unless we are willing to go iorth to the deserts to help find it. Tears are easier than toil, but the latter is the true test of our devotion. "Send me?" we exclaim; "why not my brother?" Simply because the voice has come to you. If God had called your brother the honor of giv ing up his life to the .proclamation of the Gospel would have been his. Now It is -yours. The call is a commission. They who hear God's summons are they whom He would send. Sin and death never tarry; dare we tarry, then, with the news of pardon and life? Wo who understands the call and has counted the cost, before he is fit to answer "Send me," must be Drave, loving, sacrificing, enthusiastic, and immersed in the love of God. Where Did You Lunch? (By Annabel Wade.) "Hello, Bob." oh, hello, Jane." "Bob, mother Just telephone from the country that Bhe's coming to town for the day, and I'm going to meet her. Can't you have lunch with us?" "Why, yes, I guess so. Where?" "At the Ivy Lane tea room you know, in 39th street. We've been there " A "Oh, yes; one of those frothy whtpped-cream places I know!" v"WelI, it's all right. Bob and mother loves their chicken pies." "I'm awfully sorry, Jane, but I've thought of something. I'm afraid I can't make it. I've Just thought of something an engagement you know. A business engagemept, dear, that I can't very well break." "Why, Bob, how funny! First you said yes and then you said no. You have to have some lunch, don't you?" "Yes, but I'll Just run in my usual place. It's right in this block, you know." "But, Bob, please come!" "I tell you I can't-" "I think you're perfectly horrid, io spoil my day iike that! "Oh, for go6dness sake don't begin that, I don't see what difference lunch makes. If you're so crazy to have me lunch with you, why don't you come down to my piace?" "I wouldn't have lunch with you for anything, Bob Lane. Crazy to lunch with you! I should say not! Not in that greasy little Italian table d'hote place, anyway." "Now, Jane, don t go and get all excited " But Jane had snapped back the re ceiver on the hook and she heard no more. With wrathful thoughts She hurried into her coat and furs and left the little apartment, where, as she thought sadly. Bob and she had so lately had a delightful breakfast. She hurried downtown to meet her mother. It was a preoccupied Jane who shopped that morning, and usually Jane liked shopping. That was why M.S. Carter, her mother, had tele phoned that she wanted to buy new furnishings for the living room in ber country house and wanted Jane to help tn selecting them. "What's the matter, Jane?" asked Mrs. Carter, as they" made their way from one of the shops to the Ivy Lane. "You haven't taken a bit of interest in anything we've done." "I'm just upset about Bob. He's acting so strange, mother. He would not have lunch with us today." "Maybe he had an engagement. You Z" m"e -f. Irom his ornce. know the Ivy Lane is a mile or so 'But first he said - he would and then he said he wouldn't, and he never acted that way before." "Probably the poor boy is rushed to death and just can't take time. Do be sensible, Jane.' "But, mother," explained Jane, "he called the Ivy Lane a horrled, old, frothy, frivolous place, or something like that. I think that was hateful." Mrs. Carter laughed. "Men never like tea rooms." she said. "Where does he usually- go?" "Oh, to a grubl y little Italian table d'hote down In Eighteenth street." "Well, let's go d w i there and sur prise him. He probably just couldn't stand the thought of lunching in a tea room, crowded with a lot of shop pers. There aren't many men usually at the Ivy Lane, vou know." "So you suppose that was it?" Jane's face cleared a little. "I thought he Just didn't want to lunch with me. But. maybe that it is. Oh, mother, you're wonderful. Let's go right down to Eighteenth street." Jane was buoyant Bob himself had suggested that they meet him at the table d'hote, she remembered. Yet for a little while she had almost felt jealous of Bob. Jealous! Of Bob! The idea was absurd. And, anyway, what was there to make her jealous because Bob hadn't wanted to lunch with her? A few minutes later a Jane with spirits restored to their usual cheerful pitch walked down the two or three steps that led from the sidewalk level to the Italian table d'hote where Bob lunched daily. Jane had been there before, and as the savory odor of the stew on which the chef of the little place specialized met her nostrils she suddenly saw Bob's objection to the whipped -cream sort of lunch she usually got when shopping. A good substantial meat dish that did make a more staying lunch for a man. And as she served corn bread and whole wheat muffins for breakfast and tried to have fish several times a week for dinner, she couldn't blame Bob for indulging in a luncheon each day that 'could make him forget war-time re strictions. Jane smilingly bowed to the pro prietor. "I'm Mrs. Lane," she said. "Will you show ns Mr. Lane's table?" The proprietor graciously bowed them to a corner table, where Bob always lunched. But Bob was not there. They sat down and waited. F"t v0b A not come. At last they ordered lunch and ate it. That is, Mrs. Carter ate it. Jane did not. She toyed with a roll and crumbled it with ber nervous fingers. 1 1 evemng sTomr And she did not even taste the won derful stew. ... ' , , .. ' "Jane, you're the silliest girl I ever saw," commented Mrs. Carter, as she ate the good things provided by their Italian host with a relish. "I really think that, with as good a husband as you have, Jane, you ought to show a little self-control and confidence. You are jealous now, aren't you." "I am not Jealous." flared Jane. " inly why on earn did Bob tell me he was coming here when he didn't Intend to at all. He knew I wouldn t come here; I never would have, if it naan i Deen ror you. - -au ihb umw intended to have lunch some place else." "Of course, what you're thinking. Jane, is that he is having lunch some where else with somebody else. Isn't . It?" "Well, I'd like to know bow I cam help thinking that!" Mrs. Carter lifted the thick little, cup of black coffee to her lips and then ate her last morsel of cheese. "When your father and I were young, Jane " "On, please don't go and preach about you and father. Of course, you never get jealous. But father prob ably never did a thing like this." Jane pulled her fur collar about her neck. "I suppose that hateful, in gratiating little man knows I'm mad," she thought. But the proprietor buw. d vith an inscrutable smile as they left the restaurant. When Jane got home she' first dek-. elded to make some sandwiches and It's leave them, with a pitcher of milk, on the dining-room table, and then go to bed with a pretended headache. But after she had thought the matter over a little she went to work to pre pare a dinner of unusual excellence. "I'll Just let him know I'm not Jeal ous, anyway," thought Jane. "And I'll never tell him I went to his horrid old lunch place, either. If that proprietor tells him but., then, of course he wont" Jane bustled about planning and cooking dinner. Then she dressed In a frock that Bob especially liked, and when he came in was ready to greet him with more than her usual enthu siasm. So Intent was she on her effort not to seem peeved that at first she did not notice Bob's grouchiness. But when he sat down opposite her at dinner she saw his frown, an unusual thing with Bob. "Where did you lunch today?" His first words were disturbingly direct. 'Why at the Ivy Lane," lied Jane quickly. Bob looked at her keenly. Suddenly the tables were turned and Jane ap peared to be on the defensive. Bob had asked her the one question that she longed to ask him, '"At the Ivy Lane, did you? What time?" "Oh at one; yes. at one.'"' "That's mighty strange." said Bob and a quick look of distrust came into his face. "Oh, Bob, don't look at me like that! I didn't have lunch there at all. I " , . "Well, then, why did you say you were going to?" , "I'd like to know what right you have to get cross about where I had lunch. Where did you have lunch?" "Why, at the Ivy Lane. I hate those tea rooms. But you seemed so cut up about it when I said I couldn't come up that I hustled up there, and then you weren't there." "Bob!" Jane was out of her chair and around at 1118 side in a moment 'Bob, listen to me. I had lunch -down at your grubby little Italian place. Mother and I thought we'd come down and surprise you and then you were not there and I thought " 'What did you think. Jane?" o l,h:J. don t know what I thought! But I think you're the most wonderful man alive!" (Copyright. 1917, by the McClure Newspaper Syndicate.)
