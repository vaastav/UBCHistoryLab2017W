ECHO OF DUAL TRAGEDY A Man is Arrested in Boston on Suspicion of Being Connected With Crime in County in 1915. George Provasiles, alias Brown, was held without bail in the Federal Court in Boston yesterday, on suspicion of having been implicated in the murder of Isaac Waldrup and ) Nicholas Coffimas, in Alexandria county, on January 9, 1915, He had previously pleaded guilty to two indictments charging conspiracy to import narcotic drugs from Canada. The Washington, D. C., authorities were notified and will send officers to Boston. Waldrup was shot dead when he came to the rescue of his daughter, Mrs. Matty Hughes, who had been hit over the head by a masked burglar, according to the story told by ' Mrs. Hughes, at the time Coffimas and Waldrup, were killed at her home in the county. The burglar then shot Coffimas, who had escorted Mrs. Hughes home from a visit to Washington. Through finger prints, a flashlight and clothing found in the Waldrup home, the police obtained evidence which led to the search of Provasiles. Deputy United States Marshall Chas. A. Bancroft found Provasiles in New York city, where he was conducting a Greek club, and through a ruse in. duced him to come to his home in Lynn., Mass., where he was arrested. . This double murder caused considerable excitement in Alexandria county and this city at the time. Chief Goods and Sergeant Wilkinson went to the scene next day, and after making a close investigation they were of the opinion that the dual murder-1 ers did not have robbery in view, but j that the seisure ot jewelry, etc., was to make it appear that the killing was the outcome .of ,a burjrlary. The scene of the double murder is in Alexandria county, on Mount Vernon Avenue, near Johnson's corner, a short distance beyond Hume school house. Mrs. Hughes said she had been in Washington,and had met Coffimas at Grand Hotel, in that city. She later entered a taxichb with the deceased and started for her home. Upon reaching her house she found two men there, one of whom knocked her down and brutally kicked her. Coffimas, was at the gate settling with the chauffeur, when, she was attacked. When she screamed her father came to her rescue, and one of the men shot him four times, Coffimas was subsequently shot and killed by the men Mrs. Hughes was Miss Mattie A. Waldrup, of South Carolina. VIRGINIA NEWS Paragraphs - Picked Up Here and There Throughout the State.

Simpson, arrested several days a pro on the charge of violating the prohibition law by bringing liquor into the state of Virnn in t.h? Police Court guild, (.aiiiw ? this morning. His counsel, Louis N. Duffey, stated that, his client waived examination and would appear before the grand jury. Simpson, it'will : be remembered, was arrested on the 1 charge of having in his possession a ' suit case containing bottled whisky. John Nelson, colored, was before ' the court this morning to answer the charge of being drunk and with having an unlawful quantity of liquor in < his possession. Officer Smith placed ! two pint bottles filled with whisky J1 and a half-pint bottle containing gin, on the desk. The liquor had been < found in Nelson's pockets. Robinson i Moncure appeared as counsel for the accused. The prisoner in his statement said he was employed as cook ' on the steamer Majestic, and he al- ( leged he purchased the liquor ir. 1 Washington to take to his farm on the 1 lower river. He reached the Majestic's 1 wharf in Washington too late to get > aboard, as the boat was pulling out ( of the dock. He boarded a trolley carl1 for Alexandria in order to get aboard 1 at this pert. Justice Caton held him 1 for the action of the grand jury. James Bradson, a white man, had been arrested for being drunk. He ( met a policeman last night and asked s the way to the station house. The I officer guided him to his objective t point. When brought in court this i morning he begged to be allowed to i go to his home, in Richmond, and c Justice Caton ordered that he be kept e until he became perfectly sober, when 1 he will be allowed to depart. 3 John Percy Blake, colored, was r fined $5 for assault. 0 appealed to Governor Stuart to ap. point a commissioner to investigate ] the high prices. c | Citizens of Page county met Satur- 1 day and adopted resolutions favoring 1 the issuing of $200,000 of bonds for 1 good roads.

Cross- 1 ing this highway about midway, it is ? proposed to construct a modern road 1 from the Shenandoah county to the 1 Rappahannock county lines, a dis- 1 tance of about 14 aailes. These coun- ' ties, have given assurance that they will meet the Page county road with a similarly constructed highway, lead- ( ing to Culpeper 011 the east and New Market on the west, thus putting Page county within easy communication with Baltimore and Washing- ^ ton.

Judge Richardson decided in the 1 hustings court of Richmond yesterday 1 that money left with the Stephen 1 Putney Shoe Company by Stephen 1 Putney, executor of the Marion B. Langhorne estate, was a loan and not 1 a deposit and therefore, is taxable 1 as intangible personal property. This means that the state is entitled to 1 a tax of 35 cents on the $100 and the city to a tax of $1.40. The amount involved was $160,000 approximately. The money was to be paid in eighteen monthly installments and was to draw 5 per cent. Had the decision been I otherwise the state would have been I entitled to a tax of 20 cents on the $100 and the city to nothing. STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM!

Mrs. James Daring Fauntleroy was regal as Helen of Troy, but her Grecian robe did little to assist the famous dame of public opinion; Mrs. Chester D. Hubbard, as Tennyson's Princess was splendid and her cos tume was more of an inspiration in I assisting with the present styles, j Mrs. Richard Gibson as Marguerite I was dainty and bewitching, and the J fastidous dame felt that her simplicity of dress might please some! ladies of culture- Gerturde, Miss; Minnie Henderson, might have been an ideal and faithful wife but her gown did little to relieve the situa-1 tion. Joan Shakespeare, Mrs. George j Smnnt French, was a most pert ! young woman, and continually re-1 ferred to the opinions of her broth-1 er "William," but her presence! could be better endured as her cos- j tume offered more possibilities than j nost. Mrs. George E. Pickett represented a Watteau Shepherdess and her costume was unusually pretty, but the pannier effect has been used so recently that it did not help Mad- i ame Grundy, but the solo sung; so beautifully was a treat to all.

The gloom forebodings, Mrs. Harry C. Griffith and Miss Stella A. i Hoblitzell, were most awe inspir-j ing and the dummy they had prepared as a travesty on the present styles was a work of art. This part was taken by. Mrs. George Uhler, who i was very wooden in her gesture andj was indeed "the dummy." Mephislo-| pheles, Miss Elizabeth Griffith, keptj reminding these excellent ladies that j such a character was still in exi.-:tance, but Madame Grundy informed hed that such a person was not recognized in "their set".

The equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee that will be unveiled next year at Gettysburg, is at last in place, and the project that had its origin seven years ago, when it was first proposed that a memorial to the great Southern leader be erected on the war's most ! memorable battle field, has been | brought to a successful end. All that remains to be done now is the actual unveiling. Sculptor F. William Sievcrs, to whom the making and placing of the statue has been the first care for more than four years, returned yesterday from Gettysburg after seeing the monument put in place and wrapped in canvas against the day of unveiling. He expressed himself as highly pleased with the manner in which the monument has been east by the Tiffany studios, and with its appearance as finally placed. Its sit! uation ,with reference to its immediate | surroundings, he said, is admirable. Originally, it had been the intention | to unveil the monument at the semi[ centennial Gettysburg celebration of 1915. Delay after delay occurred to ! prevent this plan. At first the sculptor found difficulty in perfecting a model of I.ee, and later, when the model was finished, freight tie-ups prevented its prompt delivery to the founders. It was not until a few weeks ago that the Tiffany studios, on Lone: Island, completed the casting. It is planned to make the unveiling a feature of the Confederate Reunion, which will take place next May, at Washington. The program committee will be asked to set aside one day of j the convention to allow the veterans to attend the unveiling, to which will I be invited also the Governors of sev| oral Southern States and their staffs, ; There will he a big military display, including.the attendance of the Virginia Military Institute cadets. BOOSTS PROHIBITION I : Profits of Big Richmond Hotel In! crease With Bar Eliminated Statewide prohibition was given a strong boost by Colonel John Mur; phy, proprietor of Murphy's hotel in Richmond yesterday. Colonel Murphy was conversing with Judge I). C. Richardson in the hustings court. He had dropped in to j sign a security bond for the Home for Incurables, in which philanthropy he has been long interested, and the conversation turned on the changed conditions due to the banishment of I John Barleycorn. "I would not return 'to the old order of things for any i (hing in the world.'' said Colonel i Murphy. I "Strange as it may appear, I find JI am actually benefited financially. (Since we closed the bar the hotel is ! more comfortable and the conduct of business in every department less troublesome than ever before. With the different expenses the bar entailed eliminated, I find we are actually earning better profits from the sale of soft drinks than we got from j liquor. So gratifying is the change ! that I have issued an order for the i immediate dismissal of any employe , who may be found drinking liquor i in my hotel or keeping it on the j premises." i | SUBMARINE IN WEST INDIES ! _____ Providence, R.

President Wilson read his annual message to Congress .today. Declaring the country "cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbance," President Wilson appeared before a joint session of Congress today anj appealed for ini mediate action on his program of "settlement and regulation of diffi. hpfwoon the railroads and their trainmen. Statement of the need of such legislation occupied the hulk of his annual message?the shortest one he has delivered. It recommended the passage of the provisions, included hut not acted upon in his last special appeal last August. At that time a nation-wide strike necessitated Congressional action. In a late addition to his message, the President urged the passage hy the House of the vocational and industrial education measures passed by the Senate during the last session. It is believed the President will either deliver a special message on the question later or take it up personally with the House and Senate leaders when a plan he deemed feasible has been found. So serious does the President regard the high-cost of living question that he has determined to keep it out of politics if possible.
