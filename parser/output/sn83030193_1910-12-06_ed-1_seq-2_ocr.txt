WASHINGTON, Dec. (. President Taft sent his message to the last Mtsiotl of the Sixty-tirst Congress noon to-day a little matter of something owr )5,000 words. As it first left the President's hands the ntMSagf w.is iiime ttUUl 10,000 wmds in length, hut he shaved it off IDOUl 10 per cent, before submitting it to the Congress. There was nothing new or startling In the message. On the subject of the tariff the President was hrief and to the point. He expressed him self as Igainst attempting any revision of the Payne Aid rich bill at this lesslon, He pronounced the I'ayne-AKIrich hill as one "that has never been exceeded as an incoiiie-prodiiciiig measure by a ii v customs bill ill the hi ,u. The I'realdtnt favora awaiting re porta from the Tariff Hoard hefure tinkering with the a.-hcdtilei about which complatnta have been made. He does not anticipate that the board will be In position to make any recom mendations during the current aeaslon. but hopes to be able, through the board, to bring 10 Ihe attention of the Slaty-second Congress facts ronccrnliu such a.hrdulta aa need amendment. Ills Idea Is to take up one schedule at a time In order lo avoid precipitating the country Into a period of industrial and financial unrest suclt ss attends a wide-spread tariff revision. rresldent Taft devoted considerable space to the Panama Canal, which he recently visited. Mo pronoaaced him self as unalterably In favor of fortify ing the Canal, aad gave bis reasons. Postal Banka Soon. The postal ravings banks system, ac cording to the l'reslilonl, will be started In a few cltlea and tuwna on Jan. 1 anj will be extended gradually, ateadlly and ayatematlcally. Xe recommended the adoption of the parcels post Idsa on rural free delivery rout, e at ones, with the design of extending It to the whole postal system. The lreldent declares that It Is time to stop legislating with reference to reg ulation of corporations and to witness the enYct ot u vigorous execution of ths law's aiicad on the a.aluto books. The exact limitation upon business methods Impoeed by .uw lie argues will doubt less be made clearer by pending deci sions of the Huprcmu Court. In opening ids message the President referred to the settlement of the tlsli- erlea dlapute, the p easant relatione ex isting EietWSen the Tutted Htatea and all civilized nations and tha Improvement of conditions In I'lilca with respect to American commerce and capital. He levlewed recent happenluga In the States of Central and ftouth America, but madg no reference to the iavo,uiiun In Mexico. The approaching opening ot the Panama Canal reader imperative, in judgment ol lbs President, the rneal of direct ate unship routes si ii' i the United .suites and Latin Atnerl-an countries.

Coa earning the flimneUtl condition of the hivernmest PrislJent Taft set forth tho following: "The final estimate for Ihe csr end ing June M. INI, as th-y ng bee sent to the Treasury, on Nov.

The Treasury Department has evi dently been a matter of considerable concern to the President with regard to economical administration and abol ishment of ohsoleto methods. Ileforni policies along Iheao linos already In ef fect have ertectcd a saving of eoine tlW.ouu a year. Collection of Revenues. The Preldent referred with, some de gree of satisfaction to the Improve ment In the collection of revenues In the past twenty months. The new met nods of collecting duties In I he port of New York, he Bald, will alone save the Uovernmcnt between llu.ouo.ooo and Ill.mi0.000 a year.

The Rivers and 1 lari'orasblil and p r uc itutiuiiig mil or lite last t ongress were briefly noticed In the message. The President said he ggnd them not t cause he believed them meritorious but becauae t.isy contained many goo.
