Gammon In tho Santa l"c rjiil roael yards at Nineteenth and Liberty streets last ulsht and robbed lilm in the latest approved fashion. They took every thing ho hail, except his underclothes, Kitks :iinl hat. It was a cold night, too, tho wind picicing and the around snow-covorc-d. The police arc puzzled lo under Mnml why the rohhers didn't do a complete job of It. Here is what Gammon lost: One overcoat. One wiili-tiii.it and vest, (lie p.ilr of trousers. Ono pair of shoes. Twenty-eight dollars in money. To offset this, Mr. Gammon saved: Ono new 'J-uit of underwear, Ono pair of woolen Micks, One lint, almost Kod as new; and His life, !! ought to lw thankful for that," mut tered one old copper, after hearing the story of Gammon's experience. The. way is lonff and the shadows arc thick and Mack in that portion of the town wheie Gammon met with his experience. Interlacing railroad tracks mi read like an illy woven wel over the district, and it stranger trudging through it with a lan tern in one hand lakes, his life In tlio other after nightfall. Big. lumbering box cars come booming out of the darkness and liery headed switch engines pant and roar ns they skurry hither and thither through the night. It is an ideal spot for crime's playground after dusk. Hut Gammon didn't know this, liecauso ho had just come to town from Topeka. Gammon, who is a farmer from Blue Springs. Mo., and was en route home, sot oft the train in the railroad yards and Hanoi across the Interwoven tracks to see ids friend, O'Donncll, who keeps a saloon at Seventeenth anil Genesee streets, which Is hard by. Gammon was trudging along (lodging box cars and feeling as comforta ble as It is possible in a new Melton over coat, a spick and span suit of black worst ed, a new jinlr of shoes and three silver dollars to jinglo ! his?-r"UF"r .pockef.-'.o iay nothing of J23 in crisp green bills tucked tnilgly away in his inside vest pocket. He was thinking of a steaming hot Tom and Jerry he Intended having with Ills friend O'Donncll when a big and grutt voice came booming out o the darkness: "Hold up your hands, pardner; here's v here you pay tribute." It was a litrce voice that pierced the night air. and when a shadowy outline with a shadowy revolver in a shadowy hand Klided Into his presence-to enforce the com mand. Gammon slid his hands up into the air above his head. Out of the same dark ness two more phantom-IIke forms, larger, taller, camo gliding as reinforcements to the possessor of the large voice. "Search him!" commanded the first shad owy form. Ono of tlio taller men sidled up to Gam jiion and went through his pockets as deftly fis ho could have.done it himself. Nothing escaped the riimble lingers of the rogue, not even the crisp, green bills in the inside vest pecket. When tlio men had searched Gammon, one of the smaller ones said: "Jim, that's a good overcoat de guy's got. It would suit you. He's got on purty good 'tegs, too." Jim was the tall man. He promptly took hold of Gammon's overcoat and pulled it off. Gammon begged the men not to un dress him In tlio cold night. "T'cll with you." answered the big man. "You make a break an I'll blow yer brains cut " , When one of the small men attempted to remove Gammon's coat and vest, he planted a big list on Ills jaw. This tickled the ether robbers, but they went to their pal's tiseiie and In Id Gammon while his coat, vest and shirt were removed. He was then compelled to seat himself on the snowy ground while his trousers and shoes were pellcd off Gammon mado a show of lesistance sev eral times during the robbery, but was each lime stopped with a grufT warning limn the tall man (to le still or he "would blow bis brains out." After I'limmon had been all but stripped stink naked, the highwaymen quickly with drew into the datkness, and up to a late hour the police had heard nothing further of them. ... A c'-ill wind soughed through the yards and it pricked like needles through Gam mon's underwear. For a few moments the latest vict'm of the Kansas City robber band stood peering through the darkness straining hi" eyes to catch a glimpse of the men whom he had recently enriched. Then lie streaked it across the yards to a switch light, calling as he ran. Several railroad men were colleet.Ml about the lamp and when Gammon burst into view his strange attire amused thoughts of mad houses and neglectful keepers. - "I v been robbed." panted Gammon. "Three men one tall other two short look clothes, money shoes everything-. See em" "Thev're not here." said one of the rail road men. Gammon was pr tty ee-itesl. but after he had cooled down mentally he re lated the circumstances of his meeting with the robbers. The railroad men skirmished around anil cot a pair of ruhlicr en.rshoes and a worn and f raved overcoat for Gam mon, who continued on his jouinev to O'DoniiclIV saloon, where he was titled out with ji suit of clothes, after which he cnlhll r upon the polhc to trll his slorv. He could give but a fair description of the highway men however. The polhe are In hot pursuit. A "More Opener Ten n" for TliietON. Te The Journal.

The Character of Yi.tyriliiH Storm, Which .tllght Have Itecii Worxe, In Sciclitilically .Sellled. "A typical sou-wester" is what P. Con por. the weather observer, called the snow storm of yesterday. And yet Jl'1' wi'"1 ,,ll'w straight fiom the north at the rate of twenty-four miles an hour. Almost everybody believed yesterday that the storm came from the north, and more than one man said, as he pulled his coat collar a little farther up to keep out the searching snow: "That's a touch of genuine Dakota weather." Hut yesterday. In the Dakotas. the sun was sjiinlng. and it was fair winter weath c r. which goes to hear out Professor Con ner's theory that it was a "Sou'wester." Mr. Connor explains it In this way: Tlio storm otlginated Saturday night on the bonier line between Texas and Okla homa, and began to move slowly eastwaid. At lirst it Wiis merely an atmospheric dis tui banco that set air currents in motion, but the disturbance Increased as the night wore away, and by Sunday morning the at mosphere as far away as Northwest Mis rouii and eiu-t to the Mississippi was at fectid by it. The storm e'enter kept on de veloping throughout Sunday, and moving slowly eastward. Sunday night the at mospheric commotion caused light snows, which became heavier toward morning and continued 'all yesterday. The storm center l..st night was over the Mississippi river mar the state line between Missouri and Kansas, and it was snowing over all Mis souri and In parts of Iowa, and over two thirds of Arkansas. Winds, Mr. Connor says, blow toward a storm center, and it was not because the wind was from the north yes terday that theie was snow. "11 came very near being a blizzard to dav." said Mr. Connor last night. "Three things go to make up a full grown blizzard. They are snow, high winds and low tem-lw-nitiire tn this storm we have tile snow and wind, but hick the cold, .lust imagine what a terror this would be if it was bit terlv cold. Hut as It is. yon see. the snow all melts as It touches the ground, that is because the lower stratum of air, near the ccrth. is warmer than the air aiiove. "The storm will wind up to-night. ' said Mr. Connor last night. "It will be fair and colder to-morrow." , Yestctdav's temperature- ranged from -ii tn .11. The mercury stood at 31 for lour hours yesterday afternoon. Then at 4 p. 111. it began falling about a degree tin hour. Outside of the Missouri Pacitie none of the railroad time cards was deranged by the heavy storm of yesterday. The night train from Denver on the Missouri P.ieitic was delayed live hours by drifts in Western Kansas. FOLDING BED BUCKED. IJr. S. G. Gnnt Cnme Within mi Ace of Having HIh Xei'k Ilrokon llnr- ing the Performance. Dr. S. G. Gant, manager of the University Medical college football team, narrowly es caped being crushed to death in a folding bed while visiting his old home in Cowgill. Mo., Sunday. The bed was one of those massive nITnirs that stand around the house during the day pretending to be a bookcase. The doctor had been in bed but a few moments when the heavy; top lurched forward, drawing the mattress and the doctor toward the wall with a heavy, scraping noise that aroused the household. A's'.-drr of the doclur'r. saw tho bed as It began to close up and ran to her brother's aid, arriving in time probably to save his life, although she was not quick enough to prevent him from being badly bruised. The top of the bed caught him by the neck and shut off his wind like a vice, tearing some of the muscles In the back loose. Members of the family hastened Into the room and pried the bed apart. A telegram was sent to this city for Dr. Jnbez Jack son, who went down on the first train. Dr. Jackson said last night that Dr. Gant was not seriously hurt, but that his escape from death was remarkable. Had hi sister not been In the room Dr. Gant would have been strangled to death ami It is probable that fatal injuries would have been in lllcted had she not been present to break the fall of the headpiece of the bed. Dr. Gant will return to the city to-day or to morrow. 

WORKING AJIEW PLAN. OwncrM of 'the- Tenth nnil Hnltimorc Site Still Hope to Secure the Convention Hull. Developments last night would show that interested parties have not abandoned the possibility of locating the convention hall and Tentli and Italthnore, especially if the soundings there show it to be suitable. A document was presented to many of the members of the city couutil last night pledging their votes for the passage of an ordinance detailing; the city workhouse force for the purpose of removing the rock at that point in tl event of its se lection for the hall. The force H to be un der the supervision of the superintendent of the workhouse and the roek taken out to be the pioperty of the city for use in grading and other street work. When seen by The Journal reporter the agreement bore the signatures of Messrs. Hrown. Wyne. Morgan and Munson, of the upper house, and Messrs. Simonds. Smith. Ilurrows. Hough, Heroth and Hrinklev, of the lower hnie'. It was stated that all the members seen at that time had signed the document with the exception of Wolf, of the Second ward, who oxpiosscd a deslie lo look' into the mutter before attaching his name, THEY DON'T WANT IT.

The expression from Petets that he is going to try and have the old government building at Kansas City.

Lender Hope to Secure n eloillllcii- tion of the lam PaVor n Stated Term of Service mid Abol- , isllllicnt of Life Tenure. Washington, Dec. 13. The outlook for changing the civil service law is being actively canvassed among Republican mem liers of the house as a lesult of the con ference held Saturday night. The mem bers of the special committee having the matter in charge are trying to to shape a bill that it will command the support of a number of divergent elements. One of these is the Democratic minority, which, combin ed with tlio Republicans opposed to the present law. would be strong enough to carry a bill. Hut in canvassing the situa tion it has been found that Democratic members would favor a complete repeal of the law, but would oppose anything short of a iepeal. As the Keptihlicau movement is not toward complete iepeal but rather for modification of the law.there appears to be no basis by which the antl-clvil service reformers of both parties can unite. It Is claimed, however, that a modification of the bill will receive the votes of two thirds of tlio Republican members and will have a good chance of passing the senate and recclvhiff tlio president's signature. Dr. Pearson, of North Caijolina. who in augurated the movement and Is a member ot the special committee says the essential modifications of the law likely to be con sidered by the committee, are as follows: Uxcluding from the operations of the law cases in which one government oliicer is re sponsible for the acts of his subordinate, as public collectors of revenue; examina tion ot those already covered into the classified service without examination, so as to put them on a footing with new ap plicants: change of examinations so as to make them more practical and less theoret ical; distinct provision against life tenure and for a stated term of service; affirma tion of the rights of heads of departments to remove, reduce or promote, In the in terest of the public: a limitation of the law to specillc departments, bureaus, etc., and an exclusion of those not enumerated. Another point that will materially figure in the discussion of the subject is the alleged rapid and unauthorized enlarge ment of tlio functions of the civil service commission. The opponents of the com mission assert that the original law was never intended to apply to tenure of olllce and removals, and that the commission, glowing from a corrs cf thrte commis sioners and several clerks to a large in stitution, has arrogated to itself not only the rank of a department, hut the power of dictating to heads of departments what action they shall take, anil, further, to employ attorneys to make pleadings, as in the case of the Virginia collector of in ternal revenue. An attempt will be mado to detlno the exact functions of the com mission. NO

Excepting the re porting of the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill, which is to be considered to-morrow, the house did no public business to-day. The entire ses sion was consumed in adjusting it personal dispute between Mr. Hepburn. Republican, of Iowa, and Mr. Norton. Democrat, of Ohio, which grew out of a controversy that occurred last week during the debate on the pension bill. The point at issue was as to whether a certain word ued by Mr. Norton, but which ho afterwards dis claimed any intention of using, should ap pear in the permanent record.. The house, by a party vote, ICG to 121, sustained Mr. Hepburn. GENERAL ARMSTRONG TALKS. Clilllriiiiin ttf tile llnwi.N ('ouuuisMion l-'aiir.H llfldicill luilinii Terrl- tor3 Legislilt Ion.

The estimate for the hist named provision was Jj.ooo. This is looked upon as ample to cover the Oklahoma expense's, yet many things arise calling for fluids which the committee never tries to estimate.

"I would issue long term -- per cent gold bonds and call those tenders in. Then the Issues could be made in gold ceitifi eates." "Will congress; take any decisive ac tion on the currency question?" "Sentiment in favor of its doing so Is growing at Washington, and 1 think the icMilt will be some kind of action along the lino of the president's suggestions."

Havana, via Key West, l"la Dec. 13. It Is announced scmi-otlicially that General Sanguilly, the insurgent leader, has writ ten to Marshal P.laneo tendering him his services unconditionally. Some of the richest Spaniards of Cuba have had further meetings here, at Cien fuegos and Sagua to consider the advisa bility of sending a petition to President McKinley asking for the establishment of a United States protectorate over Cuba, If, within six months, the government's plans for tho pacification of tlio island give no results. Havana, via Key West. 1'la., Dec. 13. It is officially announced that the Spanish foices under the command of General Pan do, in tho province of Puerto Principe, have been pushing the insurgent leader. General Maximo elomez. so closely that he was obliged, with about 200 men of his esco.rt, to seek refuge in the woods and mountains of Las Delictus. Tho commissioners sent by General Pan do to diffeient parts of tho island with in structions to negotiate with the insurgents for their acceptance of the autonomous feature of government proposed by Spain have not returned In a single case, which seems to confirm the report that some of them have been hanged by the insurgents and other have elected to remain with the enemy. It Is reported that Juan Delgado, the insurgent leader, has hanged the two commissioners who were sent to him with peace propositions. A dispatch recently received here trom Madrid says that the autonomic cabinet for Cuba will not be formed until the re formists and autonomists unite in one party, and it is added that the reformist deputy, Amhlard. who is now in Madrid, will, on his arrival in New York, offer to Manuel Rafael Angulo, a member of the Cuban revolutionary junta, a portfolio in the new autonomic cabinet, in order to in duce him to return to Cuba. New York. Dec. 13. At the Cuban junta headquarters, and from other sources here, it was learned that Sanguilly's loyalty to the Cuban eauso had been under suspicion for some time, and that his reported ac tion in offering his services unconditionally to General Blanco was by no means a sur prise. Delegate Thomas Kstrad.' Palma. however, speaking for publication, s- id that he could hardly believe that Sanguilly had capitulated, but that he did not at tach much importance to the report, even if true.

SHARP SLUMP IN WHEAT. I December Falls 7 l--i. Closing ltcloir Sl Hull Clique Said to lie Responsible. Chicago. Dee. 13. The wheat bulls began to feel to-day the effect of the prices which they permitted last week. The inspection she-el showed there had been a rush of gram In this direction from every quarter ns much, probably, as 4'.l."-0 bushels con tract grain in the forty-eight hours. A lit tle Inquiry sltow. d that the Inspection sheet did not begin to show all the arrivals. The majority of this grain was to till shorts mado months ago. Some of it had evidently been brought, however, to get the benefit of the Chicago December price. There was sciittered December selling, largely by ele vator people against new receipts of this sort. Armour was credited with more of it than any other interest. Tile- December bulls themselves sold more or less Decem ber, in order to hasten its decline. There was a remarkable drop in price. 7'y; but it was nccompauiid by no corresponding excitement and by no-great trade. Decem ber opened .-it Sl.i'3. sold between Sl-3 and ST'.ic and closed W.-e. The January option was intluenod by the Dec. tuber, as it has been all along, diopping fiom Mo to l'2':e. and closing at ffi'.ic. The Leitir party did to-day what their friends thought they ought to have done last week let down the Di ccmbcr. They did not sell much, because the market would not take much, and be cause Armour was selling enough lo make the price weak, but they finally helped to break the price. Everybody is still as tonished that December hulls permitted any such price as ruled last week. To-day's re e ipts cleaily showed the lesult of the Chi cago premiums. Minneapolis advices were that the Leit.-rs had people buying up there in order to Increase the difficulty of bring ing the Minneapolis giain down here. The elevator people are still ke ping the December bulls in the dark as to the amount of contract grain they are to get. Practically no delivery has been made by the big shorts. Armour and Weare.

Governor Pingree to-day gave out a signed statement for publication, denying that 3 cent street ear fares have proved a failure. He says that "the railway magnates damage their own business by saying that 3 cent lares do not pay, hoping to receive sympathy from the aldermen and mayor." and that the next move has been for the- newspapers to take up the cry. The governor asserts that if the $l.M.u"e bonds of the Detroit rail way were sold, the owners sot back all they paid for constructing the road; if they were not sold, they have received upon their bonds a greater profit than have most of the manufacturing concerns of the city for three years past. Governor Pingree says that a subsequent issue of $1.0u0,Oj0 bonds, which was made at the time of the consolidation agreement be tween the rival systems, was in reality a pure gift, made by the owners of the road to themsilve-s. upon which they expect the people of Detroit to pay Interest, and. eventually, the principal. The governor as serts that, for the last year, after pay ing interest upon all "honest bonds." there was a clear profit of more than G per cent to stock. CORN EXHIBIJF0R PARIS.
