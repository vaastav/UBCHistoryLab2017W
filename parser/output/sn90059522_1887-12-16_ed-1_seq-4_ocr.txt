Some very interesting information is being presented by numerous able j.en tlemen at the Minnesota Dairymen's convention in Minneapolis. But few people realize tbe magnitude of the state's dairy interests, and still fewer would admit without question the state ment that the dairying in its annual product ranks first of all the state's re sources. lix view of its importance, therefore, the suggestions that have been made at the convention looking to the further advancement of dairying are of the ut most interest. And none of them is more worthy of attention than that which points out the method of giving stock better care and better breeding. Science can be applied to tiie barn and barn yard as well as to the dwelling, and to the correct management of a dairy farm it is essential. There is no reason why neatness and order should not prevail in the manage ment of a dairy farm as well as the con trary state of things which is so gener ally to be observed. And as to the higher grading of cattle, that, the veriest tyro in the business knows to be all im portant. Just as the thoroughbred ex cels the common horse in speed the better bred cow excels her more lowly Bister in her milk-giving qualities. Minnesota has already won a com manding position as a dairy country, and the intelligent discussion of matters connected with the business, to be heard at the convention, is an evidence of the fact that she is going to retain it. BUSINESS VIEW OP IT. The views of a body like ' the New STork board of trade, constituted, as it Is, of the representatives of the business Interests of the great metropolis, are at all times entitled to respectful consider ation. New York is the business and j financial hub of the continent, and the prevailing sentiment in that center of our industrial life must more or less im press itself upon the business affairs of the entire country. The resolutions adopted by the New York board of trade at Wednesday's meeting may be taken as fairly indicative of the business sense of the country respecting import ant issues now uppermost in the public mind. The first resolution is an emphatic declaration in favor of revenue reduction. It is an assertion that all existing industries are embarrassed, and seriously embarrassed, by the diversion of money froni'business channels as a useless accumulation of i it in the treasury vaults. The resolu tion is in fact a ringing expression of opinion from the business men of the trade and money center of the nation j in support of the position taken by President Ci.evi.laxi> in his last an nual message. The second resolution is in the same line of indorsement, for it -agrees with Mr. Ci.i.vki.axi>*s views in declaring that while it is desirable to reduce internal revenue taxes, it is also not desirable to abolish the internal revenue system. The internal revenue taxes are levied on luxuries while the tariff duties are collected mainly from articles that are necessaries. An indi vidual doesn't need to have any vast amount of business experience to teach him the justice of taxing luxuries in -preference to such articles as are for the living and comfort of the people. The other resolutions adopted by the New York board of trade indicate that the business men of the metropolis are in close sympathy with business sen timent throughout the . country, and especially here In the Northwest. The declarations in favor of a postal telegraph, of the necessity of a judicious national anti-adulteration law, of the consideration of the subject of commercial union with Canada, and of the proposition to amend the constitu tion so as to allow: the president to veto separate item- in an annual appropria tion bill, arc all in complete harmony on these questions. These resolutions will not only have a good effect as indications of the busi ness sentiment of the country, but they likewise show that the business inter- ests are being aroused to the necessity for bringing an influence to bear on con gress in securing such legislation as is imperatively necessary to relieve the country from the dangers which menace it. C A 

KNOT'S COOK. The good Democrats of Paris and elsewhere are horrified because M. Cahxot, the new president of France, has engaged a cook at the comfortable salary of 12,000 francs a year. But let us not be quick in condemning fancied extravagance. May it not be tliat this somewhat expensive chef is after all an excellent investment? If his skill is to be judged by his market value, the new cook is undoubtedly master of his inter esting profession. And there is a very intimate connec tion between gastronomy and states manship. Suppose, for instance, a badly cooked breakfast should be served for President Carxot. The resulting irri tability would undoubtedly permeate his entire day's work and his usefulness would be impaired to such an extent perhaps that the course of legislation might be hampered and the best in terests of France seriously interfered with. Then, again, if the president's dinner were a failure, think of the direful leg islative possibilities accompanying a fit of indigestion or an attack of dyspepsia. At any moment a fit of ill-temper con sequent upon a rained stomach might involve all Europe in war. So that it will be seen that the cook of a president occupies a position hardly less impor tant than that of the chief cabinet offi cer. Indeed if they have such a thing as a kitchen cabinet in France, Car xot's cook is well entitled to be the prime minister of it. Because of their president's infallible digestion and the resulting clearness of intellect and serenity of temper essen tial to a wise executive, France can af ford to look upon ('..knots high-priced cook as an economical investment. AND 

IVES, TOO. And Mr. Ives, lately called Xapo lean, also at last feels the grasp of the law upon his shoulder. It is well. His name was very much needed on the list which though it bore conspicuously the disgraced names of Fish, Ward, Harper and the scores of smaller "boodlers" yet yearned in its incom pleteness for the addition of the young "financier's" cognomen. Now it is in a fair way to get it. The criminal proceedings for grand larceny— or, let us be plain, plain steal ing—have begun against the man who expected to make millions out of other people's money by the effective method of quietly appropriating them, and the chances are said to be excellent for giv ing him, as a sort of Christmas gift per haps, the punishment due those who wantonly defy the law and the com mandments. And though Mr. Ive«, the late Na poleon, has been able to temporarily re tard his departure for the St. Helena, whose other name is Sing Sins, through the readiness of his sister to go bail for him, it looks very much as though the trip would soon be made. He will find plenty of congenial company at the state's resort up the river, and if the courts do their duty a good many addi tions to the circle of thieves will be made in the near future. It is about time to show that the law is as ready to punish the man who steals on a gran scale as it is to bound the poor man who takes a loaf of bread to keep his family from starving. BLAINE'S CONVENTION. The convention of representatives of the Republican clubs held in New York j yesterday has something of an experi- j mental smack about it. something of the flavor of Fred Chant"* candidacy. The Republicans are somewhat at sea as to what the convention ought to do next year respecting certain ques tions that are now prominent. One of these is the saloon question, and the Republicans are in a wonderful quan dary to know what to do with it. As a sort of a feeler of the public pulse it was deemed wise to have a convention in ad vance of the one to meet iv Chicago next summer and try to unravel some of these knotty problems. But that was not all that convention yesterday was held for. It was a convention com posed of the representatives of the Re publican clubs, and when it is remem bered that nearly all the Republican clubs in existence are Bi.aixi-. clubs it is not difficult to guess that Mr. Elkixs had a hand in the holding of this con vention for the purpose of organizing the Blaink forces preparatory to cap turing the national convention. Shake si-eai.k to the contrary not ithstand- ing,there is something in a name. Per haps a majority of the mem bers of yesterday's convention were the representatives of clubs bearing the name of the Plumed Knight. Nearly all of the clubs represented in that convention were organized during the last campaign, and most of them took the name of their leader. They were Blaixk workers then and they are Blaixe workers now. The whole movement is simply a shrewd dodge to organize the Blaixk canvass aud to give it prestige. And it will effect its purpose. Every man will go home from that convention enthused for Blaixe's renomination. and will be busy from this time out setting up the pins to capture the various state delegations. HELPING THE POOR. "11. M. B." inclosed $5 in cash to the Globe yesterday, with a request t hat it be donated to the good cause of reliev ing the poor. The Globe has already received a number of contributions from other persons, including remit- tances from Edmund Bice, Jr., and other parties, who handed in smaller sums over the Globe counter, request j ing that their names be withheld from i publication. The Globe has decided that the best disposition to make of these contributions is to turn them over to the Belief society, and to ask that they be applied In such direction as Mr. Hi re n [______, the superintendent of the so ciety, and the Globe representative should agree upon. All future contri : butions received by the Globe ill be applied in the same way, unless the contributor should designate some specific application to be made of them. The necessities of the poor in the city are such as to make it easy to find a place for every dollar that is contrib uted, and the Globe is gratified that a generous response is being made to its recent appeal in behalf of those in need and distress. SITTING BULL'S MISSION. Sittixg Bull, the somewhat famous Sioux chieftain, is again taking interest in life. The tour of the Eastern cities which be once made under the auspices of a St. Paul man has left such pleasing recollections that the distinguished savage has never since been satisfied with his rather monotonous lot as the "savage ruler of still more savage men" held in a state of virtual captivity by Uncle Sam's soldiers, and consequently debarred from the gratification of nat ural bloodthirsty instincts. But tiring of the tedium which neces sarily accompanies the idle consump tion of government rations at a frontier post, Sitting Bull has evolved a scheme. When the lands were allotted to his tribe in severalty it was pro vided that the equivalent to be returned tothe Indians for the surplus lands should be in cattle, not in money. That was Sittixg Bull's opportu nity. Cattle was not easily convertible into firewater and otlier desirable goods ned by the pale faces. Money could easily be exchanged for the cov eted fluid, and such other articles as the noble red men might long for. A spirit of discontent was easily fomented, and behold the result. A purse of $5,000 has been subscribed by the credulous braves to send Sittixg Bull and a delegation of kindred spirits to Washington to protest against the award of cattle instead of money, and preparations for the trip are already being made. Who shall say then that the eminent Sioux assassin is but an ignorant savage. The securing of an THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 16, 1887. Eastern junket with a full purse cer tainly gives evidence of intellect of a high order. Many congressmen do not disdain to bend every energy to the ac complishment of similar aims. Civilization is evidently spreading among the Sioux and Sitting Bull has manifestly been the first to feel its in fluence. We wish him joy on his trip to see the Great Father, and assure him that in Washington he will find many congenial souls. aii A WRONG ESTIMATE. Unless he has been incorrectly re ported in a recent interview, ex-Con gressman Strait has a miserably low opinion of the intelligence and integ rity of the Minnesota people. Mr. Strait is quoted as saying that the peo ple of Minnesota are in favor of tariff reform and tax reduction, but that it didn't make any difference what posi tion the Republican party took on these or any other questions, Minnesota would give the usual Republican majority. The substance of Mr. Strait's opinion is that Minnesota Republicans are such a hide-bound set of partisans that they are not open to conviction.or where they have been convinced they are too servile a class to disobey the mandate of the bosses. The Globe feels impelled to vindicate Minn. Republicans irom this imputation. It does not believe that the party in this state is made up of a herd of ignoramuses who can be driven into the political market and sold like sheep in the shambles. It gives the Republicans of Minnesota credit for having as much manhood and intelligence among its members as the party possesses elsewhere. There are a great many Minnesota Republicans who are wedded to the Republican doctrine of protection, will stand or fall with the motto of protection on their stan dard. But there are a great many other Minnesota Republicans who do not sub scribe to any such heresy and we be lieve they will not be forced into sub mission by the crack of the party whip. If Mr. B'_.yin*e is nominated on a pro tective platform, as he will be, there are a great many Minnesota Republicans who hold their individual convictions above party fealty will not bow down to this modern Baal. __ae__. STRAY SUNBEAMS. "I think the Globe's criticisms on our system of sidewalk cleaning was unnecessarily severe," remarked City Engineer Rundlett, in talking the matter over yesterday. "I admit that the last storm caught us in bad shape.as up to that time we had no opportunity to organize a system. But now I think I have systematized the work in such a shape that there will lie no further room for complaint. There was a sleet with the last snowfall which froze to the pavements and became exceedingly difficult to remove. We were not pro vided with the proper tools either, and if our force did not make as clean a job on cleaning away the ice and snow as people thought they ought to have done, you can bet there was some ex cuse for it. Then, too, we had a scarcity of hands, and could not get over a* much ground as we ought to have done. "But, these troubles will not occur again,'" continued Capt. Buxiilett. "I have now a force of nearly 200 men, well organized and the whole work re duced to as complete a system as it is possible to make it. The city has now furnished me with seven snow plows. which will enable its to get over about fifty miles a day anil will give us a chance to reach all the outlying dis tricts. With the snow-plows and scrap ers it will be in easy job in the future to keep the streets and sidewalks clear of snow. Nor will it be expensive tothe property holders. The work of side walk cleaning up to this time has cost an average of a cent and a half per run ning foot. Thus, a lot with a front of fifty feet would cost the owner 75 cents for cleaning the sidewalk. But it will not be so expensive in the future. We will probably not have any more ice and sleet to contend with, and with our im proved facilities for doing the work it is going to lie done much cheaper hereaft er. I think the improved condition of the streets already should reconcile our people to the new law. Yet, Ido not understand why they should have birrtliened my office with the responsi bility of executing it. Still, lam going to do my best to make it a success." Despite his prowess, Mr. Weir does not I seem to have become very popular in the i Northwest.

RULED B?WEALTH. A Screed Upon Millionaire United States Senators. 1c To the Editor of the Globe. According to an estimate by Frank G. Carpenter in a recent letter to the New York World, we . have sixteen millionaires in the United States senate. In other words, over 20 per cent of the members of our national senate are worth each a $1,000,00.) and upwards..* This is about five or six more million aires than we had in our entire popula tion before the breaking out of the' civil war. When we consider that in' this country wealth is the basis of aristocracy and of social position, we see the significance of these figures.] The United States senate is our Amer- : ican "house of lords," and, like its En glish namesake, ought to, and sooner or . later will, be abolished as a useless relic of despotism. Every selfish instinct by which the average man or class is gov erned leads or inclines men in power to favor their own kind whenever a ques- I tion arises involving conflicting inter- j ests. Here we have a so-called repub- \ lie, resting upon the "consent of the gov erned," wherein the highest body of ! law makers represents in proper- i tion to its numbers a hundred fold more wealth and monopoly than any other body or class of men in the Union. Remember, we have but seventy-eight United States senators, , representing in the aggregate not less than twice that number of millions, or an average of -2,000,000 each. ' No other; government on the face of the earth has ever been equal to such a record. We j know how some of these senators se cured their seats, and arc convinced , that others of them owe their position j and their office to their money. But aside from all this we know — unless In J their cases all human tendency to self serving is reversed— that such a band Of men cannot understaudingly and im partially legislate for the great mass of laboring people, for they necessarily belong, soul and body and pocket, to an opposite and privileged class. If this enormous wealth of the highest legisla- , tive and law-making body in the nation is the result of accident it certainly is | the most remarkable case of the kind in , all history. It taxes the credulity of any intelligent person to doubt that in j nearly every instance where money has not been the power that has helped secure the office the latter has been in- j strumental in obtaining the wealth, and i this is no less deplorable. We see the j inevitable outcome in the gigantic and j aggressive monopolies tbat are combin- I ing in all departments of trade to crush out all that healthy and varied compe- | tition on which general business pros perity depends. When 1 remember ; that this condition of things has been j reached under twenty-four years of Re publican rule it almost leads a life-long : Republican like myself— who voted for j every Republican presidential candi date from Fremont down to Garfield doubt whether, after ail, we are in re- ■ ality very greatly indebted to the "party ! that saved the Union and freed the | slave," in order to increase the number ■ of white slaves, who are in bondage to a worse and more heartless system of. oppression than the negro ever dreamed' J of. In view of all this it is almost amus ing as well its sad to see an ex-senator, who is also a millionaire, looking out t from between the rubs and squeezes of; a ••massage"*— presidential training, school in Paris— bidding for the, J presidency by promising to "lift the taxi from tobacco" while retaining it on food j and clothing.

IN HER OWN DEFENSE, Mrs. Robinson Swears That She Did Not Poison Her Son, But That He Died at the Hands of a Doctor Who Court ed Her. A Wealthy California Convict Taking It Easy at an Hotel. A Bookkeeper in a Bank Who Has Stolen for Twenty- Z. Four Years. i Boston*, Dec. 15.— Tlie theory out lined by the defense in the trial of Mrs. Robinson as shown by the woman's tes timony day, is that Dr. Beers did the wholesale poisoning with which Mrs. Robinson is charged. It will be claimed that he administered the poison in med icines prescribed for the victims. In the trial of Mrs. Sarah .1. Robinson for the murder of Iter son Willie to-day, the defense was begun. Her attorney admitted that the boy died from ar senical poisoning, but denied that the drag was administered by her. lie de clared that Dr. Beers wanted to make love to Mrs. Robinson, but that a cool ness followed her discovery that he had a wife: that Dr. Beers gave Willie medicine on the day before he was taken sick, at ! his place of business. Charles 11. Rob | inson, only son of the prisoner, testified that Dr. Beers gave him a lot of pow i ders for Lizzie, his sister, and that he ! cave Willie some white pills. Witness refused to take any of them when re : quested to do so by Dr. Beers. Witness" mother was always very kind to her , children. Several persons corroborated the testimony as to Mrs. Robinson's af fection for her family. Mrs. Robinson, the prisoner, then took the stand. i She tirst gave her life in de | tail up to the death of her i children, then her acquaintance with j Beers and Smith, and annuel with the i former when she ascertained he had a j wife. After a visit witness made to Natick with Mr. Smith Dr. Beers was j very jealous ami threatened to put wit ness out of the way. He said he had enough in his vest pocket to kill wit ness, himself and a dozen others. Mrs. Robinson said that Willie bad told her he had lent to Dr. Beers *4<>o or 8500 and had the latter's note for it. j Witness said she never at any time ad j ministered any arsenic or drug toiler j son. never bought any, never saw any • arsenic to her own knowledge, and did not know its appearance or properties. I She testified that she had always been ' opposed to Willies joining the colony < of Pilgrim Fathers. The court then ad journed until to.morrow. A WEALTHY CONVICT. He is Discovered Living at a Hotel Instead of in Jail. Sax Fi.A.vr Dec. 15.— James llarkins, who was supposed to be serv ing a sentence of twelve months' im prisonment in the county jail at San ■ Jose, has been discovered walking I around the city. llarkins, who is known as "Uncle Jimmy," is the head of the : opium smuggling ring, which a few years ago controlled the custom house and, the United States court commis sioners, and conducted operations on a ! scale that made the conspirators very wealthy. llarkins owns three large ranches in the best part of Santa Cruz County. The clime on which fie was convicted was the bribing of United States Court Commissioner O'Brien to discharge two boatmen caught smug gling some ._• "3,000 worth of opium from a Pacific Mail steamer lying in San Francisco bay. O'Brien was once in- I dieted for receiving the money, but was ' not convicted: He maintained that the 1 money was merely borrowed from llar kins, who showed a note to that effect. | Since then O'Brien baa steadily de scended in the social and financial scale, ; and, though a young man, is a complete wreck. Some months ago he confessed | that lie had perjured himself at the first i examination, and had been bribed by [ Harkins. llarkins was Indicted and I sentenced to one year's imprisonment ! by Judge Hoffman of the United States district court. He was given bis choice ' of jails, and selected that of San Jose. , Yesterday he was seen strolling around : the town' without a guard, ami inquiry reveals the fact that he is boarding at the leading hotel in the city, goes riding every afternoon on the fashionable drive, and spends days without surveil lance at the duck shooting grounds of a club five miles Irom the city. STEALING FOX YEARS. A Bank Bookkeeper Canght After a Long Career or Theft. Piiiladklpuia, Dec. 15.— Joseph ; Knight, bookkeeper of the Manufactur ers National bank, was taken before ' United States Commissioner Edwards j this afternoon charged with stealing | from the funds of the bank between 160,000 and 970.000. The officers of the bank kiscovered Knight's delinquencies several weeks ago. They placed the case in the hands of the Pinkerton agency, and Knight was arrested a few : days ago. Tin' matter was kept quiet i the bank until to-day. II is said that ! Knight has been appropriating to his own use the bank's money for nearly twenty-five, years. Mr. Knight was j bookkeeper of the Manufacturers' bank for thirty-five years, and has always been considered a trustworthy man. John W.

BOOM SET GOING. Continued From First Page. ing for Dakota the right to divide in two states are claiming a greater power for the territory than any state in the Union has under the constitution. llowever,if at any time in the future the people of Dakota become so numerous that their material interests would be best subserved by division, the legislature of the state and the congress of the United States act ing in con junction can secure such di vision. Those who are wedded to the idea of division may well postpone the realization of their hopes until a more convenient season, for I CAU ASSII.K THEM from my knowledge of public sentiment here that the division of Dakota at this time and the erection of two states within her borders is Utterly impossible. I have been assailed in some quarters for having opposed the admission of Dakota into the Union. Such criticisms are unjust and without foundation. I have frequently desired, and still desire the admission of Dakota into the Union as one state, but have opposed and will continue to oppose her dis memberment. While some of her cit izens, perhaps interested in cer tain localities that may be affected by division, may criticise my course at this time yet 1 feel assured that hereafter those who have inisisted upon single admis sion will be regarded as the benefactors of the ; territory. After Dakota shall have been admitted into the Union, and take her place in the sisterhood of states, the magnitude of her domain, the greatness of her resources ami the courage and indomitable pluck of her people will inspire in every citizen a just and laudable pride. It will be the boast of the thousands, and perhaps millions, of our citizens who may hereafter reside within your jurisdiction, that they are the citizens of a great state, and in na tional conventions of political parties. in the halls of con gress, and in the commercial bodies of the- world her representatives will be accorded that distinguished position which the importance of the state will demand. I have faith in the future of Dakota. She is destined to take her place very soon in the galaxy of out states, as one of the greatest and most prosperous in the Union. I therefore bid you godspeed in the work of the con vention of the loth of December, and trust that its labor will result in the early admission of Dakota as a state in the Union. I have the honor to be very respectfully your obedient ser vant, William M. Sprixger. The convention confined itself strictly to statehood matters, only passing the customary resolutions of thanks. A resolution favoring the OPEXIXG OK THE Slot's RESERVATIOX was laid upon the table. The conven tion adjourned at 10 to-night. Every-* body feels well over the outcome." The work was begun in good shape and they propose to follow it up to win. Maj. Edwards went home on an early train. lie felt somewhat sore, as it seemed to be the avowed purpose of the Cass county delegation to whip him at every turn possible. The secret of his opposition to Greene ami the state was probably in the fact that he thought Benton was booked for Washington. After the close of the convention, your correspondent inter viewed Mr. Wright, of Minnehaha county, relative to his opposition to the members at large on the committee to the present memorial to congress. He said: -"Why there was nothing personal in it. It was not those men I was after. Capt. McCormack is a personal friend of mine. 1 made objection simply to please some of the Minnehaha delega tion who opposed other members on the committee. Winsor is not popular with some and then there is Gale. He is not as popular as he ought to lie. To tell you the truth, I admit that it was simply a local point. I.wished to gain the discussion, and may. have seemed to indicate a feeling against MeCormick, but I assure yon there is none. I would prefer that gentleman to almost any other. lam no kicker and I want it understood that I am satisfied, and will work as hard as anybody to the end. If desired I will be in Wash ington myself this winter and as sist in every way I can. I am satisfied "with the result. 1 did not make the point I was after and its all right." Dan Maratta arrived this afternoon, and some of the oppo sition to McCormack can 'safely be at tributed to him. Most of the delegates are still in the city, but will leave on early trains. : ■ ' ________ A Savage Encounter. New York.

The doorkeeper, however, consented to take in their cards at once, but did not hold out much hope for success. There upon Mr. Collins wrote a brief note to the president, explaining their errand and promising, if received, not to detain him very Jong.

Washington, Dec. 15.— Among the papers laid before the senate was a com munication from Italian residents of Washington proposing to present to the United States a marble bust of Gari baldi as "a link in the chain of sympa thy which all free men feel for the champions of liberty and republican government."

Wasiiixgtox, Dec. 15.— Ex-Senator Spooner, of Wisconsin, is a member of the committee on the improvement of the Potomac river front. He is a great horseback rider, and has ridden all along the river front and personally in vestigated many of the minor matters of detail which are sure to come up be fore the committee. The entire coun try ought to be interested in this mat ter. The condition of the river front of the national capital is one of vast mo ment. The health of the social metrop olis and legal crypt of the country is of universal interest. Until the Poto mae river shall have received ail the at tention which science, skill and wealth can give it, the malarial atmosphere will certainly increase year by year. I's Pension Bill. Special to the Globe. Wasiiixgtox, Dec. 15.—Congress man Mac Donald will introduce a pen sion bill which will cause the liveliest discussion on both sides of the chamber of any bill ever introduced upon the subject.

Wasiiixgtox, Dec. 15.— Senator Davis has shown an aggressive spirit which augers well for his senatorial ca reer. On Monday last he was on his feet like an old member, and submitted his views like a veteran.

Washixgtox*, Dec. 15.— presi dent pro Item, John J. Ingalls, of Kan sas, has determined to play the great anonymous act. He will soon follow in the path marked so strongly by Benja min Disraeli, and so feebly by Cynthia Cleveland. That is to say, he will pub lish a political novel, and give his ene mies fits under assumed names. Holman's Preference. Washixgtox, Dec. 15.—Representa tive Holman has requested that he be not reappointed to the appropriation committee, but that he be given a place on some committee having no control whatever over the expenditure of public money.

Eldorado, Kan., Dec. 15.— Prom certain movements of gentlemen who are well posted, it appears that there is being secretly organized an immense scheme to make a raid on Oklahoma in the early spring. This movement ex tends over two or three states, the ar rangement being that the way to open the Indian territory to settlement is to open it. They say that 100.000 men will go into the territory at a given time, and that the government has not enough troops to keep them out. One of the leaders of the scheme lives here, and says they mean business from now on. 

WALKING-STICKS. The Overtaxed Strength of Dude- dom Will be Relieved. "The fashionable walking-sticks for this fall and winter will not be as large as they were last year," said a salesman in a Broadway shop. "The swell youths who carried those telegraph poles all last winter found themselves pulled down in flesh when spring came. The result is that the medium-weight sticks will be most in demand this season. The plain styles are selling best now. The English hazel and French crab sticks, with medium-sized silver caps, are popular, and ash, alive, or ange and snakewood, with crooks and knobs all in one piece, are correct for all but dress occasions. Crooks and crutches of buckborn are still very pop ular, and some new sticks are made of American laurel, which, by the way, conies from Mexico. Old English oak is also in use this season, and is as stylish for canes as it is for house decorations. "Silver-deposit canes came out this year, and are in great demand. They are made fas covering the wood with graphite to make it a conductor of elec tricity and then electro-plating the top. "A great many gentlemen this year have cut articles for themselves where they have been summering,and brought them to us to have the silver deposit put on them. We have to keep a large vari ety of fantastic styles, such as demons, dragons, harlequins and clowns. These are all in silver, and some are very ef fective, as, for instance, this one of a skull with a lizard crawling on it. An other skull cane has emeralds for eyes, and the lower jaw pivoted so that it opens and shuts as you move the stick. We get the London and Paris designs as soon as they come out. and we im port some of the class of sticks that we think will sell. There are more homo designs sold than imported ones." Cushion Caroms. Four games were played in the cushion-caroms tournament last even ing, Hoa for the first time leading all competitors by winning his seventh consecutive game. Mallette easily de feated Smith in the first game by ascoro of 70 to 34. Then Hoa crossed cues with Miller and quickly made the neces sary 100, while his opponent could mus ter but 32 points, when the game ended. Buns of 17, 16 and 10 marked the forty three innings that Hoa consumed, and his average was about 2><f. As usual Wolf son was too nervous to play well, and fell an easy victim to Waterman, the figures being 00 to 39, and Colin closed the sport of the even ing by defeating Len Bensinger 00 to 51. Found at De Young's. it is reported at police headquarters, Minneapolis, that the overcoats and a lady's cloak stolen from the Free Will Baptist church Tuesday nightwere taken to the pawn shop of Harry de Young, at 212 Washington avenue south, and hocked Wednesday.

Marie & Atlantic rail way, which left Minneapolis yes terday, arrived here at 4 o'clock this afternoon, having as pass engers the Hon. W. D.
