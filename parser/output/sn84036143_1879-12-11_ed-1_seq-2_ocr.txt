ItVm HMto Itaiïà FISK BROS., - - Publishers. R. E. FISK, - - Editor. THURSDAY, DECGHBER 11, 1879. We cannot agree to swap epithets any more than we would consent to swap lies with the Independent. We affect no such accomplish ments. Our ambition leads in quite an op posite direction. The knack of calling names and uttering falsehoods beget no imi tators in reputable journalism. We have known lawyers, because of these things, to lose their footing in court rooms and editors their standing in communities. With these warnings fresh in mind, we had hoped to see some reformatory theories of the Independent carried out in practice. The present man agement seems to be but a second-hand edi tion of a former one, which met disaster and death in a twelvemonth. There we go again. We have lost William Tell, Bacon wrote Shakspeare, and now it seems that that little attention which Cain showed Abel was merely <( too much impetu osity." The editor of the Independent is of that class who have not risen to the level of seeing that truth is of the essence of all con troversy. His ambition is to "mouth a sen tence as curs mouth a bone." His assault upon ourselves is bad enough, but falsehood rises to unwonted dimensions when he comes to praise himself. His own avowment of his integrity needs to be certified to. His state ments as to himself, as to us, as to Judge Blake, in the presence of twenty-five thou sand witnesses who know better, are suffi ciently refuted. -ln We are sharpening our instruments. dependent. Commiserate us, sympathizing reader. The defensive instrument of our arch enemy is his ear. It cannot be enlarged in a moun tain country with any regard to the rights of other occupants of the public domain. His offensive instrument forbids him intensify ing its offensiveness. "Have you any strong cheese ?" asked a Teuton of the bar-keeper, as with his feet on the table he tested a sav ory piece of Limburger with his olfactories. "No," said Gambrinus, "take down your feet and just give that cheese a chance." Our Bourbon neighbor declares he is ready to forget our sins and remember only our vir tues. If the conditions were the same we should not hesitate to avow as much. What troubles most people is to discover where, in the Independent '» case, ain leaves off and virtue begins. The Herald asks only half a chance to find out some virtue in that quarter to show to what measureless extent, on occasion, is carried our sublime teach ings of Christian charity. The Duke of Cleveland has lately evicted from their homes on his Devonshire estates in England about one hundred and sixty families. They and their ancestors have oc cupied their houses since the Norman con quest. Successive dukes have refused to re pair them until they have ^become rickety, and the present Duke has conceived his own method of reform. He ordered the families to leave and began burning the tenements. The poor people had no where to go, and were in great distress. Some gentlemen in the neighborhood remonstrated, but ail they could get from the Duke was permission that the evicted might have a month or two of grace to find other shelter. The Herald says it will shortly print an edition of 20,009. Typographical error; should have been 200,009. — Miner. Well, the Miner'* figures are not so much out of the way as might at first appear. A single order covers 5,099 copies; another, 1,000; another, 600; and many others of 50 and 25, not to speak of scores of less impor tance. Should the demand for the Holiday Herald continue ia equal ratio to January 1st, our Butte contemporary will not so much have exceeded the mark. Of one thing it may be serenely assured, that the New Year's Number will be limited in its edition only by the publishers' ability to furnish the stock on which to print it Tbe kMb|M Revolt. London, December t.—A correspondent writes that the Kashgar revolt has ended by the final and complete defeat of Hakim Kahn of Tura, with a loss of one thousand killed. Hakim Kahn besieged Tachkourgan with five thousand men, the Chinese garrison number ing only 2,000, but all of Hakim Kaün's force deserted him, leaving him with only 1,600 Sarts. Hakim Kahn retired with these into the country of Kirghiz, who had desert ed his command, which he ravaged and then started for Russian territory laden with booty. The Chinese from Tachkourgan over took Hakim Kahn on the 21st. Traue la England. London, December 9.—The mill and fac tory owners at Arbroath, Scotland, have agreed to restore the wages ruling last Jan uary. The flax spinning works in Perthshire and Fifeshire, Scotland, concede an advance of five per cent, in wages. The Manchester Guardian , in its trade re port, says : There was a strong market on Monday, and prices farther advanced, but the most striking feature is the disparity be tween tbe views of buyers and sellers, and a consequent diminishing in the volume of transactions. a if his cio that at WORTH CONSIDERATION. It is noticed that several cities in Europe are trying the experiment of furnishing their own supply of gas. It is strange that such an experiment has not been tried before There seems no good reason offered for mak ing light and heat follow a different rule from that which is applied to water. There is scarce a city of pretension in the world that has not supplied itself with water at great cost, but at great saving in many shapes. It is for the general welfare that every one should have plenty of pure water. Why is it not for the public good that light and heat should be supplied in the same way ? The cost of water supply is paid by a special water rate, which is lighter on the richest than they could furnish it for themselves, while the poor are furnished free. We be lieve the same thing could be done in other articles as well as water. We suspect the present move originates in the fear of gas makers that their business will soon be at an end by the introduction of some other method of illumination, such as Edison's discoveries threaten. It may be wise not to hasten the adoption of the present methods on any gen eral or expensive scale. But the principle of making the supply as general as water is worth applying. So, too, in the matter of heating not only public but private houses by steam seems evidently worthy of adoption. It cannot be considered a doubtful experiment, for it has been tried on a large scale and with complete success. Private houses could be warmed at much less cost than the proprie tors have to pay. School houses and other public buildings could be warmed at less cost to the public, while the saving would more than suffice to warm the poor for nothing. The introduction of the general use of steam would prevent much of the present losses by fire, probably to as great extent as has been effected by having an abundant head of water always ready. Kitchen fires might still be needed for cooking purposes, but if no other need of fires existed we think some way would soon be found to dispense even with this need. Public ovens for cooking would soon come in vogue and more safe, convenient and economical. If electricity be made the means of illumi nation and fires for heating and cooking be banished from all houses, with the security that could well be given to the few localities where fires were used, it is easy to see that dangers and losses by fires, now so enormous, might be reduced three-fourths, and the prob ability is that this saving, with the consequent saving in the amounts paid for insurance, would pay a large share of the entire cost of fuel and lights to the entire community. It would cost no more, or but little more, to lay pipes for gas and steam at the same time that water pipes were laid. An arrangement so convenient and econ omical in every way cannot long fail of adop tion and would be a boon of inestimable value. Of course these considerations only apply to cities and large towns, but there misery, suffering and danger are greatest, and help would come where most needed. THE ETE COMMISSION. Either the Commission treating with the Utes is having a stormy and dangerous con ference or some sensational writer is trying his arts upon a bewildered public. The latest story treats us to a scene decidedly tragic in outline—six white men with drawn pistols confronting twenty-five wild savages with brandished knives. Here we are roused to expectancy of a tragedy, the pipe o£ peace spurned for the drawn dagger, and just as the spring is to be made for each others' throats, and we fancy we catch the sound of the pis tol's click, the whole thing is indefinitely postponed. We can't help suspecting that the true story of the Commission's progress is being dressed up by somebody for effect. The symbolic scales of peace and war are kept vibrating so regularly that the thing is hardly natural Ouray is one day represent ed as a true out-and-out friend of the whites and the next day he appears as bad as any of the rest. If the latest scene is correctly reported we fancy Commissioners are half inclined to agree to an adjournment to Washington or to resign in favor of some Congressional com mittee. As life insurance business has been drooping for a few years past, it strikes us that some enterprising agent would find a good field at Los Pinos just now. When this dramatic correspondent invites us to witness a grim tragedy next time, he need not be sur prised at some manifestations of disapproval, if he lets the curtain down at the critical turn of the play, and coolly invites us to come to his next exhibition. All that we know certainly is that the Com mission has not yet finished its labors. What the results will be we can only surmise from oar familiarity with Indian nature. We do not believe the guilty Utes will be peacefully sur rendered to be hung. War will be the issue. At tbe Capital. Washington, December 9. — Wm. E. Chandler has returned to Washington with his eldest son, who has been seriously ill in Salt Lake pity for some time past. ■n-M im I mm Papal Policy In Belgium. Rome, December 9.—Cardinal Nina, Papal Secretary of State, writes to the Papal Nun cio at Brussels that the Holy See has used all efforts in the past to avoid a conflict, and that further overtures are inconsistent with the dignity of the Holy See. Cardinal Nina in structs the Papal Nuncio to return to Rome at once if the Belgian government recalls its Ambassador to the Vatican. is It OUR TRUNK MAIL ROUTE. Petition Asking the Present Service to be Expedited. A petition has been for some days in cir culation here praying the Postmaster General for a betterment of the mail service between Franklin and fielena. The document sub scribed to by every class and condition of our people, is now about ready to go forward to Washington, and a few remarks in explana tion of' the object sought to be attained is not here out ot place. With the Utah & Northern railroad now completed and in operation to tbe southern boundary of the Territory, the mail service confers relatively no more benefits than when, two years ago, stages in place of the iron horse performed it nearly two hundred miles further south. In other words, the service over this route is tbe same to-day as when first transferred from Corinne, on the Central Pacific railroad, to Franklin, on the Utah & Northern at the time the terminus of the road rested at that place. The Utah & Northern has since made a stride spanning half of the distance, and is now separated from Central Montana by less than two hundred miles. The sched ules of service, remaining unchanged, be tween .Franklyn and Helena, are seventy two hours for summer and 120 hours for win ter. Our people unanimously ask that this service be now expedited by something less than one-half—or, in exact words, re duced from 120 hours in winter to 75, and from 72 hours in summer to 48. The request is most reasonable and we believe will be promptly granted by the Department. It is premised that the Post-office authori ties are conversant with the fact that tbe route named eseentially supplies tbe entire people of Montana, including the various In dian agencies, and also the military posts, even to Fort Assinniboine, on our extreme northern frontier. Montana, within tbe past year, has increased thousands in population Settlements have pushed out into many be fore uninhabited places. Cattle ranges and sheep pastures have been occupied where but a short time ago herds of buffalo fed unmo lested save by the Indian and sportsman. Our agricultural acreage has expanded and tillers of the soil are found cultivating farms in every valley of a grand domain measuring nearly 145,000 square miles. Our mining in dustry has made vast strides, and lodes of gold and silver and of the baser metals are being worked and developed as in no year before. Banking, merchandising, and all other business pursuits have kept pace with the growth of the Territory and are attract ing wide attention by the magnitude of their operations. The liberal policy adopted by the Depart ment, under the present administration, to ward the Territories will probably not bo al tered. It is liable, rather, to be still more generous than heretofore. Postmaster-Gen'l Key himself has within the past year jour neyed westward, extending his trip even to the Pacific coast. His tour was undoubtedly of great benefit in enlarging his ideas of the vastnes8 of the country and of the teeming, busy communities building up new common wealths. One Cabinet minister was booked for a visit to Montana the past summer, but he was called back to Washington before getting so far from the Capital. We should have been rejoiced had not only the Secre tary of the Interior have come, but the Post master-General also. We may possibly have the honor of visits from these and, we hope, other high officials another year. Our people would especially rejoice to welcome the ap pearance of the Head of the Post-office De partment. His administration of important governmental trusts has been exceptionally able and liberal, and no portion of the peo pie are quicker to understand and appreciate the good services he has rendered to the Ter ritories than Montana. He is the Key that has unlocked many a mountain fastness and opened to commnnication countless remote settlements pioneering the way of civiliza tion. The enlightened policy inaugurated by this Cabinet minister, we have reason to be lieve, will be pursued to the close of his term of office, and should the American people— as not unlikely they may—call upon him to serve them in still higher capacities, he will find nowhere warmer friends or stouter champions than those of the West who have come to. know his worth, the liberality of his policies, and the breadth of his statesman ship. POLYGAMY. President Hayes* Denunciation of "Twin Belle.** tbe (From tbe Message.] The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influen tial citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy, demands the attention of every department of the govern ment. This Territory has & population suffi cient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interest of the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change, will, however, never be approved by the country, while the citizens of Utah, in very considerable number, uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of the offense was enacted with great unanimity by Con gress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among tbe citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the Constitutional guarantee of religious free* dom. This objection is now removed. The Supreme Court of tbe United States has de cided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding as a rule of action on all who reside within the Territo ries. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcements. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should be amended, and, in aid of tbe pur pose in view, I recommend that more compre hensive and more searching methods for pre venting, as well as punishing, this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the United States, may be with held or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject. FINANCE. Interesting: Points in tbe President's Message. President Hayes in his Message says : The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the Government, di rectly affecting tbe business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on tbe successful execution of tbe Resumption Act. At the time fixed and in tbe manner contem plated by law the United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first of January last they have been promptly re deemed on presentation and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small and the volun tary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchang ed for United States notes and the amount of United States notes redeemed, is about $40, 000,000. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a great revival of busi ness. With currency equivalent in value to tbe money ot tbe commercial world, we are enabled iu enter upon an equal competition wub olber nations m trade and production. Tbe increasing foreign demand lor our manufactures and agricultural products bas caused a large balance of trade in our favor, wbicb bas been paid in gold from tbe first ot July last to November loth, to tbe amount ot about $59,000,000. Since tbe resumption of specie payments there bas been a marked and gratifying improvement of tbe public ci edit. Tbe bonds of tbe Government, bear ing only four per cent, interest, at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of tbe national debt wbicb was redeemable under tbe present laws. Tbe amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. Tne pendency of a proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe, to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in tbe recognized money of tbe world, leads me to recommend that Con gress refrain from new legislation on tbe gen eral subject. The great revival of trade, in ternal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further ex perimental measures with tbe coinage. 1 would, however, sirongly urge upon CoDgress tbe importance of authorizing tbe Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal rates. The market value of the silyer dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously im practicable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced in circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value and thus defeat the de sired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, and which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. The retirement from circulation of Uni td States notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable cur rency which 6hould be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm con viction that the issue of legal lender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the government, except in extreme urgency, is without warrant in the constitu tion and a violation of sound financial princi ples. The issue of United States notes dur ing the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender, between private individuals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circu lation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accom plishment of this purpose, was not con templated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period, con sistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitution has been to avoid tbe creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity, in the time of war debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that tbe ex* i8ting laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the pub 1 ? — j.Ll .!iL.^ « ISmSAaJ ma«Sa/I I-*/« MAinlniM lie debt within a limited period, be maintain ed. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Corgress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to tbe consumer and which will add several mil lions of dollars annually to the Treasury.
