NOTES OF PAST AND CURRENT EVENTS. By T, L. POWER. 4. * i ■ OUTING NOTES—Oonoluded. A visit to the home of Dr John Y. Wurrv and his interesting family, at Kip ^ ... ' ley, was specially enjova 1 «• ' der their hospitable roof that we re oup«rated in 1895, after the good people j of Mississippi had called us from a sick bed to a position of high honor in the State. Dr. Murry is one of the most dis tinguished and influential citizens of the county, and although now in advanced years, he walks as fast and steps as high as most men of 30. He was Sheriff of the county. Representative in the Legis laturc and Grand Master of Masons for two terms in succession—a rare honor in that body. He still practices mod.cine, keeps a drug store and is always active in every movement for the good of the community. His youngest son, Dr. C. M. Murry, is one of the best phvsi eians in the State, and has his full share of the practice in Riplcv and vicinity. Just now he is specially'busy, for there has been much typhoid fere? there this faH-and some deaths. Hon. John Y. Murry, Jr., the efficient _, Ä , tj . r*e and popular Secretary of our at. e Sen ate, practices law and conducts the Rip ley branch of the Tishomingo Savings In stitution. The good Lord is prospering him, as he deserves, in many ways. Dr. E. M. Alexander, another good friend, we were specially glad to meet. He is one of the best beloved citizens of Ripley. Ripley is the home of Hon. Thomas Spight, Representative in Congress for the Second District. He is a great force in that section; is always in demand, at Confederate reunions, educational a id church occasions. He Î3 a member of the Baptist Church. We called, of course, on our good friend, Jon Owen, editor of the Southern Sentirel and one of Tippah's Representatives in the Legislature. He lias a well-cquipp d office and a fine subscription list. He has just recovered from a protracted siege of typhoid fever. Ripley .was the home of Hon. Charles M. Thurmond, recently deceased, family has been much afflicted of late, but the devoted widow and mother ac cepts it all us- the dealing of One who doetli all things «<1.1. We made our second^yisit to Ripley's public school, conducted by Prof. John Newhardt and three capable assis* ants. The attendance is not hug-, and the equipment might be improved. Ripley should be a separate district, with an up-to-date building, and a nine-months' term. This would cost, but it would pay. We cannot do too much for our children; and in thus helping them we help ourselves. To Sheriff Sam Nelms and other coun ty officials we aro indebted for appreci ated courtesies. The He lias that kiml of j progressive spirit that is infectious. TIu Gazctte is a credit to M ssissippi journa' To him and to Mr. Roheit Hendcr son, .Tr., Sam Owen and many others, we indebted for courtesies during our very hurried visit. New Albany is a junctional point—on the Kansas City, Memphis & B rmi g liam, 26 miles from Tupelo and 34 miles from Holly Springs, crossing there should have a It is eighteen miles from Ripley to New Albany, on the Gulf & Chicago railroad. This road runs from Middleton, Tenn., on the Southern road, to Pontotoc, a dis tance of 624 miles. It is narr w gauge, and doing good business, and out of d.-bt. It was built by Col. W. C. Falkner, and is now owned and managed by Hon. John W. T. Falkner, Senator for Lafjyette. Some of these days it will extend in air line to Hattiesburg, connecting . here with the Gulf & Ship Island road. New Albany. keeps forging uhead. New buildings are the order of Hie dry in that progressive town. The matter of a new sehoo: build ing was being dismissal, and New A'bmy will not be true to its record if the neces sary bonds are not voted. Editor Bla' es lee is a great force in New Albany and in all that section. an ism. are , The two roads un on pas senger depot. It would be nice. Tupelo has a union depot, and the roads and the traveling public are proud of it. Holly Springs, reached at 8 o'clock Satuiday Taking advantage of a delayed train, we drove to the square and were glad to note some evidences of prosp r ity, in the way of new bui dings, and had the pleasure of meeting Georg? My is, Circuit Clerk, Pythian Grand Chancellor Blumenthal. Rev. Dr. Raymond, pres'dent of the Presbyterian,Female College our dear friend, Mrs. Dr. Butler, and others Many of Mississippi's greatest men lived in Holly Springs—distinguished in civil and military life. The city wa< spe ciajly seouraged by the yellow fever of 18i8, when the city opened wide her gates to plague-stricken Grenada teen hundred and forty of her people were prostrated by the disease, the total deaths being 304, or 71 66 per cent of the white population. The «baths include,1 Col. Harvey W. Walter and his noble b,-yg, Frank and Jimmie, Kinl-ch and Howard Fa'coner, Col. W. J. L. Holland, Col. E. W. Upshaw and one or more in nearly every home in the citv. Col Ivin loch Falconer left his office as Secretary of State never to return.

The university j dynamo will provide the current for the town, whose good people can dispense with oils and matches. The university has an abundance of pure water and per feet sewerage system. The School of Electric Engineering, recently established, will require a considerable plant. Prof, Douglas Anderson, late of Tulane. is in charge. _ The Library building, with its 23,000 volumes, is in fine shape. Mrs. Lizzie M. Hunt, of Ripley, is libiarmn. charge in July last, and has re-arranged, classified and catalogued all the books, Chancellor lull ton was very compliment ary of her management, W thp improvement« mentioned, and man y repairstliat have been made, the university will be m fine shape for better wor . k - But thel ? ? re ° ther and needs-a woman s building, a gymnasium anda m "" beT <>f coUagcs for marncd H U dents. There are thirty-five young ladies „ t the university ' and there would ^ rmp hundred if / woman's building provided. Chancellor Fulton related many interesting instances of how young men came to the university after they wore married and pursue the course to graduation, their wives helping in various * T , , ways. In one of the university classes there is now a young man pursuing his studies on money earned by his beautiful young wife, who has a position, on a small salary, in one of the schools that we visited. When he shall enter upon a lu crative law practice, and both are estab lished in a comfortable home, they can think it all over, and enjoy it the more because of the separation and sacrifice now experienced. On Saturday night the Phi Sigma had competitive speech-making and selected tivo commencement orators, the topic dis cussed being "Resolved, that the progress of civilization is due more to physical sci ence than to politics, and Drummond were voted the best speakers. The orators were honored by the presence of the young ladies of the Woman's College, who were in great force, in their becoming costumes, accompanied by President Malone and several of the teachers. She took were Messrs. Russell The present university enrollment is 240. Fifty or sixty more will enter after the holidays. On the 3d of March, 1901, Chancellor Fulton will complete his thirtieth year as n teacher in the University of Mississippi. He entered as a student in 1860, grad uated as first honor man in the class of 1809, some of his classmates being F. A. Critz, R. H. Thompson, W. Calvin Wells, R. N. Miller. since 1892, succeeding Chancellor Mayes. He is emphatically "the right man in the right place." Oxford has much improved since a for mer visit, especially in the residence por tion. One of the largest and handsomest residences recently erected is that of Hon. J. W. T. Falkner. Through the courtesy of Judge B. T. Kimbrough w'e were able to see all of Oxford. Ha poinetd out the homes of L. Q. C. Lamar, Jacob Thomp son, James M. Howry, II. A. Barr, Judge R. A. Hill and others who have passed away. Oxford has now the blessing of pure water, and will soon have a sewerage system. All the Protestant denominations have nice churches, and the public schools are among the best in the State. The Globe and Eagle continue to prosper. flic Masonic grand bodies will hold llieir annual meeting in Oxford during j the fourth week in February. This will add about four hundred to the popula tion, hut they will be amply provided for. There need be no anxiety on that score, And this concludes our outing, many things being omitted for want of space, He has been chancellor Colore! J. M. Stlgler. A comrade and admirer of this gal lant Confederate, thus writes: In your department of interesting and important Mississippi .natters and histori cal facts, for which I compliment you, that occurred before, during and since the War of Secession, is a brief mention of the life and death of Col. J. M. Stiglir at bis home in Lexington. Major Stigler commanded a battalion of sharpshooters in Featherston's brigade, LoviDg's division, Johnston's army, was a brave, gallant and trusted officer, and skillfully led his little command in the numerous engagements in which it partici pated. In the last engagement that John ston's army had, at Bentonville, N. C., the major, a young lieutenant, and one or two soldiers, were wounded. The major struck on the cheek, but he received prompt surgical attention and the wound healed. He was the last man wounded in the last battle, in the last of the fight. A superb soldier, a splendid citizen, has joined the great majority. Requiescat in pace. Wh He tlio Old Capitol Was First Occupied A correspondent writes: Will Colonel Power please state when the present State capitol was built and first occupied? On February 26, 1833, the sum of $95, 000 was appropriated toward the tion of a statehouse. erec The final report of the commissioner of public build ings was made January 16, 1840_the expenditures were about 8100 , 000 . The capitol was first used by the leg islature in January, 1839. Nutt, in his message to that session, said: The capitol, although not finished, is so far advanced as to afford accommodation to the legislature and the various public officers. The building has progressed slowly the past year, and it is believed the expenditures have been unusually ex travagant. A rigid scrutiny into all the contracts and aceoo its of the officers charged with the erec ion of the statehouse rnd penitentiary is necessary. The rooms of the old statehouse were, by resolution, authorized to be us -d for various purposes after the legislatu took possession of the new capitol, l he old statehouse was a brick build* rag on the corner where the Harding Gov. Me very that re building now stands. It was used for many years as the Mississippian office. Errors Corrected —Omission» Supplied. Port Gibson, Nov. 28, 1000. Dear Col. Power—I have read your roster of field officers of regiments of Mississippi volunteers up to and including the Twenty first regiment, as published in the Green wood Commonwealth I notice one or two errors which, in compliance with your re quest, I will correct, as follows: ! You omit from the Twelfth regiment j Mojor W. H. Lily (killed in railroad ac j cident at Chunkey river, Miss., tn 1862.) ; In the Sixteenth regiment E. T. Connerly should read Edward T.

This battalion was completed to a regi ment and known as the Forty-eighth Mississippi, with Joseph M. Jayne as colonel; T. B. Manlove, lieutenant-colonel, and L. C. Lee as major. Major Lee was disabled before Richmond, and never re turned to the regiment, nor was the vacancy ever filled, and we never knew our major except for a few months.

I have that of the battalion and regiment—Second battalion and Forty eighth regiment at your service. Yours, F. H. Foote. The State Flower. The vote on State flower has not vet been tabulated. The result cannot be definitely announced before next week. The indications are that the Magnolia is in the lead; the Cotton Bloom, Chrys anthemum, Cape Jasmine and others being favorites. Here is the report of the resut of A. and M. College, as wired by President J. C. Hardy: 305; Cotton Bloom, 95, wins. (colored), gave Cotton Blossom 211; Magnolia., 37. Greenville gave the Cotton Plant and Blossom, 485; Mag nolia, 290. nolia, 385; Cape Jasmine, 30. "Magnolia, Sentiment Alcorn A. and M.

They balloted, and unani mously voted for William J. Bryan for president, and Adlai E. .Stevenson for vice-president, and will repeat the ballot when they meet in January. All nine electors were present—James J. McCool, T. U. Sisson, J. P. Landrum, Jr., W. J. East, J. T. Lowe, E. D. Stone, A. Witherspoon, Edward Mayes. Mr. Garrard Harris, of Jackson, was elected to carry the vote to Washington. The Oldest Mississippi Legislator. In a recent issue we named several living members of the legislatures of 1844 and 1840. who outranks them—the venerable Wyatt J. Draughn.of Hattiesburg, who represented Perry county at the regular session in January, 1840. He is 88 yeard of age, and has been living in Perry county eighty-tw o yea rs. Indications are that Mississippi will be largely and ably represented at the meeting of the Southern Educational Association in Richmond on the 27th inst. Chancellor Robert Fulton of the University of Mississippi is president. One fare for round trip from all points. | h rorn Jackson the round trip rate is $25.50. The Evening Star claims that "Me- , ridlan is the best town in the State; that there is nearly twice as much busi ness, wholesale and retail, done there as in any two cities of the State, two houses enjoying a trade that will total something like$450,000." There is no prominent citizen of Mis sissippi whose name is more uniformly misspelled than that of Judge Newnan Cayce of Columbus. It is usually print ed Newman and Noonan. Newnan is correct. The population of four Mississippi cities, ns telegraphed the Jackson News by Census Director Merriam, is as fol lows: Vicksburg, 14,834; Meridian, 14, 050: Jackson, 7,816; Greenville, 7,642. Natchez is to have an electric street railway, built by local capitalists. Somt of the local capitalists of Jackson will never cease to regret that they did not build the street railway in that city. It is the most money-making franchise in Mississippi. Among the Thanksgiving offerings to the N.itchez Protestant Orphan Asy lum is one that we are specially pleased to note—$5 from the students (colored) of Alcorn A. and M. College. They make an annual contribution to the asylum. Hon. W. L. Trowbridge was re-elected mayor of Vicksburg. The Hill City is progressive, and Trowbridge is built that way.
