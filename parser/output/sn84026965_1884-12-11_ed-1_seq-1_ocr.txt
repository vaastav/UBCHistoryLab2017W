Sensible Views and Recommendations Ex? pressed Most Politely. The more important parts of President Arthur's Annual Message, which was presented to Congress yesterday, are as follows: Since the close of your last session the American people, in the exercise of their highest right of suffrage, have chosen their Chief Magistrate for the four years ensuing. When it is remembered that, at do period in the country's history has the long political contest which custom? arily precedes the day of the national election jeen waged with greater fervor and intensity, it is a subject of general congratulation that, after the controversy at the pol la was over, and while the slight preponderance by which the issue bad been determined was as yet unascertained, the public peace puffered no disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result. Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the tem? per of the American citizen, his love of order and his loyalty to law. Nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institutions. Eight years have pussed since a con? troversy concerning the result of a na? tional election sharply called the attention of the Congress to the necessity of pro? viding more precise and definite regula? tions for counting the electoral vote. It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the Presidency shall again dis? tract the country, and I am persuaded that by the people at large any of the measures of relief thuo proposed would be preferred to continued inaction. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations with all foreign powers continue to be amicable. With France the traditional cordial relationship continued. The colossal statue of Liberty enlightening the world, the generousg.."t of the people of France, is expected to reach New York in May next. I suggest that Congressional action be taken in recognition of the spirit which has prompted this gift and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal upon which it is to be placed. THE HAWAIIAN TREATY. The Government of Hawaii has indi? cated its willingness to continue for seven years the provisions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of States, should, in my judgment, be favored. Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes to our own some of the best elements of citizenship, continue to be cordial. THE DUTY ON WORKS OF ART, Much anxiety has lately been display? ed by various European Governments, and especially by the Government of Italy, for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art. It is well to consider whether the present discrimiuation in favor of the productions of American artists abroad is not likely to result, as they themselves seem very generally to believe it may, in the practical exclusion of our painters and sculptors from the rich fields for observation, study and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed. 

MEXICO. During the past year the increasing good will between our own Government and that of Mexico has been variously manifested. The treaty of commercial reciprocity, concluded January 20, 1883, has been ratified, and awaits the necessa? ry tariff legislation of Congress to become effective. This legislation, will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention. A full treaty of commerce, navigation and consular rights is much to be desired, and such a treaty, I have reason to be? lieve, the Mexican Government stands ready to conclude. THE NICARAGUA CANAL. With the Republic of Nicaragua a trea? ty has been concluded which authorizes the construction by the United States of a canal, railway and telegraph line across the Nicarauguan territory. By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the River San Juan, as well as Lake Nicaragua, an inland sea forty miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enter? prise. This leaves for actual canal con? struction seventeen miles on the Pacific side and thirty-six miles on the Atlantic. To the United States, whose rich territory on tbe Pacific is, for the ordinary purpo? ses of commerce, practically cut off from communication by water with the Atlan? tic ports, the political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated. It is believed that when tbe treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions will com? mand universal approval at home and abroad. CURAN INSURGENTS. This Government has more than once been called upon of late to take action in fulfillment of its international obliga? tions toward Spain. Agitation in the Island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish Crown having been fomented by persons abusing the sacred rights of hospitality which our territory afiords, tbe officers of this Government have been instructed to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and at other points near tbe Cuban coast. In the only instance where these precau? tionary measures were successfully eluded tbe offenders when found in our territory were subsequently tried and convicted. THE SPANISH TREATY. The growing need of close relationship of intercourse and traffic between the Spanish Antilles and their natural mar? ket in the United States led to tbe adop? tion, in January last of a commercial agreement looking to that end. This agreement has since been superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehen? sive convention which I shall submit to tbe Senate for approval. It has been tbe aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of produc? tions carried under tbe lag of either country, as to make the intercourse between Cuba and Porto Rico and our? selves scarcely less intimate than tbe commercial movement between our domestic ports, and to insure a removal of the burdens on shipping in the Span? ish Indies, of which iu tbe past our ship owners and ship masters have so often had cause to complain. THE NEUTRALITY LAWS. I recommend that the scope of tbe neutrality laws of tbe United States be so enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and aimed against tbe peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the shipment of explosives, though tbe enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to international obligations, but simply for the protection of passenger travel. All tbeBe statutes were intended to meet special emergencies that bad already arisen. Other emergencies have arisen since, and modern ingenuity supplies means for tbe organization of hostilities without open resort to armed vessels or to filibustering parties. I see no reason wby the preparations in tbis country for the commission of criminal acts, such as are here under consideration, should not be alike punishable whether such acts are intended to be committed in our own country or in a foreign country with which we are at peace. The prompt and thorough treatment of this question is one which intimately concerns the na? tional honor. THE CONSULAR SERVICE. The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain changes and reductions which have been productive of embarrass? ment. Tbe population and commercial activity of our country are steadily on the increase and are giving rise to new, varying and often delicate relationships with other countries. Our foreign estab? lishment now embraces nearly double tbe area of operations that it occupied twenty years ago. The confinement of such a service within tbe limits of ex? penditure then established is not, it seems to me, in accordance with true economy. A community of sixty millions of people should be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign nations. A project f")r the reorganization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction is now before you. If tbe limits of a short session will not allow of its full consid? eration, I trust that you will not fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of tbe service. THE 

REVENUES. The ordinary revenues for tbe fiscal year ending June 30, 1884, were $348, 519,869.92. The public expenditures during tbe same period were $290,916,473. Leaving a surplus of ?57,603,396 as com? pared with the preceding fiscal year. There was a net decrease of over $21, 000,000 in the amornt of expenditures. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the year previous by about $54,000,000. The falling off in revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of this deficienc;- ?nd about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the dimin? ished receipts from internal taxation. The secretary estimates tbe total receipts for the fiscal year which will end June 30,1885, at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures at $290,620,201.16, in which sum are included the interest on the debt and the amou ' payable to the sinking fund. This wt id leave a sur? plus for tbe entire year of about $39,000, 000. EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. The value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during tbe year ending June 30, 1884, was as fol? lows: Domestic merchandise, $724,964, 852; foreign merchandise, $15,548,757. Total merchandise, $740,513,609; specie, $67,133,383. Total exports of merchan? dise and specie, $807,646,992. The cot? ton and cotton manufactures included in this statement were valued at $208,900, 415; the breadstufls at $162,544,715; the provisions at $114,416,547, and the mineral oils at $47,103,248. During the same period the imports were as follows: Merchandise, $667,697,693; gold and silver, $37,426,262. Total, $705,123,955. THE SILVER COINAGE. I concur with tbe secretary of the treasury in recommending tbe immedi? ate suspension of the coinage of silver dollars, and of tbe issuance of silver certificates. The number now outstand? ing is nearly one hundred and eighty-five million whereof but little more than forty million, or less than 22 per cent., are in actual circulation. The secretary asserts his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver cer? tificates be suspended, silver is likely, at no distant day, to become our sole metal? lic standard. The commercial disturb? ance and tbe impairment of national credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated. I hope that the secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal from circulation of tbe one dollar and two dollar notes will receive your approval. It is likely that a con? siderable portion of tbe silver now encumbering the vaults of the treasury might thus find its way into the currency. INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES. In my annual message of 1882 I re? commended the abolition of all excise taxes except those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed. Iu case those taxes shall be abolished tbe revenues that will still re? main to the Government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be ad? visable when the results of recent reve? nue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters those re? ductions can be most judiciously affected. FOREIGN TRADE. One of tbe gravest of the problems which appeal to tbe wisdom of Congress for solution is tbe ascertainment of tbe most effective means for increasing our foreign trade, and thus relieving the depression under which our industries are now languishing. The secretary of the treasury advises that the duty of investigating tbis subject be intrusied in the first instance to a competent com? mission. While fully recognizing tbe considerations tbat may be urged against this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion that, upon the whole, no other would be likely to effect speedier or better results. That portion of the secretary's report which concerns the condition of our shipping interests cannot fail to com? mand your attention. He emphatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in American steamships the Government shall, by liberal payments for mail trans? portation or otherwise, lend its active assistance to individual enterprise, and declares his belief that unless tbat course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must remain as it is to day?almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners. One phase of tbis subject is now especi? ally prominent in view of the repeal by the Act of June 26.1884, of all statutory provisions arbitrarily compelling Ameri? can vessels to carry the mails to and from the United States. As it is neces? sary to make provision to compensate the owners of such vessels for performing that service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subject will receive early consideration and will lead to the enact? ment of such measures for the revival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of Congress may devise. THE NATIONAL BANKS. As the 3 per cent, bonds still constitute tbe chief basis for the circulation of tbe national banks, the question how to avert the contraction of the curreucy caused by their retirement, is one of con-* stantly increasing importance. It seems to be generally conceded tbat the law governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security, and that upon their present bond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be grated with safety. I hope that the bill which passed the Senate at the last session, permitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of the deposited bonds, will commend itself to the ap? proval of the House of Representatives. 

RIVERS AND HARBORS. The funds with which the works for the improvement of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations of the act of August 2,1882. together with such few balances as were on hand from previous appropriations. Tbe balance in the treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883, was $10.021,649.55. The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 1884 was $1,319.634.62, and the amount drawn from the treasury during the fiscal year was $8,228,703. r4, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.63 in tue -reasury subject to requisition July 1,1884. FORTIFICATIONS. The secretary of war submits the report of the chief of engineers as to the practicability of protecting our im? portant cities on tbe seaboard by forti? fications and other defences able to repel modern methods of attack. The time has now come when such defences can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive, and when tbe possible result of delay in making such prepara? tions is seriously considered delay seems inexcusable. For tbe most important cities, those wbose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation, ade? quate defences inclusive of guns may be made by the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000, a sum which is less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contri? bution. &o appropriation of about one tenth of that amount is asked tor to begin the work, and I concur with the secretary of war in urging that it be granted. NEW WAR VESSELS. The recommendations of the naval advisory board approved by the depart? ment comprise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 loos, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gunboats, one light cruising gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armed ram and three torpedo boats. The general designs, all of which are calcula? ted to meet the existing wanis of the service, are now well advanced and the construction of the vessels can be under? taken as soon as you shall grant tbe necessary authority. THE NAVY. In this tbe last of tbe stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the Congress of tbe United States I cannot too strongly urge upon its atten? tion the duty of restoring our navy as rapidly as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it. As tbe long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed, it is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of wise economy, of a just regard for our future tranquility and of a true appreciation of tbe dignity and honor of the Republic. REDUCTION OF POSTAGE. I confidently repeat the recommenda? tion of my last annual message that the siugle rate postige upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wberever the pay? ment of two cents is now required by law. I approve the recommendation of the postmaster general that the unit of weight in tbe rating of first-class matter shouid be one ounce instead of one halt ounce as it now is. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The attorney-general renews the recom? mendation contained in his report of last year touching the fees of witnesses and jurors. He favors radical changes in tbe fee bill, the adoption of a system by which attorneys and marshals of tbe United States shall be compeusated solely by salaries, and the erection by the Government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offenders against tbe laws of the United States. THE EXTENSION OF OUR COMMERCE. In the course of this communication reference has more than once been made to the policy of this Government as regards the extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare tbe general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this diiection. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated. We are a people apt in mechanical pursuits, and fertile in invention. We cover a vast extent of territory, rich in agricul? tural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manu? factures. We have a system of produc? tive establishments more than sufficient to supply our own demands. The wages of labor are so great, and the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the preseut needs of the Government. These are the elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the con? dition of the working-man, our merchant mariue shall be raised from its enfeebled condition, and new markets provided for the sale beyond our borders of tbe mani? fold fruits of industrial enterprises. The problem is complex, and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or reform. The countries of the American Continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural marts of supply and demand. It is from them that we should obtain of whut we do not produce, or do not produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus pro? ductions of our fields, our mills and our workshops should flow under conditions that will equalize or favor them iu com? parison with foreign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end. First a series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between us and show an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of these treaties should be tbe free admission of such merchan? dise as this country does not produce, in return for the admission, free or under a favored scheme of duties, of our own products; the benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of the parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from the vessels so privileged of all tonnage, dues and national imposts, so that those vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and those of the other contracting parties, though without infringing on the re? served home-coasting trade; the removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries coming into the beuefits of the treaties and the avoid? ance of the technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered. Secondly, the establishment of tbe con? sular service of the United States on a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular feee, not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty nations, carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties. Thirdly the enactment of measures to favor the con? struction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the ilag of the United States. Fourthly, the establish? ment of an uniform currency basis for the countries of America, so that tbe ' coined products of mines may circulate on equal terms throughout the whole system of Commonwealths. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby tbe output of the bullion-pro? ducing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in conformity with the population, wealth and commercial needs of each. As many of the coun? tries furnish no bullion to the common stock, the surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the general remonitization of silver. To the accom? plishment of the ends so far as they can be attained by separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed, and the favor which this enlarged policy has thus far received warrants the belief tbat its operations -/ill ere long embrace all, or nearly all, the countries of tbis hemis? phere. It is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consider 1 ation should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff bur? dens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American States are fitted to produce, and thus enabling our? selves to obtain in return a better market for our supplies of food, of raw material and of the manufactures in which we excel. It seems to me that many of tbe embarrassing elements in tbe great national conflict between Protection and Free-trade may thus bo turned to good account; tbat the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax the people, that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome, that our shipping interests may be judi? ciously encouraged, tbe currency fixed on firm basis and above all such an unity of interests established among the States of the American system as will be of great and ever increasing advantage to them all. 

POLYGAMY. The report of tbe Utah commission will be read with interest. It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territory. I still believe tbat, if tbat abominable practice can be suppressed by law, it can only be by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that Con? gress assume absolute political control of the Territory of Utah, and provide for tbe appointment of commissioners with such governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put into their bands. THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW. The good results anticipated have been more than realized. The system has fully answered tbe expectations of its friends in securing competent and faith? ful public servants, and in protecting the appointing officers of tbe Government from tbe pressure of personal importuni? ty, and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candi? dates for public employment. The law has had the unqualified support of the President and of the heads of the several departments, and the members of the commission have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity. 

NATIONAL BANKRUPT LAW. In view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commercial com? munity for a national bankrupt law I hope that the differences of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enact? ment may not outlast the present session. THE CHOLERA. The pes:iience which for the past two years has been raging in the countries of tbe Ep.st, recently made its appearance in European ports with which we are in constant communication. The then secretary of tbe treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the President, issued certain regulations restrict? ing for a time the importation of rags and tbe admission of baggage of immi? grants and of travellers arriving from infected quarters. Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation of tbe present secretary, that Congress take action in the premises, and I also recom? mend the immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off tbe dreaded epidemic, and to mitigate its severity in cose it shall unhappily extend to our shores. U. S. 

GRANT. I recommend that, in recognition of the iminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late General of the United States and twice President of this nation, tbe Con? gress confer upon bim a suitable pension. CONCLUSION. As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from tbe public service, I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with whom I have been brought into personal and official intercourse, my sincere apprecia? tion of their unfailing courtesy and of the harmonious co-operation with the Executive in so many measures calculat? ed to promote the best interests of the nation. To my fellow-citizens generally I acknowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accord? ed me in my administration of the Exec? utive department of this Government. Docs Shelter Pay I With the beginning of cold weather, the necessity of giving the stock ample protection becomes apparent. Wise far? mers not only agree to this, but experi? ments have shown the wisdom of giving the stock warm shelter during Winter. Toobtain the comparative effect produced by both shelter and exposure, tbe Ohio Experiment Station separated 10 hogs into two lots each, giving one lot the best of shelter while the other lot was given but ordinary shelter. This experiment was continued from Dec. 7, 1882, to March 29,1883. The pigs were fed dike ?corn in the ear twice daily, and plenty of pure water at all times. There was but a difference of two pounds in the amount of corn consumed by the two lots. 3,240 pounds of corn were fed to the pigs in the closed pens, which made an increase of 350 pounds in weight. 3,242 pounds of corn were fed to the piga in the open pen, which made an increase of 220 pounds. The sheltered animals required 9.' pounds of corn to make one pound of increase, while those in the open pen required 13 pounds. From fig? ures given by the Station, the pigs in the open pen during the coldest periods re? quired 17.6 pounds of corn to make one pound of increase, while those in the closed pen required only 7.5 pounds of corn to make a pound of meat. These figures are facts, and speak for themselves. We cannot afford to allow stock to stand shivering in cold barns all Winter. Plaster up the ruptures in the walls, replace broken panes of glass with whole ones, cover the cracks in the sides of tbe barn, shingle tbe roofs, nod prepare for Winter. It will pay every time. ? Well-executed ten-dollarcounterfeit notes upon the Cincinnati National Bank, of Cincinnati, 0., are in circula? tion.
