In the last six years the cotton mills of the boulh have increased in num ber from 1GI to 310, and in productions eighty-eight per cent. They have se cured new markets, and are now large ly exporting goods. When nearly $100,000,000 a year in excesjof the wants of the government are annually drawn from the people, is it liOt time for Congress to be devis ing some means of stopping the op pressive robbery? Is there not a de mand for revenue reform ? Ouk foreign exports for the year ending October 31 were $697,000,000, and our imports $655,840,000. The balance in our favor was $41,000,000, a falling off of $103,000,000, compared with the corresponding twelve months f the preceding year. In twelve Southern States during the three months ending December 1, there were incorporated 25 blast fur naces, 65 railroad companies, 131 wood working establishments, 18 electric companies, 73 foundries, mills and machine shops, 50 mining and smelt lug companies, and 36 flour mills, v It has been calculated that this Government of ours pays in pensions to ex-soldiers $7,000 per day. And not one of these pensioners was a rebel soldier. There is a suspicion gaining ground that the prediction that in cast the Democrats succeeded to power th Rebel debt would be paid aud Rebel soldiers pensioned,was not well based. The importance of natural gas in Pittsburgh is but seen in the fact that it reduces the consumption of coal at the rate of 400,000 bushels per day, oi over 100,000,000 bushels per year. This coal must find a market elsewhere. A great deal of it is being sent by rail to the Northwest, and thus comes in competition with the mines of the fioeking Valley. No man has the genius or brains to own $5,000,000. The mouey owns him He is the key to a safe. Yet thee meli go on accumulating. It is a sort of insanity.

I feel that I am bound by an implied contract to stay here aud endeavor t aid in securing deserved legislation for them. Although the Supreme Court will doubtless obey the party behest, and decide the Dow law to be valid, still the fact remains that it is unconstitu tional for three reasons : 1st, It priv lieges the traffic in beer and spirits licenses it, in other words.for a uniform consideration in money not measured by any standard of taxation. 2d, It is unconstitutional whether it be a tax (which can only be laid upon proper ty), or a license, which is expressly forbidden. 3d, It was passed by an unconstitutionally constituted and revolutionary legislature. When your protectionist friend talks about American workingmen being obliged to compete against the pauper labor of the old world if it were not for " protection," and points to the wretched condition of the En glish workingmen as the fruit of free trade, ask him why they don't go to Germany where all industries are ful ly "protected," and the beauties of " high protection " shine forth in all their glory. In Germany, the most highly protected country on earth, for tan hours' work a man receives 25 to 60 cents, for outdoor labor, and a wo man 15 to 30 cents ; seamstresses, 20 to 50 cents; machinists, 70 cents ; car penters, 70 cents to $1 ; masons, the ame.

Some idea of the value of water in Southern California may b gained from the opening of the Gage irriga ting canal, near Kiverside. Three years ago land sold above Riverside for $5 an acre. It was without water and was couuted valuable only for grazing. Mr. Gage made a contract with a large number of owners of land to furnish them abundant water at $100 per acre. Then lie dug an eleven mile canal, supplied with water partly from Santa Anna River, but mainly from artesian wells. Recently water was turned into the canal, and land which sold for $5 now sells readily at j3"0 an acre. Rutherford B Hayes is now the oulyiivmgex President, and Hauni bal Hainiin aud William A. Wheeler the only living ex Vice Presidents. Fremont and Blaine are the only iiv ing ex-Presidential candidates of ;re-u parties, and Pendleton, KnglisW and Logan the only living Vice Presiden tial candidates. The ranks of these prominent gentlemen have thinned greatly by the death within eighteen niciiilis of Grant, I-leCleliau H.ui cock, Tilden, Seymour and Arthur. A more noted group has hardly ever before passed off the stage of life so j nearly together. The Cincinnati Commercial Ga zette advises American workingmen to read a detailed statement of the un fortunate condition of the bricklayers in .London, and intimates that their more fortunate fellow-tradesmen in this country are indebted to the tat ill' for their better condition. Unfortun ately for the Commercial's argument, the trade of the bricklayer is not pro tected by the tariff even indirectly, aud the same is true of nearly every branch of well paid mechanics. The policy of protection to capital and free trade in labor which prevailed during the twenty-five years of Republican dour ination, has had the direct effect of bringing the mechanics of America in direct com petition with the pauper labor of Europe," and reduced the compensation of American labor in every branch, skilled and otherwise Stneca Advertiser. Labor Produces All and Pay All. The profits of the merchant upon his sales aie expected to cover all his ex penses and yield him a liberal per .-cut. upon bis investment besiaes. these txpemrs include rents, c'eik hire, cost of living, lights, fuel, freight and tuxes, iotbepionts wuien ate to cover these items of expense must be added those tLe merchant is com peiled to pay upon his puichases. which, to be briet, we will say are those ol manufacturers. These latter are the profits, as a rule, of corporate monopolies that are protected gainst the legitimate competition of the world in an average ratio' of at least forty per cent, upon the cost of production! Other pionis may be extortionate; these are based upon a principle of in justice. As a source of public revenue the system of protection is unjust in its operations to labor and the po')i, aud is as much a fraud in this respect as it is a piotector of industiy. In many instances protective duties are so high as to be prohibitory, thus not only robbing labor but restricting la bor and fostering monopoly. The profits of the jobber aud wholesale merchant, like those of the retail dealer must cover all expenses, etc , so that, all told, at least 75 per cent, is thus auded to the price of manufactured goods to consumers. This would cer tainly seem a sufficient margin of profits to lie between producing and consuming labor, but the alleged - friends ot industry'' are not yet sal istied, and so proceed to superadd a tariff tax of 40 per cent., thus briugitig up the price of protect ed manufactures to 110 per cent, upon the cost of pro ductiou, or rather upon the prices iiiut rule in the world's market. The American consumer, for instance, as agaiust English- mauutactured goods, must pay tariff tax above what the fatter could be brought here free of duly auU sold for, including mauufac aims' profits and the cost of tiaus portation, at an average rate of 40 per cent. Tnis 40 per cent, is levied upon the wages of Americau labor, pockt ted by niauulacturiUK monopolists, unu constitutes wtiat is oslentaUously styled ''protection to American in dustiy " The question we wish to ask it! this article is how it can be hoped that labor can prosper in this country when it must pay as a consumer $2.20 for hul as a producer it only receives id. 00? or perhaps much less? Cap ital is the iulii:g tyrant in America It holds both ends of the string of n ade. it says to farmers and laborers 1 will give you so much," when it buys, aud "you must give me he much," when it sells. The farmers aud laborers yield aud do not prosper. wlule the piles ot capital grow higher aud higher.

The President is of the opinion that Congress should do something to re imburse the mauy poor colored men throughout the country who lost their savings in the Freedman's Ba.uk swindle. He thinks they believed that the faith of the Government was given to the bank, and upon that be lief they were induced to make their deposits. About one-third of the mon ey these poor men deposited was lost. The depositors are scattered all over the country, though a number of them reside in the District of Columbia. About one-third of the deposits were lost under the brilliant management of a sanctified set of Republicans, who held a hymnbook in one hand, while the other was up to the elbow in the bank's vault. The Mexican greasers don't like President Cleveland's message; the Canadians don't like it, and the mo nopolists denounce it because it op poses their schemes to tax the whole people to augment the wealth of the favored few but the general impres sion is that it is a plain, straightfor ward dot ument, discussing the tjues- waru tions em braced in it in a clear, coiu-ise a;j,i statesmanlike manner, and will forraer residents. j A Youncjstownt special dispatch to the Plain Dealer uuuouuues the death of Hon.

His great grandfather, Jona than K iwnnis, president of Princeton College, was undoubtedly the most profound logician tbis country has ever produced. The deceased gradua ted at Yule in 1S-4, read law with Juilge Bristol, of "New Haven, and was admitted to the bar ill 1S2A. He removed to Youngstown in 1832, but soon moved into Irumbull county, whero in addition to the practice of his profession, he edited the Trumbull Dtmocrnt. After the passage of the bankrupt law in 1S41 he was appointed by !! United Stales District Court Commissioner of Bankrupts for Trum buil County, and he.d the office until t lie law was repealed. In 1S-12 he was the Democratic noni ince for Representative to Congress from the old Nineteenth District to till the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Hon. Joshua R. Gid dings. In 1846 he started the Mahou- ing Ititicx at Cuntjeld, and in 1864 he became iho associate editor of the Youngstown Register.

The fa'sitv of the charge so often reit; rafed durU'2 the recent deprts slons of the price of silver, that the ttandnrd uollar wa- worth so much less than its real value, :s clearly shown it; the fad that new, as the market price of bullion rapidly approaches the standard value of the dollar, that its nower as currency is. aud has been. in no wise atlVxled by the fluctuations l'Ltlie bullion value or the sliver In the marRrts of the world. The silver dollar wil: purchase iu more goods tod i aud will pay no more indebted ness at lids tTiue, while silver is rap idly Hearing one dollar per ouoce,thau it would when the price was at its lowest ebb. If theie beany truth in the aiariniug statements so persist eutly made with regard to the real value of tiie silver dollar it certainly, under these wide vicissitudes, would have been most clearly manifested and proven. Rut as its value has not changed in the Ict, aud it has per formed its functions as perfectly under one eoii'ii'ioii is t?e other, the logical t o-u-iu must be 'that the charge tiiruic against it was false and ground less. The recent decline in the price of silver bullh.u, the movement which WbS inaugurated and abetted by its enemies and which was looked upon with alarm by many friends of the silver coinage, has in its result proven oue of the most beneficial things that ciu!(i have transpired ; it has proven bi-youd the ijuestion of a doubt the utter absurdity of the so called argu ment made in opposition to its use; a:id has vindicated, by an unanswera ble evidence, the abolute necessity tor its free coinage aud unlimited legal ouahhcations. There is no justice in issuing limited co'nage or currency which possesses limited powers currency, aud the Government should lake a higher position than to work iti tii.'- interests of a class, and should set. always, with the interests of th whole people constantly in view.

Too .ilucli Taxation. The Washington Critic says: I seems now to be a foregone conclusion that lha two great opposiug forces in Congress will lock horns on the tariff L-sue liii-i session. Roth bides are in earnest. Jir. Anderson, of Ohio, said yesterday, " This thing has gone on long cuouh. The tariff must be re ilitml. It is now a matter of necessi ty. This overtaxation is criminal We have uuw in round figures a bun drcd millions coming iu which we do not know what to do with. Is it right? 2so. What is tho remedy? There is but one i educe the revenue. How much ought it to be reduced? At lea-.l titii ty millions now, aud more in the future From what will I take it? Why, from ttie uccassitie-, of course.' "How about woo), Mr. Anderson? Would you favor a re.luotiou on wool, in which your Slate is so largely in terested?" Yes, sir, I certainly would I will :'avor anything that will relieve the people at large of this halter about their necks. 1 don't think such sen limeuts will make me more popular at home, but it is for the good of the country at large. We must all make some concessions, or nothing in the way ot t.irilf reform is possible. Here you see oue m.iu from a wool-growing State who is willing to concede some thing aud meet the members from Males with iron aud other industries half way. And it is only in such a spirit of conciliation that the great subject of tarifl reform can be well- handled aud judicious results produc ed." Rkv. Dr. Nkwman, of Washington, D.

Mr Hewitt received hearty congratulations upon Ills election to the Mayoralty, and expressions of re gret upon his retirement from Con gress. Those who had served in former Congresses with Mr. Cox gathered around him cordially, and those who did not know him sought introduc tions. Representative Sayers of Texas, who occupied, last session, the seat so long used by Mr. Cox, gracefully sur rendered It to its former occupant and took the one vacated by Mr. Pulitzer. Mr. Cox has already added to his record by introducing a bill to prevent Representatives from receiving two salaries at the same time. He thus manifests his intention to decline the Congressional salary which has ac crued since Mr. Pulitzer's resignation. Republican papers gleefully distorted a recent statement to make it appear that Mr. C'x had applied for aud was trying to get two salaries one as min ister to Constantinople, aud one as Congressman. As a matter of fart he inquired of the Comptroller of the Treasury as to the exact money due him under the law so that he could act intelligently couceruing it. Comp troller Durham told him he was enti tled to back pay since Mr. Pulitzar resigned, and this bill just introduced shows what Mr, Cox intended at the lime to do about it. While the President's message takes one all over Europe, to the Samcan Islands, Siberia, the Spanish Autelles to Mexico, over South America, and into Canada and Alaska, the five top ics which excite the strongest interest here are the tarifl, the currency, the labor question, civil sea vice aud Dis trict of Columbia atTairs. The tariff reformers are all pleased and some of them are enthusiastic. The protec tionists say the message is couserva five enough for them, the ultra silver men make complaints, as was expect ed, aud the Republicans criticise the document as a whole, aud frotu force of habit. Some of the more sluggish members of Congress predict that little can be done during tbe session beyond the passage of the Appropriation bills. OtheTs equally wise say there is more chance for work during a short than a long session, and they expect to be very active between now aud the fourth of March. In fact, there is lit tie temptation to demagogueism and talking for votes now, aud there is no reason why this Congress should not do more in January aud February than in all the previous months of its life. The members are all either elect ed or defeated for the Fiftieth Con gress, and mere partisan maneuvers will not affect them. Then by the committee work having been done last session, bills are ready for action, and legislation is in excellent position to be pushed to completion. Congressman Andersou, of Kansas, comes back this winter a pronounced enemy of railroads, and gives a des cription of how public men are cre ated and owned in his section by Jay Gould's purse. Gould is trying to con trol the legislatures aud the represent atives in Congress from the states through which bis roads pass. Mr. Anderson says that in his own district not less than oue hundred thousand dollars were distributed to defeat him. He estimates that tbe Missouri Pacific Railroad alone spent $i0u,000 iu at tempting to send the friends of rail roads to Congress from the State of Kansas. Mr. Anderson was formerly a straight out Republican, but he re nounces his old faith aud calls himself a member of the new Republican party, having been re-elected as an anti-monopoly Independent. Two years ago Republican prophets I were positive the country will go to ruiu iu consequeuce of a restoration of the Democrats to power.
