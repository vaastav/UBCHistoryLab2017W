At a recent meeting of the Re publican State Central Committee, called at the instance of the Exec utive Committee, the books and vouchers of the latter were carefully examined, and every 'account found correct. The following well-de served resolution was unanimously passed: Jlesolved, That it is the belief and finding of the Republican Central Committee that the Executive Com mittee have ably and faithfully dis charged all their duties, and by their eflorts have largely contributed to the maintcnanco-of the organization of the party and to its success, for which they deserve tne tnanKs oi an the Republicans of Ohio. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. In our last issue we presented to our readers the annual message of President Grant, which we hope has been carefnlly perused by our read ers. It is very favorably spoken of by the press of the country. The message treats of many de partmental and diplomatic details, together with general foreign and domestic questions, and has an un common variety of matters. The President urges the annexation of San Domingo with a list of benefits to come from it. And ho also advises the pur chase of the Alabama claims by the Government This would open ne gotiations for their amicable settle ment. He thinks the fishing question needs a little honest, earnest, straightforward negotiation. The rights are settled by treaty, and there need be no difficulty defining them. The non-transit of goods would not bo a remedy. The same may be said of our right to the nav igation of the St. Lawrence. We want diplomatic negotiation. We believe we have a valid claim to this navigation by the principles of pub lic law. He favors legislation by Congress to restore specie payment, and that in a few short years the national tax gatherer will be known no more, and that the stamps, the excise on spirits and tobacco, and the tariff on luxu ries which persons can dispense with will furnish sufficient revenue. The President is decidedly favor able to a reform in the civil ser vice, so as to provide lor botu ap pointment and tenure. This ar dent declaration confounds the flunkey journals who, upon the re tirement of Secretary Cox, conclu ded the President was opposed to his reform. me message snows a desire to a full presentation of the business of the country, and concludes with a general statement of the policy of the administration. It must be read in detail in order to appreciate it . The Pittsburg Gazette of the 13th says that yesterday they learned that General Schenck had accepted the English Mission, and would sail in three weeks. Yesterday inform ation comes that he will not be able to leave until after Congress ad journs. Some time ago Brigham Young wits assessed, as trustee of the Mor mon funds, for an income tax of $3D,550, to which the penalty was added. He appealed the case, and it has been decided by tho depart-1 uient that he must pay the tax, but the penalty has been remitted. 

EDITORIAL CORRESPONDENCE. BEAVER, PA., Dec. 12th, '70. I -nwr lourmonuis ciose application in the Sanctum, we were glad, when an op portunity offered itself, for a few days relea.ee from the cares of business. So packing up, in company with our better half, we left ifillersburg, with all its in viting scenes, behind us, and reached Orrville on Thursdav morning in time to make close connection with eastward bound morning express on the Ft Wayne road. .Meeting with a friend there, we all took passage for the quiet old town of Beaver," Pa. As is generally the case, that train was thronged with passengers bound for Pittsburgh some point beyond. The morning was chilly, the ground giving indication here and there that snow had fallen in sections belts as it were, all along the road. Passing along a few miles through a region of snow, we would suddenly come upon a section where not a particle of the'fleecy whiteness could be seen thus alternating from one to the other daring the whole route. Nothing of special interest occurred, however, du ring our journey, other than the oppor tunity of studying human nature, which Is always afforded to the'"careful obser ver. One little incident occurred which gave rise to a good many smiles and sev eral broad grins. While our train was nearing the depot at Alliance, after the customary long whistle was given, and we had entered the suburbs of thetown, the genial representative of the colored race, thinking, doubtless, that it would be a fine opportunity for display ing his oratorial powers, announced the welcome fact that twenty minutes would be given at that station, for dinner, in the following graphic manner: "This here next station that we are coming to, right below here, is Alliance. This here train will stop at this here next station just twenty minutes for break- Cast" As we had by this time arrived at the station, the cars having stopped. we concluded that we had already ar rived at "this here" station, and marched to the music of the gong into the large and commodious dining hall, where a good breakfast awaited us. Having done ample justice to the smoking viands we once more boarded the train and were soon flying along at the rate of thirty miles an hour. About half past ten we struck the Beaver river about tea miles above where it empties into the .Ohio at Rochester. 'A few minutes more and the grand old Ohio lies before us. Rochester lies in the confluence of the Beaver and the Ohio rivers, and is a town -very much scat tered over the hills and along the banks of tho two rivers. It has a population of between three and four thousand. Bridgewater lies on the opposite side of the Beaver river .from Rochester and is connected with it by a toll-bridge. Pass ing through this old town, we ascend a steep hill, and find ourselves inside the corporation of Beaver town, where we alight from our carriage and are wel comed by our friends. Beaver is an old town situated on a level portion of ground between the Ohio and a high range of hills, an'd ly ing fully one hundred feet above the surface of the river. Its population is about three thousand. In a business pointof view, it falls below the majority of towns of Its size. Its location is fine, the streets being very wide, and level, During the last two years, more Im provements have been made than during the preceding five or six. Among the finest we notice the Quay Building on Third street, just north of the Court House. This Is a splendid .Mock of brick, built in handsome style. The lower story is used for business rooms, which are veryfine. On the second sto ry, to the right of the spacious hall, is the ofllco of the Radical, a weekly jour nal of eight pages. Col. Quay, who owns the entire building, is also the edi tor and proprietor of this paper. We called on the Col. and found him a very pleasant gentleman, and a man able to hold his own in the political field. The Radical is a well printed and ably edited paper. On tne other side of the hall we And law offices, and the rooms of the M. C. Association. This organiza tion is only eight months old, and is now in excellent? running order. Their rooms are pleasantly fitted up, files of all the leading dailies and best weeklies are found upon the racks, and the tables are covered with choice magazines. The library, as yet, contains only about two hundred volumes. Itev. Mr. Taylor of the Methodist Seminary, is the Presi dent of the Association. The upper story is occupied by the" Odd Fellows and the Masons. Their lodges are said to be elegantly fitted up. The next new building that attracts cur attention is the Methodist church, built on the site of the old one. This is fine brick building, with basement story, and built throughout after the modern style. Its steeple is one hun dred and thirty feet high. It cost about twenty thousand dollars. One manMr. Pravo, gave six thousand dollars of this amount, and Judge Agnew' fifteen hun dred. The bell Is large and clear in tone, costing one thousand dollars. A great many other new buildings have been erected which we have not time to call attention tp. There are two very fine Female Sem inaries In the town, which are now in full blast The Methodist institution, which is under the care of Rev. R. T. Taylor, has now one hundred and twenty young ladies in attendance. This is at present the most prosperous of the two Seminaries. The Presbyterian school is not so largely attended now as in former years. Some yeara ago, it took the lead of all the other schools. Both the Sem inary buildings are very large. There Is also an excellent Union School build ing. Tho Hey. Dr. Scott; formerly iwiMMik v. i oouiu bun vvmrge, Iyi3 located here and has taken charge, of the Academy, which is gradually growing larger and more widely known. Judg ing from the number of institutions of learning, aii ot wnicii are self-sustai n inar, we can form some idea of tho in. tellectual status of the community. We know of no place where the people are. as a mass, 60 well informed. Quite-a uuuiuer oi iiKsourcu uusincss men have their residences here, either for the purpose of having their children edu cated, or uecausc or the beautiful situa tion, ana convenience to the city. A largo number of the inhabitants are men who have made their fortunes and have settled downnere to enjoy It. There are two papers published in Beaver, tho Itadlcal, which we men tioned above, and the Argus. Both arts Republican in politics. The Local, which was the Democratic organ, sus pended operations about a year ago. Wo called on brother Weyand of the Argus, and found him a genial and courteous gentleman. He is a vigorous writer, and makes'the Argus an attractive local pa per. Wo seldom llnd two more ably edited county papers of the same politics any town of this size. There are many other interesting things about this place that we might mention, but" we lorDear. Standing upon one of the hills over looking the valleys of the Beaver and Ohio rivers, we counted eleven towns in 3ight, situated along cither side of the rivers, in a radius of three miles. These towns are Beaver, Bridgewater, Roches ter. Freedom, Phlllnsbunr. Boulsville. Sharon, Falston, New Brighton, Beaver Falls, and Vanport, of some of these we snail speait fiereamr.

WAR NEWS. The London Times has received telegram from Berlin which says that King William will return to Berlin after the capitulation of Paris, even if the war should continue beyond that time. German,terms of peace are likely to be much more oppressive the longer the French hold out A newspaper correspondent at Berlin telegraphs that Bismarck re iterates his denial that he opposes the bombardment of Paris. It is reported that the Council at Versailles has decided to bombard the city. A Berlin telegram says the bom bardmcnt of Paris has been definite ly decided upon. A report has been received that Havre has been occupied by the uermans. Great excitement pre 7 1 J, , ... vaneu ana troops were arriving in large numbers. A dispatch from Tours reports that there is good authority to be lieve that Gambetta has applied to the Prussians for an armistice, in or der to allow time for the election of a National Assembly. General Ducrot's army is still outside the walls of Paris, occupy ing positions between Wesley, Cres til and Charenton. Another grand attack will soon be made. The rumor that Prussia repudiates the treaty of 1867 neutralizing the territory of Luxemburg is doubted. It is regarded as extremely improb able that Bismarck would, at" this time, thus defy Belgium.
