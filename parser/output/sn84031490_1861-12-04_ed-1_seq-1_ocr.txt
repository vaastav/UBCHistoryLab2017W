The reader of the Message will lie sure o run liis eye hastily over its first half—-the ;sual account of the condition of our for- ugn relations, &c. —to come upon that theme which now occupies the thoughts and taxes the ingenuity of every* man in the land—the relation of the slavery Ques tion to the War. If he is loyal, preferring the preservation of the Union and the vin dication of the Constitution to all else, he will bo gratified by the position that the President has assumed. It is, in our own language and in brief, this: I have olxycd and executed such laws as Congress has made. If Congress should deem it wise to pass a new and more comprehensive act for con fiscating the property (slaves) of rebels, I will assent to it. The Union must be preserved at nil haz ards; uud to preserve it, if Slavery must e.'. let it go. VTc must not be in haste to say that ex traordinary measures must be adopted; but when the necessity for such is apparent, let us have them. Such is our reading of the few and preg nant sentences in which the bearing of the Slavery question upon our national affairs is discussed. These assertions and the cog nate recommendation that the confiscated Macks be colonized In some place of genial climate, at the expense of the Government, :ire the sum total of what our Chief Magis t rate has to say. TVo are not disappointed : nay. the President, always loyal, always earnest, far-sighted and sincere, has gone beyond the bounds which, mentally, we had marked out as those within which hh recommendations would be confined- In that atmosphere at Washington where the influence of the old regime is net dead, where the worship ol man-selling v,"as. until the incoming of the Republican Administration, a pari of every platform and every creed, where slaveiy has reigned v. iiliout question of its supremacy in the .!flairs of the Church and Slate, there was a chance, made more dangerous by the po of ihc officers of the regular army, the il.-nluful position of a part of the Cabinet, and awant of complete comprehension of ihe >pirit cf the people, that the real sentiments i.:‘ the President would be suppressed: and that the hopes of the lighting masses which point to the final employment of all *hv rightful agencies that may be invoked pm down rebellion, and to the removal *-f the cause of the strife, would be disap* i inu-d. The danger has been surmounted* r The cautious language which dir. Lincoln f inploy*, docs not hide from u«, who know die deep moral convictions of the man, the purpose that lie has in view, nor the holy hm«*. which he must fed, of that giant in iquity that has at last brought war and d-- htiltin inu. this land. He has i< me. if not fully up to our advanced posi d >ll. at least within, easy hail of those who have been looking anxiously back to see what progress he would make. Congress will lake him at Ids word. The members of iluit body, if wc may judge by what has transpired already, will interpret his mean ing in a way ■tfith which we even shall he < o:i‘-vnt. Looking out from the porch of the Caphol, uvi-r the heads of one hundred and fifty thousand men who defend the ap pr< aches *e> the viw. against an enemy that b animated and impelled by Slavery; Icg- Ihaing within heating of rebel drums which call the insurgent masses to a cam- for tl;c destruction of flic Couslitution, that Slavery may rule; daily witnesses of the atrocities to which Slavery resorts, and of tire almost superhuman efforts tiiat flic people itavc l,een compelled to put fortji to guard against it? attacks; cognizant in their daily walks of the l.rutalizing effects of Slavery tip on those v, ho are brought within its r. arli, it would be an assault upon their patriotism and sincerity and Chris tianity to say that, confining themselves within the limits that the Constitution prescribes, they will not deal this monster ablnw./cr the Union's safe, that will send it a long way toward its death. In some wav nr another, completing prejudice and harmonizing differences, they will. IV c know not what form their legislation will take; but of this we are assured, and the Hessatre is a warrant for what we say, that in till! deliberate action of the Representa tives of the People,the President will gladly acquiesce. And so we make progress. One after an other the difficulties in the way of a glo rious and enduring triumph go down be fore tlie expressed will and firm determina tion of the people. Thus our reverses and defeats, galling and mournful though they have be.-lt, are turned to the gloty of the < ante. Thus the sentiment of Human Lib <ny. which, thank God! slavery has not i .o. n abh-tocnt-diotn, gathers new strength and vitality. IVe foresee the end, perhaps a l.imr way off, to he reached only through toil ;.mi blood, and after a struggle that skail forever be a conspicuous landmark in the history of the world—a Republic with out a traitor or a slave. Tins 

MISSOURI HEGIRA. Just now our Slate is receiving a large ;jci-csrinn to our population from ourtm liappy fritter State of Missouri. They are pouring in upon us by hundreds every week, the refugees driven from their homes and leaving their all, in their haste to rsf-ajK; from the frightful evils of rapine and murder, initiated by the inhumes of Claib. Jackson, and now deliberately proposed in the recent proclamation of Gen. Price. The Missouri reliel leaders, and those conspiring with them to fasten the State in the fetters of the rebellion, have lost all humanity, and from the semblance of soldiers have come down to the role of blood thirsty robbers if and malignant ruffians, g The alarm among the people of Missouri 1 h immense, and thousands are fleeing be ’■ y< .ml the borders to sock homes in the free ; Bbitf-s. Mark this, that few if any who are not a<-*ivc co-workers with the rebellion go .. Southward. They would not do this were g ihc difficulties of so doing even less than i they arc: even rebel leaders farther South thuve placed their wives and families in the shelter of Northern communities. In :S Flint-lively il is recognized that the only M fcufc refuge is fur without the shadows of % the great prison house now shaking with a H moral earthquake. : j Whal is the duty of our own State and iM lowa to these refugees? The au '% fewer springs to even' lip. They must be iS aided, helped, and that generously. In H communities so located as to receive these unhappy visitors most numerously, sys- H lesnutic aid should be poured in from other sections. Let Chicago give a 5 her response to tins humane call, madtinjnrlm M minenl and pressing by the vicissxtudLus mf 1 the season. We make the proposition' •“* |1 in behalf of our citizens, our large-hearK-u --# Mk. Cou.ter be gent to mate a direct in .ll vesiigation as to ihc number and needs of la refugee from Missouri. All who rc ■|i rncm l JtT this gentleman's thorough work in ■ja the aid of the sufferers by the Great Tor <Si nado, and the fitness he has demonstrated < for missions of Has class, will agree that he is the man for the work. Let Chicago send him at once to learn the necessities of the unhappy fugitive families from Missouri. VOLUME XV. ora WASHINGTON bETTEB. The interesting letter from "Washington, found on the second page, is from Sir. Horace White, who has been editorially connected with this paper for several years. Mr. White will remain at the Capital dur ing the present session of Congress, and correspond for the ThibovE. His letters will prove entertaining and instructive. He is no trimmer or compromiser, but one who believes that to go straight forward in the path of duty is always politic; that the right is ever expedient. And in that spirit he will write. A 

MILITARY COURT. Judge Freese, at Alexandria, in his ca pacity of Provost Marshal, struck the right vein in the adjudications in his Military Court touching lawful claims of loyal creditors of rebels. All that was lacking was an official sanction of similar functions, which may thus establish Military Courts throughout all portions of Secessia, wher ever the Federal arms extend, and wherever the rebels themselves have crushed out the ordinary courts. This temporary substi tute forms one of the excellent recommen dations of the Message. THE SUPREME COURT. That some modification has long been necessary in the system of the Supreme Court, has long been felt by prominent ju rists and by intelligent men of all political creeds, and the recommendation of Mr. Lincoln, which will inaugurate such desired improvement, constitutes one of the most important features of his Message. Of the three several modifications suggested, the last we think will be most likely to com mend itself to adoption, dispensing alto gether with the Circuit Courts, and leaving the judicial function wholly to the District •Couit and to the Supreme Court at the Capitol. WELIi DONE, NEW YORK. Thc reform of this better age of ours is beginning at the great centres. New York yesterday made a political funeral necessary for Fernando Wood. She has now a Slay er who combines, with all the private vir tues of a citizen, the skill and business sa gacity tliat will do her sterling service in the municipal office. George Opdykc is Mayor of New York. She never had a better nor truer man in the Mayoralty. AN ENCOURAGING TOKEN. It is a glorious proof of the increasing humanity -of the age, that a President of the United States has recommended the recognition of two young nationalities com posed of free men of color. The light is dawning upon the colored race, in a move ment like this, which recommends the es tablishment of formal relations between this Government and IXayli and Liberia. THE 

BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. The Board of Supervisors arc now con vened in what, wc beg these gentlemen will remember, must prove the most important session ever held by any similar representa tivesofCook county. Neverbeforehasthe treasury been assailed by so many pressing and actual claims, and inevitably it wil prove to tax payers an expensive cm, that to be covered by the action of their present ses sion. A false or indiscreet selection of men, a yielding to log rolling and chicane in awarding the few places to be filled, will, if a mistake be made, cost the county many thousands of dollars. We write Jiot .to fur ther the interests of any one, for wc have no favorites in the matter, but wc ask the Board of Supervisors to make careful and honest selections of men that are to fill the positions of County Agent and Warden of the Poor House for the coming year, for these positions will, from the existence of the war and present business depression, involve grave and responsible duties. On the Inside. —On the second and third pages will be found the President’s Message; an interesting editorial review of the proposed Canal Enlargement; an important and press ing appeal in behalf of unhappy refugees from the reign of terror in Missouri; au array of facts against Gen. George H. Thomas, in com mand at Camp Dick Robinson, Kentucky; and a variety of interesting miscellaneous mutter, much of which has timely reference to the Great Rebellion. From Cheat mountain) Va. Mr. C. K. Scnddcr, of Lafayette, -lud., who has returned from a visit to Cheat Mountain, says the road between Webster and Hutton ville, sixty-two miles, is lined with the wreck i*f Government wagons and dead horses. Six miles a day is the average travel for a four horse wagon, although a six-horse team with a load of straw hats might be equal to seven or eight miles. Sutlers arc compelled to pay twenty dollars per day for six-horse teams. The snow is fifteen inches deep on Cheat Mountain. Only Two States Left, The National flag now floats over the soil of every seceded State except Alabama and Ar kansas. In Virginia it floats over onc-third of the State; in North Carolina, at Hatteras In let ; in South Carolina, at Port Royal and a half-dozen neighboring Islands; in Georgia, on Tybee Island: in Florida, at Key West, Santa Rosa Island and other points; in Missis sippi. at Ship Island; in Louisiana, atChande leur Island; in Texas, at El Paso; and in Ten nessee, at Bristol, Elizabeth! own, and other points in the eastern part of the Stale. A Doubtful Unionist. Colonel Scgnr. the claimant for a scat in Con gress from the Fortress Monroe district of Vir ginia, is understood to be a conditional Unionist, boldine the position that if the Government at tacks slavery, he will not support war measures.— If. 3’. Tribune, Col. Richardson, of the Quincy (DL) District, presented the credentials of this quasi-scces slonist, and asked to have liim sworn in. Ob jections were promptly made. Wm. Kellogg, of the Peoria District, made a speech, insist ing on giving him a seat, which is not surpris ing, as Segur is one of his own stripe of Unionists, pT The French have been relieved from, their fears of famine, by a supply of two-tliirds of the deficiency. The week previous to the sailing of the last steamer, twenty-eight ves sels arrived in Havre, from New York, with 400,000 sacks of wheat, 00,000 barrels of flour, 2,700 sacks of com, and 300 of rye, and con siderable supplies are still expected. X&T The Washington SepuWean notes it as a sign of progress, that a letter from Lexing ton, Kentucky, says that Joe Holt, of Ken tucky, is getting sick of the business of pro tecting the property of pro-slavery traitors and rebels, and says that the war must take its course, even If It be across the “peculiar in stitution.” j3f“Gen. Fremont attended service a 1 Henry Ward Beecher’s Church, on Sunday last, and the congregation rose m mane as the General and Mrs. Fremont entered. Mr. Beecher’s discourse was on “Greatness.*’ Af ter the service the people made a rush for the General’s pew, and detained him half an hour with hand-shaking; and when he was seated in his carriage, at the church door, they crow ded the street and gave him three cheers. The election of George Opdykc as Mayor of New York, is a hopeful indication of , reform in the badly mamiged municipal affairs of that city. We hope he has a good Board of Aldermen. He had a good ticket in the field wi:hbim,a* will be appreciated when it is, known that Samuel B. Buggies, well known for his interest in the Eric Canal, was one of the candidates. £3> v Senator Andy Johnson, of Tennessee, bar nut taken his seal in Congress, this winter, but remains with the gallant East Tennessee troops in Kentucky, to cheer them by his per sonal presence, to see that all their wants arc supplied, and to accompany them when they advance to drive the rebel invaders from their homes. Also, John 8. Phelps, of Springfield, Mo., will not take his seat in Congress, at present, if at. ail tliis winter, having duties that are quite as important as commander of a regiment of his loyal neighbors. E3lU Scene —The headquarters of Gen. Paine at Paducah. Enter elderly Kentuckian In quest of his fugitive chattel. Oai. ihjne—Well, sir, are you and your fam ily loyal? Kmtuck. —l have one son in the rebel army. There arc two at home. Gen P.—Well, are you and your boys at home aiding the Government ? Kentuck. —No, sir; wc remain strictly neu tral Gen. P —Then you must excuse me if I re main strictly neutral between you and your nigger. I cannot allow you within my lines. Exit Kentuck, in disgust, deeming this a Painc-ful application of strict neutrality. CgT Geo. Opdyke, the telegraph informs us, is elected Mayor of New York; a great tri umph, indeed, and still greater if the follow ing be true—a single selection from a large pile of abuse in the scw York Herald: 

OPDTKE AND EMANCIPATION. All who desire that the Union array shall in* ecribe upon their banners the war cry of emanci pation had better vote Tor Opdrkc for Mayor; bat • such of our citizens as are anxious for a restora tion of the Union win give Opdyke a wide margin on election day, and vote for some other man for Mayor. The oyster trade of New York annual ly, for several years preceding the war, ranged from fifteen to twenty millions of dollars. The war has reduced it nearly one-hali; from interference with the sources of supply, and the fact that many of the oystermen have gone to the wars, and more particularly because so Large a share of the most liberal consumers of stewed and raw arc now firing on hard bread. psf° The Emperor Nap. lias delighted his people, and surprised the world, by his recent surrender of the Imperial prerogative of extra and supplementary credits. As indicative of the importance of the measure it is stated that in 1859 this supplementary expenditure amounted to SO,000,OOOf; in ISGO, to 115,000,- OOOf, and during the present year, already, to 1,000,000,000f, The Missouri Democrat says that on Wednesday last, J. G. Buell, a lawyer, and Ed ward Murphy, surveyor of St. Francois county, Missouri, had a rencountre in Farmington, in which shots were exchanged without injury, when Mr. Murphy drew a bowic knife, and stabbed Mr. Buell, fatally, it is supposed. The cause of the difficulty was not stated. Both gentleman are highly respected. 53f Think of it, the amount of free talk that Wasliington is to hear, in the course of the forthcoming lecture scries, winch announ ces the names of Messrs. Henry Ward Beecher, Greeley, Wendell Phillips, Emerson, Chapin, Bayard Taylor, and other able and eloquent men, who have never been heard iu that city. From its former condition of misery at cotton prospects,the London Timeshas passed ton stage of comparative content at what It avows to be after all a blessing in disguise, the short supply of the raw staple having an swered the valuable end of working off a large overplus of cotton goods. pgr The following State appointments have been made in Indiana: Dr. A. C- Crothcrs, Superintendent of the Jeffersonville Railroad, has been appointed Director of the Southern Penitentiary, vice John W. Ray, appointed CoL of the 49th reg iment. Dr. Helm, of Rushville, is appointed Sulking Fund Commissioner, vice J. Jcnkinson, re signed. There Is one infallible test. Every Federal commander who sympathizes with slavery, will put that sympathy foremost in his army orders. His pro-slavery proclivities will tinge all his military acts. On Sunday evening fifty-five rebel pris oners of war arrived, in St. Louis from Linn county. This increase swells the number now in the St. Louis military prison to one hun dred and fifteen. Some of tlic prominent MissouriUnlon i=ts greatly deprecate the extensive publicity given in loyal papers to Price’s late proclama tion, saying it was just what lie wanted. gSf'Tlic lake fleet of revenue cutters,ordered for coast service, were to reach Montreal on Wednesday,(to-day,) and make all exertions to get through before the close of navigation. £gr > On Saturday the house of D.

[Louisville Correspondence of tte Cincinnati Com* merciaL, Dec. Ist.] The rebel chieftain, Zollicoffer, has had al most as much uncertainty of location in the eves of newspaper readers, during the last two months, as the notorious Jeff. Thompson. Since his retreat to the fastnesses of the Cum berland Gap, particularly, rumor has had him in succession at half a dozen different points. As early as ten days ago it was believed at headquarters in this city that he had joined his command to the main body of the rebel array under Gen. Johnston, and that it formed the right wing of the same. I combatted this belief at 'the time in my army corres pondence, and positive information arrived here vesterdav removes, at last, all doubts as to' his recent movements and present whereabouts. In accordance with orders received previous to the uprising of the East Tennessee Unionists, he fell hack from the Gap, after leaving a small force, comprising about one-third bfhis brigade, to dispute the rumored advance of the Federals, and ar rived at Knoxville about twelve days ago. His troops were in a deplorable concition— clad in rags, half-starved, and almost with out transportation. But nevertheless he made but a short rest at Knoxville, and the bridge burning on the East and Georgia railroad having made transportation by rail be tween Knoxville and Nashville slow and tedi ous, he marched overland through Boane, Morgan, Fentress and Overton counties,Tenn., via Kingston and ’ Montgomery, aboutt a week ago,and has since pushed onward through Albany'and Monticello, Wayne county, and ac cording to the latest accounts, had even cross ed the Cumberland, and was making for James town, Bussell county. A movement In Kentucky. [From the Cincinnati Gazette, Dec. 3.] We have news this morning, by way of In dianapolis, that an engagement is expected oa the right wing of onr army in Kentucky, be tween Breckinridge and Crittenden. The opposing forces, however, would seem to be yet at a very peaceable distance from each other. Breckinridge is at Hopkinsville, far ther south than Bowling Green, and but twenty miles from the Tennessee lino. Crit tenden is at Calhoun, on the lower Green river, fifty miles from- Hopkinsville m an air line.

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.} Washington, December 3,1661. Advices from Fortress Monroe bring a de nial of the Government dispatches received from Richmond on Monday, that the rebel Capital had been removed from Richmond to Nashville. Spies say that intense excitement was caused at Richmond by the decision, and this may have caused the change in purpose. There arc from 15,000 to 30,000 troops at Richmond. Eight thousand five hundred men from Fitz John Porter’s, Smith’s, and McCall’s Divisions to-day attempted to cut off the body of about 2,000 rebel cavalry who have recently, from time to time, appeared in the vicinity of Hun ter's Hill, but the rebels had fied. Only a small picket force of about twenty was discov ered. The bill to be introduced by Senator Trumbull, of Illinois, provides for abso lute forfeiture of all property of rebels who are beyond the reach of Federal process. All property in insurrectionary districts to be seized and appropriated by the military pow ers, and that found in the districts where it can be reached by legal process to be confis cated through, the courts. All the proceeds of property confiscated, after payment of ex pense, and just claims of loyal creditors, to be applied to the reimbursement of loyal citi zens despoiled of theirproperty by the rebels, and the balance to paying the expenses of suppressing insurrection. The rebel owners of slaves arc to forfeit all their rights to them, the negroes to become free, and it is made the duty of the President to provide for their colonization so far as they may be willing to go in some tropical country, where they can have the protection of the Government, and be secured in their rights as freemen. The Senate will order a committee of in quiry whether disloyal persons occupy sente in tliat body. Bright is in danger. In Senator Wilkinson’s bill, to be introduced to-morrow, Section one grants 'all rights and privileges heretofore granted to officers, musicians and privates of the regular army to volunteers of the same, who are to form, and to be hereaf ter considered part of the regular army. Second second provides that all volunteer regiments he considered os regiments ofin fantry and numbered in the same series as the regular regiment of infantry, and the oldest volunteer regiments to be numbered 20th, and the next oldest 21st, and so on. Sections third and fourth apply same princi ples to cavalry and artillery. Section fifth provides that promotions here after be made os heretofore, except that no re gard be had to the fact that the vacancy to be filled occurs in an old regular, or a new vol unteer regiment orthatanoflicerto be promo ted belongs to an old or new regiment. Section sixth provides that all commissions issued by the Governors to volunteer officers be considered the same as if issued by the President, and officers to take rank according to date of their commission. Section seventh provides that the President fill all vacancies henceforth occasioned in vol unteer regiments. W. G. George, of Indiana, is appointed Ad jutant General to General Milroy. The reports that Col. Kerrigan was sentenced to be shot, arc utterly groundless. He has not yet been tried by a court martial. Two deserters, Wm. McDcaland Jno. Wors dal, came witliin McCall's lines yesterday, from Ccntrevillc, the first is an English boy, of 20 years, the second a Scotch lad of 19 years, both belonged to vhc 6th Lousiaua regiment, Col. Seymour’s. They say that 60,000 men are encamped at Ccntrevillc, under Gens. Beaure gard and Kirby Smith, the camps being C or 7 miles long, and 3 or 4 wide. The prisoners taken by Gen. Blenkcr arc Wm. H. Dennis, and Alex. Smith, of Rector town, Both were born in Fauquier county, Virginia, and belonged to Company H, 6th regiment, and Wise Dragoons. The troop theyjbelongcdto was led by Lieut. Moorehead, and consisted of about thirty horse, L They left their camp, two miles this side of : Ceutreville, for foraging purposes. Another part of the troop was engaged further distant, i A later report adds that a picket guard of 13 . men of a New York German regiment were captured by rebel cavalry, the cavalry getting around them through woods.

FROM ST. liOtTSS. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.! St. Lons, December 8,1881. A gentleman from Rolla states that the or der against fugitive slaves enteringcampis not observed there, the colored contrabands being treated os strange white persons are, neither allowed more liberty or restricted to less. The blacks, dismissed by Hallcek’e order, arc just outside the lines, and that is alt They could easily get in again if pursued by rebel owners. Gen. Pope Is in command at Syracuse, and Sherman at Sedalia. The latter retains the gruff manner noticed In Kentucky. There was trouble in Col. Olmstead’s Ger man Home Guard Regiment, to-day, caused by an attempt to transfer them to the State service. There was talk of mutiny and several companies were ordered to load, to repress it. But the difficulty was adjusted by a suspension of the transfer till further investigation. The river is full of ice to-day. All the camps in Missouri have been visited by snow storms since Sunday. * - FROM BAFTIMOKE. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.")

New York, Dec. 8. —Mr. Butterfield, mate of the brig Grenada, who has been a prisoner at Charleston, has arrived here. He reports that the forts on OtherandPhmnis Islands were evacuated and blown up on November 13th. Great excitement prevailed at Charleston, and a meeting was held as to the propriety of burning or surrendering the city. The Mayor was in favor of surrendering, and so were the people generally, but the Governor decided it must be burned. NEW 

TORE CITY ELECTION. Glorlone Result—Opdyke Elected. New Yobk, Dec. 3.—The municipal election in this city, for a Mayor - for two years, oc curred to-day, and was a three-cornered fight with a close vote, with the following result in dicated by the returns footed up at half-past 8 o’clock this evening: George Opdyke, (Republican)....

On motion, the credentials were referred to the Committee on Elections. On motion of Mr. 

WASHBURNE, of HI., the President’s Message was referred to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union, and his motion for printing 50,000 extra copies was referred to the Committee on Printing.

WICKLUTE, of Ky., saldhc had intend deto prepare and submit a proposition some thing like an obituary notice 01 bis colleague. [Laughter.] The latter was not, as the reso lution asserted, in armed rebellion, but heads a provisional government in Kentucky—a revolutionary convention. Not satisfied with the treatment of this Government to maintain the Union, nor satisfied with the course of his own State, he (Burnett) has assumed the im portant duty of organizing another govern ment for the tender protection of the lives, property, and liberty of the people of Ken tucky, ‘and in this undertaking employed Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat aesimnlated in name but In the deeds of Simon Gueltercz, who once headed the In dians in Ky. Three times has the gallant State of Kentucky declared by overwhelming ma jorities, she would not leave the United States to run after strange gods or for the so called “Southern Republic.” Notwithstanding berrepcated declarations for the Union, and in violation of the well known sentiments of'tlic people of Ky., they had been told the object of the Convention and of the so-called South ern Confederacy was to relieve them from a despotism and to protect their rights. And we were deceived; we were told by the Ex ecutive of this so-called Southern Confederacy it was intended to respect the condition of Kentucky, which it was pretended would not be donebv the Government of the United States. The Union men of Kentucky never did deny the right of the Federal Government to occu py its soil for the exercise of the purposes im plied by the Constitution. Kentucky did ac knowledge her obligations, and expressed her intention to fulfill them. The proclamation of the Governor of Kentucky deceived the people, but the Legislature denounced it. Two messages of peace were sent to the Exec utive of the United States, and one to the President of the Southern Government, to know what was intended to be done with Kentucky. The former said it was intended to maintain thehxwand the Constitution, and that this was believed to be the will of the people of Kentucky. The latter declared that he intended to respect the neutrality of Ken tucky as understood by tbe secession party of the Skate, but the Southern President did not tell them he had matured a plan to assail them at the different points, nor did he tell them there was on the statute book of the Southern government a law-_providing money and means, not to sus tain Kcntucky'ag.iinst oppression but to carry her into tbe Southern Confederacy against a majority of two-thirds of the entire State. The present provisional Governor of Ken tucky was sent to sec the government at Richmond. Meanwhile, Burnett is at the head of the new order of allairs, in the discharge of his duty, and an armed force has been gathered, composed of young, desperate, reckless men, commanded by Buckner. In conclusion, Mr. Wiekliffesaid: “With the blessing of God, I predict that bv the 25th of December no rebel loot will be found on the soil of Kentucky.” [Applause.] The resolution for the expulsion of Burnett was adopted. Adjourned. From Washington. Washington, Dec, S. —This morning the pickets of Gen. Blehker’s brigade were at tacked, at Annandalc, by a party of secession cavalry, who came across our men very unex pectedly. Sharp firing took place, and the re sult was, one rebel was killed and two wound ed and taken prisoners. A most important order will soon be issued from Headquarters, informing the Governors of the several free States that no more regi ments, batteries, or indeperdent companies, must be raised or received by them, except upon the requisition of the War Department. The regiments, &e. , now forming, will be com pleted, unless it shall be deemed more advan tageous to the service to assign the men al ready raised to incomplete organizations actu ally in the field. General Superintendents of the volunteer and recruiting service will be appointed for all Stales, and recruiting in each will be direct ed upon the system pursued iu the reguhtr army These* Superintendents will be offi cers* of the regular army—retired officers, if possible, or officers of artillery not serving m the field. Depots for the collection and instruction of recruits, under the command of the Superintendent, will be estab lished •at the following places, and such other as shall be considered advantageous in each of the States. Those in the "West "are: Minnesota, Fort Snclling; lowa, Davenport; Wisconsin, Mad ison; Missouri, Jefferson City or Benton Bar racks; Michigan, Detroit; Illinois, Spring field ; Indiana, "Indianapolis; Ohio, Columbus, Kentucky, Louisville. The enlistment papers of the volunteers will be the same as for reg ulars. Clothing will be issued to them at the State depot. Commanders of regiments in the field, wanting troops, will make requisitions directly on the Superintendents for their re spective States. No more cavalry will be ac cepted by the Government, and it is the pur pose of the Commanding General to muster out of the scrviceall cavalry recruits in incom plete regiments, unless they will consent to come in as infantry. The number of the cavalry already amounts to between sixty and seventy thousand—much more than the Government can use. Information has been received here that one clause iu the treaty with the Mexican Govern ment provides for a loan of £10,000,000 by our Government, to be famished in five annual sums of $2,000,000 each, in return for the mer cantile advantages and transit of U. S. troops through Mexican territory. Gen. McClellan is understood to have made the most urgent presentation to the President in favor of a regular and systematic exchange of prisoners, fie will probably succeed m having his views approved and acted on. There has been no advance of rebel pickets upon our lines, as has been stated. On the contrary, our pickets have advanced into the enemy’s country. .. _ , McCall is moving towards Leesburg, and Gen. Smith and Gen. Porter arc extending their lines forward, while McDowell and Franklin are watching the enemy’s centre, which is growing weaker and weaker every day. I am enabled to state in the most positive manner, that the struggle is over, and that the President’s conservative policy is sustained by ' his Cabinet with entire unanimity. No flag has been flying from the rebel bat teries on the Lower Potomac for some time, until a few days since, when the Southern Confederacy flag wasnnforled, and it is now displayed all along their Imc. Secretaries Cameron and Seward were sere naded to-night, but only the latter appeared. He simply complimented the music, and sta ted that in tea days tho country would rejoice at great news...

Repfcv&d Skirmish near Chilllcolhe —■Movements in the Southwest. Si layers, Doe. 3.—Passengers by the North Missouri train report that It is rumored along thg road that an lowa regiment and a force ofrcbels under CoL Stein had met near Cbillicojiic,where a sharp skirmish took place, resulting In the rout of the rebels. It needs confirmation. Stein with his band are known to be somewhere in tliat neighborhood. Advices from Rolla, datcd’Deccmber 2, say that two scouts arrived there from Springfield, and report that they heard on the road that McCulloch, after going a short distance south ward, turned his course to the east for Iron ion, or, as some thought, for Pocohontas, in Northeastern Arkansas. Afterward it was re ported that he had passed four miles south of that place. Capt. Washburn, of the Ninth lowa, and CoL Vandcvcr, stationed at Franklin, left Sul livan on Thursday, with twenty men, on a scouting expedition to the Southwest. They followed up the Brazile river, and had a sharp skirmish with a party of rebels, taking all of them prisoners. Col. Gustavos A. Smith, of the 35th Illinois regiment, is reported quite ill. A gentleman who left Osceola last Saturday states that Price’s army, at that place, is not over five thousand men. A large number of his troops hud left him, or been sent of by him, and gone to the Missouri river counties. Those at Osceola were in a destitute condi tion, ami suffering greatly for want of clothing and provisions. .95.959 ,24.583 .24.066 Interesting from tlie Sonlh. Rebel AcccOuts of Federal itovements. Washington, Dec. 2.—Tnc Richmond Hr- of Friday, he 20th ult., contains the following telegrams: Chakleston, Thursday, Nov. 3-S.—A courier who arrived this morning, says that a skirm ish took place near Buckingham on Saturday last, between the Confederates and Union invaders. The Unionists attempted to laud, but were driven off One of our men was slightly wounded by a shell. It is reported that the enemy lauded yester day at Bennett’s Point, at the mouth of the Aehebo river. Four Union steamers shelled Atto Island, north of St. Helena, on Monday, and then landed. They now hold entire pos session of St. Helena' Sound. A number of lights passed our bar on Monday niirht. and it is presumed that the Union fleet were eu route South. Savannah, Nov. 2S.—The papers of this morning state that Fort Pulaski yesterday threw a few shot and shell at the camp of the Federate on Tybee Island, which caused a Bull Run stampede to safer quarters. There are now nix Union vessels inside the bar, and five outride. Ltkcubvrg, Ya., Nov. 2S.—Floyd’s com mand expects to go into winter quarters at Peterstown, Monroe county. The roads are almost Impassable, and it is thought neither the Yankees nor ourselves can accomplish anything until next Spring. Baltimore, Dee. 3.—The boat from Old Point has. arrived. The following items are gathered from Southern papers. The reported removal of the Capital from. Richmond to Nashville is incorrect. The Southern press is advocating the abol ishing of the elective franchise. The latest advices from Pensacola, represent that the fight had not occurred. Accounts say that had the fight continued, Fort Mcßca M ould hare been destroyed. No particulars of the affair are given. The planters throughout the Southern sea board are represented to be destroying tbeir stocks, lest they should fidl into the hands of the Yankees.

Washington, Dec. 3.—The Madrid CSmwj- recently received here, contains the Following paragraph, which shows the friendliness of feeling existing be tween the Spanish Government and the Church parlv of Mexico: “Yesterday took place the long announced visit to her Majesty, the Queen, by General Miramou. Ex-President of Mexico. Our august cousin re ceived him with her usual amiability, as also did the Kin?, her husband, who was seated at her side. The conversation lasted for more than a quarter of an hour.” From intelligent sources, it seems there is some foundation for the report that Queen Is abella has made a secret treaty with the Empe ror Napoleon, oedinghim the Volcanic Islands, provided he will assist her in her designs against Mexico.

Washington, Dec. 3.—The Secretary of the Treasury’s report will not be sent to Con gress before* Friday. % Movements of McCulloch and Price in Southwest Missouri. The Kolia correspondent of the St. Louis Democrat writes, December Ist: The rebels, on their march from Springfield to the Osage, were hurried up by a rumor that the Federal forces were crossing the White river into Arkansas, for the purpose of cutting oil their rear. Hence the burning and devast ation which was made of the conrtry, in order to discommode the former, and prevent its oc cupation by the "Unionists. Col. Clarkson left Springfield on Sunday, 34th, for Osceola, bringing up the rear. It is well settled that McCulloch refuses to co-operatc with the redoubtable Price. The former was heard to remark, -“Price has gone north cn another bell-trip, and may go alone.*’ A gentleman who called on McCuHochat Mr. Graves’s house, his headquarters while in Springfield, found the rebel General in a moody state. He was reading, at the time, a copy ’of the Missouri RepuWcan of the 16th nit.* and appeared absorbed with Us contents. He had taken much pains to send for the pa ■ icr. McCulloch when last heard of was at ! Little Tork, headed in the direction of Arkan sas. McCulloch has a “Col. Jim Lane” in his division, from Marshall, Harrison county, Texas. The party of Texas Rangers under Col. Stone, who visited Lebanon, joined Mc- Culloch the day he left. McCulloch's troops consisted of five regiments of cavalry, with out tents. It was stated that 5,000 rebel Indians were moving north to the west of Fort Scott, to act in "conjunction with Price. One of the rebel officers (Livingston) had returned from an expedition, and made his brags that he had hung thirteen and shot thirteen more k ‘Union abolitionists, and sent them to .” A friend, who has a copy of Price’s proc lamation, deems the publication injudicious. He says the publication by the Union papers of liis documents is precisely what Price wishes. He alludes to the term of service about to expire of many of his men, calls for ‘recruits, and boasts of the achievements already made over the Federal forces, with scant supplies and a deficient military chest. The train is on the move. The BKlssonri Hegira. [From the Missouri Democrat, Dec. 3d.] The fact that a number of destitute and suf fering families, refugees from the southwest counties of Missouri, where Price’s plundering and thieving army are devouring the substance of the inhabitants, have within the last few days arrived in this city, with the little house hold goods they had saved from the general waste and destruction, has already been an nounced. Yesterday a stronger illustration was given of the amount of suffering, depriva tion and misery, and the extent of desolation and utter poverty now existing among the families of all that region. Twenty or thirty families, consisting of worn down, suffering and apparently ruined men, half-clothed, cold, hungry and woebe gone women and children, drawn in creaky, broken wagons, by half-starved mules and oxen, following the almost worthless frag ments of furniture and goods they were able to gather from their household wreokßj pre sented a sad and moving spectacle. Their ap pearancc was that of fugitives from destruc tion. These people arc fleeing from starva tion and death. Many of the families who arrived in the city yesterday were provided with quarters temporarily at the public lodg ing house on Chcsiint street, between M*un and Second streets. , .. . * Through the generosity of the kind people in the vicinity, the immediate wants of the sufferers were supplied, but there still re mains much to he done for them bj the chari table. Contributions in clothing, hats, caps, shoes, &c., for the little ones, dresses for the grown females, would afford great relief The Chief of Police has bee;n busy providing for them, and has concluded .to keep them in their present quarters *5, the expense of the city, until tbey are better prepared to proceed on their journey. The emigrants arc mostly from Laclede county, and the neighborhood of Springfield. They state that since the re cent- battles in and near Springfield, they have been deprived of nearly everythinir, and were at List compelled to seek a llvmg'clscwhere. They report that the road between here and Springfield is. literally lined with destitute : jimilics, who have also been forced to quit the Slate. The majority of them arc on their way to Sangamon county, Illinois. If any of onr readers wish to see some of the bitter results of the civil strife now going on in this State, let them visit the apartment we have named. A more heart-rending specta cle is seldom presented. And such of our kind citizens who desire to do a real act of charity, have an opportunity in contributing iheirmitc to the relief of the distressed families. The Rebel Steamer Nashville, [Correspondence of ths New York Herald.] The Rebel steamer Nashville, flying the the rebel flog, has arrived at Southampton. She landed Captain Nelson and crew, twenty nine in number, of the American ship Harvey Birch. Captain Nelson reports that he left Havre on the 17th instant, bound for New York, in ballast; on the 19th was brought to by the Nashville, who at once ordered the Captain and crew on board the steamer allow ing them to take a few of their effects and fresh provisions. Captain Petrram then or dered the Harvey Birch to be fired, and Lud alongside till she burned to the water’s edge. Captain Nelson immediately placed himself in communication with Captain Bristow*, United States Consul at Southampton. The Nashville is still lying in the river, living the rebel flag. Captain Nelson says that Com mander Pegram states that he has no commis sion from the Southern government as a war steamer, yet declares it not a privateer. No Southem'Comuiissioncrs arrived by the Nash ville. The whole crew ofthc Harvey Birch, except the Captain, were placed in irons till the arri val at Southampton. Exhortations were made to induce the Captain and crew to take the oath to the rebel government. Captain Pe srram communicated with Mr. Yancey. The Nashville will refit at Southampton.
