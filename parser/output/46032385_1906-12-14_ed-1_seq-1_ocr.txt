THEY "DONE" WITH IT? The New York Press, a republican paper, says: "The American people are done with this system of unrestrained corporations depriving a whole nation of its rights and liberties whilo- the corporate powers declare that their privileges are sacred as their protection in them by the constitu tion is indefeasible. And if the corporations and their legal retainers can not see what every one else sees blazoned in the skies, the American people are also done arguing with them. They have only the' answer of Napoleon to the stupid Archduke of Austria who, slave of worn-out for malities, could not comprehend the fact of the French republic. 'France,' said Napoleon, just at the moment he was crushing the shell of Aus trian pretensions under his irresistible heel, 'is like the sun; so much the worse for him who can not see it!'" If the American people are really anxious to be "done with this system: of unrestrained cor porations depriving a whole nation of its rights and liberties" then they will remove from power the party which habitually derives its campaign fund from these same corporations and habitually legislates in their favor. CONSTITUTION FOLLOWING THE FLAG On another page will be found the message of the president just sent to congress relative to Porto Rico. It will be gratifying to democrats to know that the constitution is at last following the flag. The position taken by the president in favor of conferring full citizenship upon the Porto Ricans will he approved except that it ought not to be described as the conferring of citizenship. The hill ought to simply recognize that the Porto Ricans now possess full citizenship by virtue of the fact that they are a part of the "United States. In 1900 the democrats in sisted that the constitution keep company with our flag wherever that flag floated over American territory. The democrats insisted then and in sist now that we can not properly have different kinds of citizenship full citizenship in the United States, semi-citizenship in Porto Rico and vassal age in the Philippines. There is no twilight zone between citizenship and the condition of the sub ject. Democrats will rejoice in this new recognl 1 tion of the correctness of the democratic position. Porto Rico ought to have a territorial govern ment, reserving the right to add to the territory from time to time as conditions may require. When Porto Rico became a part of the United States she had representation in the Spanish legis lature, and while it will be some time before the people of Porto Rico are ready for statehood, they ought to have the territorial form of government and a delegate in congress. 

WELCOME TO THEM "-?Z" Steffi fflmP S? 2 "'l '-V' && -i Democracy "There are a few left, Mr. President; you might as well get clear off your old platform and take 'em." Democracy Must Motfe Forward There are increasing evidences that the dem ocrats who call themselves conservative are quiet ly laying their plans for the capture of the next democratic convention. Attention is called to the matter, not that there is much danger of the plan succeeding:, but that the readers of The Commoner may know what Is going on. The argu ment made two years ago by the friends of Judge Parker was that President Roosevelt was unsat isfactory to the business element and that a con servative democrat like Judge Parker would be able to poll a large republican vote. Tt ought to have been plain to the party leaders that a candidate conservative enough to draw corpora tion republicans to his support would not ho radi cal enough to hold the democratic voters, but It was thought that liberal campaign contributions could more than make up for defection among the rank' and file. As unreasonable as were the arguments made, they were successful, and the democratic party made an experiment that will not be repeated, at least for some years. After the election the conservative element seemed to be entirely satisfied to allow the organization of the party to pass into the hands of those who believe In positive and aggressive democracy. . As the campaign approaches, however, there are indica tions that some of the conservatives would rather keep the party In a minority than for it to take a position on the side of the people. The Brooklyn Citizen has an editorial based upon the possibility of Mr. Roosevelt being a candidate again, which suggests that the next democratic convention may take the conservative side against the radicalism of the president. The democrats may as rtll recognize th situation and prepare for it I the first place, there Is no probability or prospect of the president being a candidate ai;aln. He has so announced, and it Is only fair to him to take him at his word. Even if he desired to he nominated, he would have difficulty in securing a nomination. There is a division in the republican party, and that division extends from the top of the party to the bottom. Mr. Roosevelt's radicalism has displeased the re publican leaders, and his last message has very much aggravated the situation. The republicans who do not favor the pn-silent's policies, when supported by the republicans who earnestly op pose a third term, would he strong enough to prevent a renomination, so the thought of his nomination can safely be put aside. Even if he were nominated, It would not be good policy for the democrats to plan a conserva tive campaign. If Mr. Roosevelt were a candidate, .It would not only be wise but necessary for the, democrats to make a radical fight. If the demo cratic party were to attempt to attack the presi dent for endorsing democratic ideas, It would lose more democrats than it could gain republi cans. If, on the other hand, it were to remain steadfast to democratic ideas and use the presi-. dent's arguments to strengthen the democratic position, it would hold the democratic vote and the conservative republicans would be left to put up a candidate of their own and thus divide the republican strength to the advantage of the democrats. But let us consider what is probable. There Is no radical republican to succeed the president. Senator LaFollette would be his natural succes sor if Mr. Roosevelt's ideas controlled the repub lican convention, but the republican party is not yet ready to nominate a man like LaFollette.
