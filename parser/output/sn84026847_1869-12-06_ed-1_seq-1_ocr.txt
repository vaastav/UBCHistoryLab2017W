Th? late election for Delegate from Grant and Hardy illustrates tke blun ders which must be perpetrated so loDg as the contents of the Code are unknown. In this case, Grant county under the old regulation would bave been enti tled to the Delegate, but the Code changed this and gave the next Dele gate to Hardy. Not knowing this, the people proceeded according to the former rule and elected a gentleman from Grant. The Moorefield Advertiser says: We are sorry that a mistake was made in the selectiou of a candidate against the Radical nominee for the House of Delegates from luis Delegate District in the late eleotion. We have beun in formed, and upon examination find it to lie the fact, that the law as contained is the New Code requires the delegate from this district to be ohoaeu iu 18G9to couie from this county. We don't see bow this mistake can be remedied now without a new election, unless the Leg islature will legalize the election of Mr. Judy. He is tbe choice of the people, and it can do no harm to any one to do so. This is one of the fruits of acting under a Code of laws unpublished and unknown to even those compelled to ad minister them. It is to be hoped that Judge Furgerson will soon give the Code to the public. Eaterprlse. The Steubenville Gazette republishes from th? Columbia, (Pa.) Herald an ad vance copy of the President's message. How the Herald obtained it has not transpired, but we tbink it may be re lied upon as an accurate summing up of the Presidential proceedings during the past season. It reads thus: 

ADVANCE COPY O* THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Gentlemen of the Senate and House of JUpnsentatiret: As the cnstodian of the White House and stables attached, and valuable horses iu the latter, it becomes my duty to inform yon that I visited Long Branch, drove over all the roads there and danced the Lancers with Olive Logan, and I hope that 1 shall do it aguiu. 1 rode over the Erie railroad and didn't get killed, aud I hope I shall do it agaiu. I 1 visited Pennsylvania, in tbe oil re gion*. fished for trout out of season and didn't get tieied, and I hope I shall visit again and catch more trout. I visited Khode Island aud uttended a clam-bake, which 1 should not have attended if I had not got there, and I hope I shall go there again. 1 visited the White Mountains, aud I hr-.v many Yaukee notions, which I shonld not have seen if I had cot been th' re, and I hope I shall see them again. i visited Saratoga Springs, and changed my drinks, which came nearer to killing ine than the ride on the Eric R.ulroad. I chauged back my drinks aud ?oou became able to dance the L:i::cers, and I hope the change will con tinue. 1 visited Peunsylvauia again, and stopped at Lancaster, but I should not have stooped if the cars had not stop ped for a little while. 1 Uave visited Bonner and Wilkes sev? ral times. I drove their horses, aud I hope 1 shall drive thein again. I visited tho Maryland State Fair. They had ti l. e horses and old rye. and 1 hope I shall attend it again. I have put all my rclatious and my wife's relations in office. They have all money, and I hope tbey will a'ftke more tkoney by by it. I have received a greatjiuany presents since I was elected President, and 1 hope I shall be elected again. I don't kuow much about the business of T lie country, hut everybody 1 have appointed to office appears to have plenty of money and I hoj>e other people have plenty of it. I don't know much ubont the gold business, but if any of you wish to know I will ask my wifeabout it. I don't know what the people want, b ;t they want something, and perhaps they will make foe a present ;f you Grakt it. Ural Virginia l.cjjintnnou. Urnrml unit Particular. The precept requiring patience t? be allowed her perfict work is exceedingly brief aud explicit. Ordinarily the duty enjoined is an easy one. But there are times when it is not among the possibil ities. No man of common sense and commou interest in the Statu cau pre serve hi# equanimity while contem plating the history of West Virginia legislation. Throughout the whole of that history we thud the fewest number of acts that have general aims, and of tlieso scarcely any that have promoted the general good. For the rest, private, local or partisan purposes, lie at the bottom. The .Test Oath system was invented to advauot the fortunes of po litical adventurers. The almost iuter miuable discussing of the Capital ques tion have merely represented the rival ry of particular localities. Our legisla tion upon the question of land titles, forfeitures and sales has been largely prompted by land owners and land ? peculators. Oor school laws havs been amended and botched to suit the views of single couuties or of single neighborhoods. Then we have bad special exemptions for delinquent offi cers, for Teachers, for Suitors aud for Lawyers. These with the alteration of county lines, the location of the minor ptiblia buildings, the refunding of taxis in sums ranging from five to twenty dollars, the gerrymandering of judicial districts, the tampering with the elec tion laws, the incorporation of benevo lent societies and the chartering of wild-cat railroad enterprises of one sort or another furnish a fair outline of West Virginia legislation for the past six years. In its general character it is almost contemptible and in its general results it has been positively mischiev | ou<. ' But general complaint is not the pur pose of this article. We merely desire ! to call up a particular point in regard to which the press of the State has been scarcely less derelict in its duty than our various Legislatures iu theirs. We desire to say that the p#0ple of this Slate are now livlllKi baling, working and contracting under a system of laws at whose general character they can only guess and of whose literal purport they know absolutely nothing. Some where in space, borering between the Legislature which launched it and the public at whom it was directed, there ' lingers a monstrous mass of legal ignor- 1 ance styled the Code of West Virginia, It 1 matters little in this connection that ; , the Code may be, and most likely is, the I most abominable aggregation of non-1 sense ever contrived by human stupid- 1 ity. It is the law of the State, the sys tem that control* all business transac tions, governs all Courts, guides all public officers, regulates popular educa tion, provides for the protection and peace of society, and gives life to civil | Government in our midst. It bas been ! | in full operation since April 1st, 1869, I and yet to this day there is not a com- ! plete volume of that Code in existence j in this State. A sum of money sufficient to complete j and publish the laws of three such States ns ours has already been expend ed in the vain attempt to give the peo ple of West Virginia a copy of the laws under which we live. The lowest esti- i mate we have heard put upon the cost of thie Code is $60,000. It bas been printed and reprinted, wo understand, no less than three different- times, arid even now whatever is known of its con tents bas been gathered from fragments that have gotten loose from the clutches that confine the remainder, and obtrud ed themselves into open daylight. A legal gentleman of high standing in this State informed us but a few days ago that from what be bad been able to gather of the incompleteness and incon sistency of this wonderful work, he did not tbiuk it could be put forth in a more than balf-finisbvd condition; that addi tional legislation would bo necessary to supply its deficiencies and correct its irregularities, and that, taking past ex penditures at> a vritferion, at least $00,000 more would be necessary to make it even a tolerably complete and perfect work. If the people were able to stand it, they might not object to seeing tbe "loyal" codifiers and the printers making fine fortunes out of this fat job ; as it is, they no*, only object on the scoro of economy, bnt they protest agaiust the worthless style in which this Code has be^n put together, and especially against the injustice of requiring them to obey it. without letting them know what it is As stated, the Code went into effect April 1st, 1869. Since that time our Courts have been rendering decisions under what, from the best information they could get, they believed to be the law. In many instances, iu the very nature of the case, their information could not be accurate; in mauy it was little better tbau geuoral hearsay, or the transmitted traditions of the legis lative fathers. For exauipie, it is very j very generally understood among the people and the Courts that there is in force iu this State ? "loyal" Test Oath for Suitors. And yet the provision in tbe Code supposed to reqaire tbe Suitor to Lake that Ontb refers for the Oath to a chapter and section which contains no Test Oath at all. In other words, the codi&er bas blundered in annexing bis reference n?tea, and in so doing bas codified tho Suitor's Oath out of exist ence. Two of the State Courts have refused to enforce if on this ground, while in others, as we learn, the prac tice is different. Never having had an exalted opiuiou of tho constitution ality of this Suitor's Oath, wo care little for its fate, but this may be merely a representative blunder, behind which other blunders are mar shalled by legions. Errors of this sort involve necessarily errors in judicial decisions, uud these in turu involve lit igants in incalculable trouble and es pouse. The theme is a fruitful one, and we shall probabiy refer to it again. In the meantime we desire our readers to re dact upon tbe cost and condition of the Code as furnishing one, of the many [claims which "loyal" legislation has | upon popular gratitude. 

STATE ITEMS. The Wrllsbnrg Xeic? Bays tbat there | have lately beeu teu or twelve acces sions to the Presbyterian Church iu tbat town. The late Odd Fellows' demonstration | at Monndsville netted nearly $500. The Adcertiier recoids sundry im provements in the town of Fetterman. Uraftou has l>e?u highly entertained by a Vocal and Instrumental Concert, I followed by a supper. The most inter esting feature of the occasion was a contest for a massive gold ring to be voted to the most popular lady. Miss Mary Kennedy was the snccessful can didate, but through the generosity of the Cornet Band her competitor, Miss Jennie Doonan, was made the recipient of another ring, similar iu all respects to the first. Presentation speeches were made l>y two yonng gentlemen of the place, who aired their historical andj rhet ? rical acquirements quite fearlessly. Clarksburg has no license, bat boon- j tiful supplies of bad whisky. The Clarksburg Tclfjraph says that on Tuesday, 30th nit., Dr. Ramsay cut from the stomach of Mrs. Sutton, living near Romine's Mills, a tumor which had been growing for nearly two years. The i fleshy pari weighed seventeen pounds, and had nearly eight gallons of water secreted in it. The same paper tutjs there will be a greater demand for tenements in Clarke barg next spring than ever before. The Harrisville Star says that Benton Rexroad, a young nan of Ritchie county, whose father was killed at Bev erly in 1863, has becotuo insane. Work on the Kanawha river improve ment has been discontinued in conse quence of the approach of winter. The Wirt County Democrat boasts of a champion rat, lately caoght in Eiiza abetb, measuring seventeen inches from tip to tip, ?Dd weighing nearly two pounds. The Little Kanawha river is still low and the Wirt connty people are suffering for coal. The Democrat says the last bushel is gone and coal stoves are burn ing wood. Barboursville, Cabell county, has a j choir, and a ?orroopondest of the- Pms relieves his mind by a criticism upon its I performances. Among other things he has "at considerable tronble and some expense compiled the following stanzas which are respectfully submitted."

The Supervisors of Greenbrier county advertise for proposals to rebuild the bridge over Greenbrier river on tbe Ka nawha turnpike. 1 homas Tincher, mail earner between Red Sulphur Springs, Monroe oounty, V\est \ irginia, and Dublin, Virginia,] made 310 tries last yo?r, traveling a! distance of 13,0*20 miles. The Union, Monroe county, Register says that a son of Mr. Anderson Brown, who lives on Peters' Mountain, near the Salt Pond, last week captured an enor mous gray eagle, which had devoured on# of his geese. The yonng man found remnants of the goose near his premises, and depositing them in a hollow stomp for bait, he placed a steel trap at tbe entrance. The royal forager was thus caught in a trap. He measured seven feet and two inches from tip to tip of the extended wings. His great fangs measnred two and a half inches, and when extended, inclosed a space be tween their points of 7j inohes in length. The Romney Intelligencer learns that a party of deer hunters from Eastern \ irginia, who Went to the mountains in Pendleton some three weeks ago, for the purpose of hunting deer, had a fine wagon and their camp equipage burned while they were hunting and also some of their valuable dogs spirited away. Deer are being shot in great numbers in Hampshire. Wo extract the annexed items from the Martinsburg Xeic Eaa: Mrs- George Sperow has sold her farm near tailing Waters, this county, to Mr Levi Spitznogle, for $8300. rbe late sown wheat has improved eonsiderably in appearance, during the the past ten days. Hog slaughtering will pretty gener ally commence with the farmers during the next ten pays. Eggs are played oat hereabouts, the liens having laid op for the winter. Small bills of currency for making change are very sr-arce, and large bills for paj'ing debts scarcer. Kev. W. S. Penick held a series of meetings at Mt.

Tho Morgan Mercury says : We Lave been favored with some of the particulars of an extraordinary elopement ease, which came off abont a week or ten days ago, the parties being a colored wan and a white woman, hail ing from Frog Hollow, in this county. The elopement, it appears, was inaugu rated with a view to matrimony ? the twain wendinc their way, arm in arm, to the city of Warfordsbnrg, 'tother side of tliefuot Jordan) Potomac, to have the knot tied ; but In consequence of failure in procuring a minister of the Gospel sufficiently stultified to make the couple " bone of one bone, and flesh of one tlesb." the august affair was in definitely postponed. Want of space precludes the possibility of our giving a more extended notice of this misce genation movement. BfT. nr. FUhrr'a Srrnta Kiflrwrd. Editor* of the : , The Kev. D. W. Fisher, after a week'* mature deliberation, complacently pub lishes his revised and corrected manu script. Some of his mistakes have pru dently disappeared, and for the reasser tion of others he can no longar plead ignorance. The Catholic Chnrch courts the most thorough and impartial inves tigation. She has nothing to fear from ignorance, false history, calumny and 'misrepresentation, the ordinary weapons of her assailants. Let every honest man then examine caretully for himself and take no authority at second band. The substance of Mr. Fisher's dis course, bj kis own showing, is taken from the most bigoted and one-sided sources. He quotes Scbaff, Edgar's "Variations," Gillett's "Life and Times of Ham," the London Timet, the British Quarterly, Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia, tho infidtls Castelar and De L'Anege, the excommunicated friar Hyacintbe, the coudemued Jansenist Pupin, erraneous ly quoted as "Romish," and Harper's Magazine for December should be added to the list. The only Catholic authorities mentioned are Cyprian and Tt-rtnllian, whose texts are not specified, a passige from the New York Tablet, which is cor rect, and the "Roman" historian Hefeie, vol. 1, p. 7. If by this latter name is meant th<? learned Catholic, Doctor Hefeie, of Tnbingen, who wrote a "his tory of tbe Councils," so far from his saying anything to favor the assertion that the first eight Councils were con Yoked by the emperors, he completely re futwit Let Mr. Fisher tell ns whoia b? means by the "Roman" Historian Hefeie Tbe sermon of Mr. Fisher reminds me of the witty description of a magpie's nest by the poet Yriarti. There are in it rags and tags and bobtails, bits and scraps, odds and ends from all quarters. I shall condense tbe saVstaoce of his borrowed materials and answer very britlly. If any man wants more infor mation on any of these subjects, which space will not permit me to develop, let him rome out under his own name and he Kill gei it. How can ice know a General Council tine* the c otuiUi?nt of are unde cided ? Answer: They are not undeci ded. We oar tell general councils only after they are ended. There have been eighteen" so far. All Catholics admit this. If it is so bard to tell a General Council how do yon explain this unan imity f A General Cenncil is a histori cal fact. When the conncil of the Vati can is ended we can tell whether it is] general or not as easily as we can know | a meeting of Parliament or a session of Congress. Is the only scripture tcarrant for General Council} in the Jpotiolic Synod of Jerma-' lem T Answer: No; if there never bad been a council at Jerusalem, the Catho lic Church would and cosld hold gen eral councils. On this head the sermon says "the Apostles have left no success ors." Here then is a difficulty. The Apostolic Council of Jerusalem pasted a law forbidding Christians to eat "strangled meat or blood." That law does not bind Dew. Who abolished it T No power inferior to that of the Apostles couUi annul their decree. Who authorizes ns now to eat r?re beefsteaks and blooV. puddings if thwe is no Apostolic power in the Chnrch te dispense from the ordi nanance of the;Apostolic synod of Jeru salem^ ? ? -? ThtpfiesU ami laity are not represent/ A in General Councils. Answer: The Vni verse, a Catholic journal of Paris, in its iseue of November 21, gives a list of three hundred and strenty priests and lay men and others not exercising episcopal jurisdiction who will assist at the delib erations of the approaching Council. Some of the cmdinaJs who will be most influential in ilare only priests. Cardi nal Barnabo, head of the Propaganda, i? only a prieet; Cardinal AntoneM is only a deacon. The sermon contradicts itself. It sayi that there were at the opening of the Council of Trent "fire generals of orders and the imperial com-, tuisuonert." These were not bishop9. The sermon contradicts itself again. It says that the first eight councils "were convoked by Che emperen" that all but two of them "were presided over by tha emperor or hi* commissioners;'' and that the decrees of the first three "were rati fied by the Bame civil dignitary." Surely this is lay representation with a ven geance. How then can it be trae that "no mere priest can sit in a General Council and that the brethren have no voice there f The council it not general because Prot estants and Greek schismatics xcill nol be represented in it. Answer: Was the la te General Assembly of Presbyterians de fective became the Episcopalians and Catholics wefo not represented there f General wilt does not represent the chief executive power of the United States, becaMe a million of a powerful minority voted against him. All the laws of the fJnited States made during tbe war wen invalid, because the se cessionist1! W?re not represented in Con gress. SucMh the logio of the sermon. The Reformation was an unjustifiable religious Jkcession. The Catholic 1 Church will admit her rebellious chil dren to citiaeuship if they agree to take tbe oath of allegiance. By a very re cent lettered the Pope to Archbishop Manning, ^lblisbed in last week's Catholic Minor, full opportunities are afforded to Protestants to present their views and objections to the Council. This letter ia later than tbe one alluded to in the sermon. The Pope is polite. He invites bis disobedient children to listen to him. The Presbyturiaus are not courteous. The Catholics feel quite hurt that they were not invited to the funeral of tbe Old and New School in the late General Assembly ! There is no liberty of discussion in the Catholic Church or in general councils. Answer: The history of the Couucil ot Trent is on< ot continual discussion. On last Thanksgiving Day Rev. Henry Ward Baecher, one of the ablest Prot estant Ministers in tbe conntry, said that the Catholic Church was like " a tenement house, there were so many families in it, always quarreling and disputing." Tbe sermon was reported i a the Tribute. Whom are we to believe, Brother Ftsner or Brother Beecher 1 The Pope's syllabus is opposed to liberty of conscience and a free press. Answer: The Pope is opposed to that liberty of the press which is more properly called licentiousness. The Pope, like all good Christians, does not wish papers like the 1'olice Gazette and the Day's Doings to circulate in families. I'lie syllabus is opposed to works like Edgar's " Variations," which contains a lie and a calumny on every page. Did uot tbe government of our own Republic sup press newspapers when tiiey became dangerous to the commonwealth T Yet we have freedom, and even licentious ness, of tbe press. Tho syllabus is op posed to that liberty ot conscience which wants polygamy and socialism. So is our government and all good Chris tians. The syllabus condemns the separation of Church and Stale. Answer: Tho Pope condemns the separation of religion and civil society. So do all Presbyterians. The Catholic Church would condemn to morrow any niaa who would teaclV that the separation between Churcli and Stato, as existing here, is contrary to divine or ecclesiastical law. Ho she condemns those in Europe who teach that the union of Church and Statu in seme Christian countries is contrary to revelation, or to divine or ecclesiastical law. She must live with all forms of civil government, for she is Calholio. This accusation against the Church comes with bad grace from a disciple of the Kirk by law established in Scotland, or a sou of the persecuting religions dictator of Geneva. The Catholics art opposed to public schools. Answer: The Catholics are opposed to infidel schools, but not to public t duration . Catholics hold that religion is at least of aa much impor tance to the child aa aritbnetio, spell ing and grammar. Five millions of Catholics are taxed in theUnited States for the support of schools to which they eannot conscientiously send their chil dren. Thus the poor boys of oar paro chial schools can point their finger at the well dressed common school chil dren and say, "our poor parents edu cate those fallows, while their rloh fathers pay nothing for ns." Is this fair? Is it flattering to noa-Uatholic self respect 1 ' The Catholic Church is opposed to the nineteenth century. Answer: The Catho lic Chorcb is the most lire religion in existence; witnew its progress, the zeal and activity of its members in the Uni- 1 ted States and even in the cfty of Wheeling. Witness the General Council which is going to be the largest and the grandest ever held. Over twelve hun dred representatives of the Catholio Church will assemble next Wodtxwday in the Vatican at Rome and teach the nineteenth century its duties. There | never was a more learned amenably in the world or one mote up to tbe spirit of the age. Now I conclude If tbe gloomy and terrific dogma of John Calvin be true, that even anrepeoian; murderers, adul terers and ro^nes are predestined to heaven; while tbe beet and holiest men without their fault may be doomed to. hell; tboo Mr. Fisher most have been jfo^'tdaiued to logical, tUeolOgieal, his | toncal and literary damnation. ilKXHT A.
