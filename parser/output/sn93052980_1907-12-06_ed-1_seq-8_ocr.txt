Local Editorial Page. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's message to congress is one of the longest and most interesting documents ever submitted to the national legislature. It sets forth in clear terms the ideas of one of the most positive, ablest and aggressive men that have ever filled the presidential office, covering the entire field of vital questions now before the people. For a number of years past these messages have been growing in length, owing" to the argumentative [style which has been of late introduced into their make-up. It is not enough nowadays to state the policies recommended, but the reasons are given why they should be adopted- While there is no indication' of a back down from the path of enforcing the law known as the inter state commence act against the powerful corporations which have heretofore never felt the controling force of the law, the document partakes of a conciliatory and conservative rather than a radical tone. Amendments are recommended for the purpose of dealing fairly and generously with the giant cor porations which are part and parcel of our national life. Still the position is strenuously maintained that the govern ment must exercise such control over these vast concerns as will insure the best interests of the commonwealth. Among other things the president recommends: A revision of the banking laws, and a more elastic cur rency. Income and inheritance taxes as a means of reducing over grown fortunes. A limitation of courts in the issuance of writs of injunction. Compensation for accidents to workmen in federal employ, and the extension of the eight-hour law. The compulsory submission of labor' disputes to arbitra- The establishment of the postal savings banks. That the products of child labor should be barred from entering inter-state commerce. A revision of the tariff is not recommended at/ this session, on the ground that the time is too short to permit of such an undertaking, and also that it would be inadisable to attempt . . / . ■ ■ ..-■.. - : : *■■••'■ • ■ ,~~ '■ i r ~~~^~ T ~~T~~~^ ~~ ~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ■ \ ■ tit.
