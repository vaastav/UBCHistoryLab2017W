arovernroent to comply witb its obliga tions under the metrical convention. Our friendly relations with the German empire continue without interruption. At the recent international exhibition of iish and fisheries at Herlin the participa tion of the United States, notwithstand ing the haste w ith which the commission was forced to make its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitors numeious awards of a high class, and for the coun try at large the principal prize of honor offered bv his majesty, the emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. ' There Iwe been some questions raised between the two governments as to the proper elTect and interpretation of our treaties of naturali zation, but recent dispatches from our minister at Herlin show that favorable progress is making toward an under standing in accordance with the views of this government, which makes and ad mits no distinction whatever between the rights of a native and naturalized citizen of the United States. In practice the complaints of molestation suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present. There is nothing of Importance to note in our unbroken fripndly relations with the governments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Sweden and Norway, Switzer land, Turkey and Greece. During the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine of this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, hoarded, and searched bv an armed cruiser of the .Spanish government. The circumstan ces, as reported, involve not only a pri vate injury to trie persons concerned, out also seemed too little observant to the friendly relations existing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is un dergoing investigation by the royal au thorities, with a view to such an explana tion or reparation as may be called for by the facts. The commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of our citizens against the government of Spain is, 1 hope, approaching the termination of its labors. The claims against the United States under thp Florida treatv with Spain were submitted to Congress for its action at the late session, and I again invite your attention to this long standing question, with a view to the tiual disposition of the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish t;ov rnmeiit a conference has recen'ly ieeu held at the city of Madrid tocoi'sider the subject of protection bv foreign powers of native Moors in the empire of Moroc co. The minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this conference, the re sult of which is a convention signed on behalf of all ttie powers represented. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The government of the United States has lost no opportu nity to urge upon that of the emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end to the persecutions which have been so prevalent in that country, of persons of a faith other than the Moslem, and especially of the lie- brew residents of Morocco. The consular treaty concluded with Uelgium has not yet been officially pro mulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed tor ratifi cation expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the period for ratification. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed on ac count of the objection of the Danish government to the usual clause provid ing that each nation should pay the ex penses of the arrest of the persons whose extradition it asks. The provision made by Congress, at its last session, lor the expense 01 me com mission which had been appointed to en ter upon negotiations with the imperial government of China, on subjects of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the commissioners to oroceed at once upon their mission. The imperial government was prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the conference proceeded with such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of November last, two treaties were signed at I'ekin,one relating to the introduction of Chinese into ttns country, aim one re lating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of the commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and it is ex pected that they will be received in sea son to be laid before the Senate early In Januarv. Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to again urge upon Congress the propriety of making provision for the erection of suitable lire-proof buildings at the Japan ese capitol for the use of the American legation, and the court-house and jail connected with it. The Japanese gov ernment, with great generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible piece of land. In tn last annual message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the indemnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I re new the recommendation then made, that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid, and the residue returned to the naiJons, respectively, to which they justly and equitably belong. The extradition treaty with the king dom of the Netherlands, which has been for some time m course of negotiation, has, during the past year, been concluded and duly ratified. Relations of friendship and amity have been established between the govern ment of the United States and that of Roumania. We have Bent a diplomatic representative to liucharist.and have re ceived at this capital a special envoy who has been charged by his Royal Highness, l'rince Charles, to announce the inde nendent sovereignty of Roumania. We hope for a speedy development of com mercial relations between the two coun tries In my last annual message I expressed hope that the prevalence of quiet on the border between this country and Mexico would soon become so assured as to jus tify the modication of the orders, then in force, to our military commanders, in re gard to crossing the frontier, without en couraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of both countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations, and the orders were ac cordingly withdrawn, to the entire satis faction of our own citizens and the Mex ican government. Subsequently the Eeace of the border was again disturbed y a savage foray, under the command of the Chief Victoria, but, by the com bined and harmonious action of the mil itary forces of both countries, his band has been broken up and substantially de stroyed. There is reason to believe that the ob stacles which have so long prevented rapid and convenient communication between the United States and Mexico by railways are on the pointof disappear ing, and that several important enter- wises of this character will soon be set on foot which can not fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of both coun tries. New envoys from Gautemala. Coluru bia, Uolivia, Venezuela and Nicarauga have recently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and enlightenment at ford the best guarantee of the contiuu ance of friendly relations between our selves and these sister republics. The relations between this government and that of the United States of Colom bia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by reason of the project of an inter-oceaniu canal across the isthmus of I'anama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Columbian government for that pur pose. The tieaty obligations subsisting between the United States and Colom bia, by which we guarantee the neutrali ty of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in the isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions un der which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effected transforming, as it would, this isthmus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, into a gate way and barrier between them, for the navies and merchant ships of the world should received the approval of this government as being compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the principal commercial power of the western hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special message to Con gress in March last, in relation to this subject, I deem it my duty again to press uuon votir attention. Substouent con sideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it is the right and duty or the Unit ed States to assert and maintain such su pervision and authority over any inter oceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our national interest." The war between the republic of Chili, on the one hand, and the allied re publics of Peru and Uolivia on the other, still continues. This government has not felt called upon to interfere in a contest that is within the belligerent rights of the parties as independent states. We have, however, always held ourselves in readi ness to aid in accommodating their dif ference, and have at different times re minded both belligerents of our willing ness to render such service. Our good oflices in this direction were recently accepted by the belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove ellica cious, but I regret to announce that the measures which the ministers ot the United stales at Santiago ami Lima were authorized to lake, with the view to bring about a peace, were not success ful. In the course of the war some ques tions have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all these the ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in pro tection of American interests. The relations of the United States with the empire of Jir-til continue to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to their mutual ad vantage. The internal disorders with which the Argentine Republic has for some lime past been aillicted, and which have more or less influenced its external trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may be expect ed to redound to the benefit of the for eign commerce of that Republic as well as to the development of its vast interior resources. In Samea, the government of King Malietoa, under the support and recog nition of the consular representatives of the United States, Great JJritain, ami Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquility to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite local gov ernment which has been proposed, the common interests of the three great treaty Powers require harmony in their relations to the native iranie or govern ment, and this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at .Apia were increased in extent and im portance so as to guard American inter ests in the surrounding and outlying is lands of Oceanica. The obelisk, generously presented by the Khedive of Egvpt to the city of New York, has arrived safely in this country, and will soon be erected in that metropo lis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this government, at the earnest solicitation of the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before Congress for its information. A commission for the re vision of the judicial code of the reform tribunal or Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman. Consul General, and J. M. liatchelder, Esq., have been ap pointed as commissioners to participate in this work. The organization of the reform tribunals will probably be contin ued for another period of live years. In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime states to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning the first of Jan uary. The acceptance of this invitation by many prominent Powers gives prom ise of success in this important measure, designed to establish a system of inter national notification by which the spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevent ed. The attention ot congress is invueu to the necessary appropriations for carry ing into effect the provisions of the act referred to. The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular ollicers, and through the dissemination of information ob tained from them, have been unrefaxed. The interest in these efforts, as devel oped in our commercial communities, and the value of the information secured by this means, to the trade and manu factures of the country, were recognized bv Congress at its last session, and pro vision was made tor the more frequent Eublicationof consularand other reports y the department of state. The first is sue of this publication has now been pre pared, and subsequent issues may regu larly be expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports of consu lar oflicers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all classes of mer chants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is.believed that the svstem of such publications is deserving of the approval of Congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continu ance and enlargement will commend it self to your consideration. The piosperous energies of our domes tic industries, and their immense produc tion of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even require, an active devel opment of the wishes and interests of our people in that direction. Especially important is it that our commercial rela tions with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico 6hould be direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East Indies, with Australia and the island groups which lie along the routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own Bhipping, uud to administer by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade, whatever modifications of our reg ulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of our carrying trade, 1 am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to be so clearly useful and eflicient. that I venture to press it upon vour earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular steam postal communication, by aid from government, has been the fore runner of the commercial predominance of Great Rritain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the desire and the intent of our peo ple. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with Great liritaiu for a share of this commerce fiave been successful in pro portion with their adoption of regular steam-postal communication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mex ico and the states of South America are anxious to receive such postal communi cations with this country, and to aid in their development. Similar co-operation may be looked for, in due time, from the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is dilllcult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In respect of foreign com merce, (mite as much as in internal trade, postal pomnninicatlon seems necessarily a matter of common and public adminis tration, and thus pertaining to govern ment. 1 respectfully recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as mav conduce to the develop ment of our foreign commercial ex changes and the building up of our car rying trade. In this connection I desire also to sug gest the very great service which might ue expecieu in enlarging anuiacuuaung our commerce on the Pacific ocean were a transmarine cable laid from San Fran cisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north, and Australia at the south. The great influence of such means of communication on these routes of navigation, in developing and secur ing the due share of our Pacific coast in the commerce of the world, needs no il lustration or enforcement. It may be that such an enterprise, useful, and in the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may need to be ac celerated by prudent legislation by Con gress in its aid. and 1 submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additionl. and not unimportant, al though secondary, reasou for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable service to the expan sion of our commerce, which would be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of the prop er construction and equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in case of maritime war, might be made constant and active agents in time of peace m the advance ment and protection of our foreign trade, and in the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would, naturally, in some numbers, mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an act ive movement of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval ollicers in promoting every interest of their countrymen, is a just subject of national pride. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the pres ent financial condition of the United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit,growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our resourc es, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any other coun try at any period of its history. All our industries are thriving; the rate of inter est is low; new railroads are being con structed; a vast immigration is increas ing our population, capital and labor; new enterprises in great number are in progress; and our commercial relations with other nations are improving.
