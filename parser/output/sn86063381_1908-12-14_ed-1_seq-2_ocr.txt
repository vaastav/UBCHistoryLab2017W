SUBSCRIPTI0N-$5.00 PER ANNUM MAIL ORDER COMPETITION. It is safe to say that any merchant who goes energetically about it can win back a lot of the mail order trade of his community to his store. The trouble is that so many merchants make the mistake of spending their time "knocking" mail order competition, instead of "boosting" their own business. They forget that "you can catch more flies with sugar." Arguing that a catalogue house customer is not a good citizen, heaping abuse on the mail order houses, telling people that they get cheated most of the times they buy by mail, doesn't count for much in the long run. The thing for the dealer in this community to do is to tell his trade what good merchandise they can buy in the store how far a little money will go for reliable merchandise in his store that their credit is good, if he does a credit business that they can see what they buy and pay for it when they get it, and not buy without seeing what they're getting and paying for it a week in advance that they can get what they want when they want it, without waiting a week or two for it to come by mail or express. The dealer who carries the best goods he can find, sells them at the lowest margin of profit that is reasonable, advertises effectively,and gives careful attention to the innum erable ways open to him of attract ing and holding trade will have little to fear so far as mail order compe tition is concerned. Large Thumbs. "People of great strength of charac ter, who are guided by the head rather than the heart, have large thumbs," says Irving R. Bacon. "Whenever you see a person with a strikingly large, well developed thumb, you may be al most certain you have before you one who is a natural born ruler, eminently practical and fond of whatever is use ful. Wherefore also he is fond of his tory. A large thumbed woman may fall in love as deeply as her small thumbed sister, but will not marry un less she can see a sufficient bread and butter supply ahead But she is more apt to be a real helpmate when adver Blty comes."New York Journal.

RESOLUTION CITESWRONGS Mr. Perkins (N. Y.), in Urging Its Adoption, Declares Some of the President's Expressions Are Unfor- tunateDisregard of the Matter, He Says, Would Be a Lack of Proper Self-Respect. Washington, Dec. 1?Immediately after the convening of the house Rep resentative Perkins of New York in troduced a resolution which had here tofore been agreed upon providing for the appointment of a special commit tee of five members to consider the proper means of dealing with that portion of the president's message which criticises the course of con gress in prohibiting the detail of secret service men to duty outside of their own bureau. The resolution is preceded by a preamble reciting some expressions of the message. No effort is made to give voice to the feeling of the house. In presenting the resolu tion Mr. Perkms made a brief state ment, saying that he was satisfied that the house would not hesitate to take such action as the dignity of that body required. He said that some of the president's expressions were un fortunate. The resolution was adopted and Messrs. Perkins (N. Y.), Denby (Mich.'*, Weeks (Mass), Williams (Miss) and Lloyd (Mo.) were ap pointed on the committee In submitting the resolutions Mr. Perkins said that the statements by the president could not be lightly dis regarded, as they might impair the usefulness of the congress that un due obtuseness might argue a lack of proper self-respect. Republican senators considered what action should be taken by the senate concerning the message of the president and it was practically de cided to permit the resolution to be brought in by some Democratic sen ator. The resolution will provide for an Investigation of the whole subject by the senate committee on appropri ations. HAS

Chicago, Dec. 1 .A well groomed man with just a tinge of gray in his hair and of distinguished appearance addressed about 150 people at St. Mary's hall, Bvanston, on "The Crime of Society in Dealing With the Crim- inal." It was Pat Crowe, turned evan gelist. The kidnapper of Eddie Cudahy seemed at ease on the platform and PAT CROWE. said his little piece well, although at times he forgot some sections, and, by being compelled to skip to the next one he remembered, he did not add to the logical continuity of the theme. He did not attempt to be oratorical, although at times he rose to the occa sion and sent a few hot shots into the camp of the enemy, which, in this case, was "demon rum."

"I had a nice farm in Oklahoma and was doing well when I believed I was called," he continued. "Now I have no money, my children have left me and I have murdered innocent men." Sharp professed to have received a revelation from God to preach and he had said that he believed the Lord would protect him and his flock from harm at the hands of their enemies, in which manner he spoke of the po lice.
