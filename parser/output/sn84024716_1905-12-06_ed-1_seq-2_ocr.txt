No unusual incidents marked the opening at noon,although a crowd ot' visitors was attracted to Wash? ington for the ooeaeion. The session of the Senate was brief, but that of tbe House lasted for several hours. Great interest attached to tbe House proceedings from tbe fact that a Speaker bad to be elected, and it was a foregone conclusion that Speaker Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois, would be re? elected without opposition, and he was. On account of pending matters of commewial and political Interest the present session of Congress bas been looked forward to as one of more than ordinary interest.

EDUCATORS IN LYNCHBUHO Th Co operative Education Association of Virginia held an interesting and helpful convention in Lynchburg on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week. The attendance was large, more than four hundred educators, in? cluding college presidentSjteacbers and superintendents, being pres? ent. Many practical addressee were made, which were followed by interesting discussions. Resolutions were adopted calling on the Gereral Aesembly for the establishment of a fund of $200, 000 as a building fund to be loaned to the counties and cities for ap? propriations in addition to the present educational fund, and ask? ing that steps be taken for the establishment bv tbe State of an institution cf higher learning whereby Virginia's daughters shall have the same opportunities as are now given her sons at tbe Univer? sity of Virginia. Dr. S. C. Mitchell cf Richmond College, was elected president of the Association, and Dr. George H. Denny of Washington and Lee, was made a member of the execu live committee. President Roosevelt's message In Ccngre&s was reud Tuesday before that body, and was listened to with great interest. Tbe message is voluminous, making more than half a hundred pages of closely printed pamphlet. Matters of in? terest to tbe government are dis? cussed interestingly, and many re? commendations are made for Con? gress to net upon. Tbe keynote of tbe message is struok wben the President says that this govern? ment is not and never shall be government by a plutocracy. Thie government is not and nevor shall be government by a mob. It shall continue to be in the ^future what it bas been in tbe past, a govern ment based cn the theory that each man, rich or poor, is to be treated simply and solely on his worth us p iran. The Democratic leader cf the House of Representative, Hon. John Steward Williams of Missis? sippi, bas informed Representative Claude A. Swanson that under no circumstances would a Virginian be selected to succeed Mr. Swan eon oa the W*-ys and Me-ns Co rn n,ittee. It i.< said Mr. Williams' attitude is due to his dislike for ReprefentaiiveHay cf the Seventh DiHtrict. The Virginia dele^atitn is not at all pleased with the at? titude of Mr. Williams. The Harrisonburg Spirt of tbe Vaiby last week published an industrial edition in magazine form,which gave excellent sketches of the enterprising business firms cf that progressive town. The issue was tastefully printed with exoellent half tone cuts. The Spirit is to be congratulated on its commendable enterprise. The President Endorsee James? town Tercentennial The following paragraph in President Rooaevel t's - message to Congress has reference to tbe Jamestown Exposition, in which be heartily endorses the move? ment: I heartily commend to your favorable consideration tbe ter? centennial celebration of tha settlement at Jamestown, Va. Appreciating the desirability of tbis commemoration, the Congress passed an act March 8, 1905, authorizing in the year 1907, on and near the waters of Hampton Roads, in the State of Virginia, an international naval, marine and military celebration in honor ol tbis event. By the authority vested in me by this act I hav mada proclamation of said celebration, and have issued, in conformity witb its instructions, invitations to all nations of the earth to participate by sending t.ieir uaval vessels and such military organiza? tions as may be practicable. This celebration would fail of its full purpose unless it were enduring in its results and con*nensurate with the importance of the event to be celebrated, the event from whi'-h our nation dates it birth. I earnestly hope that this cele? bration, already endorsed by the Congress of the Uuited States,and by the Legislatures ol f.ixteen States since tbe action cf the Con? gress, will receive such additional aid at your hands at- will make it werthy of tbe great event it is intended to celebrate, and thereby enable the government of the United States to make provision for the exhibition of its own resources, and likewise enable our people who have undertaken the work of such a celebration to provide suitable and proper en? tertainment and instruction in the* historic events of our country for) ali who may visit tbe exposition and to whom we have tendered our hospitality.
