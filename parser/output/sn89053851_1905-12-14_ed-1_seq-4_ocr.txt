tinues to flow into the Saltón Sea SALTON SEA AND IMPERIAL COUNTRY. An Interesting Array of Facts by One Competent to Speak. The unusual rise In the Colorado river at this time, and the failure of the engineers to stop the flow of that stream into the Imperial canal in take, has aroused new interest and new speculation concerning- the Sal ton Sea and the possible fate of the rich farming section known as the Imperial valley. Sometime ago En gineer George Y. Wisner, of the reclamation service, was widely quoted in the newspapers in this matter and he was interviewed upon the subject by a Republican reporter: The Saltón . basin and Imperial country, says Mr. Wisner, was origi i ji -i i . nany Deyonu a aouot part oi trie Gulf of California. The Colorado river began the formation of a delta or sand beds along its west bank and these were gradually added to until the Imperial country was formed, the Saltón Sea being the part of the gulf that was cut off. As this new land oa the west was formed the river gradually bore to the left, cutting the channel to the gulf now recog nized as its natural bed. The Saltón sink being cut off from any great supply of water gradually evapor Uted, leaving in its bottom a vast amount of salt which deposit was ad ded to by the washing of the salt left on its sides, down into the basin, by the action of rains and torrential streams. The matter of elevations is the next thing to consider. The water service of the Saltón Sea, that is the -water level, at the pres ent time is about 2G0 feet below sea level. Imperial, on the canal, which is now carrying almost the entire Colorado river, is about sixty feet below sea level, and the canal head, is 100 feet above sea level. Imperial, therefore is 160 feet lower than the intake, though yet 200 feet above the water service of the Saltón Sea. It is estimated that it might take the river ten or twelve years, perhaps longer, depending on the annual pre cipitation in the southwest, to ulti mately fill the sink to a point ap proaching sea level, but fill it is bound to do unless prevented by the enterprise of human agency. The certainty of this result can be under stood by the fact that the fall from the intake south to the gulf through the hitherto established bed of the river? So great is this difference that the service level in the canal just below the intake is five feet lower than the old bed of the river at a point just below the intake, and which latter channel was dry when Mr. Wisner visited the place in August. It should be stated here that just below the intake is an is land in the old bed and the channel above referred to is the one between the island and the California side At tnat time tnere was ouly a very few inches of water runninir throu-rh the channel on the eastern side of the island, a flow one could easily roll up his pants and wade across Since then, newspaper reports have stated that this channel was almost as dry as the other, at least until the recent flood. When Mr. Wisner visited Yuma last August he found 8500 second feet of water flowing by that city, just aoout tne same volume that was flowing there one year before. But he was somewhat startled to discover that the bed of the river- was two feet lower at Yuma than it was the year before. The natural conclusion is that the current caused by the rush into the intake below had already scraped two feet off the bottom of the river as far up as Yuma, twelve miles above the intake. With a fall of 100 feet between the intake and Im perial, and a still greater fall be tween that point and the Saltón Sea, one can scarcely appreciate what the old river may do in a few years in the way of digging out its own bot tom in the vicinity of Yuma. The suggestion has been made by some one that even if the'river con the evaporation will equal its vol ume. Figures again prove the con trary. The area of the Saltón sink at sea level is about 1,000,000 acres. The annual evaporation in those parts is about eight feet of water or a total for the entire area of 8,000, 000 acre feet. Against that the an nual average discharge of the Colo rado river is 11,000,000 acre feet. There would then be an annual gain of 3,000,000 acre feet over any possi ble evaporation. In respect of how to prevent what seems at first thought to be the in evitable, there are two or three pro jects under way that will certainly prove of great benefit and many oth ers may be devised before there is wide disaster. Of those assured Mr. Wisner makes particular mention of the Laguna project. When that is completed and thousands of acres be low it are brought under cultivation a vast amount of this water will be utilized. When the Roosevelt dam is completed a very large part of the water of the Gila river, one of the Colorado's main tributariis, will never get as far as Yuma. There are other storage projects contem plated on the tributaries of the Colorado that will further lessen its volume and what may be the fruits of further study on the part of engineers no one can tell. The situa tion therefore, is not all black for the Imperial country and there may be yet many ways of preventing the thing that would result disastrously were nature left to her own devices. It is the judgment of those posted, that this is only a repition of geologi cal history. There is a legend among the Indians of Southern California that this same filling of the sink oc curred about ai long ago as the lives of four old men by which one might arrive at about 350 years ago. Mr. Wisner says that on the inclined plain or shore of the present Saltón sink have been found three fresh water beaches; that is three beaches believed to have been formed bv fresh water for the reason that the shells found there are the same as found in fresh water. This suggests three inundations before the present ce. The theory is that when the river fills the sink to water level or so high the current ceases, it begins to form bars across its own pathway just as the Imperial country was originally formed, then gradually throws its current to the east finding a more rapidly receding elevation to ward the sea through what is now the old river bed. Then when that is filled by bars or some artificial or other channel cuts in again from the west as it did in the construction of the Imperial conal, it again turns its face to the westward with the Saltón sea for its destination. The move ments of the river are of more than passing interest to engineers for that it is the ouly big river that within the memory of the present genera tion has literally taken up its bed and walked without at least scatter ing a few of the blankets. Republi can. The Presidential Stroke. The recommendation of President Roosevelt in regard to the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as one state has not come to The Republi can as a surprise, though there is an unreasonable bluntness in it which was not expected. The paper has long been aware that the president favored joint statehood, if indeed he was not the first to, suggest it as a solution of the vexing statehood problem. Nearly two years ago former Dele- gate Rodey, of New Mexico, made the public statement that President Roosevelt told him that he was in favor of jointure and this statement though repeatedly made was never denied by the president orby any one qualified to speak for him. The ques tion was brought up at a territorial convention held at Tucson for the purpose of selecting delegates to the republican national convention of 1904. Governor Brodie, a member of the convention denied that those were the views of the president, and he sent -a telegram to him requesting him to support the denial. That telegram was never answered. In however high respect the presi dent may be held, his opinions on the subject of statehood will be treated here with no respect at all, nor will his frequent advocacy of the "square deal" so often reiterated as to have become commonplace, be understood to have any application to Arizona. It cannot be urged by his friends in this part of the world that his recom menoation is tne expression ot an honest but mistaken opinion. The president has had the subject laid be fore him by impartial investigators of conditions in the territory by men who had no material interest in Ari zona, and they left him with the con clusion that the president had been impressed with the truth of their re ports. Besides, if this information had not been brought to him it might have been presumed that he would have sought the fullest knowledge of conditions before launching that characteristically, dictatorial recom mendation for the commission of .the most fragrant political outrage ever attempted or proposed in this course Congress according to the terms of the recommendation of President Roosevelt is relieved of the task of deliberation. "There is," says he, "no justification for further delay and the advisability of making the has four territories into two states been clearly established." By whom, we may ask? By Bev eridge, whose report was the most dishonestly framed document ever presented to congress. By the argu ments of Beveridge, whose remarks on the omnibus bill and the Hamilton bill were characterized by rancor and bitterness toward the territories. All of the. many recommendations, save this one, of the president's un usually voluminous message, are fol lowed by reasons more or less prolix, for their making. But no reason is assigned this one except "Nothing has taken up more time in congress during the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four territories." The reasoning of Mr. Roosevelt is lacking in that enforced justice of the unjust judge, who righted the wrongs of the importunate widow: Yet because this widow tmubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual cominsr she wearv me." President Roosevelt wearied by the importunate appeal of Arizona for the rights of statehood nronosps to prevent a repetition of that appeal for all time by the consignment of the territory to perpetual servitude and by blasting the hopes forever of those who for a generation have ooked hopefully forward to inde pendent statehood. There are no obligations on us," says Mr. Roosevelt in regard to anv claims which" the rights of the terri tories may have upon the. respect of himself and the congress. That is true, there are no binding constitu tional obligations but there Í3 a cer tain morality which the president, habitual moralizer as he is, has quite overlooked. Since his incumbency he has with a frequency amounting to a habit, been engaging in duties whose performace was not forced upon him by any legal obligation and in none of them have right and jus tice been more deeply involved than in that neglected duty of saving this territory from the ruin of jointure or of at least in keeping his hand off. We have been authoritatively in formed that the president has had no deep intense interest of the mat ter but that before he knew as much of the question as he afterwards learned, he had promised Senator Beveridge his support in the coming struggle, and that he admitted that but for that promise he would keep silent. Here is a presentation of weakness wholly out of keeping with the popular conception of President Roosevelt. The president has never entertained a sincere friendship for the west. He has patted it on the back and led it into confounding patron izing familiarity with friendly inter est. The mental attitude of Mr. Roosevelt toward the population of the west is hardly less contemptuous than that of former President Cleve land and is well illustrated by the following extract from a recent let ter by Mr. W. E. Curtis: "Arizona is the range of the Rough Rider and the people of the territory are complaining that they are 'rough ridden.' Going into the president's office one day last winter, I found Major Llewellyn of the first volun teers, seated on a sofa. When I ask ed what he was doing in Washington he explained that he had come to ar range an escort of Rough Riders for the president on inaugural day. "Are you going to haye all the regiment here?" I asked. "The president who stood five or six feet awy, talking with another caller, must have overheard our re marks, for he turned and, showing his teeth, whispered: " 'All who are not in office or in jail." There is nothing to be expected from an appeal to President Roose velt's sense of justice in this matter. The whole reliance of Arizona must be placed upon congress. The battle is by no means lost. President Roosevelt's recommendations have been frequently ignored. We trust that this one will be disregarded. Kepublican. King of all Cough Medicines- Mr. E. G.
