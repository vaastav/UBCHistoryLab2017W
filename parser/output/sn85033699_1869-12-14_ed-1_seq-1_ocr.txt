Tho general question to be considered was, whether or not the tax of 10 per cent on State Banks, or National Ranks paying out notos of individual or State Banks used for circulation, is repugnant to the Constitu tion. The Chief Justice in his opinion, said : This question cannot be determined by tho Court The judicial cannot prescribe to the legislative department ol the govern ment limitations on tho exercise of ac knowledged powers. Th6 responsibility of legislation is not to the court, but to tho people having, in the exerciso of consti tutional power, undertaken to provido a currency for the whole country. It can't be questioned that Congress may constitu tionally secure the benefit of it to tho pul lic by appropriate legislation. To this end Congress has denied tho quality of legal tender to foreign coins and has provided by law against impositions of counterfeit and base coin upon the community. To tho sarao end Congress may discourage, by ! xuitablo enactment, the circnlation, as money, of any notes not issued under its own authority. Without this power, in deed, its attempt to secure grand and uniform currency, for the country must be futile vicwod in this light as well as in the other. Ab duty on contracts or property, we cannot doubt tho consistency of tho tax under consideration. The three questions certified from the Circuit Court of the district of Maine must, therefore, be an swered allinuativclj. The questions are, first, whether the second clause of the 9th action of the act of Congress of July, 1GG, tiader which the tax was collecred, is a valid and constitutional law. Tho other two questions were differently in form. t V i f NASHVILLE UNION AND AMERICAN. ESTABLISHED MARCH 30, 1835,, NASHVILLE, TENN., TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1869. NEW SERIES, NO. 403.

New Yons, "Dec 13. A bogus firm under the title of W. H. H. Stewart fe Sons, lo cated in Bridgeport, Conn., has, during the past six weeks, successfully swindled a large number of merchants at the West and Pennsylvania, by soliciting and receiv ing consignments of produce, which have been shipped to unknown places. An in vestigation by a Pennsylvania merchant discovered the swindle, and over 10,000 wortii ot Hour, butter, etc., were round at tho steamboat freight dertot in Bridseoort. No trace of the swindlers has been obtained. They used the names of many well-known New York and other merchants as refer ences, besides referring to an Empire Na tional Bank of this city, no such bank ex isting. Extensive Forcing-, Stealing or "ItnUln?." New Yobk, Dec 13. Thore havo been rumors since Saturday on Wall street of ir regularities of certain securities hypotheca ted with prominent brokers which, it is sup posed, have been either forged or stolen. It appears bonds of Sl.000 each have been directly altered to $10,000, and with, other certificates of registered government stocks supposed to have been stolen, have been used as collateral security to secure about 8500.000. The firm said to be implicated is W. E. Gray & Co., who havo been doing business for the last mourn at 44 imane street. Tho firm consists of Mr. Gray and . C. Pratt Son or iv United States Chaplain. Gray was formerly of Washington, and is tho son of the Chaplain of the United States Senate. Pratt is reported to be the person who purchased the Sl,000 bonds which were subsequently altered to $10,- 000. A few months ago Jay Cooke & Co., purchased some bonds which they subse quently learned had been stolen a year aro from E. J. Yoolsey. The bonds were tracod back to Gray, who redeemed them and the matter was allowed to rest. Over S250,OO0. Tho alterations in bounty, loan, stock and registered government bonds as far as discovered, exceed $250,000, and it is likely tho frauds are to a still greater ex tent, as now cases aro being constantly reported. Some of the altored certificates were exceedingly well executed, and others very poorly done. On Friday the Bank of Commonwealth discovered they had throo altered bounty and loan certificates, and immediately sent for Mr. Gray when the bank was made good. The officers, however, considered itlheir duty to notify the Manhattan Company and officers of the company and Gray were brought face to face. Gray staled that he bought the bounty loan certificates through a man named Pratt He believod the par ty altering them was Blackwell, and also that he had a detective on his track. The conference between the officers of the Man hattan Company and tho Bank of Common wealth and Gray lasted until G r. m. Fri day. No steps were taken to arrest Gray, as he protested his innocenco and threw the whole thing on Blackwell. On Saturday Gray again made his ap pearance on the street and borrowed somo additional amounts of money and moro altered certificates, including S-0,000 from tho Mechanics' Bank. Many parties on the street had suffered by tho operations of Gray & Co., in amounts ranging from $1'0,CMMI to 65,000. A reward of S.",000 has been offered for the apprehension of Gray and Pr itt, and the other members of the firm wh have been missing since Saturday. IRELAND. The English Cabinet Scared. LoNtoN-.

On motion of Mr. Speaker Perkins, tho bill to relieve tho State Treasury was made the special order after tho Railroad bill was disposed of. Mr. Kenney moved the previous nncs- tion on tho passage of the railroad bin, but withdrew it at the suggestion of Mr. Flom- ng. Mr. White in a few remarks opposed the bill, claiming that it callod for extraordina ry privileges and franchises which no State should guaranty without first making pro vision for retaining some control over the road. Mr. Neil artmcd against tho passace of tee bill. He was satisfied it would bo fatal to the prospects of our own local roads; go ing to bmld up tho intorests and commer cial importance of Cincinnati at the ex pense of Tennessee. Mr. Russell, of Rutherford and Bedford. proposed as an amendmont an additional section, which provides that the State of Tennessoe shall havo five truscees of tho road, and who 6hall havo equal power with said trustees in tho management of the road within the limits of Tennessee. Mr. James, of Hamilton, opposod the amendment, claiming that until Tennesseo furnished $10,000,000, as Cincinnati had done, it was preposterous to claim equal control in the road. Ho moved to lay tho amendment on the table carried; aves. 3fi; noes, 27. Mr. Rhea offered an amendment provid ing that the Governor shall nominate as trustees three porsons living along the line of the road, to bo confirmed by the Senate, who shall represent the interests of the State and see that the rights of tho road aro not infringed or violated. Mr. V hito proposed an amendment that tho Stato of Tednossoo shall havo tho same logislativo control in this road that it holds in other railroads of tho Stato. Before cither of these amendments were acted on, Mr. flenung, in a speech of considerable length, opposed tho passage of the bill. lie vindicated the report of tho Judi ciary Committee against tho bill, as sub mitted by him on a previous day of the Bession. He insisted that, notwithstand ing the amendments that had boen offered by the faiends of the measure, the bill in all its essential features, was still the same when it camo from tho hands of the committee and subject to the ssmo objections. He argued at length to bhow that the con stitution of the State of Tennesseo docs not authorize the passage of such a bill, which asks that a foreign corporation, not subject to our Legislature, should be in vested with the sovereign right of emmont domain for tho good, not of Tennessoe, but of tho 'city of Cincinnati, whoso primary and solo object was the aggrandizement of her own wealth and importance at the gen eral internal improvement system of Tenne?83e. He argued that under the terms of the "Ferguson bill," which is but an evasion of the Constitution of Ohio, and under the provisions of this bill, neither Kentucky nor Tennessee ould share in the benefits of the enter prise, but, it carried out, must submit to au extensive anil oppressive monopoly, and that, loo, without one cent of tribute in return. He insisted that the clause which exempted the property of Cincinnati in Tennessee from taxation is in violation of the Con stitution, and that the Legislature has no power to enact it. If the Legislature had the power to pass the bill, for various considerations of pub lic policy, he contended such extraordinary' privileges should not now be granted. Ho argued that monopolies at best, and whon regulated by our own laws, aro dangerous to tho rights and prosperity ol a people, more especially so when in control of a powor foreign to tho State and competing with the interests of tho State. The provision that suits might be brought in our courts by servico of process npon any agent of the city or trustees, was only coneession calculated to doceive. bo long as tho entire road with all ifs append ages and property ot every description is mortgaged' initio to the Cincinnati bond holder, any recovery in our courts would be worthless, even could we get jurisdiction of the trustees by rucIi process. Under tho act of Congress, they might, as a foreign corporation, transfer any matter in con troversy to the rcdcral (Jourt, and any satisfaction ol any judgment when ob tained could only be had off the city of Cincinnati. Bring the absolute owner of the entire line through Tcnuesscc and Kentucky. Cincinnati could afford to pass all freight between Chattanooga and Cincinnati, to and fro, at the mere cost of limning the road, or even less, thereby se curingamouopoly of thctrade and the pros tration of all competing lines. Instead of thus contnbutin to the "public good of Tennessee, she would be enabled to crush out cveiy effort toward the erec tion of nianu factories and to paralyze the energies ol the State in the future development and realization of her own wealth. Instead of bcine our "benefactor,'- as has been claimed, Cin cinnati is seeking to turn our tempor ary poverty to her own emolument, and, having already ennched herself oil our liusioi tunes, is now asuing us in our supposed extremity to surrtmh 1 to her, without compensation, our hopes for lhc future. Our own railroad sys tem lias cost more than $G0,00O,uoi, aud our railroads are the ouly s-ccunty we have for the greater portion of our public debt. While the Legislature is now en gaged in devising plans to render these roads most prontauic in the retirement or payment of this debt, we nrc asked to strike a blow at the entire system, which will instantly impair the value of every important road in the State. Cincinnati ha3 persistently refused to make conncc tion with any Tennessee road, because sho desired the absolute control and benefit of the project for herself. He denied that he had ever asserted the constitutionality of such a bill as this. cither as editor of the Press and Herald or in any other capacity. He had urged upon Cincinnati the policy of meeting Tennessee at thetenninusof the Knoxvillc and Kentucky road, for flint would have vitalizcda line of road tha is now languish ing in its infancy forthorrason that Cincin nati had not kept her faith and met Tcnnes gee on the line. By meeting the Knoxvillc and Kentucky line, she would have had to uscof about ISOmiles of Tennessee road to reach the cotton States. By coming to Nashville, the Nashville and Chattanooga, Nashville and Decatur, and other roads, would have been benefitted. The same had she gone to McMinnvillc. She dc sired no such embarrassing connections. Sho wants the entire profits and absolute monopoly lo herself. Mr. Fleming dwelt al length upon other objections to the bill, and closed by warn ins members against being led by delusive promises into the support of a measure which was frought with mischief, if not ruin, to the commercial interests of the State. Mr, James of Hamilton, advocated the passace of the bill. He argued that the privileges claimed under this bill the right of way to a railroad through a State, had been granted time and again hereto- fore. Why should it be granted in this case, it local prejudice was not at tue liottom of the opposition ? He continued at some length to combat the constitution al objections urged by Mr. Fleming, quo ting from various laws and decisions, which he contended were in his fuvor. Before proceeding to a vote, tho House adjourned until 9 o'clock to-morrow. A VOICE FROM OLD WTLSON Tfegra Suffrage, and What of it To the Editors of tha Union and American : In its issue of Dec. 9, the Banner takes the people of Wilson and Shelby counties and many of the best and bravest citizens of the State to task in language which :.lo ' i -i it. i V , , uouui nny a suueu tue columns oi me new York Tribune, or one of the insane tirades of Wendell Phillips. Ether of those might have urged that there is no argument against negro suffrage hut "ignorant prejudice." They profess to believe in the natural and actual equality of men. But they have not yet taught the people of Now York tho dogma. If tho "ignorant prejudices" of the people of New Yorlcare not yet overcome, may wo not find somo slight excuse for tho "ignor ant prejudices" of the Southern people to whom negro suffrage appears a present and pressing degradation ? Can't the Banner ooncode that somo fow poor misguided mon, may, in their simplicity, find somo other argument satisfactory to them against ne gro suffrage, besides "ignorant prejudice f" Can't the Banner, by a great stretch of magnanimity, grant that there may possibly bo one of "the intellect and chivalry of Tennessee" who opposes this alarming in novation upon the forms and theories of government under which he was so unfor tunate as to be reared, without deserving the denunciation, in the choice language of theBanner, of being a "designing xcretch?" Is the Banner's estimate of chivalry so high that no gentleman can come up to its standard of "intellect and chivalry" with out embracing the negro as a "man and a brother?" Now, who proposes to take any "existing right," or "property right of franchise" from ine negro t uan uio f ourteenth or the Fifteenth Amendment to tho federal Constitution, adopted by an illegal and un constitutional number of States or by btates under dures3, give mm a right? (Jan the notoriously illegal and unconstitu tionaLaction of a tyrannical minority, by legislative usurpation, in our own State, confer upon him a right? Certainly not. Suppose ho has a right, or may hereafter acquire such right, under tho simple forms of law, by legal and constitutional amend ment of tho toderal or Stato constitution, must every man bo denounced as a "design ing wretch" who thinks the safety and honor of tho country require that lho bal lot should be taken from him ? Wo say, No; ex-cathedra, the Banner says, Yes. "An honest man's tho noblest work of God!" Eureka! at last! There is an in carnate "noblest work" in the Banner, and there is no honest man in tho whole State of Tennesseo who differs in opinion with this rare specimen for he has a con tempt for treachery. Treachery to what ? Oh, we have made pledges! But, pray have any of tho pledges, to which you refer, over been ac cepted by the negroes? Nay, verily! You "have piped unto them, but they havo not danced; ' moro than that, yon "havo mourned unto Utcm, but they have not lamented." They havo "mocked vs in our calamity"- and have voted dead solid against us overy time. "No taxation without representation" Alas for every femmc-sde, fold maid or widow) alien, idiot or lunatic in tho land ! Ehen! Alas! "Our Cxsar hath grown to great" that ho now cares nought for tho applause or approbation of poor whito men or in his elegant diction "the groundlings" (Why didn't ho say low meanjwhitcs at once?) In his effort to exalt the elegant colored gen tlemen ("who are not patrons of newspa pers orprinter's ink, "doubtless because they cant read even the names on the ballots which they cast) to a standard evidently higher in his estimation, than that of an honest, poor, white man who dares to differ with him upon this issue, he cer tainly forgets that the poor "groundling" unfortunately is the first to suffer from this mad attempt to establish the equality of the races. Again : should this conquered Ephr.nm cease to be joined to the idols which his white and frco fathers worshipped, and fall down and worship the black idol at whoso shrine the Banner bows, moro especially when Fpbraim is satisfied that he is right upon principle when he can't see the ultimate gain in bowing "the pregnant hinges of the kneo that thrift may follow fawning" when he, Ephriam, believes that all right is cxpedi . cnt aud all wrong is inexpedient ? On: lhe whip in the hands ot our Radical taskmasters" which can teach the honost and chivalric" lo treat a question grave from mere motives of expedi- ncy in a stylo which ho might not have elected it an original proposition. "Forced anlagoniun!" If tho negro votes, antagonism must surely follow; if not, tho white man ha3 not the least mo tive for antagonism, but every reason to protect him. Honest men and soldiers, Urate as any of "Tennessee s chivalry," may bo de nounced as demagogues, who indulge in 'clap-trap ; as "designing wretches, without ordinary capacity; without brains;' "with voicespitched to tho high est key-note on the gamut of ignorant prejudice :" but this certainly indicates jaundiced views inability, by fair argu ment, io maintain populous new mm strange ; new converts who aro over-zealous and aro in great dangor of falling away from the doctrines and maxims of their ingenuous youth before they learned- the meaning of expediency.

After a long and tiresome trip of just one week, I ar rived at this place to-day. The many persons to whom 1 had letters of introduction received me kindly. They bid me have patience, and say I will be sure to get business. Col. Brcnuam, lo whom Lol. Bane Payton gave me a letter, was very kind. He sat down immediately and wrote to Bernard Peyton, in Smith connty, request ing him to gel a connonauic posi tion for a Tcnnessecan "abroad. " Tho general complaint is, that times are harder here than ever uclore. 1 ten tnem thai is because of the completion of what you call the Pacific Railroad.

'flic rcnitcntiary VIiat Snail be Done with It J Tn ha FilitnTs of the Union 1 American: I desire to make a few suggestions and remarks on the subject of the peniten tiary. For nil the one, two and tnree year convictions, let the county in which they arc convicted saddle the expense 01 con viction. Let them build a jail sufficient for the security of convicts and prisoners. then hire an overseer and employ those short term convicts in improving the roads of the county, thus exposing them to their acquaintances, and increasing their shame. When a county has not convicts enough to iustifv working them under an over seer, let them loan or hire them to an au joining county, and thus rid the State of an enormous expense, of sending con victs to the penitentiary from tho four ouartcrs of tho State. Let the Legisla turc investigate the cost lo the State of one, two and three years convicts- and it may open their eyes. Not long since I was on the cars, and there were three convicts for theenitcn tiary and the usual amount of guards. casually asked the term of their sentence, and was told that two of them for one year and the other one a little longer. made inquiry of their crime, and learned wood stealing was the charge, and from all I could learn I thought it doubtful any of them were guilty. It is an easy matter to cry mad dog and arrest a man on mere suspicion, try him by a jury selected on purpose to convict him, so that a few favorites can guard him to the Penitentiary, and thus make visit to Nashville at the expense of the State. If nothing better can be done, would be well to make each county pay the ex penses of their own convicts and thus rid tho State ot one ot her great, taxesi Tax Payee.
