VOL. VI—NO. 872. THE TRIBULATIONS OF TIMOTHY TOMPKINS, ESI)., Who Relateth his Experience with SEWING- MACHINES. • lam not immaculate. 1 deny any particular Banc'ifica tion. I possess all the passions of an unrt gen.rate race. Though i am not especially anxious that my nature be changed, ytt I would like to have the affairs of this life so far modi lied as nr. t to'-all forth my atrocious character is tics, as circumstances last night did. But as I fe d more calm this morning,! wilichronicl • the facts, as a t'-rriblc warning to those who have faith in the machinations of modern inventors. My commiseration has be-.n often excited in behalf of Mrs. Tompkins, at seeing he**, from dawn to midnight, work- ; ing with her needle, because, with a sort tf mate nal pride, she felt that r.obady but herself was good enough to plan i and execute in the preparation of raiia-nt for our children But a fortnight since, a sight at her care-worn face sug gested the b illiant idea, that after all, her caprice m ght be gratified, r.nd that too without her having to perform the excessive phj sical labor whi h she was then <• during. That idea was to buy a Sewing Machine. Now I flitter myself that a noble irapul'O suggested that idea, and 1 instinctively assumed the perpendicular before the mirror, that I might gazi upon the counterfeit present ment of a philanthropist I thought 1 saw a rcrenc benig nity resting u- on my side whisker?; I fancied that a noble charity beamed from my spectacles; while my auburn hair (some persons irreverently call it red) jeemed tog : ow with the fervor of a Christian spirit engaged in noble work?. It was a foregone conclusion that 1 was to purchase a genuine shuttle sewing machine, with a sort o! "hookera snivy'' attachment to make a lock stit h, "one of the okl kind,biass mounted." Put not a word to >l.s. T-mpkins about it. I wanted her to be astonish d and gladdened. I went the next morning to an establishment where I saw sundry tewing machines; and I saw a beautiful fen ale gift-.-1 wiih pleasing manners operate upon them. She had blue eyes, and winning crinoline; a musical voice, and a persuasive netw rk about her hair, alluring teeth ard ex pi-: sive gaiter*; an attractive form and an eloquent em broidered ski: t and th way the made cloth travel through that machine was a caution to fingers. The needle kept punching holes through the cloth like a .nvende crowbar, and faster than the cbt.tt r of a little nigger's teeth in a:> equinoxial storm, and each punch made a stitch measured with mechanical exactness, amidst a licketty-ricketty whirl of the machinery that was highly suggestive to the uniniti ated of the old maxim, "Mustn't meddle with edge tools.'' Then seeing what a state of enlhu: iasm i ha t reached, she put in sonic fa'cy touch : 3, as a clincher. She made the ream into all sorts of curlikews, sn 1 finally capped the cl - max by sewing the Lor '.* Prayer, the Declaration of Inde pendenc . ni> t-.iin •• iu full, and .. pfcture of Adam and Eve in the Gar<".-. no: Eden, and the Stirs and Stripes, and all on a pi ce of cloth two inches square, at the sam-* time putting on an embroidered margin to give it effe t Thi last dodge settled the m ilt-r. I r • i the price,, / ndgave directions where to send the macbin . When I pre • nted it tu Mrs. Tompkins, as I expeclc-d, s' o was astonished. \r d not only astonished but electrified* though she was ufra.d she would never be able t > use it. However, after ivo or t.u days' p. icticc and a c!u:e read ing the direction?, she gol the hang of the contrivance, and in a week more had accomn idied sewing enough to load a cart, ar d that, too, wi .hout : ny coisunsption of midnight oil. But in th - in- amhae Mrs. Tompkins had been preparing a surprise forme. She bought a book called "Every Man hhs own Tailor.'' which gave explicit directions t the un skilled how to cut rut masculine toggery in accordance with the latest style, and guided by this book and a pair of inv pants. Mis. Tompkins slashed intoa piece cf cloth. She applied the sewing machine to the ruins, when, presto! a pair cf pants greeted her vi ion. A few touches of ffat ircn and - ompleted the structure, and that ni :ht i received tl e compliment of a pair of pantalor.es, the trium: h r f Mr?. Tompkins' genius. I wish o y vo,ly could have exj erienced xny feelings when Mrs. T. gae eme thox* pantaloons. 1i ad enough up on which lo pride myself in possessing li-r. I b d revelled in her smiles, I had watched her motherly care and guid ance of cur little ones. 1 knew that in times of adversity her affection had b-*- n a tower of strength upon which I had leaned, thai she had soothed niy sorrows, smeched my linen, and had ever been vigilant iu caring for my morals and buttons. It was a hapjy moment when I bought (hat sewing m-.uhinc that 1 might mollify the se verity of her cares, and ence mire st the bloom upon her cheek. But doubly was 1 gratified when, with woman's remembrance of little act* of kindnes*, she had hastened to show her r.ppre iation of the gifr. To be :;ur-, the panta loons were a little tight in the knee*; somewhat loose in the waist, a trifle 1< g in the hips, and rather short *a th" legs, a little full before, and scant behind, and the pockets were not easily accessible (which, as Mrs. T. ingeniously sug gested, make them pro f against pick-pockets), but aside from these slight defects, they certainly were admirable pants. But I come now to an cp sode in my sawing machine e: periencc which borders on the tragic. And I briefly an nounce to the world thai sewing machines are a mockery, a delusion and a sr. are. Fond hopes that my imagination had raised or. high, like a proud banner on th battle fi. Id, flaunting before the;enemy in the moment of expect ant victory, have been st icken down! Farewell to the cherished belief that the.-.igns of old tgc would keep aloof from Mrs Tom/kins' form and face, and she remain juve nescent, even when her ego should be measu;cd by scores of winters! All is gone! Let rae tell vou how it happened. lam not gifted with gigantic powers of mind that would fit me to achieve won ders at the hesd of marshaled forces amid the din of arm ; nor have 1 the c'nseic dignity of beating and rhetorical cul ture that would enable me to properly preside over the Board of Aldermen, were 1 a member of th it body; but there are some thugs 1 can do, and if I excel in anything it is in things saltatory. 1 can dance. Let the inspiring r. L of the violin greet my e ir, and * y a spontaneous impulse rheumatism is eliminated from this mortal frame, corns a -e j no longer a source of corporeal tribulation, and my limbs commence to i brnte responsive b> ihe cadences of tie rat gut. Of course then, these being the facts, when 1 was invited to attend with Mrs. ibtcpkins the annual ball of the John ' Smith Grenadi is, I accepted the invitation; cud of cour°v, too, it was decide d that Mrs. Tompkins* latest acbievt-nv at in masculine raiment was to honor the occasion. We did go, and wo did danc*. I did some big things in the Terpse chorean line, an i several times while .waning these mng nitudincus matters, I thought s mething was giving way in my exterior ringing; but as-i superficial glance at my wardrobe disclosed nothing in the way of a laceration or fracture I proceedvd with my gymnastics with faith un shaken in the permanency of my clothing. At last the Lancers came cn the progtamme. Now if there is anything in the saltatory vocal ulary that I like better than anything else, it is the Lancers. There is something in the figures tl at is calculated to draw out whatever physical graces a person posses cs- I flitter my self that I led off gayly nod rat -fully, and that the Lancers flattered itself that it was xtr mely fortunate '*n having me to exhibit itr b auti- s, ui> to the time when the lady end opposite gentleman for ward and salute each other, the latter by a bow. In tins figure I particularly ex-- 1, and as I approached the lady I made a graceful, but low and eve n reverential obtisan e But as my head reached the lowest point o? etiquette, 1 felt an abrupt giving way in my nether rigging, accompanied by a sudden rough grating sound like u to a quartette of rip-saws travelling up my pantaloons with a speed porten tous of a rapid dissolution of needlework. My legs sudden ly flt relieved from all external restrait t. 1 looked down upon the scene below with a sort of whirling sensation. Ye God*! what a bight! IV here was once a stunning pair of pantaloons, was now four scrips of cloth dauKling about my cl i.'sic b gs like black -treamcrs from a pirate's masthead in a calm. 1 made one convulsive jump, landed sixteen feet distant by the door, knocking an elderly female under a sofa on the way, and in fifteen seconds was in a carriage on my way horn , leaving Mrs. Tompkins to constitute a sec or.d lead. I stocd b.f'-rc the mirror and contemplated the- runs. I bad put my trust in sewing machines, and was deceived Henceforth, in despair, I turn my face against all modern improvements, and a'l such diabolical contrivances. I shall buy a horse and wagon, and never give cojntennnce to a railroad car. I shall dig a well in ray back yard; and with aw 11. sw.-ep and bucket supply myself with the re quisite fluids for family use, and cut cff communication with Jones* Fails. Tallow candles shall displace the ?a9 light of my domicile, and tr;e spirit of Old Fygyiam shall hold revel in my domain. 

TIMOTHY TOMPKINS. P. S Since writing th • ibove, bas.d upon further infor mation anl experience, I have rc? de l from the despairing views there aken. Mrs. Tompkins was terribly chagrined at the misfortune- n't n ling that pair r.f and in lier distress ?!• 4;i 1 to her friend Mrs. Pi.es, for womanly sym pathy. But Mrs. Pipes told her tint the whole trouble grew out of not having one of the right kind of sewing machines, that most were, a matter of fiict, traps in which the un- wary were caught. She showed Mrs. Tompkins hers—one of GROVER & BAKER'S, with their peculiar stitch—which she said was a sure preventive against any such calamity as I had experienced .*• t the ball According to her description, while the upper thread in the Brover & Baker machine went through the cloth, the lower thread started off, up the middle down the outside, cist eff right and leit, went round the la>t stitch, dodged through the next, turned a summer sault'hrou *h two cr three stitches atonce,and got up a chaos in each particular one., butproduced aseara mathematically exact, and 1 ?rfectly smooth; an 1 the stPch wai so elastic that the seam would not rip. Notwithstanding ray terrible cxp rience, I bought a Gro ver & Baker machine, at No. 181, BALTIMORE MREET, and Mrs. Tompkins applied it to the fragments of my lnte la mented pantalooas. In a few minutes they were restored to ; their pristine excellence, and for two evenings I put them to every conceivable test by jumping, dancing, bowing and kicking, and the integrity of every stitch has been demon strated, amidst the most terrible temptation to burst asun der.

The feeling in business circles during the early part of the week was very much depressed, but the tone of com mercial affairs generally has improved materially within the past few days. The foreign news received this week is quite reassuring, and it has had a very favorable influ en c9 upen the markets generally. Under it, our great staples cotton r.nd breadstuff's, bave improved in j price, and Stocks have also advanced materially Tom- : mercial and financial affairs continue to be affected by the j state of our political relations, but they are generally ' thought to be less threatening than they were, and the panic seems to us to be wearing itseir out. Money here j continues tight, but there is a somewhat improved feel' j ing in the market to day. The demand is less urgent 1 than it was a few days since, and paper is more readily j placed, although the rates for first class paper on the, street, which is the only description that is negotiable, | still range at from 1 to lj.' per cent, per month. New j York Exchange has been selling to-day at the same | figures as on yesterday, viz: 2# to 3 per cent, pre- I iniuro. The operations in stocks here this week have been large, but the hulk of the business done has been in Rail road shares and bonds. The sales of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad add up about 1,000 shares. It opened at $53, and dropped subsequently to SSO, but advanced again, selling to day at $54#@55, and closing at $5478 bid, $55 asked regular way. Of Northern Central Railway the sales reached about 2,200 shares at from slsdown to sl3#, the closing sales being made however at sl4 cash. There were 225 shares Canton Company sold eaHy in the week at sl3@l3#, but it closed to-day at sl4 bid, sls asked regular way. There lias been "some movement this week in Bank stocks. The sales include S shares Bank of Baltimore at $99,160 shares Citizens' at $10(510#, and 160 shares Franklin at sll. There has been considerable done this week in Loans, but this class of stocks have declined materially. Of City o's there have been some $24,000 sold at 95(594# for 1890's; 94# down to 90# for 1875'5; 92# for lSß6's divi dend on, and 88@S9 for I.BBG's ex dividend; 1890's closed to-day at 92 bid, and lSß6's at 88# bid, 89 asked ex dividend. The sales of Railroad bonds include $49,000 Northern Central lSßs's at from 54# down to 49#, showing a decline in the week of 5 per cent.; $4,500 Northwestern Virginia bonds at 87 for first, and 25 for unendorsed third mortgage; and SIO,OOO Baltimore and Ohio bonds, at from 81 down to 77 for lS7s's, the closing sales being made however at 79; 77(5 79 for ISSO's; and 55 for 1862'5. The sales of Mining'stocks this week include 2,780 shares Gardner nil I, and 3,300 shares Springfield. Gard ner Hill opened at $2.45, and dropped subsequently to $2 15, but it advanced again, selling to-day at $2.40(q) $2.50, but the sales of Spring6eld were made at from $2.05 down to SI.SS, and it closed to-day at $1.85 bid, $2 asked regular way. We note sales also of 750 shares Sil ver Valley at 45 cts; 1,100 shares Cambridge at 30 cts.; 350 shares Silver Hill sold early in the week at 35 cts., and 2,000 shares do. sold to-day at 20 cts.; 1,700 shares Consolidated at 25 cts.; 300 shares Deep River at 25 cts.; and 400 shares Guilford at 35®40 cts., but for Guilford 50 cts. cash was bid to-day. We understand that the first instalment of theassesment on this stock, recently made by the Company, and which is due to-morrow, has already been paid upon upwards of 70,000 shares, and we have been requested to call the'attention of the remaining stockholders to the fact, that by the terms of the vote ordering the assesment, a failure to pay promptly the in stalment due to morrow absolutely forfeits the stock to the Company. he foreign imports into Raltimore for the week ending on Thursday amount in value to $114,405, of which $20,- 700 were free, and $03,618 were duty paying goods, and the value of the foreign exports from Baltimore for the same period was $196,503, against only $340,260 for the previous week.

The New York Tribune of this morning, says: The Stock market opened with considerable firmness, but when Central was reached this was lost, and the de cline in this stock unfavorably affected the whole list.— At the close, however, there was more steadiness, cash stock being scarce, and there was no pressure of any de scription on the market. The foreign bill market is held at higher figures, but we hear of no transact-ons estab lishing the advance. The demand is very limited.— Sterling is par to 104. Francs 5.70 to 5.50 Freights—To Liverpool, 300 bales Cotton at 5.1Gd.; 100 tcs. Beef at 7s. 6d.; 100 boxes Bacon (per steamer) at 55s ; 100 do. do. (per sailing vessel) at 375. 6:1.; 100 bbls. Lard at 405.; 7.000 bush. Wheat at 12.1. in bags; 25,000 bush. Corn at 11)6 in bulk; 2.500 bbls. Flour at Bs. 3d.; 20 tons Whalefoots at 355.: 150 bUs. Fruit at 3s. 6d.; 20 hhds. Hams (per steamer) at 555.; and 15 tons Sperm Oil at 455. Rates are lower. We hear of: To London, 50 tons Cloverseed at 425. Gd.; 1,300 bbls. Oil Cake at 375. Gd.— A private letter from New Orleans states that forty-two suspensions havet ken place, mostly cotton factors. The Philadelphia Ledger of to day says: We hear of no change in the money market, and though there is a more cheerful feeling among all classes of persons, money is still in pressing demand on the street, at rates ruling from 1)6 to 2 percent, a month. The hanks are moderately discounting sixty and ninety days' paper, but only on the very best security. While all cannot he accommodated, and the banks are presumed to be the best judges as to which of their customers are most deserving of accommodation, we cannot refrain from again urging upon their attention the importance and the humanity of their discriminating largely and steadily in favor of those who are large employers. Call loans are effected at B,'a 9 per cent. The Ohio loan is withdrawn from the market. The State debt about to mature is "payable at the pleasure of the State after the 31st day of December, 1860." The State Legislature will meet the first Monday in January, and will at once take measures to pay the debt. In the meantime the State will, of course, continue to pay the interest as heretofore. The Boston and Worcester Railroad Company lias de clared a semi-annual dividend of 4 per cent., which makes the entire dividend for the year 8 per cent. This road is now out of debt, with an excellent road-bed and a full and thorough equipment. The Boston Courier of Thursday says: The market was decidedly more active to-day, and some stocks, the fancies more particularly, brought better pricss The transactions show a much larger volume of business than in any one day for a long time, and quite a buoyant market. The advices from Europe look encour aging on the face of them, but our worst troubles were yet to reach them. Railroads present no material change from day to day though the sales this morning were quite large; but prices are about the same.

The trans actions this week have been light, the sales reported amounting to only about 3,000 bbls.. but they would have been considerably larger, but for the fact that for some days past buyers and sellers have been unable to agree upon terms.

This Court was engaged yesterday in the trial of Robert Miller, indicted for the murder of Franklin Naff. We have received a report of the proceed ings up to the time of the adjourning of the Court for dinner. No new evidence was elicited, and the circumstances attending that murder have been so often detailed in this paper that it is not worth while to print them again. AFTERNOON SESSION. After the State had closed, the defence examined several witnesses who had previously testified in the cases connected with this murder in Baltimore. The only new testimony brought out was the fol- ; lowing: Wesley Woodward, sworn.—Was not present in Lovely lane at the time Naff was shot, but witness and Mr. Walters were going up the lane; when about one-third way up the alloy saw Naff leaning against the wall and told him that ho (Woodward) was a justice of the peace and ho should go with him; Naff asked what for, and a rush was made towards witness; some person struck witness over the head with a billy, and he let go of Naff and went out of the alley to Calvert street; when witness reached Calvert street a pistol shot was fired in the alley, and witness went in tbeallev again and saw Naff'near where he first saw him; ] asked him to come out of the alley, when Naff said, "that's very well, after you've shot me;" Naff" in quired for his hat and Miller walked up and picked the hat up and placed it on NafFs head; Naff" then asked witness to take him to a physician; witness and another man took Naff to Coleman & i Rogers' drug store on Baltimore street; on j the way Naff' again asked witness what he shot him for; witness was arrested, j tried and acquitted; when witness had hold ! of Naff, endeavoring to get him out of the alley, j Broderick, one of NafFs party, pointed a pistol at j witness' face; witness was a friend of Xaff's, and i that was the reason he tried to get him out of" the j alley; Naff was struck with a club and a general ; row ensued, but witness cannot say who struck a ! blow; when witness entered the allev the second j time, and Naff was shot, Miller followed him from i Calvert street, and witness is most sure that at j the time the pistol was fired and Naff' tell, Miller i was standing on Calvert street and not in the alley, i ed that he had been retained as counsel for Wesley Woodward, and after that trial was retained as counsel for Miller; called upon ex-policeman Sta pleford, the first witness in the case, for informa tion in regard to the affair, and lie told witness that ho saw Rob't Miller and Woodward run out of the alley; that he had known Miller from childhood and could not be mistaken in tbe man, but after wards found that he teas mistaken.it being Edward Miller and not Robert. At 7 o'clock P. M., the testimony was in, and the Court took a recess until to-morrow, when the case will be argned. John H. Sellman, Esq., assisting in the prosecution, and li. Stocket Matthews and Bichard Grason, Esqrs., for the defence.

LINCOLN'S CABINET. — TLLO Springfield Republican, of the 11th inst., says : We hear such frequent allusions to a supposed purpose on the part of Mr. Lincoln to call into ni3 Cabinet two or three Southern gentlemen from the parties opposed to him politically, that we are prompted to ask a few questions : 1. Is it known that any such gentleman of char ac'er would accept a place in the Cabinet. 2. If yes, on what terni3does he surrender to Mr. Lincoln or Mr. Lincoln to him on the political differences between them ? or do they enter upon the administration in open opposition to each other? Another English Prince will shortly visit this country. It is Prince Albert, the second son of Queen Victoria, who has left the ship Euryalus, and will join the St. George, a larger vessel, which will sail early next year for the West Indies and North America.

WATCH RECOVERED. —During the lire of Wednes day night Mri James Sutcr. of the Water Depart ment, bad his pocket picked of a valuable gold watch and chain, lie was endeavoring to pass through the crowd on Baltimore street at Charles street, when some person pushed rudc-ly against him and at the same time his hat was knocked from his head, apparently accidently, when he stooped and picked it up, and continued his way through the crowd, in a few minutes he discovered that his watch was gone, lie reported tho theft to Marshal Kane, who placed the matter in the hands of Detective Gormon, who soon learned that the watch could be recovered by the payment of S3O. Richard Ronntree, a noted pickpocket, stated that bo could get, it from the parties who stole it if that sum was paid. The money was furnished, and the watch was handed over to the Detective. Tho officer then compelled Ronntree to give the names of the thieves, which ho did, and two young men, named William Dix and Albert Hamilton, were ar rested. They protested that they knew nothing about the theft, and said that Rountree had impli cated them falsely- They were all three commit ted to jail by .lustiee Iliss for the action of the Grand Jury. A portion of the money was recov ered. TnE LAW the past few months tho Law Greys, Capt. Thomas Bowers, have been prac tising the Zouave drill, and last night they gave an exhibition at their Armory, Metropolitan Hall, to which was invited a largo number of the mem bers of file other military corps of the citv, and numerous friends of the Greys. The galleries were thronged with ladies. The Zouave drill in all its minuthe was executed with a pkil I fulness and precision in the highest degree complimenta ry. It was difficult to discriminate which part of the drill was executed with the most accura cy, so thoroughly was eaeii part performed. The manual was executed' in a manner which called forth the plaudits of the audience, and, in fact, in almost every manccuvre they were cheered.— Capt. Bowers may wc 1 i congratulate himself on tho skill which liis corps has gained. Mo enjoys an enviable reputation as a master of the drill, and the exhibition last night was an evidence that it is well deserved. STATISTICS or TIIC OBPHANS' COURT AND REGISTER OF WILLS. —The Orphans' Court for Baltimore city, during the year which closed 30th ult., grant ed 414 letters testamentary, and letters of admin istrtxtion on octntoo , f daoouevJ poi-eons. Gliqnfi ans were appointed to 277 minor children. Num erous apprentice cases also have been beard and adjudicated. The taxes collected and paid to the Treasurer of the State by Isaac J'. Cook, Fsq., Re gister of Wills, form a largo item in the revenne of the State, and amount to $31,010.77, of which $14,067.23 were taxes on commissions allowed executors and administrators. The estates settled and distributed amount to about $1,750 000. The tax on collateral inheritances amounted to $16,952.- 54 on estates valued at $678,101.C0.

CHARGE OK ASSAULT. —Constables Snavely and Bishop were yesterday arraigned before Justice Sbowacre, charged with committing an assault upon Win. 11. Lupton. The assault was committed on West Baltimore street. It appears that the constables had been in tho western part of the city on some official business, and as they returned, met Lupton, who got into a discussion with Bishop, when the lie passed, and tiie two got to blows.— Snavely interfered as he was about to arrest Lupton, haviDg him by the collar, when Gen. Steuart, who saw the transaction, induced him to let the man go. Lupton afterwards got out warrants for Bish op and Snavely, charging them with an assault, and tho Squire sent the case to Court, after taking security for appearance. STOP YOUR HYDRANTS. —The cold snap which has set in, should admonish housekeepers and others, to be careful not to allow water to run from the hydrants. Great inconvenience results from care lessness in this particular, and many accidents oc cur by persons slipping on the small fields of ice which are formed on the sidewalks. It should be remembered that there is an ordinance which im poses a fine of $lO on any one who allows a hydrant to run, and the city authorities are determined to enforce it in every case. There is also an ordi nance imposing a fine of $5 on the owners of pro perty whs allow ice to rcmrin on the pavement. This also will be enforced, and not as heretofore bo allowed to sleep. INCEsniAP.isM.--On Thursday night about twelve o'clock fire was discovered in building No.l39Scuth Caroline street, near Hank street, owned and occu pied by Sir. Cbarles Fellan as a coopering estab lishment. An alarm was given and the fire de partment ot the Eastern district was promptly on the spot. The fire was no doubt the work of an incendiary, and had gained considerable progress before discovered. The flames communicated to No. 141 adjoining on the south, owned by Captain Henry Hoidafler and occupied by Mr. John Her man. The roof of this building was burnt off. The building in which it originated was destroyed. All the parties are insured ia the Firemen's Insurance office of this city. FIRE.—Tbe alarm of fire last r.ight, from box 13, ftarre near Sharp street, was caused by the burn ing of the roofs of the two-story and attic brick houses, Nos. G and 8 Wayne alley, between Sharp and Howard streets. The fire broke out in the roof of house No. C, occupied by Mrs. Sophia Bayley, (negress.l a widow woman. Her loss in furniture is about S2O; not insured. House No. 8 was occu pied by Mrs. Olivia Butler, (negress.) Her furni ture was nearly all saved; damage about SlO. The houses belonged to the ltev. Father Slatterey, and were damaged to the extent of about $l3O, which is covered by insurance in the Equitable office of this citv. OFFICIAL VlSlT. —Yesterday, Mayor Brown, ac companied by Comptroller McCubbin and Register Thompson, and the Committee on the Harbor, of the City Council, paid an official visit to the Ma rine Hospital, and to a number of the wharves of the city. Judging from former customs, the visit ors were treated very shabbily, not receiving an invitation to eat or drink. Heretofore, on visits ot this kind, there was a fine entertainment pre pared, and "wee drop" was used up in wetting whistles. The reporters did not accompany the visitors, and do not regret their absence under the circumstances. CUAUQEO WITH THEFT. —Yesterday morning a man named William T. Gelley was arrested on tbe charge of stealing a pair of boots and a quantity ol lead and copper, the property of Chas. A. White. Justice Griffin committed him for Court. A young girl named Margaret Rolp was arrested on the charge of stealing fifteen dollars in money, the property of Mrs. Wiseman. The girl has been in this country but a few weeks, and Mrs. Wiseman was boarding her until she could get a home. Justice Griffin committed her for Court. FINE REMITTED. —Governor Hicks has remitted the fine of three hundred dollars recently imposed by Judge Price upon Mr. J. G. Fifzpatrick. who was found guilty at Baltimore County Court of vi olating an act of Assembly, in permitting George Somers, a non-resident trader, to sell goods under bis license. The Governor, it is said, was induced to pursue this course upon the recommendation of a number of prominent merchants in this city, who petitioned him in the premises. ROBBERY. —On Thursday afternoon Dr. May, of Wilmington, Delaware, arrived here in the cars and proceeded to the hoarding-house of Mrs. Acres, West Lombard street. It being dinner-time, the Doctor left bis overcoat and valise in the entry and went to the diningrroom. After his meal he dis covered that his coat and luggage had been stolen. Home thief taking advantage of the absence of ev ery one from thefront part of the house, had walked into the passage and carried off the Doctor's move ables. FAIR AND FESTIVAL. —The Congregatien of the Eighth Baptist Church will hold a Fair and Festi val at Temperance Temple, commencing on Tues day next. The proceeds will be devoted to char itable purposes, and therefore a liberal support should be extended to it. THE LATE FlßE. —Nothing as yet is known cer tainly as to the origin of the destructive lire of Wednesday night, on Baltimore street. . Col. Boyd, Fire Inspector, will commence to-day to investigate the matter by the examination of wit nesses, at his olfica in the City Hall.

She brings 189 passeDgers. There were four deaths on the voyage. THE NATIONAL TOMES, Resignation of the Secretary of State —Lieut. Gen. Scott recommends sending Kciii- fo cements to Port Moultrie. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. —There is no doubt what ever, but that General Cass has resigned his posi tion as Secretary of State. Regret is everywhere expressed in consequence. The present indications are that ex-Governor Dickinson, of New York, will be his successor, though these are not considered altogether reliable. There is but little, if any, confidence reposed in the assurance that South Carolina will not resist the Federal authorilies during the administration of President Buchanan. They are regarded as mere promises to quiet apprehensions in ollicial "-narters. Geo. Scott has expressed the opinion that a;lar; ona j f orces should be sent to South Car. olina, for the of the public property. Ine President, still opposed to such an increase, tor prudenu.i reasons, being apprehen sive that it would but an£*-ent tho present excite ment. There was an understating among the Se lect Committee of Thirty-three, t. day, that their proceedings, excepting as to resu'.ts, shall be regarded as private, and therefore not to be re vealed for publication. It is known, h.* vever that several propositions, looking to political con ciliation, were presented and read, but not acted upon. Several gentlemen made speeches, and. opinions were interchanged. The prospect of an accommodation is about the same as it was yester day. It was in order to afford time for considera tion, that the adjournment until Monday took place. Tho publication of the manifesto of the South ern members has produced a depressing effect among the conservatives, who say they are now satisfied that the former are opposed to any politi cal compromise or accommodation whatever. It is generally reported that Douglas' speech next week will be of a coercive character against secession. Senator Wilson's letter addressed to Hon. Caleb Cushing, will appear in to-morrow's Actional Re publican. 

EXPECTED RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY CASS. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. —There is good reason to believe that General Cass intends resigning his po" sition as Secretary of State. Indeed, it is reported that the President has been so informed, but will endeavor to dissuade him from this course. There is uo doubt that the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Trescott, has resigned. THE 

ACTION OF LOUISIANA. NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 13. —The unanimous passage of the Convention bill fixes the policy of Louisiana for immediate separation and State action. After secession, a general Convention of the slave holding States will be held, and Southern rights forever secured on the formation of the Southern confederacy. Five hundred thousand dollars were appropria ted for arming the State. The bills giving preference to foreign countries over the North in the purcha*e of arms, and con fiscating Northern goods arriving after January, were defeated. Public opinion i 3 overwhelming for secession. Tho duty of the Commissioner appointed by the Governor is simply to devise and secure separate independence and secession. REPORTS FROM CHARLESTON. CHARLESTON, Dec. 13. —The tumor that prevailed yesterday that the banks had resumed, is contra dicted. It is expected that within a month after secession, matters will settle down and business brighten. The Mercury of this morning publishes an ac count of tho operations going on at harbor forts. The garrisons are evidently in dread of an attack, and are preparing night and day for a desperate rc" sistance in such event. There is no disposition here to molest the forts unless the State orders it. The people feel friendly towards the Federal offi cers commanding there, but they regard the pos session of the forts as essential to independence, and would consider any reinforcement a threat of coercion. Tho Charleston Courier believes compromise im possible. CAUCUS OF SOUTHERN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.— At the request of Hon. Reuben Davis, of Miss., member of the Committee of States, tho Southern members of Congress as sembled at his rooms to-night, and adjourned at eleven o'clock, at-which the following declaration was made and signed by those present. It bad al ready been presented to the Committee of Thirty three: THE SOUTHERN MANIFESTO. To our Constituents; The argument i 3 exhausted. All hope of relief in the Union, through the agency of committees, Congressional legislation, or constitutional amend ments is extinguished, and wc trust the South will not be deceived by appearances or the pretence of new guarantees. The Republicans are resolute in the purpose to grant nothing that will or ought to satisfy the South. In our judgment the honor, safe ty and independence of the Southern people are to be found only in a Southern confederacy—the in evitable result of separate State secession. That the sole and primary aim of each slaveholding State ought to be its speedy and absolute separation from an unnatural and hostile Union. Signed by J. L. Pugh, David Clopton, Syden ham Moore, J. L. M. Curry, and J. A. Stallworth, of Alabama; Alfred Iverson, J. W. 11. Underwood, L. J. Gartrell, and James Jackson, (Senator Toombs is not here, but would sign), John J. Jones and Martin J. Crawford, of Georgia; George S. Hawkins, of Florida. It is understood Mr. Yulee will sign it. T. C. Hindman, of Arkansas. Both Senators will also sign it. A. G. Brown, Wm. Barksdale, O. li. Singleton, and Reuben Davis, of Mississippi; Burton Craige and Tho?. Ruflin, of North Carolina; J. P. Benjamin and John M. Lan drum, of Louisiana. Mr. Slidell will also sign it. Senators Wigfall and Hemphill, of Texas, will also sign it. Mr. Davis made the following statement to the caucus: Being a member of the Committee of Thirty-three, I state that the above witnessed dispatch was com municated to the committee this evening, and a resolution passed proposing no specific relief, eight Northern States dissenting, avowedly intended to counteract the effect of the above dispatch, and, as 1 believe, to mislead the people of the South, From information derived from Republican mem bers of tbe committee and other Northern repre sentatives, I fully concur in the above dispatch. REUBEN DAVIS. The manifesto will be immediately communicated to the sevei al constituencies of tbe gentlemen named by telegrapb. It is now ascertained with a positive degree of certainty that the following States will secede on the days named, unless they conclude to keep their conventions in session until that of Georgia meets, which is on the 18th of January, when they will all go out together: South Carolina —Convention meets December 17; will retire from the confederacy December IS. Alabama —Convention meets January 7; retires January 10. Mississippi—Convention meets January 7; retires January 10. Florida—Convention meeis January 3, and will probably retire with Alabama and Mississippi. It is expected Arkansas and Texas will not be long behind them. The idea that any compromise can be offered that will save these States to the Union may hencefor ward be hopelessly abandoned —Cor. of the N. Y. Herald. THE RESOLUTION OF MR. STEWART, OF MARYLAND. The following i 3 tha resolution presented in the House of Representatives on Wednesday by Hon. Jos. A. Stewart, of Maryland, and referred to the Committee of Thirty-three: Resolved, Tliat the select committee appointed on the President's message inquire, among other tilings, if any measures can be adopted to preserve in their purity the constitutional rights of all the States within the Union; and if, in their judgment, this be impracticabie, then further to inquire as to the most reasonable and just mode by which their rights may be secured it: a state of separation, each sovereign State, in tiiat event, being re possessed of its delegated authority to the Federal Union, and adjusting the relative liabilities of each, with such other measures of fair settlement as may appear to them just: and recommend, also, some plan in that event, by which, in the future, if any disputes shall arise, they may be fairly and speedily settled. THE 

REPUBLICAN PARTY AND TUE MISSOURI COMPRO MISE. The New York Tribune, of Wednesday, says: If the free States were ever decided and hearty on any point, they have been on that of refusing to extend the Missouri line to the Pacific and thus concede to slavery all present and future United States territory south of that line. And what thev deliberately and repeatedly refused to do when inoffensively solicited, they should not now be bullied into doing by threats of dissolving the Union. And we intend that they shall not. THE 

HOPELESSNESS OF COMPROMISE. The following is from a letter of the correspond ent of the New York Tribute, dated Charleston, December Bth, 1SC0: I wish that Mr. Corwin and his Congressional Committee, if they entertain the slightest hope of doing anything to keep the Union together, could, for the brief space of thirty minutes, hear how the leaders in South Carolina talk, and how all efforts at conciliation are viewed. If this is a Confeder acy held together solely by public sentiment, and one that tbe bonds of fraternal feeling only can hold together, then tbe case is utterly hopeless, so far as South Carolina is concerned, and I believe all the Cotton States. Words are too weak to express the disgust thev have for the Free States, especi ally New England. The human mind i 3 not inven tive enough to supply invective to express the scorn of the Northern "brethren." The case is be yond hope. SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE BORDER STATES. The Richmond Whig, in dismissing the propriety of calling a National Convention to consider our present national difficulties, says: We find in the Columbia South Carolinian, of the 11th inst., the following: "The cry of co-operation of all the Southern States through a general conference, is a device to prevent the movement. This South Carolina is determined to defeat. She is backed by a party in every Southern State, and she can and will defeat it, even if it takes the issue of war to effect it. She knows no danger equal to that of submission, and that danger she will peril everything to avert." It may be quite true that South Carolina "can and will defeat" the policy of mutual consultation among all the slaveholding States, as proposed with a view to the preservation of their rights in the Union. The signs of the times portend that she will disregard the wishes of all or any among her sisters who desire to preserve their rights and lib erties in conjunction with the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Federal Constitution and se cured by the Federal Union, of which that Consti tution is the bond and symbol. We aredeliberate- iy forewarned that she intends to counteract the policy, "even if it takes tlio issue of war to effect it," and she then proposes, by her precipitate action, to narrow the boundaries within which the people of the border slaveholding States may exercise the inalienable rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." If any among them think that these" high boons can be best secured by the maintenance of all their State rights under the Constitution of the United States, it is boldlv proclaimed that tbev shall not be en trusted with such a freedom of election, but must satisfv themselves with the privilege of being left free to" make a choice of masters. And it is to the people of States like North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Maryland, to say nothing of States like Louisiana, Georgia and others, to whom this haughty language is held.— It remains to be seen whether the States who are most nearly concerned and deep lj- interested in the solution of this problem will consent to receive only that solution which is dictated to them by others, or whether, when all attempts at mutual conference shall have been scornfully repulsed, they will seek to work out their own destiny without the forfeiture of a single State right, as without the forfeiture of a single Federal right guaranteed by the Constitution. 

LETTER OF HON". WSI. C. iIIVES. The following is the concluding paragraph of a letter from Hoc. Win. C. Rives to Hon. Alex. It. Boteler, who introduced the resolution referring the secession portion of the President's Message to the Committee of Thirty-three: At all events, I see no reason to despair of the early success of the work of conciliation inaugura ted try your proposition, to the entire extent of the States I have enumerated, if prosecuted in the right spirit: and when harmony and a good under standing shall have been established among them— the great central States of the Confederacy—what rational motive can be feit by a few isolated States, whether at the North or the South, to stand aloof in sullen contumacy or unprofitable discontent? We lave lately seen auspicious indications that re flections such as these, with a reviving spirit of na tionality, are making daily progress in that quar ter of the Confederacy where the antagonism to Southern institutions has been hitherto the strong est; and I will not yet abandon tho consoling hope that the present troubles of the country, by bring ing more clearl v to light the dangers which threat en us, may end in placing the Constitution and the Union of our fathers upon more solid and lasting foundations than ever. 

ITEMS FROM THE WASHINGTON LETTERS. We take the following from the special despatches to the New Vork and Philadelphia journals: Secessionists and anti-secessionists have been in great excitement over the news which has leaked out from the Capitol to day, concerning the requi sition of Major Anderson,commander at Fort Moul trie, for more men and ammunition, and the action of the Cabinet thereupon. It is stated, on authority which I think is not to be disputed, that Major Anderson has decided upon the necessity for a reinforcement to his command and his supplies, not because lie believed the danger of an attack upon Fort Moultrie by the South Ca rolina forces to be immediately imminent, for the assurances of leading secessionists have been re ceived that there will not be a crisis of this sort pre cipitated; but because, when the secession ordi nance is passed, as it doubtless will be in the early days of the convention, there is no security that a Charleston mob will not make a desperate on slaught upon the nearest Federal possessions. And iPtho men at Fort Moultrie and Fort fSumpter arc to fight, they are too few and their ammunition too scanty. Hut whatever may be the grounds of his demand, there is no doubt that it has been made. The question of acceding to Major Anderson's request has been up before the Cabinet, and it was decided not to grant it. Secretary Cass, it is'asserted, strongly urged the propriety and necessity of the opposite course.— Either Major Anderson was justified in making the requisition or not. If justified, his request should be granted at once. If not, then lie is incompetent to fill his place, and it should bo supplied by some one who would not make a dangerous demand in troublous times. So long as he is in authority, the means of asserting his authority should beconceded to him. In spite of tiiese arguments, which are unan swerable, the Cabinet refused to send any more men or ammunition to Fort Moultrie, and there the matter stands. There arc really but (55 men in garrison at Fort Moultrie. They are well drilled, and Col. Ander son is determined not (o surrender, though the Ad ministration seems willing to sacrifice him, from fear of sending reinforcements. The South Carolina delegation are unanimous against any attempt to interfere with the collection of revenue or the federal property in the State, until every attempt at negotiation with the Gener al Government shall have been exhausted. No ad ditional force is to be emnloyed on any of the forts in the neighborhood of Charleston. Capt. Foster, the engineer in charge, is merely carrying on the work which he commenced last September. There have been no new movements. A gentleman arrived this evening from the bor der counties of Virginia, reports the secession feel ing to have spread with amazing and alarming ra pidity in that region within the past week. As the period of the meeting of lie Conventions of the other Southern States approaches, the Virginians feel that their own State pride, and their devotion to Southern interests, demand that they should af filiate with their Southern brethren, even to the extent of revolution and armed resistance. It is too late to inquire, said a distinguished gen tleman from the South to-day, whether the North or the Month urn to hlnmn. hot it is as clear as light that the North alone can now arrest the ruin that impends. it is understood Kansas will be admitted next week, the Democrats not designing nor desiring to interfere with the wishes of the Republicans. it appears very certain that the Morrill Tariff bill will not pass without several very important, modifications. The Democratic Senators and Representatives from Pennsylvania contend that Lincoln carried that State on the cry of "Protec tion" alone—that the question of slavery never, to any extent, entered into the canvass. They assure Southern members that il the issue was to be tried in Pennsylvania to-morrow, for or against slavery and the constitutional right.-: of the South, it would be decided in the affirmative by a vote of three to one. Mr. Thomas entered upon the duties of Secre tary of the Treasury to-day. lie is far abler than Mr. Cobb, and his experience as Collector of Haiti more gives him useful qualifications. Personally, he is quite acceptable, and greatly esteemed. CLMIDI'S MESS YDK TO HENRY WARD BEECHER. The New York correspondent of the Boston Traveller writes.under date of December •Ith: Chancing to pass the Post Office this morning, I met the Rev. lienry Ward Beecher, who had just taken out a huge mail. Amongst his letters was one from Washington. In the letter was a strip of s:lk about five inches long and two inches broad, on which was neatly printed the following: QOD'S HIGHER LAW. Eleventh Commandment—Spoken by God on Mount Sina i. "Both thy bondmen and bondmaids which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids; moreover, of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy; and they shall he your possession; and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they sball be your bondmen forever." —Lev. xxv., 44, 45, 48. CHRIST'S HIGHER LAW. Commandments to Slaves. [Written chiefly by St. Paul in his Epistles.] "Slaves ( dotdoi) obey in all things your masters, according to the flesb; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God." Coll., iii., 22; Epb., vi., 5; 1 Cor., vii., 21. "Slaves ( douloi) be obedient to your masters, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ." Epb., vi., 5. "Let as many slaves ( douloi) as are under the voke count their masters worthv of all honor." 1 Tim., vi., 1.

Mr. Beecher handed the slip to me, and knowing you to be curious in all matters of public interest, I send it herewith. LATER FROM HAYTI. —By the arrival of the brig 3 War Eagle and Isabel Beurman from Port au Prince at New Y'ork, wo are placed in possession of our files to the 24th of November. There is a report current at Port au Prince thnt seventeen revolutionists had been taken prisoners at St. Marks. * A Havtian man-of-war brig, with troops, bad been sent to that port. The conntry was perfectly healthy. On Friday, thb 19:h of October, at nine o'clock in the evening, a hurricane passed over the city of Mole St. Nicholas, destroying a church and thirty eight houses, and damaging about fifty more, be sides devastating groves and orchards and doing other injury to property. The same hurricane was felt in Jeremie and other parts of llayti. The government has passed a decree providing that al! persona visiting Hayti shall obtain pass ports of the llaytian Consul from the port whence they sail. The captains of vessels, whether Hav tian or foreign, are directed to see that this decree i 3 complied with. All over Hayti subscriptions are .made for La martine's complete works. THE PHILADELPHIA UNION MEETING.— The Inquir cr ofvesterday says: At the time when the great Union meeting was in session yesterday, the streets of Phildelaphia woro the appearance of a high holi day. Xcarly all the places of business on the principal thoroughfares were closed, and Chesnut and Third streets were thronged with people, on their way to and from the meeting. The day itself was delight ful. At sunrise the sky was clear, and the sun shone with great brilliancy. As the day wore on, the heavens were overcast with clouds; but just as the great meeting of the people cor.venc-d the clouds broke away, and from that time on until evening set in, there was a bright, clear sky and a pure atmosphere. May this auspicious omen prove prophetic of the future of our country. A TELEGRAPHIC FEAT. —A Boston paper notices that on Friday evening last the telegraphic opera tor put Portland in connection with Wilmington, N-C., and Charleston, S. C., and transmitted mes sages distinctly. Subsequently, Bangor and New Orleans were connected for the first time, and mes sages sent from Maine to Louisiana. This is prob ably a longer distance than was ever before con nected in the United States, or any land telegraphic line over which intelligible despatches have been sent. New Orleans, to an inquiry of Portland as to the time, replied, 5:55. It was then 10:20 at Port land. NOT APPRECTATKH HERE.—A day or two since one of the Cabinet officers noticing on the coat of a sub ordinate a singular-looking badge, and suspecting its character, requested the individual to call at his room. He then inquired of the young man the meaning of this device. "Sir," responded he in reply,' that is the Palmetto badge, and signifies that lam for secession." "Then, ir," replied the high official, "I will inf rm you that your services in this Department are no longer required, and yonr successor will be appointed to-night."— iWiUe ington Star. GOVERNMENT OFFICERS.— There are at present about 60,000 offices in the gift of the genernal gov ernment, for which we may estimate 600,000 appli cants, showing that a little under one-thirtieth of the people of the United States are interested not so much in the good of the country as in a change of the Administration. Does not this assist in ex plaining why a President is never chosen for two terms now-a-days'? 

PRICE TWO CENTS [From the United States Post-Office Assistant.] POSTAGE STAMPS. The question "what becomes of all the pins ?" is one which has for a long time puzzled the brains of many anxious inquirers after knowledge, and not withstanding the humorous reply of some classical wit, that "tshey fall to the earth and become terra pins," the mystery of the ultimate fate of those useful contrivances remains as far from a satisfac tory solution as ever. It would probablj- be less difficult to find an answer to an inquiry as to what becomes of all the postage stamps, and yet in view of the immense dumber which are daily produced, issued and consumed, the subject could hardly fail to strike any one with a taste for statistics, as a suggestive and fruitful one for investigation. It is not our purpose, however, to enter upon this task at present,'but simply to give our readers a glimpse at the modus operandi of the sale of these conve nient articles, as conducted at our largest post oflice, New Vork. Although the demand for post age stamps is of course almost universal, yet in a city like this, with its large and varied population, the individual consumption is much lees evenly distributed than that of almost any other article in such general use. With some, the purchase of stamps is an event of comparative rarity, and an item of but small importance in ibeir yearly expen ses, while with others it is a matter of daily neces sity, and entails an expense which their annual balance-sheet shows to be no trifle. To accommo date both these classes of purchasers, the depart ment for the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes at the New Vork office is divided into two sections, in one of which ail transactions to the amount of SI and upwards are carried on, while tho other sup plies the more limited wants of those who desire to procure smaller quantities, down to a single "one center." Let us step for a few moments into the first men tioned office, which is situated at the head of tho staircase leading to the entrance to the offices of the Postmaster, Secretary and Cashier. At a counter within the enclosed space formed by a high partition, stands the clerk who presides over this department, busily employed in dealing out to the numerous customers, sheets and portions of sheets of Etamps of divers colors, and bearing different devices, and could we peep behind the partition, we should see snuglv stowed within the recess of a capacious "salamander," a goodly pile of his stock in trade, sufficient, one might think, to supply the needs of all tho letter-writers of the city for months. This, however, he informs us, is but the remains of the last invoice received from the Department, and were it not for the fact that a fresh stock is now on its way, the constant demand would soon exhaust the supply—thereby producing a public excitement which might be better imagined than described. This office is open from 9 A. A!, to 3 I'. M.,and the average sales now amount to about $2,800 per day, and are constantly increasing. The late regulation of the Department by which the prepayment of all postage, both on foreign and domestic letters, is obliged to be made in stamps, has caused a large increase in the sales, as formerly many persons pre ferred paying their foreign postage in money. Until within a short time the 12 cent stamp was tho highest denomination issued, but the large amount which is sometimes required for the payment of but one foreign letter necessitated the use of those of a higher value, and accordingly 24, 30 and 90 cent stamps are now sold, making eight different denom inations issued by the Department, viz: 1, 3, 5, 10, 12, 24, 30 and 90 cents. Of course 1 and 3 cent stamps are in greatest demand, though on "steamer days" tho higher denominations form a large por tion of the sales. In paying large amounts of post age, the number of 10 and 12 cent stamps which it was sometimes found necessary to affix for the pur pose, often increased, by their weight, the amount payable, to tho extent of an additional rate—an objection entirely done away with by the use of the larger denominations. From the opening until the closing hour, the counter is besieged by a steady stream of customers; and "queer customers" some of them are, as we may discover by a few minutes' observation. Here comes one, evidently from the "rural district," a keen, cautious-looking individual, who saunters in in a leisurely way, evidently determined not to betray, by the exhibition of undue haste, any anxi ety to purchase, and unwilling to part with his money except upon the most favorable terms, and after all the solemn formalities of a regular bargain making. "How d'ye sell stamps ?" "That depends upon what kind you want, sir." "Well, let's see what kind you've got." "Ones threes lives tens twelves twenty-fours thirties and nineties," says the clerk, with bewild ering rapidity, and with an utter disregard of punctuation. "How do you sell your three cent ones ?" "Three cents apiece, of course,"44 answers Un official, rather impatiently, with a slight suspicion that he is being "quizzed." "Yes, I s'pose so—that's your retail price—hut you see, I want to get a lot of 'em, and I'd jest as lief get'em of you as anybody else, ifyou'd allow a discount for cash, and take Illinois money—good as wheat." "We can't allow any discount, sir, and we don't take any money except gold and silver," says the clerk, with business-like brevity. "Well, but you see I want to get a good lot of '.em—maybe six or seven dollars' worth, and if you " "Give me three hundred dollars' worth of threes," gays a bank-clerk, who has been waiting the issue of this colloquy with an amused grin on his countenance, but who can't spare the time to enjoy it longer, depositing on the counter a double handful of half-eagles. The gentleman from Illi nois eyes the glittering pile with eager looks, and watches the clerk as he carefully counts over the hundred sheets. "Don't they allow you no discount?" "No, sir," says the bank clerk; "you don't catch Uncle Sam allowing discount—don't do business in that wav." .\m,i ti.„ —ooio.n ra.-toni.,, Lis vi a inns of a "bar gain" effectually dissipated, departs for Wall street to have his "Illinois money—good as wheat," con verted (at a uiodest "shave") into more available currency. Presently in steps an unmistakable Cockney—a very recent arrival. "Oil, give me a queen's 'eatl, please,"—laying on the counter a half-crown. "G ire you what, sir ?—what's a queen's 'cad ?" says the puzzled clerk. "Oh, a queen's 'ead, you know—a—a thingumy what d'ye call it—a stamp, you know—a shilliii' stamp—l've ju.-t harrived 'ere by the Hasia, you know, and i want to send this letter 'oine, to let the hold folks know I've got 'ere safe, you know— ere's 'slf a crown, 1 'aven't a shillin', you know." He is directed to the retail stamp window, with a recommendation there to supply himself with a 24 cent stamp as a substitute for a "queen's 'ead." Next comes a gentleman of the "colored persua sion," who gravely requests to be furnisjied with "tjvo hundred white antelopes," and who rejects with scorn a suggestion that he might have misun derstood his orders. So resisting the temptation to refer him to a menagerie as the only place where his zoological tastes might chance to bfgratified, the clerk supplies him with the two hundred en velopes, and he departs triumphant. Many such odd little scenes as these vary the somewhat monotonous routine of the business of the wholesale department.
