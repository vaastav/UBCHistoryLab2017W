Wanted More Captains. For every groat private cntorprleo or public work captains are needed. Leadership is essential to every for ward movement, and no matter how much cnorgy and public spirit Is possessed by tho people of a com munity, It must bo organised and focusod undar some headship to make It effective. No one can account for the won derful growth and, gigantic strides Omaha tana made during Its briof ca reer as a city without taking Into consideration the fact that the com munity was blessed through its for mative period with captains of wlso foresight and commanding ability. Omaha was nor or a o no-man town nor a one-idea town, and It reached Its pre-emlnont position, and kopt in tho forefront, only through recogni tion of tho leadership best fitted for each particular enterprise or cam paign. In natural course tho tried cap tains of old aro being gradually re tired, and it Is necessary to dovolop the right men to take their places. Without loaders and organizers, re sourceful and alert, and a sufficient number of thorn all tho timo, no city can do more than hold its own whon it ought to bo making progress and forging ahead. That wo in Omaha have tho men with tho nocesaary qualifications for community lead ership goes without saying, and thoy must not bo allowed to Bit inactive in the back seats. Living and Giving. In figuring the items that moke up tho high cost of living, lot no one omit the high cost of giving. There was a time, not so many yaro ago, when for Christinas mother knit tho children each a pair of now mittens, when acquisi tion of a slod or skates by tho 'young hopeful" was tho height of expectancy, when father was con- teat with home-made slippers or a mafch box. la those) good old days giving outside the family was ilmiUd. 'a'a'd' tW th exteat that! it was Indulged consisted chiefly of sharing the kitchen goodies or furn ishing" , useful articles of olobhiig, not always nowly bought for the occasion, ' To twontioth century giving at the Christmas holiday time, as evory odo knows and realizes, has burst all bounds of the former, sim ple life. The money, speet on costly toys for aa only child, la a house hold of only moderate pretentions, would of tea. keep a family a whole mouth ea the olden Male. The cir cle within which gifts are exchanged has likewise mlarged' tremendouslyi aad fresiuetttly Ue gUteertips, are limit 4cL-naaMt - . ' But eaa we get away from the high cost of giving any more than we eaa the high eeet of liviagT We protest, . aad weV eemplala, but we subml( and .eeutlaue to indulge. Despite the wry faee, we -are not sure we would go back if we could. We may , be certala that we woa't wvjiiv uf roprtuBKm or tnrougu dire necessity, Tk Bible. i According; to reorts of the various publishers, 28,000,000 copies or portions of the Bible were printed ia llllr la ,161- laaguave other? thaa Begllsh.

Ta ligures are eloaueat and legieal easagh to speak for them selves. They relate a narrative un paralleled la all the aaaals of sec ular er scared literature.

For six teen centuries, intermittently, a& cording to accepted authority, 11 was In process of preparation bj some forty divinely chosen authors And though It has run the gamut of various translations, Hebrew, Art maio or Syrlac. Greek. Latin and Anglo-Saxon, buffeted the storms of criticism and attack of every age and cycle, still today it Is orinted 600 languages and many more lands to the aggrogato number of more than 28,000,000 a year. One of the most interesting faots of the Bible's history is that It found famo In other than its native tongues Note tho anomaly of this report "printed la 500 languages uuw man angiisn." a sugges tion of audacity, as If English were the original of either t old or new testament, Instead of one oi me latest tongues. We might looit for an analomr. for i nt in Shakespeare or Bacon twvnmin-. famous in Chinese or eomo other far away language Instead of the native English. Here brings to mind notable difference between the Bible and the Mohammedan's Koran. With the Koran the native language as welt as the text is stared and a transition in one would be as fatal la its aotlty as la the other. But believers In the Bible have only deepened their faith la Its lnsplra tlon with each succeeding transla tion. They find something In it stronger than language, able to en duro In all. As a matter of faot, au thorities tell us that of tho 2,000 old Hebrew copies or translations now extant, not one dates back more than 1,000 yoars, showing, as historians agreo, that a wholesale destruction of originals ensued. Further, It Is said that as long as 800 yoars after the death of Moses, copies of tho pentatouob wore found at Babylon, whither, following tho temple's de struction, thoy had been carried con cealed by the exiles. Tho purport of It all Is to deepen the significance of tho perpetuity and undiminished power of tho Blblo, from which so many varying faiths draw the Inspiration of their hope of life and Immortality. Directions for Christmas Mail. Havo you token tho pains to notlco Uncle Sam's Instructions as to Christmas mailt A few of them may bo briefly mentioned here with profit: Mall all matter early; for local dellvory not later than' December 23; out-of-town as early as possible. Wrap all packages securely, write plainly, mark "fragile" things easily broken and don't fall to put tho ad dress of the sondor on tho package Packages not weighing moro than four ounces may bo droppod In street or other mall boxes; thoso heavier must be taken to the post office. "Merry Christmas," "Best Wishes," or a similar -word of greet ing will bo allowod within a pack ago. Parcols should not be scaled or otherwise closed so as to make them unwrapable In the same paper if oponod for Inspection. Ordinary postage stamps, are valid for parcel post matter. Everybody ought to eo-operate with tho postofflce employes, whose task Is harder than ever this year because of tho parcel post, and with the. government la-puttlag the parcel post to the acid test. Some of Its enomles predict Its failure. Let its friends, tho people, prove its success. Publicity as a Prinoiple. The Bee has- always stood for tho policy of publicity with, par ticular rofereaoe to matters ot pub lio administration aad concern. The founder of The Bee used a famllar nxnresaloB whea Huaaleloti attached to official aetloa, "Turn on the searchlight of publicity." And the records show how constantly, fear lessly and, effectively The Bee keeps it turned; on. Ws&ft ft member of the staff on starttag to Llneela to report the legislative session sought Instructions, the only admonition was "Turn on the nearehllght ot publicity." Publicity Is a fixed principle today, still needing further devet opement, but a prlaelple neverthe less In the affairs of all branches of the government. Tha people have learned that oaly la the light of publicity courageously applied are justice and the best results pos Blblo. The people are no longer content to abide the stupid old polloy of concealment, which' gen e rally deserves the rebuke events Invariably accord It, As Intimated, we have not' gone far enough with v principle to reach a yet Us full benefit;' but with Its general acee$taaee, py a erleus, insistent pvelte. we have made yaat strides -forward. Of course, many will ktek. against the pricks ot 'this progress, because, forsooth, the searchlight of public ity is death to devious methods, but they caa no more stop It than can the sand gathered during the dry season In the ehaaael ot the stream, stop the rush . et the Bprtagtlme's overflow freat the headwaters. As Aaterioam Boy. Joh- Huston Xtnley, the new commissioner of education la New York state, is another living exam' pie ot what an American boy may become by dint of applying the best that la In him to the utmost. In many respects he Is quite typical of the youth In this country, who have to meet the world on their own ro Bponslblllty. The rather brief story ot his life reads somewhat like many that have adorned the pages of books, and Is the more Interesting bocause It teaches the realism of heroics. Coming from a country town in Illinois, ho attends Knox college at Galesburg, where, it la said, he partly paid hts way by attending to tho president's horse and cow. He was graduated In 1889 and called four years later to the presidency, himself. While in this office he became the subject ot prophecy by tho Outlook; which heralded him as "one of the coming mon ot the na tlon," inviting its readers to watch him. The Outlook haa made good on Its prophetic vision, for John Huston Flnley has made good. He goes from the presidency ot his stern old Alma Mater to become magaslae editor In New York, then to the newly-created chair of' pol Hies at Princeton, and from thera to the presidency of the great College ot the City ot New York, from which position he was recently called to the still larger and more Influential one of head ot the educational work ot the Empire state. And the path behind John Huston Flnley Is still open to others of his kind, to any American boy, in fact, with good powers and grit aad gumption. Short Messages. In tho brevity of bis message to congress President Wilson shows the right Idea of how to get attention to the main Issues before the nation. Both congress and the country are moro apt to consider subject ot Importance presented la a message ot 8,000 words than In one of 20,- 000 words. The fact la, main issues are likely to be lost In a wearying dtotraotlon of little and unimportant things set forth at great length. Whatever may be said of the recent message, its terseness and brevity command general approval. Who will say that a president reading his own message of 8,000 words to con gress will not got a better hearing than by sending a ponderous docu ment to be read by a moaotohous volced clerk mumbling it almost to defy understanding? The constitu tion never intended In providing that the executive shall from time to time give congress "Information of the state of the union" a detailed dlsoussion of every subject that by a Btretoh of construction could be brought within the purview of pres idential mossagos. The Texas Floods. Having experienced a brand of weather more befitting to Septem ber than December, we ot this sec tion aro impressed by the con sistency with which capricious ele ments have sustained themselves throughout the present year. But attention turns at this time toward the devastation in Texas, where the Bracos river, rising to a width ot from three to five miles In the low lands. Is flooding vast areas aad wiping out millions of dollars ot property and scores of lives. Peo ple who near the beginning of the year felt the horrifying force of a death-dealing tornado, or In Ohio ware Inundated by the rush of mighty "waters, feel at such a time a swelling tide of compassion within their hearts for the sufferers of tho southland. Theirs will be a big and bitter calamity ea tha verge of winter, which evea near the mild coast of Texas brings some extra hardships. For more than fifty miles, so re ports say, the Brazos stretches to a width ot from three to five miles and, .speeds on its angry course like a mill rase. The wonder "is that hundreds instead of scores have not been lost aad that 860,000,000 In stead of $6,000,000 of property has not been destroyed. The final tolls are apt to" ow heavier losses, too, when the tide rolls away and a eom plete survey Is possible, The supreme court did the hand some thing in sustaining the Wash ington state law giving the wife ef a homesteader half Interest in the land obtainod by her husband from the federal g overrun eat. The bur den ot pioneering falls aa heavy oa the woman as she man. The story of western conquest would be very different but for the self-aacrlfic and fortitude of the woman oa the frontier, In their terthoomlag campaign Nebraska sutfraglstB are to have the help of preteeeloBal organisers seat In from the outside. Now, without enlisting for or against the cause we do not hesitate te say that we be lieve our Nebraska, women are quite equal to the task by themselves. It Is all oft now, says Rev. Br. Anna Shaw, because the president failed to iaoiude a plea tor woman' suffrage la his message. Oh, cheer up. No presidential message yet has ever Included such a plea, and just look at the progress ot the causb, In spite ot presidents. Really, those real eetaters ought to be more considerate of the feel ings of our Water boarders. That they should rush Into court for re lief after waiting only a year and a half for the Water board to do some thing Indicates the height of inex cusable Impatience, The ruling ot the court Is that ac quisition by the city ot the water works has made the property abso lutely tax free, which formerly paid taxes approximating 2100.000 year. Surely, then, the water users are entitled to an offset In reduced water rates. Tho Inter-Ocean's Washington correspondent describes the mem bera ot congress as "fretful school boys cheated out ot a vocation Which, ot course, must put them In an excellent frame ot mind for speedy and Joyful co-operation with the teacher. Dr. Eliot says the Immigrants are living up to our Ideals, which ought to be nuffldent to ask ot those who come from countries so dissimilar to ours. As 4 rule, they are not only doing this, but In many ways helping us to come closer to some of our own Ideals. lopkinigaclsward' coM-oia rsoM sic nui

CYNICAL MUSINGS. The social climber Is naturally looking for a family tro. Many a man would rather eltmb up ward than be on the level. Clothes may not make the man, but they help a lot In classifying him. Many a man Is a good husband simply because he hasn't the nerve to be any thing else. No man should put up a bluff unless he feels he has the strength to surmount It If necessary. Bomo men are so constituted that they have to be provided with either a pace maker or a peacemaker. Wto are apt to lose sight of the fact that the man who sues for a girl's hand may Uv to sue for his freedom. We are all ruled by precedent In spite of which all the horrible examples In the world won't prevent people from getting married.
