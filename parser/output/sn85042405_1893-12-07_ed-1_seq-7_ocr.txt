IN .SESSION AGAIN. Both Houses of Congress Convene ttt Noon, With the Usual Cere­ monies. Committees Appointed to Wait On the President and Notify Hint ('011 gress I" Session. After a Recess of an Hour the Mes­ sage Is Read In Both Houses. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5,—The encircling galleries of the house, except those re­ served for the president and diplomatic corps, which looked gloomy and vacant, were filled to overflowing with the eager nnd expectant persons, when Speaker Crisp, dignified and stately, ascended the rostram at high noon and rapped the regular session of the Fifty-third con­ gress to order. Fully a00 members were in their seats. Conspicuous upon the floor were the two vacant chairs of Representative O'Neill of Pennsylvania, the "father of the house," and his col­ league, Mr. Lilley, the representative at large from the Keystone state. Their desks were draped in black and covered with floral tributes. Among the dis­ tinguished visitors on the floor when the house convened was ex-Postmaster Gen­ eral Don M. Dickinson of Michigan. Rev. Bagby. in his invocation, referred feelingly to the death of '-Father" O'Neill and Mr. Lilley. According to the rule at the opening of the session, the speaker then directed the clerk to call the roll in order to officially ascer­ tain the presence of a quorum. Passed One Kill. Chairman Sayers, from the committee on appropriations, asked unanimous con­ sent for the consideration of a bill appro­ priating $50,000 additional to pay the salaries of officials engaged in the en­ forcement of the Chinese deportation and registration act of last May, and the amendment to that act passed at the extra session. Mr. Baker of New York objected. He afterwards withdrew his objection, how­ ever, and the resolution was passed. Mr. Hines of Pennsylvania asked unanimous consent for the consideration of a resolution for the appointment of a committee of live to investigate the Le­ high Valley railway strike, its causes, the loss of life and property, and to rec­ ommend any feasible general legislation for the prevention of strikes in the future. Mr. Kilgore of Texas objected and the resolution was referred under the rule. Upon motion of Mr. Dockery, the house then at 12:55 o'clock, took a re­ cess until 1:10 p. m. At 1:25, two new members having been sworn in, the committee appointed by the house inarched down the senate aisle and faced Mr. Wilson, the chair­ man, and announced that the president would immediately communicate a message in writing. The message was then delivered to the speaker, and the clerk began its reading. THE 

SENATK. Similar Opening Exercises to Those of the Home. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.—The first sen­ ate session of the Fifty-third congress convened at high noon pursuant to the constitutional provisions. "The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time" had apparently tripped lightly through the lives of senators during the brief vacation period, and brighter faces greeted one another than when 80 odd days ago, tired and showing signs of a parliamentary struggle unequaled in the history of the government, the repre­ sentatives of the state left the National Capitol. All traces of that memorable battle seemed effaced, and the greeting amongst senators bore the evidence of warm fraternal friendship and personal regard. In the Galleries large crowd had gathered to witness the opening of the session, and the bright colors in the ladies gowns and bonnets were the more conspicuous because of the sombre hued background. As the massive clock over the main entrance announced the hour of la o'clock the blind chaplain was led up to the vice president's desk, and after an eloquent prayer, while all senators present in the chamber remained standing, Vice Presi­ dent Stevenson called the senate to order. At the suggestion of Senator Sherman the roll of the senate was called and 50 members responded. The usual resolu­ tions notifying the house of representa­ tives of the meeting of the senate and the resolution for a committee of two senators to join a similar committee of the house To Wait Upon the President of the United States and inform him that congress had assembled and was ready to receive any communication he may desire to make, were offered and agreed to. The chairman appointed Mr. McPherson (Dern., N. J.) and Mr. Sher­ man (Rep., O.) as the committee on the part of the senate. After a resolution had been adopted that the hour of daily meeting of the senate shall be o'clock meridian, on the motion of Senator Harris, a recess at 12:10 was taken for •ne hour to enable the committee to Wait on the president. At the expiration of the recess at 1:10 a. m. the senate resumed its session, and message from the honse of representa­ tives informing the senate that a quorum of the house was present and of the appointment of a committee to join similar committee of the senate previ­ ously appointed to wait upon the presi­ dent. Then another recess of 20 min­ utes was taken upon motion of Mr. (Dem., Tenn.) Promptly at 1:38, the senate resumed its session, and Mr. Mcl herson of the committee to wait upon tho president, uppeared at the bar of tho senate and announced thai the president would immediately communi­ cate with the house in writing. Secretary Pruden at once steppod for­ ward and delivered the message and it was laid before the sonate by the vice president who directed its reading. Tho secretary of the senate, Mr. Cox, then began the reading of the message. These Attracted Attention. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The recom­ mendations relative to an international monetary conference and the request for further authority for the issue of bonds caused many significant shakes of the head on the part of extreme silver men. The president's bold endorsement of the pension policy of the interior depart­ ment, of civil service reform and his ap­ peal for rigid economy in appropriations also attracted attention. Polled On the Income Tax. NEW 

YORK, Dec. 5.—A morning paper prints opinions of 171 members of con­ gress on the subject of taxing incomes. Of these 71 favor an income tax in some form, 62 oppose it, 5 are against it, but may reconsider, while 33 asked to be ex­ cused from expressing an opinion. The Stein Failure. NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—The examination of the affairs of the firm of Stein & Co., which failed for over $1,000,000 on Fri­ day, continued under the direction of Receiver Wiles, who said that the straightening out would take longer than was at first thought. He also said that the action of the London and River Platte bank and the German bank of London, enjoining the receiver from disposing of certain warehouse receipts was not unexpected. Senior Partner Abe Stein is on his way to this country. It is thought his presence will expedite the receiver's work. Knjoiii tho New York Central. i'frcw YORK, Dec. 5.—The motion of Emil Colberman and tho stockholders of the New York and Northern railroad to enjoin the New York Central and Hud­ son River railroad from voting on tho majority of stock which it held of the New York and Northern, has been de­ nied by Justice Andrews of the supreme court. Crew Narrowly Escaped. PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 5. During a heavy blow on the coast the two-masted schooner, M. E. Bayard, Captain Camp, from New York to Norfolk, Va., while attempting to make the Delaware break­ water for harbor, da.slied against the rock built ice breaker and was almost rent asunder. The vessel immediately filled with water and her crew of five men narrowly escaped death, but were finally rescued by the life savers. Ituciiig in Mcxico. CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 5.—The in­ augural of the Penon race track brought out the largest and most enthusiastic crowd ever assembled in Mexico. Presi­ dent Diaz and Mrs. Diaz, the cabinet and diplomatic corps, were present, to­ gether with the elite.of Mexican society. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed throughout. In the pools the Mexicans learned readily the American system of betting and laid heavy wagers, es­ pecially on Mexican horses. There were about 3,000 carriages inside the grounds and two military bands furnished music. Propeller Ashore. MICHIGAN CITY, Ind., Dec. 5.—The propeller F. W. Wheeler, bound from Buffalo, N. Y., for Chicago, went ashore here at 3:30 p. m., with 3,100 tons of coal aboard. She is damaged, and if the storm continues may go to pieces. The steamer is owned by B. Whitney, Jr., of Detroit, and is valued at |120,000, with no insurance. The crew of 16 meu were rescued by the Michigan City lifesavers, amid a blind­ ing snow storm and a furious sea. The Cable Broke. ALLENTOWN, Pa., Dec. 5.—Ice cansed the cable to break at Joel Neff & Co.'s slate quarry, near Slatington, as three men were being lowered into the pit to begin their day's work.

ELPASO, Tex., Dec. 5.—Persons who arrived from Cluhuahua confirm re­ ports of revolutionists of a severe battle between the federal troops and the in­ surgents. 18 X0T PATERNAL. Little Likelihood That Congress Will Do Anything to Assist the riicinploycd. It Would lie Too Heavy a Bttrdrn and the Treasury Is Too Low, Income Tax Has Narrowed Down to a Tax on Corporations and Patent Medicines. WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.—Letters re­ ceived here and inquiry among senators and members indicate that there are many people throughout the country asking themselves whether congress can be counted upon during the approaching session to do anything in the interest of the communities which have suffered nnusual hardships because of disasters or dull times. Reports are generally to the effect that a hard winter is to be ex­ pected in various sections, and that actual suffering will be experienced in many places. City and country alike report unusual numbers out of employment. In the Western ag­ ricultural regioas, the low price of grain and livestock, in the South the cotton depression, in the Rocky moun­ tains, the shutting down of many of many of the silver mines, in the towns of New England and the Eastern and Middle states the closing of manufac­ turing establishments and the reduction of forces are reported. While all these causes have had the effect of driving members to the large cities, thus in­ creasing the quota of idle people, un­ usually large this season because of the general and local cauees in the larger centers of population. Many people seem to think that at such a time con­ gress ought to furnish assistance in some way, either by gratuitous distribution in specially marked cases, or by means of public works. Not a l'iiteriiiil Government. Congressmen, when asked to express their views of the probability of such assistance being given, shake their heads significantly. They say this is not a paternal government, and each com­ munity will have to depend upon its own resources. When Senator Hoar, during the extra session, made an effort at the instance of Miss Clara Barton of the Red Cross society to secure an ap propriation of sjyiO.OOO for the relief of the Sea island sufferers of South Caro­ lina, he met with stubborn resistance at the hands of Senators Turpie and Coekrell. Senator Butler, representing the state in which these unfortunate people reside, while not antagonizing the bill, said he did not endorse the principle, and Senator Pelfer said if gov­ ernment aid was to be furnished in that instance he should demand like assist ance for the people of the West, upon whom no less a calamity had fallen. It was thus made apparent that if a gratuity should be rendered in any one case it would be demanded in various others, and, as a consequence, Mr. Hoar was unable to secure the slightest con­ sideration for his appropriation. Uncle Saw Hard Up Too. With reference to the question of in­ creasing the outlay upon public works, the fact is pointed out that if this plan should be attempted it would have to be undertaken upon so large a scale to fur­ nish real relief that the treasury would not be able to meet the extra demand upon it, and it is shown that the United States treasury, like many individuals, is in hard straits at the present time. Even in the case of the public buildings authorized by acts of congress, no extra efforts are being made to have the work begun or pushed along because of the condition of the public funds, and of the fact that a deficit instead of 1 surplus is in prospect. 

INCOMES AND 1NTEUNAL KEVENIE. What Will Probably He Done b.v the Ways and Means Committee. WASHINGTON. Dec. 1—Those who have been counting ujion an internal rev­ enue bill to be reported by the Demo­ cratic members of the committee on ways and means, which would revolu­ tionize the whisky and tobacco tax, may yet be disappointed. The whole ques­ tion of internal revenue has been dis­ cussed pro and con by the committee and a wide range of plans canvassed. The question has been found to be one of the most difficult of all that the com­ mittee has been called upon to deal with and it is asserted by those in a position to know, that there are members of the committe who Have Changed Their Views on material points since the exchange of opinion was begun and since their re­ search and investigations have been di­ rected into different channels by fellow members and by outsiders. It is, for instance, said that almost all of the members were favorable to a heavy increase of the tax on whisky and to­ bacco, when they first met as a commit­ tee, but it is now asserted that the views of many of them have undergone such a radical change upon this question that it is even doubtful whether a majority can be found favoring any increase whatever upon the present rates upon these articles, and that if there should be any increase it will grudgingly be given, and only because the reduction of duty proposed by the tariff bill will ren­ der it necesrary to increase the collec­ tion from internal revenue sources. Later information is confirmatory of the prediction heretofore sent out that the income tax proposition of which so much has been said of late will not ex­ tend much beyond the imposition of a tax upon the net earnings of corpora­ tions and upon bequests. It is quite certain that the bill will contain provi­ sions of this kind, and also that a .Stiff Tax on Proprietary Medicines will be levied. This latter tax is meet­ ing with general favor, because of the prevailing belief that large profits are mode upon this class of medicines, and uLso because of the simplicity of collect­ ing the tax, which can be done by the Bale of stamp!!. It is not believed that the committee will find many sittings necessary to complete the internal rev­ enue bill, and the prediction is made that it will be sufficiently advanced to make public Friday night or Saturday. The one great problem which is agitat­ ing the committee is that of finding a means for making good the deficiency which will be caused by the tariff reduc­ tions, and some of the members are Baid to have reached the conclusion that do the best they may there will still be im­ perfections of this character when the bill shall have passed the house whicn will be left to the senate to deal with, and they count upon many changes in the latter body. It is even thus early hinted that the senate will report a sub­ stitute for the entire bill. 

ADMIRAL STANTON ARRIVES. The Recalled Naval Otlicer Reaches New York From ISIo. NEW YORK, Dec. 1.—Admiral Stan­ ton, who was relieved of his command of the South American squadron for •'saluting the insurgent Admiral Mello in Rio harbor," arrived here on the steamship Spree. In conversation with a representative of the Associated Press, Who boarded the Spree at Quarantine and came up to New York with him, the admiral said: "I sailed from Rio on Oct. 31 on the steamship Thames, my intention being to sail for New York on the City of Paris, which I missed by six hours. I then arranged to sail on the Spree from Southampton Nov. 22. The Associated Press man asked Ad mirnl Stanton if he would say anything about ui„ incident in Rio harbor which resulted in his being relieved of his com­ mand. "I will have to ask you to excuse me from speaking of that," he replied. "I really know nothing about it. I re­ ceived a dispatch from the navy depart­ ment ordering my immediate return but I have no official information as to why I am recalled. I, of course, know why, but could not speak of it nor say any­ thing on the subject until I have re­ ported to the secretary of the navy. I have had scarcely any opportunity to see the newspapers since I sailed from Rio, and have only seen the English pa­ pers." The admiral will go to his home at New London, Conn., and await further orders from Washington. He said the outcome of the Brazilian rebellion was difficult to predict. No great damage had been done on either side. EXTEND THE MINING LAWS. A Bill to Make Them Applicable to Minnesota. WASHINGTON-, Dec. 1.—Congressman Baldwin will introduce immediately after congress assembles a bill extending the general mining laws to Minnesota. This is to provide for withdrawing min­ eral lands in the northern part of Minne­ sota from hetnestead entry. Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan were excepted from mining laws applicable to other states. The bill is being drawn by Land Commissioner Lamoreaux. It will pro­ vide that homesteads known to be on mineral lands shall be cancelled by land officers as in violation of the homestead law, to prevent wholesale grabbing of mining claims along Rainy river. Wisconsin's Crack Shot. WHITEHALL, Wis., Dec. 1. To Trempeleau county belongs the honor of having one of the best long distance rifie shots in the world. L. E.

After Lottery Companion* KANSAS CITY.
