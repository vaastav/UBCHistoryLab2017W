"We arc indebted to Col.

THE IniSrEXTS 

MESSAGE. In laying this important document be fore the readers of the Usiox and Dis patch, this morning, ;yvc offer; pur con gratulations that, in its author, the coun Â¬ try has at the helm a patriot' and states man, who is guided by the old chart of Republicanism, and who keeps steadily in the right course, unbafilefl by contrary winds, and unbleached by the storm that rages around him. .He is calm,, and more prudent, more firm and stronger in pro portion as tho dangers increase, and as the necessities ot his position require. Andrew Johnson, as a statesman and as the Chief Executive of a Government, which it is not an empty claim to call the mightiogtnmong the jnighty, wasTiavprj stronger man iu mis moment, rttuuuing upon the Constitutidn,' with the' emblem of unity in his-grasp," he is invulnerable to any assault that can or may bo directed at his person. The attacks upon him arc leveled, at the principlesjand institutions he proclaims, and he only fails when they fail. The great and controlling fact by which he is"guidedj he announces with admira ble precision i in 3aying: "In all the States -civil authority has superseded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary action, are maintaining their govcrnmcntljlin fiilf actiTjtyfttnd complete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer 'obstructed in any .Htatc by combinations . too.powbrful to-be sup pressed by thp ordjpary course of judicial proceedings.'' Tins iruth removes all obstacles' undor tho Constitution, and leaves" that instrument and the laws passed in pursuance in their full force and operation in all the States of the Union, as designated by tho framors of tho. Gov ernment It places the country in pre cisely the same condition it'.waon.the first day of December. I860, save the one alteration made by three-fourths of the States in the organic law of the Union since that- datg. Prom tthe .mqmcnt .of this restoration of tho national authority, resistance ended ; and if criinos had been committed, tho remaining functions of government should bo addressed to establishing tho guilt and inflicting. the attaching punishment upon the r.ersons who committed the oflbnsaS The citations. from thq Constitutional ing the rignfs of tho States, the prinpi pies whioh require representation, the warnings and counsels of Washington and Jefferson, are. well selected by tho President; and tho whole argument of the message upon the subject of restora tion is a specimen of clear, close," terse and convincing logic, which we regard as unsurpassed and irrcfragiblc. Tho treatment 'of our rolations with Foreign Governments is brief and com prehensive, and embraces all material facts necoesnry to a fair comprehension of them by Congress and the country at large. Those with Franco and Bnglaud, including the Mexican Republic, em bracing questions of great pith and deli cacy, are handled with n frankness and firmness which will be impressivo without beinir offonsivc. The Fonian invasion of Canada, and his action, is fully, fairly, and satisfactorily stated. The administration of tho several Exe cutive Departments is referred to at suffi cient length, but without encumbering the message with useless details. Altogether, tho document beforo us, in matter, manner nnd tone, is unexcep tionable,' and is a vast improvement in stylo nnd comprehensiveness upon most of those that have been delivered to Con cress during tho last forty years.

SOME FUSXY P1I ANES OF THE KADI- CAE CAUCUS. T,he "JfadicalcVucas in, VWashington Saturday night niust have been a funny affair. The report of jits, proceedings shpws how unfit the men who composed it are, toj lcgislatejAioa nation. u&hofJ were swayed by prejudices and passion alone, justice arid right never once'enter- mg into tnynoughta tawnier. WeygajeJ expreslionpejOTrrWponcjenf Sf thp'l Cincinnati Commercial telegraphs that "they had tumultuous time,'? aid )Kat "everybody who had anything to say asrainst the .President was -vociferously 4 r. V. n il.n it .( ' r r nftiri,.i1 n n.. nn I thing in his favor." It is quite evident that no man wouldfiave bcenf permitted to say anything in favor oi the President, for ttiey had met to condemn 'him in everything .possible and to. praise him in nothing. Something ef me i eraper of this cabal may be iaferredjifroni a single episode reported by the Commercial's orrcBPoriacnLJ.-t T : e'4 ;ifW "Thad. Stevens offered a resolution that the Republican members of the Scnatebd sav's "the watch-dogs of. "foe nation must requested not to confirm any anpointees,.oT., , , . , . t . the President when they were removed for political purposes. "A perfect storm of applause followei this. JDeska were rattled and hands clap ped, when Mr, Spalding, of Ohiohad the temerity to rise apu question thengutful- ncss ot uie proposition, lie uiu not see how he could vpte or ,any such rqne8t lie oeueveu tue cenaie was as wjii ac quainted with the needs ofNihe,fcc8untry as the House was, and the Senators know a? well as Representatives wliat was boEVto be done in such an emergency. j This drew Thad. Stevens" from his chair. He jumped like an acrobat, and, as lfe took the iloor, he. was liberally applauded, in ad vance, his Bentimenta being easily antici paled. He pitched into Spalding in a ter rible way. Said he: '4JVe , aroitje reprej, sentatives of the people,' and we'know quite as well as the senate, what tlie country de mands. We have a right to advise the Senate, and as we are fresh from the people weougui to Know wnai me peopie wanr. In conclusion, Thad. cast a withering look at Spaldingand quietly remarked hat ho did not knowwhat selfish purpose'tliat gen tleman had in view. He didn't know what vacancies were to be filled in Ohio. He heard, of a Judgeship, orso.mcthing othat sort, but lie hoped that the representatives of the people would stand up to the work before them, and do it as became ifieh' of principle and courage." ' The ferocity with wlUch Stevens at tacked JUr. galdinTtor daring, tqques tion the prbprietyi ofmaking, sounusual it .request of the Senate, is convincing proof that nothing like fair-dealing would be tolerated by tho men who follow tho lead of the Pennsylvania'autocrat" ' That chronic fault-finder, Judge" Kcllejr, of Philadelphia, could scarcely find words possessing sufficient acrimony with which to abuso tho President, his dia tribes in that line having become "stale and unprofitable." Tic declared that '"in his city tho appointing power had been horribly abused," and capped the climax by asserting that '"many men whom he, as criminal Judge, had sentenced to the penitentiary, had been appointed to offices of high trust and profit" The Commer cial's correspondent says : ' "One case especially occurred to Judge Kelley just then. . It was that of a man who had once stolen- a steam 'engine from the navy yard, and, hidden it.somcrhere. He was found oufcand"broui;Iilitlback.Js soon as the matter 61 luislied'up he stole it again. He had since then stolen all the copper, arid riietal- he could carry-off. He was one of the President s appointee. For a wonder, this effort of Judge Kelly had Us legitimate effect, for 'according to the Commercial's correspondent, several members here said that was nothing to what had been done in their districts. One man 6aid the Collector in his district stole a house and lot . Another said the Assessor where he lived had been arrested once or twice for picking pockets. A third said that the postmaster of his town was known to have stolen twenty grind stones. There are very few rnenwho could survive this turning into ridicule what was meant by Judge Kelly to be a rushing blow at the President ' He must have been lost to all sense of propriety if ho did not feel the keen edgo of this to- buke administered by his Own friends. This ludicrous turn in the windlwork of the caucus seems to have affected all present in 'a rather singular way, for after a feeble echo of Judge Kelly by r. Dar ling, of New York, we nrc'idltl that ' "The caucus resolved itself into a sort of Methodist mass meeting, only that, instead of telling each other what .the Lord had done for them, they related what the devil, in the person of Andjew Johnson, had been at since the adjournment of Congress. Such a list of woes never was given out be fore." After this interchange of "experien ees," Mr. Stevens' resolution was adopted, even Mr. Spalding not voting against it, "satis fied that it would not be safe.to do so." One other episode in this gathering of Radical spirits is worthy of note. When Mr. Spalding moved that; the committee, appointed by the caucus "to report a pro gramme of action'' bo instructed to re port upon tho expediency of calling the fortieth Congress together on tke 5th of Maroh next, " Mr. Garfield iumned un and 6aid he had a bill for convening the ' fortieth Corigrejs on the -uh ot March already drawn up. He intended to press it earlv. He said ke believed the watch-docsof the nation oucht to be kept on guard all the time, Great these architects ot ruin- were re joiced at the prospect of having an oppor tunity .of commencing their work again imnrcdiattjfr upjm thadnrnment bfjflie present ngress, lnsteadofn.ving to wait until Decemberand thevcould not 'J i "v restrain their feelings JJk, O Altogether, this must have been the . i i in'tne capifoiofthenaMon.

The? prcceedings of the Radical caucus betoken ovil, if -they are a, foretaste of t!i8 action of Congress. The result of tlie fall elections in the Northern States seoms.not toihave tempered thol lea'ders into magnarimity, nor does the immense conservative vote polled ,against thcu seem to sober tliem. into prmfencei ' Sfe vens Boutwell, Garfiejd, Schenckr Bing. ham, Kelley," Spalding," ixll are still steeped to the lips in hate, and each ap: peanng 4io outvie. jus.ieuuw.

"We" shall see in a few weeks how much bark and how much bite there is in them. A joint resolution was passed in the Arkansas. Lggislaturp,,, recently, galling upon tho Governor for such information as ha may possess in reference to an at tempt made 'in tho western portion of the State "to overthrow? the present State Government," and asking what legisla tion; if any, is necessary "to aid him in - -t J-i suppressing inis on any ouier uisioyai movement" The resolution is under stood to have been called out by a move ment on the part of the "Southern loyal isTs'? of the State for a convention to con sider the condition of tho State, politically 'and generally, and to deliberate on such measures of reform in their local govern 3nt as seem to be necessary. The Cincinnati Commercial alluding to "his inatter, says : "The call .for this con vention, to be held at Fort Smith, on the 13th; instristbeforo us as 'we write. Wo can find in it no expression-of a purroso to overturn the government of the State through any other than peaceable means, and isuch as a free peoplo may legiti mately employ, within tho limits of their own Constitution and that of the United States. They proposo to go back, build up ajnew SCite (edifice Ifrom, Uie founda- J 1 !i i 11.- i lion, ana lay us corner sione uu uiu im mutable principles of justice and truth." The State Government of Arkansas was organized under the auspices of Mr. Lin colnthrough the medium of a Provisional Governor, just as the State Government of Tennessee was. It has all the forms of legitimacy, and more of its substance thnn ias the government of this State, for it has tlie consent and support of a very largo majority of the people, while in Tennessee the large majority arc writhing under the ruinous rule of a minority. It it held to be altogether proper for the factious minority in Arkansas to assem ble a convention to depose a State gov ernment which displeases it, but when it is. suggested that a State convention be held in Tennessee to revise the Constitu tion ar.d rcstorc'lhe republican forms and the rights of the majority, itis denounced as rank treasont and fire, sword, and hal ter are invoked o arrest it and punish its projectors. i ; The President has discomfittcd the .thimblerigging politicians- by ignoring the discussion of- constitutional 'amerid menta, and the negro suffrage issue. He know that a message to Congress was not the proper place to discuss questions so wholly within the province and jurisdic tion of the States ', but the thousand arid one wiseacres" who think they could con duct' the government as easily as they throw off a political paragraph, would have had him discuss and argufy every topic in the rango of governmental scis ence, and provoked a controversy with every crotchet in the land. . What possible connection is there be tweenUhe Chief Justiceship ani tho administration of the Internal Revenue Department, that the rabid fools in Con gress should want to make its officers ap pointablc by that functionary? Trie step is an innovation upon the Constitution and on common sense, and a lowering of the dignity of the position of first judicial magistrate. It is cither a petty exhibition of party spleen towards tho President, 'or a bold stroke to accomplish some scheme of plunder and corruption. In every as pect it is disgraceful. Tunnn isn't a Radical in Congress, no r all of them combined, that,, can refute the clear and cogent reasoning of the Presi dent n the right and propriety of prompt restoration. It is simply, irrefutable. in its logic, and in every respect as far above the rant ond potherof the Radical caucus as dignity, is, above pot-house scurrility. t ' . . : A -

With high considerations of cordial gratitude we Uerirc encouragement, from what you hare already done, tp lay before you the following brief exhibition, of the great wants of this State, and ask for them your geperous and liberal con sideration: The great uemand and momentous interest of this Stato to which w.0 would invito your attention, wfi respectfully represent to your honorable body, that the Idyal citizei.S of Ten nessee have undergone a perfect wreck and bankruptcy by reason of the ravages of war, during the late rebellion. In the first instance wo were subjected to the iron rule of conscrip tion and imprisonment'. Second, banishment from our homea and families', leaving everything that; was sacred ttus in the hands of thejnerci less foe.' And while thus rnakine sacrifices and precarious embarkmcnts for the salvution of our country s banner, we were advised and en couraged" that we should be fully paid for our losses on account of the war. The debt,, how ever, contracted in tho prosecution of the late rebel lion remains, toajgrcat dcgrecuncancelled. Arid while your memorialist would thus repre sent unto your, honorable body and. make you ocauainted with all the circumstances' fully under which tho debt was contrasted, you will doubtless concur with US' in the opinion and con viction that it should be speedily liquidated. xnc ;aooi, it snouia do rcmcmucrea, is auu to many private citizens of the country, as well .as the soldier, who arc. as a general thing, in lira-" ited Circumstances, and many of them feel sensi bly the need Of their dues, having nobly como forth in the hour of need, and haviegmado great personal and pecuniary, 'sacrifices in, the public cause. And a large number of those claims are left in an informal condition from the fact that they had their horses, cattle, sheep, hogs and forage taken by raidinsrarmies' bothpy day.aud nignc ana inc owners laueu to ooiam me neces sary vouchers and memorandum rccei eipts the from the proper efficers These claims duo many hundreds of our Tennessee loyal citizens are for services rendered, and materials furnished, many of whom, by so doing, were left in a suffering condition. Men left families, de pending on their daily labor lor subsistence; farmers turned their horses loose from their ploughs in tho furrow and furnished them to the army for transportation, They have waited nearly five years and received, asyot.no remu ncaration for their property. Yourlmemoralist respcctly, but firmly, concicvo Ithat tho expen ses of tho war should be borno. by tho nation at. large, that it was a war fought in Self defense for the United States by the loyal people ofTen nessee. The timo lias comQ when-tineo. who spent their time.money and property in the'pros ecution of the lata war should be remunerated. The State of Tennessee U too woek to 'do it and meet the decands made upon her resources bv her growing interests. On our people's Dcnall we would carneruy pray you to make such provisions and. appropriations as will secure to tbem their does as speedi ly as they shall be properly authenticated. Your memorialists would further represent that they are confidently assured that they do no more than eitherthe universal opinion of Ameri can citizens here when they say they believe that the United States Government is solemnly bound, not only by a constitutional obligation, or of honor, but of virtual contract with the loyal citizens of Tennessee, which eubitnncc they give fpr the maintenance of our national flag and for tho protection of tho lives, rights and liberties of the American .people. Believing then as we do.'that simple justice demands in behalf of the people here, at the hand of the General Government, a payment as above: and being confidently assured that that Government which1 we are ever proud to call our own, will never so far forget the respect due to her own character to say nothing of the claims of hu manity as to refuse a simple act of justice to an enterprising and Eclf-dcvotcd few of her own ci tizens. To conclude, your memorialist respectfully but firmly pray your honorable body, at your present session, to appropriate and provide for the claimapts(broughtto your notice in tho fore going memorial, and on such other matters as our Keprcentativcs in Cong! may bring be fore you honorable body, you will perform acts of appropriate duty, and your memorialist will ever pray, etc., etc. Kesolvcd, by the General Assembly of th Slate of Tennessee, That our Senarors in Con gress oe instructed, and our Representatives re quested, to use their efforts and influence for the tiassaec of a law that will effect the earliest pos sible payment of loyal claims in the State of Tcnncjscc, as set forth and prayed for in tho foreirointr nreamble. Be it further enacted. That the Governor f this State be requested to forward to each of our members in Congress a copy of tno foregoing preamble and resolution. The Committee on Internal Improvements re ported in favor of the passage of House bill No. o!6 and Senate bill No. AU. The Committee on Finance and Ways "and Means submitted the following report: Tho Committco on Finance, and. Ways and Means, to whom was referred trtb memorial of five bundredcitizeus of the State, asking for the establishment of more ample provision for the destitute orphan population of the State, report the same to the Senate, with the bill, (No. 440.) and recommend its passage. Your committee would be false to their own sympathies and their sense of duty to the desti tute orphans of 'the. State,, whoso numberhaa been greatly'fncreased by tho events of tho post four year, to withhold this report. Tho orphans are truly the children of tho Ftate, and everywhere, all over the State, their hand'! are imploringly lifted, beckoning the Le gislature to-day to sympathize with, them in their loneliness and helpless and exposed con dition. In the past Tennessee has erectea'monnments to its beneficent legislation in its asylum for tho lunatic; its schools for deaf, dumb and blind. These institutions nre the pride of the State thcr nrorido liberallv for the unfartunate and helpless; and your committee would therefore urge on the Senate the" absolute necessity of giving expression to the sympathy they feel for the oruhan who. left all alon. naeds and hono- fully looks to the exercise of the parental care of the btate Government, tnat-tney suall noedc pend on the cold charity of tho world for sup port and guidance. The orphan needs moral and intellectual in struction, .ind his future usefulness and charac ter, and relations to society and theState, greatly depend on the liberal legislation in his behalf. Give to the orphan a jipine; asiuina, the Just obligations ot (lireeting tnc development oi nis religious and intellectual character and improve ment, and you will wipe away his tears, give iov to his heart, and cause him to feel unmeas ured gratitude for the liberality and wisdom of the Legislature.
