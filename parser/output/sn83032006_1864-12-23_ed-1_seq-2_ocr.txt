ffe fUdfutl BEDFORD, PA.. FRIDAY. DEC, 23, ) 864. THE ARMY VOTE AGAIN. The salutary silent workings of old Time, had almost effaced from our kind recollection, the Oc tober and November triumphs, achieved in great part by the many brave and scarrred veterans who love pur well, and who are voluntarily giv ing their lives for the preservation of our now di videdand distracted, but we hope soon, to be uni ted and happy country. Not that we did not suf ficiently appreciate their patriotism then, but true to themselves, they have been constantlyachieving greater deeds and winning rewcr and fresher lau rels to crown afresh their already well bedecked brows, casting into the shade the many gallant deeds ofa few months since. But if we had felt disposed to allow the past to wear into foigetful ness and to consider bygones to be bygones, we are compelled to take notice that k Lis not been so with our neighbor of the Gazette. The army vote, steals upon him like Banquos ghost and sadly dis turbs his equanimity, producing most admired disorder at every visitation. To the sad and bit ter misgivings of a guilty concience a e propose to offer a few words of explanatory consulation. The leaders of the opposition in the various dis tricts of which this county forms apart, Congress ional, Judicial and Legislative, fedt their inability to successfullyconduct the presiden tsal campaign un less they couldinduce their adherents to believe that they had successfully carried their candidates into the offices for which they were respectively run ning. Knowing that the act allowing soldiers to cast their ballots in the field, was coniparativelvnew and intricate, and that their must be errors commit ted, they, determined to avail themselves of all the the quibbles and technicalities of the law. They could not wait and test the matter before the courts or legislative bodies of the country, the proper and only tribunal, having jurisdiction over such cases but first, the prothonotaries, the officers authorized to receive and present the returns to the returnjudgeson the proper day of meeting, con stituted themselves judges of what they considered regular or irregular, legal or illegal returns, and secondly, the district return judges following in the same wake, constituted themselves similar tri bunals of judicial and legislative power and reject ed such soldiers votes as were not rejected by the prothonotaries, thus making a clear case of it- No lawyer has hesitated fe m instant to pro nounce the action of both prothonotaries and return judges illegal and without a shadow of foundation in law. There is not even a single precedent ap pearing in the books and nothing could justify the means, save the end at which they aimed, namely: the defrauding of the union candidates and the disfranchisment of the soldiers. To this high han ded and outrageous proceeding, the union men took exception and insisted upon the right of the soldiers to vote under the law and at the same time insisted that if there was any wrong done, it must appear from the beginning; that no one had any right to presume fraud, and upon such presump tion proceed to violate all the laws in the'land, up on the subject, as a remedy. This is a new theory. While the law abiding portion of the population contended correctly that the courts and legislative bodies were the only authorized tribunals to decide the matter and not self-constituted judges unknown to the law. The Gazette, contends because its friends succeed ed the in perpetrating a great wrong, after the casting of the ballots, that the party thus wronged should calmly give way without resorting to any precedent method of acquiring their rights anteri or to a contest before the tribunals authorized to hear and determine such cases. This is the sup plication of a mendicant. We ask for an execution of the law as it is understood by the courts and this will place these men where they ought legally to be. However, if our opponents will take advantage of the technicalities of the law theycertainly ought to allow us to have the advantage of a precedent established |by themselves in the same case. We contend that the only full and legal returns made were those made by Somerset county, and reject all others, the union candidates were duly elected to the positions to which they aspired. But the Gazette drops this point after a feeble effort to show that its party friends should not be made the contestants and proceeds to intimate that there were a great many fraudulent votes cast amongst the Bedford county soldiers. How the soldiers will bear this charge of dishonor and fraud we shall see. It says: ''Th? returns show that about 500 votes were polled in the army, by persons claiming to be citi zens of Bedford county. Somerset countv, with the same population as our own, polled but about 200, whilst rranklin, with nearly twice the popu lation of Bedford polled but about 300. Thus shows fraud on the very face of the army returns for this county. It is simply absurd to claim that Bedford countv had 500 votes in the army on the 11th of last October. Now, we happen to know that the Union coun ty Committee of Bedford count}' alone had at least 600 soldiera assessed for the October election and from 750 to 800 in all besides those who were asses sed by their friends, and that the names are now in the hands of the committee and if this is not satisfactory, the Gazette is well aware that the name of every individual who voted in the army from this county is now on file in the prothonota ry's office where it will have but little difficulty in ascertaining whether they are legal or not. The comparison made between other counties in the district is unfair. Does anybody suppose that Somerset had only 200 and Franklin 300 voters in the army on the Bth of October ? If the same ef ficient effort had been made in those counties that were made by the Union County Committee of this county their would have been a different re sult. Bedford county had at least 900 voters in the army and the evidence is not hard to get at The effort of the Gazette to impugn motives of the Union judges who could not be indnced to vi olate the laws of the Commonwealth which they sworn to execute, aud at the same time endeavor ing to place the responsibility of its rascality upon them, is a rare specimen of sophistry, and calcula ted to win forit an enviable position among soph ists. A 

PROSPECTUS of the Harrisburg Telepraph is given in another column. The Telegraph is an en terprising and wide awake paper, and usually con tains news a day later than the city papers. It is getting a very large circulation in thfe interior of the State. A CALL FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN. â€”The President has issued a call for three hundred thousand men. If the call is not filled within sixty days by volunteers, a draft will be made. Attorney General Meredith has filed an opinion in the case of Koontz and Coffrcth, deciding that neither has beed regularly returned, and both must bo omitted in the. Governor's Proclamation. The Late Victories. The New York Times of Monday, sums up Sherman's and Thomas' victories as follows: Official dispatches are not usually supposed to be a very fascinating or exhilarating kind of litera ture, but we venture to say that the people of this country never had a more agreeable chapter of his tory presented to them than will be found in to day's bulletin from the War Department. Sher man, by his own baud, sends news of conquest; Thomas sends news of triumph. Every line is lu minous with victory. The sententious, swelling sentences are every one rich with such spoils as the great soldier loves to lay at the feet of his coun try. The Secretary of War puts Sherman's dispatch first in order; but Thomas' stand* side by side with it in importance; and certainly the last is not least. Sherman's first sentence reports the capture of Fort McAllister with its garrison; the second the opening of Ossabaw Sound and communication with the fleet; and the third the investment of Savannah and the destruction of all the railroads leading to it. He then goes on to mention the splendid order of his army, asserting it to be equal to anything;" tells us that supplies were abupdant and his march most agreeable; that he was not at all molested by guerrillas; that he has not lost a wagon on the trip, and that his teams are in far better condition than when he started; that he has gathered large supplies of negroes, mules and horses; that he has destroyed over 200 miles of rails and consumed stores and provisions that were essential to Lee's and Hood's armies; that he has captured two boats on the Savannah river, and prevented the enemy's gunboats from coming down : and announces that he regards Savannah, which has a garrison of 15.000 men under Hardee and a population of 15,000, as "already gained." Thus, in a few words, Sherman brushes a thousand rebel lies, and proves his great campaign to be a consumate success. The news from Gen. Thomas concerning the great battle which he opened at Nashville, at 9 clock on Thursday morning last, which he carried on victoriously to the close of the week, and which is probably still in progress, is also of a most glo rious character. As the result of the three days' operations, he had pressed the enemy from before Nashville, and away downbelow Franklin, and the number of rebels mentioned in the various dis patches'as taken prisoners is not short of ten thou sand, or a larger number than has been taken in any field engagement in the war, so far as we at present recall. We understand Hood's entire army to have numbered about 40,000, and if to the prisoners we add those killed and otherwise put hor* du combat , it will seen what havoc has been made with Hood's army, and will furnish justifi cation for the remark that it is completely demor alized. We did not at first imagine that Gen. Thomas would be able to make pursuit for a very great distance ; but his latest dispatch announces he is pushing beyond Franklin. The notable cav alry leader, Forrest, the best cavalry officer in the rebel army, is also reported killed by Gen. Rous seau at Murfreesboro. We think it is evident, from the dispatches of Gen. Sherman and Gen. Hood, that out of Vir ginia the military power of the Southern Confed eracy is now pretty well broken up. THE ST. 

ALBANS RAIDERS RELEASED.â€” The Miner 1 s Journal says: The public mind of this country was startled this week by the announce ment that the Court at Montreal, Canada, before which the St. Albans raiders had been carried has ordered their release, and, accordingly, they have been set free. Comment upon such a proceeding as this seems superfluous, and it is impossible to avoid an expression of indignant reprobation.â€” These men deliberately planned in Canada a bold and daring raid into a peaceable town, remote from proximity to rebel territory, and in a position where if any armament of ours had been placed to protect the border it would have been regarded as a menace to the British Provinces. This de cision gives to the rebel refugees in these Provinces perfect impunity to plan and execute raids and outrages of every description upon our border towns. Luckily, our government last October gave the required notice for the termination of the reciprocity treaty, and we mav now take measures to insure our frontier against outrages. We do not question that Mr. Seward will handle this new matter with his accustomed ability. It cannot we think, be possible that the English Government will defend the action of the British judge in dis charging thirteen robbers, who have committed the most heinous offences against international and criminal law. If it does we may think serious ly of protecting our frontier from similar incursions in the future. THAT staunch old patriot, Glen. Bix, who when national chaos seemed to have come, ordered the first man to be shot who dared to haul down the American flag, has just issued an order in relarion to raiders from Canada, in view of the discbarge of the St. Albans rascals, instructing commanders on on the frontier, in case of further depredation!, by persons acting under commissions from the rebel authorities, to shoot down the perpetrators, or, if necessary to cross the Canada line to capture them and in no case are the priaoners to be surrendered, but are to be sent to headquarters for triad by court martial. That is right. If British judges are to be permitted to release murderers and thieves, men who depredate our frontier towns, we must protect ourselves, and the Government of Great Britian will find us prompt, unless it dis avows the act of Mr. Justice Coursal of Montreal in discharging thirteen scoundrels who invaded St. Albans. We are glad to see that Congress is moving in the matter of frontier protection. Since the above has been put in type, we notice that the President has disapproved of the order of Gen. Bix, and caused it to be rescinded. THE NEW 

YORK Times. â€”This journal is not so well known in the rural districts of this part of the State, as soif e others longer before the public, and we may therefore say a word to our readers of its merits. The Times from its commencement, took a foremast position among the leading jour nals of the country and still sustains it The editor, Hon. Henry Jr Raymond, enjoys a well earned re putation throughout the whole country, for poltical abilities of a high order, and rare qual ifications in other respects as an editor. Should any of our leaders want a New York paper, they will, we feel sure, find the Times on the whole, per haps the very best one they can select. For terms see advertisen rent in another colninn. THE FORCES, EN THE FIELD.â€” The Army and Navy Journal , which is very high authority on all military matter!<, computes the forces which the rebels now have in the field at a very moderate figure. Hood's army, now in Tennessee, is esti mated at 35,000. Early' s force in the Shenandoah Valley is set down at less than 15,000, and Lee's as less than 50.000. These figures amount in the total to 100,000. The forces with which Price re cendv invaded Missouri, and the gairisons of Charles town, Savannah and Mobile, and a few Other points, may swell the aggregate to 175,000, ONE OF THE JRJWULTS.â€” The abolition of Slavery in Maryland is being attended with the good re sults the friends of Emancipation expected. A steady stream of emigrants from our sister States, particularly Pennsylvania, is i>ouring in upon us, now that "free labor" has become a settled faci - In every county of the State large sales of land have taken place during the past two months, and the purchasers are men who intend to setttle in our midst, and who do not purchase for the sake of speculation. The worn-out and half tilled tracts of the large slaveholder, in the hands of farmers who till their grounds by free labor â€”who eucour age free schools, and all the accompaniments of of free institutionsâ€”will soon place Maryland in position among the Free States that she should have occupied long ago. The following, from the Denton Union, published in Caroline County, is an indication of the revolution taking place. Mr. James G. Redden has sold his farm, near town, containing near three hundred acre* to Mr. Jacob L. Zook, of Cumberlaud county, Pa., for $9,000. It is a healthy and desirable residence. Mr. Redden has also sold the. "Mansion Farm" formerly the residence of the late'Wm. Jones, near Andersontown, to Mr. J. W. Kline, of Cumber land county, Pa., but at what at what price wo have not learned. Mr. Redden has also sold his Burrsville farm, near the Deleware line, to Mr. Tobias Miller, of Cumberland county Pa., co ntaining one hundred acres, for 3,500. We have always understood that the land in Caroline is among the poori sst in the Btate, and believe that the prices above specified arc remark ably good. The Union , in commenting the above sales says : "We would advise all persons, wheth er residents here or elsewhere who wish to pur chase farms in this county, to do so speedily, be fore the price of lands go up. They are cheap at present, but how long they will remain so, now that Maryland is a Free State, no one can tell."â€” The Somerset Herald, in an extract which we published yesterday, says that more land is wanted Northerners continue to visit this county (Somer set), looking for farms." WeL l may the President say that "the genious of rebellion will no more claim Maryland." That day is gone forever.â€” Baltimore Ameri can. THE 

CHIEF JUSTICE.â€”Even the New York World, one of the most bitter opposition organs, commends the appaintment of Chief Justice Chase although we think it misrepresents the President, by saying that nothing could have in duced him to make the appointment but an inti mation from the Senate that it would reject an other name sent in for the post. The World says: "Mr. Chase is a grave, thoughtful, deliberate man given to no crotchets but such" as he shares in common with his party, and capable of that steadiness of conviction which betokens a firm sense of justice. His political opinions, or the like of them, we should have bad in any appoint ment which Mr. Lincoln would make or the pres ent Senate confirm. We are glad to see so fitting a tribute to the importance of that high office as the appointment of the ablest man in the Repub lican party (for such we hold Mr. Chase to be) to fill it THE 

CANADIANS FRIGHTENED. â€”The illegal and hostile act of Judge Coursal of Canada in releasing criminals guilty of assailing the sovereignty of this country at St. Albans. Vt., has beeri so enforced upon the Canadian mind by the anger our people and the remonstrances of our government that the Judge is about to be dismissed, and % special meet ing of Parliament summoned. Hie Provincial Cabinet had an extraordinary sessioi, and deeided to try and catch the criminals. HOJ tility towards the rebels has replaced love, since love threatened war. The Nation"* CiH. From the Tribune. President Lincoln has most wise ly and properly called for three hundred thousa ad men to fin ish up the work of restoring the National authori ty over every square mile of the B epublic. Those who affect to be surprised or disappointed by this call only betray their chagrin at the now manifest failure of their reiterated and eon fident predictions that the Rebellion never would n ever could be put down. Never before, in twice the time, was such progress made in the work as during the six weeks that have elapsed since Mr. Lincoln's re election. THE WAR FOR THE 

UNION. OFFICIAL DISPA TCH FROM GEX. THOMAS. The Enemy Pressed at aU Points in I lis Line of Retreatâ€”lmmense Captures of Guns and Prisonersâ€”The Enemy Out manoeuvred and Taken by Surprise. WAR DEPARTMENT. \ WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 â€”8:35 A. M. j Major- General John A. Dir. : The following official Report of the great victory achieved yesterday by Major- General Thomas and his gallant army over the rebel forces unuer Gen. Hood in front of Nashville, was received this mor ning. One of the most surprising eircuinstances connected with the great achievement is the small loss suffered by our troops, evincing, among other things, the admirable skill and caution of Gen. Thomas in his disposition of the battle. In our rejoicings at the defeat of the enemy, thanks are ; due to the Almighty for his protection to our gal -1 lant officers and soldiers in the great conflict they have passed through. The report of Gen. Thomas, and also an unoffi cial report containing interesting details are sub joined : HD. QR. DEPARTMENTAETHE CUMBERLAND, } BIGHT MILES FROM NASHVILLE, > 6 P. M! Friday, Dec. 16, 1864. J To the President of the United States, Ifon. Ed win M. Stantonâ– , Lieut.-Gen, U. S. Grant : This army thanks you for your approbation of Its conduct yesterday, and to assure you that it is not misplaced, I have the honor to report that the enemy has been pressed at all points to-day, in his line of retreat to the Bentwood Hills. Brig.-Gen. Hatch, of Wilson's corps of cavalry, on the right, turned the enemy's left, and captur ed a large number of prisoners, the number not yet reported. Maj.-Gen. Schofield's corps, next on the left of cavalry, carried several hills, captured many pris oners and six pieces of artillery. Brevet Major Gen. Smith, next on the left of Maj.-Gen. Scho field, carried the salient point of the enemy's line with McMillan's brigade of McArthur's division, capturing 16 piecesof artillery, two Brigadier-Gen erals and about 2,000 prisoners. Brig.-Gen. Ger rard's division, of Smith's command, next on the left of McArthur's division, carried the enemy's intrenchments, capturing all the artillery and troops of the enemy on the line. Brig.. Gen. Wood's troops on Franklin pike took up the assault, cap turing the enemy's intrenchments, in his retreat captured eight pieces of artillery, something over 600 prisoners, and drove the enemy within one mile of the Brentwood Hill Pass. Maj.-Gen. Stedinan, oommanding detachments of the different armie3 of the Military Division of the Mississippi, most nobly supportedGenWood's left, and bore a most honorable part in the ojiera tions of the day. I have ordered the pursuit to be continued in the morning at daylight, although the troops are very much fatigued. The utmost enthusiasm prevails. I must not forget to report the operations of Brig.-Gen. Johnson in suocess fully drivlr tg the enemy, with co-operation of the gunboats under Lieut.-Commander Fitch, from their estu Mushed batteries on the Cumberland Riv er, uelow the City of .Nashville, and of the success oi Brig.- Gen. Coition's brigade in coveringand re turning our right and, rear.* In the operations of yesterday and to-day. although I have no report of the n utnlter of prisoners captured by Johnson's and Croxton's command, I know they have made a large number. lam also glad to be able to state that th e number of prisoners captured yesterday greatly exeee.L the number reported by telegraph last evening. The wood's, .elds and intrehehmcnts are strewn with the enemy's small arms abandon ed in the retreat. In csoneiusion, lam happy to state, that all this has been effected with but very siurj] loss tin us. Our loss probably does not ex ceed three thousand and very lew killed. GKO. H. 

THOMAS, Maj.-Gen. Commanding. NASHVILLE. Teun., Friday, Dec. 16â€”9 P. M. During last night, Hood withdrew his right from the river, and took a position covering Hillsboro, Granny white and Franklin pikes, which line had been carefully prepared for just this contingency. He was driven from the first line easily, but the second was very stubbornly defended, and at last heavily assaulted three times before succeeding.â€” It wao carried, however, and twenty pieces of ar tillegy, two thousand men, including Gen. Jack son, with the remnant of his. division, were taken. The enemy were forced back two miles, and his arm:; broken into parts, one on the white pike and the ether on the Franklin, with range of Bluffy Hills between them, Stodman and Wood pressing down the latter, and A. J. Smith, Schofield anu the cavalry down the former. Small arms lay as thick on the contested line as the rebels had stood there. Hood can't make another such day's fight, while Thomas is in good condition to press him. Caught more wagons. Can't say number. Ev erybody, white and black, did splendidly. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War. SECOND DISPATCH. WAR DEPARTMENT. 1 WASHINGTON, Dec. 17â€”10 P. M. J To Mnj.-Gen. John A. Dix : Nothing has been heard from Gen. Thomas to day. Unofficial dispatches state that the Provost Marshal at Nashville reports 5,000 prisoners and 49 pieces of' artillery as being already secured. It is ascertained tliatin transmitting Gen. Thom as' report last night, a telegraphic mistake was made at Louisville or Nashville in the estimated number of our casualties. The dispatch written by Gen. Thomas stated that his whole loss would not exceed 3,000, and that very few were killed. A dispatch from Lexington, this evening, states that on the 13th inst., at Kingsport, Tenn, Gen. Burbridge had a fight with Basil Duke's brigade, formerly John Morgan's, and routed it, with a loss to the enemy of one hundred and fifty killed, wounded and prisoners, and their train. Dick Morgan, a brother of John, was captured. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War. FROM GENERAL, SHERMAN. Au official dispatch from General Sherman was received at the war Department, last Sundaydated near midnight, December 13th, on the gunboat Dandelion. Ossabaw Sound Georgia. It was writ ten before General Foster had reached him. He reports besides some military details of future op erations which are omitted, the following particu lars of his operations : ON BOARD "DANDELION," OSSABAW SOUND. 11.50 P. M., Dec. 13, 1864.â€”T0-day. at 5 P. M., General Hazen'e Division of the Fifteenth Corps carried Fort McAllister by aâ€”ault. capturing its entire garrison and stores. This opened to us the Ossabow Sound, and I pulled down to this gun boat to communicate with the fleet. Before open ing communication we had completely destroyed all the railroads leading into Savannah and invest ed the city. The left is on the Savannah River, three miles above the city, and the right is on the Oyoechee, at King's Bridge. â€¢ The army is in splendid order, and equal to any thing. The weather has been fine and supplies abundant. Our march was most agreeable, and we were not all molested bv guerillas. We reached Savannah three days ago. but owing to Fort Mc- Allister we couid not communicate, but now we have McAllister, and go ahead ! We have already captured two boats in the Sa vannah river, and have presented the gunboats from coming down. I estiijgPe the population of Savannah at twenty-five thousand, and the gar rison at fifteen thousand. General Hardee com mands. We have not lost a wagon on the trip, but have gathered a large supply of mules, negroes, horses Ac., and our teams at * in far better condition then when we started. My first duty will be clear th" army of all sur plu negross, mules and horses. We have utterly destroyed over two hundred miles of railroad, and consumed stores and provisions that were essential to Lee's and Hood's urn lies. _ The quick work nmde of Fort McAllister, and the opening of communication with our fleet, and consequent independence of supplies, dissipates all their boasted threats to head me off and starve the army. I regard Savannah as already gained Yours, trulv, ' W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General. Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Sect'y of War.

RAUSDKLI., Oil City, Pa. â€¢ The property of this Company consists of 200 acres of land, in fee simple, situated on the west aide of the Alle gheny river, a short distance above 'he mouth of Scrub Grass Creek, in Scrub Gross Township, Venango county, 1 Po. It has a frontage along the river of one mile, with [ good boring surface for the whole distance. Two good oil wells are now iu operation on the east tide of tho river, ; immediately opposite the property of the Co. i The following in regard to an adjoining tract, is taken from an editorial in the Philadelphia Price Current, ot , December IT: "The geological relation of this property to Oil Creek, is such that the oil-bearing strata, which supply the wells 1 on the Middle Section of Oil Creek (from the Washington MeClintoek Farm on the north to the Buchanan on the South) must pass under this property: the range of the - strata certainly bringing the two localities into this mutu al relation. Other data, obtained from an investigation t of the conformation of the ground, and the underlying rocks, lead to the same conclusion, vis: that the main belt of oil. which extends down from the north-northeast and supplies the wells on the Washington, MeClintoek, Egbert. Stone, Tar, and Buchanan Farms, sweeps down still fanher on the same south southwest direction, cor responding with and controlled by the inclination of the strata, and underlies this property. It is well ascertain ed by the testimony of aged and respectable residents that the Indians, years ago, gathered oil from the surface of â€¢ the ravines on this property and used it for rheumatic af fections. In later times the teamsters of Bullion Iron Furnace, gathered aud used the oil for the puspose of applying it to galls and bruises on their horses. Oils for years was seen , to exude at a number of places; among others, at the root , of an old stump on the bank of the Allegheny river, and in the ravine alluded to. 1 A few years ago, the then owners of (he tract, with one or two of their neighbors, bored a well, a few feet above the old stump. The first vein of oil was struck at the i depth of 256 feet, and the second at 46U feet: an experien > eed man from Oil Creek was employed to tube the well, which produced a stream of oil three quarters of an Inch â–  in diameter. The owners of the well, not satisfied with . its production, pulled out the chamber, and drilled some feet deeper, when they struck salt water in large quantities and of great strength. Believing that the man ufacture of salt would, at the time, yield them a better profit, they arranged their seed bags in the well, so as to ' enable them to exclude the oil and pump the salt water. ' Still oil was pumped along with the water, in such quan i tities as to gather upon the top of the water-tanks, from whence it was collected, barreled and sold." There is every reason, therefore, to believe that the pro perty of the Company is rich in its supplies of oiL The inclination of the Strata proves, conclusively, that those supplies of oil on Oil Creek have a higher level than the oil-bearing rocks on this property; and that, consequently, the supply will be more pertnournt than that of Oil Creek itself. The large extent of boring territory, equal to that of half a dozen companies on Oil Creek, a boat-landing on the Farm, with the advantage of a navigable stream for the transportation of oil, and the certainty of tho exis tence of large quantities of coal upon the tract, makes tho property of incalculable value. The Company are about preparing to sink several wells, and confidently expect the early development of oil in paying quantities. The plan of organization adopted by the Company com mends itself to public approval, from the fact that it'places no fictitious value upon its stock, but confines the sale of shares strictly to their par value.
