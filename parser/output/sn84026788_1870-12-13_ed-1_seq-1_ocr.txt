THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. W e bad intended tu lay before our readers the entire message of the President of tho United States, which was read in Congress on Monday of Jast week ; but upon its reception we find it so weak a document?so utterly void of anything like statesmanship?that we deem it unworthy tha space it would occupy in out journal, and therefore only copy the follow in" comment!) of the Baltimore Gazette.; It is thoroughly Radical in its leanings, and, in its relerctlces to taxation, thoroughly protectionist. Following close upon customa ry allusion to "a kind Providence," comes the lying declaration that "in several of tile Status lately in thu rebellion the citizens have been denied, by vioieuce and intimidation, the free exercise or tbe elective franchise, and that the verdict of the people has thereby been re versed." Reference is then made to the progress of Reconstruction, and the restora tion of ail the States to representation iu Con gress, with the exception of Georgia. But tho latter, it is expected, will also take her place there at the beginning of the next year. The obligation of the whole people to pay the public debt, '"as the price of our Union," is next touched upon, and when this obliga tion is acquiesced iu, and also the payment of penaions, &e., &c . the President is good enough to say that he sees no reason why the country should not advance in happiness and prosperity. After this we have a glorification of what the United States have done?whilst pursuing a prescriptive policy at home?in protect ill!;, through Air. \Vashbunie, at Parts, the subjects and citizens of half a dozen other countries. The prompt recognition of tho Committee of National Defence as the j tic facto Government!)!' France is also regarded as a proper subject for the felicitations of Americans." On the subject of intervention in the Franco-German quarrel, the liie*s;i"0 states that the United States have adhered to their traditional policy, not, however, be- j cause it was traditional, but because Prussia was indisposed to listen to representations j from any of the neutral Powers, and therefore, I ll.e stops would not have advanced the ob jects fur which intervention was invoked. In regard to the Cuban insurrection, we are ! informed that there has been no material change iu the condition of the eountrv since the close of the last session of Oorisres'. So fir as the arbitrary proceedings of the Spanish authorities have ufleclcd the persons and prop erty of American citizens, they have been made the subject of complaint at Madrid, but nothing, as yet, has been done iu the way of redress. Neither have the good offices of the United j States for the promotion of peace between Spain and the allied South American Repub ' :i;'s resulted iu accomplishing mirthing. IJtit the President is sati.-fi,d that all the Republics of Spanish origin ought to be intensely trrate j I'll for tiie friendly interest in their welfare which the United Statis have shown by this e't .rt, although it has proven abortive. Tho I 'resident next fakes up the subject of the annexation of San Bouiingo: regrets that the Bahcock treaty was rejected; is thoroughly convinced that the best interest of this couti try demands its ratification, and proceeds, in a glnwitiL' strain, to depict tho wonderful fer tility of the soil of the Dominican half of that Isl and, and the extraordinnrv commercial ad vantages that will accrue to us from its tins session. The whole of this portion of the message is full of fine oriental coloring, and the enthusiasm that eives warmth to the im aginative powers of the writer indicates how deeply Gen Grant?or the speculators among whom tbe Island has been parcelled t ut by Bnez? feel the importance of the acquisition, and the pecuniary solace they would derive from it. hollowing San Domingo, the message touches briefly upon the I'ree Z'me of Mex ico ; extradition ttra'ies; the Chinese mas sacre ; the abolition i-f mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade ; the rati fication of the Naturalization Convention with t.reat Britain, and the discovery of the remarkable f?et that the true boundary line between the United States and the British possessions, on the Bed river of the North, is 4 700 feet north of the line, as commonly re ceived. in regard to the Alabama claims, tbe Pres ident legrets Ih-? t no conclusion has been reached for their adjustment?the British Government, not being willing to concede that it wn? auilty of negligence. lie suggests that the United States shall buy up the claims of private parties, and hold them until such time as a full and friendly settlement can be made with the Government of Great Britain. I he recent action of tho Canadian authori ties. in capfiinritr American fi-hinsr vessels in what are alleged to be Canadian waters, is more boldly discussed, and bears evident marks of Mr. B. F. Butler's handiwork. The Ca nadians are warned that if they attempt to enforce tbe jurisdiction conferred by their own statutes over the waters in question, it will be come necessary, on the part of tbe President, "to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the United States." Moreover, as a further means of re taliation, iu case the Canadian authorities ''re peat, the comin<r season. their nnneighborly acts upon our fishermen." the President asks Congress to confer upon him the power to prohibit the transit of goods, wares and mer chandise. in bond, across the territory of the United States to Canada, and to prohibit any vessels belonging to Canadian citizens from entering the waters of the United States. Another complaint is the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition on the part of the Canadian authorities in refusing to American vessels the free and unrestricted navigation of the river St. Lawrence, which", it is arsrued. the latter have the ri<rht to enjoy, notwith standing the fact that the river runs, for the greater portion of its length, through Canadian territory. Tbe subject "of oar depressed commerce" is dismissed in a short paragraph. As we have lost our European commerce, the President finds some consolation in the fact that the carrying trade between the Pacific States and ; China and Japan is actually conducted in American vessels?the trade being limited to one line of ste*tners. In consideration of this fortunate circumstance, he recommends that Congress show towards the line in question '-a liberal policy." Ii> other words, that a subsidy shall he granted in a ease where for eign competition is virtually excluded. The President acknowledges that, on this side of the continent, American vessels cannot be profitably run; that wo cannot successfully build iron steamers without granting the ship owners Government assistance, and proposes, at some period later in the session, to lay be fore Conjure."!-suggestions "looking to a remedy for this evil." Of the financial policy of the Government, the message takes, not merely a cheerful, but a positively jolly vie'w. The premium on gold has been reduced, and the approach to a specie currency?still very remote, however?is said to be very gratifying. Unhappily, it is admit ted that this gratification is dashed with gloom; (or we are told ?quite truthfully this titr.e ? that "the instability of the value of our cur rency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keep up prices, to the detriment of trade." The action of congress, is, therefore, invoked toset this "prejudicial" matter right. One thing, however, the message declaro3 has been done during the past year?taxation has been reduced uiore than eighty millions of dollars. The prospect also is benvolently held out of dispensing with the tax collector alto gether in the course of a few years, if the peo ple will only consent to their own impoverish ment in the meanwhile by paying the tribute exacted for the protection ofspccial monopolies. The new movement in favor of revenue refotm is dismissed with a sneer, ar.d the old argument of the necessity of protecting American labor against the pauper labor of Kurope?thread bare us it is. and false as it is in its restricted application?is made to do servica once more in the interest of the Pennsylvania iron-mas tors the eastern manufacturers, and the salt monopolists of On ondaga. The remainder of the message is taken up with a review of the Department reports, and is of no importance. The message concludes with what is called a summing up of the policy of the Administration, which it declares to be '?a thorough cuforcement of every law;" a faithful collection ol the tuxes and economy in their disbursement; a reduction of taxation, as soon as circumstances permit; reform in the treatment of the Indians and in the civil service, and a determination to secure "a pure, untrammelled ballot, without (ear of molesta tion." Nothing is said about the presence of Federal agents, backed by the bayonets of the military, at the recent elections?bnt we are told there shall henceforth be "no proscrip tion on account ol political faith, nativity or color." Nevertheless, it seems to be under stood that Federal officials must vote the Rad ical ticket or sufTer decapitation, as they did in Missouri. This, however, is. by no means, what the Radicals would call "proscription." It is simply obliging men to act virtuously, according to the gospel of G rant, and the crccd of Chandler, Cameron and Butler. Deferred Items.

Albert Elsea, who oceur>ics a farm on the east side of the Sheu andoah, opposite the Tilthammer mill, a few days ago, butchered twelve hogs, sixteen months and seven days old, all littered and raised by oue sow, which weighed 4.DOS lbs.; ?making an average of 400 lbs. to the hog.? At the same time he butchered 13, eleven month* old, which averaged 240 lbs; The hogs had been raised and fed as farm hogs, not as pets. The first lot were Chester crossed on Berkshire; the last may have been the aame, but we are not informed.? Clarice. Courier. The Virginia Mother.?We shall uever forget that woman.
