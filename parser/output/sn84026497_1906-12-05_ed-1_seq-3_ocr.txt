THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. 4. t. WINK, . Editor 4 Proprietor. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1906. Mr. Hearst reports that he paid f25rt, 370 for running second to Hughes. By the way add 2, 5, 6, 3, 7, 0. It's an open secret now that Peary named bis Arctic ship Roosevelt because it was designed to cut ice. "Tammany Hall nerer lost anything In a tight for principle," says Richard Croker. You bet it never did. It never was iu that kiud of a iigbl. Skckktary Bonaparte wants to re duce the number of rich men in the country, but he can get more votes on a proposition to reduce the number of poor men. Accorpinu to an eastern critic the English language is "violent, illogical, chaotia and absurd." Rut this opinion was written when the Democratic orators were in full blast. Of course, eminent persons may theo rize about matrimony, but the little winged god knows full well that when a couple has that waut-to-get-married feel ing It is a condition aud not a theory that confronts them. Somkbodv advertises "the new apple butter." A screw must be loose some where when an apple crop is said to be so large that the owuers of the orchards are compelled to sell tor less than cost. With proper management not a bushel of apples would be wasted. But the apple trust method is to pay a miserable pit tance for the wholesome fruit that every body wants, and then demand a profit of not less than 200 or 300 per cent. Just now the disgruntled Democratic and Fusion newspapers are telling their readers how the awful Republican ma chine is going to do things at the ap proaching session of the legislature. Tbey pretend to bave been taken into the confidence of the Republican leaders, and their statements of how this or that man is to run the Senate and this or that man the House bave all the ear marks of the political pipe dreams of the campaign.' At the approaching session of the legis lature the bill to authorize the publica tion of the session laws in a sufficient number of newspapers in each county, as is done in New York, will again be introduced. This measure has the in dorsement of the press and the people all over the state and is almost certain to be come a law. The present method of pub licity of the acts of the General Assembly is too restricted to satisfy tbe people who are affected and tbey demand tbe New York law. With the increasing enact ment of laws regulating food products, tbe dairy and farm, the killing of game and the catching ot tish, tbe trespassing upon lands and similar laws, it is abso lutely necessary that efticiont publicity be given so that the people may not be Ignorant of and Innocently violate laws of the Commonwealth. Hairisburg Tel egraph. A few of the figures taken from statis tics just completed will serve to show that the American farmer is away at the top of the Leap in tbe matter of the value of his products, which for the year 1906 reached tbe Bum of $6,791,000,000, ex ceeding tbe figures or 1905 by $185,000,000. Of grain he raised 

4,6S8,0OO,00O bushels, 120,000,000 bushels above tbe output of last year. From the surplus of his products be exported $978,000,000 worth. It was tbe banner year for exports and be loaded tbe ocean fleets with products, tbe value of which, It is computed, would be eDough to build a high-class railroad half way around the earth. He secured a national credit In the world's balance sheet in favor of this nation of $433,000, 000. Other American producers, all told, got a credit only of ?S5,000,000. These are interesting figures. The American farmer is the greatest producer on earth and the millions of people whom he feeds must take oil' their hats to him, tbiuks the Oil City Blizzard. Congress in Session. The present Congress, which met Mon day for its last session, will have all its business to finish by March 3. The "short session" of a Congress is often the period of important legislation. The resumption act was passed at such a session thirty-two years ago. The revis ion of the national bank act was secured in a short session in 181, The tariff of 1883 was passed at the close of the life of the Congress which enacted it. But in each of these cases the previous election bad chosen a House opposed to the party In tbe majority in the chamber. The legislation passed bad behind it the pressure exerted by a desire to forestall legislation by the opposing party. Where no such a motive exists Con gress Is not apt to pass any new farreach ing legislation in ten or eleven weeks, which is all the time for business the short session offers. Tbe next House will be Republicau like the present. It will, in all human probability, have the same Speaker. Tbe same men will have charge ol the leading committees. Past experience shows that under these conditions new legislation or important measures are not crowded forwaid. The issues covered by the railroad rate act, 'the pure food act and tbe meat Inspection act will certainly be untouched. Thee measures must have their test, Meas ures which have come over from the last session on current ivsues will be taken up, out me appropriation Dills Have a way of taking a great deal of time at the short session. President Roosevelt's recomtnenda' tions in his message will receive full consideration and debate. Bills will be Introduced and pressed. The country will be educated, agitated and awakened to new issues and new questions. This will all bear fruit in the next Con gress, Just as the rsfusal of tbe Senat f act In the short session of the last "Con gress ou railroad rebates brought a much more radical act last June than could have been passed two years ago. This Congress will debate, so far as any new Issue is concerned, in its short session The next Congress will act in Its long session. Puila. Press. The President's Message. Ptesident Roosevelt's annual message to Congrecs is full of meat aud good, sound logic, as usual. Like all bis state papers it Is a document of absorb! i g in terest, touching vigorously as It does on all the great national issues before the American people. We give it on the fint page of the paper today, and we have no doubt every subscriber will read It with profound Interest. Mr. Wheeler's Campaign Expenses, Up to tbe present date Congressman elect Wheeler is the ouly candidate to file an account of bis expenditures in tbe recent campaign with the Forest county Prolhonotary. Messrs. Brown, Detar, and Hoovler, having had no expense, or at least kept them under tbe f "0 mark, are not required to tile accounts.

The other items were for printing, traveling expenses, etc. Pennsylvania Oil Field. The Derrick, in its oil report for the month of November, says: Iu "the sections producing high grade oil, which include the petroleum regions of Pennsylvania, New York, West Vir ginia and Southeastern Ohio, tbere were 617 wells completed In November, In cluding 55 gassers and 120 dry boles, while the new production1 amounted to only 3,615 barrels. This was a decline from October of 61 wells completed and 13 barrels new production, with a gain of three dry boles. The October record was 67S wellB completed, 3,628 barrels pro duction and 175 dry boles and gas wells. On the last of November tbe Pennsyl vania oil fields contained 253 rigs and 489 drilling wells, which was a gain of nine rigs over the figures for October 31. Tbe drilling wells were (he same for both months. Field operations at the close of October were composed of 244 rigs and 489 wells drilling, which was a decline of 21 rigs and 11 wells drilliug from tbe fig ures on September 30. On September 30 tbe uew work under way consisted of 215 rigs aud 500 wells drillirg. Home Sweet Home. Stay, stay at home, my heart aud rest; Homeseeklng hearts are happiest. For those that wander tbey kuow not where. Are full ol trouble and full of care. To stay at home is best. Home tbe name made dear by sacred associations, tbe place where childish feet take their first faltering steps aud infant minds receive their first ideas, Tbere lessons of love and tiuth, of right and wrong, ot faith and hopo and purity are imprinted upon tbe plastic bearl, and all tbe sorrows and perplexities of afterlife are inefficient to quite efface these first deep true impressions. Sweet home where the mother's gentle bands prepare the little domestic comforts thatafathei'a love provides, and filial affection is "tbe silver link, the silken tie" that binds tbe household band together. Trials may come and clouds may lower, but in tbe seclusion of home remains sweet healing for the wounds that brave and sensible hearts bide from a disdaiuful world. There these hurts and distresses may be confidently revealed and a sovereign remedy found in its unquestioned faltb. There a child's pure kiss or the touch of dimpled fingers may revive a soul on tbe verge of despair; and in tbe borne tbe brightest dreams become more golden, tbe rarest pleasure more Intense, the tenderest joys more serene. And if, in the varyiug decrees of fortune, its loving shelter must be abandoned, how the exilo folds about bis heart, as tbe traveler does his cloak, tbe memory of its lights and flowers, Its loves and hopes and kindnesses. Tbere the noblest influences exist, tbe holiest impulses find expres sion, and tbere bave neon born the chaste and lofty sentiments that bave made a whole world better.

In tlio first months of the Russia-Japan war we had a striking example of tbe ne cessity for preparation and tbe early ad vantage of those who, so to speak, "have shingled their roofs in dry weather." The virtue of preparation has mado history and given to us our greatest men. Tbe individual as well as tbe nation should be prepared for any emergency. Are you prepared to successfully combat the first cold you take? A cold can be cured much more quickly when treated as soon as it has been contracted and before it has become settled in tbe system.

Marjy pcoplo suppose that moonlight possesses great potency and has a won derful Influence on or over animate and Inanimate things ou our planet Such persons should remember that moonlight is only reflected sunlight and that the quality and quantity of the light thus reflected lire not what is generally Imagined. In fact, It Is a truth which has often been demonstrat ed by the speculative astronomers that it would take G1S.000 full moons to afford au amount of light equal to that emitted by the sun, aud, furthermore, tbere. Is only sky space for 73,000 such disks. Some heat cornea from moon light. However, It Is In quantities so small that It cnunot bo measured by ordinary Instruments. Flamnmrlou says that the amount of heat emitted by a full moon while at Its zenith can not be more than one eighty-thousandth of the amount that the sun sup plies when standing ou the meridian ou a favorable day in July. Such be ing the ease, It Is really surprising that Intelligent people should consider that the moon lias such a wonderful "influence" over terrestrial affairs. The Rhinoceros Bird. Among the birds not commonly found Is the; rhinoceros bird, from tbe Trans vaal. RufTel plkker Is Its Dutch name. Its habits arc remarkable and Its plum age unusual. Small flocks accompany most of the large antelopes, the buffa loes and the rhinoceroses In South Af rica and run all over the creatures' bodies, picking off files and Insects. When an enemy approaches the buffel plkkers sit In n line with heads raised ou the back of the animal they are at tending, like sparrows on a roof ridge, and signal "the enemy In sight." The plumage Is curiously close, uniform and compact, so much so that the bird has an artificial look, as If covered with painted satin and not with feathers. Tbe general tint of the body Is cinna mon brown, with yellow beak and legs, giving the rolor effect of a brown and yellow Iris. A "Turner" Story. Very few London dealers Indeed are competent to Judge Turner's works that Is, without a certified history. A lady acquaintance of mine had a large picture In her house which she had al ways regarded as a Turner, and, desir ing to sell It. she offered It to five or six of the leading dealers, but not one of them would buy It at any price, as serting that Turuer never saw it and that It was nothing like his work, and so on. A few months afterward a doc ument turned up among her family pa pers showing that the picture had been specially painted by Turner for her husband's father, and In a week she had sold the work for 2,250. The av erage dealer Is almost frightened to touch a Turner, and you seldom or nev er Bee one exposed for sale In tbe gal leries. Chambers' Journal. Onr Foolish Alphabet. Why, think of It!

Color and Aroma of Coffee. There aro two things which people Imagine are guides to the goodness of coffee which are really of no conse quence whatever. They are the color of the decoction and tbe aroma of tbe coffee when ground or as it escapes from the pot in drawing. The color is due almost entirely to the roasting. This is true also of tea. The finest coffees and teas, when properly roast ed aud prepared, to give out their finest flavors will color the water but little. Tbe real essences which give the flavor have practically no color. Mixed. A professor at one of the Australian universities receutly Informed his class that "the darkest hour In the day Is In the middle of tbe night at S o'clock In tbe morning." On another occasion the same professor made his apology for the Intricacies of a statement by add ing, "I cau't give you an easier expla nation without making it more diffi cult." To Make It Tender.
