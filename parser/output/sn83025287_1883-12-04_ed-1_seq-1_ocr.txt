VOL. VI. TRADE TOPICS. The neat Market at Chicago a Little Stupid. PRICES MODERATELY « STEADY. A Stronger Aspect to the Corn and Provision Dealings. STOCKS NUT VERY ACTIVE. The Big Capitalists Eviil-atly Prepar ing for ,Vctiou. CHIC \ GO. [Special Telegram to the Globe. 1 Chicago, Dei*. 3.- On'change to-day the markets •*> re active, an irregular, opening weak and .•'Tor, selling down during the early part vr *he session mid improving towards thu .. ose, si as to finish very near Saturday's la.-., quotations, except in the pits for corn and oats, where an advance was noted despits th persistent ■ hammer ing of tho bear-?. Wheat was fairly active and rather heavy, changing only about %o during the driy, hot at the close December was about }.[x lower fh-ta at 1 o'clock Sat urday, January %o lower and May about 14.3 lower. The market opened weak and gradually fell off some, then fluctuated frequently within a narrow range, but fin^tiy oocatne firm and sold up about %o from the lowest point, changed some and fell ,?s'J and closed tolerably ■steady. Foreign advices continued un favorable. The receipts to-day were a quarter million larger than the shipments, and the stock to-night is about ten million bushel?, mostly No. 2 spring. Yet in spite of persistent efforts by the bears to get wheat down to 90c and in spite of a steidy continuation of most depressing iuflnaucas such as con tinued large receipts— 352 oar lota to-day —and reports i*- a abroad of a. heavy market, wheat neyortlvsla^, —all things to tho contrary notwithstanding- -still keeps its head above water, aad will not be downed. This is certainly to be taken as reasonable argument on the side of what certain old operators declare namely: Tn.at wheat is worth the money, corns what may, it i-< cheap at le3s than a doilar, and is bound to bring a profit to anybody who has the collaterals to bay it and hold it. On call the demand was qnite active and offerings moderately large. Prices ruled }i<®Ha higher. Trading was principally in January. The corn pit was active and a strong feeling was developed. Clear, cold weather and the Oiirlv weakness in wheat and provision*, together wiih anticipated large receipts of corn, brought out free offerings early in the day, UDder which prices declined ■';><', below the closing figure of S-tlurday. The receipts, however, did not prove to be as large a* operators . had anticipated, and with an active specula tive demand prices were advanced I}4@ V'sc, and finally closed %n higher for December, %c higher for January and %o higher for May than the closing figures Saturday. The improvement in corn was due to two causes chiefly. One was that tho people who sold out last week and took in their profit jumped in this morning too quickly to take back the stuff at or under figure, in the hope of reaping results from another rise. Tha other reason was that there were orders already on the floor from outsiders with whom corn bas stood steadily in favor nil along. The bears made a very determined effort to down the whole list, bat it acted very stubborn and got the turn on them quicker than they thought. There was an opposite opinion, however, namely that corn was bid up by th« !ov:;.;s to scare in the shorts. Schwa 1 Dunce, Ljoa and Hobbs are the heaviest buyers. An attempt is being made to earner tha ve^r an I J.itiuary aaliverie3. On call tho market was in good request and oileriflLjs tuir, prices firmer and }£@ ?ac higher. Tradiiig was principally in May. In oats the speculative market followed a goo.; deal after the course of the corn market. At the opening prices wera%@ %c lower, but subsequently advanced, «nd later in tha session ruled quiet and closed firm and %c better than Saturday. No. 2 white in store would bring no premium. The sample trade was only about moder ate and tha feeling was rather easy. On call the demand was light and prices steadier. Sales were confined to May. > Rye was lower and dull, and cash and all futures sold at a decline, with a fair call for the cash, bat speculation was nearly lifeless and few trades making. No. 2 was only in moderate demand for fre.«h lot?, while lower grades all went to the sample' market. On call it was quiet and steady. Trading was confined to the May delivery. In barley thti trade continues quiet, and while No. 2 held up to Saturday's prices, still for the lower grades and all samples a par ticularly doll trade was noticeable and it was difficult to do Bay thing with any fair ness. Samples were in supply in excess of the wauts of the trade, and a very slow trade was the result, with the best and brightest cars doing but fairly, but the dark grain w;is not wanted. Brewers and maltsters bought very little aud but few shippers were on the market. In flour there was a continued dull trade and very few buying orders for any gradt or quality with home dealers taking onlj enough for immediate wants and ship pers and exporters were slow to bid anj kind of a price for tae lots plac3d on sale. Rye flour dull. Buckwheat flour is ii quite light request. Bran and all mil stuffs were in li^ht supply and bringing previous prices ruled with considerable ir regularity. The receipts of hogs were liberal am prices ruled lower, which encouraged ope rators to enlarge their ofierings Bomewha during the early part of the day. Thi stock reported was not quite so largi as generally anticipated which tended to 1 stronger feeling later in the diy. Foreigi advices show no particular change. East Daily £§ GHntie* em markets were inolined to quietness, 1 with prica3 favoring buyers. The ship- 1 ping demand was moderate, and fair rates 1 were reported. The receipts of product < were large, and the shipments quite lib- I eral. ] - Considerable activity' was noticeable in < the market for mess pork, with trading i chiefly on speculative account, and mainly 1 in the more deferred deliveries.- Prices ruled irregular and transactions showed a i reduotion of 300 early in the day. I Later they were steady and prices rallied < 25@30c and ruled comparatively steady to i the close. The shipping demand was mod- i crate. . Old Hutch seemed to be letting go I his holdings, at one time selling 20,000 1 barrels in a lot to Singer. Receipts of live 1 hogs to-day were 50,000, with 20,000 left i over from Saturday. On call there was a ' moderate demand and prices a shade l higher. Trading was principally in the c February option. ■ < The inquiry for lard was fairly act- 1 ive, extending through three months, ] and the offerings were moderately large, i Early in the day prices ruled 10@15c t lower per 100 pounds, but rallied again < 12^@150 and closed comparatively ( steady.

New Yobk, Dec. 3.The market opened strong and excited under liberal purchases by the room trader?, who could scarcely conceal their anxiety, however, to their sorrow, as a short reaction downward then set in, leaving the newly purchased prop erties on the hands of these gentlemen who could not conceive the reason for their being ho badly left with their very uncomfortable load, and were loath to believe that there ■ could be any plausible excuse therefor having received no intimation of the latest development in the lowa pool, namely that the Union Pacific hnd made an iron clad twenty-five year contract with the St. Paul, and Rock Island companies to give them all of its east bound traffic, leaving the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy and Northwestern out in the cold, which'is a position these powerful and wealthy com panies will not accept without a stubborn battle, thus putting to an end any hopes of a settlement of the ' lowa pool difficulties. After this St. Paul RoU down from OUjfa'to 98 with a run. The rest of the market of necessity feverish, but it was noticeable that a3 soon as the news was fully circa lated there was but little stock pressing, la fact that Northwestern preferred was made to look very active and strong and given the appearance of immense invest ment . buying. Northwestern common and Chicago, Burlington & Quincy were steadily fed out during the middle hours, and later they were both quite weak Com mock . was a.. free seller of St. Paul. Euos &Co., were buy ers. Oregon was heavy and the entire list sympathized with the weakness -in the grangers. O=born was a free seller of Chicago, Burlington & Q.iinoy. There is a disposition to await th» expression of Arthur* opinion oa the general situation I and see i' they agree with Mr. Carlisle's. The VVillard socks were wank oa fears iof what mi^ht bo done in congress. It is ; said tkat Keene changed from the bull to ! bear side last week and expeots a general I decline in prices. The- selling of Oregon j Transcontinental, is c.-t;dit«cl to the Ex ! change place party. Insiders sa.y the divi . dend matter would not be decided fora I week or ton days, but a dividend, would probably be paid.. Chase & Hi^'ginson I caused the advance in Chicago," Burling ton & Qnincy. They bought considerable for Boston. The large crops in Kansas nnd Nebraska indicate unusually heavy earnings for the Chioago, Burlington & Quiucy this winter. It was reported that earnings in .Lake Shore for the quarter would would be con siderable over 20 per oe&t. President Ca ble, of the Rock Isb;nj,: and ex-president Riddle, of the Chicago, Rock Island & ■ Pacific, and Porter, of the; Chichago, St. Panl, Minneapolis & Omaha, arrived here last evening. The Twenty-third street party are giving points to buy Central Pacific for a good rise.. New York, Lake Erie & Western preferred is also said to be ' an excellent purchase. Treasurer Tows of the Chicago, Rock Islatid & Pacific company, cays he lias no information in rrgßrd to the Cfjinbk>atio2 of northwestern - roads against the Chi cago, Burlington & Quincy and Chicago & Northwestern. The directors hold an in- i formal meeting to-day and may consider the situation in the northwest. The nsual quarterly divident of 1% per cent will be declared payable February Ist. It. is rumored that Keen*- has sold 50,000 shares of stock on Carlisle's nomination. Yon Emburg is reported a very heavy sel ler through other bankers. Commocfc, Waershoffer and Smith made the most of the Carlisle nomination yesterday, and were more bearish than ever and the general impression was that there would be some reaction in the market in conse quence. Gould was * somewhat surprised over this nomination but he thought Carlisle was not I.early so great on ex tremist of free trade as had been reported and it was doubtful if any great- change would be made in the tariff < during this session. Gould continued to talk bullish and said never in his experience had he known bo few ' stocks in the market for sale. He spoke also quite bullish -on Wa baeh, and referred to the large amount of stock held abroad. Vice President Hunt ing ton, of the Central Pacific thought ■ ST. 

PAUL, MINN., TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 18^3. that j the nomination of. Carlisle was a bad thing for the country. The Vander bilt brokers and following continue bullish on Like Shore, but not on New York Cen tral, and it is reported that the latter com pany proposes to issue $20,000,000 of sec ond mortgage for the purpose of a tew railroad supposed to be a connection with the Pennsylvania coal fields. Rutter's friends deny this, and say that no bonds will be issued at present, al though there may be an issue . made later on for about $100,000, as the company requires funds ■to purchase :.-■' a road. The trunk line people are gratified because of the large increase in east bound tonnage, which last increased ■ 15,400 tens- Vanderbilt "■ : tells his , friends that, these roads have a large winter traffic assured,and "stooks will go kiting after the Ist of Jan uary." The pool in Erie talk 36@37 for the common in ten days, and president Fish, of the Marine bank, who is a director of the company, has been buying considera ble stock. The short inter, in it is estimated as high as $160,000 shares. Jewett says the company will earn 4 per cent, en the common this fisoal year. One Wall street house alone has been lend ing 10,000 shares of Erie • since iast May. The brokers generally attribute the ad vance in prices on Saturday to the opera tions of Keene & Hutchicson and to or ders from Connor's office, but they.thought Gould sold some Missouri Pacific. Con servatives are generally disinclined to buy stocks, and some of think the recent rise is ■ not consistent ' in view of the opening of congress nevertheless i they would not ad vise selling short and don't believe there is any more money of consequence in the market on the bear side. There wes another meeting of the new directors of the elevated road 3on Satur day, but Kneeland sajs nothing new was done and the commissioners adjourned again till to-day. It i 3 said Gould contin ues ' his ■ offer to the Met ropolitan stockholders ■ for the ex changing of second preferred culminative stock for their old Metropolitan shares and all the back interest, but he expects no settlement will be made outside of the courts. The Pennsylvania Coal company has issued a circular reducing prices fifteen cents per ton from Dec. 1. The strongest evidence of the insincerity of the present bull movement is that no body wishes or dares to come openly forward aa-a leader. All the , big men of the stock exchange remain under shel ter. Formerly when a genuine bull market was settled everybody who was anybody came to the front and carried with him whatever following he had. To day you don't : find any prominent man willing to take a stand. Everybody asks: Who is doing this?" and nobody seems to be able to answer the question. Some say it is J. K. Keene; others name somebody else. The only evident and sure thing is that whoever the man or men are they pre fer to hide themselves, and this is in Wall street always an infallable ' proof that they have not come to stay and want to "skip" as soon as an opportunity presents itself. A sincere and solid bull wants all the following he can get. He takes all his friends into the movement. He is to be seen everywhere as active as a recruiting sergeant, while the present manipulators produce rather the impres sion of trappers. The session is propi tious to them. Money is dirt cheap, and there is a big additional lot of it coming with the beginning of the new year. The pot hunters are already trying to take advantage of all this and are working stocks up in the hope of putting them some 10 or 12 points higher by the time the reinvostment seeking funds come out- But the birds have been there before and are getting shy. It 13 6tated that last summer Henry N. Poor, compiler of "railway manual," be came satisfied that tho Northern Pacific 11-.ilroad company was canceling a large floating indebtedness and . that stock must suffer a heavy decline He lormed a .syndicate and sold stock short to the amount, it is said, of near 48, --000 shares. Trie stock was about eighty, aud when below forty the profits wera in the neighborhood of $2,000,000. When the facts came out Poor's estimate of iu uebteuness was 'found to have been almost absolutely correct. When the stock began to go down it seemed to receive mysteri ous assistance in its dowwanrd tendency. This is now believed to have been the re sult of large sales by President Villard, wha is reported to have profited to the ex tent of millions by panning the policy of Jay Gould in dealing /with his own stocks. 

ENGLISH GRAIN MARKETS.:>:V London, Dec. —The Hark Lane Ex press in its weekly review of the British grain trade say?: The land is very wet, but wheat is healthy.

WASHINGTON. The Senate and House of Representa tives Organize Yesterday. CARLISLE ELECTED SPEAKER. A Unique FUral Offering Presented by Tito Kentucky Ladies. THE SENATE DO VERT LITTLE. The President's Message to be Delivered To-day, and tke House to Adjourn for Two or Three Days, 1 Special Telegram to the Globe. | Washington, Dec. 3. —The confidential instructions which were sent last week to the commander of American men-of-war cruising in Chinese waters were only such as are usually communicated to officers for their guidance in relation to the action of our squadron in case of actual hos tilities occurring between the French and Chinese governments. The rights of \'\ American merchants doing business in Chinese cities, whioh might be taken or attacked by the French forces were fully explained and our naval officers were directed to see these rights respected and maintained by the French and Chi nese commodores. A strict neutrality is to bo observed in all cases, no matter in what direction the sympathies of officers maybe. The quarrel is between China and France and is none of our affair. Washington, Dec. 3. —Col. Blis?, special assistant attorney of the star route cases, says the government made every effort to secure the attendance of Ex-Senator Spen cer. He believes Spencer could have giv en valuable testimony for the government, and says there 13 no doubt he made to to Postmßster General James, his secretary. Vanwormer, and to Garfield's friend, Gen. Boynton, the statements em bodied in Bliss' affidavit of July 2G, to the effect that Spencer was present when Dor e?y left money for Brady, and that Dorsey accused Brady of dishonesty. Aleo that T)orsey told Spencer that Reerdell had gone back on him, but subsequently said the matter had been fixed, and Reerdell persuaded to make an affidavit denying hi 9 original statement. On the 4th of November John A. Walsh mailed a letter to President Arthur, and as he says, received no answer, and now sub mits its contents to his fellow citizens which in substance is as follows: In obe dience to a subpoena ha appeared before the grand jury of the district, in the matter of the United States, vs. ex-Senator Wm. Pitt Kellogg, and the jury found an indictment against Kellogg for bribery. He learns the case was fixed for the 10th of Decem ber, and Kellogg will probably plead the privilege of a member of congress to avoid trial. Gentlemen connected with the star route cases are now anxious to seoure his testimony, but he declined to see them, for the reason that when he was a witness be fore he was slandered aud criminally li belled, without the government taking any legal steps for his protection. Walsh con cludes his letter to the president as fol lows: If my presence asja witness on be half of the United States in the cases against Thomas S. Brady and William Pitt, Kelloffg is deemed of sufficient importance by yon to give yonr assent to the follow ing request: I will hold such conferences with the prosecution as is proper and ap pear as a witness in response to the sub poena. First. Merriok or Ker to appear before the present grand jury of the dis trict with a view to the prosecuting of indictments against Wm. Diokson, for slander, and against Geo. Gorham of the National Republican and A. C. Bueil, et«l, of the Critic, for criminally libelling me in the matter of the Benner claim. Second, thst you request Attorney General Brewster to answer my letter of inquiry, addressed to him, touching the letter writ ten by him to the secretary of the navy, W. E. Chandler, concerning me. Third. Your assurance that the government will protect mo as a witness. By protection, I do not mean physicrlly, as I can dp that mystlf. I mean that protection from slander and libel, wh'ch the law en titles me to as witness. Fourth, the assurance that George Bliss will not represent the government ia it 3 action against Thomas J. Brady and Wm. Kellogg. Believe me ilr. Presi dent, if I thus address yon it i«becau3e ex perience ha 3 taught me that no proper remedy can be accorded me elsewhere. Wben yon reflect, sir, that the accused •Kellogg, proclaims his intention of plac ing on the witness stand a member of jour cabinet to discredit tho prosecution, your own witness by having nim recite, language used concerning said witness by another member of your, cabinet, to-wif, the attorney general of the United States, is it not time I should know def initely whether or not lam to have the legal snpport of the government. Ona special counsel for the government in the star route cases, said subpoenas have been isssued for witnesses against Kellogg and the government is expected to proceed promptly. The supervising inspector of steam vessels, Buffalo, reported: The explosion of the boilers of the steamer Colorado in September last, While leaving Buffalo for s trip on the npper lakes, was caused by the misconduct of Thomas Lovett, ohief en gineer, of the Colorado, in weighing down the safety valve and because of negligence and inattention to dnty in other matters. The inspector suspended Lovette's license for an indefinite period, and forwarded the evidence in the Cisc to the district at torney of the northern district of New York, for suoh aotion as he may deem proper.

The comptroller has authorized the Ex chaDge National bank, Hastings, Ne braska, to b^gin business with a capital of $100,000. The supreme court decision of George A. Cunningham, appellant, vs. the Maeon & Bruns*ick Railroad company, et al., an appeal from the circuit court of the Unit ed States southern district of Georgia. This was a suit upon a series of bonds of the Macon <fc Brunswick Railroad oom paoy amounting in the aggregate t > $600, --000, which had been endorsed by the gov ernor of Georgia under authority of the stste legislature. In 1873 the railroad company failed, and the governor in order to secure the interest to the state created by its endorsement of these and other sim lsr bonds, seized the road. In 1875, the state by act of its legislate re repudiated its endorsement on the $600,000 of bonds, herein the controversy. But the state con firmed by purchase its right to road, and m&de provision for the payment of another earlier series of bonds, which also bore its indorsement. Tbe present suit was brought by one of the holders of the $600,000 series of bonds against governor and treasurer of the state and others, to test the question of the states' liability and obtain (relief. The bill was dismissed in the court below on the ground that it was virtually a suit against the itate, and the state was not and could not be made a party to it. This coincides with that view of the case. Harlan and Field dissent. A largely attended caucus of the Demo cratic representatives to-night in the hall of the house for the pnrpose of consider ing the question raised to-day in connec tion with the Chalmers--Manning contest. After a discussion lasting the whole even ing it was decided to refer the oase to the committee on elections with instructions to report in the prima facia right only. This is substantially an agreement to vote for the resolution offered by Calkins to day. The rules of the forty-seventh con gress were adopted, to continue in effect for two weeks after the appointment of the committee on rules. The election cau cus of officers was postponed until the next caucus. Democratic members think that having come to an agreement on the con tested election case they will ba able to or ganize the house to-morrow and receive the president's messa^'i before 5 o'clock. They express the opinmu that after the ro ception of the message an adjournment for two or three days will be taken. Senator Warner will soon introduce a bill in the house for the retirement of tbe trade dollar. The adjutant general of the army has received information of the surrender at- C&mp Poplar river, of five lodges <jf Sit ting Bull's forces from the British prov inces. 

CONGRESSIONAL. The Senate. Washington, Dec. 3.—The senate was called to Older by President pro tern. Ed wards, afier which prayer was offered. The president laid before the senate the credentials of the re-election of Beck to succeed himself, Palmer to succeed Ferry, and Pikes to succeed Rollins. The oath was administered to Bee!*, Bo^en, Culiom, Dolph and Ferry, whose credentials were submitted at the last session. Th 9 custo mary resolutions notifying the house and the president that the senate was ready for business, it was agreed to take recess for one hour, and on reassembly the recess was extended to 3 p. m. At 3 o'clock the senate was again called to order, but there being no prospects of a speedy completion of the organization of the house, they adjourned. In admin istering the oath to tbe senators, the iron clad oath was taken oy Beck, Bowen, Cal lan, Dolphe, Frye, Hoar, McPhersou, Maa derson. Palmer, Pike, Plumb, Sabio, Sauls bury and Wilson and the remainder had takfen the modified oath.

At 12 o'clock, Clerk McPhereon rapped the house to order, and proceeded r .to call the roll. When the representative of the state of Mississippi had been reached, the clerk said he wished to make a statement as to his failure to put upon the roll the name of any representative elect in the Second district, for the reason there was no paper which could be considered a cer tificate of election in the sense of lav had been (presented him. Chalmers had filed four exhibits in support of this claim, but neither individ ually nor collectively did the exhibit afford the clerk sufficient authority for the en rollment of Chalmers. If the governor of Mississippi has issued a certificate of elec tion to any one, it has not been presented to the clerk, la regard to the First district of North Carolina the clerk had not re cecived a certificate for the successor to Poole, deceased. The roll call disclosed 31G members. The nomination for speak or being in order, Geddes said '"I nominate as speaker of this house, for the Forty eighth congress, Carlisle of Kentucky a man acknowledged preeminently qualified for the place " Cannon wresanted the name of Keifer,(Ohio,) and Lyman the name of Robinson, (Mass.). Harrison,- Tucker, Reed and Calkins were appointed ' tellers. The clerk proceeded to call the roll, when the result was as follow?: Carlisle, 191; Ksifer, 112; Robinson, 2; J. S. Wise, (Va.,) 1; Wadsworth, (N. V.,) 1; Lacy, (Mich.,) 1. The clerk declared Carlisle elected, and Randall and Keifer escorted that gentle man to the chair, His entrance into th« chamber was the signal for load applause. Upon taking the chair, Carlisle said: Gentlemen of the hoa39 of representatives I thank you sincerely for the honor con ferred on me by the vote just taken; to be chosen from the membership of ' a body like this to preside over its deliberations is a' distinction Hpon which any citizen may properly congratulate himself, and I assure yon your kindness is -. fully " appre ciated; at the same time I realize the fact that the position which ■ you have assigned me is one of very great labor and responsibility, and while profoundly grateful for this manifestation of your confidence, I shall discharge its duties with a serious distrust in my capaoity to inset in an acceptable manner the require ments of the office. I promise, however, to devote to your service all the zeal and ability of which lam possessed. Gentle men,' the maintenance of order on the floor is essential, < absolutely essential to an intelligent and systematic transaction of the public business, and I earnestly invite i your assistance ; in enforcing the roles adopted for governing our proceedings. The Urge f.dditiin to the membership of the r.oase, resulting from the "late apportionment of representatives, makes this duty even more difficult than before, and without cordial co-operation and support I cannot reason ably hope to discharge the ordinary daily duties of this office. That you will cheer fully co-operate with me in every proper effort to preserve order, and facilitate the business /"-■ Yot/fi. legislation - I have no : doubt.. But, gentlemen, I shall ask something more than mere co-operation, assanng you my earnest de sire at all times will be act just' and im partially. Still, I cannot expect to avoid mistakes and shall be 'compelled,' there fore, to frequently, no doubt, rely od the friendly forbearance of gentlemen on both sides of the house.:, I am sure, gentlemen, that all matters of legislation presented to i this congress will receive from you such a 1 careful consideration as the magnitude and character of the interests involved re l quire, and your action upon them will be ■ «-ise, conservative and patriotic. Sadden i and radical changes; in the laws and i regulations affecting the ; commercial and j industrial interests cf the people ought never to ba made, unless they are impera tively demnnded in some public emer gency, and in my opinion under the ex isting circumstances, saoh changes would not be favorably received by any consider able number of those who have givea seri ous attention to theßubject. [Applause.] Many reforms undoubtedly are necessary, and it will be your dnty after care ful examination of the whole subject in all bearings to decide how far they should extend, and when and in what maniier they should be made [applause]. If tberebe any who fear your action ia this or any other subject which will actu ally be injurious to any interest, or even afford reasonable cause of alarm, I am quite sure they will be agreeably disap pointed.' What the country has a right to expect ■'■ is, strict economy in the administration of every department of the government, just and equal taxation for public purposes, a faithful observance of the limitations of tbe constitution, a scrupulaous regard for the rights and interest of the great body of people in order that they may be pro tected; for congress has the power to pro tect them against eocrochments from every direction Whatever can be done under the circumstances surrounding us, it is meet that this expectation ought to be done in more than judgment. But, gentle men, without detaining you further, I am ready to take the oath of office as pre scribed by the constitution and laws and proceed fo the ootnp'eteorganization of the h>ute. [ \ j-plau t ] The iron clad oath was HOiumistered oy Kelly, the oldest member in continuous service and Speaker Carlisle called the houne to order. The states wtre called and the representatives dime forward ttnd qualified. The house then adjotirued. The message was not given to-day. When Kansas was reached, Peters, the represeutative at lJtr ; , c for that state, at the request of Spriuger was asked to step nside. Springer stated that tha governor of Kansas had forwarded to him a petition signed by himself at>d other state officers, and a large number of citizens protesting against the admission of Peters, on the ground that under the constitution and :a vs of Ksinsj?, he is ineligible to hold of tice. He, however, withdrew the objection and Peters took the oath. Mr. Converse, rising to a question of privilege, said the olerk of the hou^e this morning stated thai had the certificate of the governor of Mis sissippi bten p:eaei!ted by any person claiming to be a representative from the Second district of that stute, be would have placed his name on the roll. For reasons satisfactory to Mannmtr. he had chosen not to present that certificate until action red been taken by the house. He (Mr. Converse) had called upon Manning'^ at torney and asked pei mission to present Manning's credentials to the house.
