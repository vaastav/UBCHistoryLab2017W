2*s£iiik,i A. P. MILLER, Publisher. VVORTHINGTON, MINNESOTA. The total fire loss during November reached $16,003,075, an increase o! $6,000,000 over the same month last year. This is the heaviest November on record, except at the time of the Boston fire and If the December loss­ es this year merely equal those of 1886 the total fire waste of 1887 will be $130,156,400, against $116,600, 000 for last year. Under the federal law, goods in bond may be withdrawn in small quantities from time to time on the order ot the imoorter and the payment of duty on such quantities. A Maine man has imported a lot of liquor, put up in small packages, and gives orders to purchasers therefor, who pay the duty. This ingenious device to get around the Maine liquor law has baf­ fled the State authoritier up to date. The late decision peiliaps, will sim­ plify the matter. The great game that is going on up­ on the European chessboard promises results never dreamed of before in the widest period of speculation. Russia has awakened to some sense of men­ ace in the Canadian Pacific railroad to her settlements along the Pacific. Therefore, a road is to be built across Siberia to the sea of Ochotsk. The cost is something unparalleled in the history of road building, but the Gov­ ernment undertakes the work unhesi­ tatingly. Edward Atkinson has been examin­ ing the records in ready-made clothing establishments to discover whether the white man in the United States is deteriorating in size and weight. As the general result it was found that the average height of New Englanders is 5 feet 8 1-2 inches and of southern­ ers 5 feet 10 inches. The average weight of Americans is between 155 and 160 pounds. Mr. Atkinson also discovered that the average weight of men in this country have increased perceptibly since the war. He is con­ vinced that Americans are increasing rather than decreasing in size. If there are any more poor people who think of removing to California they may as well be warned in time that poverty and misery await them in that overrated country. Thou­ sands of mechanics and laborers are to be found in every town and city with­ out employment, without the neces* saries of life and totally without means to return to more favorable localities. People with considerable capital can do well in California as they can anywhere else,- if they have good business sense, but those with­ out capital are better off at home. The climate is almost the sole attrac­ tion, and that is delicious in many localities, and not attractive in oth­ ers. The national pure-food convention, which will meet in Washington in Jan­ uary, will be a much more important assemblage than scores of gatherings, denominated conventions, which challenge public attention somewhere in the country every year. Its princi­ pal object will be to induce congress to take measures to prevent the adul­ teration of foods and medicines. Its mission is, therefore, in every sense worthy and deserving of wide sympa­ thy and abundant success. The evil which it would breast is far more ex* tinsive and detrimental to the Amer­ ican people than type has ever ex­ pressed. The question involved is one that cannot possibly divide men on political lines and so there ought not to be much difficulty in securing effective legislative action on the sub­ ject. The magnitude of the internal com­ merce of the United States is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the trade of the Lake Superior region alone, which passes through the Sault Ste. Marie canal, much exceeds in number of ves­ sels and almost equals in tonnage that which passes through the Suez canal. In value the latter is much greater, since the freights of the steam­ ships using the Suez canal consists largely of goods of high cost compared with their bulk or weight, while the freights from Lake Superior are chiefly raw materials, such as iron ore, cop­ per, grain and lumber. The average number of tons passed through the Sault Ste. Maria canal in a day exceeds that of the Suez canal, though th6 yearly tonnage is a trifle less because the formei is closed by ice for about one hundred and forty days of the year, while the latter of course is con­ stantly open. But if the increase for the present year in the Lake Superior traffic should equal that of the last, the yearly tonnage will surpass that of the eastern ditch. The canal at the falls of Ste. Marie was Opened in 1855. It had then a lock with two chambers, and would pass vessels drawing eleven and a halt feet of water. Its traffic for the first year was 100,000 tons. Ten years later it was 700,000, and in 1875, 1,260, 000. tons. Then anew lock was be­ gun, and was opened for business in 1881. It is the finest work of its kind in the world, Its length is 515 feet, its width 80 feet, and it will pass ves­ sels drawing 16 feet of water. Siijce that time the traffic has increased enormously. Last year it reached the total of 4,527,750 tons, and the estimate for this year, based on the great increase during the early part of the summer, when the latest returns were made, is 5,892,900 tons, or about one hundred thousands tons greater than th%t. of the Suez canal for last year. The estimated capacity of the canal is ninety-six vessels daily. In one day of the past summer 84 vessels passed through it, so that its ultimate capacity is nearly reached. It is proposed to build anew lock of enlarged dimensions in every way, and capable of passing vespejs of 21 draught.

PRESKMTKO BT GBOVKB. The President's Devoted Exclu­ sively to tlie Tariff Question—A Reduction of the Snrplns Urgently Urged. To the Congress of the United States: Ton •re confronted at the threshold of your leg­ islative duties with a condition of the na­ tional finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually exacted, through the operation of present laws, from the in­ dustries and necessities of the people largely exceeds the sum necessary to meet the ex pensesof the government When we con­ sider that the theory of our institutions guarantee to every citizen the full enjoy­ ment of all the fruits of his industry and en­ terprise, with only such deduction as may be his share towards the careful and econom­ ical maintenance of the government which protects him. it iB plain that the exaction of more than this is Indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and Justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil cottBequences. The publio treasury, which should only exist as a conduit con­ veying the people's tribute to its le­ gitimate objects of expenditure, be­ comes a hoarding place for money need­ lessly withdrawn from trade and the peo­ ples' use, thus crippling our nntlnnqi ener­ gies, suspending onr country's develop­ ment, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening financial disturb­ ance and inviting schemes of public plunder. Thie condition of our treasury is not alto­ gether new and it has more than once of late been submitted to the people's repre­ sentatives in the congress* who alone can apply a remedy. And Vet the Bituatfon still continue*, with aggravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial convulsion and widespread disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation because lie dangers are not now palpably imminent and apparent They exist none the less certainly, and await the unforeseen and unexpected occasion. When suddenly they will be precipitated upon u& On June 30,1885, the excess of revenues over publio expenditures after complying with the annual requirement of the sinking fund act, was $17,859,735.84 during the year ended June 30,1886, such excess amounted to $49,405,545.20 and during the year ended June 30, 1887, it reached $55,567,849.50l The annual con­ tributions to THE SZHXraa 

FUND during the three years above specified, amounting in the aggregate to $138. 068,320.94, and deducted from the surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that purpose out­ standing 3 per cent bonds of the govern­ ment During the six months prior to June 30.1887, the snrplns revenue had grbwn so large by repeated aceumttlatiohs, and it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money meeded by the people would so affect the business of the country, that $79,864 100 of such surplus was applied to' the pav ment of the principal and interest of the*3 per cent bonds stiu outstanding, and which were then payable at the option of the gov­ ernment The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still need­ ing relief, immediately after June 30,1887, the remainder of the 3 per cent bonds then outstanding, amounting with principal and interest to $18,877,500, Was balled in and applied to the sinking-fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the treasury department representations of distress in business cir­ cles not only continued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these cir­ cumstances the contribution to the «inkW fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the expenditure of $27,684, 283.55 in the purchase of government bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4^ per cent inter­ est, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent for the former and 8 per cent for the latter. In addition to this the Interest accruing during the current year upon the outstanding bond­ ed indebtedness of the government was to some extent anticipated, and banks selected as depositories of public money were per­ mitted to somewhat increase their deposits. While the expedients thus employed to re­ lease to the people the money lying idle in the treasury served to avert immediate dan­ ger, our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting on Dea 1 to $55,258,701.19, and estimated to reach $113,000,000 on June 30 next, at which date it is expected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the treasury to $140,000,00(1 There seems to be no assur­ ance that, with Mich a withdrawal from use of the people's circulating medium, our business community may not in the near fu­ ture be subjected to the'same distress whloh was quite lately produced Irom the mm* causa And while the functions of our na­ tional treasury should be few and simple and while its best condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnec­ tion with private ousiness interests, yet, when by a perversion of its purposes, it idly holds 

HOHR USELESSLY SUBTRACTED from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the government to restore in an emer­ gency, without waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now ex­ ists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of 8 per cent bonds, which were payable at the option of the government, has afforded a means for the disbursement of the of our revenues but these bonds have all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund which furnishes the occasion for ex­ penditure in the purchase of bonds has already been made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In the present ttofce of legislation the only pre* tense of any existing legislative power to restore, at this time, any part of our surplus revenues to the people bv its expenditure constats in the supposition that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market ana purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be 8greed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago and it is subject to the suspicion Jr®?.. J* ,waa intended as temporary and limited in its application, instead of con­ ferring a continued discretion and author­ ity. No condition onght to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single offldaL upon his judgment of its necessity, to withhold from or release to the business of the people, in an unusual manner, money tojldin the treasury, and thus affect, at his will the financial situation of the country and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the sec­ retary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested and provided as far as possible with such checks and limitation* as will define this official's right and discre­ tion, and at the same time relieve him from nndne responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds aa a mmm restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating in the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as invest­ ments which cannot he purchased at any P«ce, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell, may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the gov­ ernment It has been suggested that TBI nOSIR 

BONDED DEBT might be refunded at a less rate of Interest and the difference between the old and. new security paid in cash, tlius finding use for the surplus in the treasury. The success of ponos ana it is not entirely oertain that the Inducement wfcfeh ipq* be offered them deposit the money held by the government for use by the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable principle, as establishing too close a relationship between the opera­ tions of the government treasury and the business of toe country, and too extensive a commingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural telianoe in private business upon public funda If this Scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a tem­ porary expedient to meet aa urgent neces­ sity. Legisla clve and executive effort should SW'eraUy be in the opposite direction and should have a tendency to divoroe, as much and as fast as can safely be done, the treas­ ury department from private enterprise. Of course it is not expected that nnneoessary and extravagant appropriations will be for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue Such expenditure, beside the demoralisation of all Inst oon oeptions of publio duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of reckless Improvidence not in tho least consistent with the mission of our people or the high and beneficent pur­ poses of onr government I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of sr.rr rpomlMII— of onr financial situation. The failure of con­ gress heretofore to provide against the d»n. gers which it was quite evident the very na­ ture of the difficulty must necessarily pro­ duce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since your lust acijourn ment which taxed to the utmost all the au­ thority and expedients within executive con­ trol and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inac­ tion of congress, the responsibility must rest where it belonga Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should be fully realised, and though it pre­ sents features of wrong to the people as well as PEBIL TO TBI COUNTBT, it is bnt a result growing out of a per­ fectly palpable and apparent cause, con­ stantly reproduoiug the samo alarming cir­ cumstances—a congested national treasury and a depleted monetary condition ill this business of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation de­ mands a remedy, we can only bo saved from alike predicament in the fnture by the re­ moval of its causa Our scheme of taxation, by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the pub­ lic treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquora It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to Internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary. There appears to be no just complaint of this taxatioa by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tariff laws, the Vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended. These laws, as their primary aud plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles imported and sub­ ject to duty, by precisely the sum paid for such dutiea Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase for use these Imported articles. Many of these things however, areraised Or manu­ factured in our country, and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called production to these home manufact­ ures. because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed articles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people, who never use and never saw any of the imported products, purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country and pay therefor nearly or quite the same charged price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the pub­ lic treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who buy domestio articles of the same class pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty to the home manufact­ urer. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruc­ tion, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they 

IMPOSE A BUBDEN upon those who consume domestic products as well as those who consume imported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our "people. It is not proposed to entirely re­ lieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively continued as the source of the government's income and in a readjust­ ment of our tariff the interests of Americau labor, engaged in manufacture should be carefully considered, as well as the preserva­ tion of our manufacturers. It may oe called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of our pres­ ent tariff laws should be devised with espe­ cial precaution against imperiling the exist­ ence of our manufacturing interests^ 'But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard to the publio welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of immense profits Instead of moderately profitable returns. As the vol­ ume and diversity of our national activities increase, new recruits are added to thoBe who desire a continuation of the advantages which they conceive the present system of tariff taxation directly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of the suspicion, enter taiued to a certain extent, that there exists an organized combination all along the line to maintain their advantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations, and wi\Ji becoming pride We rejoice in American skill and ingenuity, in American energy and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural advantages and resources developed by a century's national growth. Yet when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers, quite bevond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it Buits the purposes of advocacy to call our manu­ factures infant industries, still needing the highest and greatest degree of favor and fostering care that can be wrung from federal legislation. It is also said that the increase in the prico of domestic manufact­ ure resulting from the present tariff is nec­ essary in order that higher wages may be •aid to our workingmen employed in maun actories, than are paid for what is called the pauper labor of Europe. All will ac­ knowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensa­ tion of our laboring people. Our labor is honorable in the eyes of every American rftizen. As it lays the foundation of our development and progress, it is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard of our labor­ er's life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored, and they are entitled to their full share of all our advantages. By the last census it is made to appear that of the 17.372.099 of our population engaged in all kinds or industries, 7,670.493 are employed in agricu.ture, 4,074,238 in professional and personal service (2.944,876 of whom are domestic servants and laborers), while 1,810,256 are employed in trade and trans­ portation, and 3,837,112 are classed as em­ ployed in manufacturing and mining. THE 

NUUBEB TOO HIOH. For present purposes, however, the last number given should be considerably re­ duced. Without attempting to snumerate all, it will be conceded that there should be deducted from» these which it includes 375, 143 carpenters and joiners, 285,401 milli­ ners, dressmakers and seamstresses, 172,726 blacksmiths. 133,756 tailors and tailoresses. 102.473 masons, 76,241 butchers. 41.309 bakers, 22,083 plasterers and 4,891 engaged in manufacturing agricultural implements, amounting in the aggregate to 1.214.023, leaving 2,623,089 persons employed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff. To these tho appeal la made to save their employment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no dis­ position to answer such suggestions by the allegation that they are in a minority among those who labor, and therefore should fore­ go an advantage, in the interest of low prices for the majority their compensation, as may be ab'ected by the operation of tariff laws, should at all times be kept scrupul­ ously in view and yet, with slight reflec­ tion they will not overlook the fact that they are consumers with the rest .that they, toe, have their own wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the price of the necessaries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regu­ late the measure of their welfare and com fort But the red notion of taxation de­ manded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of em­ ployment by the workingman nor the lessen­ ing of his wages and the profits still re­ maining to the manufacturer, after a neces­ sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of the interests of his em nloyea, either in their opportunity to work or in the diminution of their compensation. Nor can the worker in manufactures fail to understand that while a high tariff la claimed to be necessary to -allow the payment of remunerative wages, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manufactures, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of him­ self and his family. He receives at the desk of his employer his wages, and perhaps be reach fore he readies his home is obliged, in a purchase for family use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of theinorease in price which the tyiff permits thehard-earned compensation of many days of toll •a Suggested,Supported by Bxhaistto Argnmsat, The farmer or agriculturist who manu­ facture* nothing but who pay* the liwwuH prioe which the tariff Imposes upon every agricultural implement upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, exoept the ineresse of his Hooks and herds and such things aa hla husbandry produces from tbf» soil, is invited io uid in maintaining present situation and he is told that a hiu^. duty on imported wool is neoessary for those who have sheep to shear, in order that the prioe of their wool may by increased. They, of course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchases of olothlng and woolen goods, to ikay a tribute to his fellow farmer es well as to the manufacturer and mer­ chant nor la any mention made of the fact that the sheep owners themselves and their households must wear clothing and use other articles manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus aa consumers must return their shares of this Increased price of the tradesman. I think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farm­ ers throughout the country are found in small flocks numbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield la ten cents each pound if of the value of thirty cents or less, and twelve cents if of the value of more than thirty cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be sixty or seventy-two cents, and this may be taken aa the utmost enhancement ot its prioe to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen dollars would thus represent the increased prioe of the wool from twenty-five sheep and $36 that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at. present values this addition would amount to about one-third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves hla hands charged with precisely that sum. which in all its changes will ad­ here to it until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use, its oost is not only increased to the extent of- the farmer's tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for the profit of the manufacturer under the operatfonpf thero tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it neoessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himself and family for the winter. When he faces the tradesman for that pur­ pose be discovers that he is obliged not only io return, in the way of increased prices, his tariff profit on the wool- he sold', and which then perhaps lies before him in manufact­ ured form, bnt that he must add a consider­ able sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the'manu­ facture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase,as a result of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold hla wool, seemed so profitable, AX 

INCREASE IN FCBITJE more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and soldi When the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all tlie farmers in the country, and the small proportion they bear to our popula­ tion is considered when it is made apparent that, in the case of a large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff on wool is illusory, and, above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a burden upon those with moderate means and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well, and the young and old, and that it con­ stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the removal or reduction of this duty should be included iu a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of the Increased cost to the consumer of our home manufact­ ures, resulting from a duty laid upon im­ ported articles of the same description, the fact ia not overlooked that competition among our domestio producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this com­ petition is too often strangled by combina­ tions quite prevalent at this time, and fre­ quently called trusts, which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can barely hope for any consideration in the operation of these selfish schemes If, however, in the absence of such combinations, a healthy and free competition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home pro­ duction, below the limit which it might oth­ erwise reach under our tariff laws, and if, with such reduced price, its manufacture continue to thrive, it is entirely evident that one thing has been discovered which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation. The necessity of com­ bination to maintain the price of any com­ modity to the tariff point furnishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity, and that Buch prices are remunerative and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus where either of these condi­ tions exist a case would seem to be pre­ sented for an easy reduction of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenue of the government be pre­ vented by the 

BEDUCTION OF OUB CUSTOMS DUTIES, and, ut the same time, to emphasize a sug­ gestion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double duty to our peo­ ple by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it «an be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor can the presentation made of such consider­ ations be, with any degree of fairness, re­ garded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing interests, or of any lack of appreciation of their value and im- ?ng ortance. These interests constitute a lead- and most substantial element of our na­ tional greatness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. But if in the emergency that presses upon us oar manu­ facturers are are asked to surrender some­ thing for the public good and to avert dis­ aster, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of advantages already afforded,' should lead them to willing co-operation. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of the governmental regard: but they cannot fail to be admonished of their duty, as well as their enlightened self interest and safety, when they are reminded of the fact that financial panic and collapse, to which the present condition tends, afford no greater shelter or protection to our manu­ facturers than our other important enter­ prises. Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform is now offered and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reason­ able relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wronga The difficulty attending a wise and fair revision of Our tariff laws is not under estimated. It will re­ quire on the part of the congress great labor and care, and especially abroad and national contemplation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard of such local' and selfish maims as are unreasonable and regardless of the wel­ fare of the entire country. Under our pres­ ent laws more than four thousand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compare with our own manu­ factures, and many are hardly worth atten­ tion as subjects of revenue. A considerable reduction can be made in the aggregate by 

ADDING THEM TO THE FBEE LIST. The taxation of luxuries presents no feat­ ures of hardship but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical reduction of the duties Imposed upon raw material used in manufactures, or its free importation, is, of course, an im­ portant factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries It would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the man­ ufactured product being thus cheapened that part of the tariff now laid upon such product as compensation to our manufacturers for the present 'price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Such reduc­ tion, or free importation, would serve beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how Buch a change have any injurious effect upon our manufacturers, On the contrary it would appear to give them abetter chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen their ware with free material. Thus our people might have the opportunity of extending their sales beyond home con­ sumption. saving them from the depression, interruption in business, and loss caused by glutted domestic market, and affording their employes, more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and contentment The question thus imperatively presented for Boiotion should be anproaehed in a spirit higher than partisanship and consid­ ered in thelight of that regard for patriotio duty which should characterise the action of those intrusted with the weal of a ing people. But the obligation to declared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented in the government have, by repeated and authoritative declarations, oondemned the condition of laws which permit the collection from the people of nn­ neoessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner promised its correction and neither as citizens nor partisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the de­ liberate violation of these pledges.

Bnt am so much Impressed with the paramount im­ portance of the subject to which this com­ munication has thus far been de­ nted, that I shall forego the addition of any other topic, and only urge upon your immediate considera­ tion the "state of the Union," as shown in the present condition of onr treasury nntf our general fiscal condition, upon which every element of onr safety and prosperity depends. The reporta of the heads of depart­ ments, which will be submitted, contain full and explioit Information touching the trans actions of the business intrusted to them, and suoh recommendations relating to legis­ lation in the publio interest as tneydeem advisable. I ask for these reports and rec­ ommendations the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the government There are other subjeots not embraced In the departmental reporta de­ manding legislative consideration and which I should be glad to submit Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented iu irevious messages, and as to them, I beg to reneat prior recommendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the department of state, a brief history of the transactions of that important depart­ ment, together with other matters which it may hereafter be deemed essential to com­ mend to the attention of tbi congress, may furnish tho occasion for a future commuui. cation. 

GBOVCB CLEVELAND. Washington, Dea 6,1887. WHAT IS SAID OF IT. Tho Minnesota Congressman Favorably Im­ pressed With tbe Message, bnt of Coarse It Don't Go with the Protectionists? WASHINGTON, Special Telegram, Dea 0.— The president's message fell a little flat in the house to-day, although making the tariff its main point of discussion and leaviug out all other mattera It furnished no new points and made no suggestions to congress that would be followed. Straddling and vacillating between protection and free trade, it* pleased no one completely. After having a half-dozen experts at work during the past three months collecting figures from the latest sources, he supplies congress with stale extrpats from the census of 1880. Throughout it is a reply to a protection stump speech. It does not in any paragraph rise above party. Members on the Demo ratio side of the house, while openly prais­ ing the message, were inclined to find fault becauso no plan of action was suggested. The Republicans criticised the message freely. Said a Virginia Bepublican: That man has ignored oar interests entirely. With that document in the land in the last cam­ paign, we could have carried the state without trouble. Congressman Orosvenor of Ohio said: I think our wool men will believe me now. I told them a good while ago: "You have been foollnK with this wool tariff business for soma time. You have been trying to control it ia Ohio by electing a Bepublican hero and a Demo­ crat there without result." They got a black eye in this message that I think will teach them to-go to tbe Republican party hereafter for re­ lief. Congressman Nelson said to-day: I rather think the president's messaee was a pretty good document. It seemed to me that his recommendations were fair to us. Of course there are a good many recommendations of his that I do not like, but I think he has treated tbe tariff fairly. Mr. Lind was inclined to agree with Mr. Nelson. Congresman McDonald sayB: I think the recommendations of the president a good argument in favor of the revision of th« tariff. The subject was fully covered, clearly analyzed, and tbe duty of congress fully Im­ pressed upon It. I am very well pleased with the terseness and completeness of tbe docu­ ment. Congressman Xelley—To execute the objects indicated by the president without destroying many of the leading industries of the country is an utter impossibility. It is said that Mr. Cleveland publicly admitted that he had not known how large the country was until he took his party trip around tbe circle which had not anything like the diameterof that around which Andy Johnson swung Mr. Seward. The reading of the message will convince tbe men wbosa capital, skill or industry are embarked in oar productive pursuits that he knows less of the natural resources of the country and the capacity of its people tban he did of t&e almost boundless limits of its territory when he started on hla summer jaunt. Mr. Randal)—Well, he forces the issue upon us. Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania—It is the most full and explicit utterance in the direction of free trade during his administration. It goes further than any Democratic utterance in this house in any debates on the tariff question, and it certainly will be of great benefit to tbe Re puclican party to have the issue BO well defined. William Walter Phelps—He comes out squarely against protection to American labor, so that every man can see just wbere he is, and on tbat issue we can carry tbe country. Mr. Reed—It has come like a great blessing to us. Now we see what is in our front Senator Prye—It Is exactly the message we wanted. It sbarply defines the issue, and leaves the Republicans nothing to be desired. Senator Teller—It is a rehash of the ordinary free trade stump sneech, not very well selected at that. He lavs down cxactly the plan upon which the Republicans will be glad to stand. J, Randolph Tucker—It is evident that out people will not relish the suggestions about tobacco. 

ONLY COMMON SENSE. Detroit Free Press: Hho fourteenth as. sistant agriculturist of the agricultural de. partment forwarded a communication is which he inquired what particular laws o| "hyjean" the Lime Kiln club followed to pre. serve its general health.

"De seckretary will answer dat we ar' sim, ply guided by common sense," replied thi president "We wash our feet.occashunally. We take a dip in de rain bar'l when it ar' noj too cold weather.

Good Results In Cancer Study. London Special: The fate of the unhappy crown prince of Germany, sad as it is, has done good in its way. The deepest interest has been aroused in the disease which has condemned him to death, and if careful study of the greatest, and, in fact, ot all medi­ cal minds in Europe can do anything, results may be hoped for that will in time save thousands of lives. Thou­ sands of letters have been sent sug­ gesting remedies, each of which, no matter how absurd, has been sub­ mitted to the judgment of competent men. Statistics nave been compiled of every possible sort bearing upon the history of the disease, and already, as a result of the great impetus given to scientific investigation, the dis­ covery of the cancer baccilius in an­ nounced. The existence ot the bac­ cilius had long been maintained as a theory, but it had never been proven until lately by Dr. Scheurlen of the Chanly hospital in Berlin. The result next in importance to the discovery of the baccilius has been the demon­ stration of the fact that persons living in low and marshy districts are most subject to cancer, while those are com­ paratively free from it who live in higher wi dryer latitudes.

The president recognized him ut once, and advancing toward him said with consider^ able earnestness and fervor tbat he was very glad to see him, whereupon the dele­ gates broke out into laughter. Washington Special. Mr. Cullom, who was chairman of the committee on ex* Git nditures of public money in the Congress, has been made chair­ man of the committee on interstate commerce. The advance ot public opinion can be noted in connection with this com­ mittee, for from a temporary committee, appointed during the recess, it has been made a standing committee with Mr. Cul­ lom as permanent chairman, and is destined .to become one ot the most important com­ mittees in the senate. The action of the senate in making this a permanent com­ mittee is a sufficient answer to any base­ less stories that the interstate commerce law will be repealed. However much eome portions of the law may be disliked there is probably not a member of either house who will care to so defy public opinion as to move to repeal it and no changes in the law are to be anticipated except as are designed to make it more equitable or to enlarge its scope by giving to the commission definite powers which are now matters of construction, doubt, or inference. The interstate commerce law like the civil service law has come to stay. Personal News Notes. C. B. Wright, of the Northern Pacific di­ rectory, is worth $6,000,000.
