BROADSIDE. What heading Republicans Think or the HI line Interview. j Copyright, 18S7, by Vie California Associated Press. ] Nkw York, December Mb.— The inter view with Blame published this morning created more of a sensation that the Presi dent a message. The general Republican comment is that it was the trumpet-sound of Republican victory in 1888. The com ment is that the interview, besides dealing abiilliant and effective blow at the free trade doctrine, might properly be regarded as an intimation that Blame was willing to run again in a campaign that will turn on the actual question of party principle. "The interview with Blame." said Chaun cey M. Depew, "furnishes the best answer to the President's message I have yet read, and I think it may be accepted all'over the country as the best statement of Republi can doctrines, in view of the impending conflict over the larill." 

NOAH DAVIS* OLD FRIEN[>. This is what ex-Judge Xoah Davis said about the President's message and Blame's response: "I was delighted to see the President's message, as I always am to meet an old acquaintance. If it were not indecorous to accuse tbe President of plaigtmsm, I should say he borrowed the mtssage from the "stump speech which the late Chief Justice Church, while leader of the Democracy in Western New York, was accustomed to make dur ing the contest between Clay and Polk. With the exception of internal revenue taxation, which he also opposed, there is not much difference of idea, and very little of language, between the message and that stump speech." 

COKKI'PTING AGENCIES. The Light Thrown Upon Defects in Our Social -> it, in. Washington, December Xth. — Justice Harlan, of the Supreme Court, presided at this morning's meeting of the Evaucelical Alliance. Rev. S. W. Dike, of Massachusetts, read a paper on "Perils of the Family." The American family is not strong enough for the strain upon it, from our social condi tion. As a social production, our failures with the family are dangerously numerous. No Christian country takes greater risks, from luose marriage and divorce laws than ours. Colonel Green, of Connecticut, read a pa- i per on " The Social Vice." The speaker named — among the more dangerous and more unnoticed agencies for the promotion of social vice— the public school, with its inevitable mingling of thepureand impure, where evil inliuences are rife, impure novels, and the sensational, scandal-mon gering press, which is the close ally of im pure fiction. The eyes of journalism are turned into every corner. Alas, that its wonderful acumen is so largely employed to discover that which is poisonous. The arts of printing, sculpture and music often disseminate impure suggestions in the most dangerous way of all. The saloon is an other exceedingly fruitful seed-bed for the germs of impurity.

HOME AFFAIRS, CHICAGO GETS THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION. Virginia Speaks Out— Anarchist Most Goes to the Bastile— Naval Affairs— Etc. |BrECIAL DISPATCHES TO THE RECORD-UNION.] PREPARING FOR P.ATTLE. The Next Republican National Convention to he Held at Chicago OB June 19th. Washington, December Sth.— The Re publican National Committee was called to order at the Arlington Hotel at 11 o'clock by Chairman Jones, who briefly stated that the purpose of the meeting was to select a time and place for holding the next Na tional Convention of the party. He said: ' Kecent utterances indicate a determina tion to end this prosperity by adverse legis- I lation, forced upon the country by an Ad- i ministration hostile to American Industry I and mlso indicates the necessity of the re- I turn to power of the Republican party in the National Government, so that Ameii cau industry, wool-growing and sugar raising, equally with iron-making and textile production, may have continued prosperity, and the employes in these in dustries constant employment and con tinued good wages, such as American work men should receive. " The roll was then called, and every State and Territory, with one or two exceptions was represented by a delegate or proxy. An informal discussion ensued as to the time which ,-hoiild be allowed, and it was finally decided that fifteen minutes should be accorded to each delegation. Speaking on behalf of Minneapolis, Windom con cluded as follows: "An issue has been made by the Presi dent in his message, and the Republican party must act upon it. The issue is that of protection or free trade. He (Windom) was glad that the issue had been made. The Democrats knew there was an element in the Republican party of the Northwest that was not as sound on the question of protection as it ought to be. Was it not to the interest of the committee to take the Convention to the Northwest, where it would do the most good?" (ieneral Henderson, of Missouri, acted as spokesman for a lart-e delegation who presented the advantages of St. Louis as a Convention city. After a recess the Chicago delegates were admitted, and Mayor Roche, of Chicago, detailed the conveniences which could be accorded the members of the Convention by Chicago in case that city secured the vote of the committee. Senator Manderson spoke for Omaha, and after setting forth the conveniences which could be afforded by that city, de clared that he was not over-estimating them in the slightest degree. THE PLACE AND DATE. Various other gentlemen spoke in behalf of Cincinnati, New York, Richmond, Phil adelphia and other cities, and finally bal loting was commenced. The result was that Chicago was selected as the place for holding the next National Convention, and June 19th was tixed upon as the date. NATIONAL DEFENSE. Suggestions of Secretary Whitney to Im- prove the Navy. jCoj/yripM, ISS7, by U,t California Associated Prtsc. \ Washington, December Nth.— Secretary Whitney's report will be sent to Congress on Friday. He says with the excep tion of two cases the .Department lias prac tically abandoned the idea of unprotected torpedo-boats, but lie recommends the con tinuation of experiments in submarine boats, and that attention be given to the subject of pneumatic guns and pneumatic gun-carriages. On the subject of naval reserves the De ptrUucut is prepared to formulate a gen- I erm'j^Um for organization similar to foreign bodies. To meet the requirements and condition* of our own institutions it should resemble in organization that of the militia and National Guard, and rest upon founda tions of local interest. He contemplates the employment and rapid mobilization of steamers enrolled on the auxiliary navy list, and calculated to produce the best results upon comparative ly small national expenditure. The Secre tary recommends the construction of live new ships as follows: Two armor-clad ves sels, to cost, exclusive of armament, not more than £'',"00,000, one to be built by contract and one in the navy-yards; and three more fast cruisers of the highest type. ISKI.FSS MONITORS. Washington, December Bth. — In his re port Secretary Whitney says, among other things : "An examination of the character istics of single-turretted monitors show that outsije of the ships in ourownnavy.no antagonist could be found against which they could stand for a moment They were good vessels for their time, but are en tirely obsolete. A lir^t-class modern iron clad could safely anchor, surrounded by a fleet of these monitors without any danger of injury to herself, and any one of her guns could tend a projectile clean through a monitor from stem to stern. It would be little less than murder to send men in these at the present time to encounter any re cently-built iron-clad." CALIFORNtA-MADK 

BTKKL. Under the head of ship-building, the re port says : "It is believed that our private ship-yards can produce war ships equal, and perhaps superior, to those produced elsewhere. It is notably in this connection that the efforts of the Department to raise the standard of material for ships have re sulted in a class of material believed to be superior to that ever produced for any sim ilar purpose. Especially has the steel made upon the Pacilic coast 'been notable for its quality, and the construction of cruisers there may mark an important event in its industrial histury."

The President Afl'ects Satisfaction at the Reception of His Policy. [CopyrijlU, VSSI, lj tlit California Auocialcd rrcss.} ■Washington, December Sth.— President Cleveland expresses himself as greatly pleased at the way in which his message has been received. He thinks that in mak ing the tariff the issue in the campaign he insures New York to the Democratic party in the next election, with a pood prospect of carrying Minnesota and Michigan. The complete laying aside of the much-talked of repeal of the tobacco tai startled and frightened sonic of the Democrats from the tobacco-srowing States, but they are com ing to see that this does not imply party opposition to the repeal of that tax. Last summer, at the Oakview conference, the President took a position in opposition to the repeal of the tobacco tax, but thought that the tariff reformers could consent to it to secure a tariff reduction. That was de cided upon as the thing to be done. In sending his recommendations to f'.in gress the President dealt with what he thoughtjought to be done— not what he was I ■willing should be done. With the knowledge that Carlisle was " the man with whom the President con- suited while preparing his message, the message is read in connection with Car lisle's speech in taking the chair, and the tobacco men are contented. They remem ber that the most they ever expected from the President was tha' he would say noth ms on the subject of tobacco : and" as the matter stands, the message will not drive away any of the Virginia or North Caio hna members. The understanding is that the tariflbill to be brought forth as a party measure will include the repeal of the tobacco tax and this is satisfactory to many of Mr. Randall's followers. 

CALIFORNIA INTERESTS. Representative McKenna Offer Sugges tions to Speaker Carlisle. [Copyright, ISS7, by Uie California Associated Press. I Washington. December Bth — Repre sentative McKenna had an interview with Speaker Carlisle this morning in reference to the assignment of the California mem bers upon .committees of the House. Mr Mckenna desires to go either upon the Ways and Means and Appropriations, or I oreign Affairs. He wishes to be relieved from the Committee on Claims, where he served in the last Congress. The Speaker urgently requested Mc- Kenna to put in writing his personal de sire, also the claim of < alifornia to be re cognized upon higher committees. In re sponse to this request McKenna left the Speaker a letter to-day in which, among other things, be said : " 1 urge the claims of the Pacific Coast to a representation on the Committee on Ways and Means. In one sense the Pacific Coast is a distinct section, isolated by a wide distance even from the Western States, so-called, and has interests which it thinks will be better suoserved by its own Representatives. "The Committee of Ways and Means em braces in its jurisdiction subjects of the highest national importance, more import ant now than ever before, and distinctive now : and. if you pardon my suggestions the committee should be more representa tive now of all parts of the Union than ever before."
