The sneaker Saturday aonointed Senator Harris a member of the committee on the "Fractional Gal lon," bill. The great senator is an adept in disposing of fractional gal lons, from two to six fingers. The chaplain in the opening prayer in the house Monday is rep- resented as uavmg -leeimgiy reier red to the deaths of Representatives "Rofifh and Arnot." We have no doubt the Lord had already heard of it. Mrs. E. W. Cole gave a Nash ville church $25 and they published a card of thanks in the American. We knew a comparatively poor young man ia Nashville who gave $800 to a church and not a darned card did he get. Mrs. Grover Cleveland will take pleasure in sending her photograph to all new babies named after her dear hubby. Parties with babies to name will do weil to consider this before piling further disgrace on the name of G. Washington and A. Jackson. The defeated candidate always finds a bug in the meal. Allen Thorndike Rice was defeated for congress, and now he is filling the North American Review with de scriptions of the horrible monsters he encountered in his perilous voy age through the deadly ballot box Five policemen surrounded a ne pro gambling den in Birmingham Tuesday night and the negroes blew out the light and begun firing. The officers returned the lire and forced their way in, when they cap tured five live ncircs and two dead onus. Our Mr. Pinkerton was in the meelee. In animadverting upon colonels and counterfeit colonels last week we did Col. Duncan B. Cooper of ihe American a grave injustice in classing him with with the bogus kind. Col. Cooper was a real colo nel ;of cavalry in the confederate army and served with distinction. He is yet a brave, generous man. The republicans indued the ne groes to deposit their varnings with them lor sale keeping and then they gutted the bunk. Now a dem ocratic president recommends con gress to pay back to Freedmen's Bank depositors the money rcpub cans stole. And still the negroes persist in voting with republican thieves. Adam Badeau's letters about himself aro interesting.

Look out for his Sunday-school Review Saturday. Our supreme court is rushing business in a whoop. Ni t a single written opinion had been delivered up to Saturday. The old court used to deliver a voluminous written opinion in every case. The new court rattles otl by the dozens old mustyjcasis that havihcrn hanging there for years It is said by lw yers that Judge Caldwell, whom Trm Citizen claims, is the fiiicst "facts" judge who ever sat on the sombre old pulpit whence justice ia dispensed, and that Judge S nod crass shoots questions at lawyers like a Japaneso juggler whizz-ng keen butcher knives into a b ard It will soon be so that TenucfS. ans cannot bequeath their lawsuits to their great-grand children. 

LAI'S. D. JicCORD. Prophecy Fulfilled. A friend at Lynnville sends us the following editorial clipped from The Citizen of Oct. 23, 1S84. He says: "In looking over the files of Ihe Citizen I find an editorial on the political situation that looks like prophecy. It would to use again sorter Hold you so,' you know:" GOOD BYE, MR. HURD. "The idiotic course of Morrison, Carlisle & Co. at Washington laet' winter and the senseless twaddle of Watterson 6ince constitutes the on ly drawback upon democratic suc cess. The effect was plainly mark ed by the defeat of Mr. Hurd in a democratic district. It will not stretch it much to say that Ohio would have been ours but for this Hurd. Democracy would have swept the whole country if thepe men had not crammed the party with this free trade craze. Hurd is one of the ablest of them and his own people sat down oq him. We want to say it now so we may be first (for all of us will say it after the election) that this unwarranted imputation of free trade proclivities to the party will be the cause if we are defeated. Democracy always has been for incidental protection and when we allow a few grannies to crowd ua off into free trade we are simply murdering ourselves. Hurd ought to go and eo ought Car lisle andjMorriaon. Democracy)ha3 no use for men who bring her nothing but defeat." The date that marked the down fall ot the idea represented by these men marked also the beginning cor ner of southern prosperity and th perpetuation of democratic ascen danuy. The Avalanche has suddenly found that a caucus is desirable It has discovered, it tbiuks, that Gov. Bale can be elected this way more easily than otherwise. It is safe to sav it would oppose a caucus if it thought Gov. Bate's chances bet ter outsme. lue Avalanche thus exemplifies machine politics. Th caucus is a machine and it is in tended to grind grist only for its proprietors. Patriots bellow and scream about "pure democracy' and such other lervent expression as would lead a green outsider to think they would die for the party when it is all simulated and" all their loyally to party is a pretens that is intended to operate in th interest of a particular man. W are not to be understood as oppos ing Gov. Bate nor rellecling upon the Avalanche. It is the way they all do. The caucus is intended as ii choking, gagging arrangement in the interest of oue man and against all others. Democrats never fail to elect '.a senator in Tennessee and they have never yet resorted to this republican method. Why not give everv man an even chance? The people do not want any dark lan tern methods foisted upon democ racv. Let's have the clean truck in open daylight. The American i3 actually talking about the "New South," the "New Era," the "new order of things at the south," and other like expres sions that tell of southern progress and development. It will open its eves soon also to the fact that southern democracy keeps pace with southern industrial development and it will yet come to speak of "progressive democracy" and glory in its advanced ideas and its ever expanding adaptability to progres sive surroundings and new condi tions. It took a month for Stewart coun ty to scud in the election returns and the whole of mankind breath less to know the heighth and depth of the boomness of Bob's boom. A sheriff who delays thus ought to be anathema (whatever that is;. In next canvass the state committee must publish in advance that the sheriff who comes in behind with his returns shall be murdered and otherwise maltreated. At Ringgold, Ga., the farmers be came infuriated on account of re peated robberies and incendiarism and Saturday they caught two ne rro thieves and hung them. Mob law is getting to be necessary in the south. Rascality and ruffian? ism run riot once until the people had to organize a Kuklux Klan to stoo it. The newspapers will be orintinir news of a lynching in Giles before very long. Horace Greeley invented the le. gend: "Go West, young man." His monument had a hand carved upon it pointing west. Recently it was discovered that in some unac countable way the monument had been wrenched around so that the hand pointed south. We have mado arrangements to fur nish this lie to southern syndicates in any desired quantities. Stocks declined in a big rush last Friday and are still away off. The little fellows with small capital are the sufferers. Holders of spot stocks are not disturbed and confi dence ia not shaken. Jt was unfor tunate lor the lambs. Men with stmall means and large families had better steer around the bucket shops. When Queen Victoria read Sam Small s diatribe on tne jNasnvnie newspapers she at once ordered that no papers that print indecent or scurrilous matter be admitted to Windsor" Castle. That shuts out all the Nashville papers except Col. Littleton's Sunday-School Review. If Col. Jno. II. Savage will insti tute the organic reforms he threat ens, we'li not only call it even with the old man, but we will use our in lhiMuc to have the sanitary com mittee decorate him with the odor of the Bath. The Union savs "Colonel" J. If. Bible of Cleveland will move to Colorado. If you knew Jim, sweet leader, you would appreciate the monstrosity of that title the Union gives hi in. Mr. Morrison has given notice that he"will talk about the tariff Saturday. Mr. Randall's followers have held a n eeting and determined to oppose, the consideration of his bill as before. And now,having run the chestnut husines into the ground, it would bo in order for some maniac to tell a gasping world where the tuyfel the thing came from and what it m?ncs. Gov. Seay of Alabama in bold tnd manly phrase urges Alabamians to accept national aid to education Seay 6i;ibd3 in the front rank of young progressive democrats at the south. I The Colonels Take a Say. The Banner. Lap3. McCord has determined to put a stop to the boom in military titles. He insists that there are too many colonels in the country who did not win their titles amidst the booming of cannon and rattle of musketry, and he calls loudly for a suppression of the manufac ture of military honors for peace ful civilians. Col. McCord we use the title cautiously, but advis edly will no longer recognize a colonel who can't produce his mili tary commission. If he should en ter heaven an altogether conjec tural contingency he would de cline an introduction to a colonel who is not provided with his, war credentials. But even the incono clastic McCord can appreciate true military glory, bays he: iiowneic, mere De ttiose that are colonels, and it is like being asked in to refreshments to come across a real, all wool, lyard-wide military bero who won his spurs in powder smoke like Gen. L pshaw. The Avalanche. x he ruLASKi citizen oojecis, in a fecetious half column, to the rap id increase in the south of the army of colonels. The Citizen is reminded that it is part and parcel of the southern boom. The till harmonizes wifi 'million' an "biilion" and "wonderful develop tnent. lue special correspon dents, whose quivering pens dea cant upon the glories of Alabama. would be at a decided disadvantage unless they were permitted to dig nify the dispatches with which tney uoou tne eastern presa, as they are now in the habit of doing. Ihe cold and clammy announce ment that "Bgb Green had opened blacksmith shop" would not have half the weight of the splendi statement that "a syndicate of east ern capitalists, headed by Col. Rob ert Greene, have decided to estab Iish a mammoth rolling-mill at this point with a capital of $500, 000." No reasonable man can ob ject for a moment. In the old world, in time of war, title is be stowed for distinguished services i the field; when the country is a peace, it may be purchased from the sovereign as a new garment would be bought from the haber dasher. In this country the sword nas oeen oeaten into tne plowsuare. and there are no titles for sale or for hire. And yet there should b a ,way to win distinction. Th press oi tue soutn, instead ot in sisting upon plain Mr., should agree that whenever one of its citi zens becomes famous for his zeal in the 'development of the resource which everywhere abound, to be stow upon him a title according to the degree of his fame. "Captain' prefixed to a man's name, would mean the pioneer in a manufactur ing enterprise; "major," the more of a big land concern, and "co!o nel" the discoverer and developer ot a big mine or railroad. The Union. we give space to tne foregoing that we may emphasize it. The long 6tring of colonels, so called every man of them would willingly surrender hi3 title to Laps. McCord who seems to be mad because he is put plain Laps, without any sort o title. Indeed, some of us would pay Laps, something if he would rob us of something we have and didn't earn,! don't want and can' get clear of, and regard as the prop erty of dead men. If Laps. McCord don t stop making fun of us colo nels we will give him a title that will stick to him. Nobody but a very wicked cuss would make fun of people who are in the hx of all oflus colonels, just loaded down with titles we don t own, didn t want, and would sell, give away or swap off for anything to eat, drink or wear. We want to say now that we are mad; Dune. Cooper is mad; Cole is mad; Doak is mad; Stahl- raan is mad; Ensley is mad; Sloss is mad, and Shook has gone out in the woods to "cuss," Laps, had better keep quiet. If he thinks we are going to stand on ranK m question of making fun of us he i3 mistaken. But reallj', what is the matter with Laps, is that he wants to be a colonel anel can't. We here by suggest a mode of testing him Let Col. Solon E. Rose call Laps, Colonel the first time he meets him. and see if he don't laugh. The Golden Argosy published by Frank A. Munsey, at 81 Warren street, New York, has just been en- arged to a sixteen page journal. It claims, and we think justly, to be the most fully and most beautiful ly illustrated paper of its class in the world. Eight pages are largely devoted to illustrations, and these pictures a variety and range of sub jects that appeal to all tastes. The Argosy is finely printed on a nand some cream-tinted paper, and its contributors include the best known names "of literature for boys and girls. The tone ot its contents is healthy and pure, and it aims to set a high ideal before the youth of the country. The Golden Argosy enters its fifth year with a circulation of one hundred thousand copies, weekly, and it therefore takes its place in point of circulation among the half dozen leading publications of this country, while ia the matter of merjt it excels them all. We have seen no other journal that gives so much for the money. Tne Golden Argosy is for sale by all newsdeal ers. Mr. Ben. Hunt of the Hunts ville Mercury is an ideal southern newspaper man anel a tlaring ex ponent of the new south. He is pulling Huntsville out of the mire. Country newspapers generally fall into the hands of some sleepy old timer who clings to okl ideas, wor ships fossi'ism, carries a rock in one endj of the bag, refuses to recognize any new idea or thing, de nounces as heresy all advanced thought and condemns everything that is new and progressive. Mr. Hunt is the exact opposite to this. Tue Citizen in a feeble way has at tempted to pursue the lines Jfol lowed by this "progressive young man and to help build up the south Pulaski and Giles coun ty in particular. Many men have thought we were heretic. They wanted to keep on "doing'as daddy did." The developments of the few latest months in the south and the brilliant prospects right ahead of us vinelicate our policy. We are glad to be caught in the sameboat with Ben. Hunt and others of the new men of the new south with new ideas and new nerve. Mr. Henri! Watterson has repeal ed that part of the president's mes sage relating to civil service and silrei. Hiynu-viilo. R. A. Farmer came in Friday night of last week to visit the fam ily of his father, Esq. J. M. Farmer, till Jan. 1. He is a civil engineer on the Texas Pacific with head quarters at Dallas. Boh has been gone two years and has grown from a slender youth to a dignified man with big side whiskers. We learn he has been successful and stands high witU the- company. Prof. Gilmer has a splendid school at the academy. He will give one week vacation for the Christmas holidays and will then close his fall term the 7th of Janua ry, and open his spring term the 10th of January without any vaca tion. The patrons are delighted with his methods in the manage ment of the school. W. C. Carter shipped a Berk shire pig the past week to T. B. Wood, Columbus, Miss. It was on ly 3 months old and weighed 100 pounds. He was the finest pig I ever saw. Mr. M. C. Fitzpatrick has se cured the serv'ces of an Englishman to take charge of his dairy. He is a brother of Mr. Edge, Mr. W. C Carter's dairyman, who had proven himself to, be thoroughly compe tent and skillful. We are glad to see these skilled dairymen einploj-ed and we hope to see this section grow up into a dairy section equal to Chester county, Pa. Miss Minnie Moffitt of Bunker Hill is visiting Miss Fannie Bugg, her old college mate. Mrs. CaLt. Towner gave her a reception Fri day night that was an enjoj-able allair. Lynnville sent out a select delegation, and they report a most pleasant occasion. None can eater tain in more princely fashion than our big Buggs. Mr. A. T. Jones of Nashville and Mr. Geo. Killebrew of Clarks ville were here last week looking after Farming interests, so to speak, if such tender mission could be called by such a name. Dr. M. T. Clark will move Wednesday into the house occupied by Dr. Campbell. The many friends of the doctor and his estimable la dy are heartily glad to welcome them back to the community. Rev. Jo. Tyler lectured here re cently on the devil's trap for the young. He is preachiDg and lec turing all over the south, and is do ing a great work. He and his wife are here among friend3 for & few weeks. Our folks are proud of him. A. J. Giifiis shipped three double deck cars of hogs to Louis ville Saturday. Mrs. Joseph Brings, who fell last year and crippled herself, had almost recovered, when she fell again last week and is very pain fully hurt. Lynn. The Murfieesboro Democrat calls attention to a defect in our system of government that ought to be remedied. Congressmen go to Washington and engage in legisla ting after they have failed of re election. They are frequently soured with defeat, and if not so, they do not feel their responsi bility to the people as sensi bly and are less particular to do their work well. The evils of this defect are being shown at Washing ton to day. Mr. Morrison, soured in defeat, is in the act of precipita ting the party into the very tlifiicul ties that carried it to the verge of defeat anil which the people so loudly repudiated in defeating him and Hurd. He docs not card lor the damage if he can get a little re venge. Mr. Harold Frederic, whose nov el, "Seth's Brother's wife," is to ap pear as a serial in the eany num bers of Scribner's Magazine, is the London correspondent of the New York Timts. He is the man who, two years ago, imperiled his life by visiting the cholera-smitten dis trict of Southern France, sending from there the I first accurate description of the sufferings of the people.

Indian, Station I)., New Tori ' City, Oct2S-ly Farmers Association. The association met Saturday in the circuit court room with fifteen farmers present. Col. A. II. Aber nathy was ma-'e an honorary mem ber by unanimous vote. The subject for discussion, "How can the farmer most profitably em ploy the winter months" was open ed with an able paper read b Prof. D. A. Mclvnight for which he re ceived a vote of thanks from the as sociation. The paper wa3 ordered published in The Citizen. Dr. Harwell thought much of Hie winter might be employed beaut :V- ing the farm and setting out t' j, both for fruit and timber. He . es pecially recommended the plant -ing of the locust. He cited his own experience where he sst a wornout and gullied held a perfect eyesore in locusts in ISoL This once worthless land is now worth acre for acre any four on the place and is a thing oi beaut'. It will i3 a source of profit and pleasure for all time. Col. A. II. Abcrnatuv cave a vivid description of the snow cover ed shivering milch cow and frozen cnicuen?, and made a powerful ap peal to farmers to make better pro visions to winter stock W. S llhca gave hu method of planting locust. Large furrows six feet and three feet ia the drill, set ting in well' rooted sprouts about 0000 to the acre. II is observation was that an acre would be worth $400 in ten years. He made ac curate Burveys and plots of each field in the winter and mad 3 all calculations as to methods of plant ing and cultivation which he care fully noted to be followed daring the summer work whieh he found e f great benefit S. P. White looked carefully af ter his stock. Took an inventory of all profits anel losses of the year,and laid plans for the years work. Had a work shop in which all gtcs and tools and implements wt-re repaired during the winter months. He found it exceedingly profitable to have all tools in good !ix when the rush of spring woik comes, M. Harwell grafted and pruned fruit trees, looked after the rabbits' depredations on his nursery and re paired all hi3 fences during the rrinter. He knew many farmers that did nothing from November to March and their farms proclaimed to the world their indolence. He hud", made a continuous war fare on tLc locust oj his place since 1SG0 and lie now saw his folly. Had he allowed them to grow he would have boon a much richer man. W. C. Carter housed all stock in coid weather and turned to gras sunny days. Hauled o;t all ma nuics in fiozon weather and put iL on poor spots on Aviieit and grass. Prof. Swan thought all plans should ba matured during the win ter for the coming year, but took time to look after the social pleas ures as well as dollars. T. O. Abernathy said all science, was the combined observation of mankind and he regretted that ag-! riculture had made so little progres as a fixed scioDca but that the tiim? has coino when competition is eo sharp that the farmers cannot tak the riak of a failure when a littl study and the gathered experiene of all other farmers is available He regretted the tendency of farm ers to take aad read eo few farm papers. Thought the. winter could lie well 6pent ia studying the farm problems. He believed it was on ly a question of a few yenrs if on slovenly methods prevail till ou ncu lands will bo terrible the fer tility having found a lodgement in the delta ot the Mississippi. II too was a friend to the locust, Knew acres of locust groves that could not be bought for $200 per acre. W. W. Wilkinson thought no far mer should be without a wooe house a3 it added so much to bis comfort and convenience in the cold winter time. He believed in keeping all stock under shelter in extreme weather. Ihe subject lor next meeting is "How best to recaim and preserve our hill side land," T. O. Aberna thy td open and each member to prepare a paper on the subject. All these papers are to be read at the next meeting, Jan. 8, 18S7. J. H.

" Washington, Due. 14th, 1SSG., Congress, in less than a week Irocu its r -openiiJir, Una settled down to ihe serious consideration of business. The re-aK-mbibig ol' foo:h the sen ile and house was accompanied by scenes cus tomary on such occasions, flieri! were the usual crowd of spectators in the galleries who looked down uuon the same tumultuous disorderly crowd on thi ll-.or of tho house, all talkinz at once and at the oy of their voices, and upon the quu-t, slow moving men on the lloor of tho senate chamber, who began the. n-?w session with as little flurry as on any day of the old one. I here were me usual handshaking and exchange of greetings and flower be-uec!eu ueks, the uemoeratio side being the most favored llorally, which caused some republicans to remark that the change ol flowers showed the change of administration. To the vic tora belong th flowers. liepresentutives S. S. Cox and Abram Hewitt were the lions of opening day. When they entered the hall arm in arm they were greeted by a round oi ap plausa. Mr. Hewitt received congrat ulations upon his election to the may ralfy and expressions of regret upon bis retirement from congress. Those who bad served in loroier congresses with AJr, Cox gathered round lum cor dially and those wlio did not know him songnt introductions, liepresentative t-ayers of fuxas. who occupied last ses sion tne seat so long used by Mr. Cox, gracefully surrendered it to its former occupant and took tne one vacated by Air. i'ulitzer. Mr. Cox has already added to his re cord by introducing a bill to prevent republicans from receiving two sala ries at the same time. lie. thus man! tests his iutention to decline the con' gressional salary which lias accrued since Mr. I'uiitzer's resignation.
