a lawyer of recognized I nized ability after a careful review ofI I the evidence and the testimony declaresi I that the case is so flimsy in its characterthat that a jury trial would almost certainlyresult result in an acquittal of the defendantsIn In ordinary legal procedure I convictionon I on evidence so questionable that such adoubt doubt is raised in the mind of a ableI I lawyer would certainly be followed bynn I nn appeal of the case on the ground thatthe the app was not i accordance withthe I the evidence The fart that these menwero I were soldiers does not deprive tem ofa 1 right which is theirs a citizens Tlieoffences offences charged against them are felonious nious in their nature and the men nreentitled entitled to 1 fair hearing of their case bysome some competent tribunal Senator KORAKKR also raises questionsof of law iw well as questions of fact andat at least an important number of his associates ciates in the Senate are in agreementwith with him It is held that tho men havebeen been deprived of certain specific rightswithout without due process of law that theyhave have been charged with convicted ofand and punished for felonies without propertrial trial before tho proper tribunal and thatsome some i not all of the alleged offendershave have been condemned on a mere assumption ton of their complicity in or their guiltyconcealment concealment of a crimeThe The theory that the dismissal of thesemen men imposes a hardship but does notconstitute constitute a punishment is not likely tofind find universal acceptance It requiresan a imagination beyond that of the average age man to see the matter in such a lightThe The general understanding of the situation tion runs t tho contrary In the mindof of the public soldiers discharged without out honor and for the good of theservice service stand as men punished for anoffence offence commit ted With that public tlieonly only question is whether the punishmentwas was just and lawful or unjust and unlawful lawfulA A doubt will remain unless the case isfairly fairly and thoroughly triedrnflir 1 Vnfnlr of Mr BryanThe The Presidents message is damned byMr Mr
