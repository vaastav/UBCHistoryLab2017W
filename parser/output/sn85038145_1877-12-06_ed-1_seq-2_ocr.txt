FAYETTE GOUNTY HEEALD: THUESDAY, DEC. 6, 1877. THE HEEALD. W. V. ILI.1KA.(, Editors. THURSDAY, DEC. 6, 1877. Congress commenced its regular an nual session "on Monday last.

Ex-Govkknor Allen has written a card to the Cincinnati Enquirer, inform ing his Democratic friends that he is not nor will he be a candidate before the leg islature of this State, for United States Senator. Rest in peace, William. Butler, Democrat, has been admitted to a seat in the U. S. Senate, and Cham berlain, Republican, from South Caroli na, has also been admitted to a seat in the U. S. Senate. It wa3 a pretty tight squeeze for either one of them to get in. The Secretary of the Treasury, John Sherman, recommends the issuing of sil ver dollars, with such legislative provis ions as will maintaint its current value at par witli gold. A law of this charac ter, and liberal issues, would be about the best resumption act Congress could pass. Thk Legislature of this State will com monce its session on the first Monday, 7t.h rlntr nf npTt mnnth. r!nnrl wlntpa fnr U. S. Senator are accumulating. After the organization of the legislature, noth- ing of interest to the people will be trans acted until the Senatorial question is set tled, that will for the time being, absorb everything else. It is not true, as claimed, by the repeal of the date clause of the resumption act, that it3 friends are in favor of greenback inflation, or that the repeal -of the date clause means Inflation or repudiation of specie payments; it simply means no con traction of the circulating medium to a degree that wrll injuriously effect the1 le gitimate business of the country. The , friends of the repeal are in favor of the reruonetization of silver coin, and mak ing a silver dollar worth as much as a gold dollar, thus furnishing the means with which to redeem paper money when the holder desires to make the exchange. Specie Resumption The only difference that we know of between Republicans on the question of resumption of specie payments is, as to the time when to resume. All, we be lieveare in favor of resumption some in 1879, and others at any time when it can be done without contracting the cir culating medium to a degree that will In jure the business interests of the country We know that a portion of the Republi cans claim that the near approach to the game value of the paper currency and gold is owing to the ettects of the specie resumption law of 1875. If that law has resulted in the contraction of the paper currency, it has, to that extent, had its lufluence in bringing the two mediums to their present relative value; but, if it , has not contracted the circulation of the paper currency, we fail to see how that . law has produced the Tesults claimed for it. But, while this may have been the re- suit, to some extent, we are inclined to the opinion that the near approach of the two mediums of currency to the same value has its origin in the fact that, in eluding the nresent year, there has for three years, been a large bal ance of trade, between this and foreign countries in favor of the United States . There has been no demand for large amounts of gold made upon us with which to pay balances of trade against us, and, as long as we can keep a large balance on the credit side of our accounts with our neighbors, and demand from them the ., coin with which to balance the accounts, we will be in a healthy financial condi tion, and the margin between the value of our National paper and gold will be re duced to a trifling figure. .Now, 11 Congress will remonetize sil ver coin and make a silver dollar as good as any other dollar, and be prepared to leave a silver dollar or a gold dollar in the place of every paper dollar that may be retired, won't our doors be onen to redemption ; won't we be in a condition to resume specie payment for all the paper money the holders of that currency may desire to exchange? But, the greatest fear to be apprehended is that we may be come Improvident, and over-reaching in : our anxiety to extend our trade and com merce with our Atlantic cousins, and per mit them, in the settlement of accounts, ' to figure up a balance of trade against us, for which they will make heavy drafts upon us for gold with which to meet these balances. In that case, those who fatten upon gold corners, will be able to prac tice their "tricks in trade" upon us to an extent that will drain from us our precious metals, and demand a high rate of per centage for the coin with which to meet balances on our accounts; but, with the balance of trade on our side, silver re monetized, and its volume judiciously in . creased, and made equal to the payment - of all debts, public and private, where contracts are not differently made, there - will not, in our view, be any difficulty in . resuming specie payment, at no distant day; for, whenever the facilities are at hand with which to resume, the holder of our National bank currency, or the Na tional greenback currency, will not be anxious to exchange his paper currency for coin ; he will not be like we used - to, in the days of local banking institutions, afraid of loseing his money by the failure of the bank, because he knows that ever dollar's worth of property be longing to the people of this Government is pledged for the redemption of this class of paper currency. We used to exchange ' our local bank paper for coin, because we were afraid it would die in our pockets within 24 hours; we used to exchange it lor other currency, or for coin, when we wanted to travel beyond the limits of our owri State It was not current out of ir.a own neighborhood; but the kind of paper " .currency we now have is worth as much in San Francisco as it is in. Boston. Good all over the Union, and nobody fears to hold it, because it is a sound, healthy me dium. .,, 

PRESIBEXT H41F.V nESUGE. The annual message of the President has been received. It makes more than six columns of fine print in the Cincin nati Gazette. We have not time nor room to give it in this week's Herald, but the reader will get a good understanding of it from the following summary, which we take from the Cincinnati Gazette: Several things combine to interest ex pectancy of the first annual message of President Hayes. First, it is the first oc casion he has had to speak to the country on that which is called the Southern pol icy, with regard to which it would be vain to try to conceal that there is widely prevalent among those who have consti tuted the backbone of the Republican party a feeling of discontent, or discour agement, or outspoken condemnation, with but little of the diversity of hearty commendation. This we state as a fact, without affirming its justice. The message affirms with confidence that the policy was best for sectional fraternization, was in harmony with the Constitution, was best under the circumstances, that its be neficent results are apparent, that it is not an experiment, that all danger from remitting the lately revolted States to lo cal self-government is now removed, and that the fruits have already justified this course, as time will vindicate it in the public mind. As to resumption, the message i3decid edly against any wavering of purpose, or any backward step. As to the silver ques tion, the message holds that the bonds are all in good faith payable in gold coin or its equivalent, and also that more can be gained by good faith, by reducing the rate of interest, than by impairing our credit by declaring them payable in sil ver. It is for the monetization of silver to such an extent as can he with an equal ity in the value of gold and silver coins, but regards it impracticable to so adjust their values as that they can be kept equiv alent if silver shall be unlimited in coin age and legal tender. We suppose this is the view of all rational and honest men. But there are some who are captivated by the idea of cheating the public creditor, and in this aim they would cheat our selves. The President declares his intention to adhere to the principles of reform of the civil service, by reforming the manner of appointments and removals, and observ ing the plan of the Constitution, which imposes upon the Executive the sole duty responsibility of selecting officers; also, to make all nominations as nearly as possible impersonal, in the sense of being free from caprice or favor in these directions, and to have such a rule for tenure, of office as shall induce persons of proper qualifications to become pro ficients in their duties. To this end he asks the co-operation of the Senate and House, and he also recommends an appro priation to renew the work of the Civil Service Commission, which, it appears, is still in existence. This makes the four topics concerning which tfiere was most interest. In our foreign relations- there are few subjects of interest. We have withheld recogni tion from thede lacto government of Hex ico, President Diaz, because of depreda tion? on the Rio Grande border, and we have undertaken to discipline the bandits by pursuing them in Mexican territory This makes our relations with that coun try rather precarious. Spain has not yet put down the insurgents in Cuba, and the effort causes much annoyance to our ship ping, but Spain promptly makes repara tion for injuries, when a case is made From foreign relations the President passes to the finances. The revenue has a surplus large enough to make the regu lar addition to the sinking fund that childish contrivance of finance by which a debt is to seem to pay itself. He joins Mr. Sherman in recommending a tax on tea and coffee, by which a multitude of little annoying taxes can be taken off. This is a sensible revenue policy, but the demagogue humhug of a "free breakfast table" catches the ignorant, who know not that everything they eat," drink, wear, or think of, is taxed. Besides, we have hardly got settled from the disturbance of the repeal of these "taxes, and to lay them again will take a very large sura from the people, in the higher price of stocks on hand before the Treasury can get any revenue. All changes in duties are a temporary evil, even if an ultimate good. .V ' He also recommends such a policy as shall make it convenient and attractive to the people to invest their savings in the government bonds. That We have had sixteen years of tremendous finan ciering which has carefully avoided this is one of the disgraces of our finance. The message touches upon the army, na vy, Postoffice, Indian affairs, District of Columbia, foreign commerce,' shipping, and a number of other business affairs. It also recommends the creation of a na tional.university at Washington. The message deals plainly with the questions of administrative conduct that have disturbed the Republican party, and beyond this is a plain business document. As to that which is called the polipy, the cessation of military intervention was a necessity. It was an act, not an experiment nor a policy, and it is fin ished, and the inhabitants are at least no worse off without than they were with it, as it existed when Hayes came in. The principle of civil service reform is sound, and is comjjatible with the rational course of choosing qualified men from the ac tive friends of the administration, and with proper counsel with representatives. The position on the silver issue is the only one that can give us both gold and silver In the circulation, and is not only that of good faith, but that which is most profitable to our country. As to the re sumption act, the President evidently sees that it needs the aid of practical measures, but these can not be expected from this Congress, and he is opposed to any backward steps. So are we, but we want practicable' forward steps." ; A correspondent to the Cincinnati Ga zette, from Hillsboro, of Nov. 29th, says : "The untiring efforts of Mr. Jas. W. Dog gett, our old and efficient Deputy U, S. Marshal, to unravel the Hollowtown sui cide or murder mystery have been, re warded with complete success. . The re maining link required to ; determine whether the man Ramsey came to. his death by his own hand, or was murdered, has been found by the recovery of the val uable mare ridden away from home by Ramsey. She was found in the posses sion of Daniel Fearnow, five miles north east of Greenfield. - Mr. Fearnow states that the animal was abandoned in the road near his house by a person answer ing to the description of Ramsey. nmi who, by his strange actions, was evident ly insane. As it was heard that he -had sold the mare and been murdered for the money, this solves the twolmonths tery." mys- Charles Demmitt, charged with the robbery of the Clermont county Treas ury,- had hia examination before a Jus tice of the Peace, at Batavia, last week, which resulted in his acquittal on Mon- day. : . , .; ;. . .: ; New YorHc llve KtcK MMHel.
