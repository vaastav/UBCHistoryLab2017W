HEW ORLEANS B ULLE TIN NEW ORLEANS, DECEMBEB ». 1874. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A fall synopsis of the President s message, toy telegraph, is published in the morning papers. The most int nesting portion of it to ns is that which refers to Louisiana affairs. As we fully expected President Grant reiter ates his recommendation to Congress to take up the question and says he is extremely anxioas to avoid any pretence of undue in terference in State affairs: and if Congress differed with him as to what ought to be done he requested its immediate decision to that effect. Unless Congress acted he should feel obliged, as far as he could by the exercise of legitimate authority, to put an end to the unhappy controversy which disturbed the peace and prostrated the business of Louisi ana by the recognition ami support of that government which was recognized and upheld by the courts of the State. Such is the position of the President, and will be [seen not to vary in the slightest from the attitude he has assumed, from the first, towards the people of this State. It would seem, however, that he has learned nothing by an experience of two years, and proposes to repeat, as a remedy for our politi cal events, what the whole country knows to have been 'an utter failure, and by the hist election denounced as both contemptible and abortive. The President ought to know, and we be lieve he does, but his stnbborness and willful blindness will not permit him to confess it, that his recognition and support of the Kellogg usurpation and fraud mill nut "put an end to the unhappy controversy whith disturbs the peace and prostrates the business of Louisi ana." This fact has been plainly and practi cally demonstrated. Two years ago the coun tenance of the* Executive and the material «apport of the Federal army, were given to Kellogg's Government, but in spite of this recognition and support, the people of Louisi ana have never abated their opposition: have never yielded allegiance to and have never once admitted the right or legality of the so called ile furtu government imposed upon them by a partisan and hostile President, whose prejudices and hate took the places of justice and right in governing his conduct. So greut, too, was this opposition of the honest, intelligent and real citizens of the State, that it could not be restrained from manifesting itself in an outburst of indigna tion and an open resort to arms, before which the Kellogg usurpation, with all of its "recog nition and support" to back it, dissipated like «now betöre the morning sun. This should have convinced the President that his "recognition and support" will not bring peace and prosperity to our State, and that other means must be adopted to ac complish that very desirable object. Again, we arc at a lossto.see how any further ''recognition and support, ' can bo given the usurpers of our State government than have already been extended to them. The whole power of tue U nited States Army and Navy is at their'eomnmu J. The muskets of the former are bristling in our streets, and its cavalry raiding through th.- parishes, whilst the threatening broadsides of the fleet are directed against our city. Yet in spite of all this display of physical power, this effort at intimidation, our people are as immovable and as miterritied a., the granite hills, in their opposition to and re pudiation of the infamous, outrageous and unparalleled government which was created and sustained by means the most corrupt and for purposes the most disgraceful and daibol icaL President Grant may have resolved to con tinue in his line of policy towards Louisiana ; he may have concluded to keep the army and navy in the State ; he may permit United States Marshal Packard to command Gen. Emory to take possession of the State-House with his soldiers, at 12 o'clock at night, and permit no one to outer, except with a permit from Packard : he may allow Packard again to organize a Legislature, to be composed ex clusively of Republican members, completing the quorum by seating defeated candidates : toe may commit all these outrages and more upon the people of Louisiana, but he cas never compel them to bow their heads iu sub mission to Kellogg or any of his horde of plunderers ; nd outcasts. If the President has learned nothing about Louisiana, we believe that Congress will ex hibit more wisdom and more intelligence in the premises, and knowing, too, that all the prestige of Grant is lost by the result of the last elections, and that his power aud influence for all time to come have been destroyed, tlie ' members will not be so scrupulous iu their l'oar of offending the Executive, whose power they once respected, but whose impotence they now despise. We are indebted to that talented lady, Miss B. Derbes, for a copy of her last composition, entitled "Valse Sentimentale." The piece shows a nice appreciation of music, and i.s easy and graceful in style. The Branch of the State National Bank now fully established at the corner of Conti and Boyal streets, and under the direction of Hon. Alfred Wi! tz, is doing a brisk business iu ex change and deposits. All that other banks do is done here, anil their customers are loud in expressions ot praise for the administration. The Opera.—" La Fille de Madame An got"—the greatest opera bouffe of the day was the attraction last night, and will be to-uight, at the Opera House. The mere announcement of that tact will certainly cre ate a rush lor seats, and we presume that Le cocq's amusing burlesque will prove as popu lar this winter «is it was hist season. We were unable to witness the perform ances of Saturday and Sunday, but we learn on very good authority that " William Tell " and " La Favorite " were remarkably weil sang by Mt ssrs. Chelli, Meric, Gadilhe, i'eit linger aud Mesdames De Joly and Teoni. The artists composing the present opera company are steadily increasing in popularity w ith all ou^aiusical « o.aiiois.s. !!•.<, and from what we alai-dy know of them we feel assured their success will go on crescendo. THE 

REPUBLICAN'S LITTLE MISTAKE. It is one of the weaknesses of human nature to judge of our neighbors' by our own standard ot honesty. In this unfortunately too common failing we are compelled to finel the explana tion of a serious mistake committed by the cynical organ of Louisiana cari»et-baggism. In our issue of Saturday, we commented upon the latest bug-bear invented by the Chi cago Tribun*, Harper's Weekly, and the New York lhpablm, in which the South ern Democracy is falsely aud maliciously accused of preparing to demand from the people of the United States compen sation for all kinds of property (slaves included), lost through the war, as well as the repeal of every legal enactaTent or constitu tional amendment conferring political rights upon the negro. Iu our indignant denial ot this preposterously and obviously mendacious charge we made no reference to the New Or leans Unpuk'irnu, for the simple and sufficient reason that it represents nothing either here or elsewhere, and is only kept alive by the most outrageous system of public plunder ever de vised by corrupt political adventurers to compel the taxpayers of the city aud State to support a journal which they thoroughly repudiate, and whose daily task it is to misrep resent and traduce them in every possible way. Argument would be utterly thrown away on the dearly paid advocate of the Packards, the Lowells, the Kelloggs, the Dexvees, the Nortons, the Leans, the Lou Dudleys and the other chiefs of the Republican party of Louisi ana, as not one man in a hundred looks into the columns of that journalistic blood-sucker, save to find out wUeu and where his property is to he sold by the sheriff to fill the capacious maws of the representatives ol the p irtv of rent moral ideas and of their hirelings oi the forum and the press. We therefore only wish to remind the author of the article published in last .Sun day's and entitled, " Dead and live issues " that, strange and inconceivable as it may appear to him, and to the like of him, the tact that there might be y in the advocacy of certain measures pronounced by us to be dishonest aud thievish would never prevent us from opposing aud denoun cing them to the bitter end, aud that the code of journalistic ethics adopted, acted upon, aud shamelessly avowed by the llepuhlimn. how ever well adapted to the tastes and morals ot its party friends, is one which we deem only worthy ot being preached to a constituency by which Dick Turpin, C ipt. Ilolaudo, aud Jona than Wild the Great, are looked upon as typi cal heroes and ideal models. ( a A MYSTERIOUS DEATH. A child of the age of about three months, belonging to Mrs. McGinn, of comer Bienville and Front streets, died early Sunday morn ing under very suspicious circumstances. Air. McGinn, the father of the» child, and his spouse, Mrs. McGinn, were very much under the influence of strong drink on Saturday night last, and from fin ir own statement had a quarrel, during the* continuance of which the child must have met with severe treatment, resulting in i.s death. Our new Coroner for the Second and Third Districts, Dr. De lllanc, who is a very efficient officer, displayed great zeal in what lie deemed his duty—to inquire as to the cause of the child's death. The Coroner was promptly on hand Sunday morning and patiently waited three hours for the City Physician (Scliumak* er) to make his appearance and make an ex« amination of the body. The City Physician did n ot make his appearance on Sunday, and the autopsy was therefore postponed till this morning at 10 o'clock. This morning at lo o'clock the Coroner was again promptly on hand, but Schumaker, though sent for, did not come. He sent a telegram to the Coroner to the effect that Dr. Schumaker will not be down at the corner of Front and Bienville till 1:1 o'clock. Sunday last onr popular young townsman, Mr. Alcce Gautliraiux, left on a Northern tour connected with the interests of his scale and safe agency. His untiring and important labors iu the late campaign taxed his strength to the utmost, and we cordially hope his trip North will recover his health while it facili tates the business ea which he goes. ffV !•<>("f'/r, friend Alcee. It i.s sail that Russia has assumed the place left vacant by the failure of England to recog nize and c i try out Baron Reuter's railroad schemes for the benefit of Great Britain. The Muscovite gladly takes up the project and furnishes the capital aud management for the Persian railroads. When they are built Russia will have an easv entrance into the ' Ueiirt of Asia, and will acquire au influence over the country which \. ould otherwise natu rally impede its march to British Iudia. English diplomacy was at fault when it neglected to avail itself of the immense con cessions obtained by the Baron from the Shah. It is becoming quite a common thing, says the Columbus Liynircr, for Federal judges and other officials to resign in order to escape impeachment: and the readiness with which their resignations are accepted when tendered under such circumstances, is a crying evil. Last year a United States District Judge in Arkansas was permitted to resign, with charges pending against him that demanded his im peachment. A month or two ago Judge Bus teed. of Alabama, with articies of impeach ment pending against him, and immediately after conduct that necessitated the preferring of new charges of a serious character, was also permitted to resign. And now we hear tbit Durell, of Louisiana, also under impeachment, has resigned. No doubt his resignation will also be accepted. A Federal judge is encour aged by these examples to outrage law, justice and decency to any extent, knowing that the only penalty required will be his resignation. What a tall from the standard of'judicial purity and integrity that was recently the boast of our country I It is said that the somewhat unreliable ru mor of a difficulty with Spain iu consequence of the Yirgiuius affair was turned to good ac count in the navy department, iu placing a considerable number of our disused war ves sels on a war footing. THE CITY HALL. APPLICANTS FOR PLACE—STILL THEY COME. It has been repeatedly given forth that the new Council would pursue an economical course in every particular, in the administra tion of municipal affairs, and there is no doubt that it will be carried out to the letter, as it is noticeable that retrenchment has been inaugu rated by curtailing the force in the Mayor's office, reducing the expense in that depart ment alone, fully two hundred and fifty dol lars. The committee appointed at the session of the Council, held last Saturday, to report on officers and their salaries, looking to a reduc tion of expenses to the lowest point necessary for the absolute necessity of each depart ment, as expresse.' iu tlie resolution of Administrator Burke, will begin their duty forthwith, aud it is presumed that salaries, for a time at least, will be razeed down considerably; also that the committee will limit the number of employees in the several departments, to what may be termed a skeleton force. Iu the lace of this established policy, the hall is daily besieged by hundreds of appli cants for place, the great majority of whom, sad to relate, it is utterly beyond the power of the city to accommodate. They hang on. however, with a tenacity quite worthy of re ward, end this public avowal of running the machine on a small scale seemingly hath not the effect of crushing out fair hope worth a cent, as was to be observed by the throng that gathered iu the hall-way aud about the front of the building Monday morning. There was apparently new accessions to the crowd, many new aspirants to position who have come hopefully to the /rout, but who, certainly, are doomed to sore disappointment. This daily invasion, and the clamor that at tends it, is getting to be extremely monoto nous: iu fact it i.s fearfully annoying, and if tolerated much lamer will degenerate into an unbearable nuisance. AN lNqUIUT. Mayor Leeds is iu receipt »if a letter from ( . Schoeller A Bro., of MeKeeport, Pennsyl vania, dated November 30, asking information regarding one Abrose Schoeller. who died here suddenly last month. The deceased was a native of Alsace, and they believe him to have been a near relative. ot THE City* attorney ship. Silt. WALSH WANTS THU OFFICE BADLY. The attempt on the part of Mr. H. H. Walsh, who was employed by the previous Council as an assistant attorney to assume the office of city attorney upon the authority of a commission is at once surprising and amusing, inasmuch as it evinces on the part of Mr. Walsh a willingness to make himself a stumbling block in the way of the present City Council, and places him in the somewhat ridiculous attitude of attempting to occupy a posiiion which is manifestly untenable. The affair is simply an attempt on the part of Kellogg to obstruct the Council, but v.e are quite sure it will prove what Kellogg is himself -a miserable failure. If there were any force in Mr. Walsh's claims, that the law gives Kellogg the right to appoint to fill a vacancy in a municipal office, the city char ter gives the Council absolute power to dis charge any municipal officer other than the Mayor and Administrators by a simple ma jority vote, ami the Council will not,, there fore, we take it, hesitate long about notifying Mr. Walsh of tin» tact that there is a vacancy in the City Attorneyshl p. Section 12 of the amended city charter, alter pointing out the course to be pursued in tlie event of the impeachment of the Mayor, or any of the Administrators, says: "All other officers, clerks and deputies shall be remova ble from office at the pleasure of the Council by a majority vote; and no contract shall he made for the services of any officer, clerk or deputy by which he shall claim to serve or draw salary after removal from office, or the abolishment of the office by the Council; nor shall any annual salary be construed to entitle the employee to more than his pay at so muen per annum until discharged.'" The City Attorney is the mere creature of the Council, to be elected by them, removed by them at pleasure, or his office • «'«. listu'l altitgeiher. Therefore wc say the attempt of Mr. Walsh to hold an office from whicli he can be ejected under the law in short «order, or which may be abolished by the Council, is at once surprising and amusing. • We have received the following communica tion: t >ffice City Attorney, « Room Iff, City H ill. Sew Orleans, Dec. 7, 1871, S Hon. Chas. .7. Leeds, Mayor, and the Honorable Board of Administrators *«f ihe City of New Orleans : ireiifkintii — Having been appointed by the Governor ot Louisiana to the office ol Citv Attorney for the city of New Orleans, made I vacant bv the resignation of the Hon. Geo. S. Lacey, and having been duly commissioned and «nullified as such, I bave taken charge ol the City Attorney's office, and all the books, papers and archives belonging and appertain ing thereto. You are doubtless aware that when a vacan cy occurs in any municipal office arising from death, resignation or otherwise, it is made the duty of the Governor to appoint a suitable person to fill the unexpired term. See 21st An. Rep., page 538, State ex rel. Attorney General vs. H. J. Leovy, act No. 27 of the Legislature of 1868; section first, 25th An.

Impor tant interests ot the city require immediate attention iu and out of the courts, and 1 can not be too earnest iu my assurance of a n adi uess to co-operate with the municipal authori ties in the material and other interests ot the municipality. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, H. H. Walsh, City Attorney.

VICKSBURG. Negroes Advanced on the City in Three Columns. Four Negroes Killed and a Number Wounded. Negroes Now Advancing on the City by the Warrenton Road. At last the difficulties between the whites and negroes at Vicksburg, growing out of the attempt on the part of the Governor to foist upon the people a sheriff' who had been de posed by the citizens on account of his in ability to discharge the duties of his office, has culminated in a pitched battle bet ween the opposing factions, and we may expect to hear of much more bloodshed before the trouble is settled, as the negroes have been wrought up to a high pitch ot excitement by inflammatory addresses. The following special has just been received, and we await anxiously further intelligence : VIcksburo, Miss., Dec. 7—Iff : 15 P. M. Editor N. O. Bulletin : < >ur citizens were called under arn s at 3 o'clock this morning. The negroes advanced on the city in three columns, aud commenced an attack on the Cherry street outskirts. They were driven back with a loss of four killed and quite a number of wounded. One citizen was slightly wounded. The ne. groes are now advancing on Warrenti in road, aud another conflict is momentarily expected. Yicksbcegee. f Associated Press Dispatch« ».] \ iuksbit.g, Dee. 7.—The reports iu circula tion last night that large bodies ot armed negroes were on the way to the city to take possession of the court-house, were confirmed this morning. At nine o'clock the alarm bells rung to warn the citizens. Business bouses of all kinds are closed, and the whites are under arms marching out on the various roads to meet tlie enemy. The court-house i.s m possession of the whites, and the negro sheriff is a prisoner, citement prevails. iircut tx- ; to a a a is THE ELECTION IN IBERIA PARISH. To the Editor of the N. O. Bulletin; In canvassing this parish it was found from the statements of Commissioners o* Election, tally sheets, and United States Supervisor reports and compiled statements iu hands of the Conservative Committee, all which cor responded, that Wui. F. Schwing received 110 votes majority for the House ot Repre sentatives over his Radical competitor L. A. Snaer, and corresponding majorities for other Conservative candidates. A protest was filed by Ihe Radicals to the counting of poll 5, in the shape of affidavits by five different parties charging intimidation. One affidavit sets iorth that B. D. Dante rive publicly threatened to discharge a negro if he voted the Conservative ticket, and alleges that this deteried others from voting. Signed by five parties. One other affidavit, by one of the same parties, declares that sixty colored men, voting Conservative ticket-, were intimi dated, and would have voted the Republican ticket. Had all these affidavits been accepted as gospel then- would have been a difference in the result of iffO votes, so that the Conser vative ticket would stiff nave been elected and W. F. Schwing entitle«.: to a seat in the next Legisiat ure. Bat 75 affidavits were filed on the part of the Conservative.-;, showing a fair and "peace able election without intimid-titou. The registration and poll lawks show that 512 persons registered from the third ward, in which poll 5 was placed. That ffff'* voted at poll 5, so at poll ? in the second ward, and 77 at poll 3 in the second ward, making a total of 5( G who voted from that ward. There was a registration of one in every three aud one-half of ihe population ot that ward, and an actual vote of one in lour. This ward contained about 330 whites and near 200 blacks, giving a white majority of 130. Of the 163 who voted at polls 3 and 1 nearly all were black. Only two or three white Radi cals lived in Ward Three, hence, whf n the negroes voting iu polls 3 and 4 are deducted there would remain a natural majority of at least 250 white Conservative voters. But, lurther, there could not have been more than sixty negroes at poll 3 to be intimidated, supposing every colored man tame forward to vote, and hence, every colored man at that pell must have been intimidated aud compelled to reverse his wishes iu order to sus am the Radical affidavits. But thirty-nine vote? were cast tor the Re publican ticket, of which at least thirty were cast by negroes. Hence the absurdity of the charge of intimidation. The fact is, that oue of those affidavits was made by a defeated candidate for constable ; one by a Radical Postmaster, who was inter ested in Darrall's election ; one by .» Radical parish surveyor; one by the manager of th«» Tax Collector's office, now rewarded by the appointment ol Deputy Internal Revenue Col lector, and cousm of the supervisor and de feated candidate for parish judge, the Parish Surveyor being bis nephew, the Public Printer his cousin, and bimsel» Public Ad ministrator.
