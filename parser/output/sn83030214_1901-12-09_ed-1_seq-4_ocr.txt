t CEXTCRT OF VACCINATION. DR. FLOYD SL CRAN*DALL SETS FORTH THE REMARKABLE RESULTS I»K. FLOm M. CRAXDALL SETS FORTH THE REMARKABLE RESULTS ATTAINED. In view of the growing carelessness with regard to vaccination, the recent revival of the Anti- Vaccination Society here. and the somewhat alarm lag Increase this winter In the number of smallpox x-letims In New- York. Boston and other Eastern cities. th« Information contained in Dr. Floyd M. Cr&n<Jall's article, entitled "A Century of Vaccina tion." published in the issue of "American Medi cine" which makes its appearance to-day, is of timely and popular Interest. Dr. Crandall says: People have become apathetic with regard to vaccination, which in many communities Is much 1,.,-- • ;■.; ■.. roughly carried out than it was a hundred rears ago. With a. full knowledge of the serious "nebs ol the disease and with the clear evidence of the marvellous efficacy of vaccination, the operation was then extensively and thoroughly performed and the disease in many localities was completely ex tirpated. In Denmark, for example, the practice was so effectively enforced that in IS2C there had not been a case of smallpox for eleven years. It was then reintroduced by a traveller from Ham burg. In Sweden the mortality dropped from an average of 2,045 deaths a year to 4SO. In Vienna In 1800 the deaths from smallpox for ten years Had averaged 53,", a year. After the enthusiastic intro duction of vaccination in 1801 the deaths fell during the four following years to 164, 61. 27 and -. re spectively. The first vaccination in America was performed in Boston on July s. ISQO. by Dr. Benjamin "Water house, professor of practice of physic at Harvard. He vaccinated seven of his own children, Fix of the vaccinations being successful. Shortly after ward three of the children were sent to the small pox hospital and one was inoculated with small pox. None of the three, it is needless to say, con tracted the disease. The first vaccination in Xew- Yr>rk was performed by Dr. Seaman, In May, 1801. The operation was Introduced into the Southern States through the persona! efforts of Thomas Jef ferson, then President, who fully understood the ravages of the disease among the black population. To comprehend what vaccination has done for the world we must understand what smallpox was when Jentier announced his great discovery. Its extreme contagiousness, its excessive rate of mor tality, its loathsome character and the maiming and disfigurement it left behind combined to make It the most serious scourge from which the race has Buffered. It has been justly described as "the Attlla of diseases, the very scourge of God. over running countries and destroying whole popula tion?."' When Jenner performed his first vaccina tion in ITS*. smallpox was causing one-tenth of all the deaths of the human race. Bernoulli!, the mathematician, estimated that more than 60,000,000 of the inhabitants of Europe died from smallpox during the eighteenth century, being an average of €00,000 a year. Others place the number even higher. Specific proof of its fatality is shown by Cowan's vita! statistics of Glasgow. He states that between 1783 and 1792 36 per cent of all the deaths under ten years were due to smallpox and be tween 179$ and Mfc 32 per cent were due to that cause. These are no uncommon figures, for it was asserted by others that ono-third of all deaths tinder ten years were due to smallpox. It was esti mated by Condamine that this foul disease de stroyed or disfigured the fourth part of mankind. When the smallpox was introduced into Mexico by the Spaniard? in 1520. 3,500.000 died within a few y«*ars. In 1737 70 per cent of the people of Green land died of smallpox. in 1707 in Iceland. 18,000 in m. population of 50.000 died in a single year. It is believed that 6.000.00U North American Indians fell ■victims to its ravages. It has done more to exter minate the aborigines of this continent than any other cause. In 1537 the destruction of life was enormous, whole tribes being exterminated. Among half civilized nations the appearance of smallpox often caused the abandonment of whole ♦owns, the sick being left to their fate. The capi tal of Thibet, fir example, was at one time left without inhabitants for several years after a visita tion of the disease, in the present century Cerea, In Brazil, was visited by «mailpjx. and in a popu lation of 70.090 there were 0.490 victims. Among civilized nations the ravages were almost equally great. It attacked .very class and order from 'he peasant to the king. It wrought who]. -sale havoc among royal families, notably those of Eng land and Austria. When Louis XV of France died VI smallpox the corpse iras deserted by every one except a few priests, who were detailed and en forced to perform the last rites. The disease had a marked influence, not only upon the history of nation?, but in modifying the character and hab it* of life of the people. Or?« hundred years ago smallpox was the most ■widely spread disease which affected the human race. To-day many physicians of large experience have never seen a case. Communities of thousands rtf Inhabitants pass months and even years without its occurrence. No sane person of adult years can read history without believing that some marvel lous power has been at work to produce this change. What else can it have been but vaccination? It will surprise many to know that in former times smallpox was essentially a disease of child hood, over 80 per cent of all cases occurring in children under five years. As vaccination is done chiefly in infancy and childhood, it is a strong proof of its efficacy that the occurrence of the disease has been transferred from childhood to adult life, when immunity has been exhausted. Let us now consider the history of smallpox since fsuuer'g time and compare it with previous condi tions. In England it has been estimated that in 16«» the average annual number of deaths a million from smallpox was 4.170. Dr. Farr estimated the rate a minion at 4.260 for the thirty years from US to 1757. Official registration of the causes of death began in 183 S. From that year to 1854 a penr.l of optional vaccination, the average rate a million was 430. From 1854 to 1894. a period of enjoined vaccination, the rate for the whole period •was 140. From 1872 to 1534 the laws were more rigid •jja . the rate was K. Excluding the epidemic of ,5; ]t Wii! "' but "■■'■ '" tJle fourteen years preceding 1572 the average death rate from smallpox in the British army per 100,400 strength was 11.1: for twen ty-Two years after that date. 3.7. This was ren dered even higher dv the loss in ISB9 of twenty three men in India. In 1895. in a population of over Tour million, there were 55 deaths from smallpox in I^ondon. With less than one-fourth that popu lation Sir .1. Simon states that during the eighteenth century the annual smallpox death rate of London ranged from ?..<**„' lo 5,000. Sweden furnishes some particularly valuable Tacts, for excellent records have been kept since I.*-.. Between 1774 and IBH the average smallpox mortality a million living was 2.04.",. During fifteen years : : V C to ISl6> of optional vaccination the av erage mortality was 4*. and for seventy-seven years of compulsory vaccination it averaged 155. During the ten years from ISM to ISS3 (the latest record I can obtain), under still more rigid laws, ; There -was no year ii. which the rate a million was wove i>: it was in one year as low as 0.2. In the twenty -eight years before 1801 the- rate was over '2.0*1 in eighteen different years, reaching in 1779 the enormous figure of 7.W. Since 

ISOI it has been !! * i " ' 1°" '" forty-six different years and below 10 in fifteen different years. Attempt has been made by anti-vaccinationists to minimize, the valu-j of the*" remarkable figures .By the theory that there was a natural decline in ; smallpox before vaccination had been adopted. The facts are. however, that vaccination was taken -up m Sweden with th* utmost enthusiasm. It is laj«wn that In l»02 eighty physicians had lymph in Their possession. In I*o4 royal orders required vac cination by means of the pastors of churches ■while In the following rear the Royal College alone re ported 25.^«i vaccinations, it certainly requires great credulity to believe that the rapi.i'fall in the .mortality rate from 2.045 to 4>>" was due to a change :ti the character of the disease. . Prussia also affords some most convincing evi •dence of the efficacy of vaccination. The Prussian army was the first place where vaccination was required on a large scale. It was begun in 1834. an during th» next fourteen years there were but sev enty-seven cases of smallpox and varioioii. and not — death. In 1843 an epidemic of smallpox oc curred in Prussia, but in the army there were on .twelve cases. During the Franco-German War the German troops, about one million in number, we ■well vaccinated, and but 453 deaths occurred from smallpox. In the imperfectly vaccinated French army, on the other hand, though smaller in size. there were 23.400 deaths from that disease. It should be understood that the troops from the other States making up the German army of that time were not so thoroughly vaccinated as were those of Prussia, but all were vastly better vaccinated than the French. Since 1874 a much more rigid vaccination law has "been in force in Germany. Vaccination of all in ■fants is made compulsory, with revaccination of all at school a^e. Th mean death rate from small pox per million before this law was 309. Since th law was passed it has been i;.; during the last ten years 7. In the army, in which the vaccination law is most rigid enforced, there has been but one death from smallpox since 1874. The general rate has never raised materially since that yea The case» that have occurred have been largely upon the frontier and among foreigners. These figures from Prussia have given the ant vaccinationists much perturbation of spirit. They liave been able to get around them only by actual ■untruth, in asserting that the law of IS3o was a compulsory vaccination law. That law urgent recommended vaccination, hut did not make it com pulsory. Such a '.aw was passed only in 1574. Th antl-vacclnationlsts have tried to explain the di minished death rale here, as in Sweden, upon th ground of improved sanitation. The argument is absurd. There was no sudden improvement in sani tary conditions in either country, and Prussia and Sweden axe not more sanitary than other countries where there has been no such radical change either In the occurrence or the mortality of smallpox. In Austria vaccination is not compulsory and there we find some striking facts of different char acter. During the years in which the death rate from smallpox in Prussia, was 7. in Austria it was 4EB. In Belgium, another country in which vac cination Is not compulsory, the death rate per million from 18.* to ibM was 441. when Prussia's vas 22. Are we to infer that Prussia is Just twenty tunes mow sanitary than Belgium? In the year Ist* the death rate from smallpox of Switzerland ■was fifty-fourfold that -of Germany:- that of Bel r'um, forty-eightfold: Austria, eighty-onefold, and Hungary, six hundred and sevenfold. In writing: this paper I have had no intention of producing a scare or of adding to the feeling of prehension which seizes a community upon the beginning of an epidemic of smallpox. On the con trary. I have attempted to show that apprehension s»ro "scare" are entirely unnecessary to those who hi* adequately vaccinate By showing the serious ness of smallpox and the efficacy of vaccination I h?ve hop-d to increase in a slight measure its more genera! performance. Under our lorn- of govern ment. It seems almost impossible to hope that com pulsory vaccination will ever be attained. The •dread of abridging the- personal liberty of the few f':rr, leads us into neglecting the rights of the many. It Is only by persistently educating suc ceeding generations that anything like adequate vaccination of the community at large will 1- ac- i complished. It seem* also that the. lesson must j ccctsienalir he enforced by the bitter experience ! Of a more or less fatal epidemic. ! Experience of mere than a ren<n>T has confirmed Stnd strengthened the teachings, of Jenner. except I ttcon th» eingle point of the duration of immunity. 1 Sony; of the Ie» sons taught by this experience may be summarized as follows: Finn— The rln : Wesson cannot be better stated than in the words of the Berlin Board of. Health: "Vaccination in infancy, renewed at the end of childhood, render's an individual practically as safe from death from smallpox as if that disease had been survived in childhood, and almost as safe from attack." Second— The. duration of the immunity • conferred by vaccination is variable. In many individuals vaccination in infancy and revaccination In child hood axe sufficient for life protection. In a limited number immunity is lost in five or six years. It l.« never possible to knw'v with certainty to which class an individual belongs. In the face of an epidemic, therefore, vaccination of all who nave not been vaccinated within five or six years is giving what the lawyers call the benefit of a reason able doubt. Every one who has been vaccinated in infancy aad -childhood should be vaccinated not less than once in adult life. Third— Th«* immunity conferred by vaccination is In direct proportion to the thoroughness with which it is performed, and this is shown with considerable accuracy lo* the character and numier of the re sulting scars. Vaccination in infancy alone is not suffi cient to wholly prevent smallpox among the adult population. { Fifth— Optional vaccination has not proved suffi cient to protect the community from smallpox. Compulsory vaccination is a measure -warranted by more than a century of experience. Sixth— The mild compulsion enforced dn this coun try, by requiring vaccination or evidence of Its recent performance upon admission to the public schools should have the hearty support of parents and physicians alike. ROBBERS AND PLUXDER TAKEN, TWO MEX CAUGHT ON A TRAIN WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THEIR BURGLARIES. The last of a terles of recent burglaries In Xyaok wan committed early yesterday morning, and th~ burglars are now lodged in jail at En glewood. N. J.. having been captured on a train from Xyack, between Engle-wood and Nordhoff, by two policemen. At an early hour yesterday morning- the resi dence of Truman H. Baldwin, in South Nyack. was broken into and a large quantity of silver ware and five overcoats were stolen. Mr. Bald win i? a New-York lawyer. He has one of the finest homes in South Nyack, and it is protected, as he supposed, by eleotrie burglar alarm?. He thinks in this instance the burglars entered the house through a small opening in the rear, where carpenters have been at work, and cut the alarm wires. They went through the first floor, overhauled the silverware, threw out all thr.t was plated and carried off the solid sftver. They then went to the home of Howard Van Buren. president of South Nyack Village, got into the baser, cn t. but took only a few silver spoons. When Mr. Baldwin discovered his loss he tele phened to the Englewood Police Department, and two officers went to the station and waited until the S:.'i9 train from Nyack arrived. In the front seat of the second car they saw two mfen with a large package between them. One of th<= men appeared to have several overcoats on. and the other tried to conceal the package. The officers pulled their revolvers and told the men to open the package. They declined to do that, but one of th? officers tore open the pack age, aiid found t contained a lot of silverware £nc>. an overcoat. The officers took the men off at Kordboff and walked them back to Engle- Kocd, where th".v were locked up. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Baldwin's son. Georpe E. Bald \. In. accompanied by Police Justice McKim and Policeman Shakespeare, went to Engiewood and identified the stolen property. The thieves gay their names as Frank Wy nian and Frank Martin, and said they wer.? from New-York. They were both well dressed, and heavily armod. They declined to make any statement at the hearing in Englewood. 

XEWARFS XEW COURTHOUSE. CASP GILBKRT. TUB ARCHITECT, TO BE ITS DESIGNER. f'ass Gilbert, architect for the r.-w Custom House, was selected on Saturday by the Essex County Courthouse Commission to design the new Court house to be erected in Newarrf. The plans were competitive and the eommfasibn sifted them down to Jive, which were examined by Professor Warren I* Laird, ot the University of Pennsylvania, whose choice settled upon the plans by C.iss Gilbert. It was not known by the commission or the expert that the plans chosen were those of Mr. Gilbert until after the decision was reached and the paper pasted over the signature had been removed. The cost of the building is restricted to JKAOOO. It 13 probable that marble will be used. • HE DIDXT BJUXG BACK THE CHAXGE. Frank Bowdish. forty-eight years old, an employe of the United States Express Company. In Newark, is under arrest on a peculiar charge of petit larceny. Bowdish was on duty in the office Satur day when a man entered with a package for ex pressage. He handed to Bowdish a twenty dollar bill, saying he had no small change. Bowdish said he would have to go out and get the bill changed. He did not return, but walked to the ticket office of the Laekawanna Railroad and bought a ticket for New-York, giving the twenty dollar bill to be changed. Then be bonrded a train.

S— The outlook on the Stock Ex change was somewhat brighter during the last week owing to the Message from President Roosevelt, the speech of the Prince of Wales and the unex pectedly heavy captures in South Africa. These latter olso helped the market for mlnin? ."hares, and Kaffirs rose slishtly on indefinite predictions of the termination of the South African war. The money situation was satisfactory, and there was no prospect of stringency in New-York. Paris and Berlin bill?, while after January 1 the cus tomary cash returns from the monetary centres promise easy money f or several weeks to come. It is thought this promised situation, combined with the present low pri-e of all storks, will stimulate both investment and speculation. Th» volume nf business to date is still limited. American securities were lethargic, in spi'e of th* improvement In Wall Street. Home rails had a brighter outlook on improved traffic reports and the promises of the directors to increase economies as well as the efficiency of the roads during the corning year The silver situation is still critical, although sil ver has recovered slightly from its lowest quota tions. The future of silver is said to depend en tirely upon whether the United States refrains from pressing further .sales.

WEEK IN PETROLEUM. Operations have been resumed more actively dur ing the last wtek in the lower Southwest field be cause of the recent heavy rains, which have given a good supply of wattr. The recent drouth has delayed work for two months in some localities, but the operators took advantage of the good roads to get material into the field. December promises to be one of the busiest of all the twelve months. Such work as has been accomplished, ■while producing nothing in the shape of gushers, has nevertheless brought out some fairly good wells, but has tapped no new pools. It is now proposed to drill some of the old wells consider ably deeper, in the hope of finding oil at lower levels than have yet been leached. Experiments of this nature have been tried in other districts with some degree of success. The Gordon sand territory, in the "Little Germany" district, Mar shall County, has some new wells tending- north east toward the Cameron development. There are not fewer than fifty wells drilling and rigs up In this region, and such as are drilled In the sand' are nearly all "wildcats," and will have an important bearing on the field when completed. Several of them promise well. The South Perm Oil Com pany's well on the Lewis farm is the best producer so far. making ninety barrels a day. Light wells and "dusters" are the general result in the Pink Creek district. Lewis County, as they were in Greene County. North of BeaMs Mills the South Perm Oil Company found a -ijy-barrel producer on the Reynolds farm. Active- work has been going on in tile Salem development In Harrison County W. Va. ■* The Federal Oil Company has drilled a test well on the Conley farm, three- fourths of a mile in advance of developments, and it has a showing of fifty barrels a day in the stray tana. Operators are watching for a further development Other efforts in this* region have been only ordi narily successful. On the Ohio side the Guff.\v & 1 '•.

THE XEGRO PREACHER WHO SATS HE SAVED THE NATION IN THE CIVIL WAR. Freehold. Dec. 5 (Special).— The Rev. John Wash ington Leeklnes, the aged African Methodist Epis copal clergyman of this place, who is preparing a petition to Congress, asking for compensation for losses which he alleges he suffered in consequence of divulging a plot to capture the cities of Wash ington and Baltimore in the Civil War. now says he was induced to take up the work of getting the petition through a dream cr vision. He says that one night his father's spirit appeared to him and told him that he should make his demand? known and obtain just recognition of his^services from the government, for which he had*Uone so much at such a persona! sacrifice.

He has in his possession a deed for land in Maryland, made out in his name, the title to which he says lie lost through being obliged to flee from Baltimore in 1563. Mr. Leckines's claim is that, while a waiter in the Fountain Hotel, in Bal timore, in 1863, he overheard an important con versation between two Confederate spies, in which he learned that General Lee had planned to capture f;<iltimore fi.vt, then Harrisburg, Perm., and so enable the Confederates to take Washing ton, which would thus be cut off from protection. He says be at once revealed his information to Colonel Hoffman, Collector of the Port at Balti more, who caused the arrest of Spates, one of the spies, on whom important papers were found. Mr. Leekines asserts that by this action he really saved the T'nited States. He Is well educated, and has retired from active preaching. PREACHER TO HE A FIRE LADDIE. THE REV. .1. A. FAIRLEY TO JOIN A CHEM ICAL ENGINE COMPANY. Nutley, Dec. The Rev. James A. Fairley. pas tor of St. Paul's Congregational Church, and one of the best known ministers in the county, has sur prised his friends by making an application for membership in the Fire Department of Franklin Township, of which Nutley Is a part. A large number of the firemen who had served for seven teen years recently resigned, and the Hoard of Fire Commissioners has been busy trying to get suit able men to fill their places. The Rev. Mr. Fairley yesterday concluded to put in his application, and it was received by the Fire Commissioners last night. His application will be accepted Wednesday night with several others. Mr. Fairley has asked to be attached to the Ya macaw Chemical Engine Company, which is the Okies! in the township. Mr. Fairley, in explanation of his request to be made a volunteer fireman, said that he "believed it to he the duty of a minister to look after the material as well as the spiritual welfare of the community." Mr. Fail-ley's determination to be come a fireman has caused the fever to break out among members of his church, and It Is said there will be a number of the minister's congregation to follow his example, and the prospects are that the Fire Commissioners will have an easy task to 1111 up the ranks of the different companies. Mr. Fairley is popular with all classes, and many are now waiting for the time to come for the min ister to show his ability as a fireman. FORMER H f 88. \ \'H RE A P PEARS. ABRUPT ENDING OF HONEYMOON THROUGH THE COMING OF A SPOUSE BE LIEVED DEAD. Paterson. Dec. 8 (Special).— were filed in a divorce suit yesterday by Mrs. Dora S. Mounce against her husband. Jesse T. Mounce, who was supposed to be dead, but who appeared about six weeks ago and interrupted his wife, who was start ing- out on her second honeymoon with August L. Reese, to whom she was married under the im pression that Mounce was dead. The Mounces were married in Brooklyn In Au gust, 1892, by the Rev. Mr. Austin, of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Mounce was at that time man ager of an Insurance company, and M!-»s Sloane, his wife, a member of a well known family in Pompion. this county. She had been a trained nurse in Brooklyn. After the marriage Mounce was transferred to Newark and later to Passaic. Miss Christina Slate, seventeen years old and comely, took up her abode in the house as nurse to the child of Mr. and Mrs. Mounce. A few months later Moance and the nurse disappeared, and a note from Mounce told bis wife that he had gone forever. Mrs. Moance took op her old avocation and sup ported herself and her child. Last December she received what seemed to be. incontrovertible proof that her husband had died in a hospital in Cin cinnati from injuries sustained in a trolley collision The letter purported to be signed by John G. Don nelson, a Cincinnati attorney. It recited the cir cumstances of his accident and death and told bow Mounce had asked that word be sent to his wife after his burial. Letters and photographs were also returned. About th" same time Mrs. Moutue was nursing August L. Reese, employed in the customs depart ment in New- York, through a siege of typhoid fever. In his convalescence Reese fell In love with his nurse. About six weeks ago they were married in this city and they started on their honeymoon At the Jersey City station of the Pennsylvania Railroad the newly married pair almost stumbled over Mounce, the first husband, who. watch in hand, was making- for a train. The woman ut tered a cry and fainted. Mounce looked at her and her companion. lie took In the circumstances and fled. When the woman recovered she made an explanation to Reese. The honeymoon was ended Reese and his bride parted, but only to fortify themselves by future action. Further efforts have been made to find Mounce. but so far have failed Joseph A. Bergen, a lawyer, has started divorce proceedings for Mrs. Mounce against her husband on the ground of desertion, and when the decree has been obtained there will be another marriage with Reese. 6 THE DALE TNQUEST. THE DEFENCE DECLARES THAT THE WOMAN WILL NOT BE HELD FOR THE GRAND JURY. The principal witnesses at the Dale inquest in Hoboken to-night will be Dr. William T. Kudlleh. the physician who attended L'meline Dale, and F. S. Billings, of Boston, who occupied the room next t.> Mrs. Dale and who overheard her talking with the child. It was not intended to have Mr. Billing^ tes tify until the trial, if indictment is found, but yes terday it was decided to have him called at the inquest by the defence. Joseph M. Noonan. for the defence, says that Mrs. Dale's request to testify at the inquest will not be granted, nor will Elbert Waller be produced. The subpoena for Waller is in Mr. Noonan's hands but as the witness is now in Philadelphia, he wlti not be asked to romp on. The defence says that the evidence for t.j-night -vill be so strong for Mrs Dale that the Prosecutor will not expect her to be held for the grand jury. The failure of Mr. Dale to come from Chicago is causing much comment. It was on the stories of his brother, Russell Dale, that the arrest was made with the expectation that the father would -ome on immediately to substantiate his brother* charges. The father has failed to give any informa tion whatever. A CHURCH'S CENTENNIAL. Dumont, Dec.

It may be a brother, or sister, or cousin, or aunt — perhaps it's that cthtr person — to whom you would send a particularly fine gift, yet hesitate to afford yourself the luxury, because the lump sum, coming on top ot other demands, is rather more than you ought to afford — just now. Our Library Club is the thing to help you out of that dilemma: For joining the club and paying a single dollar will give you immediate possession of a thirty, fifty, even a ninety dollar present — with the rest to be paid, after the holidays, in little sums from month to month. The books are genuine dc luxe editions of Dickens, Shakespeare, Scott, Macaulay, Balzac, Dumas, fyiskin, Bulwer, Eliot, Reade, in from 10 to 40 volumes — the sort of books that rery wealthy people buy — priced at about half the usual cost. Most of them are limited editions, of which no more than 500 sets ever were or ever will be printed. There's surely nothing "common" about such a gift. And its bound to be treasured for a lifetime. At the Library Counter. Full details and catalogues by mail, if you cannot come to the store tcsee the books.
