Nearly all the places of busi ness were closed and the people sjeiued'to be perfectly willing le give one day to the consid eration of our position before Heaven, and. our obligations ibr the many blessings we. enjoy. Religions services were held in only one church we believe. This is as it should be, at ouch times as these a union of all-cbristians is as emblem of what may be hoped for in the fu ture. A large congregation assembled in the Methodist Episcopal Church and listened to an eloquent sermon by Rev. M. Swick, of .the Lutheran Church. tSTThc 16lh Regiment, until recently in L.amp at tYostcr, has been removed to Camp Dcnnison, where letters for the present will be directed. When they remove, further notice will be given. Capt. Jas. L. Drake Reuturned home a few days since. By a letter received from him we learn that he wants a few recruits for the 23 Regiment. The Capt. does his Regiment no more than justice when he peaks of it as follows: -The Regiment, for which' I.am recruiting is second to none in Western Va. Its record hows that it has marched over five hundred miles in' the gloomist and most inhospitable part of the TJ. 8.

It will also disposo of some Colonels, Majors, etc., whose riddance the country 'will easily survive. tJ3gT. W. Higginson of Worchcster, has ccr tainly invented a new, comparison. He says that it. is as absurd to attempt to carry on the war without striking at slavery as it would Le to storm hell without interfering with, the per sonal comfort of Satan. tjThe c'itixens pf Charleston have unfurled the black flag, to signify that they will give no quarter.

JgjjTSir Thousand dollars have already been contributed in New York for tho relief of the destitute loyalsts of North Carolina on the Hat tenia Banks. ggfThc rebels continue their depredations on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Harper's Ferry. For twenty miles tho' rails have been stolen; as "well as all their machinery' which could be seized. jgjThe War Department has stopped, the raising of any more cavalry. There are now in the field 55 regiiucnl.f, numbering 53,700 men, of which Ohio has six regiments of 1000 men each. . Jeff;, Thompson thus reports the result ofhis engagement nt Frcdcrickstown, Missouri. "The encmv came out two to my one, and whipped me, wher I left." 5The New York McralSi reporter at the bombardment of tho, Beaufort batteries , says: 'I counted no less than forty shells burning at one lime" That fellow must be. a., splendid hand at figures. , trIt is announced that Senator Beigbt of Indiana has left bis State and joined the rebel arniy.Tvhere he is to reccive'a Brigadier-Gen cralship. There is nothing surprising -in this act -of 'treachery. Congressional. Both branches opened on tho 2d with a Quorum present, in the House. Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee, appeared and was sworn in. lie is a Union man, and was elected by a jargo majority in East Tennes see, before the .State had taken steps to cet out of the Union. Tho case of Mr. Foster, of North, Carolina, was referred to tbe committee on .Elections. So was the case, of Mr. Segur, Rspresentntivo from Accomacand Northampton counties, Vn. Mr. Blair, of Western Virtiinia. successor to !Mr.C.arlile,was qualified. The memori al, of Mr.-Beach, of Va,; asking to bq ad mitted to a seat in tho House, was refer red. Jno". W. Ried, Missouri, in the re bel armr. was expelled bv resolution. A jo;nt resolution was adopted in the House 1 ' . 1. at 1 f icuuciiug iuo iuiiuks ot uongress to Uapt. Wilkes for his arrest of-Mnsou and Slidel; and a resolution was adopted requesting the President, to have Mr. .Mason confined and treated in the samo manner Col. Cor coran is 'by tho rebels. .Slidel is also to recievo tho same treatment as Col. Wood. This is doing tho matter up promptly and (well. In the Senate, Mr. Trumbull, of IHi- 1101s, at once gave notice of a bill to confis cate tho property of rebels, and cive free- jdom lo persons in the Slave States; and Mr. Wilkinsor, of Minnesota, of n bill to abolish the distinction between regular and volunteer forces. The movement of Mr. Trumbull is one lof much importance, and will nrobablv lead lo considerable discussion.

CAMP UNION, FAYETTEVILLE, FAYETTE CO. Va. Nov. 19th, 1861. MEi.ClsAOlT,?- The monotony of camp lifavwas broken oa the morning. of the 13th instl aBd wevanin look' up our lino of marcu towara kauiey., iue reoeis naa beenfirieg ttofit traisi from the South west 'side ''of New river, fori about three weeks, Md the object of the moving was to "clean, tnem out." lien. Uenbatn -was then acro3s the river,"and had silonced their guns from firing over the rive; .at our men. Nothing of note transpired that day. We crossed the New river at the junction of itrnnaftlwFGauleti ,a"n'd'were soon on the piko that passes through Fayetteville. TTO VHCalOipCU imt DlgUk IIIUUU tcuu uu tbe"side of'a hill; -alter -marching abdut fourteen miles-, and' it -was not long until those who were not on guard, were sleep ing soundly on! the straw' which was fur Tiishea from1 two of 'thfee' wheat stacks, thai were near bY. About midnight, we were roused and ordered to pack knapsacks. I cot up. but found myself so sore' and stilT,(the effect of the previous day's march ) that I could' go no farther, .nnd, as the knapsacks-were left, I was" detailed as one of the guard over them. With daylight came rain nnd the news that Floyd was again stealing" away-from Gen. Benliam's brigade. 'On the morning of the 16th, teams came to haul the knapsacks to the brigade, (Gen. Schenck's,) and I went on, although about half of the knapsacks be longing to the 23d were left. About 3 P. M. I came up with the brigade at Fny- ntteville, and found that they had follow ed 'the rebels no farther than this place, but Gen. Benbnm had followed them sev eral miles beyond here. Several regiments, of Ohio boys had come across the mountain from the Charles ton pike. Among them were tbe 34th, 37th, and 44th. These were to attack Floyd in the rear, but he was about half an hour too soon in finding out the ar rangement, and "made oft with Himself.' Tho rebels had a good position and were well fortified on the pike between Gnuley and this place, nnd nearly opposite where we were encamped previous lo tho 13lh, and it would have been impossible (if such things be), for our' troops lo have taken it in front, and from this pike which was the only way, but it appears that they like to back out before the way is closed. They destroyed a great many wagons, tents, cooking utensils, fcc, and our' troops cap tured somo stores, among which was a wagon load of ammunition. There wero three of our men killed. I never heard the rebel loss stated. I saw one of their Colonels (Croghan), who was shot by three boys of tho 12ih. Both parties were" under cover watching their chances when Col. Crcghan exposed himself and ordered his men to advance, lion, lien ham shook hands with him before he died, The 3d Brigade, (Gen. Schenck's,) is the only one left on this pike, and tbey are in comfortable quarters in this town. U tho 16tb, 100 men from tbis brigade, tin der Col. Scammon, wen south towards lial eigb. On the morning following, three companies of the 23d and about tbe same number of the 26 th, went-out to the same place under Lieut. Col. Hayes. I under stood that we were' sent there to intercept the retreat of a" body of 300 cavalry;. said to be between here and Charleston; but tbey did not come, and lest night we re turned to!6ur quarters. While there, how ever, some females camo to where I .and three-others were 6n guard ; they were in search of their father wno was taken pris oner. When they came up lo us, one of .t L - , .

I told her wo were federal troops.- She said she had heard very hard stories of us, that we were ragged but all before her disproved' that yarn and that we would' take all their cattle, horses, bos and, in fae.ty everything that we could gel bands on. ' Tsbo' said she hoped we would catch tbe devils nnd especially old J loyu I'Tsssured her 'that was what should-bo done; she hoped it was and that- soon.

Tbe fol.awiwrjs GeneraKPrice's procla- mation issued-at, Neosha, but bearing no date: Fellow Citizens: In the month of June iastXwas called to command a handful of Missouriahs, who nobly gave up home and comfort to exposure in the gloomy jj0nr tbe cause ofypur bleeding country, struggling with lbe most causeless and c'ru cl'despotism known among-civilixed mcn," when peace, and protection could 'no longer be enjoyed but at the. price oi honor and liberty. Your chief magistrate called for fifty thousand, men, to drive the ruthless invaders from, our soil mnde fruitful by your labors and consecrated by your homes to that call. Less than five thousand re sponded. Out of a male population ex ceeding 500,000 men, onein forty only stepped forward to defend, with their per sons and their lives, the cause of constitu tional liberty and human rights. Some allowances are made on the score of lbe want, of 'military organization, a supposed want of arms, the necessary retreat of the army southward, the blockaile of the river, nnd the presence of an armed and organi zed foe. But nearly six months has now elapsed ; your crops have been tilled; your harvests have been reaped; your preparations for the winter hove been made, the army of Missouri organized and equipped, and fought its way lo the river. The foe is still in tbe field, tho country bleeds- and our people groan under the inflictions of a foe marked with all the characteristics of bar barian warfare. Where now' are the 50,000 to avenge our wrongs snd free our county ! If fifty thousand men had flocked lo our standard with shot guns in toeir hands, there would not now be Federal hirelings in the Stato to pollute our soil. Instead of ruined com munities, starving families and desolated districts, wo should have had n people bles sed with protection and with stores to sup ply the wants and, necessities and comforts of" life. Where are those fifty thousand men ! Are Missouriaus no longer true to themselves? Are they a timid, time-serving, craven, race, fit only for subjection lo a despot. Awake, my countrymen, to n senso of what constitutes the dignity and true greatness of a people. A few men have (ought your battles; a few men have dared the dangers of the battle field ; a few havo borne tbe hardships of the camp, the scorching sun of summer and frosts of win ter; the malaria of the swamps, tbe priva tions incident to our circumstances, fatigue nnd hunger nnd thirst ; often without blan kets, without shoes, with insufficient cu-tb ing, with the cold, wet earth for a bed, the sky for a covering, and a stone for a pillow glad only to meet the enemy on tbe held where some paid the noblest devotion known among men on earth to the cause of your country and your rights, with tbei lives. Bui when one has been lost in the field three have been lost by disease, indu ced by privation and toil. During all thes trials wo have murmcred not. We offered all wo had on earth at the altar ofourcom raon country and our own Beloved Missou ri., And we only now ask our fellow citi zens and brethren to come to us and help to wear what we have gained, and. to win our glorious inheritance from the cruel band, of the spoiler and oppressor. Com to. us, brave sons of Missouri ! Rally to our standard !

A special dispatch to Tribune says that a most important order will soon be issued from headquarters, informing the Governors of tho several free States that no more regiments, batteries, or indepen dent companies must bo raised or leceived by them, except upon the requisition of tho War Department. I ho regiments, die, now forming will be completed ; unless it shall be deemed more advantageous to tbe service to assign the men already raised to incomplete' organizations already in the field. General Superintendents of- the Volunteer recruiting service will be appoint ed for all tho states, and recruiting in each will be directed upon the system pursued in the regular arm v. Ihese superintend onls will bo officers of the regular army retired otneers if possible, or officers of ar tillery not serving in tha field. Depots for the collection and instruction of re- recruits under command of the Supcritt tendents, will be established at tbo follow ing places, and such other as shall be con sidered advantageous in each of the States. Those in tho West are: Minnesota, Fort Snelhng; Iowa, Davenport; Wisconsin, Madison; Missouri, Jefferson or Benton Barracks': Michigan, Detroit; Illinois, Springfield; Indiana, Indianapolis; Ohio, Columbus; Kentucky, Louisville. The enlistment papers for volunteers will be the same nsforreguiafs. Clothing will be issued for them nt the btalo Depots. Commanders of regiments in the field wanting troops' will make requisitions di rectly on tbe superintendents tor their re spective states. No more cavalrv will be accepted by the Government, nnd it is tho purpose of the commanding General to muster out of service all cavalry recruits in incomplete regiments, unless they willconsent to come in ns infantry.- Ibe number of cavalry al ready, amounts to between sixty nnd sev enty thousand, much more than lbe Gov ernment cau use. The Herald's dispatch says information has .been received that one clause in the treaty with Mexico provides for a loan of $10,000,000 by our Government, to be paid in five annual sums of $2,000,000 e.icli, in return for tho mercantile' advanta ges nnd transit of United .states troops through Mexican territory. Gen. McClellnn is understood to have nindu lbe most urgent representations to the President in favor of a regular and systematic exchange of prisoners. He will probably succeed in having his views ap proved nnd acted upon. There has been, no' advance of rebel pickets upon Our lines, as has been slated Un the contrary, our pickets have ndvnnc ed into tho enemy s country. McUall is moving toward Leesburg, and Gees. Smith and Porter are extending their lines for ward, while McDowell and Franklin are watching tho enemy's centre, which is growing weaker nnd weaker every dn'r Tho Times dispatch from Washington 2d, says: I am enabled to state, in the most positive manner that tho struggle is over, nnd that the President's conservative policy is 'sustained by' his Cabinet with en tire 'unanimity. No flag bos been flying from tbe rebel batteries on tbo Lower Po tomac for some time until a' few days sinco when the South Carolina flag' was unfurl- e'd nnd it is now displayed all, along their line. The World's dispatch says: Messrs, Cameron and Seward were serenaded last night, but only the latter appeared. He simply cempliraentcd the music, and std ted tbat in ten days tbe country would re- joico nt great news. Judge Douglas's Children. The Cincinnati Enquirer's Washington correspondence has the following under date ot tbe 14th inst: Douglas's .two children by his first wife, nro, still here. They are heirs to" $500,- 000 worth of property m a southern Stale. The Confederates threaten to con fiscate this property as belonging to Union ists. A few days, since a. Southern agent of tho kindred of these children arrived here to take- them to their friends in tbe rebel Slate, that their property might lbu3 bo saved from conbscation. xSut Mrs, Pouglas refused lo let, them go, it being the Hying request of her husband tbat tbey should Jive with her, and that she should train them. up lo virtuo and .useful ness, nnd especially to love nnd, defend the Constitution nnd the Hag of their country. Collision—Soldiers Lost. The stoamer Bello Creole, bound from Cincinnati for Pittsburgh,- deeply laden, nnd Fre'estono, bound from Kanawha river for Cincinnati, with 400 of Col.

Tho concussion knocked oicht or ten soldiers into tho river from tho Freestone, and it is feared all of number but ono wero drowned. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. A Tribune special dispatch says that J no fear need be felt respecting the pd tionVofAhe Executive on tljej. seizure' of Mason and; Slidell. He wilT tale; as jho public:wflj learn "o'fficiallyi to-morrow, the same'gronnd ns.that upon which", tho aa lion'has settled, holding that Capt Wilkes' onlyeiTor wasjnnot.seizing tha TrMt also. Tho clerk of the House has received a letter from Mr. Ely, of New York, now a prisoner at Richmond, desiring his name put on the list, as he should be here to oc cupy his seat this session. A Union spy, who left here some three weeks ago for Richmond, arrived to day. : He..leftr.thealatter place, on Wednesday . last. He brings important intelligence, which he immediately communicated to our government. He says the greatest ex citement prevailed in Richmond, nnd thro' out tlio South respecting the naval and military expeditions,, along the entire Southern Coast. The troops from: the otaies mosfcexposeu uave sigoiueu iue bers had already started. In Richmond a few days before he left, much difficulty was experienced, in quelling a rebellious spirit among several regiments from Geor gia, South Carolina and Louisiana. They were restrained only by positive promises from Jeff. Davis nnd the Secretary of War that a sufficient number of troops should be dispatched from those Stales to not only protect the Slnles, but to drive tne Yankees from Southern soil. The Yii ginians, however, were indignant, and were threatening divers things against their Congress. There seemed to be, he says, n very general feeling among the Southern peo plo lo abandon Virgiuia entirely and nl luw her to fall into the hands of the Fed eral Government. They regarded it as too expensive to keep an army on her soil. The rebel hope now' is merely to keep bur' army from advancing into tho interior from their coast landings. Upon Iho renewed urgent"npplicaton of Georgo D. Prentice, oftbe Louisville Jour nal, Secretary Seward yesterday ordered the release of his brother-in-law, Calhoun, Benhntn, and also ex-Senator Givin, from Fort Lafayette. The report of the Secretary of the Na vy, after mentioning lbe capture of Messrs.. blidell and .Mason, says that the prompt nnU decisive action ot (Jnpt. Wilkes on this occasion merited and received the om phalic approval of the Department; nnd if a too generous forbearance was exhibit ed by him in not capturing tbe vessel which had those rebel embassies on board, it may, in view of the special circumstance and of its patriotic motives, be commended but it must by no means bo permitted to conslilute a precedent hereafter, for, the treatment of any case of a similar infrac tion of neu'rnl obligations by foreign, ves sels engaged in commerce or the carrying trade. A despatch to the Times says, Jesse D. Bright of Indiana, is here, and intends lo take his seat, in the Senate to-morrow, not withstanding his treasonable letter lo his excellency JelF. Davis, President of the Confederate Slates, recommending- the ndoption by ihnt rebel funciiotrary of an improved firearm, lo bo employed against the armies of the Union, Senator Powell, of Ky., also arrived this morning, and it is said intends taking his sent. In tbe case of Breckenridge and Burnett of Kentucky, thefr seats will probably be declared vacant; and it is thought by some that Senator Powell will bo 'called upon for'explanations. Senator Polk, of Missouri, is in the 'city, nnd will tnke his seat. In reference to the disloyal members it is proposed by many members of Congress to appoint a joint committee of Investiga tion to ascertain what have been the acts of tbe suspected parties, and wherever tho in vestigation shows overt acts of treason the report will recommend the expulsion of the parties from their seats. Mr. Vallandingham arrived to-day, nnd will probably have tho assurance to Ink bis seat to-morrow. Senator Bayard is here, but it remains to be seen whether he will carry out h pledges lo resign in case that he found that; his disaffection to the Union cause was not sustained by the people' of Delaware, now that the Slate has shown its loyalty to be so unquestionable.
