ROSSIA TREMBLING. THE STRIKE CONTINUES. Efforts to Turn the Agitation Into Peaceful Channels. gt Petersburg. Monday evening. Dec 4 (via fydtkfibTien. Dec. 6>.— Although there appears to be no foundation for the prevailing fears that tn outbreak is imminent, the population con tinues in a state of anxious suspense. The garrison has now been reinforced toy forty-two battalions of infantry, fifteen squad rons of cavalry and twelve machine gun bat teries. About sixteen thousand troops are on duty The city is divided into four districts and»r Generals Osaroff, Dubenski, Sterma and Trodski. respectively. Th» government, it is reported, narrowly frustrated a riot whereby a thousand armed mm had arranged to raid the State Treasury. Qpo , f • irators, it Js said, betrayed the ffet, whereupon the leaders, knowing that their ettack could be repulsed by the troops with grea-, slaughter, abandoned it. The existence of this conspiracy led to a report that martial law wouM h° proclaimed to-morrow (Tuesday), but this is authoritatively denied. Th? extension of the strike of the telegraphers j» the postal system is complete, and the paraJ ysis if business is increasing the danger of a financial crjsis- -^.«.^. ... The »trike of the Moscow telephone operators, ■who cut the wires and tor» up the poles, has severed the last means cf communication with th* ancient capital. Present conditions are unbearable. Sympathy with th« poorly paid poet and telegraph em ployes Js now Turning: into Indignation against the strikers, and the public is support ingr a termldable movement which has been started by ■n classes to throw off the yoke of the revolu tionaries. The government undoubtedly Js encouraging th« organization of these forces. The "Law and Orter" party took the lead, and is now being followed by the "Society c.f Strike Breakers," but the ir.ost important movement has been started under the leadership of Father (Japon, tbe former idol of the workmen, who since hiß residence abroad has become convinced that Russia 1s not prepared for a republic and is ap- PMlinß tr> his o;<1 comrades to rut loose from the revolutionary agitators. The latter already charge that Father fJapor has been bought and that h«= is a traitor to the cause of the peo»ls. Father Gapon. however, is sincere, and his infiu *nce undoubtedly If preat. This lieine p. holiday. Father Gapon attended •reelings of eleven of the organizations which he controlled before January 22 ("Red" Sunday), tt which hi« words were cheered to the echo. At these meetings the Socialist orators were fcowied down and Is some cases forcibly ejected. If this movement should grow and an effective •Plit sanong the workmen be created, it would prove of Immeasurable service to the govern "*nt in tiding things over until the meeting of tte Dcuma.

FIND SKULL AND BONES- POLICE UNEARTH CRIME. Tailor Tells of Tenderloin Murder Last New Year's. The Tenderloin added another chapter last night to its lon« list of secret crimes by giving up a human skull and a handful of bones that speak eloquently of a grewsome murder, prob ably preceded by robbery- The skull and bones ■were found late yesterday afternoon by De tectives Hawkins and Owens of the West 30thh st. police station, in the cellar of No. 112 West 26th-st. t formerly a notorious house conducted by a negro not unknown In the Tenderloin, and frequented by both negroes and whites. Beside the skull a bucket half full of lime was stand ing, and not far from it a huge hammer. There were bloodstains, too, on the floor and on the hammer, but almost Invisible to the naked eye. The skull and bones were taken to the Tender-, loin station and, were examined by Coroner Scholer, who afterwards said: , There is every evidence of foul play, though the body is in such a state of dissolution as to make It difficult to establish my claim. The skull, you can see, is badly decomposed: but the eyeballs are there, and there are still parti cles of flesh adhering to the bones. These facts prove that the body could not have been used for anatomical purposes. The skull is certainly a human one; of that I am perfectly satisfied. Whatever doubts one might have about the bones are shattered by the skull with its human eyes. The detectives called up Captain Dooley, and he hurried to the place. The rubbish was turned over and over, until twenty bones were col lected. Those, the- skull, -the-- -hammer and the half-filled bucket of lime were taken to the sta tion house, and the coroner's office was immedi ately Informed. Assistant IMstrlct Attorney Cordoza has already been assigned to the case. The police are of. the opinion that some on* was lured to the house and killed, after being robbed. Their theory is borne out by Antonio Pitrello, a tailor, of No. 315 West 26th-st.. di rectly opposite the house in which the skull was found. He says that It is the common talk of the neighborhood that some one was murdered in the house on New Year's eve, as he and others heard frightful screams and the noise of persons struggling in it that night Speaking in broken English, the tailor said: It was about 1O:3O o'clock that we first heard the trouble. Some one was shooting in front of my shop. I went out in the street and saw two men carrying another. They went into the base ment of that house over there, and no one ever saw them come out. The police came along shortly afterward and I told them all I knew. That's all anybody knew, and the affair was dropped. A week or so afterward an old man and a woman were at every door about here in quiring for the husband of the woman. They told me he had been missing since Christmas.^ I heard afterward that a man was robbed of $&X) and then butchered. Every person about here was talking of it. The house is said to have been rented by one Felix Fisher. He was dispossessed on charges of Captain Dooley. A negro named ESppa, stili travelling about the Tenderloin, managed the resort. He said last night that he had never heard of any murder being committed In tho house. MAY EXHUME BODY OF ROGERS.

PRESIDENT TO THE PEOPLE THROUGH CONGRESS. Som-c of the More Important Utterances on Topics of Especial Public Interest in the Message Transmitted Yesterday. Many subjects of much public interest and importance are treated in the mes sage of President Roosevelt to the 59th Congress, at its first session, transmitted to both houses and read yesterday. The President devoted especial attention to the consideration of the restraint of corporations, particularly in regard to the regulation of railroad rates; to the insurance question, labor problems, corruption of the electorate, peace as related to the Hague Conference, the construction of the Panama Canal, Santo Domingo and the Monroe Doctrine, tariff for revenue, economy in expenditures, currency reform, army and navy in relation to foreign policy, prevention and detection of breaches of public trust, public land laws, im migration, the Civil Service, food adulteration, national parks, the Indians, ,the Philippines, Hawaii, Porto Rico, Alaska, and to Statehood for Indian Territory and Oklahoma and for New-Mexico and Arizona. Some of the especially significant utterances of the message are given here with : So long as the finances oi the nation are kept upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which Congress has the power to deal be gins to approach in importance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the individuals — and especially the great corporations — doing an interstate business are to act. . . . It is gener ally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition, whether this re straint be reasonable or unreasonable; and where it is not useless it is gener ally hurtful. In my judgment, the most important provision which such a law (regulat ing railroad rates) should contain is that conferring upon some competent ad ministrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by n 'aihoad is reasonable and just, and if it !*rfotrrrd td tyeunreasonable and unjtfsY, then, after full investigation of the com plaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go — the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly called — this decision to go into , effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question (insurance), to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several States have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of these large cor porations take but small note of the ethical distinctions between honesty and dishonesty ; they draw the line only this side of what may be called law hon .esty, the kind of honesty necessary to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. There is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection in the methods of raising revenue : and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods render such a criange inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to determine the moment when the reasons for will "outweigh the reasons against such a change. . . . It is as yet too early to attempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for it is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should be considered whether it is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or in favor of any other nation maximum and mini mum tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure a' certain reci procity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Yet in speaking of economy I must in no wise be understood as advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut clown in the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fail to push forward all work on the Panama Canal would be as great a folly. , In political campaigns in a country as large and populous as ours it is in evitable that there should be much expense of an entirely legitimate kind. This, 'of course, means that many contributions, and some of them of large size, must be made. ... If they are extorted by any kind of pressure or prom ise, express or implied, direct or indirect, in the way of favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes not only improper but criminal. . . . All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any politi cal purpose should be forbidden by law ; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for any such purpose. That our rights and interests are deeply concerned in the maintenance of the (Monroe) Doctrine is so clear as hardly to need argument. This is espe cially true in view of the construction of the Panama Canal. As a mere matter of self-defence we must exercise a close watch over the approaches to this canal, and this means thai we must be thoroughly alive to our interests in the Carib bean Sea. We must ourselves in good faith try to help upward toward peace and order those of our sister republics which need such help. . . . Santo Domingo, in her turn, has now made an appeal to us to help her. and not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct within us bids us respond-to the appeal Our navy must, relatively to the navies of other nations, always be of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only be maintained but in creased. It does not seem to me necessary, however, that the navy should — at least in the immediate future— be increased beyond the present number of units. The question of immigration is of vital interest to this country. In the year ended hine 30. r<)Os. there came to the I'nited States 1.026.000 alien immi grants. . . . As I said in my last message to the Congress, we cannot have too much immigration of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. Two points about the (Panama) canal have ceased to he open to debate. First, the question of route; the canal will be built on the Isthmus of Panama. Second, the question of feasibility: there are no physical obstacles on this route that American engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious difficulty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within a rea sonable time and at a reasonable cost. The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. < >n this point I hope to lay before the Congress at an early day the findings of the Advisory Board of American ami European Kngineers. that at my imitation have been considering the subject, together with the report of the commission thereon, and such comments thereon <>r recommendations in reference thereto as may seem accessary. > (.Fir ruli text of Mcssase see Part 111^ I

BRIIHJE JAM WORST EVER Women Faint, Police Are Upset and Clothes Arc Torn. The worst block ever known at the Brooklyn Bridge kept the police busy for an hour last night around 6 o'clock trying to keep the crowd of jostling men from injuring women on the platforms. The crush was so great that six of the heaviest policemen were upset and swept along by the crowd. Clothing was torn, buttons were ripped off and several women swooned. The first the police knew of the trouble was when Roundsman Quinn, on the train platform, rang the alarm gong near the Park Row en trance. This is the signal of trouble on the platforms for outgoing bridge trains, and the policemen who patrol the trolley car loops at once made for the stairways. Captain Devanney and Roundsman Farrell were already there, but powerless to do any thing but shout for help. The trouble started with an accident to a bridge train as it was leaving the Brooklyn terminal. This blocked Taptain Devanney had the buttons ripped from his overcoat, which was nearly torn off his back, and many other men and women shared a similar fate. Women screamed and angry men shouted as if terror stricken. The crowd soon reached as far back on the balcon> platform as the stairways, and then the police stopped more from going up. Finally, after .1 half hour's delay, a bridge train came in. and was soon loaded and out again. The police say that the conditions at the Brooklyn Bridge' are daily growing worse and that they look for trouble every day during the rush hours. During this crush the guanl rail ings surrounding the balconies bend under the great strain. - . ■ - . FIST FIGHT IN CHURCH. Factions of St. John's, of Nets- Rochelie, Come to Bloxvs. The members of St. John's Episcopal Church, of Tpper New-Rochelle. held their annual elec tion for wardens and vestrymen yesterday morn- Ing The session opened with prayer and closed with a fight in which F. F. Whitehead. secre tary of the election, was struck in the ey by an ira*e parishioner. The trouble grew out of an effort which Is being made by a faction of the parishioners to oust the rector, the Rev. Hanson Bean. Charges were recently made against him. but when he wss brought to trial his accusers failed to prove them. \ The dissatisfied parishioners then tried to close up the church, and, failing in this, held up the rector's salary. Yesterday they turned out In full force, expecting to outvote him. Mr. Whitehead was chosen clerk of the elec tion and William H. Pawson one of the tell ers. Pawson is the leader of the faction which is opposing the rector. The voting proceeded quiet ly until the box was opened and it was found that twenty-two ballots had been cast, of which sixteen were for the ticket favoring tho reten tion of Mr. Bean. After angry words Pawson pulled off his coat and went at Whitehead in his shirtsleeves, cutting his face and knocking him down.-White head regained his feet and the two men clinched. The men in the church rushed in to separate them and the women screamed. Ex-Alderman Robert C Archer sprang between the men and pulled them apart. In the fight the ballot box was knocked over. «.,.«. Mr Whitehead said last night that, while he considered the assault unwarranted, he would not apply for a warrant, as he did not wan! .to bring any further notoriety to the church. His eye was badly swollen. SCHOOL PRINCIPAL REMOVED. Action of Troy School Commissioners Laid to Politics. [Fly Telegraph to The Trlbun-.l Troy. N. V., Dec. 5. — Martin H. Walwrath was to-day removed as principal of the Troy High School by the school commissioners on a party vote. The removal follows a hearing on charges of inc.ompete.ncy and insubordination preferred by Superintendent Edwin S. Harris. The .-harges were preferred shortly after elec tion, and the hearing: was marked by proced ures which called forth remonstrance. A citi zens' committee was appointed to obtain fair play, but its members were excluded from the. bearing: A great mass of testimony was taken, the evidence of high school teachers being 'm favor of the principal. It is openly charged lhat the motive behind the proceedings was re venge for Walwrath's independent vote at the last city election and his refusal lo be a party to "graft." The i-ase will be taken to the Supreme <"ourt.

COMMENTS ON MESSAGE MANY VARYING VIEWS. Chief Interest in Its Railroad Ratr; Sections. IFrom The Tribur.e Bureau! Washington. Dec. 5. — The Railway Rate sec tions of the President's message were, warmly commended by many members of the House and Senate, but were declared to be distinctly disap pointing by many more. Some of the radicals declared that the President had abandoned tha position he assumed a year ago ■when he recom mended that to the Interstate Commerce Com mission be delegated the authority to nrescriba specific rates. Others said that they lamented alleged modifications in the message. They wanted a provision authorizing the commission to fix water as well as railroad rates; and also a recommendation that the commission be em powered to fix a minimum as well as a maximum rate; and they deprecated the inclusion of a passage which is held to be virtually an Indorse ment of "traffic arrangements," where the Presi dent say*: "The power vested In the government to put 4 stop to agreements to the detriment of the public should, in my judgment, be accompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and careful supervision, agreements clearly In tha interest of the public." Such agreements, it is maintained by outspoken antagonists of tho railways, would not only h<* equivalent to those involved in the famous trans- Missouri case, which were declared illegal *>v the Supreme Court, but the expression of th* President constitutes, they maintain, a deflnit* Indorsement of the legislation proposed by 9rn ator Foraker. in which it was provided that th-% pnti-trjst law, which forbids "agreements In restraint of trade." should be so amended as 10 prohibit only "unreasonable" agreements i;i rt ..train of trade. Some of the radicals insist that, failing to confer on the Interstate Commerce Commis sion tha power to prescribe a minimum rate. Congress would leave that organization power less to remedy some of the most obnoxious dis criminations now practised, whereby certain cities axe now robbed of trade which naturally belongs to them, because of disproportionate rates. Conservatives in Senate and House, on ths other hand, object to the part of the President's statement that : We wish to insure as fair treatment for th« small town as for the big cities,— they arguing that while they all wish to s=e every one treated fairly, the statement is mis leading and is certain to be taken to mean that the small town shall be accorded the sama treatment as the big city, even though the big city be a large shipping point enjoying the ad vantages of being the terminal point of numer ous railroads and of water shipments. Excep tion is also taken to the statement: We do desire to see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong man shall be given no advantage over the weak man. It is said that literally this means that the shipper of goods by the carload shall enjoy no advantage over the shipper by the box or bar lel or bale, and that this is obviously imprac ticable. Great emphasis Is laid by the conservatives on the recomirendation that, where a railroad is detected granting to a favored shipper a rata lower than the established and reasonable rate, the coinmission'shall "have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maxi mum." It is urged by these "conservatives" that this recommendation, if put into practice, would hava the effect of penalizing every competing roal which had dealt honestly with its shippers for the fault of the one road which had violated the law; that a single road among several com petitors, prompted by dishonest management, might cut its rate between given cities to a point whk-h was far more profitable and even ruinous to competitors giving a high grade service, and that the commission, acting under this provision, would be compelled immediately to fon-e all competing roads to adopt the same ruinous schedule. Still another objection urged by the conserva tives is based on the statement: Klevator allowances shquld b<» stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demoralizing and a- use«l r.s rebates. It is ma'ntained that many <.f the elevators along the lines of railroads are private enter prises, that they ar." owned by individuals or companies, wholly distinct from the owners of the railroads, and that to abolish their right to charge for elevator sr-rvire would be simply con fiscatory. The conclusion of tlvit portion of the m»ssaar<i v.hich deals with the subject of corporations, in which the President declares that th? only cure for existing ev'ls is the regulation anil super vision ol corporations engagvtl in Interstate commerce by the national government, i* de clared to be an indorsement of Urn Mea pre sented In the last annual report <>f tne CoßHßts sioner of Corporations, in which he advocated that all corporations So engaged I-.- required to procure a federal license.
