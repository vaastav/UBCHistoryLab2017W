Ci)t Ctilntnt. MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1861. THE CRANE ARMY OF THE UNION, By a comparison of the list of Federal troops now in the field, from the several Slates, with the tables of population, it is found that the number from this Slate is about 5 per cent.; that is, five men in cvciy hundred in Illinois are now in arms for the defence o£ the Union. Indiana has one in 22, Kansas one in 23, and these States lead all the rest in this respect. lit tle Rhode Island heads the list of older States on the scabbard, she having contrib uted one man in 24. WHAT HAS BEEN GAINED ? On tbc 9th of November, by the gallant work of Com. Dupont’s blue-jackets, Gen. Sherman landed at Port Royal. Since that time nothing lias transpired, or next to that. We arc “ fortifying" there, of course, and there is talk of a machine shop, and re-openinc trade in notions with Yankee lar.d. We have a harbor of refuge and supply for our cruisers. We have a cotton port, though scarcely enough of that staple ha> yet been found to give it that title. But what has been gained in the direc tion of bringing South Carolina back to her allegiance, and to punishment for her miHlecds? What has been done in the direction which we have a right to suppose constitutes Gen. Sherman’s mission ? We may mistake the position of things, but wc venture the opinion that when our army comes to move from Port Royal it will be seen that the delay and dallying have given the South Carolinians time to do to Gen. Sherman precisely what a colony of bees do to a moth who has entered the precincts of the hive. They cannot oust him, but they cover him up and seal him over with wax. By this time, a cordon mill iaire of rebel batteries and camps bars our approaches to the interior in tiny direction. Planters have had time to fly from the Beaufort District and carry their negroes %viili them, leaving fire to do its work with the crops. The country is getting over its first had scare, and is using to our detri ment all the time we arc liberally affording them. Now suppose Gen. Sherman had hcen instructed to strike the soil of Sooth Carolina and use all his advantages. Are not these people the fierce and implacable enemies of the Government? Was it not almost within hearing distance, that the guns seven months ago broke the peace of the country, at Sumter? What was the call for delay, in a community whose dis p< >=ition was fully known by their acts ? Suppose that, on landing, Gen. Sherman had called all loyal men and slaves of rebels to his camps, armed and uniformed them. The panic would have run inland from Beaufort like a prairie fire. From all the plantations negroes would have poured into the Federal lines. Our army would have trebled in a week, and gathered strength as it advanced. Charleston ere this would have fallen. Savannah would have been ours, and the suffering and patient, but disheartened, loyal men of Ten nessee would have felt the thrill reach them across panic stricken Sccessia. To-day Gen. Sherman would have stood as a con queror, where now he merely occupies a command in a “fortified” position on the coast. Are not these facts? Is not this a fair picture of what might have been? What has stood in the way hut the sqneamish ness at arming the negroes, at putting mus kets into the hands'of the slaves of rebel masters, to maintain the Union. Gen. Gherman had it in his power to spread war and desolation through South Carolina. He was sent there for that purpose. The means lie ready at Ms hands and have not Men used. It was colored men, slaves of rebels, who drew the line of embankments about Sum ter. Blacks erected the works behind which Bragg now threatens Pickens. Blacks are now' entrenching Jeff. Thomp son at New Madrid. A regiment of 400 Macks are reviewed at New Orleans, to the delight of that city. Now are not these Scruples wrongly entertained in a cause of Such magnitude? Can the Government afford them ? Can the people afford them ? When are the managers of this war to commence its earnest work ? The greatest humanity is to make it quick, sharp, and terrible. Witness the slow tortures of the unhappy sections of the border States made the scene of rebel outrages. Is not dallying and delay in the management of the war, to the questionable humani ty of the surgeon who should spare Ms pa tient by the use of a dull knife, and by slow degrees of progress ? We have not sought this work of war. The desolation it will bring to homes, has not been invoked by ns. The rebels knowing all their own risks, accepted the fearful hazard. It is misplaced tenderness that turns back upon them the very men they are arming against ns, and refuses to em ploy, in behalf of the Union, the stout arms that have from the first been used in aid of the rebellion. CONFEDERATE CUKREXGV. The political economists, who, following the lead of the national confidence-man, Robert J. “Walker. Jlr. Polk’s Secretary of the Treasury, are predicting that the rebel Confederacy will be dissolved before Spring, by the impossibility of raising money with which to cany on the war, tire hiding their unwillingness to trust the power of our arms, behind a prophecy that lias no warrant in the history' of the past. And if they lull the country into a sense of security by pretending to tell when peace will be restored without striking a blow, they will do an injury which years of blood and tiol will not repair. The South is rich in resources, which are whol- ly at the command of the rebel rulers, and the acumen of the chief officer of the Confederate Treasury, which we lately had occasion to notice, will so manage his £ul>stitutes for money, that, unless we arc active and bold, the patience of the com mercial world will be exhausted, and our blockade raised before 3lr. Memminger’s financial system will break down. The notes of the conspirators now pass freely from hand to hand; they are much below par and will unquestionably continue to decline; but a long road, unless our victo- rics are hastened on,must begone over be fore they will cease to discharge the pur pose for "Which they were devised. Their circulation has thus far l>ecn voluntary; ns long as their aggregate is not largely in creased, they will still be counted as money; and when, in that real despotism, the exi gencies of the bad cause demand that ad ditional tens of millions be put into the market, there yet remain the old resources of tyranny—a compulsory circulation, and I military requisitions —for supplying the I enemy’s 'wants. Of course the coming of | disaster and bankruptcy is only a question of time. The endurance of the people trill, by and by, be too severely taxed; the de mand for real values will become impera tive, and then the system goes down "with a crash. But the optimists-who are quietly hoping for that consummation, do not see either side of the single point upon which their eyes are fastened. *The question is, “Will the world he content, while wanting cotton, to wait for the operation of economical causes to end this war—for the South, in a two or three years' struggle, to prove that Adam Smith was not a fool ? Let us sup pose this nation a neutral, while other pow ers are combatting, and in our wants and impulses, thus circumstanced, we shall at once find a clue to what England and Prance will do. No, our safety lies in ac tion,which, by convincing the men of the South that their cause is hopeless, will ruin She credit of their Confederate currency; and which, by proving our earnestness and ability to the world, will insure a respect for the blockade, upon which the easy con quest of the rebels depends! Gunpowder is that which will blow up the rebel finan cial system. THE OLD ANIMUS* It will be observed, that the men who are now making an unseemly clamor oyer Mr. Cameron's recommendation embodied in the suppressed Report, are those who came reluctantly and with evident misgivings to the defence of the country when the war broke out. The editor of the New York Herald would not show the Ameri can flag after Sumter fell, until his office was threatened by a mob; and the Times in this city, as well as the Free Press in Detroit? went through an almost similar discipline. The reluctance in each case to see that the country's cause was worth defending, grew out of the fact that the managers of the papers of which we speak, loved slavery more than they loved the Uniou; and though professing great loyalty to-day, there are abundant reasons for believing that the old animus is the cause of their outcrv now. Again, the fact will not escape our read ers that the newspapers which find lurking Abolitionism in the cautious recommenda tions of the President’s Message, in relation to the disposition to be made of the escaped slaves of rebel masters, are those winch were seized with spasms of horrorand rage when the first contingent of 75,000 men was called out. These papers were mainly in the border slave States, and among them the Louisville Journal was then, as it is now, the most conspicuous. Who does not remember its indignation and grief when the defence of our flag against the rebel armies became a necessity? Who does ; not remember that it gave the President the option to he considered a madman or a fool, and that it then threatened more direful things than it threatens now, if what it called the nefarious policy were not changed? The trouble with all these journals and the men for whom they speak, is, in a greater degree, that which torments the New York Herald. They are content when the signs show that the tide of war will not touch the institution that has bred this in fernal mischief; but that being threatened, ?y halt and waver. Their’s is a divided loyalty—the root of their proposed neutral ity ; and their influence upon the powers that be is one of the causes that has made the war so fruitless in good results. There are more than 600,000 true men in the field; not one of whom docs not burn to make tliis a short, quick, and on our part, a triumphant struggle. Cannot we not afford towage war as the Republic de mands, and not, as heretofore, in a way to quell the fears and tickle the ‘‘conserva tism ”of the Border States ? The country is right; why then, condemn men who were loyal from the first, to follow the slow motions of the semi-secessionists who yield ed to the fear of physical force before their patriotism could be discovered at all ? TBtOGE 

POOR REAR BEEN. In what, is not to them their “loved lit tle isle,” just off the good city of Boston, arc two men than whom not another pair are more identified with the great infamies of the rebellion. They were “ taken in the very act.” For years they have been work ing in this conspiracy. They represent a system and principles the antipodes of Bos ton. They have no sympathy with aught that pertains to the prosperity and peace of the capital of New England. Massachu setts men have have shed their blood at Bull Run, and Ball’s Bluff, through the trea son of these men. Massachusetts homes to-day are mourning their first bom sons, slain in battle, or by thousands sojourning in winter camps, and all this because of the traitorous conspiracy in which these labored. Now there arc common decencies to be observed in all these cases. Because the trea son was a blow aimed at the hearts and homes of Boston; because our Southern brethren would do and are doing their best to cut the throats of Massachusetts men, it would for this reason be proper for her citizens to turn out and tear these men from Fort Warren, were that possible, and barbecue or lynch, them a la Dime’s land, and Massachusetts will contemplate no such thing. But it is not more a decency in Boston snobs, the flutter into which they have been thrown by the importation of these distin guished southern rebels. Such first class Southerners, such poor dear men, —Boston flunkeyism is moved to the core and centre, and baskets of champagne and hampers of goodies, and packages of toilet cushions, slippers and dressing gowns arc the result. There is u sweetness in woman’s tender ness for an enemy, hut, really, arc not the Boston Mrs. Jellyhys carrying the tMng too far? Mothers in the Bay State arc weep ing over their desolated homes; Bay State merchants arc lamenting their own ruin, and her manufacturers their impending bankruptcy. Is it a time for Boston, even Boston snobbery, to aid the authors of all these woes to fine wines, wherewithal that they may drink to the defeat of the Union, and viands that they may fare sumptuously every day? The order of Congress has come timely, but not in tiiffe to redeem these Boston matrons from, a folly they should be ashamed of. LET SLAVERY FEEL THE WAR. The Christian Intelligencer —for a gene ration the organ of the Reformed Dutch Church in this country, and an exceedingly cautious, conservative journal—has a strong leader this week entitled “ Slavery against the Government,’’ in which its edi tor, the Rev. E. S. Porter, takes decided ground in favor of recognizing slavery as the mainspring of the rebellion, and treat ing it accordingly. Says the editor: “ From the beginning of the civil war until now. Slavery bag supported the rebel army, and opera tedas the soul of the great conspiracy against Na tional life and liberty. These things being bo. it becomes a question of no merely momentary inte rest, What ought the Government to do with Slavery now? What policy, if any, should the loyal men of the country adopt respecting the fu ture treatment of this insurgent National cancer? The replv which onsht, in our judgment, to be made to these questions, is this: Sine* Star-fry made (tie tear. Ul Slavery feet (he }rar —not by in citing servile insurrections, whose many and name less atrocities would outrage humanity, hut by cchfifcativg the flare* of all rebel masters, so soon ae they can be reached, and by using them as hired laborers until the rebellion is crushed, in part by tbeir aid. Thus the power of Slavery would be rightfully used against itself. Thus the issue which the rebel conspirators have tendered the Government would be precisely met as tendered, and the ultimate decision of this controversy would prove itself plainly in favor of ultimate emancipation.” PtBGE THE PRISONS, The evident disposition of Congress to make clean -work of the infamous legisla- i tion and tiie more infamous practices, which have disgraced the nation, in the District of Columbia, tv ill cany joy to the heart of every man to whom the inestimable guar antys of personal liberty are not a farce That black men alone have been subjected to the Neapolitan code winch slavery, in the District, has demanded for its pro tection, does not, among white men who I' are mindful of human rights, relieve the Republic of the opprobrium which has been heaped upon it by the laws ot which we speak. It has been a grievous stain upon our national honor that, within the shadow of the flag which floats from the dome of the Capitol, men and women should be sold like beast* in the market-place; but it is a deeper reproach that men born free, should, for the first time, have the chains of bond* age riveted upontiremiutkgyeiyijejirtof a Democracy. Every brick in the walls of the buildings used for local courts, and eveiy stone in the prisons, could, if not voiceless, tell a tale of injus tice and woe. compared with, which the atrocities of Venice and Naples would be diminished. Black men only suffered, and the world laughed, but Heaven listened and sent the penalties. The rebellion was conceived and fostered in that spot where tyranny was nursed and .fed; and the men here and everywhere in the North, who would not heed what their representatives were doing, or heeding would not reprove, must now fly to arms to protect themselves from that despotism which they refused to nip in the bud. This is a world of com pensations. Let us hope that the iniquities of those statutes and those prison houses will be uncovered, and that before' Congress ad journs, It will bo impossible to but a. mak in the District of Columbia, and that the seal of a purified Democracy may be put on the closed gates of the baracoons from which women were sold for purposes of lust! The U* 8. Sanitary Commission* The Sanitary Commission’s Report of their operations embrace Information of great and permanent. value, though necessarily too voluminous. The Commission has furnished supplies to 116 regimental and 10 general hospitals in Washington and vicinity. Thousands of articles of all sorts, worth SSOO, have been distributed daily on an average, to the Potomac army. The whole value of distribution there in No vember was SII,OOO, and in the whole army $30,000. In more than three-quarters of the regiments native Americans arc in the majority. The Germans are in the majority in only six. The Irish in only five out ol a hundred. Nearly two-thirds of the army are Americans. Nine tenths are citizens. The average age of pri vates is over 24 years. Three-fourths arc sin glc men. Five men in a hundred are without blankets, most probably having worn theiris out. A quarter of the blankets are of poor qualty. The men are generally well provided; if not, it is the consequence of their own carelessness, or the gross negligence of officers. The men arc almost universally satisfied with their ra tions, both in quality and quantity. Captains now uniformly draw for rations, and generally in proper form. The cooking is greatly improved. About forty per cent, of the regiments there form company funds. Three months ago only one regiment of the volunteers did. This indicates the formation of regular camp habits. In eight out of the twenty regiments the sutlers charge fixed prices. They are generally exorbitant. The army regulations on the subject arc uniformly dis regarded. There is little drunkenness except on pay day, and leave of absence there is less than in other armies. There is too much gambling after pay-day. In seven-eighths of the regiments there are competent surgeons. The health of the volunteers is not so good as that of the regulars. The average number of sick in the whole army is 77 in 1,000. The average deaths monthly Is 3 in 1,000. Colored Emigration to Haytl, Mr. Ecdpath, the Haytien Emigration Agent at New Tork, announces that about two thou sand free colored persons have already emi grated to that island under the auspices of his Bureau, and that large colonies are forming in Michigan, Southern Ohio, Canada, and Pen nsylvania, and will embark in the course of the coming winter and next spring. Vessels are to sail from New Tork on December 18th, January Ist, January 16th, etc. Several letters have recently been received from the colonists at St. Mark, and as they speak of their pros pects in most encouraging terms, they cannot fail to give a great impetus to the movement. At tliat town they have already established churches, Sunday schools, and a literary insti tution, and everything appears to indicate a healthy state of progress. Quincy and the Armory. The citizens of Quincy have now started up in the race for the location of the National Ar mory, and have held a public mutual admira tion meeting, which appointed a committee to proceed .to 'Washington and log-roll in the matter. Wc have now, besides Chicago, the following places all putting in for the Armory: Kock Island, LaSalle, Springfield, Quincy, Burlington, and a half-dozen other towns along the upper river. Tbeir purpose is to defeat the West in getting the Armory, and to throw its location into the lap of Pittsburg. The organization of the Congressional Com mittee is already too largely in the Pennsylva nia interest to admit a serious division in the West. If the Armory docs not come to Chi cago it will go to Pittsburg. That seems to be settled.. All the other Western claimants arc, therefore, indirectly aiding Pittsburg to bear off the prize. The National Capital will about as soon be located at cither Quincy, La- Salle, Springfield, etc., as that the new Na tional Armory shall be. Indiana Troops for Kentucky. The Indianapolis Journal, of the 6th, says that all the Indiana regiments anywise near full, will be ordered into the field in a few days, and to Kentucky. There are some ten or twelve of them. Gen. Buell’s army ap proaches a total of 100,000 men. It is every* way the finest, as it is the hugest, army hi the field under one commander, alwaj'S excepting Gen. McClellan’s force on the Potomac. Shall wc have something done in Kentucky ? 55?“ One Cephas Bcaumals, a native of Mar tinique, who has, through a course of years, committed gigantic forgeries in the United States, is now imprisoned in Philadelphia for his crimes. His operations have extended through a long series of years, and the amount he has realized from Ms adroit rascality is es timated at two hundred thousand dollars. Among other extensive operations in the West it is stated that in 1855 or thereabouts, he succeeded in duping St. Louis and Chicago firms to the amount of £25,000, or SIOO,OOO, by forged bills. To R. K. Swift & Brothers, of this city, he sold a forged draft for £2,800 sterling, receiving in return bills of exchange on the Bank of England. Being unknown in Chicago, the firm employed a detective officer to follow Beaumals. HLs suspicious conduct and his sudden flight to Canada aggravated their fears, and finally he was overtaken at an obscure town in Canada West. pgr On the Grand Trunk Railway on the 24th nit, while the cars were under full head way, a gentlemanly appearing individual came up the aisle, and without saying a word drew a revolver, and fired three times at a stranger, sitting on the seat with a Mr, McLeod. Of course he was instantly killed. The assassin called himself McDonald, and said both him self and man killed were Scotchmen. He appeared to take the matter very coolly, pro ducing a cigar, and lighting it as if nothing had liappcucd. The conductor and another person took charge of liim. gg* The enemy arc so thick around Romney, Va., that be who steps outside the- entrench ments is nabbed as a prisoner. In this way two Lieutenants were caught, last Tuesday, and of a squad of cavalry sent-out to recover them, one was also made prisoner. The ne groes have little inducement to befriend our unlucky soldiers and smuggle them back into camp, since Gen. Kelly has treated those that rendered such service, so shabbily. Kelly bugs bis u entrenchments,” and he and lus command nre’pcrfcctly safe. The steamer Golden State, which left Paducah on Friday evening last, was met at Cavc-in-Rock, by a messenger, who Informed Capt. King that there was a body of six hun dred rebels at Caseyville, awaiting the arrival of his boat and the Charley Bowen, intending to seize them on their arrival. The Golden State immediately put back to Paducah, when Gen. Smithordercd a gunboat with two hun dred infantry and a company of cavalry, to proceed to Cascyville to dislodge the rebels. Example is catching, especially among the ladies. Mrs. Lincoln, in doing her last shopping at New York, carried home her own handles; and now it is “fashionable” for ladies to do it. Mrs. Gov. Morgan, attending Gough's lecture at Albany, occupied a promi nent scat and knit all the evening on her sol dier's sock. At the nest lecture all the wo men brought their knitting work. At Paducah on the 4th, a sad accident occurred in raising a cannon. The machinery gave way and a thirty-two pounder fell, crush ing the limbs of three men in a frightful man ner. One of the 11th, Mr. Kearns, had one limb smashed, and the other broken in two places. He died in a few hours. The others arc doing well; one* with a leg amputated, another with both legs broken, one in two places. ggf Charles Gibson, Esq., arrived at St. Louis on Thursday last from Washington,with a Treasury draft for $250,000 in favor of Gov. Gamble, to be used in payment of the Mis souri State troops. Anns and equipments for 7,000 men have been sent by Gen. Meigs, to St. Louis, for the use of the State troops, and they arc daily looked for to arrive. t5T* Not a single United States soldier now remains in Utah, and the travel across the plains is much diminished. There is no trouble whatever between the Mormons and the citi zens of the State. The National Electric Tele graph passes through the Territory, and it is a matter of boast with Brigham that it is scru pulously protected from injury. Each company of the proposed regi ment of artillery at Racine, Wis., Is now being organized as a distinct battery, of which there will be some eight or ten in aIL Two batter ies (Captains Foster and Herzberg,) will start for Baltimore in a few days, and the others will follow to Kentucky or Missouri. EBTThe Worcester Spy counts np about, one thousand mechanics in that city, .engaged directly upon Government work --gun car riages, fire-arms, ride barrels, machinery for gunboats, etc. OUH WASHINGTON LETTER. The President’s Message • Judge Trombull’s Confiscation Act* [From Our Own Correspondent.'] Wabhibotok. Dec. 5,1661. The President’s Message is variously com mented upon. All agree that it is eminently a business-like document. The observations concerning the Supreme Court, and the plans recommended for its reorganization, are very much liked. So also are the views presented concerning a revision of the statutes, the es tablishment of Courts in the rebellious States and Territories for the collection of debts, and the changes proposed for the Court of Claims. The condition of the Treasury, so for as it is treated by the President, is regarded in every respect healthy and encouraging. On the .other hand, there arc those who do not see how the Government can receive the slaves of rebels from Maryland, or Kentucky, or Missouri, 44 according to some mode of val “ nation in lieu, pro tanto , of direct taxes nor do they understand how these slaves, after being discharged from the only claim which holds them, can be still retained by some other power or claim, and used as tallies, or checks, or “chips,” in settling acashaccount between a State and the General Government. Per haps the President merely intended, by this means, to encourage the Legislatures of Mary land, Kentucky and Missouri to adopt the policy of emancipating or confiscating the slaves of disloyal citizens. Indeed, this Is the only intelligible explanation of the scheme, for it Is absurd to suppose that, after a person has been discharged from the only service or labor which he is supposed to owe, he still owes something to the State, or belongs In fee simple to the State, or cau be lawfully used as currency by the State. Hie reticence of the President on the sub- ject of slaves in their connection with the war a subject which Secretary Cameien deems the most important of all—is much comment-* cd upon. Senator Trumbull’s bill to confiscate rebel property, etc., engages much attention. It has not yet been printed, but I am enabled to furnish the readers of the Tribune with la pretty fall synopsis of it: Section one provides that all property, real or personal, within the United States, belonging to any person, whether in or out of the juris diction of the United States, who has taken up arms against the Government, or has aided or abetted, or who shall aid or abet, the present rebellion against the same, shall be confisca ted and forfeited to the United States. Section two provides that every person having claim to the service or labor of any other per son, in any State, under the laws thereof, who during the present rebellion shall take up arms against the United States or in any man ner aif or abet said rebellion, shall thereby forthwith forfeit all claim to such service orla- Lor, and tlie persons from whom it is claimed to be due, commonly called slaves, shall, ipso factor on the commission of the act of forfeit ure, by the party having claim to the service or labor aforesaid, be discharged therefrom and become forever thereafter free persons, any person of any Shite or of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding; and itshall be the duty of the Presi dent of the United States to make pro : vision for the transportation, colonization and settlement in some tropical country beyond the limits of the United States of such per sons of the African race made free by the pro visions of this act, as may be willing to emi grate, having first obtained the consent of the Government of said country to their protec tion and settlement within the same, with all the rights and privileges of freemen. Section Hire# provides for seizure and confis cation by military power when beyond the reach of civil process. Section four provides that the fund arising from such confiscation shall be applied, first, to the reimbursement of such loyal persons as may have been despoiled of their property by the rebellion, and, second, to the payment of the public debt incurred by the United States in the suppression of said rebellion. Section jive provides for the protection of loyal citizens in the rebel States from the op erations of the act. Sttifou six provides for judicial proceedings in District Courts of the United States, for the execution of the provisions of the act. Section seven provides for the forfeiture of the personal property of persons duly tried and convicted of treason. The difference between the first and seventh sections of the Act is, that the former operates upon the property of rebels whose persons arc not within our jurisdiction, while the latter conforms to that clause of the Constitution which contemplates the punishment of the person of the traitor by execution, and in view of that punishment forbids the confiscation of Ills real property beyond the period of his own life. __ 

LATE NEWS IN BRIEF. The Republicans of New Hampshire have called their State Convention at Concord, January let, and the Democrats hold their’s January Sth. Both will nominate party tickets, the Republicans, of course, keeping Gov. Berry at their head. —Joseph Hoxie — ll old Joe” —who was the Republican candidate for County Clerk of New York, iu November, aud beaten, made a speech at a Gunther meeting, in which he said he wasn’t a second time to be caught voting for the lowest candidate in a three- cornered race with Fernando Wood, and hav- ing voted for Opkyke, two years ago, he should now profit by that experience, and vote for Gunther! Opdyke was elected. The Evening Post now says: Jlr. Joseph Hoxtc. it is said, will leave town for a few days, till the thing blows over. Hia vocal organs, too. require a little relaxation. —Accompany of ninety-six mounted men, representing every county of Pennsylvania, and recruited at Carlisle Barracks as a body guard for Gen. Anderson, (then in command in Ken tucky.) have passed down the river to Louis ville, and will be the body guard of Gen. Buell. They are commanded by Capt. Palmer, of Philadelphia, formerly Secretary to J. Ed gar Thomson, President of the Central rail road. —The Ohio 4th aud sth cavalry. Colonel Kennett and Taylor, have been ordered to pro ceed at once to Louisville, although unarmed as yet; and all the other Ohio cavalry regi- ments, five in number, are ordered to rendez vous at Camp Dennison, Cincinnati. The Nebraska PepnWcan calls for a sepa- I rate Land Surveyor’s district to comprise that Territory, because the present district, under Surveyor Mark W. Delahay, is 100 wholly a Kansas affair. The Nebraska lands are not I surveyed so as to invite immigration, and in deed Mr. Delahay encourages all the immigra tion to, Kansas at the expense of the other. | —The 13th Indiana has been ordered from Huttonville to Beverly, leaving the 14th alone to occupy the former place during the winter. The men have been building log houses for their accommodation, and arc quite well pro vidcdlfor. There are four houses to each com pany, with a corporal to each, and separate quarters for the commissioned officers. Hut tonville had but three houses when the troops first came there; now there arc seventy-five, I and the place is quite a thriving military Til- 1 I lage, only there is an alarming dearth of fc [ male society—Boo men to one woman. Food is plenty, and is well cooked. A singular addition to chiropodic science has been made in the Guthrie Gray regiment’ 1 in service in Western Virginia, where they were for weeks at a time with wet feet. Their j feet had been so thoroughly soaked that every com aud bunion iu the regiment was killed. 1 We mention this curious fact for the benefit j of those troubled in this manner, and hope that every man so afflicted will immediately 1 enlist. Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, has a bill on slavery, ■which will come up for action next Tuesday, which differs materially from the proposition offered on Monday by Mr. Thad dcus Stevens, of Pennsylvania. The promi nent feature of the Stevens proposition is that it encourages the slaves to insurrection, or rather to join the Federal army. Mr. Bingham proposes to avoid this objection by providing for the confiscation of aU the property of rebels, or of any persons aiding the rebellion, and for the absolute freedom of all slaves of such persons. A clause also provides for the punishment of all army or navy officers who shall arrest or return fugitive slaves. Gen. Rosecrans, at Wheeling, is looking about among the houses of runaway rebels for his winter establishment. He has examined the houses of C. W. Russell, (member of the Richmond convention,) E. H. Fitzhngh, and Dr. Stanton, (now in Mississippi,) and rather prefers the latter. His staff are with him, and his family will soon arrive from Ohio. Lieut. Jefferson C. Davis, one of the Fort Suinter garrison, went to Missouri as Colonel of the 23d Indiana; was appointed Brigadier- General by Fremont; and the Governor thereupon appointed officers for the regiment. Fremont’s appointments being revoked by the War Department, Davis has lost both his Col onelcy and Generalship. Coh Wyman, of Illi nois, was likewise named a Brigadier by Fre mont, but as the assumed vacancy in the com mand of the regimentwas not filled, he returns to his former position, safe and sound, although still acting in the capacity of Brigadier. —James D. Pulley, the secession member of the Illinois Legislature from Williamson county, arrested some time since, defends himself State Bfgislcr in this wise: - I desire that every word in relation to my being or having been, or at any time In my life intending to be.

ARMY CORRESPONDENCE. FROM FORT HOLT, KENTUCKY. A correspondent writing from Fort Holt, below Cairo, on the Kentucky shore, after de tails of the adventure of thcrebel gunboats a few days since, says: What their object was in paying ns this visit wo arc unable to say, but believe it more to try the range of our guns than anything else; it may have been meant to return a com pliment onr gun boats have frequently paid them to Columbus, and perhaps to inform ns that the celebrated Hollins fleet bad arrived, and were ready to receive the earliest attention of onr boats. Whatever may have been their object they soon found the upper waters of the Mississippi, although in a high latitude, altogether too hot for them, and made good their retreat towards Columbus, to the music of sixty-lbur pound balls closely following after, stirring within the souls of all on board, I presume, the liveliest Jmaguia- ! tion as to the source of those charming: sounds. Hid our gun-boats been at hand, or our sixty-four pound columbiad, furnished with the proper cartridges, they would have met with a much warmer reception than they did. As it was, however, they did_ not see fit to prolong their stav. At this pointwe have now the 7th and 28th regiments of Illinois vol unteers, Colonels Cook and Johnson; Capt. Delano’s and one other company of cavalry, and Capt McAllister’s company of light ar tillery. Our winter quarters are nearly com pleted, and add greatly to onr comfort and convenience, especially when the weather is as cool as it has been for the past two weeks. How long we shall occupy them is very un certain, but we are not particular about a long stop if they will only start ns out in the right direction. Wc prefer a wanner climate, es pecially at this season of the year. FROM THE ELKVKNTff MICHIGAN. A few days since, among our news matter, appeared some reference to the Eleventh Mich igan now in camp at White Pigeon, Michigan, taken from onr Detroit exchanges. Although this statement has already been made, accom panying a communication from that point, we give place to the following from a correspond ent at that point; No regiment in the State has been recruited more rapidly, or filled up to the requisite number. As to the cost, that is all moonshine. No regiment has been recruited at less ex pense to the General Government; while the delay has been occasioned solely by the Gov ernment in not famishing the required arms and clothing when ordered. As soon as full, an order was made on the Quartermaster General for clothing, who turned it over to the contractors; but these failed when only half supplied. From that time forward, our Colonel has worked assiduously to complete the balance, but not until last week was this effected. The number on the sick list is also erroneously stated. After careful examination I find not 50 out of some 1,200 men, and most of these of a mild type, that will not prevent them going forward with the regiment. The story oT Captain Smith is also equally false with the other statements. It is true that some 60 men under that officer were transferred to the Governor of the State, a month or so ago, but they were men enlisted as mechanics, and of course not wanted by Col. May, and I understand have since been disbanded. Now, Messrs. Editors,permit me to say that the Eleventh is all right; that no bet ter troops are to be found in the State; that they have for over six weeks been ready and anxious to more, and oulv prevented from do ing so by not being supplied by the Govern ment with the necessary arms” and clothing: but that now ail these have been supplied,*ud that it will move for Kentucky on Monday, and be first and foremost, (if possible) in driV ing the wicked traitors from off the soil of the Union. You may wager your hat that the 11th Michigan Infantry will do their whole duty and be a credit to the Peninsular State. A STATEMENT FROM HOLLA. Ho lxx, Missouri, Nov. 99,1861. Editors of Chicago Tribune; My attention was this day called to “rt Commit siouer'it Slatei/ient,” dated at Bclvidcrc, Illinois, Nov. 9th, IS6I, published in the Norlhicatsrn Chn.'lion Advocate of Thursday, Nov. 20th, 1361, and signed by I>. H. Whitney. The object of this communication is to correct the false statements made by the writer, and im pressions likely to be made upon the public mind from the said Commissioner's statements. In this article I will only make mention of things the command to which lam attached arc interested in, leaving the 14th and 15th regiments to answer for themselves, although I know the writer has misrepresented and done great injustice to them as well as the 13th. lie says he found the regi ments ** favorably located, with an abundant sup ply of water of excellent quality.' 1 The 13th regiment went into camp at Disou, on the 9th of May. were sworn into the United States service on the 241h of May, left Dixon on the 16th of June for Caseyville, opposite St. Louis, lay en camped at Cascyville until the afternoon of the sth of Jnlv, when wc broke up camp, aud arrived at Holla on the morning of the 6th. A large quantity of arms, ammunition and sup plies were storedin the depot warehouses, waiting for transport wagons and mules, to enable us to forward them to General Lyon's command then at Springfield. We were sent here to guard these annv stores, and to do so were compelled to encamp near the depot, where there was no water but the scanty supply obtained from wells which were drained day after day. The men would descend to the bottoms of the wells, and with tin cups dip up the last drop of mud and water in them to obtain what was absolutely necessary for drinking and cooking purposes, and then the supply was short even of this had quality. So much for mis statement number one. , He says the supplies of certain kinds of medi cines are insufficient for treatment of the type of disease prevailing among the soldiers, and men tions. opium, quinine and astringents. Iu reply to this statement I wish to say: I have never been short of these medicines, and have never made a requisition on the Medical Purveyor of this division of the army for these or any other medi cines allowed In the army supply table, that I did not get promptly and in the quantity asked for. He says soldiers are put upon half rations on en tering the hospital. &c. Soldiers on the sick list are allowed full rations, and what they do -not consume goes to constitute a part of the hospital fund. The quality, quantity, andkind they eat are matters entirely under con trol oft he Surgeons. With us there has at no time been a lack or provisions, hut we have been lim ited in variety from want of the hospital fund to which wc are entitled. As to clothing, allow me to say, every private in the 13th£regimeut received a suit, consisting of a coat or jacket, pantaloons, shirts, socks, shoes, and caps, from the county iu which the company was enlisted. The State gave a bounty of six dol lars (to be invested in clothing) to every private, and in addition to the bounty, gave every private a coat, pants, hat. two sliirtsl two pair of drawers, two pair of socks, and a pair of shoes—also gave to the regiment six hundred oil-cloth blankets for spreading ou the ground to sleep on. and ninety overcoats for the use of the guards iu wet weather and cold nights. Within the last few days onr men have been new uniformed again, with jackets, pants, drawers, shirts, socks. shoes, overcoats, and caps ; the last were furnished by the United States. Now, I ask any sane person if this looks like clothing our soldiers with rags. On onr arrival at Holla on the 6th of July. Col. Wyman was ordered to and took command of the Eostj; an old two-story log house near the depot e occupied as his headquarters; up to the return of the soldiers after the battle at Wilson's Creek, hi? office was on the lower floor. When the army came in from Springfield the ammunition and part of the arms they brought back were stored in this lower room, and his office moved up stairs to the room iminediat ely over it; then, and not be fore. was a guard stationed at the door; his busi ness was to guard the ammunition and arms, and not the entrance to Gen. Wvman's office. Subsequently a large lot* of clothing, saddlery, and other army equipages were stored in another room on the ground floor. There was a window (the sash and glass of which were non est) in the room, bnt out of sight of the guard at the door. Therefore a second guard was posted at the win dow to prevent the things from being stolen. The third guard he mentions is a myth—a thing that never existed. I>. H. Whitney was hunting for “ red tape." and thought he found it in these guards, when the truth is. this D. H. Whitney was a novice, and had not learned how to visit n military headqnarters. or encampment, and from what I can learn never did pass the guards of the 13th regiment. I never saw him that I know of. nor did my assistant, and at no time have we both been absent from the reg iment. 3 cannot find a private or officer in the regiment who was aware of his presence at Holla, except the Chaplain, and he offered to accompany and introduce him to Gen. Wyman, but as that would spoil the “redtape” yam. he declined. To talk of “pomposity and red tape." In connection with General Wyman, is simply ridiculous, and there is no one acquainted with him but knows how absurd such charges arc. He is all sociality and affability, and with these qualities has the great faculty of commanding the respect and esteem of the men under him. as any onejwill perceive by passing through the camp, where such signs are painted on the tent doors as -Wyman Mess, “Wy man Hotel," W“yman Headquarters." &c.. &c. My opinion Is that D. H. Whitney visited his son in the 15th Keeiment, at the expense of the State of Illinois, and that his reports are mere hearsays, not obtained from authentic sources, or oven the result of his own observations. As an Hlinoieiau. I am proud of my State. She has done noblv. not only in furnishing volunteers, but in equipping them and keeping watch over their welfare. The untiring zeal of Governor Yates is too well known to ail to require comment from me. and we know that in constituting this “Commissioner." his object was the welfare of the soldiers: but onr soldiers, who arc intelligent, reading men. agree with me that the money ex pended on the mission of D. H.'Whitney would have been better invested had it been put into the hospital fund. With regard to the hospital arrangements of the ISth (a matter in which I am directly interested),, it is due to those having the control of affairs at Springfield to say that before we left our noble State, we were supplied with the finest hospital tent I ever saw. also with camp cots, mattresses, bed sacks, pillow ticks, blankets, sheets, pillow cases, towels, cooking utensils, table furniture, and everything else in the way of hospital supplies necessarv for the comfort of the sick. The ISth regiment, when fullest, numbered one thousand ana one men. Nine have died of disease, one was instantly killed by accidental discharge of a gun. and twenty-four have been discharged from sendee on account of chronic diseases ana troubles exist ing before they were mustered in. To-day we number nine hundred and sixty-seven men, and I am fully satisfied that no other regiment, having served the same length of time, can begin to show the same proportionate number of efficient force. And in the face of all this. D. H. 'Whitney says wc have“lcssonthesickUst.bat more deaths than both the others 1 ' (meaning the 14th and 15th), the latter danse of which sentence I take the respon sibility of pronouncing slanderous and untrue. He has a great deal to sav about the Brigade Hos pital and the condition of ihc sick left there, when our forces were ordered to rn»rrh. Doctor Derby. Brigade Surgeon, had only arrived at the post, had made no preparation, for he had not had time to make any, and had not yet received bis supplies, when we were compelled to turn our sick overto him. I left eleven men his charge, and with the eleven left twenty-five cot bed steads, eleven pair of splendid woolen blankets, eleven sheets, eleven bed ticks, (one freshly filled,) eleven pillow ticks, (freshly filled,) and eleven linen pillow cases, making comfortable and good bedding for every man 1 left, and fourteen cots for the sick of other regiments; and notwithstanding all this I am rep resented as having sent my sick to the hospital to he laid on the floor with nothing but half a blan ket, folded so that one was under them and the other half over them. On onr return to Holla, after an absence of three days, I at once pitched my hospitaUent. and removed that same evening, all my sick men from the Brigade Hospital to it, leaving all the bedding I rekan to the Brigade Hospital for the use of the sick there, and patting my sick into other and fresh beds, The men of the 18th regiment are all taUs, and Gen. Wyman has the respect and confi dence of every one of them, and If I>. Bu Whitney was to utter such remarks within their bearing as those published in his “Commissioners State ment," he would have an opportunity of showing his fighting or retreating qualities In “double quick," even if the “ladXwho . officiates as hia Adjutant .“could attend 11 -to that business. 1 have never seen such a batekof misrepresenta tions and so little trpth put into the same number of words. . .

SENATOR TRUMBULL’S BILL. FREEDOM to slaves of rebels Speech of Hon. Lyman Trumbull, of Illinois, in the U. S, Sen ate, Thursday, Deo. sth. Mr. Trumbull, (Rep.) of Illinois, intro duced his bill for confiscating the property and giving freedom to the slaves of rebels. He said: In presenting this bill to the consideration of the Senate I desire to accompany it with some remarks explanatory of its character and the principles on which it is based. As its title imports, it is a bill for confiscating the property and giving freedom to the slaves of rebels. * It provides for the absolute and com plete forfeiture forever to the United States of every species of property, real and personal, and wheresoever situated within the United States, belonging to persons beyond the juris diction of the United States, or beyond the reach of civil process in the ordinary mode of judicial proceeding, fin consequence of the present rebellion, who duringits existence shall take up arms against^theTTnitci States, or in any wise aid or abet the rebellion. 

FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY. This forfeiture to be enforced against prop erty in the rebellious districts through the military power, and against property in other portions of the United States in which the iudicial power is not obstructed by the rehel ion, through the courts, and the proceeds of the property of each individgal seized and for feited. subject to the just chums of his loyal creditors, to be held for the benefit of loyal citizens despoiled of their property by the re bellion, and to defray the expenses incurred in its suppression. The bill also forfeits the claims of all rebels and those who give them aid and comfort, to the persons they hold in slaverv, declares the slaves thus forfeited free, and dfekes it the duly of the President to pro vide for the colonization of such of them as may be willing to go, in some tropical coun try, where they may have the protection ot the Government and be secured in all the rights and privileges of freemen. The prop erty belonging to traitors, or those giving them comfort, who may be convicted % the judicial tribunals, is to be forfeited on their conviction, the realty for life and the personal property forever. A 

DISTINCTION MADE. These arc the main features of the bill I have introduced, accompanied with the details necessary to accomplish the objects dictated. It will be observed that a distinction is made ' in the mode of forfeiture of rebel property in districts under insurrectionary control, and that which may be found in districts within the reach of the process of law in its ordinary forms. The forfeiture in the one case to be enforced through military, and in the other through the judicial power. This isamattcrof necessity, for it would be impossible to en force the forfeiture through the courts in dis tricts where the judicial power was overborne by tbe rebellion, and, if not impossible, it would, in my judgment, be clearly unconsti tutional to enforce it any other way in dis tricts where the property seized was within the reach of legal process. So, also, in the case of a conviction lor treason the property of the traitor within reach of the court can only be forfeited by the court—the personalty forever, and the real estate, under the Consti tution, for life only. ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY. The power of Congress to pass a bill of tills character is, to my mind, unquestionable; but I do not place it on the ground which has been advanced in some quarters, that in times of war or rebellion the military is superior to the civil power; or, that in such times what persons may choose to call necessity is higher aud above the Constitution. Necessity is the plesi of tyrants, ami if our Constitution ceases to operate the moment a person charged with its observance thinks there is u necessity to violate it, it is of little value. So fiir from admitting the superiority of the military over the civil power iu time of war, or that there is any necessity that it should be so, I hold that under our Constitution the military is as much subject to the control of the civil power in war as in peace. The powers of Govern ment under our system are three, of which the military is not one. It i» merely incident to the others, and subject to one of these, the Legislative, without whose permission it cuu have no existence, and when called into being ; by the action of Congress, it it by the Consti tution expressly made subject to such rules as Congress shall prescribe for its government. When, therefore, our armies, to raise aud sup port which Congress has express authority under the Constitution, go forth to suppress insurrection, and in doing so shoot down rebels and desolate their abodes, as they con stitutionally may, they are as much subordi nate to the civil'powcr as when engaged in a holiday parade in time of peace; and contra band property seized and appropriated by tbe military in insurrectionary districts in sup pression of the rebellion is as legitimately taken as if condemned to forfeiture by the judicial authorities in districts in which judi cial process was not obstructed. THE CONSTITUTION* AMPLE. I want no other authority for putting down even this gigantic rebellion than such as may be derived’ from the Constitution properly in terpreted. It is equal even to this great emer genev, and the more wc study its provisions, the more it is tried in troublous times, the greater will be our admiration for the instru ment and our veneration for its authors. As unpopular as the avowal may be for the mo ment among the thoughtless, I here declare that lam for suppressing this monstrous re bellion according to law, and in no other way, and I believe that Congress has only to dis charge its duty, aud the army perform its with energy and activity, to brum the war to a speedy and successful issue. We arc fighting to maintain the Constitution, and it especially becomes us, iu appealing to the people to come to its rescue, not to violate it ourselves. Dow are wc better than the rebels if both alike set at nought the Constitution ? I warn my countrymen"who stand ready to tolerate any act done in good faith for the suppression of'the rebellion, not to sanction usurpations of power which may hereafter become prece dents for the destruction of constitutional lib erty. The Constitution declares that Congress shall have power u to declare war,” and “make rules concerning captures on land and water,” “to raise and support armies,” “to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government of the land and naval forces; to provide for calling forth tbe militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions,” and “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry ing into execution the foregoing powers.” WHAT CONGRESS HAS DONE. Acting under those grants of power, Con gress lias provided for bringing into service more than half a million of men, who are now engaged in suppressing the insurrection; and has, to some extent, made rules for the govern ment of these forces, which, as far as they go. are obligator}* on them; but iu the absence of any regulation as to how the army is to be used in suppressing the insurrection, its com mander would be at liberty to make such use of it, consistent with the rules of civilized warfare, as he believed must be conducive to the service of the State, and best calculated to secure the cud for which it was called into being, upon the principle that every man en trusted with an employment or duty is pre sumed to be invested with all tbe power neces sary to enable him to perform the service. Hence the power of the army, in the suppres sion of an insurrection, to seize, imprison or shoot the insurgents; to desolate the country they occupy; to seize aud appropriate for tbe lime being their property, aud free the per sons they uold in bondage, is as ample and complete under the Constitution as that of a court in peaceful times to arrest, imprison, try and execute a murderer. ITS POWERS DEFINED. That the judicial tribunals have no right or power to interfere with the army in the"exer cise of its powers in suppressing an insurrec tion, either by issuing writs of Habeas corpus or otherwise,'is apparent from the tact that the only ground on which the military au thority can be invoked at all is, that the judi cialtribunalbeing overborne are incompetent to the task. The judicial authority ends at the very point where the military begins. It may be, and often is, a delicatcjqucstion to de termine this particular point, and decide in what localities the military, and In what judi cial, authority should have sway. This the Constitution has left to be provided for by Congress, by dcdarinartliat it shall have power to call forth the militia to suppress insurrec tion ; and Congress, soon after the adoption of the Constitution, passed an act authorizing the President to call forth the militia for that gurpose whenever the laws of the United talcs were obstructed by combinations too 1 powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, and by an act passed at the first session of the present Con gress, the President is authorized, in certain cases, to declare the inhabitants of a State, or part thereof, in a state of insurrection, and make use of the army to'euppress it.
