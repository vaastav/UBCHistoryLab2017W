There is no doubt that Dr. Pope, of Newberry, is one of the most influen tial members in the House-, and those who used to twit him as a thrce-for-a quarter statesman are ominously silent on that subject. It is amusing to note the difference now 2nd one year ago, in some of the Atiies, in speaking of the speeches of the economie members. Then it was ft buncombe and the speakers were demagogues ; now the speeches are eloquent,, aod the speakers are earnest, though mistaken reformers. Well, such is life. Senator McMaster seems to be the leader of the anti-reformers. If he will go-up on the sand hills of his County, aod spend just one week among, people who ase really poor, and remember that Half the State is* m the same condition, we think even be- wou??be reformed. Trial Justices- must he naughty folks. The Legislature seems- never to tire pecking at them, reducing their sala ries, reducing their numbers, and; mul tiplying, their miseries. The tradi tional ingratitude- of Republics- never was better exemplified than re the treatment by the State of Trial Justices ?provided they have ever done any thing worthy of gratitude The snow storm last week was a big thing. '. Through the Middle States tbe tali was very heavy, and delayed trains and mails were reported from all points. Even in the upper part of this State tbe roads were blockaded sufficiently to cause delay. S. 3. Cux, our late Minister to Tur key, who was ekcted in November to fill PoIttserV unexpired term in Con gres?, received an uproarous welcome, front: the House when he came in to be sworn.

S&e?rai of 1812 closed 73 years ago, but the applicants- at the pension de partment in the ?st five years- run up to 78,000?so the papers say. . Bilis for a new Court House and Post Office lor Charleston have been present ed in both tbe U. S. Senate and House. As the Treasury is overflowing, and' the officials are sorely puzzled to find some method of spend io g it, we sup pose they ought not to hesitate very lonjf over ^giving this building to -Charleston more especially as she geuu- : inely seeds it. Revenue reformers are'pleased with _the President's message, b?t' they need not build any. hopes on it. This coun try is destined to . stick to protection. The- working men in the No?tb and West have an insane idea that it. bene fits them.; and though the contrary is true, they .will abide their belief, and protection will flourish. The present Congress expires March 3rd, 18'87, and the Fiftieth Congress, which then succeeds is made up as fol lows, according to tbe list by the House Clerk: Democrats 168, Republicans 152, Independents 4, and one vacancy to be filled. Of this number, 195 are members of tbe present Congress, and of these 100 are Democrats and 95 Re publicans. The Democrats will have a very safe majority except when it comes - to a vote on the tariff, and then Randall will take his crowd over to the Repub licans. President Cleveland ought to be abundantly pleased with tbe warm words of commendation with which his message has been received. Tbe mud throwers of course find fault, The con tents and general make-up of the mes sage have nothing whatever to do tf?b the opinions they bad formed, and their [ criticisms could have been written as appropriately last year as now. No one expects Mr. Cleveland te please disap pointed spoils-hunters or rabid Repub licans. Principle and pelf are so iati- , stately associated in such minds that , there is no distinction ; but to the de cent element of the country the mes sage is acceptable. Some folks do so love to growl about taxes. Well, we have a proposition to j make to that class of grumblers who j drink. Every time they come to town during the coming year, let them de posit in the bank, or with some friend, the money which they are accustomed : to spend for liquor; and next Decem ber, when taxes are due let them claim this deposit and see if it will not pay their taxes in full, and buy a Christmas present for their wives. Among all in ' consistencies, the man seen coming out of a saloon wiping his mouth and at the samo time grumbling about taxes, stands pre-eminent. The Augusta Chronicle has cstab- ! ltabed a bureau in Charleston right uo- j der the nose of the JCeies and Courier, and the sweet spirit of peace which r brooded over those two papere, has ! again taken flight, and horrid discord | with brazen tongue is now in tbe as- j cendant. These papers remind us of boys who get mad and fight and thcu make friend*. eiuur??iijg with much ef fu.'iou. until the spirit of perversity tempts one to stick a pin in tbe other, and then they go at it again, biting, gvugiug and kicking for all they a. e worth : A .more coil dish- e-rhibition of temper cam not be imagined than two newspapers engaged in a quarrel. Stop it brothers ; it sours your tempers. "Minnie Davis oughtn't to do so foolish a tbiug as to write an article on the 'Lost Cause* for one of the maga zines.

Yankee women can spout di atribes eg?inst the'Sootn, and laud their heroes to the skies ; but when a South errr woman writes in defence of ber people, she ' 'oughtn't to do so foolish a I thing-" What uomeasurable, unalloy [ ed fools these Yankee editors be ? We hope Miss Minnie will write and hit [ hard. It may make the coming gener ation of Northerners more hambie if j they are convinced of the wonderful ras I cality of most of the men who fought lagaiust the Confederacy. 

JUDGE T. B. FRASEB. j We congratulate the Third Circuit on the re-election of tibia fearless, able and incorruptible Judge. As was said by Senator Rhame in his nominating speech : 'Nothing could be said of him but what was good.* We cannot afford to lay such officials aside. SENATOR MOISE. In the debate last Wednesday, on the Cellege Tuition BUI, Senator Moise's speech advocating- free tuition was re markable for its eloquent and earnest delivery. This was the speech which called' forth the applause from the Col lege boja, and for which breach of de corum they have received several lec tures. ?_ ? LIFE TENURE FOB JUDGES. We can see no good argument in fa vor of the suggested change. The friends of the mo7e lay great stress upon the need of so arranging for the election of judges as to preclude any necessity for electioneering on their part. We can see no need of it under the present arrangements. We would want no bet ter evidence of t&e un fitness of a lawyer for the Judge's seat than an electioneer ing effort on his part. Nor is there any doubt on the part of a Judge's 'friends of-bis re-election, if be deserves it. Tbe people of South Carolins knew what would be the result of the election for Judge of the Third Circuit, be fore the election, as . well as thty did after it, ? and ; so it is with any worthy incumbent. It is only in cases where there is a belief that an improvement can be made and a change desired, that any feeling of uncertainty exists. And .itis just for such cases that the present law is suitable. We suppose that we wilt scarcely shock our readers when we say that a change in one or two of the present' bench might be desirable, but if all the Judges were iu for Hfe;: there would be no pos sible chai!ce for stich a thing"; and, in deed, tHere is-not jnu?h . hope of it.any way, bat_.under tbe present law it is. possible,-and? that gives-us grounds for hope. ?IJR 

LAW-MAKERS. The Legislature has: been, bard at work the past week, and barring too much talk, are making reasonable prog ress. The legislation under way, is a mixture, good, bad and indifferent ap.d the good bills are being slaughtered equally with the bad ones. In the in terest of economy the bill irllowing the foreman of the grand jury to swear wit nesses should have passed, but the con servatism of the Senate killed it. The bill of Mr. Thomas from Union to re duce the salaries of the State oncers, was, we think, very properly defeated. The passage of the bill cutting off the salary of the Lieutenant Governor is to bo vommended. The bill reducing the pay of School Commissioners is of doubt ful policy. If their work is worth any thing at ail, it is worth what is now be* iug paid Tor it. Until the duties of the office are entirely changed^ the pay should not be reduced Combining the offices of Supervisor and Jury Com missioner is another good more, and ought to become a law. The several ??lis intended to reform and improve tri?l Justices ts being arranged into an omnibus . *U for the State, which will come up to due time, doubtless to be j staio along witj; the hundreds of other | dead. The Canal ?:r>m the present) outlook stands but a feeo> chance for I an appropriation, and inde^J. all the j appropriations will be closely scrutinized j by Dr. Pope and his economic brethren We regret that the cigarette bill did not f pass. If parents won't make an effort j to check the vice, the State should step ! in and take a hand. Senator Murray j has in charge a first class prohibition bill for Anderson and Laureas, which ?tands a good chance of becoming a law. Wc imagine we can detect a little dif ferencc growing between the two houses not larger than "a man's hand*' at pre- j sent but with a chance of fu'il develop- ! ment later on.

The Work that has Been Accomplished. SUMTER IN DANGER OF BEING LEFT OUT OF THE LINE AND GIVEN THE GO-BY. S. P." in Ote Manufacturers' Record.} Johnson City, Tenn., November 20. Early last summer I wrote you from Ashev?lle an autbentic statement of the plans, as far as "matured, of tbe Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad Company. I arriFed here this morning to commence a journey across tbe territory that road will traverse from this point to the Ohio River. The need of an air line railroad of low grade between Charleston, on the Atlantic, and the Ohio River, has long been apparent to business men.. The construction of such a road would have been attempted fifty years ago if the money could bave been secured to pay its cost. Capitalists could not see any possi oil i ty of dividends from the hasiness such a road would do, aud gave, a decided negative to all who sought their assistance. ! The discovery of tbe vast wealth awaiting development in. the mountains of Eastern Kentucky and Western Virginia bas given a new direction to.capital, and made tbe con struction of such a road a certainty. Ashland, on the Ohio River, is in the heart of the famous Harrying Rock region, where are more than fifty blast iron furnaces. Some years ago tbe Chaiteroi Railroad was built from Ashland down the valley to the Big Sandy River for fifty-one miles into the 'unlimited splint coal fields. Ten miles south there are vast deposits of cannel ccal, extend ing to the Virginia line. In the same district are inexbautible veins of rich specular and hematite ores. The Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Company has purchased the Chatteroi Road and incorporated it into its system. It is now extending that road into the region above referred to, and will, by the first of March, have twenty miles finished and in operation, thus carrying these coals and ores to the Banging Rock furnaces, and to Cincinnati and other Northern markets. At the other end of its line it has completed .the stretch between Black's Station, on the Charlotte and Atlanta Air Line Road, and Shelby, and is laying the rails petween that place and Rutherford ton. Work will b? push ed with all possible rapidity on the southern end of tbe road from Black'? Station, via York ville, Rock Hill and Lancaster to Cam den, Sooth Carolina, the county seat of Ker shW, where connection will be made with tbe old South Carolina Railroad and by it with Charleston. ' ? Johnson City is a thriving town, incorpo rated by the Legislature in March, 1885. It has now a population of 2,500, and is the seat of considerable trade. The East Ten nessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad passes through it, and. tbe narrow guage Cranberry Road terminates here. The town lias a num ber, of common schools, seven churches, a large tannery, using annually about $250, 000 in its business; the-most complete, modern built and fitted foundry and machine shop in the South, and several small industries. Thereafe two weekly papersj the Comet und. the Enterprise, which contribute much to the life and enterprise of the borough. Present hotel accommodations are not up to the standard of tbe town in other respects, but there will scon be a change for the better in this respect. The citizens are hoping that the "three CV railroad will pass through here, but that mat ter has not been decided definitely by the company. Whether such be'the case or not, that railroad will give this people cheap coal and enable them to manufacture Cranberry iron into many forms of hardware. THE. 

LEGISLATURE. MONDAY, DEC. 6. UO?SE. There was no meeling of the Senate to-day, that body having adjourned over till Tuesday. Th? house met at 12 MM And proceeded to work io a perfunctory manner. As there was a large lisi of absentees, most of the more important bills were postponed. But few new bills were introduced. Tbe bill to pro vide for the more speedj* and efficacious pay ment of-the per diem and mileage of jurors and witnesses, with a number of others of merely local Importance, was read a third time and sent to the Senate. A number of important bills passed to the third reading aud the House adjourned at 3 P. M. TUESDAY, DEC. 7. SSNATK. The Senate met at 7 P. M., and went to work as if in earnest. A concurrent resolu tion appointing Wednesday, IP. M.as the time for electing a Judge of the 3rd Circuit was passed. Among the uew bids, was one authorizing Probate Judges to perform the duties of Registration. The bill to provide for the transportation of prisoners by Peni tentiary guards passed the second reading, also the bills to authorize the foreman of the grand jury to swear witness', and to reduce tke salaryjof the Lieut. Governor. The latter provoked some sharp discussion.. HOUSR. The House met at 10 A. M. The bill to fix the salary and compensation of School Com missioners provoked considerable discussiou. It fixes the salary at $200 and allows SlOO for mileage, and was passed to the 3rd read ing. The bill to repeal the lien law came up as a special order ai-1 o'clock. After some warm speeches, the bill was snowed under by a heavy majority. The next special order, being a joint reso lution proposing a constitutional amendment regarding the tenure of office of Judges, was jouiinued io the;session of 18S7\ WEDNESDAY, DEC. S, SSNATSi The Tuitiou-f-e bili was the important mat ter before the Senate to-day. The bill is .Sen ator Edwards, and instructs trustees to charge a tuition tee of $G0.0b f?>r all students abie to pay that ainonnt. and carne ? as a Special order. Senator .McMaster oj?rctd the light j against tiie bill. Senator Sligh followed on the other side. Speeches favoring free tuition were also made by Senators Woodward, Aloise and R?tame, and in opposition by Sen ators Murray and Patterson, Senator Kd- j wards had i he floor on the same side when an j adjournment was m oie to the 11 ili of the ' House where the j >m; assembly proceeded to ; electa Jud?e o? lite 3rd Circuit. Senator ? Rhume of Clarendon nominated Judge T. Vi. i Fntser for rt-elrcl'?o.n, Maj. Wilson of Sumter Seconded the nomination. No o:hcr name w?> propo-ed and he received U5 votes out O? the 1-53 cast. The Senate then returned to ils j chamber. The bill requiring the Governor to appoint j one and the saint- person lor Auditor ajid . Treasurer received an unfavorable report. ? Bills were introduced to amend the priority ! lien law : to ameud the Constitution in reter- ; encelo Homestead ; to regulate the sale of i seed cotton; aud to provide a more e?icient \ system of working public roads. house.

The canal committee submitted majority and minority reporis. The former report gives the following figures : total cost of canal to date $129,724.28, of which the State has coDtributod in labor $75,093.07, and in money $46,908.61, the city of Columbia fur nishing the balance. It is estimated that its completion will cost $1 9,62&90 more, of which-S42y4O6^0^.wiU be cash, .^?o .recom mendation accompanies the report. Accord ing to the minority report, the cost of the canal thus far has been $201,956.67. The re port recommends that the work stop where it now is, or that it be turned over to tho Peni tentiary to be utiliized by that institution ip furnishing the necessary water power fot the city water works. Action on the reports was postponed till Saturday. The discussion on the College tuition bill was resumed and was participated in by a number of Senators ?.Messrs. Edwards, Sroythe, Sligh andHetnp hill b?iug prominent. It finally passed the second reading, with some amendments and with notice of still further amendments on i's final reading, But little progress was made on the ctlendar : cause?cacotehes loquzndi. house. The new bills were unimportant except one to pay jurors and witnesses at inquests. Tbe consideration of the reports on the canal was made the special order for Saturday. Tbe bill relating to Sunday trains, and al lowing them to run during certain mouths for the convneience of truck farmers was length ily discussed and finally passed. The Senate bill relating to the re-assessment of the real ty of the Earthquake District came up, and a motion to strike out the enacting clause was warmly discussed. The speeches took a wide range and pending the discussion tbe House with the Senate went into an election for Superintendent for tbe Penitentiary. Col, Lipscomb was re-elected by the flattering vote of 96 to 69. Messrs. S. W. Broker, C. W. McFadden, and J P. Guinguard were elected Directors. FRIDAY, DEC. 10. senate. Senator Murray's bill, submitting to the voters of Anderson tbe question of license or no license won an easy and decided victory. It passed the third reading and goes to the House. If any prohibitory legislation can be made a success by statutory enactment, tbe Anderson bill will certainly score one, and the liquor men are in sore distress over its iron clad complexion. The consideration of the constitutional amendment to make a life ten ure for Judges, was postponed till next ses sion. Tbe bills ratifying t be census and bond amendments, adopted: at the last election were passed, in one case unanimously and in the other with but one dissenting vote. Among tbe new bills was one amending the Constitu tion so that the State Superintendent of Edu cation shall be elected by !he Legislature for a term of four years, and another ratifying the consolidation of the C. C. & 0. Road with the various roads along its line oi route, as adopted- at the late meeting of the Directors in Charleston. At 2.30 tributes to Senator Bobo of Spartanburg and Todd of Laurens were delivered, and the Senate adjourned out of respect to their memory. house. The House resumed the discussion of the Earthquake assessment bill, and Mr. Brawley made a most eloquent plea for Charleston. The motion to strike out the. enacting clause had been withdrawn, and the question now pending was a"motion to strike out section 4. which provides for a rebate of taxes on dam aged or destroyed property proportioned to the damages sustained. Messrs. Moses, Sbaw and Wilson, each favored striking out that section, not because they were unwilling to help Charleston but because the rest of the Slate was equally embarrassed in financial matters. The section was finally stricken out by a vote of 62 to '56. much to the dis gust, apparently, of the News and Courier correspondent who publishes the entire vote by Counties. Sumter w*s solid against the section. Thus amended the bill passed lo a third reading. SATURDAY,-DEC. 11. senate. The Senate refused to concur in the House amendment to the earthquake bill. Tbe House bill authorizing the foreman of the grand jury to swear witnesses was defeated by a vote of 25 to 4. The bill to pay Attor ney-General Miles $1,000 for extra services in the Bond cases before the U. S. Courts was passed by asiim minority. Senator Murray's bill amending the section fixiog the trustees of tbe S. C. College, provoked a hot discus sion, but finally passed so amended as to al low the Sopreme Court Judges to remain on the Board. The Canal bill was discussed and final consideration postponed until Monday. The bill to abolish the office of Jury Commis sioner was killed, us were also the bills to fix the compensation of Supervisors of Registra tion and to prohibit the sale of cigarettes to persons under 15. The bill to amend the law relating to County and School Commis sioners passed the 2nd-reading. Tbe Senate adjourned after a day's hard work, h0cse. A resolution fixing fifteen minutes as the maximum time for speeches, was adopted. The concurrent resolution appropriating $1,000 for the pnrpose and authorizing the Commissioner of Agriculture of this State to make an exhibit of the State's resources a; ? the Inter-State Grange Encampment at Spar tanburg, S. C, was adopted and ordered sent to the Senate. A large number of unimportant bills passed their second reading. The bill to repeal the original lien law was postponed to the next session The bill to fix the manner of pub lishing the reports of County officers created a lively debate. The House adjourned pend ing the discussion. Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup never fails to cure a cough or cold in a short time. Give it a fair trial. Mr. J.

For twelve or fourteen years I have been a great sufferer from a terrible form of blood poison wh;^h ran into the secondary, and finally it was ; . onounced a tertiary form. My head, face and shoulders became almost a mass of corruption, and finally the disease commenced eating away my skull hones. I became so horribly repulsive that for three years I absolutely refuged to let people sre me. I used large quantities of most noted blood remedies and applied to nearly all physicians near me, but my condition continued Jogrow worse, and all snid that I must surely die. My bonos became the seat of excruciating aches and pains; my nights were passed in misery ; I was reduced in flesh and strength ; my kidneys were terribly deranged, and life became a burden to rue. I chanced to see an advertisement of B. B. B. and sent one dollar to W. C Birch more ! & Co , merchants of our place, and they pro cured one honie for me.
