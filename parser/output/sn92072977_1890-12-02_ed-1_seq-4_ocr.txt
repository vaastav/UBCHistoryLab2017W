C, Dec. 1. Senate. There was an unusually large attend ance of Senators present at the opening of to-day's session. The seats on both sides of the chamber were nearly all occupied, and the galleries were filled with spectators. The most conspicuous object in the chamber was a large bed of roses surmounted by a dome-like pedestal, on which strutted in the flush and pride of victory, a rooster, emblem atic of the Democratic success in the re cent elections . This decorated the desk of Mr. Voorhees. Immediately after the Chaplain's prayer the credentials of the two hena-tors-elect frcm the new State of Wyom- - 1 1 IT- nn rA mg were presenieu uy mi. uuai, when they were read, the two Senators, Messrs. Carey and Warren, were escort ed to the vice-President's desk ank took A drawinar bv lot to decide their re spective terms took place, the shorter term closing March, 1893, falling to Mr. Warrej, ami the loager one, closing March, 1S95, to Mr. Carey. A recess was then taken until 1:30 to await the coming of the President's Message. After the recess a report was made house on Monday at 3 o'clock. Yester day at that hour a goodly number of people had assembled at the court house to see what was to come off. Mr. Jno. W. Thompson had just been inducted into the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court and was busily en gaged in receiving the office, with vari ous instructions, from his predecessor. But a crowd riled into his office and presently Mr. N. B. Broughton called Mr. Thompson to "stand up." That gentleman arose and Mr. Broughton said: Mr. Thompson, I am called on to perform a very pleasant duty for myself and some of vour friends. You have had two severe frights recently. One was when you wanted the nomination for Superior court clerk ana learea you would not get it. Then you had a pretty bad fright because you were afraid you would n t get elected: for you were run ning against a man who was accustomed to win tremendous victories. JNow, we intend to fix you so you can have some show in case you have any more frights. Here is a handsome cane which 1 am requested to present to you by your friend, Prof. McK. Goodwin, who was your competitor for the Democratic nomination. This cane was cut from the battlefield of Waterloo in 1889, by Prof.

The caucus was in session for nearly two hours. There was a large attendance and no dissent from the proposition to carry out the programme agreed upon before the adjournment of the first session to take up the Foderal election bill at the beginning of this ses sion and press it to a vote. The Committee on Order of Business was directed to prepare an order of busi ness, the first measure to be considered to be the Federal election bill. The committee appointed at the last session to co-operate with the Republi- . can members of the Committee on Rules in the preparation of a rule to provide for calling the previous question, was instructed to report some modification of existing ruhs with this object in view, and it was agreed that if the Dem ocrats use obstructive tactics against the Federal election bill, a propostion to change the rules will be brought in im mediately. The caucus was harmonious through out. The action of the caucus does not de termine the question of passing the Federal election bill.

There was a good attendance on both sides of the hall aud much good natured badinage about the recent election Hew across the centre aisle. On the desk of the Speaker was a pyramid of flowers, and there were other floral pieces on the desks of Representatives Kerr, of Penn sylvania, Holman, Harmer, Flick, Wil son, of West Virginia, Atkinson, of West Virginia, Vaux and Flower. One minute before noon the Speaker entered the hall and ascended the steps to the Speaker's chair. The tap of his gavel brought the House to order as the hands of the clock marked noon. Chaplain Milburu delivered a brief prayer, and then the clerk began to call the roll by States. The roll-call dis closed the presence of 227 members, and the clerk was directed to inform the Senate that a quorum of the House had appeared and that that body was ready to proceed to business. On motion of Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, a resolution was adopted for the ap pointment of a committee to join a similar committea on the part of the Senate to wait on the President. Mr. Rogers, of Kaa3as, rising to a question of the highest privilege, asked that the oath of office be administered himself in the able discharge of his duties." Mr. Thompson was completely taken by surprise and showed it in his fea tures and deportment. It was really some moments before he could "get his bearings," so to speak. He looked at the cane in a dazed sort of way for a lit tle while, then be earnestly remarked his appreciation, which he said he could not express as he felt it. He referred to the campaign, and eaid that during its progress the most kindly relations had obtaiued between himself and Mr. Upchurch, and all he hoped for was to make as able and efficient and popular officer as Mr. Cnas. D. Upchurch had made. He felt special appreciation for the very graceful action on the part of Prof. Goodwin. After the incident some one suggested that hereafter Mr. Thompson should be known as "Jno. Wellington Thompson
