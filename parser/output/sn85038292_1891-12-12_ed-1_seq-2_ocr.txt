(Thr Ihinacratif Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATUKDAV, DECEMBER 12,1801. The Speakership. In an article on the Speakership, in the issue of November 7th, the ADVOCATE said—“ Some months ago the Advocate expressed a preference for Mr. Crisp, and. all things considered, he is, in our judg ment, the best equipped of all the aspirants. The Advocate then went on to advocate the selection of Mr. Springer, of Illinois. He is a good parliamentarian, has had long experience in the House, is a tariff reformer, sound on finance, and comes from a state that has recently sent a Democrat to the United States Senate and increased its Democratic representation in the House from seven to fourteen. Illinois, it must be remembered, was once reliably Repub lican by from forty to fifty thousand, and it is the centre of a belt of states, from the Ohio River to the Dakotas, where the great tight in 18112 is to be waged. To have given Illinois the Speakership would have been a recognition, we thought, of the sturdy Democracy of that commonwealth, and also an encouragement to the Democ racy of the northern half of the Union which hits, for the first time since the war, elected a majority of Democrats to Con gress. Further, Mr. Springer’s election, we believed, would have avoided the sec tional issue raised against the Democrats in 1888, when it was truthfully charged that the Speaker and all the important committee chairmen were from the South. We yield to the party’s selection, how ever, and it may be better that Mr. Crisp has been chosen. Mr. Springer himself withdrew and voted for him. Had the Speakership gone North, the other positions would probably have been distributed in the South As it is, the South secured the Speaker and the other positions are all given to the North. James Kerr, of Pennsylvania, was made Clerk' Samuel S. Voder, of Ohio, Sergeant-at-Arms; Charles 11. Turner, of New \ork. Door keeper; and Lyeurgus Dalton, of Indiana. Postmaster. By this distribution the Democracy of New York, Pennsylvania Ohio and Indiana arc complimented, and Illinois will doubtless get a prominent committee chairmanship by the appoint ment of Mr. Springer. Mr. Crisp is the best equipped man for Chairman, by reason of his thorough knowledge of the rules and his equitable temjKTainent. Mr. Mills is too irascible for the position, and Mr. Springer s chief claim to the place, although very competent, was his geographical location from a party standpoint. There was no party policy involved in the contest nor were tlure any presiden tial aspirations bound up in it. Republican papers affected to believe that the failure to elect Mr. Mills would be a virtual aban donment of the tariff issue, but this was only a part in politics they were playing. They sougl t thus to drive Democrats into selecting him, and counted upon his excit able disposition to lead him into errors that would offset Reed’s rude and autocratic conduct. Tariff reform is still the leading issue, with sound finance next, and Cleveland is still the leading candidate for the Demo cratic presidential nomination. This would have been the situation had any of the aspirants been chosen, for party policy on the tariff and finance was not involved in the result, neither were the fortunes of Mr. Cleveland. Testing the McKinley Act. Three cases, involving the constitution ally of the McKinley tariff act, were argued before the Supreme Court of the United States last week. The cases were those of Boyd, Sutton A Co. and Sternbach Sc Co., of New York, and Marshall, Field & Co., of Chicago, against the collectors of cus toms at New York and Chicago respect ively. The eases involved three points and were heard together by a full bench. The points raised were that the sugar bounty clause of the McKinley act is unconstitutional, and that this fact invali dates the whole act; that the reciprocity clause is a delegation of the taxing power to the President, therefore in violation of the constitution, and this vitiates the whole act; that the law is unconstitutional because the tobacco rebate clause was omitted from the hill signed by the Pres ident. There is still another ease before the court attacking the constitutionality of the act, because the bill was acted upon by less than a quorum necessary to do business, Speaker Reed having no authority to count as present and taking part in the proceed ings of the House those who declined to vote. The Governor of Virginia sent a special message to the Legislature on Wednesday in reference to the oyster interests of that state. About the same condition of things exists there as here in Maryland. The oyster beds have been depleted and the production has fallen off one-half in the last ten years. The Governor recommends a survey and platting of the grounds and a rental for a period of ten years to the highest bidder, also a culling law, except ing all oysters under 21 inches, the pro tection of planters and no oystering per mitted, under severe penalties, between sunset and sunrise. A revenue of 85,- 000,000 per annum, he thinks, may be realized by the state. The interests of tongers, dredgers and planters antagonize each other, and the “oyster war” is likely to rage as fiercely there as it does here. The cupidity of the oystermen is certain to destroy the oysters, and any legislation to prevent it is certain to meet with their de termined opposition. Two political sensations occurred in New York this week. One was the announce ment by William J. O’Dair. who was elected to the Legislature by a combination of Republicans, County Democrats and Peo pie’s Municipal that he would sup port Democratic measures in the Assembly, thus adding to the Democratic majority in that body. The # other was the announce ment that John Y. MeKane, who left the Democratic party in 1888 and carried fifteen hundred voters with him, and materially aided in carrying the state for Harrison, had returned to the Democratic fold. Tho President’s Message. President Harrison submitted his third annual message to Congress on Wednes day- It is voluminous and essentially a business message, giving a resume of for eign and domestic affairs, and containing but few recommendations. Parts of it are intended for political effect —those refer e ing to the persecution of the Hebrews in s Russia and the elevation of the Agricul ■: tural to an equality with other departments. , The one is meant to catch the Hebrew - vote, and the other to impress the farmer with the distinguished consideration the * Republican party has for him. The note • of this government expressing “deep con c cent” on a question of’ a purely domestic • affair in Russia, was a piece of impertinent J interference, and the change at the Agri - cultural department is one in name only, i so far as the lienefits to agriculture arc con * eerned. The title of Commissioner has - been changed to Secretary, the salary of ■ the office increased, and the Secretary has I a scat at the farther end of the Cabinet ‘ table. ■ The message makes plain one fact—that ‘ is, our foreign affairs have been badly J managed, and our jioliey has been an ag- J gressive one of interference and intermed - dling with the domestic concerns of other ■ governments and of extravagant and un -1 tenable claims upon our part. ’ By claiming that which our country ' protested against when made by Russia, 3 concerning jurisdiction in Bering sea, the ■ Harrison Administration brought thiscoun s try dangerously near an open rupture with I Kngland. Bluster did not deter Lard t Salisbury, and Mr. Blaine had to recede • and consent to arbitration. President 11 ar ■ rlson devotes some attention to the Bering P sea controversy, but he handles the subject f carefully and omits important facts in the l! case. 8 Then there Is the controversy with Italy, II over the New Orleans lynching, the hasty action of our officials encouraging the Ital- M ian government to make claims that this '* government had to deny; the Data affair— *l our own courts deciding that the vessel’s S detention was unlawful and consequently, r * also, the subsequent chase and surrender; the meddling with Chilian affairs by our 10 incompetent and indiscreet minister; the h attack upon our sailors, the outcome of d hostility engendered by the imprudence of lt Minister Egan; the insolent protest against 1 ■ expulsion decrees by the Russian govern ment; the interference of this government r in a question of boundary between Gaule h mala and the British government. All these arc spoken of by President L * Harrison, and he presents the facts in the light most favorable to bis Administration, b More controversies with foregn nations >' have sprung up under the present Admin istration than for some years past, and this 11 fact is sufficient evidence of the lack of ■ prudence and diplomatic ability on the ri part of this government. Our own course u is responsible for all of these international * disputes. s Upon the leading questions of the day— • tariff and finance—the President is brief. * He recommends that there be no legisla * tion upon either. The country, he says, 1 is enjoying larger prosperity than ever 3 before, under the McKinley bill, and quotes statistics to show that for the year ? ended September 30th, 1801, our exports | s were some $02,000,000 greater than in the 1 • previous year, and of this increase about | 1 S 15,000,000 were in agricultural products. | Whatever increase there has been in our 1 agricultural exports is due to abundant | 1 crops at home and short crops abroad. The ; McKinley act is praised for the alleged great prosperity of the country, the Presi dent forgetting that in his Thanksgiving ! proclamation he said it was (oo great to be . the work of man and ascribed it to an All- I j wise God. And in his message the recip- j \ rocal trade relations negotiated with Spain f and several other countries are spoken of with evident satisfaction, as contributing to our prosperity, the President again for getting that reciprocity is free trade, not ! I protect inn . The latter portion of the message is de , I voted to the subject of elections, and the r President laments the failure of the Force s bill in the last Congress. He says the j. chief national danger lies in the suppression y or perversion of the popular suffrage, and r this in the face of the well-known fact that ! f he now holds the high office of President B through purchased votes in “blocks of five,” 1 by a corruption fund raised by a Philadel -8 phia merchant, who holds a cabinet position as a reward for his part of the work. Seeing that an overwhelming Democratic c House and an increased Democratic vote c in the Senate is an effectual bar to Force is bills during this Congress, tho President s says it would be possible to constitute a it Hou-jHirttMun commission to consider the [, evils of our election system and methods, 0 with a view to correcting or removing them, and suggests that the constitution would permit the selection of the commis siou to be vested in the Supreme Court. y Democrats remember too well the Bx7 1 commission of 1877, which suppressed the 8 popular and electoral verdict and defrauded e Tilden out of the Presidency, to place con c fidcnce in the non-partisan character of 2 the Supreme Court. They are no more to s be trusted than other people—imbued * with no more fairness and impartiality. 2 The 'message is devoid of anything of ' statesmanship, neither is it framed in clear, ■ forcible and expressive language. In ex ' pression it is common place. It is com -1 prehensive, however, and business-like, and ’ for the grandson of his grandfather is very 2 good. ; On the matter of the civil service, Presi dent Harrison, in his message, says “the . law is being executed with impartiality.” i This is a bold assertion, when it is remem- bered that he delayed the putting of the railway mail service under the civil service law, in order to provide places for political workers who were incompetent to pass the r examination, and that dismissals were made - after the law applied to the service and the I discharges dated back to evade it. It will f be remembered, too, that the civil service | law was openly violated by Federal officials ■ ' in Baltimore, and the fact was duly inves , | tigated by Civil Service Commissioner i | Roosevelt, who reported to the President -! and recommended the dismissal of certain ) j offenders. The result was that the offend i era, all loud Harrison supporters, continue r j in their snug berths, and Mr. Roosevelt . came dangerously near b, ing invited to I step down and out. A Ridiculous Performance. The Baltimore Sun a few weeks ago at tempted to be facetious in au article on the rural press, but succeeded only in being insolent, and its vanity cropped out boldly when it alluded to itself as the “leader” and “teacher” and “guide,” of said press. There is not a Democratic county paper in the state that is not more consistent, fair and logical, for the Svn has none of these qualities. Dls purse-proud and arrogant, wavering and uncertain. On Monday it indulged in a double leaded editorial on the Speakership. When articles are thus printed it is done to give them special prominence, and they are supposed to bo duly weighed and consider ed before publication. Here is an extract from it: “If those Democrats who are personally hostile to Mr. Cleveland and would prefer the nomination of some other candidate for the presidency—or, if any person who himself cherishes aspirations for the next Democratic nomination —are seeking to influence the election of Speaker for that purpose, they have chosen an occasion for the promotion of their private and personal aims and ambi tions most unfortunate for themselves and for the party. If those Democrats who would like to seo free silver substituted as au issue for tariff reform in 1802 imagine that they can bring that result to pass by excluding from the Speaker’s chair the Democrat whose name is more conspicuously identified with the cause of tariff reform before the entire country than that of any oilier member of the House, we can’t help thinking that that also is a grave mistake in point of time and method. The selection of a candidate for Speaker should be kept clear from all such unnecessary and dangerous complications. It is Mr. Crisp’s misfortune, wholly unde served it may be on his part, that his candi dacy should have received such active sup port, outside of the House, from men who make no secret of their opposition to Mr. Cleveland and of their preference for free silver over tariff reform as a party issue in the next election.” It is thus intended to show that Mr. Cleveland’s fortunes were bound up in the result, and that the failure to elect Mr. Mills, “whose name is more conspicuously identified with the cause of tariff’ reform than any other member of the House, would be a set back for tariff reform. Mr. Crisp’s election, it is intended to show, would be in antagonism to Mr. Cleveland, Ac., &c. The article was endeavored to in fluence the Democrats of the House, and the argument, or rather mere statements and insinuations, it was supposed, would cause a general rush to act on its views. Mr. Crisp was chosen, however, and here is another instance of the Sun s impotency in Democratic counsels. Not only was Crisp not defeated, but bis vote was in creased by twenty-five, enough to elect and more, and the two Democratic Con gressmen from Baltimore even had the temerity to vote for him from the begin ning to the end of the balloting. The Sun stood almost alone in giving to the contest its presidential aspect and its tariff and silver bearing, though on Tuesday, after Mr. Crisp’s selection in the Democratic caucus, it undertook to throw the respon sibility upon others, and declared his election had no party policy significance, or that it was very slight. Here is an extract from its Tuesday article: “The significance of Mr. Crisp’s success, from the point of view of paity policy, is prob ably slight, though in the heat of the conflict just closed the attempt was naturally made to give it great importance. It was said by some of Mr. Crisp’s opponents, in the ardor of the struggle, that he was an anti-Cleveland and anti tariff-reform man. This was warmly denied by many of Mr. Crisp’s friends. It is certain that he was supported for the speaker ship by a number of out-and-out tariff-re formers on the ground of personal liking merely, or because he was thought to be bet | ter fitted by temperament for the quasi judi -1 ciul functions of presiding officer of the House. The vote of 111) to 105, by which Mr. Crisp defeated Mr. Mills, shows but a narrow margin of preference for the Georgian lover the Texan, even if the division were i altogether upon radical differences of opinion. It would therefore be absurd to try Iqjmport into the result important political meanings which from the nature of the case it cannot I contain. Mr. Mills has been the more prom inently associated in the public mind with the 1 issue of the day, but Mr. Crisp is also an out spoken advocate of lower taxes. This was i shown unmistakably in his speech last night after being nominated, in which he declared I to his fellow Democrats of the House that he •would take no step backward in the cause of tariff’ reform.’ ” Proof vs. Assertion. The Baltimore Herald , the best paper for its price published, claims a large cir culation, though it is not continually mak ing extravagant claims on that point. The American . a few weeks ago, published some wild assertions about itself, which every newspaper man smiled at, and the Herald at once challenged them to a com parison of circulation, offering to give the American the selection of two of a commit tee of three to inquire into the facts. The Sun has recently indulged iu some talk of papers of limited circulation, and straight way the Herald challenged the Sun to a comparison of city circulation. The Herald offered to prove through a committee of three, two to be of the Sun's staff", that the Herald's circulation equals the Suns in eleven wards, exceeds it in eleven wards, and that the street sales are four times as large as the Sun's. The Sun failed to accept. It is so much easier to assert than to prove, and the Sun prefers assertion to proof. While on this matter of circulation it has always seemed singular that adver tisers do not ascertain what they are buy ing when taking space in a journal. It is rare that they ask the circulation of a paper, and when they do it is rarer still they ascertain the locality of it—whether it is spread over the universe or is concen trated mostly in the territory desired to be reached. They usually pay the price asked and trust to luck. They buy noth ing else unless they know r what they are to get, but when it comes to space in a newspaper they go it blind, and many thou sands of dollars are wasted annually in advertising bills. Governor Russell on the Democratic Outlook. Governor Russell of Massachusetts con tributes to the December number of The Forum an explanation of the recent growth of the Democratic party in Massachusetts, which, he maintains, is attributable to the attitude of the party on the tariff and on silver coinage. The Massachusetts Demo crats have demanded a reduction in duties on raw materials and have opposed the free coinage of silver. Governor Russell does not say that Massachusetts is yet a surely Democratic state, but he docs say that if the national Democratic platform next year endorses the position of the Massachusetts Democrats on these two important points, he thinks the state can be carried by his party. He quotes the last Massachusetts Democratic platform on both these subjects and explains how in all the recent state campaigns Democratic workers have laid their main emphasis on these points. Winter Cheer. Winter is here, and winter is the time i for good cheer and home and fireside com r forts. A few articles of prime necessity is r all that is needed to carry us comfortably ! through the winter. Man wants but little here below. Nor wants that little long. r Only about four-score or five-score years, j Marylanders arc proverbial for well-filled barns, garners, and larders. Maryland is the cornucopia of Plenty. Her barns i are full to overflowing and her presses t burst out with new wine. The voluptuous . epicures, and those who roll in wealth, want many things to minister to their | pampered tastes. But we speak ol the L masses, not the money-bags. Well, let us recount how little it takes for human com fort, after all. ()nc can get through the . winter very pleasantly, with something like ; the following necessary articles : —A barrel . or two of white roller flour, some prime • buckwheat, white corn meal for slapjacks, • a supply of nice sugar-cured hams, a large Orange county cheese, a quantity of linked | sage-seasoned sausage, slightly smoked. • | with hominy to match, sundry fat turkeys, ’ j with oyster trimmings, roast, stewed or ’ ! fried, cranberry sauce and celery, fat capons, I ducks and geese. And we may be pardoned . * for the mention, just here, of just one arti i clc of luxury, which will set the mouths of | all our readers to watering, we know, and j that is —saitr hr nut. Then comes mince. ! apple, and pumpkin pie, plum pudding, i floating island, whipsyllabub, custard, gela -1 tine with wine sauce, cream puffs. iced | cake, bonbons, almonds, walnuts, pecan and J i butternuts, filberts, shellbarks. raisins. grapes, oranges, bananas, cheese, coffee and . j tea. With these few articles of prime • j necessity most persons could get along . I comfortably through the winter, though it ; I should revel in all its usual concomitants of i | snow, ice and sleet. ! O winter, ‘Tuler of the inverted year.’ What need we care, since in thy train • 1 Of snow and sleet and hall and rain, Thou bringest us such bounteous cheer. Fifty-Second Congress. 1 The Fifty-second Congress convened on s Monday. The House was not ready to 1 organize, and both houses held but short . sessions. On Tuesday the House officers D were chosen and full organization effected. v The usual joint committee to inform the s President that Congress was ready to j - receive any communications he might r have to present, and on Wednesday he | - presented his annual message. After its j l* reception the House adjourned until today, j - The Senate held a brief session on Tina’s-1 / day. Among the bills presented was one t for free gold and silver coinage by Mr. 1 Stewart, Republican, of Nevada; by Mr. r Cullom, Republican, of Illinois, to suspend c the coming of Chinese laborers and for - one cent postage, by Mr. Pasco, Dcmo s crat, of Florida, to punish officers forsum , moning jurors with reference to their re i ligious or political affiliations. The free coinage bill was laid on the table, and may , be called up at any time. • j Another revolution is in progress iu y j Rrazil. Fonseca was forced to resign, and j his successor has a big row on his hands. Y j A severe battle has already taken place. s To add f urther to Brazil’s troubles, France has demanded reparation for the killing of ? twelve Frenchman during the scenes of disorder growing out of the action *>f • Fonseca dissolving the Brazillian Congress. i ' i Senator Gorman has been chosen chair '* man of the Senate Democratic caucus. Ho will again lead the Democrats in that • body, and his sound judgment will doubt less be availed of also by the H ouse Dcmo ; crats. [ The election of Crisp for Speaker is very 1 disappointing to the Republicans. They wanted Mills chosen. Disastrous Storms. On December 4 a series of storms passed over a portion of this country, carrying great r destruction with it. A violent wind storm, accompanied by lor rents of rain, swept through the Cumberland Valley, in Pennsylvania, doing great damage e to property. At Shippensburg the round i house of the Western Maryland Railroad, the Cumberland Valley Railroad warehouse and i other properly was demolished. A freight e car was blown from the track at Kerrsvilte, and at Carlisle a number of buildings were - either wholly or partially wrecked. The dam e age at Mechanicsburg v.l~ much more severe, the Methodist church, Franklin Hall and ■ National Hotel being among the properties L . destroyed. Several persons were injured, but there was no loss of life. At Williamsport I the storm was very violent. Many roofs were - damaged, electric lighting disarranged and several small bridges were washed from their A foundations. / At Roanoke, Virginia, a building in course i of construction was blown down. L. B. Her ringe was killed and a man named Lovelace li was very seriously injured, j All the electric light poles on the east side of First avenue, between Twenty-fourth and 5 Fortieth streets, in New York city, were blown s down. At Belvidere, N. J., it was reported to be the • severest of the season, but no serious damage i was done. Much damage was done along the Hudson river to shipping, t The greatest snow blizzard for many years in North Dakota ended on Saturday morning, after having raged 48 hours. The therraome. - ter was all the time below zero. The blizzard in the Northwest on Frida}' M crippled every railway line. At Northfield, n Minnesota, the temperature fell 40 degrees | within one hour, and the wind's velocity was 40 miles an hour. At Chicago the highest r velocity was 54 miles an hour. Buildings were unroofed and other damage was done at Tipton, lowa, on Friday, by a 0 terrific rain and wind storm. e A heavy storm prevailed on Monday over the entire Northwest, from British Columbia to the California line, and east to Montana. 3 In the Cascade Mountains a heavy fall of snow | is reported, and trains were delayed, both on II ; account of snow and falling timber. Tele - graphic wires suffered the most damage. i Great damage on Puget Sound is reported 1 j as the result of a storm on Monday. Several i washouts were encountered on the Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, and trains were de j layed. The Greatest Known Professor Horace Briggs, the well-known 1 e educator, of Buffalo, N. V., has arrived from Japan. He was in Yokohama at the lime of I 1 the great earthquake, and immediately pro . ? ceeded to Nogoya and Gifu, where the shocks i were most severe. After describing the scenes j 5 which have already been published, Professor 3 Briggs said: “In the ruin of the postoflice at Nogoya, ! which was the only brick building in town, ! s twenty postal clerks were buried. The men j e were assorting the morning mail when the ; building toppled over upon them and buried s them. Not one escaped.” , Prof. Briggs went to Gifu, but the railroad beds had been so badly wrecked that travel • beyond was impossible. Immense crevices, r from which hot mud and steam escaped, were to be seen in all directions. During his stay s there a Japanese, who had lost his wife in , one of the crevices, went in search of her, and while standing on the edge of the fisure, • the earth crumbled beneath him and precipi ■> tated him into the unknown depths below. . All of these crevices along the roadside have since been bridged, but the danger from them s is little lessened. Professor Briggs said : j “I think this earthquake will be known as one of the most violent that has occurred during the Christian era.” Maryland Affairs. Thieves are operating in Washington county.
