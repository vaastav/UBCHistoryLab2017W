Tho attention of advertisers is directed to this fact. BEL AIK, Md. Friday Morning, - - - December 4, 1885. The President’s Message. I’residcnt Cleveland's first message was rend in Congress on Tuesday. Usually very few of the members remain to listen to the delivery of Presidential messages, preferring to read them in print, but the interest in this, the first message to Congress from a Demo cratic President for a quarter of a century, was so great that the most of the members remained quietly in their seats and listened to the long document with the greatest at tention. President Cleveland evidently regards him self as the representative of Democratic policy as laid down in the national Democratic plat form, to which he committed himself in his letter of acceptance, and the views he express es in ids message are in accord therewith. The message shows ample preparation and clear, definite views on the part of the Presi dent on every subject touched upon iu it. The document dispels the gloomy forebodings of Republican orators acd news papers, during tho Presidential campaign, that a general chaos in business affairs would follow the advent of a Democratic adminis tration. The message gives assurance to the business and industrial interests of the coun try that no legislation will be sanctioned by President Cleveland that will disturb busi ness or distress labor. The President, at the same time, is positive in Ids recommendations for a proper revision of the tariff, so that bur densome taxation upon the necessaries of life may be reduced, while at the same time American labor may be protected against ru inous competition with cheap foreign labor. The paper is long, but it treats of many sub jects, and ail witli admirable force and luci dity. The message opens with a feeling allusion to the dentil of Vice President Hendricks.— Other topics are referred to, as follows: Our foreign relations continue to bo friendly. On this point ho mentions the negotiations In progress with other governments, and praisesthe officers and men engaged In protecting American interests in tho Central American war, last spring. Ho gives his reasons for withholding from Congress tho proposed treaty with Nicaragua lor a canal through the territory of the latter at the sole cost of the United States, on tho ground that the sole ownership of such a canal outside of our own territories might bring us into conlllct with loroign nations. The message refers with regret to tho recent outbreak against tho Chinese in Wyoming Terri tory, where numbers of unoffending Chinamen wore murdered by a mob, and declares that all the power of this government should bo exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in tho treatment of these men, and the Inflexible sternness of tho law in bringing tho wrong-doers to justice should bo insisted upon. The case of Julio K. Santos, a citizen of the • v, te( iu^ unlawfully arrested ami imprison a** authorities of Ecuador, is mentioned. After an elaborate correspondence Santos was re leased. On the American hog question tho President says: “I regret to say that tho restrictions upon Che importation of our pork into France continue, notwithstanding tho abundant demonstration of the absence of sanitary danger in its use; but I entertain strong hopes that, with a better under standing of the matter, this vexatious prohibi tion will bo removed. It would bo pleasing to bo able to say as much with respect to Germany, Austria and other countries, where such lood pro ducts are absolutely excluded, without present prospect of reasonable change.'’ The marked good will between tho United btates and Groat Britain is alluded to. The Arc tic exploring steamer Alert, which was given by her Majesty sgovernrnent to aid In tho relief of the Grceiy expedition, was, after the successful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to uroat Britain. Hayti has made provision oVi-n-'. 1 k 1 V i° sses by American citizens during the lato insurrection. The case of Van Uokkclcn, who was imprisoned for debt and do med the same relief afforded native debtors was the subject of contention with Hayti. but while leased* n BK ler a **" udo s’au Uokkclcn was re- Our relations with Mexico continue cordial. Our gijud relationship with Russia continues. An officer of the navy, detailed for the purpose, is now on his way to Siberia, hearing tho testi monials voted by Congross to those who gener ously succored tho survivors of tho unfortunate Jeannette expedition. It is gratifying to advert to the cordiality of our intercourse with Spain. ’ l( J“® President refers to tho inadequacy of ex isting laws touching naturalization. no opposes certain commercial treaties with ourbou thAmori neighbors, on the ground .nL the advnat age is all on their side, tho United Slates surrendering more than is gained. dini™!Sf„V eei ? s,iD,fof . ,he appropriations for Ron u,ei^?S5 V l oe ' a ? y ; te “ of consular inspeo appointment „ f „ | imit ed number of seo f Ka i()n at , lar Fe and authorization for tho detail of army and naval officers for service as attaches at legations.

More than one-hiilf 0 f this falling off was in tho re 5?*PfJ5 fr°“ customs and nearly ail of the remaln dti in tho receipts from internal revenue. On tho subject of a reduction of the revenue, tho President says; ell'll 18 *' 0 ? ami fairnes s dictate that in any modl "°J 9 ur present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests which have been en eouraged by such laws, and in which our citizens have large investments, should not bo ruthlessly themuhlootfnVneh* l ' W< ' shoul<l also ileal with the subject In such manner as to protect the in terests of American labor, which is the capital of our workingmen: its stability and proper re for vepofl cy C m ° St Jußti,lablo ‘hose limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue.

The desire to utilize the silvcrproduct of the country, he says, "should not lead to a misuse or a perversion of this power,” intn'imin-l ‘-ooFtcss to purchase silver to coin into dollars Is questioned : but granting the right. tn the ?n 8 -rtT/•>, further purchases to add to the ~15.769.431 silver dollars In existence to-day is assumed to ho negatived by the fact that up to the present time but 50.000,000 of silver dollars lß T nmm.l?.L 0n circulation, leaving over 10,>.000,000 of them in tho custody of the govern "■cut Every month,” says the President, put ting the absurdity- ° f the Bland act in a strong light, two millions of gold in the public treasury are paid out for two millions or more of silver dollars, to ho added to the Idle mass already ac cumulated. From many points of view tho nJ of tl ."'

He mentions tho operations of the army on the tmntler. and says the fact that in a foruu of 24,705 •enlisted men and 2,154 officers there were 14,1711 (trials by court-martial last year is adverted to 'V'"' jujcummendation. and tho remark is added that if the ideas of Justice presented in some of examined are the ideas that generally P-iya n tl l *! 80 tribunals. the honor and honesty r the army demand that they be reformed. Ihe signal service. Ills suggested, should tic separately established and transferred from the " ar Department to some one of tho civil depart uientfl. President subscribes heartily to Secretary nitney s recommendations in respect to a re •orgAni/.ation of the navy. On this topic ho is very emphatic: J “If we desire to build ships for present useful mess instead of naval reminders of tho days that ■are past, we must have a department organized for the work, supplied with all the talent and in genuity our country affords, prepared to take 1 advantage of theexperlencoof other nations, sys tematized so that all efforts shall unite and lead In one direction, and fully embued with the con viction that war vessels, though new, arc useless unless they combine all that the Ingenuity of man has up to this day brought forth relating to their construction.” Hu recommends legislation for (ho more Just and humane management ( f Indians. The pension rolls are declared to be in need of 1 fdwmsinff’. being encumbered with hundred* or ihaiftcands of names placed on them by fraud. There should be no relaxation In the firm but Just execution of the antipolygamy law in Utah, from the operation of which good results are already apparent. Tho President thoroughly endorses civil service reform and ventures to hope that we shall never again be remitted to the system which distributes public positions purely us rewards for partisan service. In concluding tho President calls the attention •cK Congress to tho present condition of the law 'refuting to the succession to the Presidency In tho uvent of tho death, disability or removal of both the President and Vice President, and urge* that h repetition of the situation created by tho lamentable death of Vice President Hendricks should not he permitted. The Forty-Ninth Congress. The forty-ninth Congress begun its exist ence on Mon Jay. The Senate was organized by electing Hon. John Sherman President pro tempore, Logan having declined. Mr. Sher man made a suitable acknowledgement of the honor and after the new members, including John A. Logan, were sworn in, the Senate was ready for business. Sherman is, probably, the most objectiona ble person who could have been selected to preside over the Senate. His bloody shirt speeches and abuse of the South during the last Presidential campaign, to say nothing o( his extreme and bitter partisanship through all his public career, stamp him ns a dema gogue of the worst and most dangerous character. At the afternoon session Senator Voorhees offered appropriate resolutions regarding the death of Mr. Hendricks and providing for suitable memorial exercises. Immediately after Senator Harrison moved, in respect to the late Vice President, that the Senate ad journ and the motion was carried by a rising vote. In the House the proceedings were more lively. Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was again unanimously chosen speaker. He referred, in Ins speech upon taking the chair, to the reversal of the political relations ex isting between the two sides of the House, and appealed to the members to aid him in the impartial administration of the rules of the House. In the drawing for seats Dr. Prank T. Shaw, of this congressional district, obtained a scat by the side of Dr, ffm. H. Cole, from Baltimore. Mr. Holman, of Indiana, announced the death of Vice President Hendricks. He said : “The death of this eminent citizen, after a long period of public service, holding the second office in the gift of the public, with a reputation in public and private life of un sullied gbodness, lias occasioned a widespread expression of grief throughout the whole of the republic.” Mr. Holman’s motion to adjourn, out of respect to the memory of Mr. Hendricks, was agreed to unanimously. ' A Wise Suggestion from Mr. Tiiden. Hon. Samuel J. Tiiden has written a letter to Hon, John G. Carlisle, urging the use of the surplus revenues of the government to provide for our sea coast defenses as a para mount necessity, which ought to precede the reduction of the revenue and an excessive rapidity in the payment of the public debt.— Like everything written by Mr. Tiiden, this letter is marked by statesmanship and ster ling good sense. Mr, Tiiden points out the fact that property valued at five thousand million dollars, at least, in twelve of our At lantic seaports, is exposed to destruction, in the event of hostile naval attacks. To pro vide effectual defenses would ho the work of years, and therefore the sooner it is under taken the better. Mr. Tiiden thinks this is a most auspicious time in which to begin this woik. He adds: “It we do not make the expenditure necessary to provide for our scacoast defences when we have a surplus, and have no ueed to levy new taxes, we certainly will not make those expend itures when we have no longer a surplus in the treasury. To leave our vast interests defence less in order to reduce the cost of whisky to its consumers would be a solecism. The present time is peculiarly favorable for providing for this great national necessity, too mug neglect ed. Not only docs the surplus in the treasury supply ample means to meet this great public want without laying new burdensuuon the peo ple, but the work can now be done at a much lower cost than has ever before been possible. The defensive works would consist almost en tirely of steel and iron. These materials can now be had at an unprecedented low price. A vast supply of machinery and of labor called into existence by a great vicissitude in the steel and iron industries otters itself to our service.— We should have the satisfaction of knowing that while we were availing ourselves of the supplies which would ordinarily be unattainable, we were setting in motion important industries, and giving employment to labor in a period of depression." Mr. Tilden’s words are entitled to great weight and we have no doubt they will re ceive the most respectful consideration from Congress. Joint Cox for I’tiblic Printer. The Baltimore Sunday American says there appears to he a general belief among well-in formed politicians in Baltimore that Mr. John Cox, of that city, will receive the appoint ment of government printer. Mr. Cox has obtained powerful hacking throughout the State. The printing trade of Baltimore is almost unanimous m his favor. Mr. Cox is a thorough master of the printing business in all of its branches, and it is conceded by all who know him that no one belter qualified could be found. He has indomitable energy, great industry, and is, in other respects, an able and capable man. He was the founder and first editor of The uEgis, having started the paper in 1856, Col. John Carroll Walsh being also one of its editors.
