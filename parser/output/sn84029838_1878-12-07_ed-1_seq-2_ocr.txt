THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STOI1MS AND SUN SPOTS. The, edilor of tbe Limed CnroBOMVye con tinues his raeteorulrgical re eaicle. Irom wh ch we condense e follow: Poring tbe i-t two years, the United State ard other poitionsof thecivilired worll have been Yisiud with severe and remarkable dorms Tltir rapid succession an 1 dctructive re tulta have provoked popular comnien', acd cieated wrious alarm. Thin siries of terrible atmcwnberic dicdnrbanco invites tbe eugges tion that Iters must be some special local, cr cosmical ii iluence to account for tbe ex ceptional meteorological phenomena The recent earthquake, whose Bbock felt tbe whole leugth cf the continint, au 1 as far towards the centre as the extern border cf Kansas, undoubtedly is the effect of the 6ame force that promts itself now as a cy clone now as an earthquake. Unquestionably the disturbing caue for tbe laat two jean, is the same as that in the yeirs of the greatest frequency of remarka ble storms in tbe past. The causa of these periodical years cf violent storms, it is con cedeJ, U due to the uousual magnetic neur it of the earth at that time, and the depen dence cf this upon tbe sun' condition as to tbe areas and number of "ots. Tbe pbe DOmena of their increase and gradual de crease through constant period, has baen established by the daily observations of tbe celebrated German Astronomer S-hwabe, and tbe confirmation of his discoveries by other eminent observer?. Scbwale found that the eolir spots increase in magnitude and frequency fjr about fire yeirn and a half, and decrease through an equal period, completing the cjcle in about eleven years. Prof. Lxiiaie, in his "Aealyeis cf the observations cf many year," shows conclu sively an existent" between me sun spots period and the intensity of tcrrcatisLmsg- nelism. It is subject to proof then, that tbe meteorological disturbances under consider ation are puiely magnetic These rasgnttic variation', the result of which arc violent etorms en the earth's surface were once rensidered fitful their cause having been miptcted, but not believed periodical are equally with other distinct natural foreee, cosmical in their nature. We were struck with eitonishmeut, when list winter constructing diagrams to aeconv pany an article "Oa C.imatic Changes in he Prairie Region of tbe United States," at tbe remarkable comncidccce of tbe yeais of maximum rain-fall with tie years of greatest frequency of euu-epol6 -so much so that ve feel almcat warranted to predict for an indefinite period, jests of the maximum rainfall for Kacti-. W't are now approaching the eleven year elating the sun's rotation on itself. These spot vary, the maximum and minimum be- ins 10 a tf-oie, jeriodical. Oidmarily, the magnetic needle varies more or less towards tbe east cr wes'. Thee sudden vaiiatious have been remarked tj be greatest when the spot on the sun ara ment numerous. It has bsen obiervtd that the cyclones in tbe Indisn ocein were greater in proportion as the Sjpot on tLe sun reichtd tbr maxi mum; al-o that there i sn apiarmtcon- nrction b twe-n tbe sjlar spot) and the de gree of temperature, and the humidity oi tbe at i o'jiherr. We have this 63n directed our inquirii t to the variations of the needle anong cur Hirveyora in this section of Kansas, and learn as we Mwi-ecttd, that it o-ciIIat:cn and erratic action is more intensified than ever before known, ia some inetarces during field labor, of over thirty years. That the barometer lias assingalarlf fluctuated, we have only to refer to the record of the Sig nal Service fir extended areas." It is remarkably confirmatory of the the ory now generally acccptee': That tbe vari ations in the solar heat produce a similar variation in tie terristial evaporation, erd an increased tendency to violent storms. THE TIMES AHEAD. 'WKT&HT, BEVERLEY THE PHESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Ths President's annual message was read before Congress on Monday last, Tbe gen eral topics of the country are presented in a suggestive way the yellow lever, the pa cification of tbe South, the currency que tion and pthcr general mitten receive due consideration. Indian affairs are comment ed on. The President earnestly concurs in the recommendation for a corps of mounted Indian auxiliaries to be used in keeping the Indians oa their lestrvatiens and prevent ing disturbances on their part. He expres ses a hope that Cjrgrm will act consider ately in this important matttr. Wc are unable to fire an extended report of this important doiunient. The Arkansas City people have started another steamer down the Arkan-as rivtr. Inad.l with nrodure. They are bound to Drove that the ArkafMS is navigable, and that u i to U'conie tbe great outlet for west' n and southern Kanea to tbe Misainsipri and the sea. We hops ami believe they will be successful. Iawicuce Standard. The lanl sales of tbe A., T. & S.
