He telegraphed that he was snowbound somewhere in Wisconsin and that he could not pos sibly reach Chicago in time for the vnsas meeting.

MISTAKES ABOUT KANSAS. "Many mistakes have been made about the financial standing of Kansas continued rthe governor, "which the Million club wishes to overcome and -et right, The club wishes to put be- fore the npnnlo s tmo Imnoct -,t!for tn appointment Of a CaUCUS COm- ment of facts and of resources of this state and we are all united for the same object. "Kansas has suffered tremendously on account of the panic of 1S93. Up to that time immigration was brisk and many secured homes in the state and many were lookincr forward tn a. hnr and prosperous career. The trouble rame through the ease in borrowing money. "We got monevtoo easily from astern Investors and that was the rea ron why there were so many homeless Kansas people when the panic came. "The financial nres;iir wa foif -mm- severely in Kansas because the people depend on the land and the land de- psnds on the rainfall. Tho trftorn nirt will not be available for miti. lion unless under new methods of irri gation. Then It will become the home of thousands of happy and prosperous people." The governor told them of the growth nd history of the state. He said that It JS61, Kansas had no state institu tions. Now it had a splendid state house, a state university, hospital and a home for old oldlers and old soldiers orphans. The entire state indebted ness, he declared, was but $759,000. of which $438,000 was held as the school fund. Kansas was not full of stifferinsr and starvation, but full of wideawake people, who wanted others to join them In building up a great state. DATES OF CHAPLAIN JIIT.I.

REPUBLICAN SENATE CAUCUS. "Washington, Dec 2 The Republican senators were in caucus for half an hour after the senate adjoarned today but adjourned until "Wednesday with out taking any action on. the re-organization of the senate. Mr. Sherman was elected chairman of the caucus and Mr. Dubois secreta ry. The discussion was info-mal and centered around the question whether the Republican senators, having a plu rality but not a majority of the senate, should .attempt a re-organization with Republican officers and Republican chairmen of committees. It was evi dent that the prevailing sentiment fa vored Republican organization aid some strong speeches were made, no tably by Mr. Davis of Minnesota and Aldrich of Rhode Island, urging that there would be no combination or com promise with any element outside the ! Republican ranks, This appeared ro voice the general view of the senators and no opposition speeches were made. The question arose, however, as to whether the test of strength should re made on securing the committees or on the choice of a president pro ten. In order to present this issue, Mr. Hoar moved the appointment of a commit tee on committees, to have charge of a move to secure committee re-organization on Republican lines. Mr. Hale offered an amendment for a test on the choice of president pro tern. Jn the formal discussion following. Mr. Fryes ' name was mentioned as the probable candidate for president pro tem. Some sonat, riAin ,. f J. senators raised the point, however, tnat the president protem could not be elect- ' ed while the presiding officer was pres- I ent and acting under the senate rulfb. It was Anally decided that no vote should be taken at present and Messrs. Hoar and Hale withdrew their motions. The understanding was that a definite line of action would be agreed on at the meeting "Wednesday, following the ses sion of that day. The principal reason for the withdrawal of the resolution mne b' the char was the discovery of the fact tnat there was a lare ele- mcn ,n the caucus opposed to the se- IectIon of the committee by appoint- ment- It is now understood that when tne resolution is renewed it will be an- ionized "by a substitute providing for the election of the committee by the Washington, Dec. 2.

Chicago, Dec 2. "Wheat had a hesitat ing appearance for an hour today as to Tvtfiidh course to pursue, up or down. It decided finally upon the former and closed strong at an advance for the day of cents per bushel. The chief cause of the strength the market displayed was to be found in i&hea mount of spot wheat for shipment here and for export from New York. Ahout an hour from the opening May had declined to 60 cents, of cent below its closing value on Saturday. After the reaction to 60s cents the po sition of the bulls was forfeited from time to time by a large number of tele grams which came to hand, after that belnig in their favor. For instance, the second cables from Liverpool gave that maket pence -higher, the rise, it was said, being due to decreasing stocks of -wheat and flour, and anxiety regard ing (the political situation. The mar ket after 'the first hour became very firm and in the last thirty minutes of the session it ruled strong. May getting as high as 60 cents about five min utes from the end and it closed at 67 cents against 60 bid at the close on Saturday. December at, the wind up today was rworth 56 cents, against 56 cents 'bid on Saturday. Corn -was -weak for cash and steady for futures. The latter were kept firm toy the strength in wheat.

Colonel Henry Vlntteron to Speafe Here oc the Character of Lincoln. Colonel Henry Watterson of Ken tucky, the distinguished editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal and the greatest living orator in Dixie, will lec ture at the Garfield hall in this city. Dec 12. under the auspices of Garfield Post G. A. R. on the life and character cf Lincoln. The Kansas City Times had the following to say editorially the morning after Colonel Watterson spoke there: No one la the large and splendid atj- Sir Morrill MacKenzie, Count Maetti and Veno. In Its medical fraternity Europe never numbered two more eminent and respect ed practitioners than 6IR MORRILL MACKENZIE and COUNT MAETTL For years they have attended the most exclusive and fashionable of Europe's no bility. Veno is a native of Scotland and a fellow countryman of SIR MORRILL MACKENZIE, who feeling more than a passing interest in him on this account made him 'his confidant, and imparted to him the secrets of the remedies he Is now using in this country with such wonderful sucecss. VENO'S CURATTVE SYRUP (30c. a bottle), Is the quickest cure in the world for nervousness, dyspepsia, liver, kidney, blood and stomach troubles. It strengthens -the nerves, tones up and strengthens the stomach, cures constipa tion, purifies the blood, makes you eat and sleep good, and when used with VENO'S ELECTRIC FLUID (30c a bottle), will certainly cure the worst and most des perate forms of rheumatism, paralysis, sciatica, lame back, numbness, weak mus cles, chest troubles, and all pains and VENO'S LUNG TONIC (50c a bottle), is a quick and permanent cure for throat and lung troubles, asthma, difficult breathing, bronchitis, coughs and colds.

Guaranteed to cure or money returned. dience at the auhltorium, last night, listened to the eloquent periods of Henry "Watterson without having ac quired a 'better understanding of Lin coln, a higher ideal of patriotism and a more comprehensive knowledge of hu manity. Few men could paint the pict ure of Lincoln's life as the eloquent panegyrist of last; night presented it. Few eulogists have so rich a subject upon which to discourse. The eulogy was the tribute of a genius to the memory of one inspired to a grand work which was mastered In the time allotted to its performance. It was a narrative so simple and pathetic that it became the subject it canonized. No other man in the past or present has spoken of Lincoln as he deserves to be spoken of. Until "Watterson spoke of him no one thoroughly understood a nature that was as plain, simple and sincere as the affections of a child. In the work in which Henery "Water son is engaged he is serving humanity. He is opening the minds and hearts of his countrymen to the reception of a memory that deserves to be cherished. He is teaching the people of this coun try a lesson dn patriotism which will survive and expand after he has joined Lincoln in the Beyond, when posterity will praise him as he now justly eulo gizes the great character of the greatest epoch In modern history.

Mrs. Caroline Schneitzler fainted in the police court yesterday and no small share of excitement prevailed for some time. Fritz, her husband, was present and fanned her with an Eagle while others procured water. In a short time Mrs. Schneitzler came to again and -was quite exhausted. The cause of the accident to Mrs. Schneitzler was that she found her son "Will, injail. The young man was ar rested a short tune before that and taken to the police station. Usually men of his class are kept in the clerk's office to await hond, but on this occa sion hetwas put behind the bars. Judge Tucker having refused to accept bond until the return of the warrant by the officer who served it In due time this formality was complied with and bonds were given. Immediately after the demands of the police were satisfied "Will Schneitzler was taken charge of by the sheriff and taken to the county Jail for contempt of the district court where a temporary injunction Is hanging over the place where he was found. He gave a 5500 hond for this also and was released. At noon yesterday the chief of police and Officer Henry Forby took a search and seizure -warrant to the Citizens club which is located on the second floor of the building at U7 North Mar ket street At the entrance to the club room one of the secretaries Is always found with tickets to sell to the mem bers of the club. "With these tickets they buy -whatever refreshments are kept in the club room. The attending secretary keeps the book of membership and also the seal of the club. These were at once seized by the chief of po lice after which the two officers went Into the club room proper to seize the liquors. While taking an Inventory of the liquids the chief laid the hook of mem bership down on the end of the counter or bar and directed Constable Forby to ro after an express wagon to take the wet goods to the police station. While the chief was busy looking after the "bottles and jugs some ligbtftngered gen tleman swipea tne precious dook or membership and escaped. When the chief missed the all Important record he became much wrath and instead of taking the book, seal and liquors as he said he only intended to take he an runced that he would take everything. At the first effort the improvised bar was torn from its anchorage and then the marble top sideboard was dis mantled section by section. He wnt through that club room like a tornado and when the wagon was loaded there was nothing left The trial of the case will probably be heard this morning la the police court, the principal charges bIng against T. A. Robinson and Will Schneitzler. THE
