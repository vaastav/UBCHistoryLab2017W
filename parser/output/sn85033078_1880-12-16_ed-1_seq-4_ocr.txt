To enable the United States to do its full share of this great work, additional legislation is asked by the post master-general, tc whose recommendations espe cial attention is called. The suggestion of the postmaster-general, that it would be wise to encourage, by appropriate leg islation. the establishment of American lines of steamers by our own citizens, to carry the mails between our own ports and those of Mexico, Cen tral America. South America, and of trans-Pacifie countries, is commended to the serious considera tion of congress. The attention ot congress is also invited to the suggestions of the postmaster-general in regard to postal savings. SUPREME COURT. The necessity for additional provision, to aid in the transaction of the business of the federal courts, becomes each year more apparent. The dockets of the supreme court, and of the circuit courts, in the greater number of the circuits, are encumbered with the constant accession of cases In the former court, and in many instances in the circuit courts, years intervene before it is practi cable to bring cases to hearing. The attorney general recommends the establish ment of an intermediate court of errors and ap peals. It is recommended that the number of judges of the circuit court in each circuit with the exception of the second circuit, should be increased by the addition of another judge; in the second circuit that two should be added: and that an in termediate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to consist of the circuit judges and the circuit justice, and that in the event of the absence of either of these judges the place of the absent judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the circuit. Such an appellate court could be safely invested with large jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many cases where appeals would still be al lowed to the supreme court. The expense in curred for this intermediate court, will require a very moderate increase of the approprations for the expenses of the department of justice. Tliis recommendation is commended to the careful consideration of congress. It is evident that a delay of justice, in many in stances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now necessarily occurs iu the federal courts, which will iu this way will be remedied. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The report of the secretary of the interior, pre sents an elaborate account of the operations of that department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to he in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made grati fying progress in agriculture, herding, and me chanical pursuits. Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the government arc quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their permanent homes, building houses and engaging in the occupations of civilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial em ployment, and in stimulating their ambition to cam their own support. Their honesty, fidelity and efficiency as carriers are highly praised. The organization of a police force of Indians, lias been equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservations, and in exercising a wholesome moral influence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the secretary of the interior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased, as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter it. Much care and attention has boon devoted to the enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians. The moans available for this important object have been very inadequate. A few addi tional boarding schools at Indian agencies have been established, and the erection of building has been begun for several more, but an increase of the appropriations for this interesting under taking is greatly needed to accomoda te the large number of Indian children of school-age. The number offered by their parents from all parts of the country for education in the government schools is much larger than can be accommodated with the means at present available for that pur pose. The number of Indian pupils at the Nor mal school at Hampton, Va., under the direction of Gen. Armstrong, lias been considerably in creased, and their progress is highly encouraging. The Indian school established by the interior de partment in 1879, at Carlisle, Pa., under the di rection of Captain Pratt, has been equally suc cessful. it has now nearly two hundred pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety of the tribes cast of the Rocky Mountains. The pupils in both these institutions receive not only an ele mentary English education; but arc also instructed in housework, agriculture and useful mechanical pursuits. A similar school was established this year at Forest Grove, Ore., for the education of Indian youth on the Pacific coast. Tu addition to this, thirty-six Indian buys and girls were selected from the eastern Cherokees and placed in boarding-schools iu North Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in industrial pursuits. The interest shown by Indian parents, even among the so-called wild tribes, in the education of their children, is very gratifying, and gives promise that the results accomplished by the efforts now making will be of lasting benefit. The expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the permanent civilization-fund at the disposal of the depa -tment of the interior; but the fund is now so much reduced that the con tinuance of this beneficial work will in future de pend on specific appropriations by congress for the purpose, and I venture to express the hope that congress will not permit institutions so fruit ful of good results to perish for want of mcaus for their support. On the contrary, an increase of the number of such schools appears to me highly advisable. The past year has been unusually free from dis turbances among the Indian tribes. An agree ment has been made with the Utes. by which they surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of an annuity to be paid to them, arid agree to settle in severalty ou certain lauds designated for that purpose, as fanners, holding individual title to their land in fee-simple,inalien able for a certain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided, which, at one time, seemed imminent, and, for the first time in the his tory of the country, an Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty, and to live as individuals under the common pro tection of the laws of the country. The conduct of the Indians throughout the country, during the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla war fare carried on for two years by Victoria and his band of southern Apaches, has virtually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of his followers, on Mexican soil. The disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and bis men, who had taken refuge in the British dominions, arc also likely to cease. A large ma jority of his followers have surrendered to our military forces, and the remainder are apparently in progress of disintegration. I concur with the secretary of the interior in expressing the earnest hope that congress will at this session take favorable action on the bill pro viding for the allotment of lauds ou the different reservations in severalty tu the Indians, with pat ents conferring fee simple title inalienable for a certain period, and the eventful disposition of the residue of the reservations, for general settlement, with the consent and for the benefit of the Indi ans. placing the latter under the equal protection of the laws of the country. This measure, to gether with a vigorous prosecution of our educa tional efforts will work the most important and effective advance toward the solution of the Indi an problem, in preparing for the gradual merging of our Indian population in the great body ot American citizenship. 5 |aobicultcke. The commissioner of agriculture expresses the confident belief that his efforts in the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouraging ly rewarded. The importance of the results at tained have attracted marked attention at home, Sind have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference of many millions of dol lars annually in the wealth of the nati ,n. The report of the commissioner asks attention particularly to the continued prevalence of an in t’ectnous and contagious cattle-disease, known and Jreadcdin Europe and Asia, as cattle-plague, or pleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of great loss to our farmers, and of serious dis turbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes a market for most of our live-stock and dressed meats. The value of neat-cattle export ed from the United States for the eight months ended August 31,1550, was more than twelve mil lion dollars, and nearly double the value for the same period in 1879, an unexampled increase of export trade. Your early attention is solicited to this important matter. 

PUBUC LANDS. A large increase is reported in the disnosal of the public lands for settlement during the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of our agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement of population toward our unoccupied lands. As this movement proceeds, the codification of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the disposition of public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I therefore invite the con sideration of congress to the report and the ac companying draft ot a bill, made by the public lands commission, which were communicated by me to congress at the last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desirable. The attention of congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands, and the rapid and indiscriminate de struction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to this end is now generally rec ognized. In view of the lawless character of the depredations committed, and the disastrous conse quences which will inevitably follow their contin uance, legislation has again and again been reo- uauneiuleil to arrest tbo evil, and to preserve for the people of our western states and territories, the timber needed for domestic and other essential uses. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. The report of the director of the geological sur vey is a document of unusual interest. The con solidation of the various geological and geograph ical surveys and exporting enterprises, each of which has heretofore operated on an independent plan, without concert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to all those industries o: the country which depend upon the development of our min eral resources. The labors of our scientific men. of recognized merit, who compose the corps of geological survey, during the first season of their field operations and inquiries, seems to have been very comprehensive, and will soon be communi cated to congress in a number of volumes. The director of the survey recommends that the in vestigations carried on by his bureau, which, so far. have been confined to the so-called public land states and territories, be extended over the entire count rj, and that the necessary appropria tion be made for this purpose. This would be. par ticularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other mining interests of the Mississippi valley, and of the eastern and southern states. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of con gress. PUPLIC BUILDINGS. The secretary of the interior asks attention to the want of room in the public buildings of the capital, now existing and in progress of construc tion, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed, and of the public records. Necessity lias compelled the renting of private buildings in differentjparts of the city for the location of pub lic offices for which a large amount of rent is an nually paid, while the separation of offices belong ing to the same departments impedes the trans action of current business. The secretary sug gests that the blocks surrounding Lafayette square, on the east, north and west, be purchased as the sites for uew edifices, for the accommoda tion of the government offices, leaving the square itself intact; and that, if such buildings were con structed upon a harmonious plan of architecture, they would add much to the beauty of the na tional capital, and would, together with the treasury and the new state, navy, and war de partmentbuilding, form one of the most imposing groups of public edifices in the world. EDUCATION. The commissioner of education reports a con tinued increase of public interest in educational affairs, and that me public schools generally throughout the country arc well sustained. In dustrial training is attracting observed attention, and colleges for instruction, theoretical and prac tical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, in cluding the government schools recently establish ed for the instruction of Indian youth, are gain ing steadily in public estimation. The commis sioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on the, lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the territories and in the southern states. The recommendation heretofore made, is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands annually, the income of which, and the remainder of the net annual proceeds, to bo distributed ou some satisfactory plan to the states and territories and the District of Columbia. The success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress made, under *he intelligent direction of the board of education and the superintendent, iu supplying the educational requirements of the District, with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. The acts of congress, from time to time, donating public lands to the several states and territories in aid <>f educational interests, have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this leg islation, the wisdom of which has been so fully vindicated by experience. t> the District of Colum bia. 1 again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia to the favorable considera tion of congress. The affairs of the district, as shown by the report of the commissioners, are in a very satisfactory condition. 

AOTOMAC MARSHES. In my annual messages heretofore, and iu my special message of December 19, 1879, I have urged upon congress the necessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the capital, and lam constrained by its importance to advert again to the subject. These flats em brace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impedlent to the drainage of the city and seriously impair its health. It is believed that, with tliis substantial improvement of tis river front, the capital w< aid be, in all respects, one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is nec essarily the place of residence of persons from ever section of the country, engaged in the pub lic service. Many others reside here temporarily, for the transaction of business with the govern ment. It should not be forgotten that the land ac quired will probably be worth the cost of redeem ing it, and that the navigation of the river will be greatly improved. I therefore again invite the at tention of congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much-needed and too-loug-de iayed improvement. The water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by government is necessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the va rious departments, and a large quantity is re quired for the proper preservation of the numer ous parks and the cleansing of sewers. I recom mend that this subject receive the early atten tion of congress, and that, in * making provision for an increased supply, such means be adopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Tempor ary expedients for such a purpose cannot but be wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgement, be constructed. I commend again to the attention of congress the subject of the removal, of their present location, of the depots of the several rail roads entering the city: and I renew the recom mendations of my former messages in behalf o the erection of a building for the congressiona library, the completion of the Washington Mon ument, and of liberal appropriations iii support of the benevolent reformatory, and penal institu tions of the district.

To restore it person? whose bowels arc out of order, or whose digestion is imperfect, should use llostetter’s Stomach Bit ters, a corrective of disordered conditions of se cretive, evacuative, and digestive organs without a peer. The most serious consequences result from a neglect of reformatory measures, where constipation is allowed to gain headway. For this as for many other disorders usually found in conjunction with costiveness, such as dyspepsia, billiousness, nervous derangement, headaches, vertigo, morning nausea and the like, the Bitters has long been recognized by the public and the medical profession ns a genuinely efficacious remedy.

Two persons were burned to death at a fire in Philadelphia, on the 13th inst. The tobacco factory of James Leigh Jones, at Richmond, Va., was destroyed by fire, wiping out $30,000. By the burning of a car on the Louis ville Short Line road, Ike Adams Ex press company lost $40,000 and the rail way $15,000. The Brookfield cotton mill, at Stock port, England, has been destroyed by fire, causing a loss of $30,000 and throwing four hundred persons out of employment. A fire in a manufacturing block at Springfield, Mass., in which the chief en gineer and several firemen were injured, did damage to the amount of $125,000. About nine-tenths of the business por tion of the city of Pensacola, Fla., was de troyed by fire Saturday night, resulting in a loss of $500,000. Mr. and Airs. Irwin Stark, of Harbor, Creek, Penn., unintentially smothered their two-months’-old child while ont sleigh-riding on the 4th inst. Crawford’s opera bouse, Topeka, Kan sas, which was opened last September has been burned to the ground. Loss about $30,000; insurance $15,000. A TRAIN on the Rock Island road jump ed the track near Fdgerton Junction, Kan , on the 9th inst., and was ditched. Captain Sims, a veteran mail agent was killed, and Bellard, another postal em ploye, was badly injured. Pensacola, Fla., has suffered the loss of seventy-five buildings by fire, including the custom-house anti its records. The only steam-fire-engine in the city was so disabled that two hours were required to repair it, while the flames were raging. The estimated loss is $500,000. A conflagration in Cincinnati Satur day evening resulted in the death of five firemen. Three buildings were in flames, and in order to get in the immediate vi cinityof the fire,it was necessary to pass through the first of these. The attempt was bravely made jy a dozen firemen, five of whom perished in the desperate endeavor. FOREIGN A threatening letter received by Par nell at Waterford charges him with de stroying Ireland to save his own pocket. The sultan has evaded trouble with the ambassadors of the powers by having the keepers of the assassin of Colonel Com meraetf declare him insane. The British admiralty has at last abol ished the cat-o’-nine-tails in the navy, which, henceforth, is to be disciplined without Hogging. The Italian premier, in discussing Greco-Turkish relations, said the govern ment would never permit Italian citi zens to violate the international duties of Italy. The gravity of the situation in Ireland is increasing daily, and the announcement of a cabinet council is unexpectedly made. Mr. Forster, chief secretary for Ireland, has returned suddenly to London. The French finance minister stated in the chamber of deputies that England and Germany had several times of late mani fested a desire for a double standard, and announced that France is ready for actual overtures. ( Mrs, Gadner, who was attacked by her tenants in the west of Ireland recently, is to have a guard of 150 soldiers. Her house is in a state ot siege at present. The garrison now consists of about a dozen po licemen. The Greek premier, in an appeal to the leaders of the opposition, pronounced the country on the eve of a supreme crisis, and urged military preparations to en force the decision of the Berlin confer ence. „ Von Hatzpelt, the German ambassa dor to Turkey, has reached Berlin with what is believed to be a proposal by the porte for the settlement of the Greek question by compromise. Gladstone’s withdrawal from the house of commons is urged by his physicians, and there are rumors that, after the pres entation of the budget, Gladstone will ac cept a peerage and support the Irish land bill in the house of lords. The British cabinet has decided to an ticipate the probable parliamentary tactics of Mr. Parnell and his partisans by intro ducing a series of resolutions for the guid ance of the speaker of the house of com mons when obstruction is attempted. The Irish land league meeting at Scots town, which Pillion, O'Kelly, and Biggar called upon the government to protect, was held without interruption. The Orangemen gave up their proposed coun ter demonstrations at the same time and place. The better sense of the German people is asserting itself against the Stoecker anti- Jewish movement. In a large majority of the towns the protest against the pro scription movement has been so numerous ly signed as unite overwhelm the Stoecker party. Mr. Parnell will probably be indicted anew for his bold utterances at AVateford recently. Mr. Healy, M. P., Parnell's secretary, and Mr. AValsh have been in dicted by the Cork Grand jury for intimi dating a farmer named Manning who turn ed “land-grabber.” Notwithstanding a somewhat stormy opposition, the Greek parliament has granted the ministers of war and admiral ty all the supplies they deemed sufficient to put their respective departments in good fighting trim. Sabußoff, the Bussian ambassador at Berlin, has gene to Friedrichsruhe to con fer with Bismarck on the Greek question, and those two men will probably have a vast deal more to do in shaping events in the east than all the so-called naval demonstrations. The growth of the Irish land league is attributed by the English press to whole sale intimidations. It is alleged that even Orangemen are compelled to join or confront the danger of losing life or ! property, and that peddlers who can not show a league card are unable to sell goods. The steamship Aiosel, from Bremen. re ports having passed the White Star steam ship Republic about six hundred miles out from Xew York.

She recently sent to the Uniied States, for the use of congress, a complete edition of M. Thiers' works, which were presented to that body to* the secretary of state with a formal letter. The British government has placed two more regiments at the disposal of the Irish executive. Captain Stackpoole, a wealthy farmer, made a vain attempt to sell some horses in Limerick on the 13th inst., as a land-league bellman paraded the streets forbidding people to purchase. A landlord, named De Courey Harris, was Boycotted out of the hunting held at Charleville. The Claremorris police patrol fired on a party ©f suspected men, and captured one of them. Michael L-a vitt has been promised by Parnell sup port for the first vacancy in a home-rule borough.
