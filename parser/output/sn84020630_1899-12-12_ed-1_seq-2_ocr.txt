Seoretary Wilson, of the depurtment of ai'iriiltuie, in hia annual report de- lores the fart that so few of the farm s' class of the country pay any atten tion to ectucation in agriculture, Dut tate utut the attendance at the agri-ultui-al colleges 19 increasing, and the emand for expert help from the de partment is greater man can no sup plied. He has applied to the civil serv ice commission in vain for help, fur men lih the technical knowledge wanted re not to be had. It is the same with egard to persons well informed with egurd, to the animal industry. At the uggestion of Secretary "Wilson the civ- 1 service commission will hereattei keep a register of graduates of the ag- .ultural colleges endowed by congress for the education of farmers, and from his registry the department will ap- point young men as assistants lor me scientific divisions. This arrangement opens the way for a graduate to pursue his studies while on a salary, and to be come expert in his chosen field of labor, n which competition will not be so reat as in the ordinary pursuits of life. The secretary is doing a practical as ,-ell as just act in offering employment to young men who acquire special nowledge at the colleges. The congressional committee consid ering the case of Mr. Roberts will go to Utah to take a census of the Roberts family. The people of Denver may have gone in sleighs to church last Sunday through snow 6 inches deep, but the sleighs did not stop at the church doors most likely. Senator Billy Mason painted the nu- tinnial cauital red yesterday with his fiery denunciation of Great Britain as an oppressor of the, Boers. But ti. V. will not mind that when she finds out. that what the Illinois senator says does not count a little bit. The governor of Alaska asks that the tAn-ltorv be admitted to statehood. It will be a cold day in Alaska when sh enters the sisterhood of states without a greater population than can be count ed there now, unless the miners who lie under the ice can be counted in the cen sus. Ex-Governor Hogg, who has Colonel Bryan in Texas, appears to have put a padlock upon the mouth of the Nebras kan. No word of comment has com from the colonel since President Mc Kinley's gold standard message was printed. In other years the country would have been filled with the lurid voice of the silver candidate had such a message been 'issued. So far only one paper in New Mexic has advocated the leasing of the grass ing lands belonging to the public do main, which would ruin the smaller owners of sheep and cattle, who could not afford to lease and fence great areas, and would result in a monopol of the best lands. And that paper is the Deming Headlight, that seems have the unenviable faculty of gettin on the wrong side of every issue where the interests of New Mexico are, con cerned. The news from South Africa con tin es to be discouraging to Great Britain, ,-hich appears to have overestimated the a'bllity of her men and seriously un- restimated the skill of the enemy There is one thing to be remembered in onfliet with a country which is being nvaded. The people are fighting for the form of government they prefer and fov their homes, in a sense, even it' It be not the; custom .of civilized conquerors to seize the property and oppress the van ished. The Boers fight with the de termination; that marked the defense ot the colonies when the British undertook o perpetuate their rule in America. While the outside world may think ll were better If the Boers should be van- quished and England assume sovereign ty in the Transvaal, to the Boers the is sue is one of national life or death, and they may feel just as much concerned for personal interests and physica safety as any people have upon whom war has been made by a foreign coun try, and they fight w;ith the grim inten tion inspired by long contemplation o what they consider deliberate wrong That Great Britain will win in the end can scarcely be doubted, for her hand has been stayed with but rare excep Hons, and her wealth is great. Though her soldiers have learned a bitter les son and their fancied Invincibility has been a disappointment in a contest with those who depended less upon knowl edge of the science of war, the supe riority of numbers must triumph. Assurances have been given to the ef fect that the tariff and internal revenue acta will not be touched during the present session of congress, except i unimportant points, if at all. The pro posed currency legislation will not dis turb business. Congress will probably devote most of its time to the consider a tion of the important administrate problems which the acquisition of a new territorial domain has brought to view A larger army and navy are matters in separable from the possession of terri tory lying far off from traditional boundaries. The Nicaragua canal mat ter will come up with a better chanc for favorable action than ever before, Senator Berry of Arkansas, the col league of Senator Jones, who is the chairman of the Democratic national committee, and who may on that ae count be said to speak ex cathedra on the probable future action of the Demo crats in congress at least in the senat has Informed the New Mexican corre spondent in. Washington that the Dem ocrats will earnestly, vigorously and continuously oppose the currency bills presented by the Republicans; oppose the enactment of the gold standard, an fight against the retirement of the greenbacks; make especial opposition to giving to the banks further power to issue money. They will oppose other features of the bills, but will throw th whole might of their influence agains those parts, especially, above indicated The deposits in the national banks of Kansas City are $10,000,000 greater in amount than they were one year ago. showing an increase of 25 per cent "Poor old Misosuri" or "poor old Kan as" is now a misnomer. In fact, pov rty-Btricken states no longer exist, and even the southern states which wen despoiled by years of war have becom wealthy in money as well as in re sources. From every state come reports f increase In deposits and depositors The rich may be growing richer, but the poor are not growing poorer. They who have capital have increased chances to make more when there a profitable uses for their money other than in lending, and these uses give the poor opportunity for earnings. Bribery Not Approved. If Senator Clark, of Montana, bought his seat in the senate, and It can be proved, he should be bounced even if the man who pushes the charge of bribery against him was also seeking to purchase the prize. If the charge be proved with sufficient clearness to con vlnce the American people that the sen ator bought the votes that sent him Washington, even though he be not re fused the seat by easy-going members, tha American people will never besto that esteem upon the Montana senator that is freely given to every senator elected through popularity or by any legitimate method of political work. man1 may secure office through method for which the law provides penitentiary Imprlonment as the penalty, but he can not secure the honor which should go with the place from the masses of the people, who will continue to have thei own opinion of t'he man who wins di honestly, no matter If he doe manage Briton and Boer. Oh, the Pain of Rheumatism! Rheumatism often causes the most in- tense suffering. Many have for years vainly Bought relief from this disabling disease, and are to-day worse off than ever. Kheumattsm is a blood disease, and Swift's Speoiflc is the only cure, be cause it is the only remedy which can reach such deep-seated diseases. A few years ago I was taken with inflamma tory Rheumatism, which became bo intense that I was for weeks unable to walk. I tried several prominent physi cians and took their treat ment faithfully, but was unable to get the slight est relief. In fact, my con. dltion seemed to grow worse, the disease spread over my entire body, and J from November to March ' many patent medicines, E I but none relieved me. friend I decided to tr s 8 HefnrR allowine me to take it, how ever, my guardian, who was a chemist, ana lyzed the remedy, and pronounced it free of potash or mercury. I felt so much better after faking two bottles, that I continued the rem edy, and in two months I was oured completely. The cure was permanent, for I have never since bad a toucn oi luieuinauBm uiuuku umujr times exposed to damp and cold weather. 8711 Powelton Avenue, Philadelphia. Don't suffer longer with Rheumatism.

The Democrats are sometimes pleased at the action of a Republican official One case in point was the resignation o Speaker Reed, who was one too many for them whenever they had a scheme to hinder tha Republicans in congress But they are not getting half so muc enjoyment out of the change to Speaker Henderson as they hoped, for he has the benefit of the effective Reed rules to ai him and the slender majority of his par ty. While he may not crush the minor Ity members as emphatically and with as little regard tor tneir reelings, t-n new speaker is strictly business, and will not permit delay and foolish techni calities to bar the way to legislation, The minority have no new objection t urge to the passage of a finance bill, an tha determination of the speaker and the majority not to allow the session to be wasted in discussion of this one measure is sensible. The week which will be allowed for speeches and debat upon- the su'bject should be ample fo: every one who has anything to say to unburden himself. The country expect; many important matters to be weighe and acted upon, so the effort of Demo crats to use up the session in- arguments upon the one bill will not be approved, Their claims that they are being gaggei by being limited to a few days' time i speechmaking will not create much sympathy. The money question has had ample discussion in the last few years. and there is not a member of congress who does not already know whether he will vote for a bill establishing gold as the standard. So far as any result upo: the vote Is concerned, all speeche mlght be waived and the ayes and noes called to-day.' Talking Through His Sombrero. Mr. Loving, the optimist from For Worth, has again reached Kansas City and secured the ears of reporters of th city by the Kaw, and tells them that hi big cattle deal has again some chances of being completed. When it is finished his company, he says, will own the ma Jority of the largest ranches in Ne Mexico and Texas. The syndicate would own 1,000,000 cattle, twenty acre of land for each animal, and have $50, 000,000 capital. Mr. Loving, however, has come down from the perch whic he occupied a few months ago when h said he had secured abundant capita and mow declares that ranchmen will gladly take half the price of their ranches and cattle in stock in the com pany, and the other half of the capital will be secured, provided times are no too hard In! February. Certainly the Texas promoter 1s talking through his sombrero. Cattlemen were not bor yesterday, nor are they going to give u their property for stock in a compan which would be .managed by easier men, and In which the minority Btock owner would have no effective voice Cattle and ranches are as good money these days, and a long ways bet ter than a lot of paper certificates of stock. New Mexico has no ranches that will go in on this deal If It ever be com pleted, without cash is forthcoming And as for the majority of big ranches In the territory being on the string of the Fort Worth promoter, if he has op Hons upon any in this territory, they are confined to the plains east of th Pecos river, and Texas cattlemen con trol them. New Mexico cattlemen are enlarging their operations now, since they have been able to sell their beer cattle at good prices, are stocking up for more extensive 'breeding of a better grade of animals, andi are mot hunting any syndicate outfit to take their prop erty for paper that does not bear the to retain the official position acquired through dishonest practices in defiance! signature of the treasurer of the United of public opinion 1 States. 7 that it is class legislation of the most virulent type, having for its object the uplifting of the few to the downfall of the many. While the project looks like a paying one on its face, the Review is inclined to the belief that were the law in opera tion for a time the promoters, who now think it such a great thing for them selves, and prospective investors, would And they had a white elephant on their hands. The experience of all large land holders in N'ew Mexico is that the re turns from their holdings do not pay the taxes, and most of them have been willing to sell to smaller holders, who can look more closely after the business and thereby reap a profit, where the large holder loses money. While it is true that the small, holder would suffer at the start from such a law, the land-grabbers who paid the government even 10 cents an acre rent would find they could not realize enougc on the investment to keep up the rental, much less expend large sums in fencing to keep off encroachment. The scheme may be a paying one on paper, but woe to the capitalist who is enticed into such a delusive investment
