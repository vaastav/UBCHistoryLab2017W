The policy of paying for the con? struction of the Panama Canal, not out of current revenue, but by bond issues, wss adopted in the Spooner Act of lt*Sjat, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from tbe by which a part at leaat of af the coat of the < shall fall upon our posterity ano are it.
