JLnnval Report of the Commissioner of the Xand Office Lands Disposed of During the Year Pre emption and Hometead Rights Railway aad Special Grants. We extract from the report of Laud Commissioner Wilson the following passages of general Interest: The Public Land KyMlem. The operations of the public land system during the fiscal year ending June 80, 1H69, were prosecuted In all the public land States and Territories except Wyoming and Alaska. Murreys havo been completed In Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ala bama, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The entire area of the public domain Is 1,8.14 n,400 a'-res, of which, during the past jear, M,8i!2,s;i acres were surveyed, Involving 40.M9 lineal miles of survey. The entire area surveyed Is Bos,fl7,7o2 acres, leaving usnrvtyed l,31i6,4:io,-iH acres. Interesting aoootints of boundary surveys are given, with chorographlcal and topvgiaphlcal lnfomiuiion of great value. I.andn IHio-d of During the Year.

The homestead policy is the worthy supplement of the pre-emption. A great, increase of appropriation of public lands by uciu.nl settlers under these two classes of laws is shown. It is estimated that by direct and indirect operations of the land system (luring the last llscal y ear, 0i,ooo small limns were added to the freeholds of our republic, about double the entire number of laud owners in Knglund, as re ported In the decennial census of lsci.

A special donation has also been made to the States of BO.ouo acres for each Senator and Representative they were entitled to under the apportionment of lsoo. The aggregate amount of laud llnully accruing nnder all these frants will be not lebg than 79,K26,so2 acres. The disposition of these grants by several of the States Is given In the report. Uranta for Itullwnyn mid Internal Improve ment. The policy of grants for internal Improvements, and especially for railways, Is considered at length, and a sketch of the railway system of the Vuited Mates is given at large, lis history naturally di vides itself Into three eras: Ylrst. Its primary stage, on the Atlantic slope, In which It had to await the slow accumulations of the necessary capital for its construction. Second. Its secondary stage, In the Mississippi Valley, in which, by the donullon of public lands thcrwise unsalable, It created its owu endowment by the values it imparted to the soil. Third. Its definitive stage west of the Mississippi, In which it appeurs as a forerunner of civilization, gathering strength to project itself across great wil derness tracts to reach our Pacltl e states. At the close of the present year there will bo in operation 47,(iou miles of road. The tonnage of lscs is esti mated at over 100,000,000, representing a cash value of 112,000,000,000. At the close of this century wo -will have nut less than 100,000 miles la operation, with a tonnage beyond present estimate. The enormous expansion of railways was one of our national neces sities. The liberal policy of lauded and loan subven tions by the Government was the groundwork of this prosperous movement, but the Commissioner thinks that the time for such extraordinary assist ance has passed, and recommends its withdrawal. The Pacific Itullrond and the Future ef the Country. The report concludes with a review of the com mercial position of the United States, tracing a Hue of commerce around the earth between the 401I1 and tilth parallel, to which all the local currents of trado will converge. The completion of our Pacific Itail road, with the increasing advantage of railway com munication over every other, is making this country the highway of the world's commerce. Durability to compass this splendid result springs from ou. libel ul-handed policy. Its Influence la specially marked. The growth of our resources is startling The gold value of personal and real property Ti :uu o ,ooo,roo. Onr gross annual earnings amount to f 10,000,000,000, of which not less than ten per cent, or $1,0(10,000,000 are surplus for investment. Uur civiliza lien, being industrial In It chief characteristics, look to a broader sweep of original production, and hence our accumulation of wealth will be more rapid than that of any past age.

EASTERN QUESTION. Tor key and Eypt lotrlue of Ruaaia and France Prebable Complication. A correspondent of the New York Times, writing from Athens, gives the following details of affairs In the East: The Eastern question Is rapidly approaching a new phase of development and a possible solution, on the condition that Napoleon III remains chief of the French nation. There remains no doubt In my mind, from evidence gathered from a large correspondence on and an intimate acquaintance with the political condition of the Greek and the Greco-Slavonic pro Traces of the Ottoman Empire, that the Russian Government is making preparations for a general and surilcleutly desperate insurrection of the Chris tian population of that empire, and that the Egyptian Juestlon has been raised by the same Influences to ucrease the (Sultan's embarrassment, and at the same time to give the French Government a com mon Interest in the hoped-for solution.

Hervla and Woldo-Wallachla, as well as Bulgaria, Monteneirro. and liosnia, are well known to be in readiness, or getting to be so, to unite in auy movement, and the probable appointment of General Ignatieir, late Minister to Constantinople, as Councillor of the Empire, Is, in all probability, the igual for the commencement of operations, as It Is well known that he Is the advocate of the most energetic movements towards Stamboul, not directly, but a? the object of a union of tlio Sclavonic tribes. who. lu tiieir utter incapacity to orguul.o themselves Into a separate uutiou, will fall into the hands ef Russia at 110 distant period.

This has always keen the Russian policy towards Greece, to use her against Turkey, and at the sume time exhaust her by Internal troubles and external embarrassments. The constitutional statesmen of Greece, aware of this policy, have long since been earnestly opposing Hussian Influence lu Greece, but the King being lu the hands 01 tne czar, mej cuu accompiuiu nuiuiug without revolution, which no one desires at present. The Cretans at the End of the Innnrrerllea. Having been Intimately connected with all th it related to tho Cretan Insurrection, I am perfectly competent Ui declare that at the time of the actual end of the Cretan Insurrection the Cretans were, re latively to the forces which could he brought against them, In a better condition to resist than they had been at any previous time, and that tlie new and complete reorganization of tho insurrection on a better basis than It had ever before had, was being prepared, and only demanded a sum of a'sikk) to complete and carry through tho winter, when the Insurrection, nearly ready in other pirM of the Turkish empire, would have broken out notably that of the Ix banon, whoso chief, Joseph Karani, was waiting at Athens the signal to move. The then governing Minislrv in Greece (appointed virtually by Russia, whose control over the King was absolute), which bad been for a year manieii vrlng to compel the Insurrection to break Itself down, bnt dared to take 110 direct steps to that end from fear of a ponnlar rising, finally planned and sent the famous I'ttroponeakl epedltiou for the express purpose of breaking the insurrection down, and, at the same time, by apparently favoring It, to save themselves from popular Indig nation. The plot was so transparent that though It succeeded In crushing Crete, the Ministry fell with, it, and the King was only saved by tlio dread of the consequences of a revolution In the critical state in which Greece then was. I'nitlnnd, Aumrln, unit Circece. Kussla hopes to paralyze Austria, which Is the party principally Interested, by J'riiHslau hostility und Nclavic Insurrection, and In the present Inert disposition of England to carry the question through without dangerous struggle, or a delay which would enable tho Republicans of Europe t enter Into the contest, Tlie only combiimtioii wlilch can stop the success of the plan is an union of ICnglund, Austria and Greece In support, of Turkey, with neutrality of Prussia und Italy. This combination Kussla hope to prevent by using the influence of the I.nited States to paruly.e England uad prevent her from making any direct resistance to the Intrigues or tlio C.ar, and to menace retaliation for the of fences committed ugaiust us during I lie great In surrection. The Influence of America. As a question when, for the first time, the influence of Ihe United states enters into European combi nation, it behooves us to consider well the effect of our exercise of It, and casting uside all petty hostili ties and momentary Irritation, t throw the weight of onr moral influence in favor of p.-ogress and civili zation. It Is, perhaps, the first time lu this century that the English policy has been in perfect accord with that of Christianity and human liberty, and no nobler satisfaction for all the injuries we have re- eiveti tti ncr mums count oe taken man to assist her to do the working out of our owu principles. No unman interest requires mat Jtussiu should make new l'olauds on the Mediterranean ; that she should extend the order of Warsaw to Athens and Siberia to the Himalayas. Itiisalun predominance in the Levant Is the death of all the rising republicanism of Eastern Europe, und equally of American influence there. As an earnest watcher, if not active participant, during theCrettiu Insurrection; us intimately con versant with the inner history of the utl'.ur' from beginning to tlie end, I can positively assert that there was no political Influence which the Russian ngeuts were so hostile to 11s that of America, and though they employed it to the furtherance of their nefarious plans, and do still employ it, through the iiiigcnuy-circuiaicu statement mar, itussia and the 1'nlted States are in accord on the Eastern question, they were Invuriably opposed to any step which would increase our lmld oil tlie popular feeling. The ItiiMslan Church. Mv known sympathies and trials on behalf of the Christian subjects of Turkey leave me In no doubtful color, so far as that empire is concerned. I clung to Cretan liberty while It had a shadow of hone, but, now that that struggle is over, anil the soil covers our common dead, I ain equally earnest In saying that the Interests of Christianity and humanity de mand tne support or Turkey as against Russia, ami the gradual development or the civilization of the East through Greek as opposed to Musco vite ecclesiastical Influences. We all know what Russian political progress means, bnt we do not all know that tho itusslan 'hurch is being built up into a Papacy more formi dably organized and more strongly iron-clad than that of Koine can ever have been ; an intolerable und despotic appliance of the Stale to the indlvidu- utv or us subject, wmie tne urecK i.nurcu preserves the municipal character and freedom of thought by which it has always been distinguished from that of Koine, and wmcn it borrows irom me republican huractcr 01 us people in ine uuys wuen 11 was planted there by tlie apostles. its gradual ueveiopuicui cuiiuui, nui 10 uovoiop a large, healthy Protestantism, when popular educa tion is suillclently advanced to become the basis of religious freedom. The Turk, again, Is, with all his barbarism and fanaticism, toieruut or religious teaching, and too weak to prevent political progress. ills empire win yield iu lime 10 a syBU!in or reiiuon- can States, growing up In its decay, and confederated one day lu an eastern Switzerland, united in religion and Interests, if not In tongue, while ltussluu supremacy will crush republicanism and religious freedom together. The People of (Jreeee. The present Kingdom of Greece is the only possi ble nucleus of political development for tho East, and, with all lu faults and crudities of organization, has done ana is doing mncu to prepare tne race in other provinces for political freedom. I have lived with the Greeks four years, in relations the most in timate, and in circumstances tne most trying to na tional character, and, though no Phllhollene on my arrival in the country, 1 can declare that I have never lived with any people more worthy, In spite of their faults, the moral support of the civilized world, more inorougniy imoucu wun me political virtues most necessary to political existence or comparable with them for private und domestic virtue. Of their ntc 1 oi-uce and uptituae lor progress no ono ever doubted who knew them, and tho testimony not only of my own experlence.but of many foreigners who have resided for years among them, Is that as to probity and honesty they in no sense merit the refutation prejudiced and outwitted travellers have given tnciu. 1 no more one Knows ine pc p:e the more one must honor tliem. It does not become our people in the coming struggle te exercise an influence adverse to the ad vancement or tne oniy race irom wnom anyiuing 111 the way of political progress in tho East can be anticipated or with whom we can have any political sympathy, In order to punish England for theoffiiiiue against us. I know that Kussla counts largely 011 a certain moral support from our defiant attitude towaros Kngiana. our oniv nooie ana great poncy in tne case is to give England to understand that so far as she main tains the Interest of civilization we will sustain her with our friendship, and postpone ir not coudone all questions lu abeyance between ns.

Blsmark." lKCH-IHGG, a work Is about to Issue from the Paris press which may be found to contribute useful materials to future histories of that eventful period. Its author, M. Villebort, was in Germany durimr the campaign of 1SC6, was present at most of its stirring scenes, and seems 10 nave neen on very irienniy and almost Intimate terms with Count Blsinark, of whom he saw a good deal. We must be prepared, therefore, for sotno leaning towards the hero of the lime; but so far as lean Judge from a hasty perusal of that portion of the as yet unpublished work which has reached my hauds, the author dues not shrink frovi criticizing an well as praising his friend aud host. The following pas sage Is carious and interesting: "On the 7tli or August 1 went to tuke leave of M. Illsmark, by whom, at Berlin, before and' after the war, at Horsitz and at Ntkolsburg, 1 had always been re ceived with a kindness of which I retain the most lively remembrance. Towards 10 at night I win lu the Prune Minister's cabiuet, when the French Ambassador, M. Ilenedettl, was announced. 'Go and take a cup of tea lu the drawing room,' M. llismurk said to me; 'I will be with you shortly.' Two hours passed, midnight struck, then 1 lu the morning. About twenty persons, the family and in timate frlonds, awaited the master of the house. "At lust he appeared, with a calm and smiling countenance. We took tea aud smoked and drank beer in tlie truo German fashion. Tlie conversation, alternately grave and gay, tutuwd on Germany, ltly, and France, humors or war with France then cir culated In Berlin. At the moment of learotaklng, 'Monsieur le Mluistre,' I said, 'Will you allow me u ask you a strangely indiscreet question, Is it pttace or war that I carry back to Paris?' M. Ulsmark answered promptly, 'A durable friendship with France 1 1 llrmly hope that France and Prussia will henceforward form the dualism of Intelligence aud progress.' "1 (aneied I detected a singular smile on the lips of a man destined to occupy a distinguished place In Prussian politics, the lTivy Councillor Baron von KerdelL Next morning I called upon him and told him how much that smile had puzzled me. 'Give me your word of honor to keep what 1 am going to tell joo a secret until you reach Paris; before a fortnight we hall have war on the R Ine M Frave persists In bar territorial demands, bheasksw.i't we neither can nor will give her. Prussia wi I never yield an Inch of German ground; we could nut do It without rac ing all Germany against ns, and, if It etines to that, we would rather raise her against Frame than against our selves.' That step of the Tulleries Cabinet, so profoundly Impolitic, and unskillful at snob a mo ment, and which resulted In a check given to Fr.uu.li diplomacy, was of wonderful servi to M. HMmark in all his enterprises on Germany. It furnished htm with an Irresistible argument to prove the necessity of great armaments against France, at the same time that his refusal to give np the least morsel of German soil still further exalted tho prestige of Prussia In the eyes of every German patriot."

In pursuance of the proclamation of President Graut, appointing 'ihursduy, the lsth of Novemier, for a national thanksgiving, and in accordance with the invitation Issued by tlie committee (Messrs. Post, Itrownn. Hhattuek, and Tilfany), a large por tion of the Americans In Vienna, ladies and gentle men, assembled at 6 o'clock In the extensive hall of the "Welsses Koss," which was tastefully decorated for the occasion with the flags of Austria and Ame rica, In tokeii of the growing cordiality of the two nations. The busts of the Emperor and Empress, together with a portrait of General Grim, occupied a conspicuous position amid the ornamentation of tlio extensive hull, while a band of mt.sie, gave at appropriate Intervals the national airs of the two countries. At the conclusion of tlie dinner Hon. John .lay, the American Minister, gave the first toast, "The President of the United States." A toast to the Emperor or Austria followed, tlio company re ceiving this toast as they had done that to the President of the United Siates, standing and with three cheers, mid the bund jilaved an Austrian anthem. The minister, in Introducing the third sentiment, alluded to the recent, names which it enumerated, nnd among others, "Raymond, of the American Press; Hawllns. Secretary of War; Senator FeKsenden, and George Peabodv," and the company rose and honored in silence. The toast was, "The memory of the dead ol American history, to whom wo owe the Freedom, the Unity, and Hie tone of the Eeptibllc." The fourth toast, to "The Army and Navy of the United Stales," was responded to by General P. S. Post lu an Directive speech. The fifth, "The American Congress, Senate, and House, representing United Stales and a har monious people." was briefly spoken on by Dr. Norris. The sixth, "Our Common Schools, the nurseries or morality and patriotism, or law and order, never to bo controlled by sects or factions," was expatiated ou by Mr. J. F. Dc.luplamc. The seventh, "The American Press," called forth Inte resting speeches from Mr. Mil as, who had been for fifteen yeurs associated with the press of the United States, ami who gave some comparative statistics of the newspapers on the two continents, nnd by Mr. Kirsch, who concluded un effective speech, In which he eulogized the progressive press of Austria, by proposing a toast to a cordial understanding be tween the press of Austria nnd the United States, which was received with hearty cheers. The eighth, "The American Clergy." was to have been responded totythe Eight Kev. Bishop Coxe, of Western New York, but he had been unexpectedly obliged to leave Vienna, and in the Blsliop's absence It was spoken on by Or. Joslah L. Hall. The last toast, "Our Coun trywomen." was responded to by Dr. Shattuck, amid cordial applause, after which the company separated. 

AQUATIC. " International HcuUera' Match In KniOnnd. From the London Times, fiov. 22. On Friday afternoon a scullers' match for XfiO a side was rowed on the Tyne between Walter Brown, of Portland, Maine, champion sculler of the United States, and William Sadler, of Putney, a younger brother of Joseph Sadler, of Surbiton, with whom the American was matched some weeks ago, but to whom he paid forfeit. It was stipulated in the agreement between the men that the race should be rowed between the High Level and Scotswood Sus pension bridges; but that, in order to avoid rough water, It should be either up on the flood or down on the ebb, whichever was the more propitious, as the umpire might determine. On the morning of the match day Mr. W. Johnson, of Newcastle, who hud been apHlnted umpire, Inspected the river, and as a strong wind was blowing from the westward, decided that the race should be rowed down rrom Scotswood to the High Level bridger, the water being somewhat rough while the tide was flowing, but by no means so much so as on the previous day. When above the Mansion Ilonse, or within one hun dred aud and twenty yards or the Uigh-Ixjvcl Bridge. Saddler stopped from exhaustion and nearly fell out or the bout. Brown, who was utterly incapable of an effort, and thoroughly rowed out, consequently went away and passed the post an easy winner, Sadler being incapable or conipleting the course anil being lifted out of his boat. The time to the spot where Sadler stopped was 21 minutes 2G seconds,and Brown reached the bridge within another half minute. On all sides nothing was heard but loud expressions of admiration at the gallant manner In which the London mau, after rowing a stern race, and a losing one tor three miles, had endeavored to turn the fortune of the day at the last moment, the oldest habitues of the river dwelling upon the self evident fact that both men were thoroughly ex hausted, und that the American was fortunate in just pulling through. At last, therefore, the merits of the champion waterman of the United States have been fully tested, aud that ho la not tlie great sculler he was supposed to be has been abundantly demon strated.

The two cau tiously approached the church, und peering in at the open window saw a mau. by the aid of his dark lantern, cutting out a panel of the door leading Into the audience-room.
