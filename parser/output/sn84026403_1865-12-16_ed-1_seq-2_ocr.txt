L-lHiigMmimi i nil j ! m n neet eonli1crntion of Congrwe. The Sen ary of the Trensur j will la; before you a 11 and detailed report of tho receipts and isburserucnts of tho Inst fiscal year, of tliv Erst quarter ot the present fiscal year, of the probable receipt aud expenditure for the other thrco quArttrs, anil the estimatts for the year following tho 80th of June, 1800. I nii!ht contont myself with a reference to that report, in which you will find all the information required for your deliberations and decision. JBut the paramount impor tance of the subject so presses itself on my mind, that I cannot but lay before you my Views of the measures which aro required for the good character, and, I might also ay, for the existence of this people. The life of a republic lies certainly in the energy, virtue aud intelligence of Hi citi eens, but it is equally true tliut a good reve nue system is the life of an organized Govern ment. I meet you at a time when the nation lias voluntarily burdened itself with a debt unprecedented in our annuls. Vast as its amount, it fades away into nothing when compared with the countless blessings that will be conferred upon our country and upon man by the preservation of the na tion's life. Now, on the first occasion of tho meeting of Congress since the return of peace, it is of the utmost importance to in augurate a just policy, which shall at once be put in motion, and . which shall com mend itself to those who shull come alter us for its continuance. We must aim at nothing less than the complete efl'acement of the finauciul evils that necessarily follow a state ot war. We must endeavor to apply the earliest remedy to tjie dernugeil state of the curren cy, and not shrink from devising u policy which, without being oppressive to the peo ple, shall immediately begia to effect a re duction of the debt, aud, if persisted in, discharge it fully within a definitely fixed number of years. It is our first duty to preparo in earnest for our recovery from the ever increasing evils of an irredeemable currency, without a sudden revulsion, and yet without untime ly procrastination. For that end we must, each in our respective positions, prrpaio tlie wav. I hold it the duty of the Executive to insist upon frugality iu the expenditures; and a sparing economy is itself a great na tional resource. Of the bunks which au thority has been given to issue notes secured bv bonds of the United States, we may re quire the greatest moderation and prudence, and the law must be rigidly enforced when its limits are exceeded. We may, each one of us, counsel our ac tive and enterprising countrymen to be constantly on their guard, to liquidate debts coutracted in a paper currency, and, bv conducting business as nearly as possible on a system of cash payments or abort cred its, to hold themselves prepared to return to the standard of gold and silver. To aid our fellow citizens in the prudent manage ment of their monetary affairs, the duty de volves on us to diminish by law the amount of money now in circulation. Five years ago the bank note circulation of the country amounted to not much more than 1200,000,000. Now the circulation, bank and national, exceeds $700,000,000. The simple statement of the fact recom mends more strongly than any . words of mine could do, the necessity of our restrain ing this expansion. The gradual reduction of the currency is the ouly measure thatcan Bave the business of the country from disas trous calamities; and this can be almost imperceptibly accomplished by gradually funding the national circulation iu securities that may be made redeemable at the pleasure of the Government. Our debt is doubly secure first in the actual vreullh anil still greater undeveloped resources of tits country; and next in the character of our institutions. The most in telligent observers among political econo mists linvo not failed to remark, tliut the Dublic debt of a country is sufu in propor tion as its people are free; that the debt of a republic is the safest of all. Our history confirms and establishes the theory, nnd is, I firmly believe, destined to give it a still more signal illustration. The secret of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in a republic the national obligations are distributed more widely through countless numbers in all classes of society; it has its root in the char acter of our laws. Here all men contribute to the public welfare, and bear their fair share of the public burdens. ' During thu war, under the impulses of patriotism, tho men of the great body of tho people, with out regard to their own comparative want of wealth, thronged to our armies and filled our fleets of war, and held themselves ready to offer their lives for the public good. Now, in their turff, the property and income of the country should bear their just pro portion of the burden of taxation, while in our impost system, through means of which increased vitality is incidentally imparted to ail the industrial interests of the nation, the duties should be so adjusted (is to fall favoured cltl'bS khould demand freedom from assessment, und the taxes should be SO dis- . -i . ,1 , .'li ,i,,i ilif nnnr tnbutwl us not to lull unduly on the poor but rather on the accumulated wealth oi tbe country.

Our tlomcsllo content now happily ended, has left some traces incur relations with one. at lean, of the great marutime Powers. The formal accordance oi ulligerent rights to the Insurgent Nates was unpre dentod, arid has nol been justified by the Issue, liut iu the systems of neutrality pursued by the Powers which wade that collection, there was a marked difference The maturiuls of war for Ihe insurgent States were furnished, itwi groat measure, from tho workshops of Ureal firman, and British ships, manned by British subject and prepared fur receiving Brit ish nrinamenia, s.iile.l from Ihe porta of Uruut Uritian to make war on American commerce, under the shelter of a commission froui the insurgent states. These ships, having once escaped fioin British ports, eror afterwards entered thoin in every part of the world, to refl:, and so to renew their depreda tions. The consequences of this oonduct were most disastrous to the Sluteg then in rebellion. Increasing their desolation and misery by the prolongaticn of our civil contest. It bad, moreover, ihe cllcet, to great extont. to drive the American flg from tho and to transfer much of our shipping and our oommeroe to tho yery Power whose subjects had cre ated Ihe necessity for such a cbauge. These events took place before I was oalled to the administration of the Government. The sincere desire for peaco by which I am nnimatod led me to approve the pro la sal. already made, to submit the quostions which bad thus arisen between tho two ouuulrius to arbi tration. These questions arc of such moment that they hum have commanded the attention of the great powers, auil are so interwoven with tho peace and interests of every one of them as to have insured an impartial decision. I regret to inform you that Great Britain de clined the arbitrament, but, ou the other hand, Invited tls to the formation of a joiut commission to' set tie mutual claims between the two countries, from which those for the depredations before' mentioned should be excluded. The proposition, in that very ur stWfnctory form, has been declined. The United States did not present tho subject as tin impenehmei.t of the good faith of a Power which wus professing the most friendly dispositions, but as involving ques tions of public law, of which the settlement is essential to the peace of nations; and, though pecuniary reparation to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally on a decision against Great Britain, such com pensation was not their primary object. They li id a higher motive, and it was in the interests of peuce and justice to establish im portant principles of international law. The correspondence will be placed before you. The ground on which the British Minister rests his justification is, substantially, that the muiiieipal law of a nution, and "the do mestic interpretations of that law, are the measure of its duty as a neutral; and I feel bound to declare mv opinion belore the world, that that justification cannot be sus tained before tho tribunal of -nationals. At the siimc time I do not advise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation. Fcr the future, friendship between the two coun tries must rest on the basis of mutual justice. From the moment of the cstalishine lit of our free Constitution, tho civilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in the interests of democracy or of monarchy; but through ull those revolutions the United States have wisely and firmly refused to be come propagandists of republicanism,. It is tho only government suited to our condition; but we have never sought to impose it on other; aud we have consistently followed the advice of Washington to recommend it ouly by the careful preservation and prudent use of the blessing. 'Dining all the intervening period the policy of Eurcpean powers and and of the United States has, on the whole, been harmonious. Twice, Indeed, rumors of the invasion of some parts of America, in tho interest of monarchy, have prevailed; twice my predecessors have hud occasion to announce the views of this nation in respect to such interference. On both occasions Ihe remonstrance of tho United Stntos was respected, from a deep conviction, on the part of European governments, that the system of non-interference and mutual abstinence from piopaguudism was the true rule for the two hemis pheres. .Sinco those times wo have advanced in wealth and power; but we retain the same purpose to leave tho nations of Europe to choose their own dynasties and form their own systems of govern ment. This consistent moderation may justly de mand a corresponding moderation. a should re gard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to the cause of gool gorernment. and to tbo peace of tho world, should any Eurcpean power challenge the Amer ican people, us it were, to tho defense of repub licanism uguinst fuieigu interference. Wo cannot foraeu and nro willing to consider what opportunities niijjlit present themselves, what combinations might olTcr to protect ourselves against designs inimical lo our form of government. Tbo V nileJ Suites ucsire lo act in the future as they havo ever acted heretofore; they will never ho driven from that course but by tho agression of European Powers; and we rely on the wisdom and justice of those Powers to respect the system of non-inter-ferencu which bus so long been sanctioned by lime, and which, by its guod rusulUP, has upproved iLscjlf to both continents.

The business of .his city is not iu as pro9 pcroii9 a condition as appearances indicato Merchants and traders arc not easy in tho position they occupy.

The lecommendntions of the Secretary of tho Treasury to contract the Bank issues and ro duce the currency to its former limit, nearly so, meets with much opposition. There is one thing certain, that the contrac tion from 700 millions to 200 millions, of dollars or even 400 millions, cannot be accomplished without a great revulsion in the money markec.

The last number of the London Sjxrtiitor remarks as follows, in a long review of President Lincoln's life and services: "To our minds no funeral oration ever ex ceeded in pathos that spoken ty the Presi dent, in dedicating as a natiouul cemetery part of the battle-field of Uettvbburg. Nor can the message in which. bcorc the issue of tbe emuuc'atioii prociaiuutioii, he en tered the border Slutus to bacritice slavery, not at tiieir own expense, but at the expense of die nation, lie cusily surpassed in the depth and earnestness of its entreaty." And, again, spcuking of his religious char acter, it says: "Perhaps Mr. Lincoln's religious fuith and simplicity are the only traits which still re main unappreciated by the American people at large. For ourselves we Cannot read his last inaugural address, delivered ouly live weeks before his assassination, without a renewed conviction tliut it is the noblest political document known to history, and should have for the nation and the states men hu left behind him something of a sa cred and almost prophetic authority.
