The of ficial of the Santa Fe to-night make public the details of an arrangement made with the opposition attorneys, in the now fa il cui- alien land law case, by which the ncesity of a. receiver for the Santa Fe it obviated and the case will go to the fcipher courts without any further attempt to deprtvo the present officials of the road of control of the property. Judge Myers has agreed to this arrangement and is sued an order relieving the Santa. Fe from th(. necessity of turning over property to Receiver Martin, who had been appointed by the court at the opening of the litiga tion in Jefferson county. On November S the district court of Jef ferson county. Km., appointed a receiver of the property of the Atchison; Topeka. & Santa Fe Railroad Company in Kansas, under the alien act of that state. Prior to the receiver taking- posssion of the prop erty, the railway company filed papers removing- the case from the state court to the United States circuit court of Kansas, and a motion was made by the state to remand the case to the state court, which has been, argued twice and a decision of it Is to be rendered to-morrow. Pending the hearing of this matter in the United States court, the railway company filed an answer to the petition of the state in the tate court, protesting against the Juris diction of the state court, but denying the fact that 21 per cent of Its stock was held by aliens, which was and Is a ma terial question under the law. The com pany then set up four special defenses, which were: First That its stock was not held by such aliens at the time of the purchase of the property sought to be for feited. Second That the act of the leg islature known an the alien law, under which the proceedings were had, never was voted upon by the house of representatives at the session at which It purported to havo been passed. Third That the act is in violation of the laws and constitu tion of the United States. Fourth That the act is In violation of the state con stitution itself. Upon this answer being filed the at torneys for the respective parties had a conference, and as a result of It made a stipulation which reads as follows: "lit the district court of Jefferson county, Kansas. The state of Kansas, plaintiff, Against the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company, defendants. Whereas, it Is deemed for the best interests of the parties hereto, and of the public, that the above entitled cause should be proceeded with to an early determination, and that in the meantime, and until the case is finally disposed of, that the defendant should be permitted to operate its rail road as heretofore.

Decline)! the Gift for Which the Lon don Tclcsrnpli I Raining? n Subscription. London, Dec. 7. Mr. Bayard, the United States ambassador, has written to the Dally Telegraph confirming the report cabled to the Associated Press on Saturday that he would decline the proffered Christ mas gift, intended as a compliment to him, and In honor of his efforts to bring about an era of good feeling between the United States and Great Britain. He has asked the proprietors of the newspaper not to proceed to carry out their "kind and gen erous proposition" along the lines pro posed. He then proceeds to describe the manner In' which he first learned of the proposal, Thursday afternoon, by reading the announcement in the columns of the Telegraph. He says that he was naturally deeply touched and gratified still more when the following issues of the paper contained so many spontaneous tributes of respect and kind feeling from men of all classes, occupations and varying degrees of fortune. Continuing, he says: "A few hours of reflection have brought me to tho sober Judgment that,, holding my present office, invested with its discretion and duties-, I should scrupulously respect and obey the spirit, as well as the letter, of my coun try's law, written and unwritten, which in hibits anyone holding an office of trust or profit under the United States- of America from accepting, 'without the consent of congress, any present from any king, prince or government.' "The reasons for this Inhibition apply with special significance to the represent atives of the government abroad." Mr. Rayard continues his comment, re marking that republican forms of govern ment require strict and delicate obedience to such principles, so that not even the smell of smoke can lurk in the folds of official garments. "The ermine, of tho Judge," says Mr. Bayard, "should not be more stainless than the robe of the lawgiver, nor that of the legislator than of the executive of ficer. "The patriotic and admirable intent of your influential journal has been surely ac complished, for it has evoked such explo sions of widespread sympathy and approv al, as, iikt the breath of the ocean, will fill the sails of two great ships of state as they are borne onward by the irresisti ble currents of our common civilization.' " Ambassador Bayard concludes with an expression of blncere gratitude, and says that "while I live I will not cease to think the people of these Islands for the whole hearted and unstinted welcome and warm hospitality showered upon mo and mine. 1 am sure I serve both countries best when I decide, as ambassador, not to receive the valuable and most delightful present pro nosed." In an editorial, the Telegraph announces that the donations will be returned, and repudiates tho charges of "meanness and presumption," but "no regrets for the ac tion taken" are expressed, since such prompt sympathy throughout England and America has been produced, as evinced by the cablegrams received from. Frederick It. Coudert, E. L. Godkin, ex-Governor Flow er, Bishop Potter. President Eliot, of Har vard university, and others. In conclusion, the Telegraph says, ed itorially: "If the effort failed of its im mediate and innocent purjiose, it has gone far enough to prove the sincere good will of tho nation towards Ambassador Bayard."

WEYLER SURROUNDED GENERAL 3IACEO'S ARMY OV EITHER SIDE OF RIM. INSURGENTS NEAR HAVANA. SEVEX THOUSAND ENCAMPED WITH IN TWENTY MILES. Daily Fight Within n Few allies of the Capital Movement on Foot to Capture Wejler on His Way Dock to Hn- vnnn. Key West, Fla., Dec. 6. The steamer Whitney brought Havana news this morn ing in relation to Maceo and Weyler. Pas sengers state that Weyler himself is now encamped ten miles from Artemisa, and his army is scattered along the trocha and through the Pinar del Rio district. When Maceo retreated from Weyler in his first campaign, his plan was to surprise Weyler at the first opportunity, and now Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler, and they are having daily skir mishes. Weyler is completely surrounded, and If he shall attempt to move he will be com pelled to go to Artemisa. Small bands havo crossed tho trocha into Havana dis trict and are attacking the outposts and villages of that province Insurgents numbering 7,000 are encamped In Havana province, twenty miles from Havana, and will go to Maceo's assistance when needed. Spies in Havana are keep ing the insurgents posted as to tho move ments of the Spanish troops. A movement is on foot to capture Wey. ler if he shall attempt to go to Havma by rail. Firemen and volunteers in Ha. vana are being sent to Weyler'sl relier. Heretofore these troops were used in the defense of the city. Since Tuesday's raid on Guanabacoa, the city has been attacked almost every night, and Thursday night 250 Cuban cavalry rods for two hours through the city. The dam ago done amounts to thirty-six houses burned and a large quantity of supplies and ammunition seized; also a large num ber of mules, loaded and ready to leave the city, were taken. Over 500 refugees havo passed into Ha vana during the past five days from that section, fearing for their lives, during the lights between the soldiers and the insur gents. Nearly all the Havana volunteers have gone to the front, but as fast as they rout the guerrillas in one place they encounter them in another, making a succession of running fights, all within five to ten mile of the city. About 100 soldiers have been killed or wounded so far in these engage ments. DEATH OF A NOTORIOUS WOMAN "Red Kate," 'One of ih'ivMoiit Famous" Shoplifters In the United States, nt Rest. New York, Dec. 6. "Red Kate," one of the most famous shoplifters who ever lived in the United States, is dead, from a complication of diseases, superinduced by alcoholism. She came to her end in the famous "Red Light," a shantj- on the shores of Coney Island. Kate was about 50 years of age, and nasi widow of "Red" Leary, the bank burglar and general thief, whose picture, together with hers, adorned the rogues' gallery. "Red Kate's" history was an Interesting one. When young she was pretty, and posw sessed a fascination which won for her many friends. She is said to have been the instigator and originator of many daring burglaries, and It is said that the famous Manhattan bank burglary was arranged and planned by her and executed by her husband and his pals. "Red" Leary was arrested for the crime, but a few days later Kate located his cell In the Tombs, and, renting a room In a house adjoining the prison, with the assistance of a couple of accomplices, dug her way through the fireplace and the wall of the prison and rescued her husband. At the time Leary owned a saloon, at the foot of Fourth ave nue, in Fort Hamilton, where he was aft erward arrested by Robert Plnkerton and a couple of his detectives, after a desper ate struggle. It was after the Manhattan bank robbery, and about fifteen years ago, that "Red" lary and his wife located at Coney island and erected what has ever since been known as the "Red Light" on a section which was then considered beyond the pale of civilization. Some years ago, after a heavy robbery, the New York detectives located some of the supposed robbers there and raided the house. Nothing was found inside, but after digging In the rand about tfO.OOO worth of silks, carefully wrapped in oilcloths, were unearthed. Kate was arrested, but man aged to again get off. "Red" I.e:iry left Kate some years ago and finally met his fate in a street fight, where his skull was fractured with a brick. It was only a month ago that three men were arrested in Kate's house, charged with robbing Frank Livingstone's house at Coney Island. The police believe that Kate had concocted the plan, but she died as she had lived, true to her associates, and it Is said of her that during her whole life she had never once turned state's evi dence, even to save herself.

C Sixty of the men employed by the Connor Logging Company at Stratford had a miraculous escape from cremation. The house in which they were lodged Is a flimsy pine structure, and when fire broke out at midnight they es caped with great difficulty.

LITTLE LIKELY TO BE DONE. REPUBLICANS TO IGNORE THE DING LEY TARIFF HILL. Repnhlicnn Senators to Cnncns to De termine on a' Policy Senate May Take Up Some Calendar RnnlneMs President'. MeHMnpre To-day. Washington, Dec 6. That to-night was the eve of a new session of congress was apparent in the Washington hotels, which are always 'barometers of political activity. Senators arad members cominjr to the city by every train, reinforced by the attaches and lookers-on of congress, were drifting into the lobbies, greeting one another like schoolboys after a vacation, with much handshaking, with reminiscences of the campaign, and many explanations of how fheir re-election or defeat had been brought about. There has been comparatively small in terest in the work of the coming session itself, apart from the president's message, but clouds of speculation were afloat, deal ing with the policies of the new adminis tration to be inaugurated on tho 4th of March and with, the personnel of the cab inet. It was unanimously conceded that the Republican programme iris to ignore the Dingley tariff bill and to summon an extra session of the Fifty-fifth congress for the 15th of March, for the purpose of passing a new tariff measure, so these features of the situation which have absorbed the at tention of politicians recently had ceased to be of interest. In their place came the cabinet predictions and the message. Curi osity was expressed over what reference, if any, President Cleveland might make to the Issues and the result of tho presi dential campaign, and particularly as to his policy upon the Cuban question. Huiiliii the Central Figrnre. Tho central figure of the night was Mr. Marcus A. Hanna, who Is looked upon hero as the advance agent of the McKinley ad. ministration, with a commission to feel the pulse of congress and to communicate the policy of the president-elect to "the leaders. When Mr. Hanna appeared in tha Arlington lobby after his dinner, accom panied by II. C. Payne, of Wisconsin, who is slated as a cabinet probability: C. W. Dawes, of Chicago, a member of the Re publican committee, and General Horace Porter, the marshal of the inauguration parade, the party was surrounded by con. gressmen and other politicians, who es. corted them- to Mr. Hanna's rooms. The Republican chairman had been invisible during the day, trying to put aside politics for a Sunday, he .explained: but thrjugh out,Kthe evenlng'he was'beset by visitors. ' Some of the most conspicuous men about the hotel, most of whom talked with Mr. Hanna during the evening, were Senators Piatt, of Connecticut, and Aldrich, of Rhode Island: Chairman Babcock and Vice Chairman Mercer, of the congressional campaign committee; General Grosvenor, of Ohio: Congressmen Lacey, of Iowa, Gil lett. McCormack and Wilson, of New York; Foss, Belknap and Larimer, of Illi nois; Chairman Cannon, of the committee on appropriations of the house, and "Dea con" S. V. AVhite, the New York financier, who served a term in congress and seldom fails to attend the opening of a session. Chairman Did Little Talking. With most of his callers. Mr. Hanna did much listening and little talking. The chief purpose of his visit, to make prellminary arrangements for the Inauguration cere monies, was dropped over Sunday, and the local politicians Interested in the matter were not In evidence. Mr. Hanna had breakfasted lato with ex-Congressman Ben Butterworth, of Ohio, and W. W. Dudley, former commissioner of pensions, and hail spent the afternoon driving with Senators Sherman, of Ohio, and Proctor, of Ver mont. Regarding the position of chair man of the inauguration committee, which has been tendered to Mr. S. V. Woodward, a prominent business man of tho city, Mr. Payne said: "Mr. Woodward will give a definite answer to-morrow. He fears that the duties of the position- would take more time than he could spare from his business. He has talked with others who have been connected with inauguration committees, who tell him that he would be obligMl to devote two-thirds of his time this winter to the work. He does not feel that he can make the sacrifice." Mr. Payne said emphatically that Mr. Woodward's hesitation was not inspired by the objections made against him by local Republicans on the ground that he is a gold Democrat. The Matter of Henilqnarler. The visit to Washington of Mr. Dawes, of. Chicago, is said to be connected with the proposition to maintain permanent Re publican headquarters at the capital, which will be discussed while Mr. Hanna is here. Chairman Babcock, of the congressional committee, was non-committal when asked whether his organization would join with the national committee in the project, say ing the matte'- would have to be discussed by the committee. Interest in the affairs of the Hawaiian republic has been rekindled by the dinner which was given Saturday night by ex Secretary of State lohn W. Foster to Mr. Hanna. The guests, who numbered a doz en. Included the Hawaiian minister of for e.gn affairs, Mr. Cooper, who Is In the' city; Minister Hatch and Secretary Hast ings, of the Hawaiian legation, and half a dozen members of the senate committee on foreign relations, among them Senators Morgan. Hale and Lodge, who are advo cates of annexation. It is believed that the movement for annexation is to be brought forward again with the advent of the next administration, and it is likely to be one of the leading questions with which President McKinley and the Fifty fifth consress will have to deal. Programme In the Scnntp. Vice President Stevenson, who is now in the city, will call the senate to order at rroon on Monday. The first day of the ses sion will be devoted almost entirely to re ceiving the president's message, provided It is sent in on Monday, as It is generally conceded it will be. Immediately after the oper.ing prayer, committees will be ap pointed to notify the president and the house of representatives that the senate Is organized and ready to receive communi cation and proceed with business. The senate will then, in all probability, take a recess until it becomes known whether the president will send his message In on that day. If precedents are followed, there will be an adjournment soon after the receipt of the message. The first week of the session is not ex pected to be productive of any important results In a legislative way. There are many senators who think that little or nothing should be done beyond the pas sage of the appropriation bills at this session-, and as these -measures necessarily originate in the house, there will be a disposition to postpone the season of activ ity until gome of these bills cn be received from the other end of the capltol. The probabilities are that the daily sessions at the beginning will be comparatively brief, and that the senate will content itself with four days' work each week. The calendar presents a wide range of material for consideration, -n case the sen ate shows a disposition to busy itself. In this is included the immigration bill, which i3 the "unfinished business;" the Pacific funding bill, the statehood bills and the Dingley tariff and bond bills, as well as the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Senators Lodge and Chandler have an nounced their determination to press the Immigration bill to a vote as speedily as possible. It will be the first regular busi ness to be taken up. and canrjot be dis placed except by vote or unanimous con sent. They hope to gt the bill through be fore the holidays. It is also possible that the president's message may suggest sub jects for speeches, and ther are those who predict tnat the Cuban question will re ceive vigorous attention from the begin ning of the session. It is generally agreed that the Republic ans will hold a caucus to determine upon a line of policy, especially with reference to the tariff and until after the exchange of views which this conference will per mit, no step is likely to be taken which will commit tho party to any position on any question of political significance. Work In the House The opening week promises to see the hcuse put its shoulder to the wheel of the regular appropriation bills. Chairman Cannon and the committee on appropria tions were at work all last week, and It Is their earnest intention to pays two and possibly three of the bills before the" Christmas holidays. The pension and leg islative appropriation bills are about ready, and work on one or the other of these will be begun in the house before the week closes. The pension bill, although It carries a larger amount of money than any of the other supply bills. Is very hrief, and unless some political discussion is precipitated is not likely to consume much time in its considerat'on. Beyond these two bills, nothing is in sight at pres ent. It is. of course, not unlikely that the cemmittee on rules will provide something for the house to do in case the committee on appropriations is not prepared to go ahead with either of these appropriation bills. The course of the legislation so far as the important measures on the calendar is concerned (like the Pacific railroad fund ing bill, the Nicaragua canal bill, etc.). will be determined entirely by the rules committee. But it is safe to assume that nothing will be allowed to block the ap propriation bills as they are reported for action. They always have the right of way at the short session. To-morrow, the opening day, will probably be devoted en tirely to the readinsr of the president's message.
