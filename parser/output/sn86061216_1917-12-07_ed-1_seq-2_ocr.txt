In this way the Austria-Hungary govern ment evades a direct answer to the American inquiry, but in its argument it substantially adheres to the de claration of January 31, 1917, fpr it states that 'the entire declaration is essentially nothing else than a warn ing to the efTect that no merchant ship may navigate the sea zones ac curately defined in the declaration and that the ite perial and royal gov ernment is, however, unable to ac cept a responsibility for the loss of human lives which, nevertheless, may result from the destruction of armed ships or ships encountered in the closed zones.'
