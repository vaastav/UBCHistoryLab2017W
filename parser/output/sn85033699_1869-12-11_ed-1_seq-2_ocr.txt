His appa ratus, he believes, will immensely reduce the expense of telegraphing, and that it vrilLnVonqe envo lime and money are the fealfertS in Its favor that he presents. Telegraphing is a heavy item in the ex penses of a newspaper, and it is hoped this invention will prove all lhat i; promidea. Speacixo of reading the lVebident'a message in the House of Representatives, the Washington correspondent of the New Yorii Herald says : " When lhat pffrttffli of the document was reached whu-h recommends that an a t be passed authorizing the Governor of Geigia to convene the memliers originally elected to the Legislature, requiring each mi mbcr to .take the. oath prescribed by the recon struction acts, and none to be admitted who were Ineligible nmler tho third clause of tlie fourteenth am.-ndment, gome one on the floor said, 'Well, that's radical enough,'' and immediately there was a burst of applanse on the Republican side, followed by hisses on the Democratic eida. Tlie demonstration, which was of a asoaicatary character, was suppressed by the speaker, who brought down his gavcTSvitli great force upon his desk. The recommendation for the repeal of the tenure -of-ofllec act created some sarniisemsn:, especially (among the Democrats, who seemed to think it a good joke a' the expense of the Republi cans. Ben.

In the, onviiniion . w'hicli Jramed "this constitution-tha Radicals had a majority, andj it"walnpon the motion of a Radical member 4hal the clause rendering negroes ineligible-to hold office was inserted. This, was probably done to give the carpet-baggers and white scalawags an o'pporluniy to monopolize all the. OiDces in the State. Willi the emulsion of the Hlciral neitrb members b fhc.

Grant, in his! message to Congress, after recapitula ting the facts in relation to--the recon struction of Georgia and' stating 1hat "the Legislature met and performed all the acts then required of them by the re construction acts of Congress," mentions their subsequent expulsion of the colored members of that body and the admission of !somc membcra "who are disqualified by. the third clause of tho fourteenth amendment to the constitution," and re commends that Congress should enact, "without delay,1' a law authorizing the Governor of the State to convene the members of the Legislature originally elected, give the negroes their seats, and exclude the white members who cannot take the iron-clad oath. So it appears that the President is a party to the con spiracy to rob Georgia of her rights as a St at c, which she had supposed were secured by her compliance with all the requirements of Congress, and to place the control of her affairs in the hands of the negroes anjl carpet-baggers, so as to secure the. election of two more Radical United States Senators, and to advance in other ways the interests of the carpet-bag party in the State. The Augusta, Macon and Columbus papers explain the whole of this shameful conspiracj-. The Republi can Slate Central Committee held a cau cus at Atlanta on the 1st in.st., and re solved to attempt to induce Congress "to lake a snap judgment upon Georgia," be fore the Legislature could of its own mo tion satisfy the demands of Congress by reseating the negro members and ratify ing the fifteenth amendment. They agreed to ask Congress to annul all legislation so far had under the consti tution cf 1867, put the State under a gu bernatorial dictatorship, with Bullock as supreme reconstructor, so that, backed by the military power, "the negroes should be reseated and the Legislature purged of every man who cannot take the recon struction test oath." This is exactly what tlie caucus resolved to ask on the 1st of December; it is exactly what President Grant recommends on the Cth or Decem ber. Gov. Bullock departed for Wash ington immediately after the caucus, and tliat he has lad good success in his mis sion, says the New York World, the President's message abundantly proves. Before he left Georgia, Bullock issued an extraordinary proclama tion, reciting at length numer ous so-called political outrages com mitted during the past fourteen months, for the purpose of taking it to Washing ton and displaying it there as evidence that a state of intolerance towards Radi cals and Republicans exists in Georgia. None of these outrages have any political bearing at all; audvcn Forney, who vis ited Georgia a short time ago, wa3 so im pressed with the peaceful and harmonious state of things there that he printed the othcrday, in one of his papers, an appeal to Congress to let all the Southern people alone for the future, on the ground that they were doing well enough and that all further interference with them would be prejudicial and inju rious. But the conspiracy has suc ceeded, as far as the President is con cerned; he has shown his willingntss to be made the tool of the Georgia carpet baggers; and it now remains to be seen if Congress will be equally subservient. The adventurers and scalawags demand that the whole work of reconstruction be done over again, in order that they may be kept in power a little longer. There i3, per haps, a faint hope thai Congress will re fuse to aid their schemes, at such n cost ; although, now that the President lias been made a party to the conspiracy, the chances of its success arc only too great. oiiit .vcvv caitcurr jiijcj:. The President ha3 appointed nine Cir cuit Judges, whoso duty under the law it is to transact the business in the Federal Circuit Courts which has heretofore been transacted by the Associate Justices of the Supremo Court. This will permit a continuous session of the Supreme Court at Wash'uigton. Hon. George 11. Yea man, of Kentucky, has been appointed Judge of the Sixth Circuit, composed of the States of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. The Congressional Di rectory gives the following biographical sketch of him: "Geo. IL Ycaman vvasboniiii Hardin county, Ky., Nov. 1, 1820, leccivcd his early education under many difficulties : studied law and came to the bar in his twenty-third year, entering upon the prac tice of his profession at Owensboro, Daviess count-, Ky. In 1854, he was elected Judge of Daviess county, and from that time until ISoH, devoted his whole attention to the law, acquiring an extensive practice in the Circuit Court and in the Court of Appeals. In 1801, he was elected tothcLegislature of Kentucky, and in 18C2, he was engaged in raising tv regiment for the Union service; but when J. S. Jackson resigned, he was elected as his successor as Representative from Ken tucky to tho Thirty-seventh Congress, serving on the Committee on Military Af fairs, and was re-elected to the Thirty eight Congress, serving on the same Com mittee. He was Minister to Stockholm under President Johnson. We learn from the Cincinnati Com mercial that in the Kentucky Legisla ture, on the 13th of September, 1801, Mr. Ycaman, a member of the House from the county of Daviess, read and laid on the table the following joint resolu tions : "Resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, That wo deeply deplore and condemn the re- Icent proclamation of martial law in Mis jsouri by Gen. John C. Fremont, as being unauthorized by law, subversive ot civil institutions, harsh in its provisions, dan gerous in its vagueness, and inflicting cruel and unusual puuihments.

Yeaman introduced joint resolutions as follows: "Resolved, by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Tliat the government of the United States, in resisting and suppressing the rebellion, need not and ought not to interfere with the property rights of loyal citizens or those not aiding the rebellion. "Resolved, That in the disposition of any property legally confiscated to tho use of the government, the object should be to punish treason and suppress the rebel lion, and no such property should be con fiscated, used or disposed of so as, by the action of the government, to alter per manently the legal or political status of slaves. "Resolved, That the causes for which property may be confiscated, the kinds that may be, and the term for which it may be, are questions of judicial cogniz ance, which we leave for the courts to de termine. "Resolved, That while we are willing to meet, in a spirit of conciliation, those who are willing to be reasoned with, we do now affirm that wo have no com promises or terms to offer to those who, in advance, reject all terms compatible with the authority and existence of the government, and especially none to those of Kentucky who, in their public pro ceedings, have 'bid defiance' to both the federal and State governments. They must either submit unconditionally to the to the constitution and laws of tlie United States, or conquer the government ; there fore, the first thing to be done is to try which is the stronger, the rebellion or the Government. "Resolved, That the people of Ken tucky will continue to determine their conduct toward the federal Government by their own relations with that Govern ment ; that they will address themselves to their own grievances when any arise, and not to the grievances, supposed or real, of their enemies ; tliat they will not make the complaints of those vt ho begun the rebellion without justification a cause for revolutionizing their own Government or their connection with the federal Gov ernment : and that whatever sympathy they once may have bad with the people of the seceded States, Kentucky will not make corilmon cause with those who are using .all their power to subjugate her people and make a conquest of her terri tory. "Resolved, That the Government of the United States would violate every prin ciple of right and humanity, and be made infamous in the eyes of the civilized world, by putting arms in the hands of slaves ; therefore, we do not for a mo ment believe it will invoke the assistance of such allies. If the Government can not support and defend itself without their assistance, it had belter surrender the struggle now." Judging from these resolutions of Judge Yeaman, the people of Kentucky and Tennessee have much cause to be thank fid that he was appointed instead of lion. Horace JIaynard. Judge Trigg was the choice of Tennessee, and the bar and peo ple will regret that he did not receive the appointment. Till: MAi'l'V 

IFAJIIIV. We are pained to learn that our Radi cal brethren cannot dwell together in uni ty. We find the Nashville correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, (Radical) un d(.r date of Dec. 7, unkind and uncharita ble enough to make some very uncompli mentary remarks, about our venerable United States Senator, who hails from the Metropolis of East Tennessee. In order that our readera may see in its fullness the lack of appreciation which this Radical correspondent has of our Ex-Governor and present Senator, we make the follow ing extract from the letter : Very few men have made so many and so persistent and plausible misrepresenta tions about Republicans in Tennessee as this correspondent of the New York Times and the Cincinnati Commercial. Hence e ery Republican in East Tennes see was well pleased when Senator Brown low caused Capt. Rick's nomination as Pension Agent at Knoxville.to be defeated. Though, to make a full statement of the whole truth, they were by no means equally pleased at seeing Bnnvnlow's son-in-law, Dr. Iloyntou, (late of Ohio.), ap pointed to the place. The general feeling was that it was getting quite too much of the Rrownlow family, to have the father in the United States Senate ; one son re ceiver of a delinquent railway, with plenty to get and nothing to do ; another son superintendent of another railway, wboe only fitness lay hi the fact that he knew enough to distinguish tolerably well be tween a hand-car and a locomo tive, and whose only claim was the fact of his being a Brownluw: and lastly a daughtw's husband coining in for a good and profitable government ap pointment on the strength of being hus band as aforesaid. This grasping selfish ness was so conspicuous, so greedy and so shameless, that tho body of Republicans nil through East Tennessee had begun get ting alienated from the old Governor, even before the canvass between Stokes and Sentcr began. When that fatal split came, the common instinct of all Repub licans in the State even of those that went for Sentgr told them that Brown low, in espousing Seuter's cause, was flying in the face of all his own record as a loyal man, and had joined himself to men who had been dMnyal to their gov ernment and murderously hostile to such as had remained loyal to it. This could in no way be clazed over by Brownlow's "cards" and l'earne's editorials ; neither could it be blinked by those that wanted to screen the offender from the just wrath and lien- indignation of EastTennessceans, who found themselves betrayed by their leaders. All these thingsbcing so, it need surprise no one abroad, to be told that the most utterly detested men to-day, in Tennessee, between the Mississippi and Allcghanies is Win. G. Browulow. His former enemies hate and revile him as heartily as ever, and his former friends think of him with loathing and name him with cursing. Before quitting this business of Brown low, I may as well mention that among the many who have descended into graves of their own digging, is his henchman, Dr. Thomas A. Pearne, late editor of the Knoxvillc lT77, a man whose overbear- : ing arrogance had r.licnate most of the ; Republicans he came in contact with, and whose ctowuixh rudencs3 would have ' raised the admiring envy of a loorat Cape Colony. I Thus has sunk from conspicuous place, the msn whose violence and blackguard ism have done more damage to the char acter of Tennessee Republicans at homo and to their reputation abroad, than ran ' be mended by years of good conduct. And the farewells we waft to Wm. G. Brownlow are few and very faint, for wc know too well how that "the evil men do, lives after them" the good isToft in-'
