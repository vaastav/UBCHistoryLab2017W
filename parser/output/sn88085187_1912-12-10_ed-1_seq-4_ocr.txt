MUTTON AND YOUR DAILY MEAT BILL If you would cut the cost of living, abandon the pig and steer and huy sheep. The cheapest beef that can be bought in tho Tacoma market is the brisket, which is pretty poor stuff, and it costs 10 cents a pound. Good mutton for stewing ran be bought for seven cents iv local markets, while round steak of beef costs IK cents a pound. Shoulder of pork is 18, but shoulder of lamb is 121/., iini \ niutton is cheaper still. Ham is 20 cents, but a leg of mutton can be secured from the butcher for 121 o cents a pound. All along the line mutton is cheaper than either pork or beef. The discrepancy is due practically to the fact that the American people have grown to be beef and pork eaters and have overlooked the nutritious and wholesome sheep. ' The demand is for beef or pork— ami the dealers make you pay for it. Just as they make you pay "JO cents a pound for calf's liver now which you used to buy for five cents —a demand has been created for it by educating the people to like it. \ In view of this the National Woo Mi rowers' association has started a campaign to educate the people to the use of mutton. They know as soon as the people learn to eat mutton the demand will force the price up and rais ing sheep will become more profitable. In the meantime the people who buy sheep now will get the benefit of the low price. And an epicure will tell you that for something real fine there is nothing in the meat line from a porterhouse ro&st to a corn-fed gobbler that beats a leg of lamb. SAVE THE FIREMEN'S PENSION PLAN The history of the firemen's pension fund in Tacoma would make ex cellent reading for a jokebook. In theory the law contemplates that a firemen's fund shall be estab lished from which money shall be drawn to pay those who because of their hazardous employment are injured or to compensate the families of those who are killed. In practical operation in Tacoma tin; firemen's pension fund has apparently been a grab bag. Commissioner Mills thought it going a little strong yesterday when a fireman pulled money out of the fund for a boil. But that is not as bad as some of them. One fireman a few weeks ago put in a bill and it was actually voted through to pay him because he cut himself in shaving. The Times believes heartily in a pension fund for firemen, but the oper ation of the present one in Tacoma is such that enemies of the whole sys tem of municipal or state pensions are getting a lot of arguments to bolster them up and give a black eye to a really meritorious scheme. The city commission will do well to give the pension plan immediate attention. IN THE 

SPAN OF ONE LIFE The fact is recorded that "Charles Davenport, aged 97, Inventor of the locomotive cab and pilot and the builder of the first wrought-iron bridge in the United States," has just died at Zoar, Ohio. Such facts and a little reflection show what wonderful, what gigantic strides, the world is making in an inventive and mechanical way. In that man's lifetime have conic all the present railway locomotives, all the modern steel structures, both bridges and buildings, for the steel buildings were based on the steel bridge principle, and all that has come about through the employment of those principles in mechanics. A new world has been cre ated since the beginning of his practical activity. And can anyone doubt that the next century will bring forth achieve ments fully as marvelous? After hearing that Frisco Chinese orator recently it was a foregone con clusion that the Commercial club here would endorse the recognition of the republic of China. Once more the city commission dodges responsibility on the testing of Green river pipe and shifts it onto "ex perts." The house has passed a resolution authorizing the appointment at a sal ary of $60 per month of a messenger to the committee on the disposition of useless papers. This does not include President Taft's messages. Manchurian Chinese have taken to wearing canes and tight shoes. The march of civilization is just spoiling some mighty fine heathen.

TOO BUSY TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT The messenger from Miirs surveyed the multitude which hnd fathered to meet him with undisguised interest. Nor did lie hesiliite to propound such inquiries as his curiosity prompted, "Where do yon all live?" be asked, speaking generally "I live in the future," said a young man, good humoredly. "And I In the past," said an old man. "How odd? And does none of you live In the present?" There DM an awkward lUence. "Pardon nu*," said the Martian, hastily. "Perhaps I press my questions too closely." At (his a voice from the outskirts of the crowd spoke up, saying: "We huvc uot yet learned him to live in the present without interruption of business, don't you know."
