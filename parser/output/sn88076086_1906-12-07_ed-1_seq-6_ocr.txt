It must be built by men, and by those men alone who live in or near it those who make their homes within its borders or in the neighborhood. One man alone cannot build a city, but one man who is a leader can do a great deal with the help of the rest. The people of a village may possibly see it grow to a city under favorable conditions with very little effort on their part, in spite of their policy to let nature and the old town take her course, but this is a rare case. One good ener getic leader in whom the citi zens have confidence, support ed by the other citizens and their united effort, is the best •way to build a city. The first element is citizen ship a class of business men who are noted for their honesty and high moral character, men "whose tricks in trade are to tell the truth men more noted for their honesty than for the money they have made, though it is nothing against a man that he has prospered. The second is a true idea of what builds a city, whether it is paved streets or horse racing a water supply or a ball team a sewer system or a dog show good roads or grand celebra tions all cost money, and all this money is solicited and con tributed 4 'for the benefit of the town." Bottineau is noted for having the first element, a class of citizens and business men who are thoroughly reliable, whose warranty of all wool is as good as a check on the bank. But like most other towns it is moie or less divided on the idea of what is best for the town, whether it is the spec tacular three days celebration with an awful good time, or permanent public improve, merit. Everybod}7 enjoys a good time it is true, but when indulged in too often as a pub lic function it is liable to cost so much the people will feel too poor to pay for permanent public improvements. Bottineau should have a water works and sewer system. Every citizen admits this fact, yet all apparently wonder why 44somebody" don't make a start. On the hills, only a short distance away, at an ele vation of three hundred feet, are numerous springs that can easily be brought into the city in a water pipe, and the springs are said to be able to furnish an abundant supply of water for a population of four to five thousand people, and the best spring water in the world, too. This would furnish a fire pro tection second to none in the northwest. Should the popu lation ever increase to more than these springs will supply, the main can easily be contin ued to other lakes, and event ually to Metigoshe, which has has been estimated to be suffi cient to supply a population of from fifty to one hundred thous and. Then too, we have a nat ural outlet in the creek that flows through town for a sewer system. The town could not be better situated naturally for the best water and sewer sys tem in the whole northwest than it is. All that remains is to build it. There is something of a nat ural antipathy to a private corporation being given the franchise, but as the debt limit of the city is contracted within the narrow limits precribed by the constitution there may be •no other way out of it. A sys tem built owned and operated by the city would be best, but if that cannot be had we should not necessarily reject the other. A private company, operating under a charter from the city, if it furnished the necessary water, will be better than none at all. This is a matter every citizen who owns a lot is interested in. The Courant would be pleased -to have them express their views, if they have any,through its columns. CAR SHORTAGE. The question car shortage has become an important one in this state. So far we have watched the daily press and read the complaints that are being made, but we are unable to say what is the cause. At Bottineau only one of the six elevators are full. The only cars the managers are able to get are those that come here with loads, and they load them with wheat. One statement has it that railroads have plenty of cars, but are unable to buy engines enough to move them. It is said one of the northwestern railways placed an order for 120 new engines they just got 2( of them during the year, and in that time they turned 15 old ones into the scrap pile, leaving them with a net gain of 11 engines for the year. It is also claimed all the available power is used in moving load ed cars both ways, making it next to impossible to move empty cars for wheat ship ments. Whatever the cause, the ef fect in most sections of the state is disastrous, and the peo ple want to know why. If the roads are doing all that is pos sible to be done there is certain ly no cause to complain. If the cause is manipulation by those interested, something is liable to happen that should not happen. It would seem there is due the public from the railway managers a statement as to causes, and the prospect of re lief. TO SUBSCRIBERS. This week the Courant sent out bills for subscription to those who were in arrears. We trust every man who gets one of these will give us prompt response with the cash. Your label should show at all times the date to which you have paid. Figure from this date to January 1, 1907. These labels are changed the first of each month, and those who pay during December need not expect to find their date chang ed until after the first of the year. w- Anyone who pays duri*ig December, and don't have his label changed on the first issue in January, may come in and have the error corrected, and also get his money back. Pay the bill and watch the label change. THE MESSAGE. The message of President Roosevelt to congress, which was read at the joint session Monday, is given in full in this issue of the Courant. The message occupies over sixteen columns of small type, and con tains nearly twenty-eight thous and words. On the whole it is character istic of the best citizenship in all walks of life as typified by the president himself. It is well worth reading. AN 

EXCHANGE has it figured out that the insufgents are the victors in the late state election contest, and entitled to dictate the terms of republican peace, if that is what we are to have in the presidential election two years from now. Let us have peace—and consider the terms agreed to. A united republi can effort will restore the old republican majorities in the state. To continue the factions will elect more democrats. ACCORDING to the Evening Press of Grand Forks, the fu ture platform of the North Da kota democracy is to be John Burke. The republicans had a convention at Jamestown, and ran lagely to personal platform. The democrats have our con sent to follow the same tictacs if they want to, but republicans can't get fat on that kind of feed any longer. That sagacious old bird, the Bottineau Courant, says that the state doesn't need any re forming, that its affairs are ab solutely alright. The same pa per says that the democratic party, as a party, has made no gains in the state.—Evening Press. Well, no one has denied the allegation up to date. Mrs. Alice C. Hager of St. Thomas, has written a histori cal sketch of the old Pembina country which makes mighty interesting—as well as instruc- A brass band has been organ ized at Rugby. •l- Minot may get a new opera house next year. 9 Kenmare's electric light plant will begin operation in about two weeks. A boy in Mandan has a pet badger which he uses a motive power for his hand sled. •i» A democratic daily newspap er is scheduled for Williston, to be edited by B. G. Whitehead, formerly of the Grand Forks Evening Press. Negotiations are in progress at St. Paul it is claimed look ing to the transfer of the Great Northern sleeping and dining car service to the Pullman com pany the first of next year. The Pullman company it is claimed will take over the Great North ern sleeping and dining car equipment, and as an evidence that the change is certain it is claimed that already many of the Great Northern cars have been painted from a green to the dense black of the Pullman service. The question always comes up: What is a gentlemen? Some people say he is a man with a silk hat, and others a man with a smooth tongue. But men connected with the newspaper trade have a canon of their own. "Mr. Editor," said a patron one day, THE BOTTINEAU COURANT, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1906. •i' E. S. Wetherbee is the new editor of the Mandan Pioneer. The Devils Lake Journal has commenced issuing a daily edi tion. •i' Deer are reported to be scarce out on the Missouri slope this year. A coal famine is threatened in many towns throughout the state. It is estimated that Major Murphy's second trial will cost in the neighborhood of $16,000. Mike De la Bere offers to fur nish the liquids if Col. Hager and Gov. Wilson will only drink together. •i» A juvenile brass band has been organized at Bismarck, with Prof. Carl Schulz as in structor. I Three of the four justices of the peace elected in LaMoure county at the recent election are newspaper men. Mandan and Williston have organized military companies and have been mustered into the service of the state. Richard Kane was convicted of manslaughter at Towner last week ank and sentenced to two years and half in the pen. 1* U. S. officers have made sev eral arrests in the Dickinson land district for perjury in ob-j taining title to homesteads. 'I* Flickertaii Facts 6fuf Fancies 44how ask gentlemen for money.'' Mr. Editor, 4soo" is it you never call on me to pay for your paper?" "Oh," said the man of types, 44we never 4 deed," the patron replied, in­ 44how do you manage to get along if they do not pa^." 4Why," said 4after a certain time we conclude he is not a gentleman and then we ask him for it."—Ex. Editoa Bailey of the Britt (Iowa) Tribune, says he has in vented a patent cow milker that beats all former inventions along this line. He says: "We have just succeed in getting a patent on an electric motor fas tened on the rump of a cow, the electricity being generated by a small dynamo attached to her tail. It strains the milk and hangs up the pail and strainer. A small phonograph accomjpaneis the outfit which yells every time she moves. If she lifts her foot to kick a little dingus slips over a condivias and the phonograph says 44dammet" and if she con­ tinues to kick a hinged arm catches the stool and lams her on the back till it loosens a patch of hair as big as a dust pan. A patent churn goes with the outfit that works the butter in one and hair in another." Jamestown had a coal famine last week. The tax sales in Ward county for several years last past will likely be declared void on ac count of the delinquent tax list not be published in a daily paper if there is one in the county. Rev. Batten of the Congrega tional church at Valley City, has received a call to the pas torate of the Emanuel Congre gational church of Brooklyn, New York. Postage stamps of the issue of 1907, put on sale at 6,000 presidential postoffices, will bear on their face the name of the state and city in which the postoffice is situated. The chief reason for this innovation is said at the postoffice depart ment to be the belief that it will help to do away with the big postoffice robberies and make it much easier to trace i criminals. Another reason I for the change is to enable the postoffice department to deter I mine the amount of business done by the different postoffices and prevent padding through stamps sold at some offices to residents who do business in adjoining cities. •i' The business men of Mentone are taking a unique way to get even with the mail order housed of Chicago. They have been payiilg dray men $40 a month to get the names of those who were re ceiving freight from these mail order houses. When one of these parties went into a store to buy any thing on credit he was refused, no matter how good his finan cial standing was. When they had butter and eggs they were told to sell their products to Montgomery Ward & Co. The result was that the town was put on a cash basis, and the people were forced to quit trading with the mail order liduses. The Mandan Independent ex plains why newspapers are sent to subscribers after they are de linquent and says: 4'Every weekly newspaper in towns of this size are forced to do this. Should we stop subscription when time expires nine times out of ten the subscribers would give a "calling down" for in sinuating that his credit was not good. Rather than to cast a reflection against the honesty of a subscriber to pay a small debt, it next to a necessity for a home paper to continue after the time has expired. It is not necessary for the city dailies or weeklies to follow this rule, as their subscribers live at a dis tance and are not personal friends as is the case with a majority of our subscribers. Our subscribers should deem it an honor to know that we do not doubt their integrity and continue to send them the pap er after the time has expired. Should any desire their sub scriptions discontinued they should notify us and remit to date if they have not already done so." Frequently tpyographical er rors creep into newspapers, and the result is often humorous, bringing forth many a laugh, even on serious subjects. The Tribune has had more than its share of these blunders of late. Last week "we" got three items "all balled up" in the rush to get out the paper. The effect was startling -and if the Tribune would have been be lieved the laws of nature would have to suddenly be reversed. It was all caused by transposing a couple of lines of type. J. D. Curry, one of our most respected citizens, has been ill for some time with rheumatism. The Tribune made the startling statement thas as the result of his sickness he had given birth to a twelve pound boy. As a matter of fact, that boy be longed over in the home of Samuel Cox. In the item re lating to the birth of Mr. and Mrs. Cox's twelve pound boy the Tribune said it happened "while the whistle blew." Now, of course, it is possible that whistle was blowing at the time, but we doubt it. That line referring to the whistle blowing should have been un der the item about Rile^ carry ing the dynamite, Am?rtratt £trl us (tatparrii tmtlj Httglislj Gkutsm By E.
