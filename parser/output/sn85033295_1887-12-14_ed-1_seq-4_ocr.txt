Watertown Republican. WATERTOWN. WIS., DEC. 14, 1887. The Message in England Mr. Cleveland’s message is universally popular in England and the British press recognizes it as a free trade document. The London Times says: “Mr.Cleve land’s message will be a damper upon the Fair Traders, or fiscal reformers, who are to meet in London to-morrow night un der Mr. Howard Vincent’s leadership, and to endeavor to gal van-ze into life the policy stillborn at Oxford. It is not when America is doubting w bet her the blessings of protection are not alter all a mockery and a snare that England is likely to fling free trade overboard in a panic.” As The Milwaukee Sentinel well says, “if the British manufacturers could vote at the next presidential election they would be unanimous for Mr. Cleveland.” Ex-Atty -Gen. McCartney, of Kan sas, expressed the opinion that his state would send a delegation to Chicago in structed to vote for Robert T. Lincoln for president. A western paper asks with “ghoulish glee” where it is to look for the wreck and destruction that it was feared would fol low the inter-state commerce act. The answer is easy enough. Destruction and wreck have not followed the act because but little or no part of it has been en forced. The enterprising New York World has interviewed the Republican members of congress as to their presidential prefer ences. “Non-committal” leads the list. “For the nominee of the National Repub lican convention” stands next. The Re publican members of congress, or at least the majority of them, have very sensible views on this question. There issaid to exist in certain Demo cratic quarters a good deal of chagrin at Ihe lack of diversity in President Cleve land’s message. It is thought that the chief magistrate might, at least, have said a word or two on the fisheries question. A careful perusal of the document as it stands creates the disappointing but thor oughly matter-of-fact impression that the reason Grover didn’t write about the other things was that he didn’t know how. The following from The New York Press (Rep.) is the gist of the president’s message boiled down: Upon the whole, the message is a de claration in favor of tariff for revenue only, and as such it must be regarded. If Mr. Cleveland is to be the nominee of the Democratic party in 1888, the pro tection and free-trade issue will be clear ly drawn. His utterances are those of a free-trader, his arguments are in the same line, and to put his proposals into execu tion would destroy American industry, turn our home market over to foreigners, and reduce the compensation of those who labor for a living.

MORE A3Lj. ‘ The Milwaukee Sentinel Ahead. The Chicago dailies circulating in these parts were badly left last week by The Milwaukee Sentinel. Blaine’s Paris in terview on the president’s message was published in full in The Sentinel of Thursday morning, but the readers here of the Chicago dailies did not get the same news until Friday morning, The Sentinel readers thus having twenty-four hours the start or a very important and interesting piece of intelligence. All this came about because the Chicago newspapers go to press from three to four hours earlier than The Sentinel in order to be in time for the fast mail leavimr Chicago at 3A. M. This incident shows one of the advantages The Sentinel has over its Chicago contemporaries. Board of Education. Regular mcctimr of the Board of Education December 7th, 18H7.

The collector looked suspiciously at the child and at her. “Your son, is he under seven, madame?” “He is. monsieur.” “Your son is very large for his age, madame.” “He is, monsieur.” “Your son is altogether too large for his age, madame,” snapped the man, exasperated at the American’s coolness. “Oui, monsieur, that may he,” retorted the mother, calmly. “He is not French, you see.” —Four weeks ago Farmer C.
