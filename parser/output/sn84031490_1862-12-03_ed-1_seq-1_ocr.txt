ISfyt ttwittne* *EDIp!SDA.T, DECEMBER 8, 1863. Tup rKESIBEST’S MESS iGE. "We arc able to lay before our readers us morning the President’s Message, re ,..-cd by special dispatch last evening,’ an- dpaUng by twenty-lour hours its arrival y maih The general tone and scope ot Ie document seem to have been very filially foreshadowed by the synopsis omishcd in our dispatches of Monday ight. Those were such as hy their iromisc to enhance the eagerness for lie Message itself, and now that it is in he hands uf mfilians of readers, it will ■ommend itself to the careful considers-, ion of honest and loyal men, both from he points discussed, to which tins momen ous crisis of our national affairs lends Freight, and by the fairness, candor and loroughness with which the great troths t conveys are put forward. In its high noral tone, in the weight given o moral considerations, questions of duty lat pertains to nations as to individuals', n its statement of doctrines of Human Rights and Justice, the only safe rule of guidance for Governments as for citizens, iiit* document will stand among State pa pers as worthy of the Chief Magistrate of i Christian nation, embarked in a great struggle for the Union against Secession, liberty against Oppression. It is an Amti-Havery paper, hy the same resistless causes that have made this an Anti-Slavery war. It discusses the amelioration of the condition of the hlack race for the sake of ic whites, precisely as this contest for the safety of the latter must elevate the former. The larger share of space among the topics is devoted to he argument for compensated emancipa tion as a humane method of adjustment Without bloodshed and waste of tressure in war. Loyal men who believe this kind ly reasoning will he thrown away upon the rebels will be encouraged at noting that the olive is not advanced before the sword. The war will go on, nor be stayed an instant by this discns tion. If any reader is disappointed ho finding no reference to the Emancipa tion Proclamation - promised as a Kew Year’s present to Human civilization, it is enough to borrow a phrase from the Presi dent himself. He “ will not cross Fox Elver before he gets to Pox Elver.” In ■ ether words* it is not the first of January yet, and Congress has jast now notaing to do with that future, or this Message to them would have referred to it.

Ho reports the Beard of Trade Battery still at Bowling Green, and in good condition. The 19tb Illinois was in Nashville, the SlCli (Rail road regiment) marched through Nashville southward week belore last. The SSth, 51st and 85th Illinois regiments were at Edgefield, on the west side of the Cumberland River, and about two and a half miles Isom Nash ville. The 24th Illinois Is at iUtcheUTille, Tern. All these regiments were in very good • condition, except the SSth, in which there was considerable sickness, but the health of _ the regiment was rapidly improving. Two of its men, named James W. Hamilton and S. T. Armstrong, died week before last in the hos pital. , Capt. Weeks says Eosecrsns’ army had commenced a forward movement just as he was leaving, and the general impression was that a grand movement against the rebels was about to take place. The whole army are much pleased with their commanders, from Eosecrans down. Not a complaining word was heard. TBO3I ST, I/OUIS, [Special IHfpatcli to the CMcas° Tribune. Sr. Louis, Dec. 3,1562. On Monday evening last, two companies of the Ist A WL ~* m * HR cavalry, under the command of Cart. Made, had a fight with a party of rebels 500 strong, at Toknm Creek, In Carroll county, Arkansas. Capt Mack’s command numbered eighty-five of the Ist Arkansas cavalry and fifteen armed citizens, making 100 in alh The engagement lasted about four hours, and resulted in a loss of one killed and £ OUr -mounded ol the Arkansas cavalry, and twenty killed and thirty wounded of the rebde. Capt. Mack had a horee shot from under him, but otherwise escaped unhurt. On the 24th lust.. Major Kelly, with a de tachment of the 4th Missouri State militia, started from Greenfield, Dade county, to scour the head of Horse Creek, a notorious haunt of rebels and bushwhackers. On the evening of the 25th, the detachment came suddenly upon a party of rebels armed to the ] teeth, who showed fight.

Major Kelly, with two of Ids officers, —Capt. Parker and Adjt Kobin eon—boldly charged, and a running fight en sued across the prairie. Before the troops recovered from their surprise and prepared to char-re, the gallant three were far ahead in I pursuit, and when reached by the troops had already captured five prisoners and made the ' notorious Lieut. McMabee and another foe bite the dust. The remainder of the rebel band escaped, their horses being more fresh ■than those of the troops, whose horses were fatigued and worn down by twelve boms hand riding over rough roads.

Halleck’s Report of War Operations, History cf tie Withdrawal from, the Peninsula. Gen. EScClellatfs Protest. RUMORED REMOVAL OF BURNSIDE NOT CONFIRMED. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune J WasniKGTOSt, Dec. ", 185 i, Mothing is known here confirmatory of the report that Gen. Burnside has been relieved of the command of ahe army of the Potomac. The President has sent to the Senate the nominations of Brig. Gens, Sykes and Butler-, field, to he Major Generals, and sixteen Colo nels to ho Brigadier Generals. Gen. Halleck has submitted to Secretary Stanton an exceedingly long report of mili tary operations since the 23d of July, when he took command. He says he visited Mc- Clellan to see whether there was any proba bility of success by that mode of advancing on Richmond, and it not, to form some plan lor uniting Pope’s and McClellan’s armies on tome other line. On arriving at Harrison’s Landing, McClellan told him he must have at least 50,000 additional troops. Halleck re plied that 20,000 was the utmost number that could possibly be found to Send. Gen. Mc- Clellan took one night to consider it, and told Gen. Halleck that he would make the at tempt on Richmond with the 20,000 reinforce ments. With that understanding Halleck re turned to Washington. There he received a disnatch from McClellan, saying that he ccnld not leave without 35,000. It being wholly impossible then to furnish this ania -1 her. ' .tr, Hslleck ordered the -withdrawal oi the army from the Peninsula. McClellan at once forwarded the following protest: BniEur, Va.., August4th, 1862—12 m. (In cypher to 2lf<j. Gen. Halleck, Commander in Chief:) Yocr telegram of last evening is received. I must confess that it has caused me the greatest pn<n I ever experienced, Tor I am convinced that lh<?order to -withdraw the army to Aquia Creek will prove disastrous in the extreme to cur cause. I fear it will he a fatal blow- Several days are necessary to complete the arrangement for so im portant a movement as this, and wirde they are in progress I beg that careful consideration may he given to my statement. This army ia now in ex cellent discipline and condition. We hold a de bouche on both banka of the James River that we are free to act in any direction, ana with the as sistance of the gunhoats I consider our commu nication as now secure. We are now twenty-five miles from Richmond, and are not likely to meet the enemy in force suf ficient to fight a battle until we have reached fif teen or twenty miles nearer, which brings us prac tically within ten milcaof Richmond. Our long est line of land transportation would be from this point twenty-five miles, but with aid of gunhoats we can supply the army by water during its ad vance certainly to within twelve miles of Rich mond. At Aquia Creek wc would be seventy-five miles from Richmond, with land transportation all the way. Prom here to Fort Monroe is a march of about seventy miles, for I regard it as impracti cable to withdraw this army and its material ex cept by land, the result of the movement would be to march 135 miles to reach a point now only twenty-five miles distant, and to deprive our selves entirely of the powerful aids of gunhoats and other transportation, and to these the certain demoralization of the army, which would ensue ihc terrible depressing effect upon the p< ople of the Korth, and the sternprobabiilty that it w'-uld influence foreign powers to recognize pur adversaries. There 'appears to me sufficient rea sons to make it my imperative duty to urge in the strongest terms afforded by out language, that this order may be revoked, and that so far from re* calling this army it bo promptly reinforced to ena ble it to resume the offensive. It may be said there are no reinforcements available. 1 point to Gts. Burnside’s forces, to that of Gen. Pope, not necessary to maintain a strict defense of Wash- Inston and llarpcr’e Ferry; to those positions of the army of the West not required for a strict de fense there. Here, directly in front of the army, is the heart of rebellion- It is here that all our resources should be collected to strike the blow which shall determine the £htc of this nation. All points of secondary importance elsewhere should be aban doned, and every available man brought here. A decided victory here and the military strength of the rebellion would be crushed. It matters not w hat partial reverses wc may meet with else where, here is the true defense of "Washington. It is here on the hank of the James River that the fate of the Union should be decided. Clear in my convictions of right, strong in the consciousness that I have ever been, and still am, actuated solely by love of my country. Knowing that no ambitious or selfish motives Lave influenced me from the commencement of this war, I nyw do what I never did in my life. I entreat that order maybe rescinded. If my counsel docs not prevail I will, with a sad heart, obey your orders to the utmost of my pow er, devoting to tbe movement one of the utmost delicafrand difficulty whatever skill I may pos sess, whatever the result may be; and may God grant that lam mistaken in my forebodings. I shall at least have the internal satisfaction that I have written and spoken frankly, and have sought to do the best in my power to arrest disaster from my country. (Signed) G. B. McJn-KLUAK, slaj. Gen. (Official Copy.) Headquarters Army, Washing ton, D. C., Kov. 25,15G2. To this Hallcck returned the following; Washington, Aug. 6, 1862. Major General McClellan commanding, &c., Berk ley,Ta.: Goaman: Year telegram of yesterday was re ceived this morning and I immediately telegraphed ] a brief reply, promising lo -mite yon more folly by mail. Yon, General, could not hare been more pained at receiving my order than I was at the necessity of issuing it. I -was advised by high officials in whose judgment I had great confidence to make tho order immediately on my arrival here, but 1 determined not to do so until I could learn your wishes from a personal interview, and after tfiat interview I tried every in my power to avoid withdrawing your army, and delayed my decision so long as I dared | •o e clay it. I assure you General it was not a heartless and inconsiderate act hut one that caused me more anxious thought than any other of my life, hut after foil and mature consideration of an the pros and cons. I was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the I order must be issued. Allow me to allude to a few of the facts-of the case. You and your offi cers at our interview estimated the enemy’s forces in and around Richmond at 200,000 men, since then you and others report that they have received and arc receiving large reinforcements from the South. Gen Pope’s army now covering Washington is only 4D.0C0. Your effective force is only about 90,- COP. Ton arc only thirty-five miles from Rich mond, and Gen. Pope, eighty or ninety, with the i nemy directly between yon, ready to fell with his superior numbers upon one or the other, as he may elect. Neither tan reinforce the other in case of such an attack. If Pope’s be destined to reinforce you, Washington, Maryland and Penn sylvania would be left uncovered and exposed. If your force be reduced to strengthen Pope, you i>c too weak lo ever hold the posit ion yon | JPfOCcnpy, should the enemy turn around and | attack you in full force; in other words the old army of the Potomac is split in two parts, with the entire force of the enemy directly between them. They cannot be united by land without exposing both to destruction, and jet they must be united. To scud Pope's forces by water to the Peninsula is under present circum stances a military impossibility. The only alter native is to send the forces on the Peninsula to some point by water—say Fredericksburg—where the two armies can be united. Let me now allude to some of the objections ’ which you have urged. Yon say that to withdraw from the present position will cause the certain demoralization of the army, which is now in ex cellent discipline and condition. I cannot under • stand why a simple change of position to new and by no m™™ distant base will demoralize an army In excellent discipline, unless officers themselves assist in the demoralization, which I am satisfied they will not. Your change of front from your extreme right, at Hanover Court House, to your present poai- | tlon, was over thirty miles. But I have not heard that it demoralized your troops, notwithstanding the severe losses they sustained in effecting it. A new base on the Rappahannock, at Fredericks burg, brings you witMn about sixty miles of Richmond, and secures a reinforcement of 4),000 or 60 COO fresh and disciplined troops. The change, with such advantages will, I think, if i properly presented, to your army, encour -1 age rather demoralize your troops. Moreover, you. yourself suggested that a I junction might be effected at Xoikwwn, bat that a flMl k march across: the Peninsula wonldbemore liazardona than to retire to Tort Monroe. Ton •will remember that Torktown is two o t three miles further from Richmond than. Freder icksburg is. Besides the latter Is between Rlch- mord and Washington and covers Washington from any attack hy the enemy. The political ef fect of the withdrawal may at firet be unfavorable but I think the public ate beginning to understand its necessity and that they will have more confi dence in a united army than the separate frag* ZD CntS. But yon will reply, why not reinforce here, eo that I can strike Richmond from my position. To j do this, yon said at'our interview, that yon requir- 1 cd 50.CG0 additional troops. I told yon It was Impos- I fcihle to give you so many. You finally thought yon would have some chance of success with. 20,000, hut you afterwards telegraphed that you would re quire 55.0G0. as the enemy was being largely rein forced. If your estimate of the enemy’s strength was correct, yonr requisition was perfectly reas onable; hut it was utterly impossible to fill it un til new troops could he enlisted and organized, which would require several weeks. _ . To keep your army in its present position until it could he reinforced, would almost destroy it. In that climate, the months of August and September arc almost filial to whites on that part of the James Eiver, and even after you .got the reinforcements atked for,you admitted that you must reduce Fort Darling and the river batteries before you could advance on Richmond. It is by no means certain that the reduction of the fortifications would not require as much as those at Torktown, this delay might not only he Mai to the health of yom army, hut in the meantime Gen. Pope’e forces would be exposed to the heavy blows of the enemy without the eligheit hope of aSEiel once from you. In regard to the demoralizing effect of a with drawal from the Peninsula to the Rappahannock. I must remark, that a large number of your high est officers; indeed a majority of those whose opinions hare been reported to me, are decidedly in favor of the movement. Even several of those who originally advocated the line of thePenin ecla, now advise its abandonment. 1 have not inquired, and do not desire to know by whose advice, or for what reasons the army of ;he Potomac was separated into two parts, with the enemy between them. I must take things as 1 find them. I find the forces divided, and I wish to unite them. The only feasible plan has been presented for doing this. if you or any one else had presented a bettor cue, I certainly should have adopted It; but all of 1 jour plans require reinforcements, which it la im politic to give you. U is very easy to ask for • dnfcrcimcnts, but It is no; so easy to give them when you have no disposition of .troops at your command. I have written very plainly, as I understand the cate, and I hope you will give me credit for hav ing considered the matter, although 1 may have u.ri\cd at different conclusions from your own. Verv respectfully, your obedient servant, (Signed,) ' H. W. Bmiecj, General-in-Chief. Gen. Hulledi states that about this time lie received news of a heavy rebel force prepar ing to attack Pope, and menace the capital. Be thereupon sent urgent messages to Mc- Clellan, but still the evacuation of Harrison’s Landing Vt as not commenced till eleven days alien Vr'AfJinXGTOX, ll'C. 2,1-G1 Gen. Hdlcek, tie Commandcr-in-Chief, u. Me report to tie Secretary of War, states that he started on the 24th of July to visit the army of the Potomac, to ascertain if there was a possibility of an advance upon Rich mond from Harrison’s Landing, and if not to form some plan of nniting the armies of Gen. Pope and Gen. McClellan, who was of the Opinion that it would require 50,000 additional troops to go on. 3! illcck replied that there could not be sent more than 20,000. Goa. McClellan ashed to consider the matter till morning, when he agreed to go on with that number. On Gen. Haßeck’s arrival home, he received a dispatch that at least 35,000 troops would he requited. The report states that such reinforcements could not be sent without leaving Washing ton and Baltimore almost defenseless, and an order for the withdrawal of the army of the Potomac was issued on August Sd, a previous order having been given for the removal of the tic's, and transports in vast numbers sup plied. A protest was read from Gen. McClel lan on the slb, and the order was not put in force for eleven dsys—until the 14th. On the Ist orders were issued to Gen. Bum side to ernbarh at Newberg for Aquia Creek, who arrived promptly on the night of the 3d. It is added, had the army’ of the Potomac ariivcd a few days earlier, the rebel army could have been easily defeated, and perhaps destroyed. The losses at South Mountain and Antietam arc put at 1,742 killed, s;0S0 wound ed, and 913 missing—a total of 10,721. The report states that the army rested on the north hank of the Potomac, near Sharpshnrg, from the 17in of September to the 27th of Oc tober, and says that the long inactivity of so large an army in ibe face of a defeated foe, and during the season for rapid marches and a vig oroug campaign, was a matter of great disap pointment. A review of the movements before Wash ington is made. He says that a part ol the Army of the Potomac was ordered forward Ircm Alexandria, and that Gen. Cos was or dered to come by rail via Washington from Western Virginia with the main portion of his force. Gen. Pope’s order on the 27th to Gen. Por ter, to he at Bristow Station nest morning, the’report says, for some unexplained reason, Porter did not comply with this order, and and his corps was not in the bsttle of the 27th and 29th, In which Gen. Pope gained some, ground, although the battles were not de cisive. Of the reinforcements from Alexan dria, embracing at length the whole Peninsula army, it is said some of tee corps moved with becoming ac tivity, bntihe delays were neither creditable nor excusble. The [soldiers actually engaged in these battles fongbt wrtb great bravery, but many thousands straggled away from their commands, audit is said not a few voluntarily surrendered to the enemy, so as to be paroled as prisoners of war. In this emergency Cox’s troops were or dered forward in great haste from Western Virginia. Halleck then recites the history of Pope’s campaign; brings out a letter from Pope, in TjUich officer pronounces Sigd as wholly n» reliable. Halleck commends Pope’s earlier disposi tions for isolating Jackson’s forces, as well planned. The delays of some of McClellan’s troops in marching to Pope’s relief were nei ther creditable nor excusable. He says no lull official report of the campaign has yet been received from Pope. He concludes this subject by saying that if McClellan’s troops bad arrived a little earlier the rebel army could have been easily defeated and perhaps destroyed. Halleck next sketches the history oi the Maryland campaign and denounces the sur render of Harper’s Ferry, and implicitly censures McClellan for it. He then complains of McClellan’s long inactivity in the lace of a defeated enemy, and says he was utterly igno rant of what his plan of campaign was, as towards the close McClellan sent no reports to him, but only to the President direct. Halleck next sketches Buell’s campaign, and says that as a commission is ordered to investigate, it wonld be obvlonsly improper ter him to express his opinions now. He says an investigation has been ordered of Morgan’s stiarge abandonment of Cum berland Gap. Grant’s andßOEecrans’ operations are sketch ed without comment. Curtis’ withdrawal to Missouri is termed unfortunate, and is arid to have prevented the carrying out of intended movements in Arkansas. « He says It is quite possible the Indian hos tilities may be resumed in the spring, and preparations will be made accordingly. The forces in South and Horth Carolina are pronounced too small to accomplish much. Gen. Halleck attention to the fact that onr victories have not been followed np, and says fhftl in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky and Middle Tennessee the rebel armies have exhibited much more mobility and action than our own. Be says this is partly owing to our enormous baggage and immense transporta tion, and says that onr troops, especially in the East have been little accustomed to such marching as Is required by active operations. Absenteeism and straggling desertion are spoken of as crying evils, and military laws on this and other subjects are said to need re vision. The 1(11016 report, of which the above is a condensation, is 1,000 words longer thin the Freeidect'eUceeage. 

CHICAGO, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1862. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSASI.

FOREIGN RELATIONS. The correspondence touching foreign affairs i which has taken place during the last year, Is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, made Dy the House of Representatives near the close of the past session of Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at other periods it has certainly been more satisfactory thnri a nation so unhappily distracted as we are. might have reasonably apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which at the beginning of our domestic diffi culties so unwisely and so unsuccessfully as we think, recognized the insurgents as a ■belligerent powers, would soon recede from that position which has proved only less inju rious to themselves than to our own country, but the temporary reverses winch afterwards befel the national anas and which were exag gerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple war which has so radicaUy.chang ed lor the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily dis turbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increaFing|throughout a peri od of half a century. It has at the same rime excited political ambitions and apprehensions winch have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne taking part in any controversy between par tita and factions in any such States. We have attempted no propagandi-m and acknowledg ed no revolution, but we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of it£ own aff-iirs. Our straggle has been of course contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and ibe consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even if it were joat, would certainly be unwise. &LTPHESSION OF THE SLAVE TRADE. The treaty with Great Britain for the sup pression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of especial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution ot it on the part ot Her Majesty’s government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authori ties of the United Slates, and the rights ot their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hmovcr for the abo lition of the State dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that purpose. THE COAST BLOCKADE. A blockade ol 3,000 miles of eea coast could cot be established aud vigorously enforced in a seafon of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mis takes, ond indicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil vtar, occurring in a country where for eigners reside and carry on ft trade under trea ty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of com- I plain* s of the violations of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misappre hensions and possibly to produce national reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so fas 6S possible, heard and redressed complaints •winch have been preferred by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to £agree with the Government whose protection is demanded by the claimants. Tuers arc, moreover, many cases in which the* United States or their citizens sutler wrongs trom ravel or military authorities of foreign nations, which ihe government of these States a: e not prepared to redress. AN 

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION. I have proposed to some of the foreign States thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has Di en made especially to Great Britain, to France, to dpain and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but I has not yet been formally adopted- THE CASE OF A KOBWEGIAK BARE. I deem it my duly to recommend an appro rr'ation in behalf of the owners of the Nor wegian bark Admiral P. Forciena KioJa, which vessel was in May 1601, prevented by the commander of the blockadiog force off Charleston, from leaving that port with a car go, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to an Loglish vessel. I have directed ihc Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be commu nicated to the proper committee. AFRICAN EMIGRATION. Application have been made to me by many ‘ free Americans ol African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such coloni ruiion as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Ollier putties, at borne and abroad, come from. interested motives, others upon pairiotic principles, and still others influenced bs philanthropic sentiments, have suggested similar measures; while on the other hand several o: the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Cnder these circumstances I have declined i to move any such colony to any State without iirst obtaining the consent of its Government, | with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all their rights as iretmen, and I have, at the same time, offered to the several States situated in the tropics, or having colonies there to negotiate with them, subject to the and consent of the Sen- I ate, to favor the voluntary emigration of por -1 lions of that class to their respective Tcrrito- I riea, upon conditions which shall be e^ual, just and humane. I Liberia and Hajtl are yet the only countries J to which colonists of African descent from 1 here could go witha certainty of being received 1 and adopted as citizens, and I regret to jay | that such persona, contemplating colonizt -1 lion, do not seem so willing to emigrate to I these countries as to some others, nor so wu • 1 ling as I think their interest demands. I be ’ I lieve, however, that the opinion is improving, ’ and that, ere long, there will be an augmented i 1 and considerable emigration to both these [ I countries from the United btales. l 1 OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. The new commercial treaty between the United Slates and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, sub ject to the Senate’s consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation Is now pending with the Republic of Hayti. A considerable improve ment of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States, remain undisturbed. I Very favorable relations also continue to be I maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan. otm sEionßonisG satioss. During the last year there has not only hecn no charge of our previous relations with the Independent States of onr Continent but more friendly sentiments than have been heretofore existing are believed to be enter tained by those neighbors whose safety and progress are so Intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Costa Bica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Fern and Chili. The commission under the convention with the Republic of New Granada 1 closed Us session without having audited and I passed upon all the claims which were sub mitted to it.

The commission between the United States and the Republic of 1 Costa Rica has completed its labors and sub j mitted its report. INTERNATIONAL telegraph. I have favored the project of connecting the United Stales with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco to connect by a Padhc telegraph wire with the wire that id being extended across the Russian empire, ora TERBITOmES. . «Xhc Territories ot the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained un disturbed by the civil war, and they are ex hibiting such evidence of prosperity as justi fies an expectation that' some of them will coon be In a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union. * . The immense mineral resources ot some of these Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direc tion would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the Government and diminish the burdens ot the people. A SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION’. It Is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to pro mote that end cannot he adopted. The meas ure which suggests itself as most likely to be effective Is a scientific exploration of the min eral regions in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries —results which cannot tail to be auspicious. NATIONAL FINANCES. The condition of the finances trill claim vour most diligent consideration. The vast expenditures incidental to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a unznpUtade and certainty unusual in simi lar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. THE CURRENCY INFLATION. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made notary by the augmented forces now la the field, as- m* matid your best reflection as to the best mege of providing the necessary revenue wichoatlbjn iy to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor. The suspension ©t ape* cie payment by the banks, soon after the.com* mencementot your last session, made Urge issues of United Stales notea unavoidable, iu no other way could the payment of the troops and other lust demands be so economically or SB well provided for. The judicious legis lation of Congress seeming the recaivgimy of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at feast and fot>the time, the long-felt want of a uniform emula ting medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discount and return to specie payments, however, the earliest period compatible, with a dußriee ß ®* to all interests, should be kept in view,. EVILS OF FLUCTUATION. Fluctuations In the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctua tions to the lowest possible point, wul always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Prompt and certain convertibility into com is generally acknowledged to be the best and Burest against them, audit is extremelYdonbt fnl whether a circulation’ of United^- States notes, payable in coin, and sufficiently large for the wants of the people, can be perma nently, usefully and safely maintained. Is there any other medium which the necessary provision for the public wants can be-made, ind the great advantages of asafe and uniform currency secured V A REMEDY PROPOSED. I know of none which promises so certain results, and at the same time so unobjection able as the organization of banking associa tions under a general act of Congress well guarded in its provisions. To tions the government might furnish clrculat- , ing notes on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes prepared under the supervision of prqjfcr oUl cers being uniform in appearance, and secu rity and convertible always with coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a I viscious currency, and facilitate commerce by I cbtap and safe exchanges. A moderate roser [ vnMon from the interest on the bonds would I compensate the United States for the prepara tion and distribution of the notes, and a gen ! eral supervision ot the system, would lighten the burden of that part ot the public debt 1 employed as security. The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new.loms greatly facilita ted by the steady market demand for govern ment bonds, which the the pro- I posed syfetem would create. It is .an addi tional recommendation of the measure,of con- I siderable weight in my judgment* that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all exlst -1 inginterests by the opportunity offered to ex isting institutions for a secured uniform na- I t’onal circulation in place of the local and va rious circulation, secured and unsecured, now 1 ueutdby them. * THE TREASURY EXHIBIT.

WAR AND NATT REPORTS. The reports of the the Navy and “WaTr are herewith transmitted. These reports, tbouch lengthy, are scarcely more than brief extracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations con ducted through these departments, nor could I give a summary of them here upon any prin ciple which would admit of its being much shorter than 7 lie reports themselves. _ 1 therefore content uijseU with laying the reports before you, and asking your attention to them. _ m THE POST OFTICE DEPARTMENT. It gives me pleasure to report adecided un ?rovemeut in 100 financial condition of the 1 ost Office Department as compared with, the several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year 18C1 amounted to OS.diOjlpu.tO, rrhich embraced the revenue from all States ol the Union for three-quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called Confederate States during the last fiscal year the increase of the corres pondence of the loyal States has been suth cicnt to produce a revenue during tire same year otsß,‘-09,5-0.80, being only SoO.OOO less than was derived from all tie States of the Union the previous year. The expenditures shew a still more iavora ble result. The amount expended in IS6I wasSl3iCO6,7S9.ll. For the last year the amon* has been reduced to 18, shewing a difference of about in the expenditures, as compared with the pre ceding year, or about $3,750,000, as compared with the* fiscal year of ISOO. ~ The deficiency in the department for the previous year was si,sol,9CG.pS. For the last fiscal it was reduced to S-,li-,bU.07. Tese favorable results are, in fact, owing to the cee&lion of mail conveyance in the insur rectional’States, and in part to a casual re view of all. expenditures in that department, in. the interest ot economy. EFFICIENCY—POSTAL COXTEKTION - , The efficiency of .the postal- service it is be lieved has also been much improved. The Postmaster General also opened a correspon dence, through the Department ot State, with Foreign Governments, proposing a Conven- , tlon of postal representatives, for the purpose ol simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foicign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interest of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to buy ail the Governments from whom replies have been received. X asfc the attentionof, Congress to the suggestion of the Postmaster General in his report respecting the further legislation required m his opinion for the benefit of the postal service. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. The Secretaiy of the Interior reports as fol lows in regard to public lands: The nubile lands have ceased to be a sopree of revenue. From the Ist of July, 1661, to the 3toh of September, 186*2, the entire cash receipts from ton talcs of public lands were $187,477 26—a sum much less tb&n the expenses of ©or land system during li law. which wJU take effect on the Ist of January next, offers such mdaceroenta to seti lets that sales for cash cannot he expected to “SSMSSS SSf&VKSSi the sums here stated as arising from the sales of public lauds and the gums derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises asl understand,'from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently,, were not really coincident at the beginning point.

I enbmit a statement of the proceedings of the commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise oi con structing the Pacific Railroad and thus ang- - guests the earliest completion of the road, end also the favorable action of Congress up on the project now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois; as being of vital and rapidly, increasing.importance to the; whole • nation, and especially to the vast interior re >ion hereinafter to he noticed at some greater engtb. 1- propose having prepared and laid beiore yon at an early day some interesting and val uable statistical information upouthis subject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Blinds and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River, is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secreta ry of War, and how transmitted to Congress. I respectfnUy-ask your attention to It. THE AGRICULTURAL BUREAU. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May lost, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to he organized. The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system ol correspondence and ex changes both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture in the in troduction of new products, and iu the col lection of agricultural statistics of the differ ent States; also, that it will soon be prepared ■to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants and cuttings, and has already published and liber ally diffused much valuable information. In anticipation of a mors elaborate report which in due time will be published, em bracing some valuable tests in chemical sci ence now in urogress in the laboratory, the creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and X trust that the liberal basis upon which it has beeij organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most smsu’ne friends, and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people. the proclamation or shut. S2d. On the 22d day of September last a procla- i tion was issued by the Executive—a copy of which is herewith submitted. In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second par agraph of that paper I now respectfully recall jour attention to what may be^ called com pensated emancipation. A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of certain durability. •» One generation paseeth away and another generation cometh, but the earth abideih tor ever.” it is of the Aral importance to duly consider and esti mate this ever enduring part. TUB UNION ONE AND INSEPARABLE. That portion of the earth’s surface which is owned and inhabited by the people ot the United States is well adapted to the home of one national family. It is not well adapted for two oi more.. Its vast extent, and its variety ol climate and productions are of advantage in the age of one people,Jwhateveithey might have been in former ages. Steam, and tele graphs and intelligence, hSve brought these to be on advantageous combination lor one united people. THE POLLY OF DISUNION. In the Inaugueral Address I briefly pointed out the total Inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for difficulties between the of the two sections, X did so in language which I cannot improve and which, therefore, I beg to repeat. THE MATTER IN A NUTSHELL. One section of our country believe slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it to be wrong and ought • not to be extended. This is the oniy substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Con stitution and the law, for the suppression of the African| slave trade, are each as woU_ en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the peo ple imperfectly support the law itself. The great body of'the people abide by tin? legal obligations in both cases and a few break over each. This I think cannot be perfectly cured and it would be worse iu both instances after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly sup pressed, weald be, ultimately, revieved with out restriction in one section, while fugitives row only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all to the other, TUB PHYSICAL ARGUMENT AGAINST DISUNION. ■physically speaking, we cannot separate, we cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. Ahusband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyondthe reach of each other, but the dlffor entparts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face, and inter course either amicable or hostile must cou- Ihme between them. Is it possible then to maKc that intercourse more advantageous or move f atisfUctory after separation than before. Cayi aliens make treaties ead-.r than founds can make laws? Can treaties be more faith fully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends. Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always, and when after much loss on bMh sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. There Is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide. Trace through from East to West, upon the line bftween the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one-third of Us length are rivers easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to bs populated thickly, upon both sides, while in nearly all Us re maining length are mcrelylsutveyors’ lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence. No part of this line can be made anymore difficult to pass by writing it down oa papci, or parchment, as a : national boundary. WHAT SECESSION SURUENDBB3. ' 152.2U3.77 .. ... 257,005-50 .583,885,347.65 • The fact of separation If it comes, gives up on the part of.tLe;seceding section, the fugi tive slave clause, along with all other consti tutional obligations, upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipu lation would ever be made to take its place. ** the great body of tbe republic.** But there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east by the Allegan- Dies, north by tbe British Dominions, west by ibe Kooky Mountains, and south by tne line along which tbe cultivation of corn and cot ton meets, and which includes part of \ ir pifcja, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Mis souri. Kansas, lowa, Minnesota, and the ter ritories of Dacotah, Nebraska and a part of Colorado have above ten millions of people, and will haye fifty millions within fifty years if not prevented by any political tolly or mistake. It contains more than one tuird of | ihe country owned by the revolted States— certainly, more than one million of surface mile?, one-half as populous as Massachusetts already is. It would have more than seventy five millions of people. A glance at the map chows that territorially speaking it is the grea i lod« of the RepiHUc. The other parts are but marginal horoers to it. The magnificent, _te cion sloping west from, the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being-the deepest and also the richest undeveloped resources m the produc tion of provisions, grains, grasses, and ail which proceeds from them. A GREAT INTERIOR REGION. This great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world, ascer tain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also thelarge and rapidly increasing amount of ite products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented. And yet this region has no sea coast and touches no ocean any where. Ab part of one nation, it§ people now may find and may forever find their way to Europe by New York, to South. America aad ACnca by New Orleans, and -to Asia by San Francis co. Bat separate onr common country into nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every Tllnn in this great interior region is thereby cut oft horn aome one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by embarrass me and onerous trade regulations, and this is tiue wherever a di-riding or boundary line may be fixed. Place ic between the now ftee and slave country, or place it south ot Kentucky, or north ot Ohio, and still the j truth remains tbat none south of it can trade tetany port or place north, of It, and none Eorth oiltcan trade to any port or place south ot it, except upon terms dictated by a Govern ment foreign to them. These outlets East, "West, and South, arc indispensable to the well-being; of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit this vast interior region. - Which of the three may bo the best is no proper question. All are better than eitti®r, and all of right belong to that people and meix successors forever. True to themselves, they viiil not ask where a line’ of separation shall be, but will vow rather, that there shall be no such line. Wor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world.

JL COMMON UTIBBEST, OP SLAVES FREED BT TKB WAB. THE ARGUMENTS THEREFOR, I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed, articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion should never have existed; without slavery it could not continue. Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment and policy iu regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some woatd abolish. it suddenly and -without compensa tion, and some would abolish it gradually and with compensation.' Some would remove the free people from us, and some would re tain them with ns, and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversi ties we waste much strength in struggles amongst ourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize and act together, _ This would be a compromise among the friencs and not with enemies ol* the Union. These arti cles are intended to* embody a plan of such mutual concession. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of the Strt.es. HARMONIZING DIFFERENCES. In the first article the main points are: First, The emancipation. Second, The length ot time for consummating, in years; and Third, Tne compensation. The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the length of time should greatlymitigate their dissatisfaction. The time saves both races Irom the evils of sudden derangement, while most of those whose habitual course ot thought will be disturbed by the measure* wld have passed away before its consummation. They will nevar see it Another class will bail the prospect of emancipation, but will deprecate the length of time. They will feel that it goes for little to the now living slaves, but it really wives them much. It saves them from the va grant destitution which must largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where the circumstances are very great, and it gives the inspiriting assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each State choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now or at the end ot the century, or at any inter mediate time, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part ot that period; and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also provides tor compen sation, and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor perpet ual slavery, especially those who are to re ceive compensation. WHY COMPENSATE. Doubtless some of those who # are to pay and not to receive will object to it : That the measure is both just and economical is cer tain. The liberation of the slaves is the de struction of property acquired by descent or by purchase, tire same as any other property. Ii is no lees true for baling been olten said, that the people of the South are no more re sponsible for the introduction of this property than are the people of the North; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite sale to eaj that the South has been more responsible than the North for its continuance. It, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrificed, is it not jnsfc that it be done at a common chanie ? And if with less money, or money mere ta v ily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means, than we can by the war alone, is it not economical to dolt? AN ECONOMICAL VIEW. Let us consider it then; let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since com pensated emancipation was proposed last >faich, and conticier whether, if that meas ure had been promptly accepted by even some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so, the measure would save money * and in that view, would be a prudent and economical measure, certainly. It is uot so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay a large sum than a larger one. The aggregate sum necessary for compensa ted emancipation of course would be large, but it would require uo ready cash nor bonds any faster than the emancipation progresses. SHAKING THE BURDEN WITH POSTERITY. # Tins might not and probably would not dose before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have 100,000,- OCO people to share the burden instead ox 31,000,000 as now, and not only so, bat the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after the period as rapidl* as before, because onr territories will not have become full I do not state this inconsiderately. At the. same ratio of increase which we have maintained on an average from our first national census in I<W until ISCO, we should in 1900 have a popula tion of 103.505.415, and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period. OUR TERRITORY. Out abundant room, our broad national tomestead, is an ample resource- Were oar territories limited as arc the British isles, i certainly our population could not expand as slated. Instead of receiving tie foreign bora as now, we should be compelled to send pare of the native bom away, but such is not our condition. We have 2,963,000 ot square miles. Europe has 3,509,000 square miles, with a pop ulation. averaging 73Xpersons to the square mile. Why may nos country at some lime average as many ? Is It less fertile ? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts and other causes - Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage? prospective growth of fopuxatiox. If then we are at some time to be as popu lous as Europe, how soon? As to when this may be, we may judge of the past and preseat ss to when, it will ever depend, much on whether wo maintain the Union, beveral of our S'ates are above the average of European population, of 73K to the square mile. Mas sachusetts has 157, Rhode Is.and 133, New York and New Jersey each SO, also two other ureat States, Pennsylvania and Ohio are not far below, the former having 63 and the latter 59. The States direct above the European average, except New York have increased iu as rapid a ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some other parts of oar country in natural capacity lor sustaining a dense popmauon. Takir-e the ratio in the aggregate we find ita population and ratio of increase for the Sev ern decimal periods as follows; nines or mcneasß.

CO-100 per cent in population through the seventy years from our first to our laet census l *ltfc seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is either two per cent below or two per cent, above the aver age. Thus showing how inflesshie; and conse quently how reliaple the law ot mcnasem onr case is. Assuming tltat it will continue, it gives the following results: BATIOS rn-nnrrrr) FOBWARB.^ v '« Population.

In a word, it shows that a dollar «i£ be mwcA harder to patj for the war, than a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan, and then the latter Trill coatno blood, no precious life. It will be 4 saving oi both. OP THE SEIURK OF FUGITIVES. As to the second article I think It wouldbe impracticable to return to bondage the class ol persons therein contemplated. Borne of them doubtless in the property sense belong to loyal owners and hence provision is made in this article for compensating such. T7TE FUTURE OP TUB FREBOMEX. third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige but merely authorizes Congress to rid in colonizing such as may consent.* This'ought' not to be re garded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other inasmuch as it conies to nought unless by mutual consent of the people to -be deported and the American voters through their representatives in Congress. ttib PRESIDENT FAVORS COLO>IZATTOV. I cannot make it better known than it al ready is, that I strongly favor colonization, and yet I wish to say that there is an objec tion asrinst the colored persons remaining in the'eountry, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. It is insisted that their piesence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers —if there ever could be a proper time for mere arguments that time surely is not now. In limes like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsi ble through time and eternity. A HOI AXE 

VIEW. is it true, then , that the colored people cart dis place any more white labor by being free than by remaining slave? If they tray ia their own places, tney jostle no white laborers. If they leave iheir old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neither mere or less of it. EMANCIPATION "WOULD ENHANCE WHITE LABOR Emancipation, even, without deportation, would probably enhance the wsges of white labor, and, verv snrely, would not reduce them. Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed. The freed people would, surely, not do more than their old proportion of tc, and, very probably, for a time, would do less; leaving an increased part to white laborers —bringing their labor into greater demand, and, consequently, enhancing the value of it. With deportation, even to a limited extern, enhancing wages to white la l bor is mathematically certain. Labor is like I anv other commodity In the market. Increase the demand for it, and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor by colo nizing the black laborer out of the country, and, by precisely so much, you will increase the demand for wages for white labor. A BCGBEAR EXPOSED. But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land. "Will liberation mate them any more numerous ? Equally distributed among the whites of the whole county and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one in any way greatly disturb the savenV There are many communities now haring more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without any apparently consciousness of evil from it. TheDistric - of Columbia and the Slates of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition. The District has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in Us i frequent petitions to Congress, I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. WHY SHOULD THEY GO SOUTH, put why should emancipation in. the South send the freed people Norih? People of auy color seldom, run, unless there is souictoiug to iun from. Heretoiore colored people iuve lied North, to some extent, from bondage, and now perhaps from both bondage and des titution ; but if gradual emancipation and de portation be adopted, they will have neither to ilec from. Their own masters will give them Wiiges, at least till new laborers can be procured, and the freed men in turn will gladly give their labor for wages, till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes, and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved, and, in any event, cannot the North decide for itseli whether to receive them. Aualn as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been auy irruption northward because of the abolishment 0- elav»-rv in the District of Columbia last spring ? "What I have said of the proportion cf free colored persons to the whites in the District of Columbia is from, the census of JStiO, having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here. THE "WAR ffllL WAIT FOR NOTHING. The Plan consisting of these articles is re* comnifeiided,noti hut that a restoration of the national authority wonldbe accepted without its adoption, nor will the war or proceedings neder the proclamation of September 22d, !So2,be stayed because of the recommenda tion of this plan. Its timely adoption X doubt not would bring restoration, and thereby stay both, and notwithstanding this plan. The recommendation that Congress pro vides by low tor compensating any State which may adopt the emancipation act before this plan shall have been acted npon,is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would only be an advance part of the plan and the same argu ments apply to both. This plan is recom mended as a means not In conclusion of, but additional to all others for restoring and pre serving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily than can be done by force alone, while it would cost less considering amounts and man ner of payment and times of payment, and the amounts would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force. It is most likely that it would , cost no blood at all. ~ , The plan is proposed as permanent consti tutional law. It cannot become such without ■ the concurrence, first, of twcKlurds of Con-1 f-reas, and afterwards three-fourths of the States. The requisite three-quarters of the 1 States will necessarily include seven of the slave States. It obtained, it will .’give assur ances cf Their severally adopting emancipation sc no distant day, on the new constitutional terms. Ibis assurance would end the strug gle now, and save the Union forever. ~ I do not forget the gravity of a paper ad eressed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate ol the nation, nor do I for get, that some few are my seniors, or that many of yon have more experience than I in. ihe coaduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that in view of the great respon sibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves laanynudae earnestnees I may seem to display. Is it doubted then that the plan I propose, it adopted, will shorten the war, and thus lessen Us expenditure of money and blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the na tional prosperity and perpetuate both indefi nitely? „ , Is it doubted that if we here. Congress and Executive, can secure its adoption, the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal UOQiUS? Can we, can they by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It to not can any of ns imagine better, but j etlU the question recurs, can we do better? The dogmas of the quiet past are Inade quate to tne stormy present Tffic occasion Is j piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As onr case is new, so we must t hinh and act anew; we must disenthral ourselves, and then we shall save our country. ~ , Fdlow-cilbtns: We cannot escape history. We of this Congress will be remembered In spite of ourselves. So personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another ot us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dis honor to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that while we say this, that we know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save. »8, even we, hold the power and bear the responsl- freedom, to the slave insure freedom to the free. Honorable alike m what we give and what we preserve, we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of the ea Qther means may succeed, this could not fan. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, lust, a way which, if followed, the world will applaud, and God must forever bless. fSloned.l Ann a it ah LrxCQLR. "WASHrsGTOK - , Dec. 1,1862.
