BART CAMPRFI I .1 Washington, Dee. . (I. N. S.) With President-elect Warren O. Harding In the comparative seclusion of Mnrlon Ohio, and President Woodrow Wilson's annua message tucked away In the. Congressional Record, congress settled down to business today. Members of the senate and house be inn io uucaie to me tasK nerore them Miring me next three months. An effort was to be made In the sen ate today by Senator Kenvon. rennhll can, of Iowa, to secure fmmetlintA na tion on the so-called packers regula tion measure of which, he and Senator Kendrlck, democrat, of Wyoming, are joint authors. The measure is on the senate calendar as unfinished business ana nas the right of way. Kenyon said he proposed to urge the passage of the bill In a lengthy speech, but opposition to It on the nnrt of sev eral Influential leaders may preclude n eany vote on it. It Is understood Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, and Senator Smoot, of man, are two republican leaders who urueve tne retailer and not the whole naler, Is the one In most need of regu latlon. Certain recommendations made by tie presiueni in nis message are certain to be Ignored bv the rennhlican ma lor. tty in control of congress, republican and democratic' senators declared.

The licensing of corporations engaged in interstate commerce: a loan to Ar menia, and the granting of Indepen dence to the Philippines are other pro posals of the president, which. It Is be lieved will not be acted upon favorably. The coalition between democratic nhrt republican agricultural members may lesuii in in re-establishment of the war finance corporation, despite the op position to this by certain republican leaders.
