New Mexico Demands State Ueod of the 57th Congress. Of Right and In Justice Sew Mexico Should Bo a State. Western dining cars are soon to be supplied with pretty girl waiters. And thus westward the star of empire takes its way. Silver has touched the lowest quota tion in three years, but it still is worth over 54 cents per ounce, sufficient to make it profitable to work all good sil ver mines. It is very plain that the more a man howls reform in New Mexico, the more does he want to get on the official pay, roll; county, territorial ' or federal, it matters not. There is considerable difference be tween the Greeks and the people of Chicago. The Greeks do not want the Bible translated into modern Greek, but the Chicago people will take any translation. Three thousand bills were introduced in the house pn the first day of its ses sion. It looks now already as if all but the most important measures have been snowed under unless powerful in fluence resurrects them. If the 57th congress does not know what it is going to do, the New Mexi can advises some of its leaders to read some of the New Mexico yellow sheets wherein they will find their course of legislation fully marked out. Denmark declares that it is willing to sell the Danish West Indies for a sum ranging between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000, but somehow Uncle Sam is not so anxious nor in as great a hurry to buy the Islands as the Danes think he ought to be. It is probable that the omission of any reference to statehood for the ter ritories of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arizona, in the president's message to congress was a gentle hint to the many nf the three territories not to indulge in so many political fights and broils. It is now discovered that the gentle Filipino, Emilio Aguinaldo by name, although he has taken the oath of alle giance to the United States, is engag ing in treasonable practice and giving aid and comfort to the insurgents wherever he can. The average Filipino will not change much for the better within a decade or two. Quite a number of the bills intro duced in congress thus far are old tim ers, which have been introduced re peatedly in former sessions but failed to run the gauntlet. There is nothing like keeping at it, and like the New Mexico statehood bill, some of those old measures are bound to pass sooner or later. The western representatives in con gress have at last discovered what they should do to secure needed legis lation for this part of the country. They have gotten together and as a unit will demand recognition for the west and there is no doubt, as long as they make common cause, that they will get it. The campaign of 1902 in New Mexico will be one of education. There will be many new voters in the territory for the 1902 campaign and these thousands of new voters can only be reached by the newspapers. Here is a hint that can be taken by anyone who wants to take it. The politician and would-be candidate for office, who does not take it will be the loser. The secretary of the treasury esti mates that it will take $600,000,000, or something like $8 for each man, woman and child in the United States, to run the country during the next fiscal year. Mighty big country this judging not only by Its expenses but also by Its in come for even expenditures of $600,000, 000 a year will leave a handsome sur plus when the acounts are closed. Although but sixty-five per cent of the territorial taxes actually reached the territorial treasury during the fiscal year all interest coupons were prompt ly paid and all expenditures authorized by law were met with one or two un important and small exceptions. This shows up pretty well for the territorial administration and is a fact that lies and fakes made by the opponents of the administration cannot undo. Mayor-elect Seth Low of New York City, judging from newspaper com ments, will likely make the mistake of being too independent. This looks bad for the reform of New York City gov ernment. " Neither Mayor-elect Low nor any other man who has been elected or received office by the efforts of his friends can afford such a stand. That sort of a chicken always comes home to roost. The charges filed against Governor Otero by the New Mexico soreheads have been investigated by the Wash ' Ington authorities and as was asserted by the New Mexican right along were found to be utterly groundless. The Washington authorities If they had not sized up the New Mexico soreheads be fore this certainly have done so by this time. It may be presumed that the bill for an enabling act for New Mexico intro duced by Mr. Rodey on yesterday in the house of representatives contains all needed provisions and is all right. No comment on the same can well be made until a copy of the bill has been received and examined. The "conscience fund" of the treas ury, recently received a contribution of $18,000. It is a cabbage to a thousand dollar bill that this contribution did not come from any member of the so called Republican Reform League of New Mexico. The reichstag, or the German con gress, convened on the same day as the United States congress. The ses sions of the reichstag, however, will bo much stormier than those of con gress for there are almost a dozen par ties in the reichstag against three in congress. The reichstag makes laws for something like 60,000,000 people and it too will be asked to appropriate about $60O,OGv,0CO for the next fiscal year. Rev. F. Wr. Oakes, proprietor of a home for consumptives at Denver, Col orado, is in New Mexico to look up a site in this territory for a similar in stitution. Even Colorado people now, recognize that if Colorado climate is good for the cure of consumption, New Mexico climate Is even better, and that; New Mexico is the natural sanitarium j of the world, and the New Mexican may add, Santa Fe is the sanitarium of New Mexico. The fact that President Roosevelt does not refer to statehood in his mes sage, gives rise to the hope that he may send in a special message to con gress on the subject. It is known that the president believes in statehood for the territories, and he may want to give his faith stronger expression by a separate message on the subject upon which congress would be more certain to act than upon a mere suggestion In the lengthy message sent in yesterday. One of the best methods to undo the injury done the country by trusts is to compel, by law, in the several states and territories, the annual or semi-annual publication of their business transactions in the form of a sworn statement. If there is one thing trusts dread more than another it is publicity of their doings. The Republican party must handle the trust subject without gloves and that in a most vigorous and effective manner. There is plenty of time to do that before the presidential campaign in 1904. The New Mexican's information Is to the effect that it is not practical that the through line of the Rock Island, Chicago & Pacific railroad will be com pleted until January 15 next; but even that is early enough. Many new set tlers are already in the country through which this road will run and many more are healed that way. Eastern New Mexico will in the year 1902 in crease greatly In population. It is a sparsely developed section with many possibilities and will in a few years be a very important and populous part of New Mexico. F. B. Koen has built a dam near Great Bend, Kansas, which brings the underflow of that section to the sur face. He. utilizes a natural reservoir site and at the expenditure of $200,000 will secure sufficient water to irrigate 100,000 acres. There is no reason In the world why the underflow of water in the Rio Grande, Santa Fe and other river valleys in New Mexico might not be utilized in a similar manner. If land that is arid is worth $1 an acre, land under ditch is worth at least ten times as much and it certainly would be a profitable investment therefore to spend $200,000 to reclaim 100,000 acres. There still are a few railroads in this country not gobbled up by the great railroad trust, but these feel so lone some that they are looking aDoui co form combinations of their own. The latest to do thfs are the Pierce and the stillwell lines in the southwest. As President Roosevelt says in his mes sage, the conmbination of capital and of interests, or the so-called trusts, are not necessarily an evil, in fact, they .,ia Tinned States commercial su premacy in the world, but they must be carefully sunpervised by the legal authorities so that the interests oi ia public and of- the commonwealth are conserved. At this date it is impossi ble, without ruining the commercial and industrial interests of the nation, to prohibit the combining or capital and of property, but it is possible and practical to compel sucn coramnauuiw to be in accordance with only the soun dest business principle and to give their affairs such publicity tnat iney will not dare to overreach themselves. Confirmed Land Grants in the 1st District Must Be Assessed. Tn another column of this issue ap pears a letter signed by jjisinci ai- tnrnev E. C. Abbott, addressed to ine county collectors, assessors and boards of county commissioners of the coun ties of the first judicial district, inis communication advises these officials that monv Innri crrants in the three counties of Santa Fe. Taos and Kio Arrlha. that have been confirmed by the United States court of private land .iiimi onri thA Hiirvev of whicn nas been approved have heretofore escaped just taxation. The district attorney proposes to furnish these officials with a list of these grants and will insist that hereafter they be properly assess ed nnd taxes collected from them as the law requires. Mr. Abbott proposes to do his duty, fairly, earnestly and en ergetically and he will leave the rest take care of itself. That is the kind of a district attorney that is needed and there can be no doubt, but that his ac tion will be approved and upheld by good citizens generally; although tax dodging land grant owners may curse and abuse him behind his back. It is believed with the proper assessment, confirmed and surveyed land grants in the three counties named will add at least $2,000,000 to the assessed valua tion of these counties. The district at torney proposes to do his full duty in' this matter and will invoke the law in all cases were dereliction of duty and incapacity characterize the action off county officials in the assessment or non-assessment of land grants In his district.

SWIFT SPECIFIC CO., ATLANTA, OA. ADYERTlSlHGjTHE TERRITORY. The Work Is Being Well Done by the Bureau of Immigration . Roswell Register. The Territorial Board of Immigra tion has issued small booklets adver tising the resources and attractions of a number of the counties in the terri tory. These booklets have been com piled and printed under the supervision of Colonel Max. Frost, secretary of the bureau, and sample copies of the San Juan, Santa Fe and Chaves county booklets, which have been sent the Register, show that the work has been well done. These booklets will accom plish an immense amount of good, as they give information that is con stantly being sought for by hundreds of persons who think of coming to the territory and write letters asking so many ciuestions that it is difficult for a business man to find time to answer them, while it Is an easy matter to put a booklet in an envelope and mail it and thus answer most of the questions asked. The Register is inclined to think that the bureau of immigration can make an excellent use of any funds It may have to spare, in printing a generous supply of such booklets for each county and having them carefully distributed by the railroad companies and supplying the business men of each county with a limited number for judicious use In answering inquiries about their respective localities. The Chaves county issue comprises 10,000 copies of which 6,000 will be distributed by Mr. Don A. Sweet, traffic manager of the Pecos system through the agents of the Santa Fe company. Several thousand are to be sent by the bureau to the Charleston exposition this year and it is intended to issue another edi tion for distribution at the St. Louis exposition in 1803. 4 YELLOW SCHEME. The Truth About That Eepnblican Ee form Leaeue Petition, Las Vegas Record. Some able-bodied romancer has been telling the San Marcial Bee that a peti tion asking President Roosevelt to ap point Fritz Muller of Santa Fe, gover nor of New Mexico, obtained 1,000 sig natures at Las Vegas. That statement is a self-evident falsehood, because there are not 1.000. nor 500, yellow Dem ocrats in San Miguel county. Such a petition was sneaking around the city for a day or two last week, and the most signficant fact connected with it was that it did not contain the names of half a dozen men who obtain gener al recognition as Republicans. Aside from the editors of the yellow sheets and their satellites, nearly all .the names w.ere filched from the tombs out of the cemeteries. The better element of Democrats would not touch the thing any more than Republicans, not be cause they do not esteem Muller as a worthy gentleman, but because the movement had its origin with the yel low sheets and their sorehead allies, who are as great a curse to New Mex ico as the plague of lice was to an cient Egypt. And then, the decent, honorable people of the territory, re gardless of political affiliations, are well satisfied with Governor Otero and his creditable record as governor ot , New Mexico, so much so that his re appointment will meet their cordial ap probation. Governor Otero's Action Commended. Tierra Amarllla Republican. The action of Governor Otero in call ing attention of assessors, collectors and county commissioners to the faulty assessments and the collection of taxes which has been going on for years and years, is certainly correct and timely. The sue-irestion of the governor that the officials interested meet with the board of equalization next January for consultation and to devise ways and means for the betterment of assess ments and tax collections, is a good move also, and we trust every assessor in every county in New Mexico will at tend this meeting at Santa Fe. Poor assessments, no collections and : tax dodgers Is what has kept Rio Arriba county in a back seat for bo many years. If we- have laws let us live up to them or else have none at all.

But the Capital gives no facts or figures as to where the fraud lies, nor does it make any specific charges against Governor Otero. Its whole cry is ring, mismanagement, fraud, and blood and thunder general ly. While claiming that Governor Otero is not a fit man for the office of gov ernor of this territory, the Capital does not tell who is the man. Now most of the citizens of New Mexico seem to be pretty well satisfied with our present executive and it seems like foolishness for the Capital to keep up its contin ual howl, even if no one outside of the territory ever sees that paper. Cowards Are All Alike. Las Vegas Record. The man who stole $70,000' from the Order of the Maccabees says a woman tempted him to do it. Chicago Record Herald. He must be related to the manipula tors of the Las Vegas yellow sheets. When caught In their meanness the latter said a woman tempted them to villainously defame the Spanish-American citizens of the territory. Our es teemed yellow contemporary ought to import the Port Huron man, and then it would own a team of them, which it could drive tandem, or otherwise, to mef.l: is intellectual carrion require- A
