DECEMBER 8, 1916 WILSON TAKES HAND 111 PROBE OF PRICES PHKSIDKNT WILL. It Kg I EST AC TION BY CONGRESS IF CON DITIONS WAKKANT. President Wilßon has instructed all departments which art* investigating soaring food prices to submit detailed reports to him. If these reports warrant it, he may ; urge congressional action on the question at the present session, in a special message to congress at a later date. The president is said to feel that i the food situation is one which de mands the most thoughtful consider ation by the government. He is already giving his personal attention to the question. Seven Department* at Work. To help hammer down the high cost of living by punishing possible food conspirators, the department of justice joined six other government branches in their fight against high food prices. With the president taking a per sonal interest in the situation, and congress, the agricultural, commerce' and postoffice departments and the interstate commerce commission all leagued in the move, the justice de- j partment assistance gave hope of pos sible solution of the high living cost j question. Specifically, the department of jus-] tice is, at the start, merely rkirmish ing around in the "smokj" to see if j there isn't some "fire" in the talk of illegal food price conspiracies. George; W. Anderson, a department agent, j has been designated special assistant | to the attorney general, with the ex-; press power to probe and prosecute! any violations of the conspiracy lawsi in any section of the country. No Direct Evidence Yet. The department claims to have no direct evidence yet that the present abnormal prices are due to other than natural, economic causes, but It In tends to get at the bottom of reports that the country is being held up by unlawful price boosters and specu lators. In short, the department hopes to give valiant aid to the cause of hunting out the underpinning be neath constantly increasing cost of existence. While the department burrows into the channels of trade the depart ments of agriculture and commerce, with other agencies, will continue efforts to lower prices. Congress promises to make a mighty noise—and perhaps aim to do a little effective work—toward altering conditions. However, the most mooted congressional panacea —a food embargo against foreign na tions—will meet with one of the still est fights congress has seen in many months. The one- Idea which appears to be most agreed upon Is a congressional Investigation or an authorization for the federal trade commission to delve Into the food cost problem. R. A.
