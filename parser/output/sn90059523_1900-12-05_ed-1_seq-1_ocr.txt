VOL. XXIII.- NO. 339. Mi GETS 111 11 FOUR MINOR RILLS WERE TAKEN IP AND PASSED YES TERDAY ship SUBSIDIES GST-1 START SENATOR FRYE'S MEASURE IS NOW THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS FAT BONUS FOR THE LINERS Under the Provision*: of the Pro posed Aft a Twenty-One-Knot Ship Would Draw $304, -000 Annually. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4-Tne pro gramme of the senate leaders for - a business session was taken up in earnest today and material progress was marie. What is popularly known as the ship sub sidy bill was made the unfinished busi ness of the senate instead of the Spoon er Philippine measure and the discussion of it was opened by Mr. Five, of Maine, chairman of the committee on commerce from which the measure was reported. He addressed the senate today for more than an hour and a half. Recognized by his colleagues as an authority upon the subject, he was accorded close at tention. He had not concluded when the senate adjourned. The great crowds of yesterday were absent and business on tho floor proceed ed exactly as if it was mid-session. As soon as the session opened the cre dentials of Senator-elect Dolliver, of lowa, were presented and he was seated. Mr. Dillingham, the new senator from Vermont was assigned membership on the following committees: Civil service, engrossed bills, territories, transporta tion routes to the seaboard, additional accommodations for the library of con gress, and Indian depredations, and Mr. Dolliver to Pacific railroads, agriculture, education . and labor, . interstate - com merce, postoffice and post roads and im provements of the Mississippi river. Bills on the calendar were passed as follows: BILLS PASSED. To authorize the use of depositions be fore naval courts in certain cases, with an amendment restricting its operation to deposits taken at the instance of the accused; to authorize Capt. N. M Brooks, superintendent of foreign mails, to accept the decoration of Red Eagle of the third class from the emperor of Germany; to authorize Hon. J. D. Meikle john to accept the decoration of chevalier of the first class from the government of Sweden and Norway; to encourage the holding of an Interstate and West Indian exposition on Charleston," S. C., in 1801. The measure appropriates $250,000 and ad-, mit- exhibits free of .duty. The resolu tion offered by Mr. Chandler on May 25 last to refer the credentials of William A. Clark and Martin Maginnis,. appoint ed senators from Montana to the com mittee on privileges and elections, was called up by Mr. Carter, of Montana, but went over until tomorrow. 7-777 When the unfinished business—tlie Spconer Philippine bill—was laid before the senate at 12 o'clock, Mr. Frye, hay. ing previously yielded the gavel to Sen ator Gallinger, moved that the senate proceed to the consideration of the bill to increase the commerce of the United States, to provide auxiliary transports, cruisers and seamen whenever neces sary, better known as "the ship subsidy bill." The effect of the motion was to make the subsidy bdl the unfinished •^business.' _ Mr. Jones (Ark.), demanded the yeas nays: The motion prevailed 28 to 20. SHIP SUBSIDIES. "■ Mr. Frye, the sponsor for the bill, ad dressed the senate in explanation of it. His statement was elaborate, and at * times eloquent. - Taking up that provision of the bill which provides the amount of subsidy to be paid vessels, he explained how thi payment was regulated. He said that by the terms of the measure a ten-knot vessel out for 175 days would draw 5 5, --000 a year beyond the cost of her coai and handling, and that the amount of the subsidy would in percentage dimin ish with the increase of the speed of the ship. Mr. Clay (Ga.) asked if it were true that a twenty-one-knot ship would draw under the bill, $304,000 a year. Mr. Frye admitted that it was. "I understand," said Mr. Clay, "that ■ * the ten-knot and twelve-knot ships, which carry the agricultural products of the country, do not receive more than one-third the subsidy of the fast passen ger vessels, which carry no agricultural products." "And I was showing," responded Mr. Frye, "that the low-sperd vessels were " the ones which received the actual ben efit of the subsidy, and not the,fast pas senger -ships." -^ At this point Mr. Frye yielded the floor for the day, and the senate, at 3:55, held a brief executive session, after which it adjourned. WANTS FREE REGISTRY. Just before the adjournment of the Senate today Senator Vest gave notice of an amendment be will offer to the ship subsidy bill. The amendment pro vides for the repeal of such existing laws "as either prohibit or restrict citizens of the United States from purchasing ships built in other countries to be used in th.? foreign carrying trade of the United States, or which, impose taxes, burdens - or restrictions on such ships when owned by American citizens which, are not im posed on ships built in the United Staters." In addition to the repealing provision the amendment make.? It law ful "for all citizens of the United States to buy ships built in whole or in vpart in any foreign country and have them reg istered as ships of the United States." When so registered these foreign built vessels are under the terms of the amendment, to be entitled to all the rights subjected to the same regulations as those governing ships built in the United States and owned by citizens of this country. CABINET MEETING. The cabinet meeting today developed nothing of especial interest. Several members left early to attend a wedding, pud the- others remained only a short time. A copy of the civil municipal code for the Philippine islands, which had been prepared by the United States Phil- ipplne commission, was presented to the meeting, and the portion relative to the collection of the revenues was read. - The code, it is said, follows closely along the lines of the laws of the United States, guaranteeing civil and religious liberty and protection for persons and property. The code will not go into ef fect until it has met with the approval of the president, and It is possible, that congress may be suggested to more ful ly meet the views of the administration. It was announced that Gen. Chaffee has telegraphed the secretary of war, ask ing for authority to provide more suita ble quarters for the legation in Pekin during the winter months. „7 ; 7

HAVANA'S CONVENTION. DELEGATES HAVE THREE CONSTI- TUTIONS TO DISCUSS. HAVANA, Dec. 4.—The Cuban consti tutional convention resumed its sessions today with an air of business. The first business*"done""was*to defeat over whelmingly the resolution of Gen. Gual berto Gomez to discuss Gen. Wood's ad dress at the opening of the'convention. This action will probably close the inci dent. Three complete constitutions were sub mitted by Gen. Rivera, Senor Que-eda and the colored. Gen. Morua, respectively. These will be printed and distributed among the delegates, - who will discuss them later. Gen. Rivera's proposed constitution provides for a president,, a senate, a house of representatives, a governor for each of the six provinces, a const'tution al body for each province and for one member of the house of representatives for each 30,000 inhabitants, to be elected by popular vote. His scheme called also for the election of three electors in each municipal district, whose duty it shall be to elect a S legislative body for the province in which they reside. This leg islative body shall elect the governor and four members of the senate. Final ly, the six legislatures shall meet and choose the president, who shall be a na tive Cuban. Candidates for senatorial honors must have at least incomes of $1,500 a year. Gen. Rivera's idea is to have the power vested in the central government, and the convention- virtually, pledged itself to one state government at yesterday's ses sion. -.'.>>.

WEDNES DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 5, 1900. ii a si BUT THE CONGRESSMEN MANAGED TO PASS THREE BILLS iJMY BILL IS 10 COME I)PT#Di! AND THE RULES COMMITTEE AL LOWS BIT SIX HOURS' DEBATE S'ULZER HAD AN OBJECTION But That Makes No Difference, and Congressman Hall's Measure Will Be Pushed Through In a Hurry. WASHINGTON, Dec. The session of the house today was brief. The real' work will begin tomorrow when the house will consider the army reorganiza tion bill, which Mr. Hull, chairman of the committee on military affairs, re ported today. He explained the urgent necessity for immediate action upon this measure, as under the present law the army must be reduced to 27,000 on July 1, next, and asked unanimous consent for the consideration of the bill tomorrow, but Mr. Sulzer.(N V.) objected, so Mr! Hull introduced a resolution for a spe cial order for the consideration of the bill tomorrow with provision for a vote at the end of six hours general debate.

Shaw and Connor took the oath. Three bills were passed un der the call of committees, the most important being one to provide for the detail of not to exceed 100 retired army officers and 300 non-commissioned officers as military Instructors in the public schools of such cities as adopt a system of military instruction. The others were to "prevent the failure of military jus tice," and to legalize an issue of $250,010 of bonds by Pima county, Arizona."

The vol unteers under the present law, he said, must be mustered out July 1 and every one must feel the imperative need of providing for a new army. He asked unanimous consent that the bill be taken up tomorrow. "1 object." said Mr. Sulzer (N. V.). "If the gentleman desires to consider the bill he can bring in a rule." . The usual resolution for the distribu tion of the president's message was adopted and the house then proceeded to business under the call of committees. The bill first passed was one to pre vent the failure of military justice. It was explained that its purpose was to amend the laws relating to military court-martial and the civil trials of sol diers. Mr. Marsh (111.) then had passed a bill '"to -provide military instruction in the public schools,'"' and a bill also was pass ed authorizing Pima county, Arizona, to issue bonds to the amount of $250,000.

CANNOT RE VIOLATED BY THE STATE IN THE MANNER ATTEMPTED SAME JUDGMENT BY AIL Although This Judgment "Was . Reached .on Different Grounds —Gen. Bunn Explains the Important Ruling. The following exhaustive statements bearing upon the Anderson law, which the United States supreme court has just declared to be unconstitutional,- were made yesterday afternoon to the Globe by Charles W. Buim, general counsel of the Northern Pacific. Mr. Bunn covers the matter thoroughly, and in addition to his statements, as published in the Globe yesterday, gives a clear expo sition of a case in which. Minnesota has for some time been deeply interested: "Congress on July 2, 1864, incorporated the Northern Pacific Rail re ad company, to build a railroad from Lake Superior to Puget sound. In this chartar the com pany was authorized to accept any grant from' any state, and was also required, before it should build through Minneso ta or Wisconsin, to obtain the consent of the legislatures of those states, in this charter congress male a grant of lands to aid the company in construct ing its railroad. OTHER LANDS GRANTED. "Congress also granted lands to the state of Minnesota to aid the construc tion of a railroad from the Mississippi river to Lake Superior. The state in corporated the Lake Superior & Missis sippi company for Ibis purpose (after ward St. Paul & Duluth Railroad com pany). "In 1865, before either road was built, the state granted to the Lake Superior & Mississippi company the lands si granted to the state by congress, and provided that the company should pay to the state perpetually 3 per cent per annum on its gross earnings, which should be in lieu of all taxation, both on the lands and on the company's other property;, but the lands should become taxable as fast as they were sold or dis posed of by the company. This agree ment was put in the shape of a contract between the state and the railroad com pany, was accepted by the company, and on the faith, of it the company built its railroad from St. • Paul to Duluth. '•1n.'1870 'the- same act was applied to the Northern Pacific Railroad company and T its lands, .which act was also ac cepted \by the Northern Pacific, and line was built .by its projectors through Minnesota in reliance on . the faith of the state as pledged in the said contract. "The roads were built and many mil lions invested in the state in reliance on these contracts, and the companies have always paid into the state treasury the stipulated annual payment of 3 per cent on their gross earnings, which payment for the last year amounted, in the case of the Northern Pacific, to $190,40017- -in £ e-7,f of the St. Paul & Duluth,'"to ">■>■>, < ,}>. li. The companies are undoubted ly bound by these contracts to continue such annual payments to the state, in lieu of ■ other taxation. iel' e In895 tne Sislature passed, and in 1836 the people approved,..an act which provided that all land grant lands grant ed by the state,' or the United States or tne territory of Minnesota, to any railroad company, should thereafter be assessed and taxed as other lands are taxed, and also that the railroad com panies should continue to pay taxes into the state treasury upon their gross earn ings In the same manner and in the same amount as then required by law. "The railroad companies challenged the validity of the last "mentioned law as be ing contrary to that provision of the con stitution of the United States, * which prohibits a state from passing any law violating the obligation of a contract. IN THE SUPREME COURT. _ The case involving this serious and fundamentally important question as well as several other difficult questions not here stated, was argued in the su preme court of Minnesota, and in that court under the rules an hour and a half on a side only was allowed to the discus sion. The time so allowed was wholly inadequate, and did not enable counsel to present to that court the case with that fullness and thoroughness which its importance and difficulty demanded. "On the other hand, the supreme court of the United States first heard the case argued, allowing three hourse to each side for its presentation, then, desiring more light, ordered the case reargued at the next term, allowing two hours on a side at the second argument. It has in that court been fully, fairly and exhaus tively considered. It is clear that that court has not passed on the case until each one of the nine judges thoroughly understood and digested it. "The supreme court of Minnesota did not question that the contract was one fairly entered into, clearly expressed and performed in letter and spirit by. the railway companies. But the supreme court of Minnesota decided the rather technical point that the legislature of the state had no power to make such a con tract, because forbidden to do so by those provisions of the constitution of Min nesota, adopted in 1858, which say in sub stance that all property should be taxed according to its value; that there shall be no discrimination and shall be uniformity in taxation. "But the supreme court of the United States has unanimously decided that the state cannot, in the manner attempted, violate the obligation of this contract so fairly entered into and performed. "Apparently the majority of the court in. the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Brewer, holds that as to this property, devoted to a public trust to build rail ways for public use and the development of the state, the legislature had a per fect right to make any contract it pleased with respect to taxation; that the United States government, the original owner of the land, might,- in granting it, have provided for its immunity from taxation, and consequently the state, as the agent of congress, to execute the trust, might do the same thing; and that the pro visions of the state constitution,, that property should be taxed according to its. value in money, did not apply to the situation. Apparently Mr. Justice White, Harlan. Gray and McKenna did not con cur in this conclusion, but concurred In the judgment on a different ground, viz. that the state at least could not, as it attempts to do in the act of lSfco, dis affirm the contract by taxing the land grants and in the same breath appropri ate and retain all the benefits of the con tract," that is, by compelling the com panies to continue to pay : 3 per cent on their gross earnings. ; : ;

When the steamship - Stillwater arrived here from Port Barrios, Guatemala, today, her of ficers and a number of the crew were at once taken before a notary, where they made statements relative to an outrage upon an American citizen. R. H. May, an American citizen, who once served the government of Guatemala as the con tractor for the Guatemalan . . Northern, was arrested at the gangway of the steamer at Port Barrios and thrown into prison on the charge of attempting to leave the republic without having paid his debts. The animosity of the officials of the little republic against May Is prob ably, attributable to the fact that Mr. Kenner, the British umpire in the arbi tration of the case of May against the government of Guatemala, recently ren dered a judgment in favor of the claim ant to the amount of $140,000 American gold on a contract which May had with the government to operate and improve the railroad."
