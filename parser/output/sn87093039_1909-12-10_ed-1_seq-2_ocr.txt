'I l« I It 10, 19 OB The Result of the City Election Quite a bit of good-natured rivalry entered into the election of the munic ipal officers last Tuesday. So far as we can note from surface indications the rivalry did not reach the point of creating ill-feeling. That the matter of who should be mayor for the ensu ing year was not definitely settled, should be a matter for legret. If, as a prominent attorney has said, it was necessary to elect a mayor at this time, it had been vastly better to have put two candidates before the voters. Should the old council refuse to issue a certificate of election to the candidate who was elected on the face of the returns, and the present incum bent continue to serve, the question, "Can a mayor, illegally holding office, make a binding contract?" must con front the council every time an ordin ance comes up to be signed. It had been much better to have settled this question before than have it come up after the election. We often hear some one deplore the snow-fall, rwho underestimates the ben efits of the snow to crops and particu larly to the fruit crop. The snow acts as a blanket to the trees and prevents the injury which freezing weather would undoubtedly cause if the ground was bare. The twelve or fourteen inches of snow which fell the past week insures a full crop of apples next year. The shortage in the fruit crop the past season was caused by the ground being bare of snow last winter up to the 23rd of December, inconse quence of which the ground froze to a depth of from six to ten inches. We hailed the snow with delight, and would have been pleased to see it two weeks earlier. This paper does not yield to anyone in the pride it takes in Washington and all of its worthy public citizens. It would have rejoiced to see Mr. Sec retary Ballinger come out of the Glavis controversy "whiter than snow," but it can not close its eyes to the fact that the last number of Collier's magazine contained very convincing proof of Mr. Ballinger's wrong-doing,"not to use any term more harsh. The standard of civic righteousness set by Colonel Roosevelt should weighl'against preju dice, sympathy or pride. Every good citizen should cry aloud, and spare not. Mr. Ballinger has disappointed his own people. Can Mr. Chancellor Day witewash the sugar trust? He has been elo quently silent on the holiness of trusts and the divinity of money for the past few months. How much did'the sugar trust give to the Syracuse university, anyway? _______^_^_ Superintendent McDonald, of the Wenatchee Valley & Northern railway, tells The Echo that the spur from the main line up to the head of main Chumstick is just about completed. The spur runs to Adams & Costello's logging camp, where a hundred men will be employed this winter in log ging. A number of substantial houses have been erected.for.the accommoda tion of the men and teams as well as for feed and supply storage. It is said that a year or more will be consumed in getting the logs from the vicinity, there being several sections of good timber to be logged off.

DAVIS. Postmaster. One or two parties who have been living in Leavenworth the past summer went to the Sound country some weeks ago, claiming they did not like the prospects of a Leavenworth snowy win ter. The aforesaid parties are welcome to their choice of a habitat. In the past two weeks the Sound country has had its annual flood, which was more destructive than usual. A damage of over a million dollars has been caused to the coast lines between Tacoma and Bellingham. Thousands of acres of rich land in Snohomish and Skagit counties have been inundated by both salt and fresh water through the break ing of dykes. Roads and bridges have been washed away by the same, and the loss of crops and other farm property has been enormous. Heavy rains and high tides have flooded Ho quiam, South Bend, Aberdeen and other tidewater cities, and to cap the climax, a big fall in temperature the past few days, with heavy snow storms and high winds, have altogether made the Puget Sound winter climate a raging nightmare and a thing to be dreaded, alongside the peaceful, quiet snowfall at Leavenworth and an equa ble temperature that is bracing and enjoyable. Oh, you flood, fog and mist victims of the Sound! Come to Leavenworth and enjoy real decent winter weather, where no such disa greeable surprises are in store. Wanted Lady assistant for office.

Oeorge Hoxsey, who has been as sisting at the Tumwater Savings Bank, returned to school Monday. Nora Debord, who was detained at home a part of last week with a sprained ankle, is in school again. The following new names appeared on the roll this week: Wallace Snyder, from Everett, Wash.; Willie Carnahan, Cascade Orchards; Helen, Paul, Harry and Earl Osborne, recently from West Virginia; Earl and Charlie Seagraves, from Franklin Park, 111. Last week a class in book-keeping was organized, in which the pupils will receive instruction in practical book keeping, commercial law, business forms, commercial paper and banking. The deplorable accident Bessie Wal ker met with Monday afternoon will probably keep her from school for some time. Cleopatra For nearly two thousand years it has been common for men to say regret fully that for a woman Anthony threw a world away. Maybe it has all been sympathy wasted. Old Plutarch was not a bit sentimental, but his descrip tion of Cleopatra makes it reasonably clear that the woman had a more masterful brain than the man and withal a charm of womanhood well nigh irristible. He admits that there were more beautiful women, but he adds: "The attraction of her person joining with the charm of her conver sation and the character that attended all she said or did, was something be witching. It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one lang uage to another; so that there were few of the barbarous nations that she answered by an interpreter; to most of them she spoke herself, as to the Ethiopians, Iroglodytis, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes, Parthians and many others whose language she had learnt." The rough Roman sol diers under her spell gave a world for her and thought the price was cheap. She leavenworth Jgcho. SCURVY AMONG STARVING I. W. W. PRISONERS Spokane, Dec. S—Disease resembl ing scurvy has broken out among 1. \Y. W. prisoners confined in the old Franklin school building. It is believed to be the result of lack of vegetatble food. The gums of three men have turned dark blue and their teeth are so loose they can scarcely keep them in their sockets. The police have reduced rations in the effort to starve the revolu tionists into submission to the anti street speaking ordinance. The Franklir* school building is declared to be in a frightfully un sanitary condition. It has not been scrubbed since the prisoners were taken there. THE TAFT POLICIES An Outline of the Recommendations of the President to Congress in His Annual Message. Washington, Dec. 7.—The program placed before congress by President Taft in his annual message is the most extensive and ambitious ever proposed by a chief executive. It even dwarfs the recommendations made by Roosevelt. Ten main poli cies are urged by the president, be sides a list of minor items covering routine matters and questions of secondary importance. They are: Supervision of the issue of stocks and bonds by interstate corporations. Readjustment of the duties and powers of the interstate commerce commission. Expansion of the duties of the bureau of corporations. Creation of a new bureau in the department of justice to deal with violations of law by interstate car riers. Establishment of a go-called "rail road court." Amendment of the Sherman anti trust law. Creation of a postal savings bank. Ship subsidies. Amendment of the procedure re garding the granting of injunctions. Conservation of natural resources. One of the minor policies favored by the president is the consolidation into a national health bureau of all instruments for the investigation, prevention and cure of disease, which are now included in the na tional government or may properly be included. Would Control Stocks. The recommendation for the con trol of the issue of stocks and bonds by corporations is aimed at the evil popularly known as stock water ing, while those for the expansion of the duties of the bureau of cor porations and the creation of a new bureau in the department of justice to deal with violations of the anti trust, anti-rebate and railroad laws suggest closer inspection and con trol of interstate corporations. Those for the readjustment of the duties and powers of the interstate commerce commission, the creation of a railroad court and the amend ment of the Sherman anti-trust law, are partially in line with Roosevelt's plans and partially to the initiative of President Taft himself. The work ings of the railroad rate law have not been entirely satisfactory in practice, and this proposed legisla tion is for the purpose of remedying the defects in the act. President Taft would divide the executive and judicial functions of the commission, giving the last nameil to a court proper. ONE 

KILLED, SEVEN HURT Party of 13 Coasters Hurled into Telephone Pole. Portland, Dec. 6. —While dashing wildly down a steep hill, a bobsled carrying 13 young Portland pleasure seekers careened from the beaten path and crashed into a telephone pole. The blow dashed one of the occupants of the six coasters to death, another, it is expected, will not survive and others are injured. Zelaya Seeks an Investigation. Managua, Dec. s.—President Ze laya has asked the United States to send a commission to Nicaragua to investigate conditions existing here, and says that if its findings show that his administration is det rimental to Central America he will resign. President Zelaya believes the information sent to the United States regarding cruelties practiced by his government is prejudiced. To Reduce Homestead Residence. Washington, Dec. 7.—Senator Bo rah will introduce a bill reducing the homestead residence period on gov ernment irrigation projects to three years; a bill providing for aiding in the development of towns on gov ernment projects and a bill author izing a $200,000 public building at Twin Falls, Idaho.
