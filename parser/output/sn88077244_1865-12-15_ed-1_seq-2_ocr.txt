What a pity to stop these worthies in so laudable and characteristic an mnlei taking. They evidently nntleipatcd a carnival of blood that w ould put all of Stanton's for mer acts of the kind entirely In tlie simile. But the president's decision not to allow a military commission for the, trial of Davis, ha extinguished all their hopes In this direction, and both tuny now devoutly ex claim "Othello's occupation's none!"

The people are nick of the bloody Roencfi which havesooften dlsgraciil lis as a people during the last few months, and they want no more of them. Prenl dent Johnsons, in this dwlsioii, has acted the part of one who Is guided by reatnn and hunuinlty, as well as a regard for the laws of the land, aud tlie country will ap . plaud him for It. 1 Fanaticism. The Cincinnati Commercial, enough of common sense to appreciate and be dls ' gnstod with the fanaticism of Kcmnkr, ar rives at tlie subjoined nonsensical conclu sion as to Its effex't: "If Mr. rlumner does not succeed in re Btoring the Democratic party to iower, and with It the old. iHilitical traitors of the ' South, It will not ln his fault. He Is doing all that one man in an Influential position can do, to bring about that result." To which the (liicago Ttmn thus aptly and truthfully responds: "By this Is meant that the republican party will become nauseated with Sumnkh's fanaticism and malevolence. The truth is, he never has taken a position to which the party did not speedily advance, lie is the leader of the party in the Senate. What lie illrects. tlie Senate will do. What the Senate may do, the House w ill Indorse, and what the house Indorses, the republican press the Cota mereial Included will commend, There would be much more of consistency, ir not decency, In tlie denunciations of radicals by professed conservative republicans if ; their authors were not tlie political allies of those whom they denounce. Spmnkk can not present the negro to his party In a form ,, so revolting, nor attach to tlie act, coudi tions so onerous, that it will not swallow " him. The Commercial has given occasional evidence of the nausea for two years past but still it guljw him down at the bidding of raiHualdiHitors." ' . J J Thk Potato Tkam at DirraoiT.-r-Thc Detroit Fret Prett estimates that during , the present season 137,500 bushels of voU- toeshava been shipped from that city. It says that at tho opening of the season the prices paid did not vary far from 'JO cents , perbushc). . Tlu y raphlly advaucud under , tUu sllmuliis of a large deniaud, until they reached 60 cents per busliel and upwards. The average price paid throughout the whole season was 45 cents per bushel. This makes the sung silul of UU,874 mkl to the farmers In' that market alone for Ktatoes , fur shlpmant. 1 . l ! f ' The Penlau Imbroglio still continues. Colonel Cllahony hat recelvod assurances of sujiport from circles In Boston Brook . lyn, Kew York and Philadollit aud Is constantly in. receipt of letters advising that he stand Arm and await the action of the approaching Congress of the Brother- . hood. t)u tlie cuuLrary, that SuuaUiis con fldent of susUlnlng thecharg:os laid against Messrs. O'Mahony and Kllllan, and several Utates have pledged an effective allegiance to the new adudulstroilou. It apiiears that John Mitchell received 17(1,000 of the funds , o the Brotherhood for .European distribu tion. Stephens, the Head Center for Ire land, Is dally expected at New York. The Collector of Internal llcvenne for Montana Territory, In a letter read at the Treasury yesterday says : The product of the gold and silver mines of that territory for tlie year 156 will be upwards of 1(1, 000,000.

SCOTT. JACOB M. SCOTT. CINCINNATI, OHIO. December 11. 1865. The President and Congress. Willi reference to the power of the Pres ident to carry out the principles of his message In the Administration of the t!ov erumeiit, the Albany .Inan says: He makes theoretic recommendations, based tiHii Constitutional law, to men who mock at all Constitutions, ami w hose w ill is a higher law than man's enactment or (iod's word, lie speaks of state rights to a Congress that had prewired tlscll to re- eive his message, liv the uislraneliisement if a dozen Stales, tie siH'aks of ceouoinv lo a body of scctilatiug legislators, lie alksnt inoderal ion ami prudence to hanks which Issue an irredeemable paT. lie counsels the is'Ople, to counsel earn other to liav tiicir debts; when we have just set all example of public indebtedness such us no nation lias eipialleil. lie ad vises the retrenchment ol currency in lace of the fact that our paM-r circulation has risen tn live years, from firn immlrcil mil lions to anrra hundred millions, and tlie cry is for more. He asks a Congress whose members have liccu chosen bv the corruot contributions of tlie protected interests, to inoillly tlie tarill to revenue pni siscs; aim he records the opinion "that no favored class should demand freedom fmm assess ment, and the taxes should be distributed so as not to fall unduly iiKin tlie poor, but rather iiihmi the acjuinuiiu.ci wealth ol the country, in the face of the conureasloual action and judicial decision which exempt the Immense class of federal boiidliolders from all participation in the support of statu and municipal uuruens. Political Sermons. It Is not often that we see anything to commend in political sermons. But there Is so much of tact and common sense In tire subjoined extract from one preached by a clergyman in Philadelphia, on TUurs day last, that we reproduce it by way of contrast with those which were generally delivered on that day "Wo have at present thrown ukiii the world about four millions of human beings wlio never had any care or anxiety about the future; and w hat is being dune to bet ter their condition r i admit there is nnv iiiantity of sympathy, but that neither shelters, feeds, nor clothes these unloi'lii natii creatures who are without friends or homes, llicy are dying by hundreds anil thousands, these, very unfortunate negroes who have been cruelly and unkindly treated in tlie wav lu which they have been thrown iiimiii the world. If slavery 'Wax to lie got rldof in this country if the people had wished it, it should have been done gradually. Their condition is deplorable in the extreme, aud the hot breath of the U'slilciice is sweeping over litem like tlie sirocco of tlm desert. It is the duty of those who brought theiii to this condition lo provide for them, for they are mostly that iHirtion of the American ncoiilu whose ancestors w ere chiefly concerned in bring ing African slaves to this country, and who reaped immense fortunes thereby : the In habitants of the Stales of Massachusetts aud Uhode island should lake care of these lH.'oplo now. ' Preston King. The JirtirstiJ of (hmmtrec of Monday has the following concerning the supposed sui cide of Preston King But two week have passed since the su- liosed suicide, of 1'rcston King, and Hie. sad affair seems to have nearly faded from the uiindsol men. Could the veil be lilted anil an insight given of the hearts of many, it is to lie feared that to hundreds, who hoped to prollt by his death, tlie event has been a source ul secret ri'lolcliig. 1 he belief, how ever, among those who think at nil upon the sul net. Is gaining ground that Mr, King lias not committed suicide, but has wandered oil into some retreat of which this city is full, where lie will yet be found Ami while the mere fact of tlie body not having been discovered affords no evidence that no suicide was committed, vet In stances are by no means iniamnnon of s r sons supMsed to have been made away with, voluntarily' or otherwise, re-appearing In full lile and health. , it must bs coufcsscil, also, Unit various reasons seem to give color to tho aiitl-aulciOo theory.

It is saiil that the Kuiperor Napoleon, a short time since, addressed alelU:r dinit to the Secretary of rilale, inking Ktr tile1 recognition, by the llniU'iKstjites. of Maxi milian's iiovernuient as a t lovi iiinent Ji m to. The ground upon which he hasod his ruett was null It had maintained ilsi-u for nearly two ymrs, and was, therefore, eiilitlcd to such roeognil ion. It is said that the Secretary of Stale has. rxplicd to the uoto, 111 w hich be oinihalicaily Ici11iips to accede to tlie reiilesU and gives, at lengtll, the reasons therefor, tie dmiies that it, ' is S itovcrumcnt tie tiu tv ; that the whole peo ple of tile l? lilted Suites are iilcilged against any such recognition, if lliere were any grounds for il, which there are not; that, from the beat Information obtainable. tVom that distrained country, tlie Liberal parly bate, not yielded oliodieiicc, and do not in tend to; but, ou tlie contrary, their cause Is iu Uie ascendant.
