NASHVILLE UXION AND AMERICAN. THUESDAY. DECEMBER 10, 1874 THTRSDAT, DECENBF.B 10, 1874. Ben Butler is reported to be on a scalp hunt lie is said to be closely watching Metsrs. Foster, Garfield, Blaine and Phelps, and is reported as declaring ttat Le will have their scalps before the session is over. The Gallatin Examiner in its last issue, epeats of CoL R. A. Cox as hav ing withdrawn from the Congressional race in the Fourth District. There must be some mistake about this, as we have private advices to the effect that he is still on the track. Grant's ominous allusion to the possible need for intervention in Cuba, leads the Cincinnati Gazette to suggest that insurrection prevails also in Spair, and we might savo both time and trouble by settling the affairs of Spain herself, when Cuba would, doubtless, follow suit. The rum loaned by the French Rothschilds to the Spanish Republic Booms very large when stated as being 30,000,000 reals. On learning that a Spanish real, of the purest coinage, is worth only twelve and a half cents, the figures shrink to 3,750,000 in dol lars. But Spanish coinage is some times so base that a "real" is really worth only five cents. Aftee the almostJunaninou8 pass age by the House last Tuesday, of a Lili forbidding Congressmen to act as attorneys for revenue officers and each, Ben Butler doubtless rejoices that his term expires so soon- His profits in the Sanbcrn contracts, the moiety sys tem and half a hundred other rascal ities, were pretty much all raked in under the plea of attorney's fees. After the passage of Tuesday's bill, Butler will not want to be a Congress man any more. If national legislators are to be thus hampered, he can do 1 etter skirmishing on the outside. EliaS H. Robekts, of New York, a Republican by the way, is facetious He wants two more amendments to. the Fcd-ral Constitution one forbid ding Congress to make anything money except coin, and the other forbidding the impjirment of contracts. Both the Constitution as it stands, though i li,w b-v not resripcted for veara. r u iiac we n.-ea is ameuauieu, ox ue Constitution, but amendment of the administration under it, and the elec- .' 1..-. .,rn , t T11 .Dnaf I " '"" it i.i a, .l :i T AiA.r iceiroauMwoufjiu xvec-t uecuuo. indicate that the people have concluded J One of the immediately risible effects of thi year's elections in the South is an alarming migration of the nesrro est ward mainly into Texas. The fright oned colored people may or may not better their condition m Texas. Their movement, however, is probably not a thmkint; one at alL They simply in blind fear flee from the wrath to come. PhiUidclpliM Press Nonsense ! They did the same thing last year, when there was no election. Agents are in the South this year as they were last, offering the -negroes "big wages" to go. to Arkansas or Texas and work in the cotton Colds there. That is the temptation; there is no scare about it. There is point in hat the Cincin- nati Enquirer says about bayonet rule. Four thousand United States troops are employed in the Southern States, says that journal, to carry elections by their presence, to intimidate white liK-n, to maintain a bayonet govern- uientr to i .rofcof, carpet-bag thieves, an-1, finally, tt establish a reign of ter ror." It will be the duty of the next Congress to stipulate, when it appro priates money for the army, that the soldiers eh;i!l bo placed where they can prevent Indianr from murdering the v. Lites i the West, instead of being ia thi S'.ath,: where their only business is to assist in robbery and pillage.

TIIK KFORCF.IEST IXFASY. Grant, in bis message to Congress, takes a very singular view of hia duty touching the enforcement act. lie pretends to imagine that if a negro is coerced by his employer, or intimidated by a mob into voting any ticket, or prevented from voting, he must employ the military power in the premises. But tbe same thing may be done to white voters ly the Republican manufactu rers in the North, and Grant does not care a "Continental." The Cincinnati Eii'i'ilrer says: "Tiie United States has no more r;i;ht t' send soldiers to take charge cf tue p-'ls because a black man bas been idosullj u.'pnved by a mob of bis vote inau .i iii ui- ci.se ft a wnite man. It wou'd be a curious thing if soldiers 6lioull i e s. ut to regnlate the Massa-hiip-'tts elections because some Demo tmtie bibortrs uiiht pretoid that they Lai been compelled to vote the Repub lican titket or suffer discharge tit the bands of their cm plovers! This principle would enable the United StaUs, by its soldiery, to take c;ire of and regulate all the eiec- t 3- i i - cases of individual oppression. In fact, no Et groat the South dares to ' ' , t.b ,- , , . . " votc the Democratic ticket except at the risk of his life. There is more t-:r- e l,,f ,n..l tl, I, . other.

T11E UUAU LAW. Several of our State exchanges are discussing the backward and almost impassible condition of country roads. The complaint seems louder in East Tennessee than any other section. The road law passed by the last Legislata is generally spoken of as a good one, if it were carried into effect,- but its execution was left optional with each County Court, and it is stated that few, if any, have given ir. the benefit of a trial. Hence, there is a disposition to urge that the la be made compul sory on the counties by further legisla tion. Among the rights dearest to the free American's heart, is the right to be shiftless and thriftless. We do not quite clearly see how this right can be curtailed without imparting a savor of despotism to State rule. If some counties want bad roads to drive men and money from their borders, have they not an inherent and inalienable right to such roads? One of the prob lems puzzling our "statesmen, is how to prevent the emigration of Tenneaseans to the "West. We cannot think of any better plan for keeping these nomads among us than that of allowing them the free indulgence of their primitive and pioneer notions about bridle paths and bear trails being superior to macademized roads. These fellows are fleeing from our super-civilization. If we really wish to restrain them, we must restrain ourselves in our mad cravings for an Appian "Way to every vDlage and hamlet in the State. REPORT OF .THE '03KPTB.OI.LEB OF THE tXRBEXCT. The report of John Jay Knox, Comptroller of the Currency, submit ted to Congress with the President's message, develops some curious facts bearing on the financial problem. Un der operation of the act of June 20, 1S74, over twenty million dollars of legal-tender notes were released from the reserves of the banks. By that act the amount of the legal-tender notes was fixed at 382,000,000, and the re lease of this reserve practically added chised elave." Queer, is it not? Pass more than twenty million to the circu- ing queer, if the President believes half lating medium. It had been locked up his own Ions ritrmarole about "South- in the bank vaults prior to the law of June 20. If there was a pressing de - mandformoremoneyonewouldnatural - ly expect to find this released reserve ab - sorbed into the general circulation. But this has not happened. On the contrary, the banks have held a much larger sum I , .i i oi xawiut money r.uan ai any time Bince th j, or:aai2atiOI, tLe total reserve th - . lastntR x:mimk 1 1. cq i n w"i niiii v. than tfll0f0.000 i"n rru r.f U1C amount required by tie law.

Then we wiii know wnere we 6tand. There is unauestionablv an abundance of onr. renov for tl,e Unreal bn.n, f " day, but it is badly diLributed.

For instance, we miss the scheme for a grand Riparian Canal along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, from the St. Croix to the Rio Grande, to protect our timid shipping from the the inclemencies of the open sea, and to cost two or three hundred millions. Grant's failure to renew this ' recom mendation of his, is the more remark able in view of his anxiety to give re munerative Employment to idle labor. From a Ctesarian standpoint, this would seem the very nick of time in which to push through such a gigantic "improvement," when, as Grant as sures us, labor is "very cheap." Thus, the Government could "economize" at the Bame time that it furnished work for the idle millions. Equally remarkable is tho omission of any reference to the project of dig ging an immense ditch or irrigating canal from the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri, for which the President pleaded so persuasively one short year ago. The need for the ditch remains precisely the same now as then, while it might possibly be utilized as a chan nel of cheap transportation in rivalry of the Pacific Railroad, and would afford winter work and rations for the starving farmers of Kansas and Ne braska, who have been eaten out by the grasshoppers. Santo Domingo, of which we had a bare bubble in the last message, finally and forever disappears from the pres ent one, leaving no trace of the tena cious lodgment it once held in the Ex ecutive cranium. Sic transit. Again: One year ago President Grant closed his message to Congress in these words: I suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law, to better secure the civil rights which freedom should secure, but has not effectually secured to the enfranchised slave. Now he has not a solitary word in favor of Civil Rights for the "enfran- I era outrages." There is something of 1 an inconsistency here. But we give it 1 up, hoping that Grant now laughs as 1 heartily as any of us at these aban - J doned follies rip-roaring and desert I canals, negro annexation, Civil Rights the rEDEBAL

WHAT IS MALA III AT The construction of the Panama Railroad cost eighty-one thousand hu man lives a death-rate equal to one man per yard of the track. Certainly the agencies which prove thus destruc tive to human life deserve more atten tion from the press and the public than they receive. "What is malaria? A few years ago no one suspected that ty phoid fever was the-product of organic life, which was able to propogate itself in milk and in many other rich animal and vegetable substances; yet this is now known to be a well established fact. Malaria from the Pontine marshes of Rome has been killing mankind for unknown centuries without any one "ever finding out how it was done. This special ignorance has been at last, in a good degree, removed, and the abate ment of the evil will be next in order. There is great reason for believing that parasites too small to be seen by the best'microscopes abound in naturo Dissolve a grain of pure salt in a gal lon of pure water, and when the parti cles of salt are equally diffused, take a drop, and with the best magnifying glassor glasses ever made, see, if you can, a molecule of the dissolved salt. By other tests and experiments it is known' that vision hardly approaches the dif fused particles of salt in the drop of water. But if matter really exists in masses so inconcievably small, who dare limit the minuteness of molecules of protoplasm and monads? It is known that the egg of the parent of the silk worm often contains the germs of the parasite which kills the worm, and pre vents its forming any 6ilk. The mala dy is strictly heriditary; but it is life within, life, descending in the egg from one generation to another. All malaria are organisms, some of which are killed by frost like those which produce yellow fever. Frost kills growing corn and cotton, but not the vitality in their ripe seeds. In the same way frost and medicine may kill growing parasites, vegetable or animal, but not their germs. The extermina tion of these appears to demand more advanced science. Civilization begets many sharp necessities, and among thera an ever-expanding wisdom is, I perhaps, the most conspicuous. Tribes 1 and peoples who refuse to study and J learn become extirminated. Pressed I by these stern necessities, many have cursed God and died. Still the laws 1 of nature are inexorable; industry and learning revive; and true science makes society wiser and happier. Fifty years ago chemistry taught the world, and especially the medical stu dent, the names and origin of the nie- phitic gases which produced, as was then believed, all malarial diseases. t.i a. But frost never destroys poisonous gases, nor volatized minerals and metals, like those of mercury and ar senic. Jlalaria is not a gas, nor a va por, nor a sublimated metal, but .a living organism. Some, varieties of these parasites kill hogs under the name of cholera, cattle under the name I 0f murrain, 6heep under the name of i i. I ruia, cuicacua uuuer uic iiawc ui Kiyi, and children under names of worms I nrtH f.vpra.
