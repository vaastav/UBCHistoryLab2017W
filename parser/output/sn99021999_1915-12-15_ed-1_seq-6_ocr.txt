More Trouble Over Mexico. Several times during the last few months It has been asserted the administration at Wash ington Is deliberately suppressing Important facts in connection with the situation in Mexico. These charges have been circumstantially made by responsible persons, and the only official at tention paid to them was through a recent out burst from Private Secretary Tumulty, who flew Ic defend Carranza from accusations brought against him from sources certainly entitled to a hearing. More serious charges are now being made, so far as suppression of tbe true condi tions in Mexico la involved. A newspaper correspondent, who represents two of the really conservative great papers t the country, the Chicago Tribune and the New York Son, gets word home to his papers that it Is almost impossible to send out tbe truth from Mexico. This is because of strict censorship on the cable at Vera Crux and other points, and be cause the only way to get mail out of the City of Mexico is to send it unsealed in the United States pouch, which goes direct to Washington, there to be censored. Such charges as these, defi nitely made by responsible persons, support the allegation that "watchful waiting" bas not been altogether without Its other side. That, while our government may not have "buttedMn." an the president puts it, on Mexican affairs, it has exerted some influence, and still is, in behalf ot Carranza. At any rate, so long as the United States la at peace with the de facto government of Mexico, why should communications between the citizens of tbe two countries by subjected to censorship? What is there to conceal from the people? Peace on the Peace Ship. "Many men of many minds" runs the old nursery ditty to the end that "many men do dis agree." And this is receiving, a beautiful Illus tration Just now in the experlence'reported from Mr. Ford's peace ship. Each of the delegates aboard ship is bent on a great humanitarian mission, and Is thoroughly commit teed to the ideals of "peace on earth and good will toward men." Unfortunately, each individual also has his own view as to how this desirable end la to be attained, and neither feels called upon to en tirely submerge his individuality for the purpose of bringing about unanimity.. As a result, the Ford party is breaking up into groups, and when the shores of warring Europe are reached, tbe rulers of the nations will be perhaps confused by the multiplicity of plans suggested for "getting the boys out of the trenches by Christmas." One can almost imagine the chancelleries of Europe suggesting to Mr. Ford and his associates that they reach some agreement between themselves before they undertake to adjust the muddled af fairs of a perverse world. The Irish Saved the Day. For the first time since the war began British military authorities. .make adequate acknowl edgment of the deathless valor qf the Irish reg iment onthe far-flung battlefront.. Whatever foundation exlated for complaints on this score are disposed of by the details of the heroic battle to the death of the Royal Innlskllllnera against tbe Bulgars on the ridge of Kevls Crest. Rear guard actions usually are fierce, deadly combats, especially for the defenders of tbe, re treating army. The Innlskllllns breasted the oncoming . victorious foe, overmatched, ten to one, and held tbe Bulgars at bay for hours and until the retreating army reached the appointed line of defense. Almost to a man they paid the price with their lives, but they "saved the day," Tbe action and the aacriflce is character iatically Irish. It la the same spirit of valor and sacrifice exhibited at Yellow Ford 600 years ago, at Clontarf and Limerick, in the Peninsula campaign under Wellington, at Cremona and Fontenoy. Every war for liberty, every attack on tyranny, at home and abroad, is marked with the fighting Irish spirit shown in the Balkans. It runs through the history ot the revolution and the civil war, and reached the maximum of slaughter In the fruitless successive charges of Meagher's Irish brigade on Marye'a Heights. "Cursed be the laws which deprived me of such soldiers," exclaimed the second George of England when the Irish brigade at' Fontenoy turned the tide of victory to France. It- has taken England two and a half centuries to learn the lesson and make partial amends to Ireland and her sons. Great Britain's latest Move. John Bull haa always been known for thrift and Is now beginning to exhibit' prudence and foresight, as well. In witness of this we present the fact that Reginald McKenna ia now busily engaged in exchanging British war tasues tor American stocks and bands at the markrprteV. As was pointed out by The Bee some time ago tbe British holdera of American securities were, making a very handsome profit by this exchange, although the total amount had not reached a very high figure. lie tendency of the private owner ot American securities to bane onto them lb natural, and that It should be shared in by tbe British government is not at all astonishing. Mr. McKenna's assurance that he has BO inten tion of flooding tbe American market by throw ing on it a large volume of securities to realise cash was unnecessary. Ths stable character ol American atocka and bonds is such as to make them the most desirable investment known to the world today, and the British government la merely showing good sense In exchanging its own for the Yankee securities. AcoounU ot powder bouse explosions employ the word 'obliterated" ia describing what hap pened to the building. The expression ia likely to become aa common as efficiency. Both are peculiarly fitted to work In unison on explosions. A powder house blowup Is unsurpassed as an ef ficient obllterator. Governor Whitman scores a double bit in ap pointing Oscar B. Straus to tbe vacant chairman ship of the New York Public Service commission. He aecurea the services of a dlatingulahed citlsen unuaually well equipped for the post and tosses a presidential anchor to tbe windward of Oyater Bay. A Modern Macbeth James Walter anUtk la Bee ton Traaaerip HAD been reading a book called "A Royal Tra- I &)." and had Just turned a page. Then I atopred to think. . The passage I had teen reading ran as follows: "The door opened slowly.' There stood King Alex ander and Queen Draga, both of them hastily and In sufficiently dressed, aa they had sprung from their bed. They found themselvea facing a dense group of officers. It waa a historic but terrible tableau! Klnrf Alexander stepped forward In front of the queen, aa if to shelter her. looked straight at the tratlors and aald: 'What la It you want? and what of your oath of fidelity to me?' There waa a aeoond or two of deadly silence. They looked at each other aa if mesmerized. Then lieutenant , who before en tering the army waa a teacher In a village school, cried out: 'What arc yoti standing gating at? Hero la our oath ef fidelity to him!' Paying thia bo fired on the king, who aank Into the arms of Draga In a moment aeveral revolVere were fired on the fall ing king and on the queen. They both then dropped on the floor. The enraged conapiratore continued for a few seconds firing their revolvers at the royal cou ple, bleeding and groaning on the floor. Then then drew their swords, and began to dash them In all i direction. The poor woman. Queen Draga. wn especially the object of their revolting cruelty, t Fortunately the poor woman waa killed Instantly by the first volley aimed at her. King Alexander, al though pierced by aeveral bulleta. waa not dead. He groaned In agony. In a pool of blood. It la not certain that he waa conscious. Lieutenant Colonel Mlshlch suggested that the bodies of the king and queen ahould be thrown out of the window. Into the Tower garden, that the-eoldler surrounding the palace ahould see that thy were dead. He opened the win dow. Bending over It he ahouted: 'Long live King Peter Karageorgevitch, king of Perrla!' The officer In front of their eoldlera echoed his cry by shouting: Long live King Peter!' ('Zlveo KralJ Peter!')" When the newa of the Belgrade murders flashed acrosa the world. King Peter waa living the plain and peaceful life of a pretender on the bank of LaX Geneva. The romance of youth had departed from him, for he waa 63. and there waa nothing unlesa ie himself knew of It that threatened to disturb the even current of his existence. He waa known to everybody In Geneva a plain Prince Peter Kara georgevitch. His trim, alender, medlum-etsed figure, and Ma fierce military muatachee and fiery eyea, wero aa familiar to the children in the streets as they wer to the frequenters of the moat exclusive . Genevan clubs and salona. Although his house In the Rue Ballot was elegantly furnished, the prince lived In sim ple style. He waa not a rich man. and malntalnel no entourage, more, probably, because he could not afford it than because of ausplcloua which the exig ence of a prlttcely retinue might arouse. A woman servant named Mathilda and a valet named Albert attended to his dally wanta, and a governeas, on Mile, I-agler", Used frequently to coma In, either to answer the old man'a letters or to give Instruction to the children when they were In Geneva. He was a skillful chess player, and when the children were home he used to play with them every evening. Fo Serbians paaalng through Geneva he Vept an open house, and though ordinarily a silent man, he coulj always be roused to tell stories of his military ex ploits. He waa a great lover of black coffee, and smoked bushels ef cigarettes. He waa fond of shoot ing, for he had taken prises at the target and had been a member of the awagger shooting club In Paris. II was also fond of riding, but even at that time hi rheumatism waa troubling him, and he could not lido with hi old-time enjoyment. So far aa hla mental attainments were concerned, he had nothing out ot the common beyond a fine knowledge ot languages and history. Hla favorite authors were Michele:, Thiers and Henri Martin. He had made special atudlea of the Uvea of Catherine the Great and Bismarck, and knew considerable about the Napoleonic period. Ha had translater Into Herbian John Stuart Mill's essay "On Liberty," and for hi aervloe In Introducing' the great English economist work the prince had en Joyed a generoug meed of praise from hla-countrymen. It hum never been proved that Prince Peter was directly connected with the murder of Alexander ani Draga. - The world auspected It. however, and half the world Still remalna convinced of his guilt. It waa algntflcant that the day on which the murder took, place June 11, IWS waa the. thirty-fifth anniversary of the aaaaaslnatlun of King Alexander's grand-uncla, Michael, by Alexander Karajreorgevltch, and doubly Significant that Prince Peter. seemed ready for iiq Immediate departure from Geneva on the day after the murder, or aa aoon as new arrived that tne regicides were willing to make him king. Prince Peter, knowing that theae suspicions of his connection with the conspiracy were widespread, took Immediate occasion to deny hla reaponalbllity. Whosover the guilt, the prince ' waa formally chosen king on June It, and on the S2d ha took ths train for Belgrade. It had been remarked for montli in Geneva that he had looked careworn, and hla ap pearance at th station oa the day of hla departure, surrounded by a crowd In which the faces ef soma Im portant officials were absent, did not strengthen the general feeling that th Journey waa being made with, out misgivings.' He should have been happy, for lie waa returning to hla beloved 8erbla, after an exile of forty-five years, but he waa oppressed by the knowl edge, not only that ha Was under a cloud of suspicion, but that he waa going horn to a country In tha depths -of distress, rent by political strife and hate. Hi own life, he knew, waa not too aafe, and he probably remembered that, of all the klnga whoii Serbia had had. one only had been permitted to die peacefully in bad. If there waa any comfort at all in hla thought, it mutt have eome to him from the fact that af (alra at Belgrade could not be worse than th y were and he had aa opportunity, so long aa he re mained a atrlctly constitutional monarch, that ha might bring back to hla kingdom peace and prosperity and a better place In the world'a regard. . Belgrade gave Peter a splendid welcome, but the people were a llltl , disappointed In hla peiaonal ap. pearance. He did not look like a king, for he n amall and thin, and even his fierce mustaches did not aave him from a certain amount of contempt. He waa gray and wore piincenea and he bore his fifty seven years rather heavily. The coronation waa a brilliant function, but there were few dtplomatlat present, and tha new king knew all too quickly that the official world and the outaide nationa, with one or two exceptions, had given him the boycott. It waa a long time before ha could be brought to repudiate the regicides who had called him to the throne, and even then the repudiation waa only a half-hearted one, forced upon him by the abaolute determination of one ef the great powers not te recognise his kingship until the repudiation-had been made. That was twelve yeara ago. Pefore he left Geneva the prince gave to tha Serbian people the assurance that he would faithfully support aay constltuliu't which the Serbian gave themselves. Since that as surance was given he haa conducted himself aa a strirtly constitutional monarch, and. although he ha naturally been under tha domination of the mtlltaiy party, and has bom himself with credit during th.; wars In which his country haa been engaged, he has been little more than a figure-head. Several timea tha last In May, 1913 his abdication haa been reported, and In June of laat year the crown prince waa ap. panted regent. It waa believed at the time that th king's difficulties with the army had worn him out, although In the royal proclamation Illness and inabil Ity to perform his duUea were given aa th reasons for confiding the government to his hair.

CREIGHTON, Neb., Dec. 14,-To the Editor of The Bee: The season is at hand when tha congress of the United Statea la again in ae salon. For more than a century that body haa created lawa that have governed one of the thus far, most peaceful and enlightened nationa cf the earth. Figuratively speaking the cyea of the world are turned thla way because their action wllL shape the future destiny of men and nyaeurea that will propagate peace or ' precipitate a spirit that will undermine our present literary and religious Institutions, overthrowing the highest Ideals of the fathera and founders of a constitution Intended for the life and liberty of thoae following tn the wake of civilisation' a morn: Perhapa tho greatest question la that of preparedness; and the question arises, "preparedness for what?" There la but one answer. A peace propaganda that will silence the guns of powers, princes and potentates ' of the world. To auc cesafully prosecute the work of promul gating peace, preparedness la needed at an estimated coat of at least 

IISO.OOO.OOO. Take It for granted thla sum la raised, tha next move will be to build navies and guna a little bigger than tha other fel low. With the spirit that prevail now, what will be the result? The productive soil of the husbandman will run red with human blood, with bone and sinew, enriching the mother earth. Our ; high seas colored with gore! for the sake of protecting honor, home and native land. The eet and hand of coming m'lllon must be taxed to protect thoae who rule the earth and commercial lnter eata. Will we stand for it? Let the "Jingo" build his cross of gold. Let the would be statesman who claims to be ataodtng at Armageddon battling for the Lord, battle away. Let the evangelist who deal In fires of eternal torment for mer cenary motives brighten corners for the hottentot and hot headed heads of war ring nationa of the other landa. Let the military spirit of earth be given a death blow without the shedding of human blood. Let honest toll with reasonable reward become one of the fundamental principles of our Industrial system. Let us return to "mush and milk" and first principles and there la no doubt, but the world will grow better If not wlaer. T. J. HILDEBRAND. Wllsoa aad the Message. PLAIN VI E3W, Neb., Dec. 14. To the Editor of The Bee: President I Wilson's message to congreaa la a aurprlae to a great many people of the union, the only one of Ita kind In tha history of the United States. No president before Wilson urged "preperedneae." which meana militarism In time of peace. No president ever attacked an entire nation of "hyphenated Americans." ss he terms them, for aome improper acta done maybe' by some spies or hirelings- Tha "hyphenated Americana" condemns un lawful acta of any kind as well aa Mr. Wilson, but feel insulted by utterances of the Wilson kind. We fear Mr. Wllaon la digging tho grave for the democratic party. A man who cannot control hla feraonal feellnga la unable to lead a political party sue. ceasfully and la undesirable aa the head of a big nation compoaed of different nationalities. Hla measage la liable to prepare a aeed-bed for diaharmony anion the different natlonalitlea In thla country, which a wise president should try to avoid Instead of furthering it. The people of this union are peaceable and It la safe to say that Wllson'a ''pre paredness" bill would be voted down- If put before them. Whom does Mr. Wilson suspect a our enemy? . We know we can handle England be cause we did It before. Japan la feared by aome, but could be handled with our present fleet if a few submerinee would be added. It aeema aa if Mr. Wilson'a conaclence are not clear toward Germany, but the Germane will bother nobody if left alone. All they aak la their plaoe under the sun;: thata what they are fighting for now. We may cool down and rest ay. AN
