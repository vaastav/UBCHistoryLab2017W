THE 

PROBLEM OF ANNEXATION. President McKinley speaks of the annexation of tbe Hawaiian Islands with all the deflnlte nees of one who has no doubt whatever regard? ing the course required by public Interests. When action to that end could safely be de? ferred without repelling tbe declared desire of the Hawaiian people, and virtually inviting oc? cupation of the Islands by other Powers, post? ponement had something to recommend It. The President epeake with full conviction that the timo bas come for action, that the Islands must quickly become the possession of some other Power if not accepted by the United States, and that euch posseslson by a Power ?losslbly hostile to this country would be a men? ace to American commerce in the Pacific and would involve the Nation in vastly Increased expense for the protection of the Pacific Coast It la evidently, as a measure necessary to self protection, and not merely or mainly aa an ad? dition of territory, that the subject le consid? ered. It is no longer s question whether the Islands may at some future time become of value, for annexation must come now, or must be refused without reason to anticipate that It will again become possible. The President refers with lmpresslTeness to the importance of the legislation which annexa? tion wonld tnak<; necessary. Provision for the government of the Islands onder peculiar cir? cumstances, for their occupation and defence by American citisene, for the settlement of questione pending between Hawaii and other Powers, for the regulation of the civil and po? litical rights of the numerous eettlere from Asia and from Europe, and of the natives themselves, will raise many probl?me which Congress might be very willing to defer. New land laws will be needed with special application to the isl? ands, and better means of communicating with them at once, so that a submarine cable en? tirely under United States control may seem to be one of the most urgent necessities, and eleo without delay sufch fortification of one or more harbors that the veeeele of this country may find secure anchorage and defence. If other legislative provisions encourage the mi? gration of cltlzene from thla country, they will within a few years grow strong enough to make any attack by a hostile Power unprofltsble and unwise, but at the outset the establishment of a well-fortified coaling station will be a neces? sity. In view of tht fact that such extensive and Important legislation will In sny event be in volved by Hawaiian annexation, there Is excuse for tbe suggestion made In some quarters that the annexation itself might properly be by act of Congress. In this case the co-operation of the House with the Senate Is obviously essen? tial so thst mere ratification of the treaty, with out Immediate leglslstive provision to carry It Into effect, would by no means satisfy the de? mands of National dignity and honor to which tbe President refers. The form of action is not In this case essential, as It might be if sover? eignty were claimed over the Islands by another Power, and the legal completeness of annexa? tion will not be questioned whether it be ef? fected by mera ratification of the treaty or by art of Congress. But practical annexation re? quires Immediate and thoroughly considered action by both houses, which the President pro? ceed? to recommend with frankly avowed confi? dence that the treaty will be confirmed. It le conceivable that some part of the opposition to annexation would be removed If the conditions under which the Islands are to be admitted should be fully aet forth in an set of admis? sion. Rnt the Message of the President on this sub? ject should not be passed without ample recog? nition of Its wisdom and temperateness In deal lnp with the claims of Japan and with tho whole question of territorial acquisition. In no other state paper has the prevailing spirit of the people been more worthily and frankly ox pressed. Their absolute freedom from hunger for mere enlargement of territory, with result? ing Increase of responsibility, Is not fairly un? derstood by most people ?t other lands, and the President has rendered a valuable public ser? vice In stating it so clearly. K AS SAS 

PACIFIC FORECLOSURE. The overshadowing Importance of other sub? jects which constitute the leading features of President McKlnley's Message should not be permitted to divert attention from that portion of the document which treats of the Interest of the Government in the approaching sale on De? cember 1? of the Kansas Pacific Railroad under the decree of foreclosure. By a fortunate turn of events the Government waa enabled to realize the full amount of Its claims for the principal and interest of the subsidy debt due from the Union Pacific at the sale of that prop? erty under foreclosure proceedings last month. It has been objected to that transaction, and perhaps properly, that the Government, in deal? ing with the Reorganization Commlttee-whleh had raised tbe money and taken all the steps preliminary to th? purchase, under an explicit understanding -v.'h the Government's repre? senta tires? Indulged In sharp practice, which would have subjected individuals or corpora? tions In similar circumstances to censure. But the National Treasury being the gainer there? by, the public as the beneficiary In the end was more Inclined to congratulate itself upon the advantage than to criticise the processes by which It was gained. However that may be. the transaction Is now closed, and that special phase of a troublesome complication, involving great possibilities of mischief, terminated. In the pending foreclosure sale of the Kansas Pacific, however, a question of precisely sim? ilar character Is presented. In the solution of which the danger and risk of a wild venturo upon new. untried and practically r?volu tlon a ry policies are no lees involved. The question, in Its simplest form, is whether the Government, to avoid the |om of a portion of Its Investment In tills subsidized road, shall itself assume and pay the prior lten of over $7,000,000 and there? upon take possession of the property and under? take hereafter to conduct its operations and manage its affairs. To the active and talkative political schemers and dreamers who Include Government control and operation of railroads among their plans for bringing In the millen? nium the ownership of tne Kansas Tacine does not present nearly so many attractions as did that of the Untoli Pacific. The latter was a main line, with terminals and established con? nections, which might easily have been made the stepping-stone to a great Government trans? continental road. The Kansas Pacific, on the other hand, M far as the subsidized portion, about to be sold tinder foreclosure, is concerned. is only a fraction of a road, with no Western terminal, ending abruptly at a mile post on an open prairie. Its possession would be worth? less without the expenditure of large sums to establish connections and purchase terminals. It Is already paralleled to a considerable ex? tent, and competing lines would find It an easy matter to complete the parallel for Its entire l.-neth. These disadvantage*, however, do not disturb the Populists, who are demor?os for Government control at no matter what cost to the National Treasury. The upset price for tbe property, or the sub? sidized portion, as fixed by decree of the court, will yield to the Government $2,500,000 on its claim of nearly $18,000,000. The President an? nounces in his Message that, in order to pre? vent loss to the Governm -nt, he has instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit a sum Sufficient to qualify the Government as a bid? der, and "to bid at the sale a sum which will at 'least equal the principal of the debt due to the "Government," but he asks, "in order to remove "all controversy, that an amendment of the law "be Immediately passed explicitly giving such "powers and appropriating in general terms "whatever sum is sufficient therefor." Such an authorization ought certainly to be had before any steps be taken by the representatives of the Government in the direction of ownership and operation of railroad property. That action would be only the entering wedge for the Ini? tiation of a radical?If not, indeed, revolution? ary?change In our traditional policy. It Is quite possible that the step already taken In making the deposit necessary to qualify the Government as a bidder may be simply for ef? fect upon tho T'nlon Pacific Committee or other bona-flde bidders, and jiosslble, also, that it may in this as In the former Instance result In their raising their bid. But we csnnot help thinking. If It is seriously proposed that the Government shall enter the lists as a bona-flde bidder, with the resultant risk of the property being knocked down to It, that It will be a monumental blunder. The Government can bet? ter afford to lose the entire debt than to assume the prior lien and go into the railroad business. 

SOME QUEER COMMENTS. The comedy element of tho President's Mes I enge?for the gayety of nations seems to re? quire the development of fun In even bo serious a matter?comes from a source not commonly j considered prolific of humor. It la not usual ? to look for Intelligent discussions of American I aftnlrs in the English press, nor even for any | general agreement of opinion upon them, arie? j perhaps In errors. But the most rollicking cari? caturist never conceived a queerer muddle of contradictory misapprehensions than the Lon? don editors appear to have been plunged Into by their correapondents' reporta of Mr. Mc j Kinley's Messaga As a fitting keynote to the whole the remark of "The Daily Telegraph," that "It used to be America's proud boast that she had no foreign policy," may well be quoted. Considering that this Nation has had since the day* of Washington, Adams and Monroe a particularly well-defined and consistent foreign policy, as most European Powers, and Great Britain especially, have frequently had occa? sion to realize In the last hundred years, the observation savors of the sapience of the tradi? tional parboiled owl. Why not add that It is Great Britain's proud boast that she haa no Navy? After this, the deluge. The same paper thinks the Message will surely wound Hpanlsh sus? ceptibilities unless Spain Is thicker-skinned than she is aupposed to be. On the other band, "The Standard" is certain that the President has kept within the limits of international comity and good-feeling. "The Tlmea" fears his tone of patronizing tolerance will not prove wholly agreeable to Spain, while "The Morning Post" declares his treatment of the Cuban question to be studiously correct. "The Chronicle," al? ways least friendly nnd generally least Judi? cious, la not pleased with his declaration that forcible annexation of Cuba would be criminal, and denounces it as a milk-and-water utterance. It would bo interesting to know to what tern f perature Tabasco sauce would have to be heat? ed to be distinguishable from ice-cream by this incandescent palate. According to "The Daily Mail." tho President "comes out strong against the Jingoes." while "The Times" thinks he has trlttl to satisfy the Jingoes by adopting their own tone. Other topics are discussed with the same de? lightful variety of view and Indifference to ob? vious facts. "The Chronicle" deems the Presi? dent's handling nf the currency question "posi? tively childlike," and laments the disappearance of thr.t statesmanlike vigor which it so admired In Its idol. Grover Cleveland. Vet Mr. Cleve? land's other worshipper, "The Dally News," sees in Mr. McKinley'? plan only a repetition of Mr. Cleveland's. "The Morning Post," on the other hand, unhesitatingly pronounces it to be less short-sighted and altogether an improve? ment upon the mljguided policy of last year. One says the Message will raise a storm, an? other that It is absolutely unexciting, ? third that It is vague nnd diffuse and a fourth that It rings true. The Interesting discovery Is made by one that when Mr. Cleveland had Congress on his hands he had it behind him; which seems a somewhat awkward attitude for any one but a contortionist. Mr. McKinley, according to the same authority, has Congress in front of him, though whether he Is driving It or being led by it is not made clear. Really, if the ave-age Englishman reads sev? eral newspapers each day, he must have queer notions of American affairs. Or perhaps he I merely has queer notions of the popera Just as Americans sometimes have of their daily mental pabulum. Only, it Is doubtful if Ameri? can papers at their worst ever make quite so great a variety of errors and display In doing so quite so much partisan passion as MMM 0? their British contempor tries do on this occasion. American papers are now und then a bit too fervid in their treatment of foreign topics. But they do not, as a rule, work themselves luto a frenzy of passion over a Queen's Speech, as though It were a party platform In a red hot local campaign. THE 

MACUISES REQ?LARITT. The only excuse Mr. Qulgg offers for holding primaries next Tuesday, instead of surren dering at once to the general demand f<>r a new organization, Is that the primaries are manda? tory under the constitution, and "cannot be avoided without self-destruction." He says ho would be In favor of organizing anew Imme? diately were It a physical possibility, but tbe failure to hold primaries at the date fixed "would at one? destroy our position as a regu? lar organization." But what Is the use of "regularity" to an or? ganization that Is already irregular? What spe? cial virtue has one particular article of the con? stitution that obedience to It can make regular an organization that has luvited s?'lf-destruc? tion by repented violation of other article? no whit less Important? When Mr. Qulgg sets up this plea he Is simply making mock of his con? stitution The holding of primaries on a certain day will no more give character to an organila? tlon which has systematically violateli tho letter and the spirit of the law srhli h It professe? to ol>ey than will going to church on Raster make a Christian of a man who spendi tin? r???.: of the year In rascality. The only reason th?? organization has for existence is to represent the Republican roter? of this city Thai Ii loes not represent those voters even Mr Qulgg can? not deny. It did not represen! them In pott up General Tracy, f.,r as man] of them roted for Mr. Ixiw as roted fur General 'Irne,). DO! withstanding tin? part ? lie that 1> d matt] l ? vote for the organization candidata who sroold ??ave pref.-rred the nomination of Mr. Low. Mr Qulgg, who before tin? conrentton announced that "the organization" had decided to put up General Tracy, was able t.? point to the fate of Jnc-.b Worth as a warning to all district leaden who might be disposed to advocat? the nomination of Mr I.ow, nnd so forced upon ih*? party a candidate who,:) ir repudiated. Rren election district captains in district! whose vic? had been cast in convention for General Tracy voted at the election for Mr. I.ow. The machine organization Is utterly unn-pr?? sentatlve. Moreover, It is utterly illegal. Not 2 per cent of the district nsso.-latlons have any existence under the constitution. Th?* machine I leaders themselves admit that most of them are dend, unless they can whip their own laws nround the stump of "Impracticability.'' "There fore no primari??? that can be held In those dS trlcta can i>e legal and do committee elected by their representative? can be legal. The new County Committee which would spring from these December primaries Mr. Qulgg Is so par tlculur about would have no more position ss a regular organization than would ? commit? tee elected in January or May, instead of De? cember. The chain Is no stronger than Its weakest link, and an organization la constitu? tional only when It obeys Ita whole constitu? tion. Mr. Qulgg has to make a bluff for the sake of appearances, and in his letter to Mr. Ver eance, offering to reorganize by nnd by, he saye: "We take tho view that we are a per? fectly regular and well Intending orgniilzn "tlon." Nevertheless. Mr. Qulgg knows perfectly well that tho constitution has been violated In the refusul to submit the rolls to Inspection. In the failure to publish notices required by the constitution whenever such notices threatened to Interfere with the plans of "the Master," and In neglect to dissolve the hundreds of as? sociations which the constitution, declares dead. Of course, he protends the machine Is regu? lar, but he knows It Is all pretence. If lu? la sincere In his offers of future reorganisation why should he care about the regularity of this one? If the new committee Is to be Died only as a vehicle for a new one It can make no difference whether its technical regularity la preserved or not. But If the game Is to hold the old organization In hope that tho demand for reform will quiet down, then the anxiety Is perfectly explicable. But In that case Mr. Qulgg should find stronger claims to regularity than ? single act of obedience to a constitu? tion that be has already punched full of holes. THE HAYTIAS INCIDENT. Oermauy nets less hnrshly In America than In Asia. Perhaps that Is because the provoca? tion Is less. Two of her subjects were actually killed In China. Por that she not merely de? manded an indemnity, but she sent a strong force to seize an important place on the Chinese coast, which she means to hold not merely until an indemnity is paid, but permanently. Hayii, on the other hand, merely arrested and Impris? oned a German subject for alleged Infraction of Haytlan law. For that Germany demanded an Indemnity and an apology, and to hasten the giving of them sont a couple of warships to Port au Prince, to bombard that place unless full satisfaction were rendered within eicht hours. The Haytlan Government reckoned dis? cretion the better part of valor, and yielded to overwhelming force, and the incident is now closed. There may be a postludi; in the form of a revolution against the Haytlan Govern? ment for thus yielding, but thnt, as Mr. Kip? ling says, Is snother story. Domestic ructions are rot of International concern. Now. Id all this Germany has done only what great Powers are In tho habit of doiDg to Siai-s that are too weak to resist them. Bui neither might nor yet mere usage can make right. Let It be granted, for sake of argument, thnt Herr Luedfrs waa unjustly Imprisoned. That fact has not been established by any Impartial tri? bunal. Let it be granted that he Is entitled to compensation for his Injuries. The amount due to him has not been Judicially determined. At first $50,000 was demanded; at last ;>2<M100 was accepted. Was tho original claim unjustly large? Or is the man now content with lesn than what he should justly get? These are questions which should be answered, uuless the world is to return to the age of violence, In which every man took what he could, without regard to tho law of mine and thlue. If Herr Lueders had been in prison, Buffering indigni? ties, or in danger of death, there would have been reason for peremptory demands for his re? lease or prompt trial, backed up. if necessary, with all the force of the G-rrnan Empire. But since be was out of trouble, and at ease and comfort, and since Haytl was nnchored fast and not able to abscond and avoid payment of Just claims, It certainly Meati that Germany might belter have gone about the matter In a fashion savoring somewhat less of "your money or your life." The mil import of Germany's conduct may best be perceived by supposing the offender to have been not Haytl. but some great Power. If a German subject wen? arrested and imprisoned In New-York, and (?crninii.v deemed such action unjust, would the Imperial Government assess damages against the United States according to its own pleasure, and send warships to bom? bard this city If full satisfaction were not given within so many hours? It Is simply Inconceiva? ble. No nation rustles Into war in that fashion. There would be diplomatic negotiations, an j earnest attempt to r.'itch a Just conclusion, and, I If necessary, reference to an impartial tribunal j of arbitration. Why should not Haytl have been treated In the same way? For no other conceivable reason than that Haytl is not a great Power, and is not able to resist the force Germany can send against her. There is no use In saying that such controversies could j not arise between two great Powers, and that It Is only the small ones that thus offeud. Not a year pass??? In which they do not arise be- I twten great Powers. Some Italians were mur? dered by a New-Orleans mob, but Italy did not send warships to collect self-assessed Indem? nity. Hungarians were killed by a Sheriff's posse in Pennsylvania, but no cruisers ramo hither from Trieste. The only conclusion to bo drawn Is thnt groat Powers deal In one way with oa<h other and in another way with every one else; ihnt there is one international law for the str.mg and another f >r th? weak. That system Is radically unJtisL It work?, and may coni ?nue to work for a time. Euro? pean Powers may despise the "half-brood" and "nigger" republics of Oentrsd and South Amer? ica, Just as In ante beUnm. days every pro-sla? very argument ended with "Well, damn tho Digger, nnyhow!" Hut the line between great Powen and small is not to be tnnthcmatlcnlly defined. If injustice can be meted out to the smallest State, why not to th? on? next larger? And if so, where is the process to stop? There must be a reign of law nil the way to the bot? tom of the s.-alo, or a rel^n of brut?? fom all the wny to the top, In the end the former will l?e found not only tn?? mor?? boi arable, but the ?;."G? safe and profitable, even f..r si? mighty a Power as Gernii.ny. The Haytian Incident is closed OH t!i" BUrfs ?. But ne tlier it nor any such will over be perfectly concluded until the possibility of such violent settlements is done aerar with. At tho very moment when Ihe German gun? wer? being mads readj to train on Port su Prince the President of the ? ? led States ?a* declaring inni "the best "sentiment of the civilised world is moving "toward ihe settlement of differences between "ija'ii.t.-i v. linoni resorting to tbe horrors of "wiir" it li Impossible not to beli.?'..? that the Words of the American statesman wire more creditable than the mission of the Germini ?rarsblpe. Th? ?nii'iiinc?m>nt that ?G.,???.??? more Is needed to complete the Improvements of the car.a.1? rather overcloud? the pros peel fora mon? ument to the men who built them. -?

He la the last man in the whole peninsula to lead a revolt against the Piedmont dynasty. If the men engr.ged In the six-day bicycle contest are contented with their prospects of glory and cash perhaps nobody else haa a right to complain. But the spectacle of such misery as they are destined to suffer before the end comes Is one which the community could well dispense with. If some London newspapers were betrayed Into unfair commenta on the President's Message l>y the meagrenes? of the summary which reached them, they have reason to regret that they did not make adequate arrangements to obtain what they required. If they had sufficient material for a Just Judgment, they have reaeon to be ashamed of the prejudice which Inspired their criticisms. One of the most Interesting candidacies of re? cent years for the French Academy is that of It Krnest Daudet. His worth Is not to be doubted. But the spectacle of a brother of the author of "L'Immortel" seated among the Forty would be one to pique curiosity and stimulate Imagination In a high degree. -f Mr. David Christie Murray no doubt means well In promoting th^ plan to erect a statu? of Washington In London; but wo do not want It there, and there Is no reason to suppose that London does. It knows quite well how? to honor the name and memory of the immortal man, "the greatest, last and best, the Cincinnatile of the West," as her great poet has called him, without th? reminder of an effigy. The statue fitly placed, like the word fitly spoken, may b? compared, if it is a good one, to apples <>f goui in pictures of silver. Otherwise it das not de servs so gracious a similitude, it La quits true that the nams of Washington adds dignity and nobility to the human race, and that not Stan the peerless State which he founded has a rlpht to a monopoly of his glory or the statues ?.?hi/ u aivm U. Lr.iniiiHiiiuiii. Tha lattur cannut be pronounced out of order anywhere where valor and civic virtue and the most stainlesa fame in history are honored, but there are no particular or urgent reasons for setting one up In London, aa there an no objections to It so long as the Initiative and all that relates to the work belong to the English themselves and are expressive of their own spontaneous sentiments. But, as a delicate point of propriety may be involved, it will be best to leave the matter en? tirely to them. _

Mr. Daly has added to the stock of harmless pleasure by producing In his theatre, apparently with a special view to tho holiday festival now im? minent, a morry farce called "Number Nine; or, The Lady of Ostend." This work has been "con? voyed" from the German of Messrs. Blumenthal and Kadelberg, by F. (.'. Burnand, the Editor of the London "Punch." Its scheme us"s> old materials with a dexterity of manipulation that makes them seem to be new. und, by a d? ft posture of comical situations, courront In rapid succession, present? a theme for laughter. It Is foolery, neither more nor less, but It Is bright foolery, and It affords an agree? able contrast to the more serious eIran.atic works with Which Mr. Daly's theatre has lonpr. been hon? orably identified. Its va ue to the public is that of "merriment, which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life." It enlists the talents of ten of the principal members of Mr. Daly'a company, and It was acted with exhilarating animation and brilliant effect. The several familiar types ot character that recur In this fares are the frolicsome young husband, who Is still fond of his bache or companions; the exi? gent young wife, who Is resentful of his fancied neglect; the cheerful, carelees msl<j friend, who la willing to be the scapegoat for marital pranks; the sober father-in-law, from the country, who be? comes frisky on his arrival In town, and the for? midable mother-in-law, who regulates everybody and everything within the radius of her family cir? cle A fresher type Is a cockney boxer, or "slug? ger." jealous In nature and prompt in action. The fabric of comic situation, at first, Is dependent on the young husband's ^abortive endeavor to shift upon a" friend the responsibility for his nocturnal p veis and ?ate hours. In subioiquent scenes It de? pends upon the Inopportune revelation, by tho cine? matograph, of a picture that was surreptitiously mane of him, when he chanced to be Idly and foot? I Ushly flirting with a young woman, on the beach at Ostend. The lady of the picture marries the 'slugger." and it Is understood to have been a part of her occupation to obtain, by Innocent though furtive means, a series of socla.ly representative pictures, for the cinematograph. The discomfiture of the husband, when this picture has been dis? closed. 1? naturally Intensified by his dread of the vengeful pugilist, and thereupon he promotes the comic confusion by causing his own portrait to be withdrawn, while first that of his friend, and after war i that of his father-in-law is put In its place. More particular rehearsal of these triviali? ties would resemble a dilation upon the huea of the butterfly. The farce employs many good old ex? pedients.?having recourse to the "Conjugal Les? son." "Mr?. Othello," and other source? of sport; and. as may readily be surmised. If not precisely a thing of beauty. It certainly Is a Joy for the hour. It l? written smoothly, and, In the character? of Edward Blake and Mllly Grace, with an occasionai ripple of wit and even with a suggestion of senti? ment. It was exceedingly well received; it made a hit with the house; and It ought to hold it? place for some time. The most Intrinsically amusing character la "Number Nine" seem? to be that of Toby Krock? et t. which was played by Mr. Joseph Herbert. This part requires a prtze-ring equipment and a cockney dialect, and it enables the actor to re? produce very much the Ideal that Dicken? must have bad In mind, when he delineated the Immortal Chicken. In "Dombey and Son." Mr. Joseph Her? bert,-who shows a keen instinct for character, to? gether with a Just and light tauch in the portrayal of It,?made that figure remarkably distinct and emphatically humorous. Mr. Charles Rlchman, mak? ing his first appearance since his return from Eng? land, and acting In a vein of more than usually fluent humor, presented a vivacious Irish gentle? man, who gets Into trouble for his friend's sake? and fais In love for his own; and he was wel corned with cordiality and rewarded with admire? tlon. The father-in-law fell to William Owen; thl mother-in-law to Mrs. Gilbert; and the broad, comi? style of the one. contrasting with the crisp. Incisivi methol of the other, made those parts sharply ef? fective. It would be expecting too much to expect again such exceptional results of mirth aa com? monly followed upon the acting of Mrs. Gilbert and tho late James Lewis, In theatrical situations such as largely constitute this farce. Mr. Lewis waa dry; Mr. Owen Is unctuous and JovlaJ;?and whether the humor proceeds from his personality or from his avt, he Is the cheery cause of most enjoyable mirth. Miss Irene Perry, who made her first appearance at this theatre, playing the Jealous, quizzical, satirical young wife, haa abundant ani? mal spirits, buoyant demeanor, a winning voice, a genial, merry temperament, the dash of the ?come? dian, and that ireeiom of graceful action which creates the effect of npontanelty. Ml?? Lilla Con? vere gave a blithe, mischievous performance of a cockney servant. This occasion was signalized by the first ap? pearance of Mis? Lettlce Fairfax, a young actress from the London stage, whose personal beauty, combined with distinction and a piquant demeanor, Imparted a most agreeable sense of character and refinement. It seema probable that Miss Fairfax will galo valuable success In the Une of ing?nue characters from which Miss liehan has advanced to Shakespearian comedy. Mr. Cyril Scott played the volatile young husband, acting In that brisk and breezy manner which has heretofore com? mended him to public favor; and Mr. William Hazcltlne and Mr. Deane Pratt.?two ac'ors who are Invariably zealous end scrupulously earnest,? were efficient snd agreeable. In minor characters. The absence of Miss Rehan from the cast la a temporary loes to the public and a disadvantage to the play; but, there Is no part for Miss Rehan In "Number Nine"; she Is In need of repose, having acted with scarcely the Intermission of a night for many month?; ?ne Is shortly to reappear, and to present Portia, In "Tho Merchant of Venice"; and the community may well be pleased that ?he Is allowed the benefit of a brief respite from con? tinual and arduous labor.
