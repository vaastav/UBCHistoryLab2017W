T1,E SITUATION. The reeonnoissances made on Friday and the few previous days, in the direction of Fairfax Court Mouse and I'ohick church, have failed to discover thi enemy in that direction. General Smith's divi sion was out yesterday, in the neighborhood of Vl emia, 0IJ a foraging party, and brought in no lew than ninety-four wagon loads of provisions. The accounts published from rebel sources, rela tive to the appearance of some sixteen vessels of the Union licet inside tlie bar at the entrance to Savannah, which we published yester day, may bo quite true; but the rebel idea that they formed part of Commodore Duponfs squadron admits of some doubt. It is true that Com. Dupont, being a sldlfni naval officer, and knowing the value' of seizing ?P,n Fort Pulaski, may have despatched ? portion o! hi, fl,, t to that point. It i(j certain that he could easily have done so, from the position he occupies at Port Royal and Tybcc l.-laud; but, nevertheless, the sixteen vessels seen at the mouth of the Savannah river may prove to be the advance of the stone fleet, destined to block up the en trance to that city. In either event, whether they are a part of Commodore Dnpoat'a squadron, or Commodure Chadwick'a stone fleet, (he fate of .Savannah is sealed. It is pretty certain, however, i that hey compri.se a portion of iho .stone fleet, us the Savannah Republican of the 5th instant de scribes them as ing old whalers, iu connection with lhi; intelligence, we give to-day an excellent map of the position of Fort Pulaski, and the key to Savannah, together with the range of the gun and the disposition of the fleet at the entrance. By way of Fortress Monroe wo have news of a tight which took place on the morning of Friday last, at Ilattoras Inlet, between tin Union gun boats Underwiter. Stars and Stripes, Putnam, Ceres and Spaulding, and two heavily armed rebel gun boats. Between twenty aud thirty >bots were ex changed without doing any damage. A heavy gale prevailed at Ilattoras on the 2d, but did no damage to the fortifications. Further efforts appear to be on foot to open commercial communication with the reclaimed portions of the rebel seacoast. Some time ago we heard ol the enterprise of Sennt >r Simmons, of Jihode Island, to Hatteras, with a view to trade Jor cotton, ind tran.-niit the same to Europe. It is eaid that an application was made to Collector Barney yestu day to obtain clearances from this port for several schooners to Accomac and North- j onipton counties, Virginia, which have recently come under the Star :,nd Stripes: but the Collector had not yet received instructions from the govern ment to grant clearances to these points. U e K arn by di spatches in the Memphis papers, from Iticlimond, that the rebel General J'rice has i beeu superseded in his command of the di.-trict of Missouri by General Heath, of Virginia. The rebels are now threatened on all sides, to an extent which causes considerable quaking through, out the whole Southern confederacy. Our latest j Intelligence, in a small compass, is about as fol- j lows: ? 1. Columbus, Ky., is to be taken. 2. Memphis, Tenn., will be bombarded and re duced. 3.

Senator Ti'iiiabiill on Conlt*callon of tin Property of Traiturn. The speech of Senator Trumbull in tin- United ' States Senate, which wc published on Friday, j introducing hid bill for the coclise. tionofall the ' property of rebels, including slaves, has some j features in it which are deserving of coinnienda- j (ion, such as his assertion of the following ; principles: ? That the war for the restoration of ! ilif I uion oiiu,ht to beconductod strictly within ! the limits of the constitution; that if it is j conducted otherwise there is no difference be- ' tween the guilt of the United Slates govern ment and that of the insurgents: that the eon sti union, with consummate wisdom, aiuply provid-s for every emergency: that if it may be transcended by the Executive on the plea of necessity, which is always ihe tyrants plea, i, is of no value whatever, and consequently the object for which oar armies are lighting would be lost: that the military power in war is not superior to the civil power, but snbor. dinate to it. and that Congress is the war making power, and can control the army and ? I* operations, the Chief Magistrate, as Com mander in-Chief, having only the right to cany out the will of Congress, unless in Hm-h in stance* as he is left to his own discretion, and where the laws of Congress and the con-dilution do not restrict him; and. lastly, that martin, law cannot override civil law. or even exist in districts of the country where there jN no insurrection. This is nil true as far us it goe?: bit! the speech of the Senator from Illinois is singular lv inconsistent, self contradictory, and. like all the -pc?" lies of the radical abolitionists, is visionarv imPra?ticaW?. lie proposes to carry on the war strictly within the bounds of the con stitution. and yet his own bill violate, it in the most flagrant manner. For instance. l,e N,vs ir is constitutional to establish martial law for civilians who are citizens of the United state in the insurrectionary districts. We should like to know where hetind<this in the conni tution? If he will look into it carefully he will find, on the contrary, that martial law ia expressly barred, even in Ihe case of citizens guilty of treason, and can be only applied to the members of the army, nary and militi.,. when in active service. The amendments to the constitution are the bill of rights adopted by the people in addition to that instrument, to "make n-surance doubly sure. ?nd take a bond of fate'" that theif liberties should never be trodden down under any pre tence. Article filth of those amendments de clares:? -No person shall beheld to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in ca-ms arising in the laud or nawi forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger; ? ? ? nor be do prived (.r lift., liberty or property without <luo procoiM of law." Tliiut the application of niar-^ tifil law is strictly confined to offences in the nrniy an<l navy, and only to persons therein when in actual service in time of war or public danger. The critno of treason or insurrection in no exception. Article throe, Hection two, of the constitution declares that '"the trial of all crimcs (of civilians), except in cases of impeach ment, shall be by jury, und such trial shall be hold in tho State where the said crimes shall have been committed." And tho next section of the samo article runs as follows:? "Treason against tbeUniied States shall oonsist only in levying v\ Ui fi/uiuot, thcin, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. The Congress shall have power to declare tho punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall tfhrk corruption of blood, or for feiture, except during the life of the person attainted." It is clear, therefore, that the military have no power to deal with traitors, except to kill them on the Held of battle, or take them prisou ers in aid of the civil pow er, and hand them over to the s-enie to be dealt with by the civil law. lly an old law of Congress the penalty afllxed to treason is death. Uut forfeiture of property was nover thought of till the present war, and would not be now but for tho treacherous purpose of getting hold of the* slaves by a side wind. Mr. Trumbull's bill for feiting traitors' property to the United States "forever" is clearly against the plain provisions of the constitution already quoted, also those provisions which expressly declare that neither Congress nor any State shall pass a bill of attainder or ex post facto law. (Article 1, sec tions 9 and 10.) Mr. Trumbull's bill is a bill of attainder and nothing else. It forfeits the pro perty in the case of the innocent children, at tuintiijg them as well as tho guilty parent, con trary to the intention of the constitution. Con gress might have made the punishment of trea son imprisonment for ten or fifteen years and forfeiture of property during life ; but as the punishment is doatb, and as the forfeiture can not take place till after the conviction in a civil court, and as death follows immediately after, the forfeitur e, as the law now stands, practically umounts to nothing: for the moment nfter the execution of the traitor his property belongs to his heirs ; for, says the constitutiou, "No attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted." Mr. Trumbull's bill 1 makes a distinction between real estate and 1 chattel property, including slaves. lint the ' constitution knows no such distinction ; and the slaves and other effects of a rebel slain in battle, or arrested, convicted and executed by j process of civil law, belong as much to his wife ! and children as his houses and lands, no matter ' what law may be made to the contrary by Con- 1 gre.-s. Mr. Trumbull admits that, in modem j civilized warfare the private property of a lion- i combatant alien enemy is exempt in practice ! from confiscation, but insists that the theoretical i iig.it remains, and, u fo/liui'i, the j i^'ht to c* * ?n - ? tisc ite the property of an insurgent. Now it 1 is precisely the reverse, because the coiwitii j tion. which Mr. Trumbull professes to respect i deprives tbe government of the right 'it the case of Aniorlcau citizens, but not inthec i e I of a foreign nation. Nor will the argument hold water that, because desperate rebels wrongfully confi.-cuto the property w( Luion men, our government ought to violate the con stitution and follow their example. 1 he generals of the army have no right, there fore, to sei/.e slaves or other property in the^ Southern States except where they are directly used in military or naval operations; and then they may legitimately use those slav es "n making trenches and in other military service, except the lolh afld barbarity of arming them, and that without the authority of Congress, it being a right incidental to war; but the generals have no power to set them tree, nor has Congress itself the right to do it. To emancipate the slaves would be io forfeit the properly forever to the heirs of the traitor; and to forfeit his property, even as against the traitor himself, could only tie done legally and constitutional! \ after his conviction in court. Nor is there any I right given by the constitution to transport | them out of the country, nor yet to send them ' to freeze at the cold North. Ihe slaves, therefore, taken in the service of ! the insurgent army, or who have be- ' come fugitives, ought to be retained till ! after Ihe war. so that the rights and claims of the owners may be investigated. But in no ca?c ought they to be emancipated. South Carolina or Georgia or any other State ni.iv emancipate it-* slaves: but Congress has no >ur>h power. This was admitted even in the Chicago l'latform. Suppose Congress were to pass n general act of emancipation. -itch as the Tribune ' proposes, practically P would amount to ' nothing: for. after tl>.? termination of the war. and the submission of the rebellious States, tliev would have a right to re-enact slavery, and ' Congress could not interfere with them. Even i as a war measure it. is absurd, and it would tie I just as rational to pass an act that the President I hang Jefferson Davis in six weeks. The I'resi- I d?nt must first catch him before he put * hi- neck ' in a noose. Not only is emancipation impracti- i cable, but it would be highly impolfcie. It I would qneucli every spark of Union sentiment ! at t lie South: and without the develnpera in of^ Southern loyalty the war would be hopeless j and interminable. 1! would aUo divide the North, and be a wet blanket on the enthusiasm I of Union democrats, without whose support the ' war cannot be conducted to a successful tenni nation. To change the issue from a war for the I Union to a war for the abolition of slavery 1 would be fatal to our hopes. The object of the : abolitionists in Congress and out of ii appears to be to embarrass the President because of his conservatism, and to prevent the success of the war for the Union, the constitution and tbe laws. 1 The Naivkk of Mahox and Suihxi/s Mk&?aoe ; to Knui.and. ? It will be recollected by our ! readers that in n long and elaborate article we I pnbli.->Led from tlie Charleston Mtr< ?< ry, written before tlio a n est of MaSon and Slidcil, the character of their mission was refined to as 1 one of small importance. But now ' at they are safely eaged in Kort Warren, the same paper, j may have been seen by an extract we pub- I lished yesterday, declares the very contrary. It says " they were the bearers of probably the most magnilicent offers of friendly and lu crative intercourse which have over passed from another people to England." Just so! and this proves the importance of tho arrest by Captain Wilkes. Jt is <juite in keeping with the hint in the message of Governor Pickens that ' democracy was u failure, iaid the declarations of some of the other ohlefa of the rebellion, that' if all failed, they would place the Confederate States u dor the protect<yate of England rather than mi'" *r their subjugation by Uir federal go" veromont. Tlx* V'oolal Rjrutenia of (lie United Rtiitca 11 tul FiigiumWriit Anuuul Report** We reocivod, by a curious coincidence, in Wednesday's mail from Washington, and hi the transatlantic mail on the name day, botli the an nual report of our own l'oat Office and the an nual roport of the Postmaster General of Grc.it Britain. An abstract of Postmaster Blair's re port appeared in the 1Ikbam> of Wednesday, with the President's Message. The report in full whb given in yesterday's paper, and will well repay perusal. This report evinces care and thoughtfulness, with a determi nation on the part of our new Postmas ter General to do full justice to the interests of the people In the administration of the Im portant department over which he presides. The recommendations of changes in the postal laws are few, and, in the main, judicious. Mr. Postmaster Blair is a graduate of West Point, and, as one of the constitutional advisers of tho President in a most unprecedented period, has been largely occupied during his few months of office in aiding and assisting the President in Cabinet council to bring the rebellion within the grasp of our land and naval forces. That has now been accomplished, and with the return of the revolted States and the ap proach of peace Mr. Blair will have room for the exercise of all his abilities and all his un tiring industry in reorganizing our broken pos tal arrangements and aiding our legislators in accomplishing much needed postal improve ments. The Postmaster General knows that the country is quite unanimous in the opinion that our postal system is one of the most miserable in the civilized world, and that very many of the inconveniences under which we labor would have been removed by legislation years ago but for the clogs and opposition interposed by some of the inglorious ciphers who were his predecessors in office. We need a Postmaster General from one of our large Eastern cities, and" it is some improvement to have one ap pointed from the vicinity of Washington or ihil timore, rather than go to the backwoods of Ken tucky or Tennessee, to a benighted region of Pennsylvania, or have thrust upon us a misera ble piece of red tape tint has long been without strength, color or substance. Perhaps, how ever. we have no more reason to complain of either the bead or tail of Buchanan's adminis tration, a s represented in this department, thun w e iia\e of the maladministration in every other. Getting the Post Office four or five mil lions in debt is a smell crime compared to the embezzlement of national or Indian bonds by the million, and the stealing of aims sufficient tu enable the conspirators to hold the power of the nation and five hundred thousamlmen at bay throughout a long and bloody campaign. The former ( irete management of this great depart ment has given the present iticumbi nt .1 better opportunity to distinguish himself by the linking contrast that we hope to see in his management, as eompn ed to nt le ;st four of his immediate but by no means illustrious predo cissor?. But we will not anticipate, ff Mr. Blair is the man of business we believe him to be, we shall soon see the good results of hi* energy and ability. We are particularly di>sirous that he should see the important part that this State and more densely populated and commercial portions of the country play in the tilling of the colTers of his department. Ho may not bo aware that New York eity contributes one-tenth, the State of New York one-fifth, and New 1 o> !<. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania forty per cent 0! the entire correspondence anil postal revenue of tlie country. By facts like these tlv: head of ihe J'ost Office learns two important items. lie sees what communities have the j largest interest in tho postal establishment and ! where he must go to stimulate correspondence 1 and increase tho revenue of his department Fourteen of tho Interior and planting u:e- of the South and Southwest write no more letters and pay no more postal revenue than the State of New York alone, while a real improve ment lilvO thai of a uniform and low rate of postage, with greater facilities for collecting 1 and delivering letters in cities and largo towns, : would double the postal receipts in n di. rt J time in a commercial community like that of ! New ^ ork. We are rejoiced to see that the Poster: - < -r j General has recommended the return of all , dead letter to the writers, except printed oir- ' culars, those that are anonymous or those evi- < dently worthless. A letter is property, and by 1 its return to the writer, when not delivered to the person addre -ed, serves this valuable purpose, that it informs the one sending il ilmt it lui^- never reached its destination. We think, I however, that all extra charges on letters, in ' addition io tho rate originally levied, is a most , needle- * complication, ami one that stands in 1 tho way ot that system of uniformity and sim- | plieity w ithout which there cannot be a good postal establishment. The charging a rate of a ; few cents, the collecting of the rate l>v the post- 1 master who receives and delivers the dead let ter to the writer, the putting of tho recipient | to ihe trouble of taking out his money to pay so small a sum. and then parting with the sum, all make tip a series of taxes on time and ; > means that are not compensated for by the few thousands obtained. In Great Ilritain a letter starts from the hand j of the writer, and. whether it is delivered as di rected, or forwarded from one place to another, oris returned as a dead letter to the place j whence it, started, it has 110 tax 011 it beyond l" the original prepaid rate. This all comes even j in a general average, and leaves the postal ma chinery more simple and more easily carried on by both the public and the postal authorities and clerks. It is not essential or at all " important j that each letter and other document should pay | its exact proportion of expense and trouble- a j clear impossibility- but it is essential that there | should be such a rate of postage and such uni- j fortuity as will give the needed revenue with | the least number of taxes and charges on the j documents sent by mail. The vexed question of compulsory prepay ment comes up in numerous shapes. It is re commended that a note be went to all who have letters addressed to them without being pro paid, and, on getting the answer with a stamp in a prepaid letter, to forward it. Why not abolish the compulsory prepayment alto gether, an l charge doublo postage, and thus get the same sum for carrying and delivering ono letter that is now reoeived for three. ! The Postmaster General very rightly ?iks Cougrnss ti> uso the power of the government in obtaining carriage for postal matter on rail ways at compensating and not exorbitant rates. We hope it will bo done. The badly mixod up system of carriers' fees, extra pennies and partial deliveries in cities are commented upon; but 110 good result can pos sibly eoine out of it till some stronp hand cuts the Gorrtian knot, by establishing one uniform rate for both drop letters and thoe that go the longest distances. Now, in regard to the report of the Tost" master General of Groat Britain, we see a curi ous and instructive contrast to the workings of our own postal establishment. Lower charges, great simplicity and convenience, largo profits, and an onormouB use of the poBtal maohinery. that wo arc utter strangers to. One thing they do not have in Great Britain. They do not have over two hundred and fifty different rates of postage on transient printed matter, in pack ages weighing not over one pound and a half, the rates levied with a subtloty that would drive a Philadelphia lawyer mad, or make a. Jesuit hang himself or forget all his vows. We have the luxury of studying, consulting and using a quarter of a thousand rates on printed matter, before getting up in the scale above the size of an ordinary duodecimo volume, while the Bri tish people have just four different rates on the same matter. We see in this last report from St. Martin's le Grand the usual records of the progress of the establishment that was created by the magi cal touch of Sir Rowland Ilill. The British public sent by mail during the year 564,000,000 letters, or at least three times as many as were sent through the post offices of the United States, with its reputation of having a better educated population than any other nation in the world. There were 71,000,000 newspapers, and 11,700,000 book packets. Nearly two million of dead letters are returned to the writers ? they call them "returned'' let ters. as they are not suffered to die on their hands as ours do and these are sent back with out any charge whatever. The totul income of the British Post Office was $16,910,000 with a clear profit to the treasury of over $7,300,000. Our postal authorities and postal committees will please remember that the actual cost ? labor ? of handling, receiving and de livering the letters that circulate in Great Britain ? omitting expenses of transportation ? is not greater than the handling one-third the number with us, owing to the uniformity and simplicity of their rates and other arrangements.

Beyond any reasonable doubt, the "chaiac- , tors" in this '?curious book" are of the same stamp | as tho'C which Mrs. Stowe describes. As their | ??ronium e" is "mysterious to the outside world." i! in ,st be of "that inner life which cometh not with observation:" and perhaps Mrs. Muwe would be willing to submit lliis "curious book' to those -dear children'' who she so affection ately addressed, and whom she hopes may long "be able to l>e pleased with child's stories." i S lories of "old men's darlings" might suit children, Mrs. Stowe. Under the heading, "What Shall be Done With the Body?" a my- Tiott:- question, which, perhaps, the ii'l'nts "curious book" might an- wer ? the Rev. George J?. Cbeever. re cently returned from pacing around the abo lition saucer in England, writ 's ;> long article about "higher responsibility" and "moral cl. itus." This "curious book," which the I?Jt advertises, nnd which the Rev. Mr. Cliec ver luts doubtless attentively p rused. treats of these topics in a manner which apparently satis fies the reverend gentleman. The "moral ; claims" of "city women'' cannot be too often urged, and Ihc "higher responsibility" of ad vertising accounts ami portraits of "confidence women, adventuresses, ladies of pleasure and dashing willows" must be left to the considera tion of the public and the grand jury. fu an article upon the refusal of the London Star to notice Reade's now novel ? "The Cloister and the Hearth" ? and of the consequent with drawal of the advertisement# of that work, tin Independent editors design to excuse theinwolveS for not having this week nn editorial puff of the "curioiw book" upon "city women." They state, however, that "editors are predisposed to be favoruble toward" authors and publishers, m oolaborers in the cause of literature and tbe education of the people." Now, this "curious book" imparts much information upon subject# "mysterious to the outside world," and there fore, according to the Independmi's views, is ft "eoluborer in the cause of the education of the people." Though the "education" is not of tha* sort which most people of "the outside world* prefer, it doubtless appears valuable to such ini tiated folks as the Independent editors, and wo expect them to have an article upon it next week, recommending it to their readers. Tho versatile pen which dashes ofi' essays upon "tho ext.' nt uf the atonement" might make clear the point whether the atonement extends to thoso who a: sist in circulating such a "curious book." The Rev. Horace Greeley, who writes in a white coat for the Tribune and a white choker for tho Independent, has beon too busy lately, with gambling debts, bets on the charter eleo* tion, and the delightful and exhilarating pastime of "seven up," to "do" his usual article for the religious abolition organ this week. There cannot be the slightest doubt that he endorses the views of tho "curious book," however, and perhaps his ne glect to contribute to the Independent this week was owing to the fact that ho bad been engaged, in the solitude of his chambcr, in perusing thoao "mysterious" facts about "city women" for which the book is famous. But Greeley always father any idea of the Independent's, and par rades it in the Tribune as a bran new inventioa of his own. Indeed, it is currently reported that the Independent and the Tribune are ono concern; that the waste article* of the one aro printed in the other, and that by taking tho combined circulation of the two papers Greeley managed to arrive within some thousands of tho*e numbers with which he used to bo wilder his readers, and upon which ho base* tho bogus bets he offers us. It is perhaps more reasonable to suppose, however, that Greeley hus not yet recovered from the brain fever ho caught at Manassas Junction, and really imagines that the ideas he borrows from tho Independent are his own. And so we leave him with his "city women." Tho Rev. llenry Ward Beecher justifies his conduct in advertising this "curious book" by tho H: sertion, in bis sermon, that >;maa is not an isolated creature;" and perhaps the reverend divine thinks that the company of "old men's darlings, ladies of pleasure and dashing widows" is preferable for young men and middle a^ed bachelors to the isolation of solitude. An old proverb says that "a poor ex. cu.se is belter than none:" and so we present Beecher's case in its v? ry berft light. If, in his case, or in that of any of the other personages of the Independent's start', there t-hould seem to 1^ an irrecc.iiVile.il ile eoiimet between their princi* pies and their practice ? the piety they profess ard tho prostitution they advertise ? we have only to say that they belong to tho new Satanlo abolition school of morals, and tli.it the IndepetC dad is the organ of that school. It occurs to us, how ever, that, in deference to a strong op posing public opinion, the reverend Indepehrkni clique ought either tu give up preaching and slop their "religions newspaper," or else relin qn; h tbei< agei'ey for this very "curious book." Tun 11i.asi uk.mv of thr Titmt nk. ? In a long oditmial article in yesterday's Tribune, one o* tlie plJlosopbers of that infidel sheet labors to prove that neither divine nor human law is obligatory on man, and the writer places the Holy Gospels and (he Pentateuch on the same level with (lie religion of Odin and the faith of Mohammed, nnd the constitution and laws of the United States on the same level with the Puritan law* against witchcraft and the bloody edict* of ITeury VIM. and Piano. So, because there have b < 11 bad laws . and false religions, therefore t hrislianity and the Bible and the mild and beneficent constitution and laws of the United States are of no authority, and ought to be overthrown. in favor of the Satanio dogma oi',-a higher law," the very same princi ple on which th<> arch rebel lifted the standard j of revolt again --t the Almighty in Jlenven. The I reasoning of Greeley & Co. would lead to endless confusion, and to robbery, murder and every crime. If every man may (to what seems : rL'lil in his own eyes. there is an end of the so l ciai lauric. Ill irj'cting the authority oflunda ! mental law, Greeley ignores God himself, the ?'Mat lawgiver, and lt?- does so because the ible. equally in -the Old Tostament and the i New . sanctions the domestic institution of slave ry. under the regulation of moral and religious principles. As without fixed law tho uni verse would relapse into chaos, so it is in the body politic. Human government, without law, ran only be either cruel despotism or tierce anarchy: and to one or other of these unhappy conditions the abolition philosophers are labor* iirrli.r. d to precipitate a nation which, hut for their diabolical principles, would be now hap py. prosperous and at pe.ice with all tho v.orld.
