The public dobt statement from the treasury department shows an increase in the debt during November , amount ing to $11,199,817. Treasury disburse ments have been unusually large during November , the pension pa3'ments alone amounting to $21,675,000 , against but $4,250,000 in October , while receipts from all sources fell off $2,500,000 as compared with the receipts of the month previous. The net or surplus cash in the treasury to-day is $52,234,010 , against S74,491,969 , on November. The interest bearing debt has been reduced $11,000,000 during the month and now aggregates $947,06.8,202. The gold fund balance has increased about $8,000,000 during the past month , and now aggre gates $199,339,133 , and the silver fund balance has decreased about $5,500,000 and to-da3 * amounts to $19,113,095. Na tional bank depositories to-da3 * hold $51,925,078 of government funds , or $2,500,000 Icbs than on November 1. Government receipts from all sources during November reached $28,590,106 , or nearly 4,000,000 less than during Oc tober past , and fully $500,000 less than in November , 1887 ; Customs receipts during November amounted to$15,284 , - 500 , about $500,000 less than in Novem ber , 1887.

Special Agent Jewell's Report. In his annual report Supervising Special Agent Jewell , of the treasury , states that the amount recovered and paid into the treasury through the direct services of tho officers and employes of his division exceeds the total cost of such services by $227,890. This is exclu sive of tho amount involved in suits , commenced and undetermined ; of re ductions of expenses recommended , and additions aggregating $683,311 to the in voice values of silk goods from France and Switzerland. In a discussion of the subject of jtn- der-valnations and false classifications he say : While the chief officers of customs at the principal ports have generally co operated heartily with the department in its efforts to enforce the laws and reg ulations in these regards , tho abuses mentioned continue. The unscrupulous Btill prosper at the expense of the pubUo revenue and of honest importers , and it is manifest that justice and equality at the custom houses cannot be secured to all interested without a radical revision of tho customs and revenue laws and a reformation of the existing administra tive methods and machinery. He states that the high duty on opium and the fact that it is easily smuggled , has made it a favorite object of traffic with those who wish to benefit by a violation of the rev enue laws. It is highly desirable that the recommendation of the department made last year for its seizure and de struction of the drug in that form where- ever found should be speedily passed by congress. Errors in tho Hotiso Journal. "Washington , Dec. 6. X congressional in vestigation will bo tho outcome of the recent discoveries of gro3B errors in the Journnl.of the bonso for last session. A resolution for the in vestigation has been prepared and will be pre- tonted In a day or two. Speaker Carlisle Is the flctim ' of one of the errors , and It Is such anln- > Bxcnsable and annoying one that he is said to ' " be quite exercised over it. When the Fiftieth congress met last December , Mr. Carlisle's 6cat In the house was contested. The speaker there fore declined to perform the duty of appointing . the committee on elections who were to sit as ludges npon his case , and , following an old pre cedent , tho committee was chosen by the. vote 3f the house. Tho Journal of last session , just ' printed , falls to make any note of this action , tiowever , but states that the speaker appointed ! nil the committees , including that on elections , rhts is a very grave mistake , as the precedent idopted by Mr. Carlisle ia a most important me , and the journal is the legal evidence of all congressional action , to tho exclusion of the Record and all other documentary testimony , fne speaker does not wish to bave it go into ilstory that he selected tho committee to puss lpon bis own title to a seat in the house. This irror is said to be but a sample of the many to > e found In the published Journal of tho last j leision. THE 

BOARD'S ANNUAL WINTER MEETING. The Coming Corn Jtxlitolt , Wtllt .Schedule 0/ VremUtm * and Conditions. The Nebraska state board of agricul ture holds its annual winter meeting at Lincoln , the capital of the state , under provision of law , commencing on the third Tuesday , January 15th , 1889. At this meeting 'tho annual corn exhibit is made. The past season having been propitious throughout tho state for this great staple product , the board desire and aim to presont tho best showing ever mado anywhere. This circular is issued early that the public may bo fully advised , aud that all interested may make the best .selections as they harvest their crop. This they are ur gently requested to do , and come to tho front with their offerings. As has been said before , we repeat : At our annual fair it is too early to show corn to an ad vantage. At tho season of the year the winter meeting is held , corn is dry and in position to be submitted to scientific tests by which tho nctual per cent yield can be obtained aud shown. This plan of judging corn , inaugurated last year , was productive of best and most satis factory results. It will bo soen pre miums are liberal and quantity small. While a minimum is fixed , no maximum is given. Exhibitors will bo allowed space for all they desire to exhibit. It is desirable that tho secretary be in formed early , as to entries and space wished for „ that accommodating pro visions may be made. The exhibit will bo held in one of the state university buildincs. Exhibits sent to the secre tary will be put in placo and cared for when parties can not attend in person. All exhibits should bo in placo on the 14th if possible , or tho morning of tho 15th at farthest. The superintendent and judges of exhibits will be appointed and announced in duo time. Each county and section of the state should be represented at this corn show. The following schedule of premiums aud conditions are presented and will prevail : Exhibits must be grown in Nebraska , the growth of 1888 , and have been grown by the exhibitor , or in the county com peting. Statements as to soil , manner of sav ing , preparing seed , and time of plant ing , mode of culture , and period of ma turity to accompany each entry. En tries to be made at any time before or on tho Saturday next preceding the first day of winter meeting. Premium corn to become the property of the board for distribution , or such other disposition as it may determine. 1'Ki.MHJMS. 1st 2d Pro.

This rule while it would be advantageous and desirable to both the exhibitors and the general ex hibit , does not , of obligation , apply to the collective exhibits. Collective ex hibits must ho separate nnd distinct from individual exhibits. Parties mak ing collective exhibits can enter and compete for minor individual premiums with same varieties of corn , but not the same specimens It will be seen that in collective exhibits a scientific test is not resorted to. It is simply "the largest nnmber of varieties aud best display. " Professional commercial seed growers or dealers are not permitted to compete for premiums. Every facility for _ ex hibiting will , however , be provided them , free of charge , and they are in vited to make exhibits. SCORE OF POINTS FOB EAR CORN.

It also provides for the ap pointment by the president of a heaith com mission , to be composed of twenty members , who sbail Dp divided in six sections , as follows : Five for the yellow fever section , and three each for the cholera , typhoid fever , scarlet fever , small-pox and diphtheria sections.

FOREIGN PAPERS ON THE MESSAGS What Leading JAmdon Jottrnalt Say oft Document , London specinl : The London Morn ing Post , commenting on tho president's , messago , says : "If America is really inclined to re sume negotiations on tho subject of tho fisheries , it will find tho English minis- tor animated only by a sincero desiro to promote tho final and satisfactory ad justment which Mr. Cleveland mentions. While unablo to hold the same opinion as Mr. Cleveland as to what the great demands of the country are. the Post thinks that it would be better if Eng land would look to the disposition of American statesmen in the future than to wrangle over the past , " The Daity News says that it would ex press more regret for Mr. Cleveland's acrimonious reference to the dismissal of Lord Sackville , if Lord Salisbury had not set the example. Mr. Cleveland , it thinks , evidently has Lord Salisbur3's fatal gift of a bitter tongue. In other respects tho messago seems to be tho most powerful performance which tho president has accomplished , namel3r , the feat of saj'ing something both new and true about protection. Tho Nows further remarks that tho message is likely to become a household word for tho orators of Hyde Park and Clerken- well. The fisheries question , it thinks , will have a smallar chance for settle ment under Mr. Harrison than under Mr. Cleveland , but , having ouly one great party to please , tho chances for the judgment on its merits may greatly improve. The Chronicle says : "President Cleveland uses strong but true language About protection. In regard to the Sackville matter , it is satisfying to find that he refers to it as an occurrence to be deepbregretted. . This is iu marked contrast to Lord Salisbury's flippant sarcasm. We hope that Lord Salisbury will consider it a sufficient reason to ap point a successor to Lord Sackville with out delay. " Tho Standard says : "President Cleve land's message might have been more gracious and dignified if he could only have effaced from his recollection the unsuccessful election coup which sullied an otherwise honorable record. Wo did not expect to find him repeating his original error to show that he is ashamed of himself. " After quoting references to tho Sackville matter in the message the Standard proceeds iu a similar strain through sentence after sentence of solemn froth. "Englishmen , " it says , can afford to laugh at such puerile nonsense. Even Americans will not pretend to take it in good earnest. Doubtless Lord Sackville was techni cally wrong , bur. Ministers Lowell and Phelps spoke tho same way , though not in the same degreee , scores of times in their addresses to Englishmen , which were read with much edification and not the smallest trace of resentment. " The Standard thinks the fisheries ques tion now has a chance of being settled. BY THE 

TELEGRAPH AND MAIL. Two factions of Chinese highbinders iudnlged in a murderous fight in the streets of Portland , Oregon. Trouble between the two crowds has been brew- iug for some time. Tliej' met and each began firing into the ranks of the other. The shooting lasted about ten minutes and resulted in the instantaneous death of one Chinaman , three others being fa tally and two seriously injured. "Parson" Davies , Jack Kilrain's man ager , was interviewed to the effect that Kilrain will fight John L. Sullivan with bare knuckles under the prize ring rules for So,000 a side within ten or twelve weeks. Bichard Iv. Fox , Kilrain's backer , said that Davies stands ready at any time to make the neccssarj * deposit , and Kilrnin is equally anxious to hear ' that Sullivan will agree to meet him. All employes other than train hands , yard men and men employed in hand ling tho motive power , of the Atlantic it Pacific railroad company , wero noti fied that those receiving over $50 per month would be reduced 10 per cent on their wages to date from November 1. Tho train dispatchers , operators , and all of the California division at once no tified the superintendent that unless wages were restored { they would stop work. The New York World's Woshington correspondent says : If Mr. Cleveland personally is much disappointed by the result of the election , he does not give any outward sign of it. He is even more brisk and cheerful in manner than at any time since he was elected presi dent. It would indicate him as entirely sincere in saj'ing that he looks forward to a return to private life with absolute pleasure. Superintendent E. L. Campbell , of the Wells , Fargo Express company at Kan sas city , received word of the arrest at Montgomery , Ala. , of Benjamin E. Allen , jr. , the messenger who absconded with several thousand dollars. He seut two packages to Cleveland , O. , and that office was wired to hold the packages , as it was supposed they contained part of the mone3r . Chicago dispatch : The general mana gers of tho east bound railway lines agreed at a meeting to-day to restore the rates on all classes of dead freight , in cluding grain and provisions , and to ad vance dressed beef rates to a basis of 50 cents a hundred pounds and live stock rates to 22V cents. The session lasted all day. The restoration of rates is do- la3-ed "five days longer than expected , the timo for the change to take place being December 17 , instead of Decem ber 12. The lines in the transcontinental asso ciation practically agreed at their meet ing in Chicago to make a change in the rates to the Pacific coast , in accordance with the desires of shippers , who have ; complained that the rates from Chicago and other western points are too high ; ; in fact , too near the New York basis. So it is to be expected that tho new rates will be put into effect _ b } ' Jonuary 1. The rates will be graded in the following ' order : From Missouri river points , from ' Mississippi river points , from Peoria , from Chicago , from Detroit , from Cleve land and so on.

He returned thanks for tho bountiful blessings vouchsafed tho land in its ma terial interests , and remembered Presi dent-elect Harrison in his petition. A few minutes wero spent in greeting sen ators , aud then Senator Sherman offered the usual resolution , that the secretary notify the house that tho senate is ready to proceed to business. At 12:47 tho senate took a recess , at tho conclusion of which the usual messago from tho house announcing tho fact of its beiug in session and of its having appointed a committee to wait upon tho president , was delivered. That was followed by a report from the committee to wait on the president to the effect that it had performed that duty and that tho presi dent would communicate with tho sen ate immediately , and then tho presi dent's message was delivered and Mr. McCook , secretary of the scnato , pro ceeded to read it. The reading of tho messago occupied an hour and twenty minutes. Those portions of it which discussed questions of tariff revision , treasury surplus , fishery troubles and the West incident , were listened to with very close attention aud apparent inter est by fourteen republican senators and about an equal number of democrats.

UNION PACIFIC'S DEBT TO UNCLE SAM. ' { Government Directors Urge that Somo Settle 11 ment be Mad * , / The government directors of the Un- a ion Pacific railroad company , iu theii III annual report to the secretary of tho in- 1 torior , under date of November 19,1888 , Bay that they have assumed as a promise * v . now beyoud tl Jscopo of discussion , ths- \ ' 1 necessity of ai&rndjustment botwoen the- | government and tho railroad company j ' for tho payment of funds horetoforo ad- vonced as a subsidy for tho building ot • | tho road. These moneys will be due * 1 says tho report , by the terms of agree- ' ment between the parties , in a fow years * and it is manifest that tho road is not j now , and will not bo then , in a condition i to satisfy its obligation. It is equally- | manifest that , should an adjustment not ( be effected , tho government will be com- * polled to take possession of tho road and. to operate it , a result so full of dangers , j embarrassments and difficulties thatit j should not be allowed to outer into dis- ( cussiou except as a last and unavoidable- ' . solution of a problem not otherwise to- * bo solved. . Tho government directors are still of' ' the opinion that it would bo bettor for tho United States to lose ovcYy dollar ot 1 its debt , and execute a roleaso to tho t company , than to undertake tlio- duties of a common carrier of goods. and passengers , thereby establish- ' ing a precedent which'would suro- ly creato mischief far beyond the- benefits to bo derived from so- hazardous an experiment. It must be clear , too , says the report , that every ' year that is allowed to pass wiihout liquidation and settlement of tho _ dobt , increases to a serious extent tho difliculJfl ties of tho solution. A debtor company jfl is necessarily under a disadvantage as * , H compared with its unfettered rivals. ijfl The questions between it and the gov- jjfl eminent , the report says , aro to be- .9 passed upon and determined by a body- Jfl of 111011 coming from different parts of { the country , actuated , it may bo im ' | H somo instances , by honest prejudice jfl founded upon imperfect knowledgo or - S distorted representation of facts , or not. tfl infrequently by n conviction that some. .jfl punitory measure should be adopted jfl against tho corporation , even at tho risk. fl of diminishing its ability to respond. | fl That body of men meets only at inter- jjfl vuls , and its attention is generally en- jfl grossed with other and moro important 'flj subjects of legislation. These and other- | elements of uncertainty embarrass the fll movements of the company , and para- | flj h/ze its freedom of action. It in as ira- ( M portaut to tho government ns lo the | | H company , saj's tho report , that all nee- \ M cssary liberty shouM bo given the m-in- , fl agers of the corporation to develop the flj resources upon which tit * ) i-olvciicy of flj the road must depend. It is not po.ai- I H ble. it that sit- ' M . says , a railway company - uated as h tne Union Pacific shall re- flj 111iin a considerable length of timo in < H 'he same condition. It must improve- i H or deteriorate. ' H The government directors assume that : J H some settlement should now bo made , H and commend tho conclusion of tho ma- j | ] orit3r report of the commission ap- \j \ M pointed under the act of March 3 , 1887 , * -j H as sound , judicious and practicable , and' i | they earnestly hope they will moet with. , M the approval of congress. By adopting these conclusions thoy H are of the opinion that the government 'flj will securo its claim beyond any reason- , H able risk. Its lien , they assert , will be- H placed in sueh shape as to make enforce- flj ment possible in case of default in the H payment of interest , and every j'ear ia H the future will mako the ultimate pay- H ment of the principal more probable. ' ] In concluding their report , the gov- . H Qrnment directors say that so far as they H have been able to ascertain , tho Union. 'ifll Pacific railroad has been in tho pant I H rear managed with fidelity and intelliflfl irence. Everything 1iik : been done that !
