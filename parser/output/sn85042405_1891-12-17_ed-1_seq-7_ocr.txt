HOW THEY LIKE IT. CommeBts of Landing Nevipiptn la This Counirjr and England on Hur* rlson's Message. Some Admire It and Some Don't—Usu­ ally Conceded to Be a Fair Document. Chilian's Highly Displeased and Said to Be Hiking Active Prepara­ tions for War. NEW YORK. Dec. 11.—All of the morniug papers have liberal comment on the president's message, the tone of which is generally favorable for expres­ sions and recommendations contained therein. The Herald says the message is a straightforword document which gives lis a clear photographic v' -w of the events which have absorbed the country's attention during the last twelve months. The prominent topics discussed are very naturally those sug­ gested by our foreign relations. On the whole it is a very interesting document in spite of the fact that we can not al­ ways agree with its conclusions and might take issue with many of its state­ ments, if wo were so inclined. The Times says the message is a de­ cidedly more respectable paper than those that have gone before it. Its tone is dignified, its arrangement clear and business like, most of its recommenda­ tions are conservative and sensible, and some of them are timely and sound. The Suu says the leading topics of the message are foreign affairs and the finances. What it has to say of Chili is of grave importance. There is no mistaking the language used, which throws light on the recent movements of our warships. The Recorder says the message is American throughout. It is the finished and comprehensive statement of an ex­ ecutive well informed as to the relations of our country with others, and always just regarding them, but who considers every topic, first of all with absoluee de­ votion to the interests of the people of the United States and particularly of the great mass of population who are wage earners. The Tribune says the one character­ istic of the message which must impress every candid reader is its absolute fre dom from partisanship or prejudice. There is in it no straining for effect. It is a simple, clear and business-like state­ ment of public affairs, full of practical suggestions. The Press says the message is a thor­ oughly American document, in every line which the spirit of patriotic de­ sire for the public welfare is clearly ex­ pressed. The World confines its comments on the .message to that portion of it in which the president refers to the new sys­ tem in Michigan in choosing presidential electors, and says he is animated by the old federal spirit and hungers for federal control in state affairs. Federal en­ croachment upon local self government, fThe World adds, has already gone dan­ gerously far, and hostility to its further advance is the hostility of principle and prudence, not merely of partisanship. Chicago Press Comment. Tribune: The message as a whole is plain, practical and business like, and covers the whole field of public interests. Times: President Harrison pursues the old form. He commences with the department of state and the relations of the republic with the rest of the world, and having, through the secretary's spectacles "surveyed mankind from China to Peru," takes up each depart­ ment in its turn, and consigns to the congressional dead letter office whole tons of information and recommenda­ tion. I News: As a straightforward business document, couched in dignified and terse language, President Harrison's 'message is one of the most satisfactory and comprehensive of recent years. Globe: The message lacks vigor, spirit, energy. It is lukewarm, except advocating aid to a private snap, or in commending some government official's work and the McKinley law. Herald: The.message, unlike the soul of wit, is long and unlike charity, it begins abroad, according to immortal custom. Beginning abroad, it stays there to the limit of four columns, or not much less than one-half the entire length of the document, roaming all the way from Russia to Hawaii. The por­ tion of the message relating to tariff and finance is singularly weak. Inter-Ocean: President Harrison's annual message conforms admir­ ably to the general purpose of such a document. It is a resume of the year, from the standpoint of the United States government in all departments and lead­ ing bureaus. From Other Sources. St. Paul Pioneer Press: The dis­ tinguishing characteristic of the mes­ sage of President Harrison is its intense practicality. It is a business man's document such a statement as the head of an enormous commercial concern might prepare for its board of directors, but on a scale commensurate with the mighty and manifold interests involved. St. Paul Olobe: The president's mes­ sage is a voluminous and conventional document without any features of par­ ticular saliency. It is coherent, well expressed aud gives evidence of that very respectable degree of intelligence of which Mr. Harrison, somewhat to the surprise of the public, has shown himself possessed. Minneapolis Tribune: The message will repay careful perusal, as it is one of the ablest, clearest and most inter­ esting state papers ever issued from the White House. Th la from England. LONDON,Dec. 11.—In commenting on President Harrison's message The St. James Gazette says: The most impor­ tant point is that which refers to the tariff. The arguments presented eom ptve significantly with British figures, which show a stationary condition of trade. It is all well to say that Ameri­ cans will presently discover the mistake in the fiscal policy, but perhaps they may not. In the meantime the calcula­ tions of the supporters of che McKinley bill are working out much better than any one in England has reason to ex­ pect. The Daily News says: The president's message leaves nothing to£be desired in tone or in temper. Mr. Harrison is less exasperating than Mr. Blaine, and consequently more statesmanlike. He would not speak so tenderly of recipro­ city if his protection policy was a suc­ cess. THE

THEY DON'T LIKE IT. Chilian* Find no Comfort In Harrison'* Meuai*—Preparing for War. VALPARAISO, Chili, Dec. 11.—The sub­ stance of President Harrison's state­ ment of Chilian affairs has been received and is a subject of universal comment. It is regarded by Chilians as- decidedly menacing a rupture between between the two countries, as it is not believed that the Chilian government will con­ sent either to apology or any material indemnity. The majority in congress is known to be opposed to any concession, although poesessed of great influence, and the Chilian government would find it difficult to carry the neces­ sary support for humiliating measures. It is now no secret that the government is proceeding actively with warlike preparations and that artillery of the latest manufacture has been ordered from Germany in anticipation of hostili­ ties possibly with other powers and probably with the United States. More ltritish Storms. 

LONDON, Dec. 11.—Another severe gale has swept over the British isle3 causing an immense amount of damagfe almost everywhere. Houses were un­ roofed, chimneys blown down and a number of wrecks are strewn along the coast. Happily, up to the present there has been no loss of life reported, but there is much additional suffering among those who have already lost by the half dozen various storms, which have marked the past year as being an unprecedented one in the weather his­ tory of this side of the Atlantic. Owing to the fact that the telegraph wires are down, in several sections, communica­ tion with those parts is interrupted. White Caps in Cleveland.

German Loader of Flnnnce to Get Away With Two 91.11* lion Marks. He Is at Present Supposed to Ron His Way to the United States. A Brother, Supposed to Be Iiiip'Scril: in the Matter, Placed UnUcr Arrest. BERLIN, Dec. 11.—The German world of finance has been startled by another crash among its monied institutions and by the discovery that another hitherto highly respected, admired and envied financier had been embezzling money for a long time past. In this latest revelation of fraud Adolph Albeft, a prominent banker of Mailitz, in Prussian Silsea, has been declared a bankrupt, and an examination into his affairs shows a very poor outlook for his credit­ ors. The banking house ht the head of which was Herr Adolph Albert was composed of himself and his brother Marcus, and from present appearances Adolph, at least, has been defrauding his clients for a long time past. He is said to have embezzled over 2,000.000 marks, including one deposit of 788,000 marks. Albert has left for parts un­ known, but he is believed to be on his way to the United States. Herr Marcus, Ado'ph's brother, is believed to be im­ plicated in the embezzlements and has been placed under arrest. Qustrrolied at a Funerstl.
