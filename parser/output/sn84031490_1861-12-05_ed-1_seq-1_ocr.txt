The “ Third Order" could not live twenty fair hours where the principles of this masterly report arc applied. It will now l.e time to discover whether military orders of this kind originate at the Capital, or are mainly and more truly to be traced to the pro-slavery sympathies, aqjj chival rous proclivities of the queers who issue them.

This is in accordance v.ith ail order from the War Department, winch without any definite explanation of the matter, we take to he the mode selected f r doing away with all question as to the release of the parole imposed on the entire Brigade. The difficulties that have sprung np in making the terms of exchange at St. l.m'.is. would for a long time delay the completion of the organization nowreform ing. Col.

Washington landlords and landladies arc getting ready for a rich harvest of dollars. For very moderate board in the vicinity of the Capital, twenty and twenty-five dollars per week for a single man is demanded and paid.

OUR WASHINGTON LETTER. A Tlslt to Washington Jail. A BLACK HOLE OF.CALCUTTA AND THE BLACK AKD WHITE THINGS THEREIN. [From Onr Own Correspondent.] Wa-hixgtoh, December 2,1861 In company with Senator Grimes, of lowa, Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, I Tisited Washington jail a day or two since, and spent the most disagreeable j half hour I have known in many years. Im- | agine a dingy three story hnilding, of the prison architecture of 1790, of about the di mensions of the North Market building in Chicago, with 218 persons, black, white and mixed, packed into it like herrings, close, foul, without ventilation or any apparent drainage, and you can form some taint idea of the atmosphere which saluted our nostrils as wc passed from the jailor’s ward-room into ! the prisoners’ apartments. A heap of lime lay slacking and fuming on the lower floor for the purpose evidently of disinfecting the air in the main passages. The fumes did not reach the prisoners’ quarters, or if they did, they wore driven back by the superior strength of the exhalations there engendered. The first candidate wc met was an insane sol dier. The jailer told us that though quite harmless, he was as crazy as a loon. His looks fully confirmed the testimony. His clothes were stringy and baggy and thatched, with more straw than Edgar was bedecked with when he met King Lear in the forest. His hair also was plentifully adorned with the same trimming. “It’s no use doing anything for him,” said the jailor.” “No,” replied the un fortunate, “no use doing nothing for me;" and he trotted away to his pile of short, dirty j straw, where he dropped down on all fours, I and rooted in it like a pig. The jailer explained I to us that he hadbclongcdto the regular army; v, hen his aberrations were first noticed he was sent here; that he (the jailer) had sent for the brigade surgeon to examine him and remove him to the asylum; that the surgeon had ex amined him and pronounced him insane, and promised to have him taken care of. This was long enough ago to have removed the asylum to the lunatic, but here he was still, rooting in his straw heap, and presenting his vacant, pit eous, unwashed face to stray visitors.like our selves. Wc nest turned into a corridor from which half a dozen ceils opened. Theprisonersi f.Vcut in number, were standing oa the brick floor, with very little elbow room, and with no aperture for tbc admission of fresh air, except the grating of tbc iron door. Wc essayed to enter, but tbc odor which met us was intolerable. It was useless to bold our handkerchiefs to our noscs—thc palpable stench came into our eyes, mouths and ears. We retreated in good order, however, and held a brief conversation at the entrance with the inmates. One of them was a private in Company E, Col. Brodhead’s Michigan caval ry ; said he had been sent to iail forgetting “a little drunk,” and falling out of line. Proba bly he fell out of line a long distance, but ac coVding to the commitment book he had done nothing worthy of confinement in such a hole ns this. (Senator Grimds sent word to a Lieutenant of Company E, statingthese facts, who has promised to look into the matter and got the man back into daylight and interline.) Another one was a private hi Company F, 2Jd Pennsylvania regiment, sent to jail for drunk enness. There “were others in the corridor who wore United States uniforms and who were there for the same offence. These things would not be worth noticing hut lor the obvious fact that when a man gets into Washington jail for any less crime than murder or grand larcenv, the world outside forgets him“as though lie were in his grave. A soldier might grow to old age there, if it were not for"the villanous atmosphere of the place, and finally die with an. account of drunkenness unsettled against him. Wc then went to the negro quarters, female department. If the sight of an insane soldier had been a surprise to us, the first object that wc now encountered was something more. “Who are yon—what arc you here for?” asked the Senator from lowa, addressing a mulatto girl who sat on the floor sewing her apron. , „ “Youknowwho Mary Kill is? I h longs to Man* Hall,” she replied. “What arc you here for?” was the next query. “For safe keep’n, I spose.’ We turned to the jailer for an explanation. He told us it was true. The woman was the slave of Marv Hall, who had scut her to the jail for safe keeping. Mary herself keeps the largest house of ill’ fame in Wsishington, and the Government .keeps a hoarding house for her negroes. An intelligent and comparatively neat look ing colored woman next attracted our atten tion, when the following conversation ensued: Q. —Whut are you here for? A-—Don’t know. Q.—Who sent you here ? A.— n officer. G—Arc vou a fugitive? Did you run away ? A—i Sot ’zactlv. My master lived near Al exandria. When the soldiers he wanted to move to the Junction and. so I came away— me and mv little boy—lie's up stairs. 0— What was your master’s name ? 1— Triplett. o—What ftcy bring you here for ? JL— When the man. took me I to go and see General Mansfield. He eaid he Would take me to General Mansfield, | but he brought me here. I haven’t seen Geu -1 era! Mansfield yet morc’n six mouths, i We asked the jailor how many fugitives he H (: replied, forty-five. The average at tendance wa*s somewiiat larger, but a gang of males had been takeu out lately to work on the Capitol grounds. We went up-stairs where the woman said her little boy was, and where, it was plain, her own heart was. In the main corridor were twenty or thirty male negroes, of all ages, from six to sixty. Wc should not have recognized the sou of the wo man below, but forlhe help of the jailor, he was so much whiter than his mother. These negroes had, of course, committed no crime except that of being bom. The army came among them, their rebel masters fled, and we put them in the third story of the Washington Jail, where wc fed them in a trough, on Fonrieritc principles, where no one has any better chance than his neighbors, unless he gets into it lengthwise. Four of them were plaving a game ol old sledge with a mutilated pack of cards, and a dozen others were look ing on ; one was dancing the double-shuttle and the remainder were singing or talking and into the quarters of the free blacks. Most of them arc confined for petty offences, such as thieving and vagrancy. One, bright eyed intelligent looking fellow, about twenty years of age, being asked why he was there, replied: ‘‘For walking in the street with a slave girl.” The hardened ruffian! It was true. The laws of this district pro liibit such laxity of walking. The theory or philosophy, of the case is, that the girl might fall in love with him and excntually run away forhissakc. . . Wc came down and went out. We must have a new jail,” remarked Senator G. “What,” I asked, “would you do with the old one?” . ~, .. “ Put a barrel of powder into it aud blow it mp,” he replied.

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] AVashikoton, December 4,1861. The debate in the Senate, to-day, by IViL | son, Hale, Fessenden, Sumner, and Grimes, on the Washington Judiciary, the jail, and slavery in the District of Columbia, was re freshing. Nobody defended cither institution. Some bill will probably pass, abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, either im mediately by compensating legal owners, or by declaring all bom after a certain date free. Senator Wilson, in introducing joint resolu tions directing for the discharge of all colored persons in the city jail now held to answer for specified crimes, read from an elaborate re port made tothe Provost Marshal (Porter,) by a detective employed to examine into the condition of tie !nc?.rceratt2 contrabands. He (the detective) states that he found sixty in filth,-a prey to contagious diseases. without shoes, with insufficient clothing, bedding, or fire, and iu a half starv ing condition. The detailed statements of the whole number Incarcerated, follow In the re port. The majority belonged to rebel masters, from whom they ran away, some because of ihc threat of being taken to Manassas, some in consequence ofill-treatmcnt, some because they would not follow their masters to the rebel army. Two or three were free menfrom Maryland, Minnesota, or Pennsylvania, who accompanied Northern regiments. Several belonged to owners whose political sentiments do not appear. Several were in the employ o f the Government at the time of their arrest. .Among them, one once belonging to John A. Washington, who declined to go to Manassas to wait on bis master and Col. Lee. One be longed toTodcrington, once an officer of the Senate, but now captain in the rebel army who left his slave here till the end of the war. Representative Gurley’s confiscation and colonization scheme, of which I gave you no tice yesterday, will provide for the freedom of all slaves belonging to the rebels, their em ployment during this war in such way as may be best calculated to bring it to a successful termination, their apprenticeship at its close to loyal masters for six years, and their final colonization to some tropical climate selected meanwhile by Commissioners. Their wages arc to contribute to the colonization fund. Mr. Arnold, of Illinois, has given notice of a similar bilL Mr. Arnold has also given notice of a bill to establish a national armory and arsenal at Chicago. The 10,000 uniforms manufactured in France, and recently arrived in New York, are to be I the reward of discipline and valor; and the | 83d Pennsylvania and 18th Massachusetts were each presented with a complete regimental outfit to-day. The 83d is accredited the best regiment in Gen. Butterfield's Brigade, which is the best brigade iu Porter’s Division, which is the best division in the Potomac army. The uniforms arc very handsome and perfect iu I all equipments and appendages. A large invoice of the importation has gone West. Fugitive slaves who have recently arrived report from 60,000 to 80,000 troops between CentreviHe and Bull Run, with only one regi ment at Germantown. There is trouble be. tween the Virginia and South Carolina troops. Some of the latter have gone home. Gen. Benham, from Gauley, is here under j arrest. He asks for a court of inquiry on th<? question of who let SloJ’d escape , Secretary Seward has ordered iuc Washing'' ton police to discontinue sending contrabands to jail, and to treat them as under military protection. So much for the airing given to the matter in the Senate. The Treasury report will not be ready till Saturday. It will propose and urge the adop tion of some paper money and banking sys’ tern by which a Government circulating medi um will be created. Mr. Faulkner, at Fort 'Warren, has written to Congressman Fenton, of New York, pray ing to be put on parole and sent to Richmond. He pledges himself to exchange Mr. Ely for himself. The Indiana members were serenaded to night. Speeches were made by Senator Henry 8. Lane, Schuyler Colfax and Wm. M. Dunn.

Mr. Wilson accordingly introduced a resolution for their release. Mr. HALE, of N. H., advocated the passage of the resolution. He remarked that wc are now supporting the slaves of the rebels for them during the war. He thought this country thc'most corrupt, from the bupreme Court down, of any other in the world. The coxirse of justice in this city was the most extraordinary. He argued . that It was the duty of Congress to look into the administration of justice In this District. Mr. WILSON remarked that he had visited tlicse pool- prisoners »a things'of-n bicli lie Lad spoteu, tin, cruel condition in which the inmates were placed. He endorsed the views expressed by Mr. Hale as to the administration of justice in this Dis trict. He was willing that his resolution should be referred to tjio Judiciary Com* kcDOI’GALL, of Cal., suggested that instead of dcuouneiiur the administration of justice in the District,“they should propose a proper remedy and discuss the best mode of reform. Mr. FESSENDEN, of Me., rcmunced to the Senators that durimr a former session, while it was proposed to make for a proper prison in this citv, the necessity for withholding the moans fur other purposes, viz: for the prosecution of the war, was timed. As to the judiciary system in this District, he had for years looked on the hopelessness of reform, but now he saw an opportunity for a change, and therefore trust ed that the* entire subject would be fully and properlv dealt with. With regard to fugitive slaves, there was much feeling on that ques tion, and it was intimately connected with the difficulties In which the country is now in volved. He wanted to mete out justice and discriminate as to the facts. The debate was farther continued. Among the speakers was Mr. Sumner, in earnest ap probation of his colleague's resolution, which was referred to the Committee on District of Columbia Affairs. On motion of Mr. CLARjxE, of N.

Smith, ofPadacah—EOs Royalty. [Correspondence Cincinniti Commercial, 3d-] Brigadier General C. F. Smith, who h-as charge of ~,, l sw)st, is exceedingly unpopular _<fK the rebels, and refusing to aid L mou men who have been driyeu from their and whose property has bccnpmnaereu ---• sece«h. Only a few days ago a party of L mon men called upon him for a emallforcc to assist them in releasing one of their friends who had been captured by the rebels, and was then m iaii at-Mayfield, only twenty-five miles from • endwho-'they knew would be murdered n? 11 -**- • -at But he flatly if nOt resenev. - «wd that night the poor man fused to mterferc.au^tw^ +l “& y.™*. was taken out of jail u r r** 0 and then shot and bayoneted through the body several times. I have the above facts from a gentleman who saw the dead body thus mu tilated, and knew them to be reliable. Scores of men are here from counties south and west of this, who have had to leave their families and flee for their lives. Their farms and stores have been plundered, and their wives and chil dren are threatened with destruction, yet they dare not return, and cannot prevail on those having anthoritv here to aid them in the least. An effort is being made to have General Smith superceded, and many think It will be succcss fnh An incident occurred here last night that may lead to something serious. Next door to Gen. Smith’s headquarter*} lives a seces sion family of some pretensions, with wuom the General is ca very friendly terms. In the same vicinity is encamped one of the Indiana, regiments, who have been greatly ahhoyed by the waving of secession dags from the windows as the boys passed and repassed the houses. The officers of the regiment concluded last night that they 7/bnid nut a stop to these proceedings. Ac cordingly, afifif supper, they went quietly to the house, having wuu them a Union llag, and demanded that it should be put up on the building, and be allowed to remain there. To this objections were made, and a great outcry raised by the family, which brought ■ out General Smith, who demanded what was the matter, and when told, ordered the offi cers to return to their quarters, or he would have them arrested. As soon as Gen. Wal lace became aware of the above facts, he or dered out the entire regiment, and with them repaired to the house, when the flag was quictlv unfurled from the roof of the build ing, and it floats them in triumph to-day. During the excitement one of Gen. Smith’s aids, who attempted to interfere, was very roughly handled, being down and beaten in a shocking manner. M hetlicr this will lead to a rupture between the Generals or not remains to be seen. Wo all hope that the War Department may soon find a field of operations where the Gen eral in command may have an opportunity to display his loyalty more conspicuously than he has here. From Tennessee. [From the' Cincinnati Commercial.] Private advices prove that King Harris, of Tennessee, sits uncomforlablv on his throne; and the transfer of Jett’s imperial council to the City of Rocks can only give him that poor consolation which misery derives from compa ny. A regiment of volunteers under his last call, said "to number 1,700 men, which had rushed together, under Col. John Head, a lawyer of (Jallatin, impelled by the delusion, no doubt, which became pretty general in that part of Dixie a month ago, that two hundred and fifty thousand Confederate troops would be in Southern Kentucky within a few weeks, and anv amount of Enfield rifles smuggled in from "England, encamped at the Red‘Sul phur Springs, not far from the Ken tucky line. The other day they palled up stakes, bumM their camp equipage and returned home, on the ground’ that they could get no arms. No doubt this and similar failures caused the tyrant’s last splutteration about the militia. *Tlic truth is, there are many people in Middle Tennessee who will not bring in their private arms at the crack of Master Harris’s whip. They desire to keep them for the express purp9sc of shooting him on the wing, when, he begins a stampede like that of Governor Jackson. But until the Fed eral army marches to their relief, the fretful usurper will subject them to all manner of ty rannical inquisition. The rebels of Southern Kentucky, too, are making it manifest by their actions that the advance breezes of a cornin' 1 * storm have shaken the leaves about them." Some of the secession merchants of Glasgow have transferred their stock to Frank lin, and others are growing uneasy. Kentucky Legislature.
