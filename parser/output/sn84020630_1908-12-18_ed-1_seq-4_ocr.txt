IMPROVEMENT OF THE DISTRICT SCHOOLS. The public schools in the districts of New Mexico should be aided finan cially and good teachers, better school houses, proper school books, decent school furniture and sufficient fuel for the winter should be supplied by the counties. This could he done at a comparatively small uxpen.se, and is very necessary in the present state ot the school system in this terri tory, as it is greatly desired and very important that the growing generation should be brought up to speak, read and write the English language, that being the language of their country.

A law will be asked to authorize the supple menting of the resources of the sparse ly populated districts with county and territorial appropriations. A great many district boards find their funds are only large enough to provide for a ! three or four months' school. The law should be amended to have this deficit made up and a minimum of five months' school permitted. The law provides for a maximum dis trict levy.

' "As a matter of fact, however, this particular point was hardly dwelt upon in the argument of the cases decided on Monday of this week.

DEPARTMENT OFFICERS CANNOT CHANGE THE LAW. The Supreme Court of the United States in a recent decision dissented from portions of an opinion recently given by Judge Lewis of the United States district court of Colorado at Denver, in which Judge Lewis held that a department of the government could make no rules or regulations that were not consistent with the laws enacted by Congress in public land matters. The attorney general of the United States appealed the case to the Su preme court and the Denver Repub- lican makes the following remarks up on the decision of the matter which are very pertinent, and of special in terest to settlers on the public domain I and those who have made claims and secured tracts of land under the pro visions of what is known as "The 'Stone and Timber Act." Says the Republican: "While the Supreme Court of the United States has reversed the judg ment of Judge Lewis of the federal district court in certain 'coal and tim ber land cases decided a few months ago In the United States district court lor Colorado, it should be recognized that the decision does not seem to conflict in. any way with the ruling by ' Judge Lewis respecting the efficacy of department rules and regulations. ."Judge Lewis held that the force of statutes could not be given to the rules and regulations of a department, and it was this particular feature which at tracted wide attention. , "Among well-informed lawyers, how ever, it was recognized that much of the sertsation produced was due rather to public ignorance respecting the law than to anything radical in the ruling Itself. The Supreme court had made in .effect the same decisions upon sev ers! occasions; but the , persistency THE HOMESTEAD AREA SHOULD BE INCREASED. Strong efforts are being made in the national house of representatives by I w ebie n congressmen for the increase I of the area of homestead entries from iw to jjo acres of land for each en try. Representative Mondell of Wyo ming has introduced such a bill, and his colleagues in the Senate ' and House of Representatives are pushing its passage with vim and vigor. The Denver Republican puts'the sit uation correctly in discussing the pas sage of the measure, saying: "We hone that Representative Mon dell of Wyoming will succeed at this session in securing the passage of the bill to increase the size of arid land homesteads from 1G0 to 320 acres vvnen the size of a homestead loca tion, was fixfcd : by.

Ex perience having demonstrated that o homestead of only 1C0 acres within the region in question is not large enough Mr. Mondell introduced a bill to au thorize the entry of 320 acres in lo calities where, were it practicable, ir rigation would be resorted to. 1 "The bill contemplates the entry umy 01 tana which though arid or semi-arid, cannot be placed under ir rigation.
