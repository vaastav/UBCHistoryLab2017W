President’s Message. J-'tliistc '.-Wizens <->/ t/" ■'irnulr Hut] >j .• Another veai of health and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our national affairs, our renewed and pro found gratitude to God is due. RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS. We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers. I in* efforts of disloyal citi zens of the United states to involve Us in foreign war to aid on an inexcusable insur rection have been unavailing. Her Brittanic Majesty's Government, as was justly eitiected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expe ditious from British ports. Tike Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly indicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest. y)Ue -lions of great intricacy and import mce have arisen out of the 1)1 *ckade and other belligerent operations, between tiiis Govern ment and several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, so far as was possible, accommodated i:i the spirit ol frankness, justice, and mutual good will It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, bv the impartiality of their adjudications, h ive commanded the respect and confidence of other maritime powers. The supplemental treaty between tin- I idl ed State- and Great Britain for the suppn -- -ion of the African slave trade, made on tin 17lh day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is be lieved, so far as American ports and Ameri can citizen' are concerned, that this inhuman and barbarous traffic has been brought to an end. I shall submit, for the consideration ol the Senate, the adjustment of the possessory claims in Washington Territory arising out of the treaty of the 15th of June, IS4>, between the United States and Great Britain, which have been the sources of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of our country. A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in tbe waters which surround the Is land of Cuba, lias been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbi tration of a friendly power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it proper to submit to the approval of tne Senate, to concur with tin interested commercial powers in an arrange ment for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles winch have been hereto fore adopted in regard to the inipo.-ts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. The lung pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizure at Salina, Peru, by Chilian officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citi zens of tbe United States, has been brought to a close by the ward of His Majesty, the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected monarch, and, although the sum awarded to the claim ants may not have been as large as they ex pected, there is no reason to distrust the wis dom of' His Majesty’s decision. That decis ion was promptly complied with by Chili, when intelligence in regard to it reached that country. The Joint Commission, under the act of the last session, lor carrying into effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business entrusted to it. IMtticuuiea concerning the oceanic transit through Niciiraugna arc in course of a.i ami cable adjustment, in conformity with the prin ciples set forth iu my last annual message. 1 have received a representative from the United States of Columbia, and have accred ited a minister to that lb-public. 

CONCERNING ALIENS. Incidents occurring in tiie progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention tue uncertain state of international question? touching the rights of foreigners in this coun try and of United Slates citizens abroad. In regard to some governments, these rights an al least partially defined by treaties; in no instance however, is it expressly stipulated hat on the instance ol civil war a foreigner residing in this country, within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government ot Ins count r \ cannot expect any piivi’-ges or immunities distinct from that character. i regret to say, however, that -uch claims have b cn put forward, and in so.ue instances m behal: of foreigners who have lived in the United Stales the greater part of their live?. There is reason to believe that many persons, born in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been full) naturalized, have evaded the military duty required ot them, by denying the fact, and thereby throwing upon the Gov ernment the burden id proof. It ha? b- en found difficult oi impracticable to obtain tfii? proot, from the want of guides to the proper sources ol iuturuialiou. These might i -tp piled b) requiring the Ulerks ofCourts, where declaration ot intention mav be made, or nat uralization effected, to send periodical!) li?t? of the names ot persons naturalized or declar ing their intention to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose depart ment these names must be arranged and prin ted for general information. There is also reason to believe that foi- igners frequently become citizei s of the Catted States tor the sole purpose of evading the duties imposed fit the laws of their sev eral countries, to which, on becoming natu ralized, they .it once repair, and though never returning to the United State,?, the) still claim the interposition of the govern ment a.? citizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It i.? therefore submitted to your serious consideration. It might he ad visable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen ot the I nited States, residing abroad, nia\ claim the interposition of the government. The right of suffrage has often been a.? sumed and exercised by aliens under the pre tence ot naturalization, which thev have and ?- avowed when drafted into the militarv sit- Ttce. 1 submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law? will make the fait of voting an rC.yip. against any plea of ex emption from military sei vice, or civil obligations, on the ground ot alienage. JAPAN. In common with other Western power-, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of that empire to the enlighten-d and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring tin country into the society ol nations. It is to be hoped, although not with entire confidence, that those dilh - .ty be peacefully ov. :- come. 1 a.-k your attention to the claims of the Minister residing there for the damage he sustained in the destruction by tire of the residence ■ i the Legation at Yeddo. IN fEKNATION VL TELKORaPH. Satis! ■ with the Km pc tor of Russia, which it is be lieved will result in effecting a continuous line ot telegraph through tliat Umpire f:om our 1 acific coast. 1 recommend to v,.ur fa vorable consideration the subject of an inter national telegraph a- r -- the Atlantic ocean. - - teleg this \ and the national forts along the Atlantic -ca boards and the Unit of Mexico. Such con nections.established with any rt ... -..al !• out lay would be economical, as cl! - . ff,-, ;i V c aid- to diplomatic treaties and the naval ser vice. OCR CONSULAR SYSTEM. The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last Oongres-, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so, with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored. Our minister abroad have been faithful in defcndii g A ner ican rights, in protecting our commercial in terests. Our consuls hav* necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibil ities growing out of the war. The*** they have fur the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This just acknowl- edgement includes those consuls who, residing in Morrocco, Egypt, China, and other central countries, art* changed with comprehensiv e •<nd extraordinary powers iin it hr ivories Tbe condition of lh icVr.rai oiganizcd Ter i itories is generally satisfactory, although tbe Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppi cased. The mineral re sources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona are proving far richer than heretofore understood. 1 lay before you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico. UniikrKAl ION. 1 again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration. Although this source of national wealth is again flowing hither with greater freedom than for several vears before the insurrection occurred, there i- -till a great deficiency of laborers in every fi Id of industry, and especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron ami coal as of the precious metals. While the demand lor labor is thus increased lu re, tens of thou sands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, arc thronging our foreign con sulates and ottering to immigrate to the Unit 'd .States if essential but very cheap assist ance can be afforded the n. Under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning anew life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the Government. foreign - claims. Injuries unforseen by the government and unintended may in some eases have been in flicted upon the subjects or citizens of for eign countries, both at sea and on laud, by persons in the service of the United States. - this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflict ed bv persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must prepare to do justice to foreigners. It the existing judi cial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a -pecial court may be authorized, with pow - er to decide such claims of the character re ferred to as may have arisen under treaties and public laws. Conventions for adjusting claims by commissioners have been proposed to some governments, but no definite answer to the proposition? has been received from an\. In the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and awarded by the Admiralty Court, and in other cases where this government may ac knowledge itself to be liable in principle and when the amount of that liability has been ascertained bv an informal arbitration. The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required, by the law of the L'. S. upon the subject, to demand a tax on tiie incomes ot the foreign consuls in this country While such a demand may not be interdicted by public law or by an existing treaty between the United Stales and a for eign country, the expediency of so far modi fying the act as to exempt from tax the in comes of such consuls, who are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emol uments of their offices or property not situa ted in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration. 1 make this sugges tion upon the ground that a country which ought to be reciprocated exempts our con uls and all other countries’ from taxa tion, to the extent indicated. The United States ought not to be less liberal to other nations. PUBLIC FINANCES. The operations of the Treasury during the la-t year have been successfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law has proved a valuable support of the credit, and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the ex pectation of its authors. Some amendments may he required to perfect the operations of the existing laws, but no change in their principles or general scope is belived to be ueees.-ary. Since these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury touching the army and navy have been promptly met and fully satisfied. So consid erable a body of troops it is believed, were never before so amply provided for or more liberally and punctually paid. And it may be added, that by no people were the burdens incident to a great w ar, ever more cheerfully borne. The receipts during tiie year from all | sources, including loans and balance in the ti usury at its commencement were $901,- 1: 5,67*.86. The aggregate disbursements, £?'.*5,7'.'6,630.65; leaving a balance on the 1 Tth ot July, 1863, of *5,329,04 1.21. Ot the receipts, there were derived from customs, 866,059,142. 4" ; from internal revenue, $37.- 640,787.95; from direct taxes, *1,485,703.61 ; Irom lands, *167,617.17 ; from miscellaneous sources, *3,846,615.35; and from loans, *776,6-?2,361.57 ; making the aggregate ■8 "‘1,12-,'74.86. Of the disbursements I here w. re $232,53..22 for pensions, Ve.; *4,216,- 52".59 for interest on the public debt, and *24,7 29,8 4 6.51 for ——— ; $.v.t9,2'i8,60i for the war department; *63,- 211,105.27 tor the navy department; for the < payment ot tiu* funded and temporary debt, *1 ■'1,086,635.07; making an aggregate of v '' 1, 5,766,63<*.65, and leaving a balance of * 329,( * 11.21 ; but the payment of the fund ed and temporary debt having been made Iroin monies borrow' and during the year, must be regarded as merely a nominal payment, and monies borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts and the actual amount, *1 si.- 086,635.t>7, should therefore be deducted from the receipts and disbursements. That being done, there remains as the actual re ceipts, *714,709,'.'95.58, leaving the balance as already stated. As the actual receipts and disbursements for tiie remaining three-quarters of the cur rent ti? al year of T'-nl, will be shown in de i i il by the report of the Secretary of the ; Treasury, to which I invite your attention, it i? sufficient to say here that il is not believed that the actual results will exhibit a state of ' the finances h-sS favorable to the country j than the estimates ot that officer heretofore submitted, while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both the dis bursements and debts w ill be found verv con suteiabD Ic-s than has been anticipated. report or WAR DFPaLN'IEXT.

It has appeared impossible to make an available summary of this report, except such a- would be too extended for this place, and hence I content myself in referring vour at tention to the rojiort itself. THE BLOCKADE. Ti.e duties devolving on the naval branch ot the service during the y ar. and throuch t the I ti..- unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. I lie extensive blockade has been c<-u?tantly incieasing inefficiency a? the navv i.as ex; an vied ; yet, in =o long a time, it has so fai been 1 mpossible ■ press iqp.t trade. From the returns re ceived at the Navy Department, it appears m .. \. ssels bare been cap tured since the blockade was instituted, and V A. e ol j'rizi - alreadv sent in for •* '• ■ ation amounts to over sl3,o"o,ihn. THE NAVT. ■ ■ ’■ IS - con ?.?.- at . ns ioie ol 58? vessels, completed and in course of completion, and of these 75 are iron-clad armored steamers. The events of the wa- give' an increased interest and impor tance to toe Navy, winch mil probablv c.x tend beyond the war itself. The armored vessels in our Navy, completed and in service, or which are under contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in number those of any other power, but while these may be relied on for harbor defence and ea •roast service, others of greater strength and capacity will b<* necessary for cruising purpo ?t s. and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean. Xhf change that has takpu place in naval vessels and naT. 1 tv aria re since the introdu tion of steam as a motive power foi ships of war, demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards, or the establishment of new ones for the construc tion and necessary repairs of modem war vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, delay and public injury has been experienced from the want of such Government establish ■nenla. The necessity ol such a navy yaid -i> furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard, lias on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and i? again present*, and in the report of the Secretary, which accom panies this communication. I think il my duty to invite jour especial attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing yards and depots for naval purposes upon one of the western rivers. A naval force lias been created on these interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within a little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commence ment of the present Administration. Satisfactory and important a? have been the performances ol the heroic men of the navy, at this interesting period, they arc scarcely more wonderful than the services of mer chants and artiz.iiis in the production of war vessels, which has created anew form of naval power. Our country has advantages superior to any other nation, in our resources in iron and timber, with inexhaustible quan tities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all accessible and in close prox imity to navigable waters. Without the ad vantage of public works the resources of the Nation have been developed, and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of such magnitude, which has at the very period of its creation rendered signal service t" tin- Union. The increase of the number of seamen in the public service—from 7,000 men in the spring of 1861, to about 24,000 at the present time—has been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to pro mote that increase. It has been found, how ever, that the operation of the draft—with the high bounties paid for army recruits—is beginning to effect injuriously the naval ser vice, arid will, if not corrected, be likeiy to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing thorn to enter the army. I. therefore, respectfully suggest that Congress might aid both tiro army and the naval service, by adequate pro visions on this subject, which would, at thc same time, be equitable to the communities more especially interested. 1 commend to your consideration the sug gestion? of the Secretary of the Navy, in re gard to the policy of fostering and training seamen for the naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering signal service in pre paring midshipmen for the highly responsible duties which, in after life, they will be re quired to perform. In order that the coun try should not be deprived of a proper quota of educated persons for which legal provision has been made at the naval school, the va cancies caused by neglect or omission to make nominations from the States in insur reetiou have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at any previous period, and is in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress. 

POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. During the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Postoflice Department has been one of insreasing prosperity, and I am gratified m being able to state that the re ceipts of postal revenue have nearly equalled the entire expenditure, the latter amounting to *11,314,000.84 and the former to $11,163,- 789.09, h aving a deficiency ol but *150,417.- 25. Iu the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $565,- 670,549, the postal receipts of thatyear being $204,972,219 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent., but the annual expenditures on account of the same have been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest therefore that the Postoflice Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with restoration of the w hole service. The International Conference of postal dmegates from the principal countries ol Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of our Post Master General, met at Paris on the 11 tl* of May last, and con cluded its deliberations on the Bth of June. The principles established by the conference as first adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations, and as the basis of future conventions, inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges at reduced rates of postage, and cannot fail to produce beneficial results. THE INTERIOR. 1 refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, w hich is herewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in re lation to the Public Lauds, Indian Affairs, Patents, Pensions and other matters ol public concern pertaining to that Department. The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarters of the present fiscal year was 3,841,549 acres, of which 161,911 acres were sold for cash ; 1,456,514 acres wore taken up under the homestead law, and the residue disposed of, under the law grant ing lands for military purposes, for railroads and other purposes. It is also thought that the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase. It has long been a cherished opin ion of some of our wisest statesmen that the people ol the United States had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settle ment and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. | This opinion has had a controlling influence i in shaping legislation upon the subject of our ! national domain. 1 may cite as evidence of | this, the liberal measures adopted in refer ence to actual settlers; the grant to States of overflowed lands w ithin their limits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation ; the grant to railroad companies ol alternate sections of land upon the con templated lines of their roads that, when com pleted, w ill largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions. This policy has rec ived its most signal I and beneficent illustration in the recent en ; actment giving homesteads to actual settle;?. I Since the first daj of January last, U I fore-mentioned quantity of 1,456,514 acres of land has been taken tip under its provi sions. This fact and the amount of sales i furnish gratifying evidence of the increasing settlements upon public lands, not withstand j ing a great struggle in w hich the energies of the nation have been engaged and which has required so largo a withdrawal of our citi zens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval services of the United States. I doubt not that Con gress w ill cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changing the general I feature- of the system, secun • tl gi . : practicable extent its benefits to those who t nave left their homes in defence of their ■ country in this arduous crisis. I invite vour attention to the vi w? of the S of War. as to the propriety of raising by legislative appropriation .. revenue from the mineral laud? ot the United State?. THE 

INDIANS. The inca-u.cs provided .i your last session for the removal ol certain Indian tribe?, have a carried in ; v I Sundry ti s bare been negotiated with and the treaties made • w ill, in due time, be submitted for the con stitutional nctma of the Senate. Tl;.;. con- I tain a stipulation for extinguishing the pos?--?- 1 sivo rights of the Indians to huge and valu able tracts of land. It is probable that the | effects ol these troalic? will result in the es tahluliment of a permanent friendly relation w ith such ol these tribes as have boon brought I into frequent and bloody •oib.-ion? with our , out-lying settlements and emigrants. Sound ; policy and our imperative duty to t tribes 1 demand of the Government an anxious and constant attention to their well-being ; to | their progress iu the arts of civilization ; and, above all, to that moral training which, under i the ble sing of Divine Providence, wid confer I upon them the elevated and sanctifiying in finances, the hopes and consolations of the Clristian faith. i suggested in my last annual message, the propriety of remodeling our Indian system.— Subsequent ••vents have s.itt-fied m*- of its necessity. The details set forth in thr im port of the Secretary, will evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action. I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronised by the Government in this district to your generous arid fostering care. THI ILLINOIS CANAL, The attention of Congress, during the last session, was engaged, to some extent, with appropriations tor enlarging the water com munications between the Mississippi river and the iiortl-eastern sea board, which ap propriations, however, failed for the time.— Since then, upon a call of the greatest re spectability, a convention has been called at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose proceedings is contained in a memo rial address to the President and Congress, and which 1 now have the honor to lay before you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its own v,ay, I do not entertain a doubt, while it i- submitted entirely to your wisdom as to wnat can be now done. Aug mented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific road, under auspices so favorable to its rapid progress and completion. Enlarged facilities of navigation become a palpable need to the great roads. 

AGRICULTURE. I transmit my annual report of the (Jomtnis siou of the Department of Agriculture, ask ing your attention to developments in that vital interest of the nation. THE War FOR THE UNION. When Congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly twenty months and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results. The re bellion had been pressed back into reduced limits, yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad, was not satis factory, and with other signs, lie* popular elections, then Just past, indicated uneasi ness, while, amid much that w as cold and me nacing, the kindest words coming from Eu rope were uttered in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender. Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such attacks from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European gov ernments anything hopeful upon this subject. THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. The Emancipation Proclamation which was issued in September, was running its as signed period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that col ored men of suitable condition would be re ceived into the war service. The policy of emancipation and of employing black sol diers, gave to the future anew aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt continued in uncertain conflict. Accord.ng to our political system,as a mat ter of civil administration, the General Gov ernment had no lawful power to effect eman cipate n in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a mill tary measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and if it should, the crisis of the contest would then bo presented. It came, and as was in timated, it was followed by dark and doubt ful days. PROGRESS. Eleven months having been passed we are permitted to take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still further back and by the complete opening of the Mississippi river, the country dominated over by the re bellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practicable communication between them.— 'lonnessee and Arkansas have been substan tially cleared of,insurgents’ control and influ ence,and the citizens in each and even owners of slaves, and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland, and Missouri, neither of which a year ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into the territories, only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it, within their own limits. Of those w ho were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full 100,000 are now in the I nited States military service,about one half of w inch number actually bear arms in the ranks of the U nited Stales forces, giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgents’ cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested it is diffi cult to say that they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the meas ures of emancipation of the blacks. These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and cotemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed, support ed, criticised and denounced, and the annual elections follow ing are highly encouraging to those whose special duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the reckoning. The crisis which threat ened to divide the friends of the Union is past. A PLAN FOR RECONSTRUCTION. Looking now to the present and future, and w ith reference to a resumption of the Nation al authority within the Slates wherein that authority Inis been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a Proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. A man is only proffered a pardon, in case be voluntarily takes the oath, the Constitution authorizes the execu tive to grant, on terms fully established by judicial and other authorities. It is also proffered that if in any ol' the States named a seat of government shall be, in the mode prescribed, set up, such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the I’idled States, and that under it the State shall, on constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government, and to protect the Slate in the cases stated, i.-> explicit and full, but why tender the benefits of ili- provision only to a State Governmeu' set up in this particular way V This section of the Constitution contemplates a case w here in the element within a State, favorable to a R> publican Government in the Union, may be 100 feeble for an opposite and hostile ele ment external to, and even within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now- dealing. An attempt to guar bat • . i protect a revived State Govern ment, constructed in whole or in preponder ating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be pro tected, is simply absurd. There must be a , test by which to separate opposing elements —a as to build only from the sound, and that tt st is a sufficient!) liberal one w hich accepts a- sound whoever will make a sworn recan tation of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to require as a u. st of admission to the political body, an oath of al h-glance to the Constitution of the United At ales and to the Inion under it, why not al so to the laws, and the proclamations in regard to slavery;- These laws and proclamations w ere enacted and put forth for the purpos- of a.d ing in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their fullest effect, there L..d to be a pledge for their maiutainance. fn myjudg ment they have aided, and will further aid, the cause for which they were enacted and put forth. To give up tiiis principle would be not oi.lv to relinquish a lever of power, but would I -3o e a cruel and astounding breach <4 laitn. 1 mav add. at this point that, while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt tn retract or modify the emancipation proclama tion. nor shall I return to slavery any person who is fre by the terms of the proclamation or by any act of Congress. For tho-e and other resolutions it is thought best that the support of these provisions shall be included in the oath,and it is believed that the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and the restoration of for feited lights, which he has a clear constitu tional power to withhold altogether, or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest ior tha public interest. It should bo observed -also that this part ol the oath ;S subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legis lation and the supreme judicial decision. The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any honorable temporary state arrangement fhr the freed people, is made w ith the view of possibly modifying the con fusion which must, at best, attend [t'j all classes by a total revolution of labor through out Uie revolted states. It is hoped lin t the already deeply afflicted people iu those -tales may fie somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction to this extent, if this vital matter be left to themselves, whih no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition. The suggestion iu the proclamation ;-s to uudntailing tiie political frame-work of the Stater or what is called “reconstruction,” is made in the hope that it may do good without the danger of doing harm. It will save Tabor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation now upon this subject V This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be de layed too long, or be taken too soon. In some States tne elements of a resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive, apparently for w ant of a rallying point or plan ol action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that ol" A t and if A and B should agree, how can they know that the General Government here w ill respect their plans V By the Proclamation a plan is pre sented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This mav bring them to action sooner than they other wise would. The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the danger of committal on points w hich could be more safely left to future develope iin-nt. Care has been taken to shape the doc ument so as to avoid embarrassment from this source. In saving that certain classes will be pardoned, w ith their right restored, it is not said that other classes, on other terms, will never be included. In saying that a reconstruction will be accepted if pre sented in a specified way, it is not said that it will never be accepted in any other way. 

EMANCIPATION. Ihe movements lor emancipation iu seve ral of the States not included in the emanci pation proclamation are matters of profound congratulation, and while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly said upon this subject, my general views anil leelings remain unchanged, and 1 trust Cou gr iss w ill omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to the great consult;mil lion. TRIBUTE TO SOLDIERS AND SAILOR?. In the midst ot other cares, how. im portant, we must not lose sight ol tin tact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power alone can w e look for any thing to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power w ill not again overrun them. Until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction, hence our chief efforts must be directed to the army and navy who have thus far done their hard er part so nobly and well. It mav be es teemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to their indispensable arms we do also honorably encourage gallant men, from the commander to the sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more than all others, the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and perpetuated.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Bj the President. AS m. 11. Seward, Secretary of Statu XXWIII rOXfiRESS—FIRST SESSION. Washington, Dec. 7. House.— At noon Etheridge, the Clerk, called the House to order, ami said he would proceed to c 11 the roll of names of sat h members onlv, whose credentials show that they were regularly elected in accordance with the laws of their state and the United States. The Clerk then read the roll of members from all the States excepting Maryland, West Virginia, Oregon, Missouri, and Kansas. Mr. Stevens, of Penn., desired that the credentials of all those w hose names were not on the roll be read. The Clerk said he had placed on the roll the names ol those whose credentials bore evidence in accordance with the law passed by this House in March last. Mr. \\ ashburue asked whether there were any contestants of seats. The Clerk replied that there were three nr lour from Missouri, one Iroin \ indnia and one from Kentucky as lie rteollectcO. Mr. Stevens repeated his request.

Si ntatires nj ihf t iiited At at' i oj America in Cvn~ •jrtss assembled. That before the first meeting of the next Congress, and every su! sequent Congress, the Clerk of the next preceeding House of Repre sentatives shall make a roll of the Kepreseuta t'ves elect, and place thereon the names of all per sons. and of such persons only, whose credentials show that they were regularly elected in accord auce with the laws of their States respectively, or the laws of the I'nited States. At the request of Mr. Stevens the Clerk read the form of the credentials of the Mis souri members which he had ruled out for informality. Mr. Dawes offered a resolution that the names of the Maryland delegation placed on the rolls of the House and moved the pre vious question, which was seconded. Mr. J. C. Allen moved to lay the resolution on the table. The question was taken on Mr. Allen’s motion to lay Mr. Dawes resolution on the table and it was decided in the negative— yeas 74, nays 04 ; which caused much ap plause from the galleries, and on the tioor of the House. Mr. Dawes demanded a vote on his resolu tion, which was adopted, followed by ap plause. So the names of the Maryland dele gates were placed on the roll. The names of the members from Missouri, Oregon, Kansas, Virginia and West Virginia wore directed to be placed upon the roll. Mr. Stevens then asked that the credentials of the Louisiana members —Messrs. Beal, Coltman and Baker—bo read. The creden tials state that the election was in accord ance with the Constitution and laws of Loui siana, and that said election was held on the 2d of November last. The credentials of the Louisiana members are signed by “J. L. Riddle, Governor of Louisiana.” Mr. Stevens moved that the n: me- of the Louisiana members be stricken from the rolls. Mr. Brooks said the House could elect a Speaker without the names of these Louisi ana gentlemen being stricken off the rolls. Mr. Stevens protested against their admis sion, hut in order to facilitate the organiza tion of the House, L<; would withdraw his motion for the present, and again offer it when the Louisiana members were to be •worn in. Mr. Washburn moved that the House pro ceed to the election of a Speaker viva voce, which was agreed to. Mr. Washburn nominated Mr. S. Colfax. Mr. Pendleton nominated Mr. Samuel Cox. Messrs. Pendleton, Dawes, Wadsworth, and Pomeroy, were appointed tellers to con duct the election. The House then proceed ed to vote with the following result: Whole number of votes, 181 ; necessary to a choice, 92 ; Colfax, 101 ; Cox, 42 ; King, 4 ; Midlo ry. 10; Stebbins, 8 ; Dawson, 12; Blair, 2; Stiles, 1. The Clerk declared Mr. Colfax duly and legally elected. The announcement was greeted with vociferous applause. Messrs. Dawson and Cox were appointed to conduct the Speaker to the chair. The Speaker, on taking the chair, delivered a brief, eloquent, and patriotic address, which was received with general applause. The members of the House were then sworn in. The names of the members from Louisiana being called, Mr. Stevens objected to their being sworn in. Considerable dis cus-ion ensued, when Mr. Stevens offered a resolution that their credentials be referred to the committee on elections. Mr. Allen moved to lay the matter on the table. This was lost by IU7 to 74. The resolution of Mr. Stevens was then adopted by 100 to 74. The Clerk then proceeded to administer the oath tc the delegates from the several Territories. The House then adjourned. Senate —The Vice President called the Senate to order at noon. The credentials of Messrs. Willey and Van Winckle, Senators elected from W< -t Vir ginia, were presented by Sen. Collamer. The credentials of Mr. Conness, of Califor nia, were presented by Sen. Nesmith, and the credentials of Mr. Henderson, of Mo., I , Sen. Foote. Messrs. Conness and H< nder son were qualified and took the oath of lov alty prescribed by the last Congress. Sen. Davis rose with a question of the right of the gentlemen from West Virginia to take a seat. He held that there was con stitutionally and legally no such state ae West Virginia; therefore there could be no Sena tors Irom ?uch State. His object was simple to put on record his objections. He believed the old Stale to be intact and that this whole thing is a flagrant violation of the Constitu tion. After debate. Senator Davis, as a test ques tion moved that the oath of office be admin istered to the gentlemen from West Virginia, which was carried by yeas 30, nays r> ; the nays being Buckalew, Davis, Hendricks, Mc- Dougal, and Powell. On motion of Sen. Foote, a resolution as adopted appointing a committee of three, in connection with a committee on the part of the House, to wait upon the President of the United States, and inform him of the readi ne.-s of Congress to receive his annual mes sage. Senators Foote, Trumbull and Nesmith were appointed. Sen. Foote offered a resolution for the classification of the Senators from West Vir ginia by the usual means, drawing by lot. w hich was adopted.

Grant, in ti e name of the people of the United State* This was passed unanimously, without a w ord of u.-bate or explanation. Mr. Cox said he desired to offer a resolu tion respectfully requesting the President 'to take immediate steps for the exchange of our prisoners in the prisons of the South, and that he communicate all correspondence in the War Department relative to the exchange of prisoners. After some discussion the pol lution was laid over. Mr. Arnold gave notice of bills to prohibit slavery forever in the territory included in the President’s emancipation proclamation; also to repeal so much ot the enrollment act as authorized the discharge of a person draft ed on the payment of Shoo. Senate.—Senator Wilson, of Mass., sub mitted a resolution that the committee on Military Affairs inquire what legislation is necessary to facilitate the payment of back pay and pensions of deceased soldiers, ic.

Senator Sherman called up his resolution that the Judiciary Committee inquire and re port whether Ivobt. \\ ilsor. was still a Senator from Missouri. Senator Trumbull moved to amend the res olution by declaring that Wilson was not en titled to a seat in the Senate, which was agreed to, and the resolution as amended was adopted. The Clerk of the House appeared and an nounced that the House had organized, and appointed a committee to wait upon the Pres ident, with the Senate committee, to inform him that both Houses were ready lor business. Senator W ilsun, of Massachusetts, gave notice of a bill to increase the bounty for volunteering, and to make an appropriation for the same. I’KOri.
