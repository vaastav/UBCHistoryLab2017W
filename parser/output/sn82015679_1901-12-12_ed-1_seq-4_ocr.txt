In establishing permanent trade rc la tions with Cuba, thi.s government should re member that a chief source of trouble tin- der Spaniah rule were the economic burdens imposed by Spain. The opinion prevails in Washington that owing to the divergent views of members of the banking and currency committee, nearly every one of whom has a different plan, there will be no financial legislation this session of Congress. When the Federation of Labor refused to be drawn into a tight against machinery by the Cigar Makers I'nion it made a declaration that labor-saving machinery is not inimical to labor. The machine has ben a leading element in establishing an eight-hour day, which the leaders of the federation seem to realize. Senator Mason, of Illinois, has intro duced a bill making the surviving officers. privates, widows and children of the Chi cago Dragoons eligible for pensions. The Dragoons were an independent command during the civil war. and are said to have served ninety elays, though it is not stated where, nor whether on sea or land. The Washington correspondent of the Louisville Courier-Journal is alarmed be cause Kentucky has not a member on the xi-jw rivers and harbors committee. It is leared that some of the rt mote "deestricts" traversed by mountain streams may not cet their usual allowance for removing Imaginary snags and creating impossible channels. Jt is suggested that whatever measure of reciprocity may be granted to Cuba there should be a provision that, in order to se cure the preferential rates, goods must be carried in American or Cuban vessels. "With the enormous trade that is likely to develop between th two countries It Is believed this provision would tend to de velop shipbuilding In both. The Democratic Chicago Chronicle does not believe that the disfranchisement of the colored voters in Alabama will insure fair elections hereafter, yince the long habit of false counting to defeat negroes will be continued by those in power to de feat white men. The Chronicle desires a beneficial law" which will cause the en forcement of the fourteenth amendment. The chairman of the tloebe! reward com- mission has called a meeting on the 1'Jth Just, "for the purpose of passing on some claims presented for the conviction of Henry Youtsey and to arrange some mat ters before the coming term of the Frank lin Circuit Court." The manhuntcrs are evidently after a first dividend of the JU.oi) appropriated by the Legislature. The ways and means committee In the House lost no time in preparing a special tariff bill for the Philippines in conformity tvith the recent decision of the Supreme Court, which held that until such bill was nacted by Congress trade between the "United States and the islands must be free both ways. The decision of the court had nothing to do with rates, but it settled a principle. Tlv present ship subsidy bill Is a distinct lmpre vement on he original." says the Pittsburg Dispatch. "but the feeling Hgainst any measure to which the name pubsldy can be attached is likely to pr. vent many people from seeing the differ ence.

.NATION Hi 1)1 TV. A Democratic exchange thinks "there has been a sad falling off in the spirit of the I'nited States government between the time when It protested against the persecution of Kossuth and hi.s brave Hungarian fol lowers and the present, when it refuses to lift a tinger or say a word in favor of the Uoers." The same sentiment has found ex pression in other forms, the inference lein that the attitude and policy of the United State towards foreign wars, revolutions or rebellions was very different fifty years ago from what it Is to-day. This is not true. Whatever may have been the senti ment of the people, the traditional policy of the government has always been noninter ference In the domestic wars or revolutions of other countries, excepting in the case of Cuba, where the conditions: at our very door became so abhorrent as to make inter vention a duty. There has been a good deal of misleading talk about what this government is. alleged to have paid or done in the case o? Kos suth. As a matter of fact, it neither sa'id nor did anything- even remotely suggesting intervention. The main difference between the present situation and that of Kossuth's time is that popular sympathy was far more unanimous and strongly with the Hungarian revolutionists than It now Is with the Doers. People have a rißht to feel as they please and to express their enti- ments, but governments must be careful. While the Hungarian revolution was in progress President Taylor authorized an agent of the government, then in Kurope, to investigate the situation and report upon the prospects of Hungary gaining its inde pendence. In his message of 1 S 13 the Pres ident said he had done this "in order to be prepared, upon the contingency of the es tablishment by her of a permanent govern ment, to be the first to welcome independ ent Hungary into the family of nations." He added: "The United States did not at any time interfere in the contest, but the feelings of the Nation were strongly en listed in the cause and by the sufferings of a brave people who had made a gallant though unsuccessful effort to be free." This, of course, related to popular sympa thy. After the revolution had failed and Kossuth was a fugitive and prisoner in Turkey, with a prospect of being surren dered to the Austrian authorises, the United States joined with England in ask ing for his release, and subsequently, in ac cordance with a resolution of Congress,- it sent a warship to bring him to the United States as the Nation's guest. He arrived here in December, 1S51, and was everywhere treated with the greatest distinction by the people, but he received no recognition from the government. His visit was the occasion of a vast 'amount of spread-eagle oratory, denunciation of foreign tyrants, etc., and he himself delivered many wonderfully elo ejuent speeches, but the government de clined to give him any aid or encourage ment. He visited Washington and was re ceived by President Fillmore, but he was notified in advance that in any remarks he might make he. should say nothing of aid or Intervention on the part of this govern ment. He disregarded this suggestion to an extent that called from the President an explicit disavowal of any purpose on the part of the government to give cither ma terial or moral aid to a new Hungarian re volt. No doubt it was this Incident and Kossuth's resentment at his failure to re ceive any government aid or recognition that led President Fillmore in his annual message of 1SL2 to say: It has been the uniform policy of this government, from its foundation to the present day, to abstain from all interfer ence in the domestic affairs of other na tions. Hut it is now said by some that this policy must be changed. Kurope is no longer separated from us by a voyage of months, but steam navigation has brought her within a few days' sail of our shores. We see more of her movements and take a deeper interest in her contro versies. It is said that we ought to inter fere between contending sovereigns - and their subjects for the purpose of over throwing the monarchies of Kurope and es tablishing in their place republican Institu tions. It is said that we have heretofore pursued a different course from a sense of our weakness, but that now our conscious strength dictates a change of policy and that it is consequently our duty to mingle in these contests and aid those who are struggling for liberty. The President characterized this as "a most seductive but dangerous appeal to the generous sympathies of freemen," and pro ceeded to combat it at considerable length. He jyiid It was "an imperative duty of the United States not to interfere in the gov ernment or internal policy ot other na tions." and he drew very distinctly the line between popular sympathy and government Interference or meddling. These events are Instructive because they throw light on the traditional policy of the United States not to interfere in the domes tie affairs of other nations. We would not tolerate it in our own case, and should not do It in any other, either by word or deed. It follows, of course, that the action of a recent pro-P.oer meeting in Chicago, urging the government to change its attitude of strict neutrality and nonintervention In the Hrltlsh-Hoer war. and the action of all similar meetings, should be Ignored by the government. We have problems enough of our own to solve without meddling with thoe of other nations. One of the first of national duties i to mind our own business. A 

GKVKHAI- MIS.IMti:ili:Mo. In a communication published in Tues day's isuc regarding beet sugar the writer seems to labor under some misapprehen sion as to the definition of protection and the duty on sugar. He eleclares that the prices of iron and steel have been cheaper under a protective tariff than before these articles were protected. That is true; and it is true because the iron industry has U-en so developed that our manufacturers are able not only to supply the home- mar ket, but have thousands of tons to export. It was an industry which protection could develop. It was not the protective tariff that made the iron cheaper when it was adopted, as he assumes, but the vast eiuan tlty made In this country and the better methods of production. Protectionists stood for the protection of iron, glass, rjrlhrnwarr. etc . hfi-aiiio thv mu w -.ia - - - .-v J " f aco. that We Could supply the hum marut after a reasonable period. The real pur- In the same connection the writer says: 1 1 II ... . , , - .. t-i lltl !l f t 1 'T e an nnu m-u ruai mm ! the passage of the Dingby law," his ns- , sumption being that the sugar duty is I lower in the Dingle y tariff than in the ! one which preceded it. As a matter of ' fact, the duty on raw sugar is a little I higher under the Dingley law than it was I under the (Jnrman law. On sugar or any other article of which the country pro ducts but a small part of the quantity con sumed the duty is added to the import price and is paid by the consumer. To-day the duty on sugar is the greatest pro fiucer of revenue; in the tariff law. With the exemption of three years under the McKinley tariff law, when raw sugar was on the free list and a high bounty was paid on home-raised sugar, raw sugar has always paid a very high duty, rang ing from rJ to KJ per cent. In all these years that high duty has not stimulated sugar production at home to any extent. Very little if any more cane sugar is pro duced now than in IST.. The beet sugar industry has been agitated since 1V73. when two or three Eastern States offered pre miums to encourage it. In Germany and France, where labor is cheap and women work in the fields, the industry has been stimulated both by prohibitory duties tnd bounties. It does not seem to get hold in this country. Twehe years ago the Agri cultural Department took it in hand. The result last year was, as our correspondent says, 150.0O0.Oi0 pounds, or 73.0"O tons of sugar or about as much sugar as Indiana consumed during II. The Agricultural Department has devoted more attention to the beet-sugar industry than to any one special feature. At the present time it is not necessary to discuss the proposition to put susar on the free list, even if the correspondent de clares that the Journal Is for letting in Cuba's sugar free of duty. The Journal has not declared in favor of a. reduction of the general duty on sugar. We cannot get along without the sugar revenue, and it is desirable that the beet sugar experi ment should have more time. What the Journal proposes, and what the President favored in his message, is that a reciprocal treaty be made with Cuba so that the duty le reduced on raw sugars (not one-fourth of the ejuantity consumed) 12 or 20 per cent. It could not affect the beet-sugar industry, whose production in any year has not been eeiual to the increased consumption from year to year. What the Journal has said of the yield of beets to the acre and the qunntity required to make a ton of refined sugar is the statement of tho expert who made the calculations for the sugar tariff, and whose professional duties led him to be accurate In estimates regarding sugar . The correspondent who is so hasty to as sail the Journal should have been carcftd to make his own statements harmonize lie declares that the journal is wrong when it says, on the statement of an ex pert, that three men are needed to cultl vate an acre of beets, but, when speaking of the industry in Michigan, ho says that 70,000 acres give employment to 21ö,0u0 men. which is just three' men to an acye. His general assumption to the effect that the lower tariff on iron and steel has caused the prices to advance is simply absurd. A man who assumes to give information should know that there has been no ma terial change in the duty on iron and steel since the enactment of the McKinley law The present duties are essentially the same as those of the Democratic Gorman tariff The proposition of Secretary Gage that the banks secure their circulation in part by deposits of greenbacks is receiving con slderable attention. His objection to the greenbacks in circulation is that while a gold reserve of $15Vna(n) is sufficient to float the outstanding lttJ.O'O.OX) of green backs in prosperous times the notes might be presented in a season of pronounced stress In eiuantities which might wipe out the reserve, as it did during Mr. Cleve land's last term. On the other hand, some of those who have examined Mr. Gage's plan cannot see the difference in the ef fect upon the treasury whether the present condition remains or the notes are the property of banks. Ultimately the United States must redeem the notes, and if the banks get in a place where they must use the notes, the government would be com pelled to redeem them. There would be something in this did not the secretary's plan seem to involve the association of a large number of banks In a manner to pro tect their circulation. For that purpose all the banks would be taxed according to the secretary's plan. The Journal does not know what Is In the minds of bank ers, but it does not seem that banks which are strong and conservatively managed would form any plan which would make them remotely responsible for the circula tion of banks which are not on so sound a basis. 'The law relative to the use of greenbacks has been so amended that the greater danger experienced by the Cleve land administration by being compelled to pay out greenbacks when redeemed has been obviated by the provision of the Over Mrcet act that greenbacks, when once re deemed, cannot be put into circulation again without the deposit of an equivalent amount of gold. A Scotch member of the Uritish Parlia ment who traveled in this country twenty live years ago says he discovered a strlk ing dissimilarity between Americans and Britons In that the former preferred new and progressive ways to obi ones, while the latter were the reverse. He says the En glishman's ereeel in trade is, "As it was in the- beginning, is now and ever shall I)1," while the American is constantly on the lookout for improved methods. The En . gli.-h doctrine is all right in the prayer book, but it dots not apply to trade. Th c harges made by Dr. Itoed, of Cin cinnati, relative to the responsibility for wholesale sickness in military camps dur ing the Spanish-American war are too serious and e xplhit to be ignored. Com ing from an irresponsible person they might be overlooked, but Dr. Heed is tho retiring president of the American Medical Association and was a memb r of the com mission appointed by President McKinley to investigate the condition of the camps.

The revival meetings were so wild and noisy that the staid congregation of Dr. Withrow was shocked and scandalized. The testimony before the Hoard of Safety yesterday would lead to a belief that in some of the fire companies there Is a de plorable lack of discipline and an urgent necessity that some authority be exercised. The testimony showed that members of en gine and hose companies Indulge in abusive language toward each other. This comes ttecause men imagine they have "pulls" and can retain their places whatever they do. When all the men understand that each stands on his own record as a fireman, and that he will be dismissed when he neg lects his duty or is not civil, there will be no trouble with the fire department.

AN AGRARIAN SPEAKS COLWT VON IvAMTZ 11ISCISSES THE TARIFF 3IEASIRE. Wnnt Mm Adoption Because He Fenr the American Peril' Herr Singer Calls It a. II ii uif er Tax. BERLIN, Dec. 11. Continuing the tariff debate in the Reichstag to-day. Count Von Kanitz, the. Agrarian leader, eleclared that the "shaping of Germany's commercial re lations with America will be the most im portant task before the country for the next decade." He further declared that the United States, Great Britain and France were by no means convinced of the expediency of concluding commercial treaties of long duration. Germany must not repeat the mistake of not denouncing in time the existing commercial and most favored nation treaties. It would be epulte wrong. Count Von Kanitz declared, to abolish or reduce the duties on iron, and he Intended to propose the establishment of al valorem duties against countries Im posing ad valorem duties. Count Von Kanitz said the present status of commercial relations between Germany and the United States was quite unsatis factory, and that the Saratoga treaty of 11 was the sorriest achievement ever scored by German diplomacy. "The Amer- lean predominance in commerce," said the Agrarian leader, "is a danger to Europe, and it is quite possible that a few Ameri can millionaires may buy our commercial fleet. In that case German captains and seamen would be in the pay of the United States. A tariff war with this country would be- impossible because the United States sells us far more than she buys from us." Herr Singer, Social Democrat, asked if the Emperor and princes, who are large land owners, were willing to bear the stig ma of profiting by "bread usury," which the tariff certainly fostered. He did not think his Majesty wished , to profit by a "hunger" tax, but the bill had already created hatred and excitement in the minds oMhe masses, who were apt to see a sin ister connection between protection and land ownership. The remarks of Herr Singer enlivened the debate considerably. He quoted fig ures showing the great profits derived by German princes from the grain duties. He was called to order by Count Von Stolberg Wernigerode, vice president of the Reich stag, who presieled at to-day's session, .for introducing the name of his Majesty Em jxror William Into the debate. The minister of agriculture. General Von Podbielski. took strong exception to Herr Singer's language. He declared that the Social Democrats were trying 10 unaer mine the government, asserted that the government had done its best to arrange an equitable tariff schedule ami said that it inteneled to arrive at a decision upon the course it had mapped out. 

OPPOSED TO THE GROUT BILL. Pnckerm and Reef Growers NVIII Fight the Measure if Enaeted. CHICAGO, Dec. 11. Hon. John W. Springer, president of the National Live Stock Association, returned to-day from Washington, where on Monday he had an interview with President Roosevelt on mat ters now before Congress and in which the stock men ef the country are interested. Mr. Springer expressed himself, as fully satistled that the stock and Irrigation In terests will re-ceive just consideration. Speaking of the Grout bill, introduced in Congress last week, Mr. Springer expressed himself strongly against the measure, and said: "The dairy interests have brought all the ir Influence to bear to secure an im meellate passage of this bill, and I will not be surprised to see the measure a law at an early day." Speaking for the packing Interests and. as he said, the beef growers of the West and the cotton raisers of the South, Mr. Springer declared there was but nc way in which the measure could be defeated, and that whs for every man Identified with the interests opposed to the (Jrout bill to write to the senators representing his State and his representatives in Congress demanding that they vote aeainst it. Mr Springer eleclared that, should th bill be ctme a law. it would be contested through the Supreme Court ef the United States. Work of the Creeel Revivers.

OTHER COMMITTEE MEETINGS JUDICIARY TO PREPAR E AX ANARCHIST MEASIHE. ATI- Hepburn's Cnnnl Hill t He Ilcnortcel Soon Dr. Sternberg;' Reply Dr. ReeeP Statement. WASIIINGTON, Dec. 11. At a meeting of the waj's and means committee to-day Chairman Payne was directed to favorably report to the House the Philippine tariff bill which the Republican members of the committee agreed upon yesterday. The report will be made Friday, and the bill will be considered in the House next Tues day, with a vote at 4 o'clock on Wednes day, instead of Tuesday, as at first planned. Some surprise was occasioned at the fail ure of the minority of the committee to ask for a division and vote on the question of reporting the bill. In the abbcnce of such request no vote was recorded. Numer ous" conferences of Democratic members were held prior to the meeting of the com mittee. It developed that the four Louisi ana members now in the city Representa tives Robertson, Meyer, Davey and Rans- dell were favorable to the bill, and that the two Louisiana members out of the city Messrs. Broussard and Brezell probably would favor it. The Louisiana members made no concealment of the fact that the rugar industry of their State required the measure of protection against Philippine SUgar which the majority bill gave by ap- plying the Dingley rates. Under these cir cumstances the minority members reached no united decision as to opposing the bill, and although there will be a minority re port opposing the measure on general grounds the Louisiana members will hold themselves individually free to vote for the bill. Secretary Gage has written to Chairman Payne pointing out that the bill should provide for a rebate when articles exported from this country contain ingredients im ported from the Philippines on which duty already has been paid. The bill probably will be amended to conform to this sugges tion. Judge Ray. chairman of the Judiciary committee, has called a meeting of that committee for to-morrow, when the im portant questions of restricting anarchy and Anarchists and of forming an anti trust measure would be discussed infor mally. In view of the President's, recom mendations, both of these subjects are considered of the first importance. Many plans for dealing with anarchy are be fore the committee, and Mr. Ray is draft ing a measure combining their best fea tures. As to the anti-trust legislation, conferences will be held with the President and Speaker Henderson with a view of determining along what lines it is de sirable to proceed with this subject. Chairman Hepburn has called a meeting of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce for Friday, when some plans for isthmian canal legislation will be for mulated. Mr. Hepburn said to-day that ho saw no reason why the Nicaragua canal bill could not be reported to the House by next Tuesday. But he will not ask the House to act upon the measure until after the pending Hay-Pauncefote treaty is rati fied by the Senate. ft 

3PLAIRIX OT PRESENT. Cnnens of Democratic Senators Com mittee Change Opposed. WASHINGTON, Dee. 11. The Democratic senators to-day held their first caucus of the present cession. Its purpose was to consider committee assignments, but the occasion was more than ordinarily signifi cant because of the general attendance on the caucu3. All the senators elected as Democrats, with the exception of Senator McLaurin, of South Carolina, were present, as were all the senators who were elected as Silver Republicans or Populists. All tho independents, except Senator Teller, of Colorado, had entereet the Democratic cau cus held Just before adjournment last March, but Senator Teller then remained away. He was present, however, at to- day's conference and participated in the proceeaings. The caucus was called at the instance of Senator Jones, of Arkansas, who stateei that he had thought It possible that the new senators might want to make some changes in the officers of the caucus. There was. however, a general expression of satis faction with the present officials, and Sena tor Jones was re-elected unanimously chair man of the caucus. The old committee on order of business also was reappointed, and the one vacancy on that committee was filled by the selection of Senator Dubois, of Idaho, who was the choice of all the Western members of the caucus. During the proceedings Senator Tillman suggested that there should be frequent conferences and a continued effort to agree upon the main features of all political con troversies. There was a quite general re sponse to this suggestion, and the opinion was fairly unanimous that the party should present a united front, permitting no more straggling than was absolutely necessary. Senator Jones presented a statement from the Republican committee on committees outlining its wishes as to the committee as signments, from which it appeared that the Republicans were anxious to increase the Republican membership of several com mittees and to decrease the Democratic membership of a few of tho committees. xh0 most important change suggested by them was that the Republicans should be allowed to aeid one member to their side of the committee on commerce, while the Democrats should agree to surrender one of the places on that committee held by them. The committee as now constituted includes ten Republican members and seven Democratic members. It was decided vig orously to resist this innovation; also the other changes proposed. 

MEDICAL COUPS VACANCIES. Dr. Sternher h Reply te Dr. Heed's Criticisms. WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Surgeon Gen eral Sternberg, of the army, said to-day in reference to that part of the speech ef Dr. Alfred Reed, the retiring president of the American Medical Association, at Marlon, CD., last night, which alleged nn inability to fill vacancies in the army medical corps: "Dr. Reeel is evidently misinformed with reference to the Idling of vacancies in the medical corps ef the army. The corps was increased by Conuress at Its last session by the addition f two e olone Is, two lieu tenant colonels, ten majors and 113 assis tant surgeons. This increase was out of proportion greater in the lower grades than in the higher and in the ahsene-e- of additional legislation would make promo tion very slow for the fifty or sixty assis tant surgeons at the- foot of the list of those' appointed.

WASHINGTON, Doc. ll.-The State De partment has been o'jlied te eleclino to be drawn Into the elisvussion of the various projects for geiKL-.l arbitration now pend ing before the congress of American repub lics in Mexico. The issue presented in sub stance is compulsory arbitration versus voluntary arbitration, and Chile is bitterly opposed to the former, which Is believed to have the support of a majority of the delegates. As this subject threatens to disrupt the congress, and the delegates seem unable to reach an agreeme nt 'among themselves, several appeals have been made to the government here to cast the influence of the United States in a manner to determine the issue. This, however, the State Department has declined to do. tak ing the ground that having fully and prop erly instructed its leb gates to the con gress, it cannot interfere with them in their actions upon a subject before the congress. nrevet for the Trenldent.

The British government has, it is said, been very indulgent in this case, and there is every reason to believe it will continue to be so. The State Department some time ago took steps to secure the co-operation of the Spanish government in the atljustment ef claims of American citizens, mostly nat uralized in this case, pending before the Spanish Claims Commission. The Due De Arcos was the medium of communication, and the Spanish government agreed to afford any assistance within its power to prevent the allowance of fraudulent claims. The government counsel has been duly notified of this attitude of the Spanish gov ernment. The nineteenth annual convention cf the American Forestry Association began here to-day.

STILL A MYSTERY NO EXPLANATION OF THE ASSAULT ON MRS. AHA G. DENNIS. "It's a Woman," "It's In a Hook." Twn of the Dressmaker's Inco herent Expressions. WASHINGTON', Dec. H.-Mrs. Ada Gil bert Dennis, the fashionable dressmaker found mysteriously assaulted in her apart ments yesterday morning. Is hovering be tween life and death to-day. She-slfbwed some improvement this morning, but the chance for recovery is very slight. "It's a woman," "It's in a book," and "I'll tell you all about it," are the only co herent words that the detectives sitting by her side have been able to distinguish. These were spoken when she apparently realized what she said. The detectives are not yet ready to announce a motive for the crime. William II. Johnson, of Gettysburg, Pa., a nephew of the victim, arrived to-day, and after being admitted to the sick room went to police headquarters, leaving there subsequently with a detective. The hospi tal attendants are keeping the patient very eiuiet and hope she may be able to give some Information by to-morrow. A small, edd-fashioned hatchet, which probably has been used by the family for many years, was found by detectives to lay in a closet in the room of the elde r Mrs. Dennis, mother-in-law of the injured wom an. This room is in the rear part of the second floor. There were indications of rust and other stains upon both the handle and blade, and these were analyzed by Chemist Hurd, of the health department. The analysis, however, failed ti eiisclose the presence e)f blood stains on the weapon and the; police attach no significance to the finding of it. Up to a late hour to-night there had been absolutely no developments tending to throw any "light on the mystery which surrounds the assault. The victim s condi tion remains unchanged. The physicians think that if she lives for forty-eight hours there may be pome hope ef her recovery. She is conscious at times, but not very rational. Every word she utters in these perii'ds of lucidity is carefully noted by the watchers in the hope that something will be said that will assist the detectives in their work.

These letters remind tho Filipino loaders in the lidd thdt the war lias destroyed innumerable homes and devastated large territories, all of which, while it abundantly proves the tenacity of tho insurgents and their faith in their cause, does not remove the fact that the operations of American soldiers through out the islands daily demonstrate the reso lution eif the people of the United States to make their sovereignty respected throughout the archipelago.

Tho grandmother, godmother and daughter were shot t e death in the vicinity ef the capture; Labrador, his wile jind the pediceman were taken to an iso lated spot and killed with bolos. The brother maele his escape, incidentally Oliver and his band robbed Iabrador of seve-nty-elght carts, Si pesos and other articles. General Chaffee criticised the proceedings on the grouiul that the accused was charged solely with the murder of Labra dor, assault upon him with Intent to kill, ar.d robbery, while the murder of three women, one small girl and the policeman were not Included In tho charge. A band of Tulisanes armed with boles, rifles and daggers killed deren members of the Echevarria family at Naro. Mas bate, on Aug. 14, 11 i. for the sole reason that the victims were Spaniards. Two members of the band were brought to trial and were sentenced to Ik hangcel. But in view of the fact that the more- responsible participants In this crlnue already had paid the death penalty the sentences were com muted by General Chaffee to Ii f imprison ment. Ygnecio Slaotong, an insurgent leader operating against the American govern ment after having taken the oath of allegiance, was sentenced to hang for mur dering a native woman susjected of friend liness to the United States. In his annual report made public a few days ago General Chaffee, military Gov ernor of the Philippines, assigned as one of the principal factors in the prolongation of the warfare in the Philippines the terri ble vengeance viflted on any native- who Id even suspected of f riendllr.e-ss to the Ameri r;m cause. In passing upon the cum- of a Filipino recently trieel by cenirt-martial fejr such a crime General Chaffee ald: "As guerrilla and all other bandit chiefs have no shadow of lawful authority to take the lives of the inhabitants of thee isl.inds. and as it is the duty of the United State s to protect all in the enjoyment of their lives and property the warninsr. olteii given, will be repeate-el until all shall hed it that both the chie fs who-emler and the followers who oty their orders to do mur der must, upon conviction there-of. expect to suffer the extreme penalties eif the law."
