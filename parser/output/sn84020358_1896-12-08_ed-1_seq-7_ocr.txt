Massachusetts Follows the Precedent Established by Connecticut on the Subject. A recent Issue of the Worcester (Mass.) Spy has the following on the subject of trolley railroads crossing the. tracks of steam railroads at grade: "Our state railroad commissioners took action for the public Interest in forbidding a trolley company to cross the tracks of the Consolidated Railroad company at grade in Leominster. In doing this, they have followed the pre cedent established by Connecticut, which has had for several years a law requiring a separation of grades at points where trolley lines cross steam roads. The principle of this law Is to protect the lives of passengers on both systems by making collisions lmpossU ble. The question of competition be tween the two systems is too trivial to be considered when human lives are In jeopardy. There should be nothing to interfere with the movements of fast passenger trains on steam roads, nor should there be danger to trolley line passengers at grade crossings. The Connecticut law is a good.one for every state to enact, in connection with an equitable division of the expenses in curred in the separation of grades be tween the roads and the community." ' 

IEATH OF XATHAlf B. SASTOltD. An Old and Highly Esteemed New Haven Resident A Brother of Dr. Leonard J. Sanford and of the Lato Judge E. I. San ford. Nathan H. Sanford, .one of the best known citizens 5 and retired business men of the city, was found dead in his bed in his apartment at the New Ha ven house about 1 o'clock yesterday af ternoon. His death" was due to a com plication of diseases. He haS been in feeble health for some time, though not, it was thought, dangerously ill, and had been able to be a.bot the ho tel and to take short walks and attend to his business interests in a quiet way up to the last day of his life. Mr. Sanford retired at his usual hour on . Sunday evening as well as usual. Yesterday morning he did not appear at the breakfast table, but nothing was thought of the circumstance, as he, had not infrequently remained in his room late. On his non-appearance at dinner It was thought that he might be ill and an attendant was sent to Mr. Sanford's room. 'No answer was heard, in re sponse to the knock. The door was then opened and Mr. JSahford'9 body was found in the bed.. From the ex amination it was "seen that he had been dead several hours. ! Mr. Sanford was a brother to the late Judge E. I. Sanford and Dr. L. J. San ford, both of this city. He was con nected with the Beckley lumber firm of Water, street in. 1870 and for several years following. He then sold out his interests to Mr. Beckley and retired from active business. He kept an office in the Benedict building and was clerk and treasurer of the New Haven City Burial associ ation for the past eight years, resign ing at the association's last annual meeting held a week or two ago. He had also for years occupied, the posi tion of treasurer of the Center Church society. Mr. Sanford resided at the New Haven house for the past thirty years. 1 "" '' '' .. ': " Dr. L. C. Sanford was called from the bedside of his dying father, 5 Dr. L. J. Sanford, to the New Haven hO!is9, where he was made acquainted with the death of his uncle, and was deeply moved and almost overcome by the sad occurrence.' - Nathan H. Sanford was one of our old and most estimable New Haven family, and enjoyed to a. high degree the confidence and esteem of his fellow citizens. He was a gentleman of re finement, interested in the church with which he had so long been Identified, and by nature, and especially so In his later years, mingled but little' in the activities of social or business life. He was withal a gentleman, most affable and kindly and ever considerate of the comfort and welfare of others; and leaves a memory dear to those who best knew his true worth of character. The death of his brother, the late E. I. Sanford, judge of the superior and su preme courts of this state for many years, removed a citizen of great, use fulness and integrity of character, a citizen and lawgiver of blameless life, a gentleman whose death the public mourned. The death of Judge Sanford was a blow which long deeply affected Nathan and it is thought that his death was hastened by the critical illness of his brother, Dr. Sanford, and the knowledge that the illness of the lat ter would in all probability terminate fatally. 

WALLING FOBV. George Beaumont and child had a narrow escape from perhaps a terrible J death at the Ward street railroad crossing yesterday "morning. A freight train was switching and the conductor had just given the signal to the en gineer to back up in order to throw a car on the side track, when Beaumont started to drive across the track. Luck ily, the occurrence was seen by the conductor, who stopped the car within a few inches of the wagon. The Botsford vs. Wallace case, over right of way between their buildings on Main street, is booked for trial in New Haven to-day. Superintendent D. R. Knight, who Is 111 in Elizabeth, N.

Robert Hay, jr., of the Wallingford hotel, who has been quite ill, is on the improve. AH VLHQASr Itlll.IllKQ. Will be the Finest Athletic Club Building In the World., Among the new events odnote In New York of late was the laying of the corner stone of the new home of the New Yorlt Athletlo cub, which will cost when fully equipped a million dollars. The plans for the building depict what will undoubtedly be the finesit house of Its kind In the world, embodying as It will so many things essential to that life. The Times of yesterday gives an excellent sketch of the plans of the new structure and its equipment, ac companied with handsome illustrations showing the front elevation and the natatorlum and In addition an excel lent picture of th club's president, Mr. James Whltely, a gentleman known to many New Haven financial men, he be ing of! the well known firm of- Prince & Whltely, bankers and brokers of New York, which has a branch In New Haven managed by our esteemed townsman, Mr. C. B. Bolmer, one of whose brothers, Mr. Thomas Bolmer, Is a member of the firm and an occa sional visitor to this city. Among other interesting facts concerning this com ing splendid club house, the Times says: It will be eight stories in height, with a frontage on Central tark of 120 feet, by 100 feet on Sixth avenue, and will be 200 feet In depth on the easterly side, with a front on Forty-eighth street 20 feet wide. The distance from the side walk to the top of the cornice of the building will be 140 feet. The style will be somewhat Moresque, but will not follow It either In mass or detail very closely. The terra cotta or nament will be very rich, and the whole color scheme of the building ;has been carefully considered. The gymnasium will be loca'ed on the fourth floor, and occupy the entire park front, being 116 feet long by 58 feet wide. This immense floor space will be unbroken save by two columns on the westerly side. This floor also provides a boxing room, a wrestling room, a directors' room, office, etc. A movable stage is also provided for ex hibitions. Two stairways lead from the gymnasium floor to the gallery, which Is practically the fifth floor, and con tains a running track, sixteen laps to the mile, and seven feet wide. Adjoin ing the track are the fencing, measur ing, and lounging rooms. The gymna sium will be 30 feet high. Locker, shower, and massage rooms, and the Instructor's room will be placed1 on the sixth, floor. The main or entrance hall will be 38 feet wide, extending through the center of the building, and will be decorated In mosaic tiling and fancy marble. There will be a fine library opening from this hall. A reception room, offices, telephone rooms, and a serving room will also be situated on this floor. The promenade gallery of the natatorlum will open direct from the main hall.

A room, which promises to be the most characteristic in. the house, will be the main lounging and , smoking room, situated on the second floor in the center portion, and 38 by 48 feet' In size. The Intention Is to decorate it with club trophies, pictures, weapons, relics and implements of the sport and the chase. The billiard room, with thirteen tables, will be placed on this floor on the Sixth avenue side, and on the easterly side a spacious parlor will be provided in which will be held the art exhibitions which in the past have been so successful. On the Fifty eighth street side will be the board of governors' room, cafe, and chessroom.

President's Message Causes the Market to Slump Still Farther New York, Dec. 7. Practically all of the Interest in to-day's financial mar kets centered upon the president's an nual message, and as the document was not submitted to congress or re leased for publication until half-past one p. m., the early stock market of the day was purely perfunctory. On the publication of the message prices de clined. The three sections of the mes sage on which Wall street's curiosity was focussed were the Cuban matter, the problem of the trusts and the gov ernment's plans regarding the Pacific railroad debts. The remarks of the message on the Union Pacific foreclosure proceedings, and on the matter of legislation against the trusts, were exactly what had been expected. Still, they were interpreted as having an unfavorable bearing on the stocks concerned; therefore Union Pacific declined immediately, and Su gar certificates. Leather preferred, American Tobacco and Chicago Gas re flected similarly the professed disap pointment of the interests in these properties. The industrial shares, however, it j g 1 1 1 a 1 1 become irritated and rough, creating much discomfort and annoyance. At such times 8 11 1 I 1 ; 1 was noticeable, recovered In most In stances rather sharply. As for the ex ecutive statements on the Cuban situ ation, it was plain that the stock ex change was uncertain exactly how to take them. The president's review of the situa tion was sufficiently reserved and diplo matic to remind no one of the other re markable message of a year ago, and Washington dispatches reported con gressmen as peacefully disposed not a wholly unexpected phenomenon, since the presidential campaign is over. It was the explosion of crazy jingoism on the floor of congress, more decidedly than the Venezuelan message itself, which caused the great collapse in val ues during December, 1895. The nature of the supplementary re port of Mr. Olney did not become gen erally known on Wall street until the day's business was nearly over. There was some renewed selling of stocks on this, and in fact the market's general tendency was downward after the pub lication of the1' message. The day'9 Belling, however, was almost wholly speculative, and was obviously experi mental in its character. , .
