Secretary Sherman, in his annual re port, recommends that the rules "of the House and Senate be changed so as to prevent tho addition of general leg islation to appropriation bills. The end proposed is excellent and necessary, but the means, as is not unusual with the suggestions of Mr. Sherman, are defec tive. Rules are of no use when the very body desiring to evade them may legally suspend their operation. Mr. White of Pennsylvania, proposes a more radical remedy in the form of a consti tutional amendment which not only confines appropriation bills to their le gitimate subject matter, but gives the President the power, without vetoing the entire bill, to veto any single pro vision of such a bill. This is a change which has already been introduced into several of our State Constitutions, and it has been found to work extremely well wherever it has been adopted. It secures a very much closer and more efficient responsibility on the part of the Executive, and rob jobbers of what has heretofore been one of their most fruit ful methods of securing the passage of objectionable appropriations.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Ihe annual message sent to Congress last Monday by President Hayes is i remarkable document in many respects JNot tbe least remarkable thing about it is the fact that it is written in fairly good English, and put together with some literary skill things that are not often found in Presidential messages The first topic treated is that of the national finances. After congratulating Congress on the success of resumption. the President makes two recommenda tions : Jirst, that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to discontinue the coinage of the silver dollar ; second ly, that measures be taken at once for tne retirement or tne legal tender cur rency. On this point Mr. Hayes is par ticularly emphatic in his declarations : it is my nrm conviction that tne issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles. Tbe topic that is most elaborately treated in the message is Civil Service reform. The Administration has been so open to criticism on this point, up to this time, that it has seemed to many to have abandoned all purpose of fulfilling its pledges. President Hayes speaks now with no uncertain sound. He is as frank and positive as in his letter of ac ceptahce of the Presidential nomination, and commits himself to a definite scheme tt . i i no cannot witnaraw now witnout posi tive dishonor, and his purpose can only be to do all in his power to set in mo tion a reform that shall be thorough and permanent. He declares it to be his his plan to renew the examinations an tborized by tbe law of 1871, and calls Upon UDgress w mase me necessary appropriation for the resumption of the Commission provided for by that law. . . . . ,i . A definite law ought also to be passed, he says, forbidding the levying of po litical assessments on office-holders under any pretence whatever. If the future course of the administration shall be in accordance with the President's plan, as thus defined the friends of re form will find it not hard to Xorgrve its dallying with the matter heretofore. , Other topics of interest treated in the message are polygamy in Utah, which Congress - is urged to suppress ; fair elections throughout the country, for which all good citizens are exhorted to strive : the state and needs of the Army and Navy ; and the Indian ques tion. On this last head he approves the reports of Secretary Schurz and the -In dian Commissioner, and specially urge3 the enactment of a law enabling the Government to give uncivilized Indians a title-fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned them by allotment, and the extension to civilized Indiana of the benefits of the Home stead Act. Both of these recommenda tions ouffht bv all means to be acted o upon at once. They would go far to wards a solution of the troublesome "Indian problem." 

WASHINGTON LETTER. 1.9FEOIA& CORBESPONDENCB OF THB MONITOR. Washington, Dec. 2, 1879. The town talk is the President's mes sage, it is a document wormy or dis cussion, and everybody concedes to it the character of one of the ablest State papers for many years. The President shows tbat he is a very decided man in his opinioi and while his language pleases Uepullicans it displeases Demo crats. The points most talked about are his recommendations touching the retire ment of the legal tender circulation, and the protection of every citizens right -to the ballot. The retirement of the legal tender cur rency is not a new idea. In fact, it has been recommended by every Secretary of the Treasury for eight or ten years, and the wisest financiers say it will be adopt ed before long, whether it should be thought best to try it now or not. The matter of the ballot is a thorn in the Democratic side, and it shows that the President i3 as stout in his Republican ism as any. Ihe recommendation tnat some action be taken to break up poly gamy in Utah deserves to be heeded, and it is believed that Congress will take hold of the subject since that Utah will soon apply for admission into the Union in snort, every part or. tne message is r t . m . a worthy of a careful reading. In letters just received nere lienerai urant says it may be important for him to come to Washington before starting on his trip to Cuba. He says he has private en gagements in New York and Philadel pbia which cannot be neglected. This is interpreted to mean his talked of meeting witn tne iurupeau uayuaiiovo make arrangements for prosecuting the Isthmus Canal enterprise. The appointment of Ex-Senator Mc Crary as J udge in place of Judge Dillon, is liked on all sides. It is too bad to take out" of active politics so good a Re publican as he is, however Governor Ramsey of Minnesota, who is to be Mr. McCrary's successor, as Secretary, i3 in the city. His appointment is also much liked. The reduction of the public debt last month was not quite a million dollars. The condition of the government finances is very gratifying, in connection with the general business prosperity, busi ness men as well as our Republican leaders are much gratified by the short lived nature of panics in the stock market, as a result of this steady Re publican policy of the Treasury Depart ment. Judge Kelley of Pennsylvania wants Congress to adopt this resolution ; "Resolved; That the negotiation by the executive department of the government of a commercial treaty whereby the rates of duty to be imposed on foreign com modities entering the United States for consumption should be fixed, would be an infraction of the constitution and an invasion of one of the highest preroga tives of the House of Representatives." This is aimed at the proposed plan for a reciprocity treaty with Canada, against which there is a very bitter feeling among all classes since the Halifax award. The Democratic majority in Congress don't seem to be in any hurry to get to work. In fact, they are rather more timid than last year about even tbe ap propriation bills, evidently fearing that some rash brethren will propose some dangerous legislation in connection with them. It is clear that many of them have learned cowardice if not wisdom from the late elections. Logan. It is evident that the work of the present session of Congress will be pur sued with constant reference to the effect which it is likely to have on party pros pects in the Presidential campaign. Western Republicans in Washington al ready find matter for regret in the atti tude assumed by the President with regard to the retirement of the green, backs and the suspension of the coinage of silver dollars, and there are indica. tions that the let-alone policy finds favor with the majority of the party Repre sentatives in Congress. So far as affirm ative legislation is concerned, the session is, therefore, likely to be a barren one. Anything achieved in the direction of revenue, financial, or civil-service reform is likely to be due to the combined action of men of both parties who recognize some higher ideal of legislative action than that of waiting to take advantage of the other side. Since the first of January, the im ports of gold above the exports have reached $68,000,000. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives : The members of the 46th Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and grateful ac knowledgement to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the government directly affecting the business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on , the successful execution of the resumption act. At the time fixed, and in the manner con templated by law, United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equiva lent of coin. The demand upon the treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been com paratively small, and the voluntary de posit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The ex cess of the precious metals deposited or amount of United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000. . 

BUSINESS REVIVAL AND REFUNDING. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great re vival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with A m other nations in trade and production Ihe increasing foreign demand lor our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last, to November 15, to-the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and grati fying' improvement of the public credit The bonds of the government bearing only four per. cent, interest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all the national debt which was redeemable under present laws, The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt, since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177, The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which ma tures witnin less man two years is $795,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing G per cent, interest. It is believed that tnis part or tbe public debt can be re funded by the issue of 4 per cent hnnns. find Vit thrs rMnchnn nf interest which will thu3 be effected, about $11, 000.000 can be annually saved to the treasury. To secure this important re duction of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is re quired, which, it is hoped, will be pro vided by Congress during its present session. 

POLYGAMY. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citizens of the territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy demands the attention of every department of the government This territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a state, and the general interests of the nation, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the territory, require its advance from the territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privilege of a state This important change will not, howev er, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in very considera Die number upnold a practice wnicn is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than 17 years ago, but has remained until re cently a dead letter in the territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional guarantee of-relig ious freedom. . The supreme court of the United States has decided the law to be within the leislative power of Con gress, and binding as a rule of action for all who reside within the territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement It should be firmly and effectively execut ed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should be amended, and in aid of the purpose in view, I recom mend that more comprehensive and more searching methods tor preventing as well as punishing this crime be provid ed. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights of citizenship in the territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject. PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS. The elections .of the past year, though occupied only with state offices have not failed to elicit in the political dis cussions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and com plete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of national and state author ity, I find no reason to qualify the opin ion I expressed in my last annual mes sage, that no temporary or administra tive interests of government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will over ride all political prejudices and all sec tional and state attachments, in demand. ing that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the carry with them unj challenged security and respect, l ear- neatly appeal to the .intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other po litical subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of tbe right of suffrage. respectfully urge upon Congress to sup' ply any defects in these laws which ex' perience has shown and which it is with in its power to cooperation of the exe cutive and legislative authorities of the states in thi3 great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the com- the general diffusion of prosperity. civil service reform. -The President devotes a large space in his message to the civil service. He makes the occasion of presenting the re port of the Civil Service Commission the occasion for a full discussion of the sub ject. The President divides Ihe public service into two branches. One branch consists of those offioers elected by a people to carry out a given policy and their advisers. These should be expect ed to be in harmony with the party electing them, and will be expected to retire at the expiration of their terms of office. The others, embracing all officers who fill subordinate places, should be permitted to hold their positions and discharge their duties irrespective of partisan politics. The President devotes considerable space to the history of com petitive examinations since 1853, and calls attention to the good results which have attended the recent experiments in several branches of public service. The rresident denounces political assess ments as wrong, and, while not defin ing the extent to which Federal officers may engage in political action, says that it should not be permitted to an extent that will interfere with the proper dis charge of official duties, and should nev er be used as a means to entorce opin ions or coerce the political actions of others. foreign relations.

T". .... -. been made during the year in perfecting consular relations and making treaties designed to put us upon more neighbor ly relations with other Governments The President notes a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all American and European countries. 

DEPARTMENT REPORTS THE INDIANS The President informs Congress that it made no provision for the pay of Marshalls during the extra session, to the embarrasment of the public service The President repeats, without endors ing it, the recommendation of the Post master General of a law authorizing contracts with American-built steamers under the flag of the United States for transporting mails between this country and the ports of the West Indies and and South America at a fixed price per mile. The President warmly recom- j mends the passage of a law enabling the Government to give Indians a title in fee to such lands as may fall on them by lot, and also that the wants of Indians holding large reservations, after having portions of land set apart to them sev erally, may be provided from a fund created by the sale of their lands. This policy would open up large tracts of land for settlement now kept out of the market. The President gives his opin ion that the management of the Indian bereau should be retained in the Inter ior Department AGRICULTURE AND EDUCATION. My recommendations in former mes sages are renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of the department of agri culture. Agriculture is the leading in terest and the permanent industry of our people. It is to the abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly in debted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look for its continu ued maintenance to the same substan tial resource. There is no branch of in dustry in which labor, directed by sci entific knowledge, yields such increased production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public ser vice to which the encouragement of lib eral appropriations can be more appro priately extended. The omission to ren der such aid is not a wise economy : but on the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually that might be saved through well-directed ef forts by the government to promote this vital interest. The results already ac complished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the department of agriculture is an earnest of what may be expected with increased approportions for the several purposes in dicated in the report of the commissioner, with a view to placing the department upon a footing which will enable it to 1 prosecute more effectively the objects for which it Is established. Appropriations are needed for a more complete labra- tory, for the establishment of a veteri nary division, and a division of forestry, and for an increase of force. The re quirements for these and other purposes, indicated in the report of the commis sioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the department, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country cannot with propriety now undertake in the interests of agricul ture. It is gratifying to learn from the bu reau of education the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have been advanced dur ing the past year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to educatio'n, supplemental to local action in the states and territo ries, and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our government has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common school systems of the newer states, but laid the foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges of agri culture and the mechanic arts. Meas ures in accordance with this traditional policy for the benefit of all these inter ests, aijd the extension of the same advantages to every portion of the coun try, it is hoped, will receive your favo rable consideration. Rutherford B. Hates.
