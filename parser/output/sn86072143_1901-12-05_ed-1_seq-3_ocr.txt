S.-The president In his u.i 'Uul message to congress r., .s . The congress assembles this year tin. I der the s .nduw of a great calamity. I On the (Stli of September President Mo- Klnlcy was shot by an anarchist while attending th" Pan-American exposi tion nt Buffalo and died in that city on the 11 tii of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents lie Is the third who 1ms been murdered. nnd the bare recital of this fact Is Milllclent to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of tills, the third as HasslnatJon of an American president. have a peculiarly sinister slgnlllcance. I'.oth President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon In history, 'resident Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war and Presi dent Garlield to the revengeful vanity Df a disa po nted olliee seeker. Presi dent MeKinley was killed by an utter ly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular lib- erty if it Is guaranteed by even the most just nnd liberal laws and wtio nre as hostile to the upright expone of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical anil Irresponsible despot. Anarchy nml AmirchlntR, The pre elent continues with a eulogy ef Mr. MeKinley. then turns to tin. sublet of anarchy, denouncing Its doc'rlii' s and preachers. He says: learn -tl.. recommend to thecongress that in tin iwereiso of Its wise discre tion it s' o lid take into consideration the coming to tills country of anarch ists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justify ing the murder of those placed in au- thority. Such Individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify tlie murder of King Hum bert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of this country, and If found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came, and farreaclilng provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress. t A Subject For Fodrrnl Court. I The fideral courts should be given! jurisdiction over any man who kills i or attempts to kill the president or nny man who by the constitution or by law Is In bne of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be pro portioned to the enormity of the of fense against our Institutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole human race, and nil mankind should baud against the anarchist. Ills crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and thnt form of man stealing known as the slave trade. The president next considers busi ness conditions, which lie finds hltrhlv satisfactory. He continues: ' The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on v. It li ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth ecu tury brings us face to face at the be g niilng of the twentieth with very serious social problems. The old laws authorities to regulate, so far as was and the old customs which bad almost tui.n necessary, the comparatively in ttie binding force of law were once significant nnd strictly localized cor quite sullleient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously Increased the pro- ductive power of mankind they are no longer sutllcknt. Trnili Comlilnnl loni. The growth of cities has gone on be yond comparison faster than tho administration of the Interstate corn growth of the country, and the up- merce act. If, however, the judgment building of the great Industrial centers 0f (he congress Is that It lacks the con lias meant a startling Increase not stltutional power to pass such an act. merely m tne aggregate or wealth, uut in the number of very large Individual and especially of very large corporao fortunes, The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been duo to the tariff nor to any other govern mental action, hut to natural causes In the business world, operating in oth er countries as they operate in our own. The process has aroused much tin- nriTilm fi ernnt imt-t nf which I wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On tlio con trary, never before lias the average man, the wngeworker, tho farmer, the small trader been so well off as In this countrj and at the present time. Tliero Imvo been nhuiPH connected with tin. aceuniulatlnn of wealth, yet It remains .. .. . . . true that a fortune accumulated in .e,,i i.. mi ,mi. can ho accumulat ed by the pi rson specially benefited only on. condition of conferring im mense incidental benefits upon otli. era. Su eosful enterprise of the type which b iieHls all mankind onn only exist ii the conditions are such as to offer "Teat prizes as the rewards of Hiiccess. rtennrum For Caution. The president adds that there are m- jy i en ons for caution In dealing wi"i t jr" rations. He says; I he "ii'ie business conditions which hi e r ''i el the groin ii'.groj'utlons o ecav '-'to (rid Individual weallli have ni'i'l tliein very potent factors In International commercial competition. Moreover, It cannot too often he pointed ouv that to strllto with Ignorant .vlolenco at the Intercut:! of one set of men almost Inevitably endangers the Interests of nil. The fundamental rule In our national llfo tlio rule which tin, dorllcs nil others-Is th:it, on the whole mid In the Ions run, wo shnll t;o up or down together. The nieclmnlsin of modern business lit so delicate that extreme care must he taken not to Interfere with It In u spirit of rashness or Ignorance. In dealing with business Interrsts, for the government to undortnUe by crude and 111 considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad. would be to Incur the risk of such fnrroach Ins national disaster that It would lie profcnhlo to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the Impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nom inally at war. for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out In ra tional li'slilon what the wrongs really are amJ to what extent and In what manner It Is practicable to apply reme- dies. How to Correct tlic Ilrlln. Ap tt,s js ,ruCi nm v,,t t s also true thai there are real and grave evils. one of the chief being overcapitaliza tion been use of its many baleful coil sequences, and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct those evils. It Is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to re mit Mint when men receive from gov- crmm,n, (ll0 privilege of doing husl- mJ,s 1t!lll,r torpornte form, which frees lll(,m from individual responsibility nml vnnitM ,lum t0 can into their en- .,,rnriSes the canltal of the nubile, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property In which the capital is to bo Invested. Corporations engaged in In terstate commerce should be regulated If they nre found to exercise a license working to the public Injury, it should ,l0 as much lh(, .;)m of tlloso w,0 SCek for social Interment to rid the busi ness world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safe guarded by our Institutions, and It is therefore our right and our duty to sce tlm tlluv -01-k harmony with ti., institutions. P it 1 1 1 1-1 1 y (In- l'lrst Iscritlnl. The first essenti.il In determining how to deal with the great Industrial combinations Is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the Interest of the pub lie the government should have the right to Inspect and examine the work Ings of the great corporations engaged in Interstate business. Publicity Is the only sure remedy which we can now Invoke. What further remedies are needed In the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be de termined after publicity lias been ob tained by process of law and In the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full nnd com- plete knowledge which may bo made public to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations nnd joint stock or other associations. depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges should be subject to proper governmental super vision, nnd full and accurate informa tion as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable Intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized In one state, always do business In many states, often doing very little business In tho state where they are Iworpo- rated. There Is litter lack of uniform ity In the state laws about them, and, as no slate has any exclusive interest In or power over their acts. It has In practice proved impossible to get ade quate regulation through state action. Therefore, In the Interest of the whole people, the nation should, without in- , terferlng with the pjwer of the states In the matter Itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate busi ness. Amend Constltntlou If Kccrsinry. When the constitution was adopted, nt the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell tlio sweeping changes alike In Industrial am political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the nroner potato bodies of tlio day. The condl tions nre now wholly different, and wholly different notion is called for. 1 believe thnt a law can be framed w,cll w)11 vnnMl, tho natlon.,i govern ment to exercise control along tho lines above Indicated, profiting by the expe rience trained tin (nigh the passage and then a constitutional amendment should bo submitted to confer the power. There should be created a cabinet of- deer, to be known as secretary of commerce and Industries, as provided. In the bill Introduced at the last sec tion of the congress. It should bo his province to deal with commerce In Its broadest sense, including among many other things whatever concerns labor ?m, a11 """ "Acting tho great business corporations anil our mer chant marine. I.nlmr. The president declares that he re gards It necessary to re-enact the Chi tiese exclusion law. In regatd to labor '' J gu ei mucin, mioiiiu i Initio in Its contracts that all work i slum il Iiii ilnno iinilei- "tnlr" enmlmnnst should ho done under "fair" conditions and that all night work should bo for bidden for women and children hh we'l its excessive overtime. Ho continues: Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions nf wageworkers when managed with forethought and when they combine in slstoneo upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations them selves. Finally, there must also In many cases be action by the govern ment In order to safeguard the rights nnd Intel ests of all. 1'nder our eonstl. tutioti theie Is much more scope for ucli action by the state and the mimic, pallty than by the nation. Hut on di'ts ueh as those touched on above lie ni-thmal government can net. He asstrts that tho Immigration Inws nre unsatisfactory nnd flmt n lnw should be enacted to keep out not only nnarchlsts, hut persons of n low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation and those who are below n certain standard of economic fitness to enter our Industrial field as competitors with American labor. Thr TnrlfT nml Itcclproelty. The president declares that nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business Interests of the country by. any general tariff change at this time. . He adds: I Yet It Is not only possible, but oml- ' netitly desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a sup plementary system of reciprocal bene fit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity Is nil incident and re sult of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for In the present tariff law. Iteclpnu'lty must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty Is to see that tho protection grant ed by the tarltT In every case where It Is needed Is maintained, and that reci procity be sought for so far as It can safely be done without Injury to our home Industries. Just how far this Is must be determined according to the Individual case, remembering always thnt every application of our tariff pol icy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon tho cardinal fact that the duties must never ho reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wngeworker Is a prime considera tion of our entire policy of economic leglslntlon. ccil For Whirr Mnrkcta. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our Industrial well being nt home, tho principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support The phenomenal growth of car export trade emphasizes tho ur gency of tho need for wider markets nnd for a liberal policy In dealing with foreign nations. Whatever Is merely petty and vexatious In the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus pioducts In the long run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us Rome thing In. return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity. Wo have now reached the point In the development of our in terests where we are not only able to supply our own markets, but to pro duce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can util ize existing duties In any ense where they are no longer needed for the pur pose of protection, or In any cas where the article Is not produced hero and tho duty Is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask. Tlio cordial relations with other tui tions which are so desirable will nat urally be promoted by the course thus required by our own Interests. The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be In connec tion with those of our productions which no longer require all of the sup port once needed to establish them upon a sound basis and with those oth ers where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond tho reach of successful competition. I nsk the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before It by my predecessor. The Mn-chnnt .Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine Is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by tho con gress. It is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should he utterly Insignificant in com parison to that of other nations which we overtop In other forms of business. We should not longer submit to condi tions under which only a trilling por tion of our great commerce is carried In our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping interests, but it would also result In benefit to nil who are Interested In the permanent estab lishment of n wider market for Amer ican products and would provide an auxiliary force for the navy. Ships Work for their own countries Just ns railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping lines, if established to the principal countries with which wo have dealings, would lie of political as well as commercial benefit. From ev ery standpoint It Is unwise for the I'n Ited States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the 'distribution of our goods. It should bo made advantageous to carry American goods In American built ships. At present American shipping Is un der certain great disadvantages when put in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of tlio fast foreign steamships, at a speed of four teen knots or above, are subsidized, and all our ships, sailing vessels nnd steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow spied and malt carriers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost of building American ships Is greater than is tho case abroad; that tho wages paid American officers nnd sea men are very much higher than tlioso paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries, and that tho standard of living on our ships is far superior to the standard of living on tlio ships of our commercial rivals. Our government should tnko such action as will remedy these Inequalities. Tho American nieichant marine should bo restored to the onean. l'lniiiit'lnt. 1 Tho passage of the net establishing gold as the standard money has. It Is declared, been shown to lie timely and Judicious. The president adds; I In many resp"cts tlio national bank ing law furnishes sufficient liberty for tin. iimiui,- (ivufiilcit tlio ltnnlHni- function, but there seoms to be need of better safeguards against the de ranging Influence- of cuniinerclal crista and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should he made responsive to the demands of our domestic tnidn and commerce. Kconniny hi expenditures Is urged. Amendment of the Interstate commerce net Is advised, to Insure the cardinal provisions of that net. The work car ried on by the department of agricul ture Is ucirt considered and praised highly. The president then turns to forest preservation and Irrigation of nrld lands, saying thnt both ;ire highly necessary. He would put nil the work In connection with the forest reserves In charge of the bureau of forestry. Irrigation. The president continues by tracing tho connection between the forest re serves and the water supply. He says: The forests are natural reservoirs. Ily restraining the streams In flood nnd replenishing them In drought they make possible tho use of waters other wise wasted. They prevent the soli from washing nnd so protect the stor age reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation Is. therefore, mi essential condition of water conscr Tntlon. Tho forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the How. of streams mid to save the flood witters. Their construction lias boon conclu sively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can It be best accomplished by the Individual states acting nlonc. The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose Is to regulate the flow of streams, tho water should be turned freely into tho channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as tho natural How. The reclamation of the unsettled nrld public binds presents a different prob lem. Here It Is. not enough to regulate the flow of streams. Tlio object of the government Is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon 1 It. To accomplish thl3 object water must be brought within their teach, j Tho pioneer settlers on tho arid pub- ' lie domain chose their homes along strennis from which they could them selves divert the water to reclaim their holdings. Such opportunities are prac tically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of public land which can bo made available for homestead settle-1 ment. but only by reservoirs and biain ' line canals impracticable for private enterprise. These Irrigation works should bo built by the national govern- i ment. The lands reclaimed by them should be reserved by the government for actual settlers, and the cost of con struction should, so far as possible. l,o repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis tribution of the water, the division of tlie streams among irrigators, should bo left to the Fettlers themselves In conformity with state laws and with out Interference with those laws or with vested rights. The declaration Is made that In the nrld states tho only right to water which should bo recognized Is that of ' use. The president says that the doc trine 'of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing w rong. In-jiil.ir Problem. Insular questions are next treated. In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional Amer ican lines. Porto Ulco Is declared to be thriving as never uefore. The atten tion of congress is called to the need of legislation concerning the Island's pub lic lands. In Cuba It Is stated that much progress has been made toward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing, and It Is declared Unit independence will bo an accomplished fact. The president adds: Klsewhero I have discussed the ques tion of reciprocity. In the case of Cu ba, however, there nre weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why tlie policy should be held to have a peculiar application, nnd I most ear nestly ask your attention to tho wis dom, Indeed to the vital need, of pro viding for a substantial reduction In the tariff dtmes on Cuban Imports into tho United States. In dealing with tho Philippine peo ple wo must show both patience and Hrength, forbearance and steadfast res. olutlon. Our aim is high. Wo do not desire to do for the Islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for trop ic peoples by even the best foreign governments. Wo hope tWl for tliem what has never before been done for any people of the tropics to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nations. The only fear Is lest In our ovoranx lety we give them a degree of inde pendence for which they are unlit, thereby inviting reaction nnd disaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that in n given district tlie people can govern themselves self government has been given In thnt district. Tliero is net a locality fitted for self govern ment which has not received it. Hut It may well be that In certain enses it will havo to bo withdrawn because tho Inhabitants show themselves unlit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred. In other words, there Is not tlie slightest chance of our falling to fchow a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. Tho danger comes in the opposite direc tion. Trimbles Alipml Yet, There nre still troubles ahead In tlio Islands. The Insurrection has becoino nil affair of local banditti and maraud ers, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the old world. I'ncouragenieiit, direct or Indirect, to these Insurrcctos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hostile Indians In the days when wo still had Indian wars. The president declares that the tlmo has come for additional leglslntlon for tho Philippines. He says: It Is necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the re sources of the Islands can be developed, so that franchises (for limited terms of ; years) can lie granted to companies do lng business In them and every encour agement bo given to tlie Incoming of business men of every kind. It Is ur- ' gently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, milling, banking, currency, homesteads nnd the use and ownership of tlie lands nnd timber. These laws will give free play to Industrial enterprise, and the eoiiitnoi'cliil development which will sutoly follow will afford to the people of the l-.liiiidn the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.
