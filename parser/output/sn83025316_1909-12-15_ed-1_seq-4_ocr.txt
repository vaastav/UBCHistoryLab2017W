A FAMOUS HOTEL. We may now accept as complete the rehabilltation of Ban Francisco. To iltght will occur the formal opening of the reoonstructed Palace hotel. In all the Wost-perhaps in all the country there is no hotel more fnlnou than was the old Palace which fell before the destroying earthquake elements when San Franclsco was laid low. It was a landmark that was as well known Cs the Golden Gate itself. When its destruction was reported, there were thousands of people, the country over. who felt that they had sustained a per sonal loss. Now, upon the site of the old hostelry, has risen a new and greater palace, which is one of the largest and most magnlilicent hotels In the counyf. Ban Francico will now seem like San Francisco to its visiting friends. HONOR WELL SESTOWED. Today at the University of Illinois honor will be paid to the memory of Cyrus Hall McCormick. whose iinven tion of the harvesting machine not only revolutloniae agriculture. hut, as well. made possible the development of the "Oreat American Desert" into the gran ary of. the world. A portrait of the great Inventor will be unveiled in what is to become a hall of famne devoted to perpetuating the memory of men who uave rendered conspicuous rervice in the world of fannrming. MeCourmick was wisely chjea as the first of those to receive recognition. The time for placing the McCornuick portrait in the "Hall of arme" was up prroiately choser, as the present year marks the centennial of the birth of the celebrated Inventor. The life of Cyrus Hall McCormick was a career of plucky energy and of signal .ueess..l He was the som et a Virginia farmer who had himself spent a large part of an active life in his endeavor to make a machine to do the work of the sickle and ti:e enade but be had fai.ed. The son took the task as an inheritance. He sucmeeded not only in perfecting rhe vesper but in arrangement or the con Srractler and sale of the machines. BlHi eiastty for butsiness was not inferior to his ia'entive faculty. He built up at 4keo one of the greatest manu faetar9ag entabushments of the world.

One result of the publIeation of the mressage has been the renewal of confidence on the port of those who do t)e country's busine-s. The WaUl street view of the message it thus eXpressed by Henry Clews: "Neither the president's message nor the opening of congress created any dslturbance in the security markets. On the ountrary President Taft's views awere in many respects received with specalt satisfaction. The emphasis whicht he pl;ced ilon the necessity of pubtle economtr. .Ideration in regard to the use of the masimamn tariff and bis rational attitude regarding railroad and corporation problems show his de termination to catty out necessary re form movements with as little distur bence to business as possible. This is naturally reassuring. Congress as yet showns no signs of breaking out with antagonistic legislation, although It is quite apparent that the radicals were disappointed at the conservative tenor of President Taft's message. Politi cally speaking, the situation is hope ful, for while It is evident that large corporations must prepare themselves for more or less governmental reguais tion, and enforcement of the Sherman anti-trust law In its present drastic form may cause some disquiet, still the outlook in these directions is less threatening than auring the sometimes unwisely aggressive policy of the pre vious administration." 0 happiness! our being's end and Good, pleasure, ease, content! whate'er thy name; That something still which prompts the eternal sigh, For which we bear to live; or dare to die; How shall we win thee, kindly fate.

If theyl read the newspapers. .the members of the Taft family are de prived of the very pleasant sensation of surprise In connection with their Christmas presents. In Leopold's case, the evil that he did will live after him and there is mighty little good to be Interred with his bones. You make your hume. merchant's I Christmas happy by trading with himn and you help yourself at the sanm timte.

If there were more boosters the work would be easier; theres' a lot of it to be done. A sure way to make Christmas mer ry Is to lshop at home and shop early. The weather moan has added joy to the Christmans season for the buildern. Everyboody boosted: hence the sue ceam of the bridge and the celebration.

THEATERS Thle Iutte Miner has the following to say of William II. Crane, who ap p*'ars. In "Vather and tie Iltoys" in the Harnotls thttater ita this city tomorrow night: Htefore an audience that siaply re fused to give lhi: a rest, even between acts. .1liutjn i1. Crane, after an ab sence of several seasons, returned to a veritable triumph at the Broadway last night in "Father and the Buoys" one of the wittiest cotmedies George Ado ever wrote. Not only is Mr. Crane in his happlest nomonl in the character of "Father," but his suis.rting company is splendid and tile entire production moves along with a vim and life that is certainly enjoyable. :Mr. Crane is still the seine quaint comedian of former years and if he has aged any he does not indicate it. lie is splendidly fitted to this sort of a character or the character is fitted to hlitn. Just as one may regard it. As the old business man who has built up a fortune finds his sons growing away fromI him because of his refusal to get out and "ntax" it once in a .hlelv. to enjoy some of their amuse ments aith them: the sudden transi tion to the "gay o'd hay" of New York Is certainly startllng and uproariously funny. All this ;ives Mr. Crane an unlimited opportunity to display his particular talents and the result is de ightful. Father leads the boys a pace that leaves them "far behind the pro .ession." and finally they have to beg to be given a chance to catch UP. In eldentally. Mr. Crane unearths a few truths and does a la ely girl a good ttsra, but ths plece r = 41 y¶ froma the breeuesisist of goeq And it In aot iaa aa M a40 3i There is a lot of meat i this play said If .*A Ad es p be t wlldaW *I People Must Help Themselves IF STRUGGLE TO PREVENT SPREAD OF CONSUMPTION IS TO SE REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

The orel assays about 10 per cent and is the best body of ore found in the Rein deer at any time. The visit of F. Augustus Heinse to? the Sitewart property is believed to foreshadow the settlement of the con-1 test between the Stewart and ita neighbor. the Cocur d'Alene Develop ment company, and the resumption of work at the Stewart in the spring of 1900. The Stewjyrt built their mill on the Coeur d'Alene Development around under the agreement. it is un derstood, to purchase the two claimns on which the mill stood. Tihi agree ment the Stewart is alleged to have broken with the result that the De velopment people obtained an injunc tion which has kept the mill closed for many months. It is believed that the only settlement will be the purchase of the two claims by the Stewart.
