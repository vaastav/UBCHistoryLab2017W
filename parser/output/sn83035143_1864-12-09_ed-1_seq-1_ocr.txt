In the rebel Senate, on Friday, there a Eharp discussion on a resolution pro posing tbo appointing of a committee to memoiialize governors and legislatures of Stales, in reference to the exemption of able-bodied men for State purposes. It was generally conceded that more men were needed lor tne army, and it was necessary to know now many men bad been exempted. Several senators thought thai the appeal to t e Gov rio-s would more harm than good. .The resolution was referred to a committee. Nothing of any consequence was done military afl'airs. GOVERNOR BROWN'S MESSAGE. Tha Richmond Examiner of the 5tb, con tains a synopsis of Governor Brown's message to tbe Georgia Legislature. The message is most emphatic, and protests against the extraordinary recommends. tion cf the President to Congress to repeal tbe exemptions of all classes, and to give him discretion to detail such as he may thick proper. Governor Brown argues that to give tbe President such power would be to annihilate tha last vestige of Slate sovereignty, and totulvirt the great cousiiiuiionat Jiguu tu mo people. ii.e svs that when Congress, enacts such alaw converts i epublic&nism of the Confede rule St'.tcs in o the despotism of Tuikey, and it makes the President Dictator, and prostrr.tis the districts of the country, the independence of tbe press and the re ligious privileges of ihi poopie at his feet Eves the Lincoln Government, dospoticat it is, has not dared to attempt any such encroachment, upon the liberties cf the people f United States. 

REPAIRING.

Etawah iren works will also be re- established at once. DEVASTATION IN GEORGIA. A correspondent of tho Memphis Ap peal, writing from Atlanta on tbe 20th ul', describes the extent of destruction by the Yankee army. According to his statement, all the buildings cf importance to the reb els were destroyed. Tha formar inhabit ants are slowly returning. SHERBMAN. The Richmond Whig oi the Sin says, a telegram from Macon niys that the Yan kee force which had been operating in the vicinity of that city had been withdrawn, and the general indications are that Fher man will direct his coarse toward Dorian and Brunswick. U'ne auLwfcw n...i:i..i:n1.-i aajj Ah At Gen. Sherman with his artillery and in fantry went to Sanderville. His van ar rived there on Saturday the 26th, at noon, being on the road twodaysand a half from Milledgeville. At that rate it will take seven days to reach Millen, from Sander ville, and 17 days to reach fcavannan. From the best authority we learn that General Kilpatrick commanded the wing of the enemy which passed along the country road from Milledgeville to tha shoals of Ogeechee, where they eamped Friday night. They burned tbe gin-houses with a number of biles cf cotton. They turned no cribs or aweii. ing houses, and we have no reliable inform ation of the destruction of a single mill or factory in the country, though they passed several. They fook all the horses and mules in the country, whether hid or not, for they scoured all the swamps, and cap tured all the young negroes that were not run off. The enemy occupied Milledgeville from Sunday evening, 20tb, to Friday morning, 23tb. Their infantry and artillery made but little headway. They left Thursday morning, and General Ferguson's cavalry drove out the roar guard of cavalry Friday morning. The State House was not burr eJ, but much itutilated. The Penitentiary, Ar senal, Ac, were burned. The Magazine was blown up by tho rear guard as th"y left on Friday. The Richmond Sentinel in a long arti on Sherman's campaign says that in stead of that bold dash into the State which was expected to prove resistlets by its impetuosity, and to dispose of opposi tion bofore it could gather, we have cau tious reconnoissances,' timid feints and slow movements. There bas not been to aounh troublo to resist or avoid Sherman to find him. Ha left Atlanta CimiuW 15th. He evacuated Millidgeville on the 27th. He was supposed to ba at Garderville, having travelled a distance of one hundred and twenty-five miles in two week's time. Since leaving Atlanta he has not accom plished a single important object. His care and caution has proved a parent of danger, and has given us time to concen trate our means of resistance, and obstruct his path with obstacles. Sherman had no purpose whon ho start ed, nor has he now, of abandoning h's own department. It was not Sherman's object make his way to the Atlantic to assist Meade, leaving Thomas to his far iighf r honors and resposibilities in tho Wtst. If he shall succeed in penetrating the circle now surrounding him, and escaping to Port Boyal, his first aix;ty, liko ibat of Kilpatrick, will be for ships to take him away, steam to annnpoiis ana st jam to Nashville. If Nashvillo has not already fallen, he will be all too slow to quiet this importance and to mollify his chagrin. We do not share in the idea expressed by some, that Sborman's purpose was to make lodgment on the Atlantic to opcrnts with Grant. The Augusta Register of tho 30th says : Wheeler has been lighting the enemy's cavalry for 30 hours. Ha commenced fighting them in Jefferson county, and has been hammering them continually. Wheeler was in close pursu t of them when they entered Waynesboro, eo close, indeed, that he wts enabled to extinguish the fire bofore the town was much dam aged. The bridge over Brier Creek has been re-built, and trains will run through as usual to Waynesboro. General Wayne has occupied Millen The enemy have not crossed the Savan nah river. There bas been no enemy within twelve miles of the Georgia Central Railroad, and trains Will reeuma their schedule. The Richmond Sentinel of tbe 6th says : Information from official and other sources, seems to indicate that Sherman's objective point is Darion, near the mouth ol the Alabama river, fifty miles south of Savan nah. The Augusta Sentinel of the 1st, says that the City Marshal of Atlanta will start on his way homeward to-day.
