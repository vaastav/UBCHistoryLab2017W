In the name of democracy and for the sake of the democratic party in Tennessee, we beg the papers and people who are still pursuing those who differed them to halt. The party lash is larruped with a cruel, sharp twist and you crack it loud and seem to enjoy it. liut can the party poll a majority next time if you succeed in ramng out'' all those who do not choose to lick the bosses' b;ots? Look out over Tennessee and see the coun ties' votes falling off by the hun dreds. Williamson looses 600, Bed ford 500, Marshall 100, Maury 300, iiuirerloid 1200, Lincoln Coffee 200, Moore 200 and so on all over Tennessee. What does it mean? That the people are tired of such bosses and their insolence! That they preferred not to vote rather than have something cram med into them which the bosses called democracy! Right in the face of this and as if determined to force it further and make Tennes see a republican state, a rabid newspaper denounces 56 newspapers in Tennessee as "putrid anu .petty journals," "sordid," "subsidized," "corrupt," "traitorous," "infamous," "bonerbt ud." etc. 4 Now, say they are infamous and boucrht uo and that their accuser and villitier is the onlv pure and in corruptible paper in Tennessee,does it help the party any for that; paper to curse them out of it? Men, as sure as we live there is something wrong and rotten, somethipg repel lant that needs exoieising, in the party. These 56 newspapers are not unanimously of one opinion for nothing. There must be some rea son for it. but whether there is or not, the unmanly and UDjnst criti cism of their motives is the surest way to fasten them in their perver sity. As sure as 18S6 comes, unless this bitterness is left off and unlets better and more sensible men shape the policies of the party, Tennessee will stand in the repub lican column. This is no threat, for the writer has sworn in his wrath never to vote for a republican; but there are thousands of men who did pot live and sec the things he saw and felt in Lrownlow's life, and these younger men are learning to despise democracy for the littleness or its leaders. The Citizem by strenuous and un remitting endeavor persuaded Giles democrats that Savagery wasn t de mocracy and they came out and voted the ticket entire except the commission. Giles increased her vote for Bate because our people would not be driven from their par ty by an ignorant, partisan, pro scriptive newspaper at Nashville. There are hundreds of men who will not stand still and be spat upon and abused much longer. It we would preserve the party intact fo another victory, it is time even now to commence to quit the villification business. If you keep it up, the party is beaten. It is worse almost everywhere than in Giles. Men here are less intolerant and allow each the other his opinion. It has to ba that way all over the state before the danger is oyer. The last presidential message a republican will ever deliver is now fresh before the country a remark able document because of its ex treme moderation and common place expression. It represents thus the final dwindling away tp nothingness of the republican par t' and its policies, the gradual ooz ing away of its existence, leaving its failures the only prominent fca lures. The message emphasizes by its very insipidity several monu mental failures of the party that has controlled for a quarter century : Our sbipping interests in foreign hands. A bare modicum of foreign trade that naturally belongs to us. Our navy a tumbied-down wreck after millions on millions ate squandered on it. The tariff made a curse because of republican inability to adjust it properly and safely .handle and di minish the surplus. Stagnation of commerce and in dustry in exactly opposite ratio to our resources and unprecedented development and in spite of the most energetic endeavor. On these things are based all that belongs to the country's pros perity. The republican party leaves us the rotten wreck of a system. The country finds itself absolutely deprived of all means to render ef fective its energies or to profit by its -riches and resources, the victim of corrupt and infamous and igno rant legislation. Democracy must go back and mend the broken down places and gather up the wrecks be fore she can begin to build. The message is a final acknowledgement of republican failures. ti Modical- The Pulaski Academy of Medi cine met at Dr. Wilson s office Sat urday evening, Dec 29th, the presi dent, Dr. Wm.

His memory is already embalmed on the scat of the breeches of a nation of freemen. An aerolite about the size of teacup struck a farmer on theshoul der in South Kentucky, went through him and several feet into the ground. The beautiful unselfishness and adorable selfdenial of the editorial fraternity in Tennessee is manifest in the nearly absence of their names from the list of flesh-potters. The king can do no wrong. Vox povufi vox dei. The majority must rule. Whatever is is right, xnese are all reversed. A minority can di date calls the majority of the people traitors. Of the vice-pre9idency, the Chica go Times says: "Nothing that its incumbent can do or wish to do, or that its expectant can say or prog nosticatc, can attain the magnitude of an appreciable quantity." In other words, the vice-president is the insubstantial shadow of an augur hole through the vacant hoi low of a baseless vacuum. Secretary Lincoln refused to al low the Washington democrats to hire the Marine band to play at the Cleveland jollification, but permit ted them to play at Logan s recep tion. The little fellow thinks this government belongs to the republi cans. He may decide yet to en force his hereditary lien and take charee of the country himself. If he don't he can sell out his cheek a( a high price and retire into opulent obscurity. Just by way ot experiment merely to see how the old thing will work suppose, the democrats of Tennessee call a halt upon the matter of denouncing their equals. and, as they have triumphed in the late election, let by gones be by eones. and admit thai- a democrat who does not go it blind may be as honest and honorable and as good a democrat as the one who just huts his eyes and swallows the en lire wad.

President Arthur's message sent in Monday is an exceeding modest and well conceived stats paper. He congratulates the connt' upon the ease with which we avoided dif ficulty in the most exciting elec tion of modern times. "Nothing could more strikingly iliusti ate tho temper of the American citizen, his love of order and his'loyaliy to law. more signally dem onstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institutions." He ends the congratulatory paragraph wun a stroHg recommendation tor the passage of a better law to count the vote. He discusses in detail our foieign relations, showing that he has managed the intricate busi ness,with comprehensive statesman ship. We are on specially friend ly terms wHh all the world and our interests abroad have been well kept. He urges the stoppage ot silver dollar coinage. About $183- 000,000 have been coined and only aDout 4u,uuu,uuu are in circula tion. He recommends the aboli tion of all excise taxes except those relating to distilled snints. He urges some legislation that will be an incentive to American capital to invest in steamship building and that such vessels be subsidized ia effect by the most liberal compensa tion for conveying mails, etc. He urges the appropriation of o0,0UU,00U to be gradually ex pended in building defenses for our seaboard cities that will enable them to withstand an assault from an enemy armed with modern pro jectiles. The reduction of revenue by reason of the reduction in the postage rates has -been very 'small, demonstrating the wisdom of the reduction, lie urges that congress take absolute political control of Utah and polygamy suppressed by the most radical legislation consis tent with the constitution. He discusses our foreign trade with sagacity and at some length making various recommendations as to the policy that should be adop ted in placing it upon higher foot ing, He warmly commends the good results of the civil service rules, and recommends the re en actment of a bankrupt law. He recommends that congress Confer upon Gen. Grant a suitable pen sion, and thus gracefully says

The Banner's Pulaski writer thu gives away some ot our society se crets: Pulaski society is interested now in discussing two marriages which take place in Giles on Decembe 10th. Miss Florence Faust to Mr, Johu Buford of Franklin, and Miss Virginia Lee Bowers to Mr. Gray Hopkins. Miss Bowers is quite girl, having graduated from Martin College in June, 18S4. She is one of the heiresses of the conntt', own ing fine property in Elk river bot tom-land below Elkton, which place is her home. The marriage of Miss Faust to Mr. Buford is the consummation of an old feeling of attachment. Sev eral years ago u was understood that he was a "beau" of hers, but for some reason they did not marry. Mr. Buford married. His wile lived some years, and died leaving him two sons. Miss Faust, though wooed by numerous admirers, has remained consistently single. Mr, Buford renewed his attentions this fall, thereby reaching the "consum matjon devoutly to be wished." Diana. JVew is rather scarce among us now.

This lias been a lugubrious Thanks giving day for the republicans in Wash ington. Many have eaten their turkey with the Impression that it was the last tnat tney wouiu eat in tne apuai oi mu United States, ilany republicans sol emnized the occasion by getting drunk, as I know by experience 1 mean by personal observation. 1 saw them from my -window. President Arthur spent the day at Soldiers' Home, where he is dotting the i's and crossing the t's of his last mes sage to congress. The builder of Washington's monu ment celebrated the day by working on the summit of that dizzy pile. Sever by artificial means, except by balloon and steamboat explosions, have men at tained the elevation that these build ers enjoy. They have to avail them selves of every tine day in order to com plete the work by the 22 ol February, when the towering shaft wili be dedi cated in the presence of the governors of all the states and others prominent in official and in deplomatic liie, to say nothing of parades, tireworks, booming cannon from gun boats in the Potomac, trumpets and drums. Fast upon the dedication of the mon ument to the father of his cuunt.y, will follow the return ot the govern ment to the principles and the practices which made Washington's name and era memorable, a democratic president will be inaugurated on tiie fourth ol March. Thete is a world of meanin g, ot hope, of promise in tins comiug event that is already casting its sunshine before. Great crowds are expected in Wash ington this winter, and great prepara tion is afloat to entertain them. Presi dential inaugurations have always been the occasion of great parades and pa geants, but heretofore the voluntary military organizations have been almost exclusively from the northern and western states. At President Cleve land's inauguration it is expected that a number of military companies from the south will be present. This will furnish the patriotic editors of republi can journals an occasion to say that the rebels have at last captured Washing ton. But let sore headed bears howl. They will never learn that the war is over, but, alter having been beaten at the polls, and beaten in their conspira cy to make a second theft of the presi dency, they are no longer formidable. It is not thought that tho coming session of congress will be very inter esting from a legislative standpoint. Several appropriation bills have been already pretty well matured in commit tee. Some members of Congress who are now in the city go so far a3 to say that an effort will be more successful than was the previous one in this direc tion, 'lno prevailing opinion with members and senators here is that con gress will not do mpre than pass the regular appropriation bills. The new president will doubtless convene the senate in extra session to confirm his cabinet and such other ap pointments as require confirmation by the senate. Certain republican sena tors are disposed to throw every obsta cle in the way of Mr. Cleveland, and If it were in their power, would embarass his administration by refusing to ap prove his appointments,but the republi can majority in the senate is very small, and, there are eome liberal minded republicans who remember the lessons of acquiescence set by a democratic senate in confirming the appointments of the fraud Uayts. Among the hundreds of ready-made cabinets proffered without charge to the new president, it is observed that they all contain the name of Alleu U. Thuruian. One cabinet maker would have him to be secretary of state; an other, attorney-general ; a third wants him appointed secretary ol navy. The impression is general and deep seated that no democratic council table will be quite complete without the wisdom, learning, virtue, and judicial calmness of Thuruian. Political wise men and sages agree that the p. m. general will most proba bly come I row a southern state. lie will have the appointment ot more than 40,000 postmasters, but these ap pointments come more directly under the charge ol the first assistent p. m. general, manages all appointments tnat are not made immediately by the president S.
