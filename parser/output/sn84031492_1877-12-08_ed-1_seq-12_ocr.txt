The City Connell Committees nn Streets and Alleys, of the three dlrtelons, held an Important session yesterday afternoon, the principal business being the consideration of Aid.

There were present of tho several committees. Aid. Gilbert, Carey, Ballard, Daly, Sweeney. Tbroop, Beldler, Danmgartcn, Tarnow, and Wheeler. Aid. Ryan and Cnllcrton and several citizens. Interested In the matter, were present. Aid. Gilbert presided, and read a copy of ALD. CULLEHTON’fI AMENDMENT TO TUI FIRE ORDINANCE, which is as follows: Prrnw I. That flection t of an ordinance amend atory of Chao, ll of the Revised Ordinances, passed July so, l*74.entitled “Klre Department,” anu repeal ins an ordinance passed Nov. 24, inn. amending flee, .'iofsildcliapter.be, and the same Is hereby, amended so a* to resiT as follows: ••The firs limit* of the City of Cnlcago shall embrace ami Include within the same all of that district or terri tory which la now contained within (he corporate limit* of said City of Chicago, and no building shall be here after erected within said tiro limit*, imlcsa a permit for tho erection thereof shall have first been obtained (rom the flopertmendent of (inllill.igs of said city, provided frame or wooden buildings, sot over two stories In height, mav he erected within the following described territory: Commencing on Stewart avenue nt li* Junction with Egan avenue, thence north along the centreline of Stewart avenue In the centre lino of t wenty-ninth street, thence west on Twenty-ninth street to llalsted street, thence south on Daisied rlrretlo Thirty-first, thence weit on Thirty-first to Ashland avenue, thence north on Ashland avenue to Twelfth street, thence weatun Twctltn street to the city limits: provided, further, that the fee for Issuing such permit shall not exceed so cents. bar. 3. Thl* ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after Its passage and on publication. MR. FISHED, , aproperly-owncr within tho district described In tho above, appeared before tho Committee and spoke In favor of the proposed change. Ho said mat several property-holder* In tbe territory re ferred to felt as If ihcvhadnot been Justly dealt with by tho passage of tho last ordinance. Tho property In the southwestern section of tho city und been entirely unimproved since the passage of the Fire Ordinance. Previous to that lot* had been sold and dwellings constructed upon them. Now they found It Impossible lo gel the sewerage In that section sons to build of brick. Thogronml was so low that tbo water wns wltntn two nr three feet of the surface, so that brick or stone founda tions could not bo laid. The Council canid not give tho sewerage, and therefore they could not build brick bouses. Another hardship was that the taxes bad not been materially nimlnisbcd. They were paying taxes to Improve other portions of the ettv, and yet they had no imprnvomcnla out acre. He was paving taxes on properly that ha vi ould bo very glad to take two-thirds of tho as- Hossmcnts for. He had property there nnd proper ty down town which paid the same proportion of taxes. If they could get the privilege of construct ing wooden buildings of a stipulated height acres of such structures could easily and quickly bo torn down by the Flro Department. The water supply was also amply sufficient now to pre vent tho spread of fire. The lots could be sold If they had tho privilege of building. The editor of The Tiunuxz had argued that brick houses could be built as cheaply as frame. That wns not true. \ man with SffO could get a start by building a suamv, and finally obtain n good dwelling. To I ct brick be would have to have $350 at least to hla rt with. Aid. Gilbert said the ordinance provided for two story houses. .Mr. Fisher sold he would rather have tho height reduced than not have the ordinance passed atoll. Aid. Gilbert looked ovorihe document again, and said tbo ordinance read, ••Not to exceed two stories.” ALBERT CRANE, n real-estate dealer, addressed the Committee, lie said he had a largo pecuniary Interest In tho terri tory covered by tho amendment to the Fire Ordi nance. lie had lost twenty*threo buildings In the Great Plro, and ho did believe that a man who Imd thirty or forty acres of land, which perhaps ho had held for years, ought to have tho privilege of creeling tt least detached buildings upon It. Tho city was not burned twice by isolated small frame houses, but by largo wooden buildings that were hazardously occupied, lie owned property whero tho occupant could nut up small frame buildings, and tbs probability was that the terri tory would never need brick houses. to cited tho case of a Mr. Foster, who had udeavored to raise cabbages no a tract bind In the southwestern portion of tho cltv, amt 1 mild only obtain a cent uplcco for them, whereas he cnuld have rented tho property urafilubly if ho mold have built frame buildings upon it. Tho speaker owned twenty acres on Thirty-fifth street, for which ho gave S<iO,OUO live wars ago. 110 'Hide to realize anything on It. • Taxes had been levied and paid on It. and he asked the gentlemen to tell him what ho was going to dowTltilt. 110 spoku of Mr. ShurtlefTs Inability to rent a hrlck house lie had built on his property, and that ip'iitlcman had Informed him that ho bad no cn* • inirngunicnt to build more. The speaker dealt largely with poof people, mid bo. know how they n-oro situated. They were honest, hard-working men, who voted right every time. They made In* significant payments on the lots they Iwught of him. und ho knew their nerds. They could got umber on credit, and as many of them were car penters, or their friends or relatives were, they • uuld soon cruet a small dwelling that would an swer until they could obta'na butter one. Rut thuy could not get brick on eruitlt; the brick-man ulacturers did not care to sell them small quanti ties when they could come down town and sell large quantities to rich men. In tho outskirts of tho city they must build frame dwellings in order to have the Innd improved. It would not be of sneb great Im portance but for tho taxation, ilo had Just strug gled through paying hls.tnxrs. Ilu never know of Miy largo firo where small dwellings bad been tho cause of burning up a city,. Aid. Gilbert referred to the danger from sonth nest winds, and tho speaker sold he never knew of my such buildings as those desired selling fire to nelly, Acres of them could bo pulled down by the flremeu In a short time, and there was gen erally Insurance enough on them to enable the owners to rebuild. He had bad men come to blm and ask him to take hack tho lotvho had sold them, after they had partially paid fur them and iimnd themselves unsblo to build upon them. They were honest men, whoso hands were harden* * d by toll, and they were not Ilka some of tho arts* I'icratlc class whom he knew of. And they voted tight every lime. Aid. Duly asked the gentleman bow ho knew they voted right. ' Mr. crane said ho bad talked with many of them: luit bo would not discuss polldcol matters with the * unUcman. Till ALDinMEJf. Aid.

SAVED BY FEIGNING DEATH. o*rrt*poniHree Dearer (CW.) AVtcs. Thoro are on tho foothills in Gunnison County, at this season of the year, great numbers of deer and elk, with many mountain Hons and bear. William Yule and brother left Mr. Preston's ranch on the Gunnison a few days ago to hunt for deer Irad elk. A wagon drawn by two animals, guns, ammunition, and provisions completed Ihclr out fit. They traveled oil day and reached tho hills about nightfall and encamped. Seeing the next morning a good deal of signs of game, they con clndcd to remain at least one day, and try their luck. Early In tbo morning they started In differ ent directions with guns, powder, and ball, of conne. After going about five miles from camp and seeing no game, William Ynlo concluded to return. He .had proceeded but a short distance before bo heard, as ho' thought, the ruitllry? of tho dry loaves. Looking np, he saw, only about thirty yards from him, a huge bear coming directly to ward him, with open month, growling, and giving other evidences of a thirst for blood. Yule waited until the bruto came within a few paces of him, when ho took deliberate aim, bat unfortunately his gun missed fire. I Tho ferocious boast ran directly against the hunter, knocking him down, and as quick as thought Yule turned ovcronhls face and feigned to bo dead. Tho boar bit him severely in four places, disabling one arm and ono leg. After tho lapse of a fow minutes, neither feeling nor hearing tho beast, Yule cautiously raised bis head, and saw hla an tagonist about thirty yards off, apparently cover ing up something with grass. Seeing a tree near him, he made up his mind to reach It and get up it If possible, even though seriously wounded. So off he crawled through the snow, keeping an eye attentively on the bear and the tree. Reaching tho tree, he started to climb it, and tho bear started from bis retreat directly toward him, growling and gnashing his teeth. He soon reached the tree. Ynlo bad gone np only a few feet—Just high enough (or bis own safety, nut not too nigh for tho bottoms of his feet to be touched by the' nnso of tho beast. He again attempted to use bis gun, but In vain. Tho animal whined, growled, and gnawed at the tree. After a while he returned to what appeared to ben largo pile of grass, and commenced again to work as though be was con cealing something. Yule, though suffering much from cold and his wnnnds, resolved to ma'xo a last effort to save bis life. Ho descending cautiously to tho ground while tho bear was at work, ho crawled a few steps 111! begot a low, bushy tree between himself and tho bear, watching tho animal closely In tho meantime. He could not travel more than a hundred yards at a time without resting. At last bo reached the camp, completely exhausted, Tho next day Col. fashion, James Preston. P. T. Stevens, and JotmM. Smith armed themselves and went to tho scene of the fight, and when within about thirty-five or forty yards of a large f ile of straw, they saw a large bear emerge there rom and make toward them, evidently with tho Intention to fight, but he did not proceed far be fore ho fell, pierced with ten balls. He weighed* 800 pounds gross, and was neltbera grizzly nor a cinnamon, but a cross between tbe two, called sllvcr.llp or range bear, a malignant and ferocious beast. Covered up in .hts bed was found a largo dead doer, which It was supposed a mountain lion had killed and the boar bad stolen. ** 

COGNAC ♦» CONQUERED, /fun /hisefsco Mall. A trial took place yesterday afternoon at tho Rcconl Stables of the new electrleblt. * * Cognac," the man-oattng Porcboron stallion, bad the first benefit of tho Invention. Tho horse and hts vices hare heretofore boon described by the J/alf.as also tho numerous escapes of Prof. Taff, who Is at tempting to subdue tho brute. About 3 o’clock tho round tent In tho rear of tho stable, fitted up somewhat after the style of a circus, was well filled with spectators. The ring was boarded up some eight feet high, to prevent any of the visitors be coming food for tho horse, who roamed about bis den socking whom bo might devour, and one gen tleman, leaning over the rail. Cognac roared and went for bis arm In the atyle of a terrier for a rat, and almost succeeded In hauling blm over Into the ring. A rope having been attached to the animal’s halter oy the Professor through a partly opened door, It was passed around a post outside of tho arena. Tad then entered the inelosuro and fast ened another rope to tho nolo In the centra of tho tent. When the horse had been thus secured, he did not look particularly vicious, and submitted to have a brldlo headstall fastened on. with no other mani festations of dislike than shaking hla heademnbat- Icollv. This being accomplished, the Professor showed those present the hit and reins. Tho former Is of leather, leather holng a non-conductor, and a wire passing down each roln culls round the bit on both sides, leaving tho centra clear. The op erator carries tho battery in bis breast pocket.' Two wires from tho Instrument go down the alcoves of tho coot and terminate In tuo gloves, on each thumb of which Is a copper button to corre spond with thebuttanson the reins at the lermimw tiimof the wire. Therefore, when the copper on tno thumbs touches tho copper tin the reins, the connection Is made and the electric currant passes downono rein through the horse’s Jaw and up tho other. The bit being adjusted, several slight shucks were administered, which d.d not at all improve the animal’s temper. Thu rope fastened to the aide of the circle waa cast loose and held by an attendant, and Taff proceeded to lean the horso around the Inelosuro hy the relna. Cognac, how over, objected to bis first practical lesson In elec tricity, and made a lively fight fur about ten min utes, the rope on one side and tho reins on tho other preventing him from doing actual mischief, 110 resred sad sparred with bis forefeet snd meant business, tbo Professor finding It difficult to make tho connection snd apply the electric shock. Alter a liino ho succeeded, admin istering shock after shock, and driving tho hursa backward around the arena. When the animal was subdued, bo allowed himiclf tu be backed and led around, and oven permitted tbs attendant to touch hts head. The horse sweated considerably and ap pcarrd much quieter. The Professor slated that he considered the experiment a success, as never before had he been able to lead or back the animal, nor had his assistant gone in front of him and touched hts head. This may bo so, and Tad’s nerve and perseverance may be crowned with success, and the animal rendered moderately quid, built is very questionable! whether his bad qualities mar not bo transmuted to hts descendants to tho third and fourth generation, and whether be is really worth the trouble and risk of taming. He has al ready killed ono man, and, la the opinion of many, the nest way uf taming him would be to out a bul let through his brain. TUB SMUGGLED-CiGArt

LAOV FRANKLIN IN AMERICA. Wrfflnla Citg ( ,V/p.) Knteroriu. Ry the Eastern papers we see (hat Thomas M. Harry, second mate oftbe A. Houghton, a whaling hark that was lost while on a crulso In Hudson's Hay, has, after numerous adventures, reached New York, having In hts possession relies of Sir John Franklin, and knowledge of tbo whereabouts of a cairn supposed to contain the boogs and other valuable articles so tong searched for. This re minds ns that Lady Franklin paid a visit to this city In 1801. The fact Is probably unknown, however, to many Virginians, except those who were then residing In the city. Fho was accompanied by her niece, Miss Cray croft, and camo hero from Steamboat Springs, tak ing rooms at tho house of Charles L. Ros*. While here her ladyship visited and examined the mines of the Ophlr and Mexican Companies, then work ing in their first bonanzas, far west of where they are at present mining. During her stay here she was visited by many citizen*, ladles and gentle men, who were desirous of paying their respects lo her. During the evening of her stay a note was hand ed to her, asking. In very proocr terms, that the writer, a Mr. Hall, might bo permitted to present himself, ho having been much In the scrvlco of Sir James Ross and Sir John Franklin. Ho was in stantly admitted, and related many things that bad occurred In Anstralla, which served to enable Lady Franklin to connect him In matters in which herself and Sir John had borne prominent parts. This Interview was hardly ended before another excitement was caused by the presentation of C. J. Sullivan, now dead, but at that tlmo ono of our substantial citizens, and a most Ingenious me chanic and worker in Iron. Mr. Sullivan related to Lady Franklin tbo man ner In which ho had been connected with herself and hnshand, in a way at once so lerae and feeling as to bring tears to her eyes, causing quite a little sensation among those present. Sfany old resi dents will remember tho splendid Iron gale wronght by Mr. Sullivan at bis blacksmith shop on North U street, called tho •* Golden Gale ” and much ad mired by nil who were capable of Judging of such work. Mr. Sullivan, ll now came out, was armorer of tho ships Erebus and Terror, In tho Antarctic Ocean, while on n voyage of discovery lo the South Pole, leaving Lady Franklin and Sir John at Van Diemen's Land, of which colony Sir John was then Governor. On the return of tho ships to England Mr. Sullivan received n mes sage from Sir James Ross, at Woolwich, desiring him to Join tho expedition In tho capacity or armorer on the voyage which proved to be tho last ever made by the distinguished navigator nnd hts nnfortunate party. Mr. Sullivan did not go on ac count of tho strung opposition of hla friends ami relatives, therefore escaping all tho terrors, suffer ing*. and (ho sad fate of Sir John Franklin and hla entire command. The dignified and respectful manner In which these and many other circumstances were related by the old seamen, connected with the fact of her meeting with her old fellow-voyagers so unexpect edly In this far-away and wild point In her travels, no doubt produced an effect upon her ladyship's mind which earned her long to remember her visit to the Comstock Lode. CLEOPATRA’S COSTUME* A Vic Fork J/erald.

THE PRESIDENT'S MISTAKE. To (he Editor of TAs Tribune. Chicago, Dec. 7.—That tho South nnd North west aro thoroughly dissatisfied and dishearten ed with tho President’s financial policy, as ex pressed in that wonderful message, Is very ap parent on alt sides. I have not spoken to a man who haft not expressed himself thorough ly, determinedly opposed to that policy, wlflch, if carried out to the letter, will no doubt bank rupt every enterprising man in tho land. Is there no appeal from the President’s position) Cannot tho press and people keep up such a racket that our Congressmen and tho President will bo obliged to take cognizance? Is It possi ble that ono-tbtnl of the country—numbering among them all tho “goldltcs” of tho New England States and Now York, who ore clamor ing to be paid 16 or 20 per cent more than they loaned—snouid rule tho other two-thirds In a matter so unjust and one-sided? They got up •a delegation of Wall street speculators and eent them to tho President, presumptiously begging him to disregard the erv for help from two-thirds of the nation, and the President seems to have listened to them, and gratified their wishes as far as ho could. Is it nut übout time for the people of the Northwest and South to organize their delegation to wait upon tho President and Congress I Cannot tho people and the press throw such force and earnestness into this all-important matter that ho wilt be obliged to reverse his decision? Cannot there be such a noise made os to ralso a two thirds majority and pass the Blond Silver bill over the President's veto?—os It seems sure that he will veto such a bill If it is passed. Many people believe that It this policy of tbo Presi dent—which seems to have been put into Ids mouth by John Sherman and tho rest of his kind—ls persisted iu It will counteract all the' good feeling aroused among conservative people by Ids Southern and Clvll-Scrvlco policies; In fact, ids message Is humiliating to Ids friends, as it omitted many Important things, and on finance it showed ho did not understand the subject, and had not taken tho trouble to - post himself, but simply said what ho was told to say. lam a constant reader of your valuable paper, as I am of many others, and 1 have no ticed, by the careful and logical way you have of reasoning, you oltcn change public sentiment from wrong channels Into right ones, and If you will only keep up an incessant war upon this re sumption scheme, and continue to show up that swindling demonetization of tho M silver dollar,” you wilt do much good and gratify your patrons. Respectfully, J. F. COQDLT. JOHN SHERMAN. To the Editor of The Tribune. West Dkpzbb, Wls., Dec. o.—Noticing your editorial respecting tho President's financial policy, permit me to give, for tho benefit of the readers of TiibTriuunb, asolutlonof tho matter. Tho strength of tho opposition to the remonetiza tion of silver, In Mr. Hayes' mind, Is John Sher man. Tho weakness of Mr. Hayes’ financial pol icy is John Sherman. The aristocracy of debit is John Sherman. Tho powcrbebtnd the throne in finance In this Administration is John Sherman,, and tho reason is found In tho Sherman family publication that mentioned R. D. Hayes for President before tho Cincinnati Convention. It is useless to waste argument In the rase. John Sherman believes In the single standard of value, and he is too shrewd and too old a politician to bo thwarted, especially with tho prestige bo bos with this Administration. C.A.W.

As o whole, this message, so clear of pas sion or personal policy, so moderate In statement and argument, will be widely acceptable, and will tend largely to strengthen llio popular conlldence In tho honesty, integrity of purpose, and sincerity of the President. —Phdadtlphia Trttt Ultp.).

It will bo soon that Mr. Tlayea boa heark ened diligently unto tho specious pleadings of tbo resuwptionists, and that ho docs not yearn vio lently fur tho dollar of tho fathers.

In atyle, phraseology, and grammatical construction It is so decided an lm rrovementontbe worm-fence English of Grant, hat persons of literary taste wilt In some measure lm reconciled to Us author as tho usurper of tho Presidential office,— I/arrltburg Patriot (Dun.), There ia a look of posiUveuosa on subjects where It would be expected; yet, lake It through out. It will be regarded, with tho exception of tbo Houlhern policy part, ua sound In aeutiravnl, end plain and practical In tone. Even as regards the Southern policy, the general sentiments underlying It are correct.— JHUtburg Cmntntrclal UanUt (lito.). Tito President nsod a good many words to say very Uttlo. Except tho firm position he has taken on tho financial question, there Is Uttlo In his first message to impress the country with tho strength otitis convictions ,or his confidence in himself to euccossfully enforce tbo policy which he takes such pains to defend.—AVie York Vom* mtreial Aditrlittr (/fee.). Mr. Hayes stands by his colors in his message. Me defends tho Southern policy as based on popular demand, foreshadowed by his own pledges, and now vindicated by puollo opinion, and by Us qwn visible success, ills treat ment of tho financial question Is admirable. The other poluta of tho message are happily tame.— Upringfitld (J last,) Rrjuilleaa (/n<i,). Tbo President has given tho world another proof of firmness. Where many men'occupy the position he occupies, subject to similar Influences and trials, would vacillate, aud perhaps yield a point, we find that the mao occupying the highest position in tbs gift of the American people dis play# a degree of courage lo expressing bis con victions that must command tbs respect of the people.— l*Uttburg CKronUl* iUtp.), Tha reading of Presidential messages Is ofie of those eaadmfee which editors cannot avoid, and which none but editors can survive; sod we can confidently ssy that tualong aud sad experi ence we have never kuuwo a Presidential message ia Which so copious a flood of wotds submerged so •mall an amount of Ideas as In the utterances of the truly good H.

On one or two uuestlous it uigbt have been mure aggressive, particularly on that of Clvil-Bcrvicu reform, sluce the Administration has made eo much of It In other ways, but it cannot be denied that ou the whole frankness has been well tempered by prudence.— d'MladtlpMa Timts (/>«(/.). The Southern policy la treated with a cer tain ulry aud beaming cheerfulness that may or may nol be Intended to bide auapologoliu teuduucy of seutlinvot, but which Is certainly wide thu vehicle foraotuo fine writing la the 1770 vein, lie Is eminently correct, though, in the propoeltloo that the policy bos brought about a wry much im proved condition of things iu tbu Houlb. And fur this the Booth is eo grateful that the i'rewldeol has our full permission to make whatever excuses ha sees fit to bU party,—.Vim Orltant 'Punts iVem.). Tho first annual message of President Mayes Is calculated to produce a favorable Impres sion both el bout aud abroad,as well from Its gen eral tone and spirit as from tbs soundness and good sense of IU principal recommendations. It Is entirely free from the tone of sertlminllsm and partisanship which has characterized sumo recent message* to Congress. Ills equallr freo from any thing like egotism, and even where tho President allude* to the adverse rrltlcl*m which has been ps-sert upon his Southern policy Is without a Iraro of qnerulousness or personal feeling.— Baltimore Sun ( Ind .). Tho slmng point of President Hayes’ first message Is it* dear, hones L-manly (one on the re sumption nml sPvcr questions. Tho weak points are Its tamo and empty treatment of the f’lvll Service and Its complacent illusion* ns lodic South. The fair points are Its remaining direct and succinct summaries of public matter*. On the whole, ll I# a very creditable paper—not hold, striking, and commanding, but plain and sensible, written In good taste, marked by excellent temper, and calcnlated to leave ajucasant personal Impres sion.— Albany Etenlntf Journal Utep.). . Tho Republican party la pledged to ronin tain the public credit, and provide the people with a stable currency.

Let no man lag behind. Leave (o tho Democrats ail schemes for scmi-repndiatlon and a depreciated currency. Onrs Is the party of sound money and national honor.— Cleveland Herald Http.). The appeal on paper for the prompt pun ishment or any farther lawlessness has a thin ami far-off sound, and the Presidential assurance that ••whatever authority rests with mo lothls end I shall not hesitate to put forth ” partakes almost of tho nature of a Joke. If, upon tho formal requisi tion of tbe Governors of South Carolina and Louisi ana, no constitutional authority could bo found for retaining a mere handful of troops In these Elates, how, (hen, shall Federal force enter upon tho soli of a sovereign Slate without request from Its local authorities? Have tho Chisolm or tho Hamburg murderers come to Judgment? Nay, Is it not an open fact that tho prosecution of the lat ter was suspended with Administrative consent?-* Cincinnati Ttrnes {Hep.). Considered by itself, it is bo compact, calm, dignified, and scholarly: to Imbued with tbe spirit of I ho loftiest pitrlotismand cultured states manship, ns to make It ono of the strongest possi ble arguments In favor of Civil-Service reform. It is Impossible not to contrast It with messages transmitted to Congress by other Presidents, and, so contrasting it, not to see how 111-favored they are beside It. It demonstrates that Chll-Servlco reform has began in tho highest office of all, and that It Is to work down to tho lowest from a fit be ginning. While sometimes disagreeing with tho President In hla conclusions, we yet have nothing hut commendation for tnat which wc feel to be the ablest message transmitted to Congress since tho term of Abraham Lincoln.— Philadelphia Inquirer I Hep .). Tho message of President Hayes is im portant for nothing but for Us expressions npon tho financial questions, and those utterances have been already anticipated. That ho will veto any bill providing for free coinage of silver and for lu nulimlted tender, 1* evident. Tbo veto will lead to more important results than unr Presidential act since Lincoln slgucd the Emancipation Procla mation. It wilt arouse a deep Indignation, which will grow and widen as men discuss it. audit will cause a new organization of political forces. It will have tho effect of the firing on Sumter: It will awaken tho spirit of tho people. Wo thank Presi dent Hares for his message, and wo shall thank him for his veto. He Isa powerful Instrument in a great cause,—such an instrument as George 111. was in establishing tbe American Rcputillo, or os Joffctson Davis was in emancipating Slavery.— Terr*Haute Exprttt Und,). When Sir. Boutwell, who was Secretary of the Treasury, was dropped from (lie Senate, be was appointed at ss,oi}() a year to revise the Re* vised Statutes of (ho United Slates. We suppose this to hara been done under the Civil-Service rules, because ho wasn't a lawyer. There could bo no position bettor calculated to Inject Into tho laws curtain phrases and sections for tho convenience of tho schemers who havu special Interests in our legislation. Mr. Uontwcll Is onoof the persons who were engaged in tho trickery of demonetizing silver. The great omission of the gold-sharps was in nut Including in tho Revised Statutes or 1874 the Refunding act of July 14,1871). If they had dono so. tho "coin of standard value of tho present date" would hare referred to a time subse quent to iho abstraction from the people of the silvcropttun,—that Is, to thcTdaio or tho adoption of the Revised Statutes. In that case, tho face of tho bond would have been changed to corre spond, and the bonds Issued under the Re funding act—tho 4 per cents, for Instance—would have been gold bonds. Mr. lloutwcll may enter tain the high purpose of completing his work as Secretary of the Treasury In throwing the Refund ing act Into tho next volntno of Revised Statutes, with the usual repealing clause of all conflicting legislation. This would make tho bonds thereafter Issued gold bonds, lawfully and inevitably, at once and always. Will tho great American statesmen wbo aro interested in tho rights of the people—that dragon of financial vlrtno, Mr. Uarflcld, for In stance—see that there Is no more surreptitious American legislation In the interest of tho British gold policy! Don't let this change of bond-contract bo accomplished through tho careless acceptance ofassurances that there la nothing now that Is im portant In tho revisions.

EXAMINING ARCHITECTS WANT TO BE PAID. To (As .Editor a/ The Tribune. CntcAao, Doc. o.—Two years ago last Jane tho Common Council directed the Maror, byaonanl muus vote, to employ seven of the oldest and most distinguished architects of this city to examine the new Custom-Housebuilding, to ascertain whether It was the worthless and nnsafe thing which Ur. Superintending-Architect Potter and tho Washing* ton Commission bsd declared It to be. They had said Its foundation waa nnsafe, and that It must be palled down. The people of this city were not satisfied with (heir verdict, and de manded that the case should bo carried to a higher court oMneulry, composed of our own beat archi tects, who were familiar with the soil of Chicago, and were competent Judges in regard to the aocurlty of the foundations of the great build ing. Tub Tribune, as the exponent of pnbllo opinion, and some other papers, iterated and reit erated the demand, until tho Mayor, at tho request of the Council, appointed Messrs. Van Osdel, Uoylngton, Whecloclc, Uaaer, Hurling, Egan,and Chesbrougb to do tho work and report to that body. Tliovcompllea and mado a roost exhaustive and scientific Inquiry Into all the matters which af fected the safety and permanency of tho structure, and reported that tbu soil, foundations, walls, ma terials, etc., which had been condemned were right and safe, and that, with some slight modifications which they suggested, tne edifice could be complet ed. The Council accepted tho report, transmitted It to Washington, and Secretary Urialow appointed another Commission, which came, examined, availed themselves of tho laborious Investigations of the Chicago architects, and reported to the Secretary in favor of the security of the founda tions, the character of the stone, tho solidity and safety of tha walls, and of the completion of the building. In short, after four days' examination, for which tho United Slates Government paid them tu.coo, they confirmed the Judgment of tho Chica go architects, based upon the work of nearly four weoki. Messrs. Van Osdel ami Daaer went to Cincinnati and Uuvna Vista, at their own expense, and made a thorough investigation Into tho quality of the atone of those quarries and of the buildings erected of the Duona Vista stone In Cincinnati. Tor this arduous work ■nd this exhaustive and painstaking examination, Indicated In thulrelaborate report six of those gen tlemen—Ur. Chesbrougb, being In the city's serv ice.excepted—rendered tbolr bills, which amount ed In all to 53,4U0.—1.e.,4200 less than tho United Slates Government paid three men for four days' work. This bill the Common Council declines to pay, advised by the Law Ddpartmout that it has no legal right to do ao. They should have thought of that before they ordered the work done. It comes with a bad grace from tho representatives of a great city to employ seven of tho finest experts In the city to do tbclr work, and then lull them they bavo uo authority to pay the bill, Thutthu city ought to pay these gentlemen for tbolr services and expenses, however, suouis plain from tho following considerations: The city, through Us Council, has a right to protect Itself against dangers to Its citizens threatened by build ings built ou Insecure foundations, with Imperfect material aud cracking walls. If to adord such pro tection Is not a "municipal purpose," for which the Council has a right to Impose aud collect taxes, why do they assume this power, and why have they crusteduu Executive Department, with a Su perintendent of Buildings and a stall of tun sub ordinates, whose right end duty are to supervise all the buildings which are erected In the city, end to pull down, if tho owner will not when ordered, any building which puts in peril the citizens of Chicago? Here was an Immense structure being erected by the Government of the United Stales, which the Supervising Architect and a Commission of throe Government experts had pronounced un safe on Its foundations,—resting ou **a bed of mud," constructed (of Imperfect soft stone, with walls already dangerously cracked, end so worth less that It must bo pulled down. . This waa prims facie evidence of (lie dangerous character of this great building, which Justifldd the Council in in stituting an Inquiry. Tha Mayor had nut yet an- Eolnted tbo bupcrlntendeut of Uuildlugs, and, ad be been appointed, be would not have been coniputcut to decide a question of such magnitude as this, which Involved scientific skill of tne highest order, and a combination of wisdom and experience which could nut be found In a De partment tbo bead of which was expected to de vote bis whole lime to it at a salary of gt!, 000 per annum. But the Council bod the same right to create a special Commission for su Important In vestigation which it had to create s Department, and, uavlng created it, they have no moral or legal right to refuse to pay such Commission, any more than to repudiate the payment of the salaries of the superintendent of Jiuildlngs sod bis subordinates. But it Is said this le a building of the United States Government, built 1 on its Uads.of which Congress has exclusive Juris diction, and therefore tho City of Chicago had uo right to interfere with U. It is the right of Chi cago to protect Its citizens against auuauceia tbo shape of au unsafe structure, and the city Is as competent to do this In case of a violation of its building lave by tbs United Butos Government as iu suy other case. The Government of the United blUts could not store gunpowder la great quanti ties, or ultro-giycertne, on Custom-House Square; nor could it maintain a uulsance In tho form of a great building built on tnnd foundation*. wllh cracked wall*.
