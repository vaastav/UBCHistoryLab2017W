I tbwt it \\ ill also bo successful li the Sonate. There appeared to a strong doniand for the reji il": this much abused law. Perhaps we may get along better without it, but we confess our inability lo soo exactly what tho majority ol of thc farmers will do for supplh s. The people are not lu a condition to pay cash, and indeed, lids ? not practicable in any agricultural di triet; yet they must work for months before they receive pa A for their labor. Now tho tpiestion is, bow shall they live during Ibis time. Wo believe timi when Un laborer eau no long? r ? led bis labor, an Increase of chat tel mortgage? and mortgtij. of real estate will bo the result. M< r chants will not advance supplio without some security, andan aminatiou of the ofllees will show that thc growing tendency i give mortgages on stock ami html in addition t<< tho lien on the crops, A great many farmers baveagn al ?leal of land and rn? money. Tli rent this land for a certain amoti il of cotton. The renter gives n i i ^ n on the crop for supplies. New, if he could mit do this, tito landlord must either advance them himself and If he is (as most men are nov - inlays), unable to do this, bc mi: ! give the land as security. Suecos sive bati crop year- conic und thc merchant wants bis money and tho land ls sacrificed. This is our view if tho matter and wc d<> not believe that thc people desire that tho lion law should K?> without a substitute, at least. It is abused, we admit, but could it not be amended. Emigration Agents. For the past few years it seems that our County hus particularly suffered at the bauds of Emigration Agents. That,th? se agents usedls honcst moan-: to induce people to follow them; that they make mis representations and promts it is impossible to ?ullin, aro fach well known in Ibis community. Not only this, hut they have caused laborers to desert their crop " they most needed attention, ?nd caused a great deal of ineonvi ii? ience and worry to tho farmer Yet when the legislature seeks lo protect the people by requiring a heavy license from these agents, we hOar one man deel ;:.<. i! ;- "nu Anierleaj" another calls upon free traders to oppose tho bill hccui I is a "protective" measure.

But our Son ators think differently, and cense qtiently have killed Mr. Wharton's bill. His Message to Congress,, The President's Message lia?
