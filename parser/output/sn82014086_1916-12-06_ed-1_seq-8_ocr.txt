Doctor Says Nuxated Iron Will Increase Strength of Delicate I People 200 Jn Ten Days (a many Instance .Persona have Buf fered natnld asonr toT yar aoctor Ina for- nervous weattnesa. atomara, liver or kidnry dliwnse r some other albnoat wliea their real trouble wa laek ot Iron la the blood How to tell. New Tort N. T. -In recent- dis course Dr. JS. Sauer, a specialist who has studied wtrlely both in this country and Europe, said: It you were to make an actual blood test on all poeple who are ill you woald probably be greatly astonished at the , exceedingly Jarge number who lack Iron and who are 111 for no other reason than the lack of iron. The moment iron is supplied all their multitude of dangerous symptoms disappear. Without iron the blcod at once loses the power to change food Into living tissue and therefore noth ing you eat does you any good; you don't get the strength out of it. Tout food merely passes through your sys tem like com through a mill with the rollers so wide apart that the mill can't grind. As a result of this continuous blood and nerve starvation, people be come generally weakened, nervous and; all run down ajid frequently develop all sorts of condltlans. One la too thin; another is burdened with un healthy fat; some are eo weak they can haTdly walk; some think they have dvspepela, kidney or liver trouble; pome can t sleep at night; others ace sleepy and tired all day; some fussy and irritable; som.i skinny and blood less, but al! lack physical power and endurance. In such enses it is worse than foolishness to take stimulating medicines or narcotic druss, which only whip up your fagging vital powers for the moment, maybe at the expense of your life later on. No matter ' what anyone tolls you, if you aro not r.trong and well you owe it to yourself to make the following test. &ee how long QUIET DAY WAS OBSERVED IN NORWICH Bishop Brewster Delivered Sermon at Trinity : Episcopal Church, -.I ii.

Next take two five-grain tablets of ordinary nuxated Iron thiree.' times per day after meals for two weeka t Then teat your strength again and see for yourself how much you have gained. I have seen dozens of nervous, run-down peopTe who were ailing .' all 'thesuime. double and ven triple their strength and endurance and entirely get rid of their symptoms of dyspepsia, liver and other troubles In from ten to fourteen days' time simply by taking iron In the proper form, and this after they had In some cases been doctoring for months with out obtaining any benefit. You can talk as you ploaae about all the won ders wrought by new remedies, ; but when you come down to hard facts there Is nothirig like good old Iron to put color In your cheeks and good sound, healthy flesh on your bones. It is . also a great nerve and stomach strengthener and the best blood builder In the world. The only trouble was that the old forms of inorganio iron like tincture of Iron, iron acetate, etc., often ruined people's teeth, upset their stomachs and were not assimilated and for these reasons they frequently did more harm than good. But with the dlsobvery of the newer forms of organ ic Iron all this has ' been overcome. Nuxated Iron, for example, is pleasant to take," does not injure the teth and Is almost immediately beneficial. : ' i-' . -: -' NOTE The manufacturer of Nuxsted Iron have such unbounded onfldfooe la Its potency that they authorise the announcement that they will for- frit WOO. 00 to any Charitable InsUulion if they cannot take any man or woman under sixty who lacks Iron and increase their strength 200 per cent, or over in four weeks time, provided they have no serious organic trouote.

RECOMMENDATIONS Submitted at Joint Session of Congress in Message . - .... ;f Read by President Wilson Himself J. DEALT MMOST ENTIRELY Urge immediate Provision for the Enlargement of the Inter state Commerce Commission; the Establishment pf ar Eight Hour Day for Trainmen Operating Trains in Inter state Transportation; Legislation Providing . for Arbi tration and Investigation of Labor Controversies; Limit ing the. Expenditure of Money in Elections; - Providing ' , for Promotion of Vocational and Industrial Education. : Washington, Dec.' 6 President Wil son read his message before --. joint session of congress in the chamber of the house1 at noon today. Its' text follows: Text , of Message. - Gentlemen of the Congress: ' 't In fulfilling at ..this time vlie duty laid upon me"1 by the'Constitutlon of communicating to. you from time' to time information of the state pf the Union and recommending to your con sideration such legislative measures as may be judged necessary and expedi ent I shall continue' the practice, which I hope hair beSn accejitstrjle to you, of leaving to the 'reports" of5 the several heads of the executive departments the elaborations the, detailed needs of the public service and' confine myself . to those matters of moro general pub lic policy with which it seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the present session of the Congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily; act! at this session and shall make ray sug gestions as few as possible: but tfiere were some things left undone at the last, session which there will how be time : to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the pub lic to do at once. . : Early Actiorl Necessary: In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earnest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the programme of settle ment and' regulation which I hp.d oc casion to '. recommend to you .it the close of- four's last session in -clew of the public daggers disclosed bjf the unaccommodated difficulties ihich then existed. a'id vluch still unhappi ly continue to exist, between the rail roads, of the country and their loco motive engineers,, conductors, and trainmen;,.. . ; liriteratate Commerce . . 7 I then recomraend-ed: First, immediate pi-ovision ftrV the enlargement artjd iiifiiTinistrative reor ganization of the .Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines embodied in the Mil recently passed by the House of- Representatives and now awaiting- action by the Senate; in or der that th Commission may be en abled to fj-e-aj withsthe many great and various - dwes no devolving i(nr.; U with a pftfnaptnerfisS and tnorougfrness which are; with its prfseii't constitu tion and means of action, practically impossible. w Eight Hour Day Second, the es.a!lisr,ment of an eight-hour-day. as the-legafc basis alike of work and f-W-asrey 'ly.-Hw. employ ment of aHiv'-railway employee s yiSvho are actually . hgage.d in the wcfK of operating trains in interstate tfuns-J portation. - Third, the? juthoriTction of theiap pointment by '.the President of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in expriencs of the adoption of the eight-hovti'ay in railv.av tutms portation allk'f$r the men and fofrthe railroads. " -i? Freight Rates ; Fourth, .expiicit npproval by the Congress of - the consideration by the Interstate Commerce Commission of an increase 6f freight-rates to meet such additional expenditures by-, the railroads as 'may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight hour day and - which hOTtr hot been offset by administration 'fead.fus-cments and economics. . should the . facts dis closed justify the increase. Arbitration of Controversies Fifth, an cmendment of tUe existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, ; conciliation,, . and arbitra tion of sucn controversies as the pres ent by adding to it a provision that, in case the moJhodH of aecommodation now provided .for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lock out may lawfully ' he ;attempted. Extension of Executive Power. And, sixth,-, the lodgement In the nands of the Executive of the rower, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try as may ba required for. military ue and to operate them for military purposes, with' authority ti draft into the military service of . the - United4 States mioh tram ' crews and admin istrative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and effiicenCUse.-j Power of I. C. C. Clear. -. The second and third of . these rec ommendations the Congress tmmedi-' lately acted on:: it established the eight-hour day as the v legal , basis of work and wages in tram service-and it authorized the appointment of com mission , to observe and -report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed; but it postponed action upon the oth er suggestions. ; until, an opportunity should be offered for a. more "deliber ate consideration, of them. The - fourth recommendation -- I do- not deem it necessary to renew. The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase- ot -rates on the ground referred to is ' indisputably clear and a recommendation by the Congress with regard to . such va mat ter might seem to draw." in question the scope of the Commission's author ity or its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt-either. - The other, suggestions 'the Increase in the Interstate Commerce -Commission's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial -disputes, and the grant to the Executive of the power to control and operate the rail way when necessary in time of war or other like public' necessity; I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation is manifest and ' pressing. Those , who have entrusted us with the responsi bility and duty of" serving and safe guarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse-a fail ure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of ac tion upon them. - -,- - - Not only does the Interstate 'Com merce Commission .now. find it prac tically impossible, with its present j BY 

PRESIDENT f -" : IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS membership and organization, ,to per form Its great functions promptly and thoroughly but - it is not unlikely that it may presently "-be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It, must first be perfected as an administrative instru ment. - ' - ' : Industrial . Disturbances The country cannot and should, not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the Con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that' there must be no doubt as to the power of the Exec utive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the .railroads tor the concentration of the military ' forces of the nation wherever they are need ed and whenever they .are needed. Program of Prevention This is a programme of regulation, prevention, rind administrative effici ency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the efficiency of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the House of Representa tives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the Sen ate. . Rights of Workmen . I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the Congress -would hesi tate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any roan in any occu pation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he desired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the - individual workman to leave his work before re jceiving the approval of society in 'do ing so would be to adppt a new prin ciple into our Jurisprudence which I take it for gi anted we are ' jiot pre pared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or in terrupted by the . concerted action of organized todies of men until a public investigation shall have' been insti tuted which shall make the - whole question at issue plain for the. judg ment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose, any such principle. It is based upon the very different prin ciple that the concei ted action of pow erful bodies of men shall not r.e per- I rait!ed to stop the -iftdnstriaj, ivoooses. of the nation, at any rate befrae the. nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and em ployer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to .consider all practi cable means of Conciliation or arbitra tion. 1 can t:ee nothing in that pro position but "the justifiable safeguard ing by society of the necessary pro cess of its very life. There' is rv.h ing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitnrily and unjustly done- It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the ,'nterests and liberties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of; so ciety itsejf. - . Matters Awaiting Action of Senate Three matters of capital import ance await the action of the Senate which have already been acted upon by the-House of Representatives;, the bill, which seeks to extend greater free dom of combination to those engaged In promoting the foreign commerce of the country . than is now thought by some to be legal under the torms of the laws against monopoly: the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico; and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic regu lation of the expenditures of money in .elections, commonly called the Cor rupt Practices Act., I , need not labor my advice that . these measures be en acted into law. Their urgency iles. in the manifest circumstances which ren der their adoption at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would seriously jeopardize -the interests of the country and of the government. - Expenditure of Money in Election. " Immediate passage of . the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; because at least two years will elaps.e before another election in which Jcd- eral offices are-to- be filled: but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent -observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present experi ence: and a delay -would have the further very serious- disadvantage of postponing action until another elec tion was .at hand and some special ob ject -connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of, those who urged it. Action . can be ' taken now with facts for guidance - and -vithopt suspicion Of partisan purpesa. Our Export Trade I shall not argue at' length the de sirability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and' concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise ut building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will : immediately, assume, has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution: It is deem ed, to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an -adequate scale under, our : present laws. . We should clear away all legal obstacles and cre ate a basis of undoubted law for it which 'Will give freedom -without per mitting unregulated . license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape ue if -we hesitate or delay. ' ' Organio Law of Porto Rico ..' The argument ... for . .tho proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the . Is land and regulating the rights ; and privileges of its people are not just. We have created -expectations of . ex tended - privilege which we have no satisfied. There is. uneasiness amoni the people of the Island and even t -rhe
