Dee, s.— The jig is up and nothing is left but good roads be- tween here and Minnesota. Chicago got the convention and there is a sound of lamentation at the headquarters of the Argonauts at the Arlington. Tim Byrnes keeps lonely vigil there, looking with a sorrow that knows no surcease at the emblems of the greatness id' Minneapo- lis, once the pride of the hotel, but now the gibe of every passing stranger. The rooms arc deserted and haunted only by the stale fragrance of the free cigar-; which accomplished nothing. The mem- bers of the committee consumed them and drank our Old (row, only to vote for Chicago in a corner of the Ebbitt office. Col. I'liiiunier moralizes on the evanescence of human hopes, the raven mustache of Gov. McGill no longer floats over Pennsylvania avenue like the oritlaiiime of Xavarra. and the bald head of .Senator Windom is polished with the energy of despair. The dele- gat ion of Argonauts is scattered through- out the city seeking oblivion from sor- row in the many attractionsof Babylon. Jason did not gel the golden fleece and Medea wonders about with disheveled hair. It is too, too bad. The Argonauts crowded the Union League building to- day and while the committee sat behind the closed doors, they were 1 I.I -III I> with HOPE. The first ballot guv's Minneapolis six votes, and they smiled in a sickly way. The second cave them eight and they cheered. The third gave Chicago the convention and hope died. They asked nothing more and will go home in misery. This all chanced, too, with Freeman l.ane in the committee. He got in on a proxy from Montana and swore to do a freeman's duty. When if was announced that Minnesota should open the ball and Dakota .-lose it the Argonauts were jubilant. Wei I. Senator S\ iudoiii opened the ball, and Chicago, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Omaha and other villages stood aghast before his glowing word picture of Northwestern greatness. It, was a magnificent effort. The other cities chipped in and sang their little song in turn until Dakota was reached. Gov. Mellette took the floor and made 'the hall ring with the praises of Minneapolis. I!v special permission Col. l'luinuier was per- mitted 1.. add a word, and for fifteen minutes the applause and laughter shook the statue of Gen. Thomas out- side. Hut it was no use. The wiles of those Chicago wire pullers blinded the eyes of the committee. and they went down to destruction. With willful deliberation the committee followed the lead of Steve Elkins and selected the wicked city of Chicago. The wail that followed ruffled the calm waters of the Potomac, but the committee went to a reception at the league rooms to-night. as blandly as though it had done a good thing. The Argonauts are making the best of it. but. of course, they will walk home. They are now studying maps to find a route to Minnesota that does not go by the way of Chicago. IIki.ot. HOAX IT WAS DOSE. Details of I lie I-'ight for tlie Loca- tion. Washington, Dec, 8.— The Republi- can tional committee was called to order at 11 o'clock this morning in Room 150 of the Arlington hotel, by B. F. Jones, of Pennsylvania, its chairman, .•Samuel Fessenden, of Connecticut, act- ing as secretary. In a brief speech Chairman Jones stated the object of the meeting, as follows: Gentlemen of the Committee As stated in the call, this meeting Is for the purpose of selecting a time and place for holding the next Republican national convention, also to consider such other matters as may properly be brought be- fore it. As everything connected' how- ever remotely, with the government of this great country is important, our ac- tion to-day may have far-reaching re- sults. We should, therefore, carefully consider such subjects as may be brought before us that we may decide wisely. We may congratulate ourselves on the improved prospects of the Republi- can party since the national committee met in this city four years ago for the same purpose that we are now assem- bled. At that time the majority against the Republican party in the North at the hist preceding general state elections, counted up into the hundreds of thou- sands. The great states of New York. Pennsylvania and Ohio had Democratic governors, New York selected by nearly 200,000 plurality, which was reduced tor the same candidate in the presi- dential election to less than I. too. Though by accident the Democratic party have, the presidency and the pres- tige of success, the signs are auspicious for the election of a Republican presi- dent in It***. momentum acquired by twenty-five years of the prevalence of Republican principles has not yet lost its force and the material interests of the country are still prosperous as the result of industrial legislation. Recent utterances, however, indicate a deter- mination to end this prosperity by ad- verse legislation forced upon the coun- try by an administration hostile to American industry; and also indicate the necessity of tlie return to power of ! the Republican party in tin* national j government, so that American industry. i wool growing and sugar raising, equally j v.ith iron making and textile produc- { lion, may have continued prosperity. I and the employes in these industries j constant employment and continued j good wages, such as American work- ! iiv:-n should receive. j THE 

ROLL WAS Till:.'.* CAT.T.K1), | mm every state and territory, with one J or two exceptions, was represented by j n dele-ate or a proxy. The delegate se- { lected from Kentucky, J. '/.. Moore, hav- ing removed from the state, the Hon. I G. M. Thomas was admitted as the tem- | porary representative of Kentucky at the prc-eid meeting. A committee of tin < members of the Republican national Vague 'appeared. ' and through its chairman, .1. Hale j Syphcr, renewed the invitation ten- I dered by the league t<i the committee to ! bold its meetings at the league head-' quarters, and the invitation was unanimously and cordially accepted. The committee then adjourned, to re- assemble at the league club house. A recess was taken long enough to enable the committer to take possession ! of their new and far more agreeable quarters, and when Chairman Jones ' again called the members to order an : informal discussion ensued as to the i time which should lie allowed to the representatives of the various cities I which are competing for the prize of : holding the next Republican convention j to present their respective claims. It ! was finally decided that fifteen minutes i should be accorded to each delegation. j and the first delegation admitted was ! from ! THE 

STATE OF MINNESOTA. I A large number of gentlemen bearing j badges indicating that they were pres- I ent to advocate the claims of Minneap- I olis. Their spokesman was ex-Senator t WiutJom. who gave the reasons why he I thought that Minneapolis should be i favored by the committee. He guaranteed on behalf of the citi- I zens of 1 hat city that the traveling ex j penses of delegates should not be j greater than it the convention should j be held in Chicago. Should the conven tion meet at Minneapolis, ample hotel ; accommodations for 411.0. people would i be provided at the usual rates. All the j usual expenses of the convention would : be paid and all the usual courtesies i extended to the national committee. j A hall with a seating capacity of j over 11.000 will be extended for the j meeting of the convention, and suitable | headquarters for every state and terri ; tory would be provided in the same I building. St. Paul and Minneapolis j were united in the effort to secure the ■ convention at the latter place, and the j rest of the. country should encourage j their friendliness. [Laughter. He had , nothing to say against any other city. j but he warned the committee that the . coventiou. after sweating for a week in j Philadelphia. St. Louis or Chicago, | would wish (hat it had met at Minneap- I olis. St. Paul and Minneapolis had ! grown up under Republican political I principles; they had partaken of the 1 benefits of Republican policy, and he ; wished to show how they, had pros j pered under that policy. Minnesota was neutral as to candidates, and all would I be treated fairly. There were thousands j of men in the state who hail ability to j be presidents, but Minnesota had : no candidate. An 'issue had been I made by the president in his message and the Republican party must act ! upon it. The issue was that of protec- I tion or free trade. The president had ] adopted a form of message never lore • h -ard of. He had f. rgotten to acknowl j edge even what divine providence had ! done for the country, ami had rushed j into the tariff ss the issue Itetwen the two ! parties. He (Window I was glad thai j the issue had been made. Did gen- tlemen think that when the* question was to be between free trade and tariff I it was necessary to carry coals to New : Castle by going to Philadelphia to make j a Republican platform. The Democrats i knew that there was an element in the ! Republican party of the Northwest that j wasn't as sound on the question of pro i lection as it ought to be. Was it not to the interest of this committee to take i the convention to the great Northwest, . where it would do the most good'.' SKXATol* W lNlinM I alluded to the propinquity of Minneap- ', olis to the great ten*. lory of Dakota and severely arraigned the Democratic party I for refusing to grant admission to the j union of states, of a territory containing . 000,000 intelligent people.' merely be ! cause they were Republicans. Gen. T. j I>. Henderson, of Missouri, ailed as ' spokesman for a large delegation of ! gentlemen who were admitted to pre j sent the advantages of St. Louisas the I convention city. He presented the I plans of the ('rami Music hall of St. I Louis, and explained that in this build- ling the committee might have a choice of halls one accommodating I.hjo, one 6.000, and one 11.000 persons. He ar- | gued that the hotel and railroad facili- ties of that city were excelled by none ' and. in behalf of the press, he promised 1 entire fairness of treatment to all the j candidates who might be forward j for tin* suffrages of the conven- ; tion. He referred to the light : which the Republicans of his 1 state had been making since the war I and the continual defeat which they had ; met. He predicted, however, that the electoral vote of Missouri would, in the next election.be found in favor of the nominee of the Republican convention, whoever he might be. Col. D. P. Dyer, : of St. Louis, in a vigorous speech sec- onded (it'll. Henderson's desire that St. j Louis should be chosen, and declared that as on a fair vote the city was Re j publican, the hoiding of a convention : there would greatly encourage and help ; Missouri Republicans in their tight. i The convention should be assembled j there because it was a central point and : because St. Louis had no tight to make on any man who might be a candidate. (hi the issue made by the president's message Rupublicans could go into the mining and manufacturing portions of the state and carry Missouri for the Re- publican party. [Applause.] The Mis- j souri delegation having retired, the committee at 1 :">0 took a recess for one hour. After the recess 1 1 1 1*. 

CHICAGO l>KI.Kl*AT10N was admitted, ami Max or Roche, of 1 j Chicago, in a businesslike manner de- | j tailed the conveniences which could be j accorded the members of the convention ' I by Chicago ill case that city secured the j favorable vote of the committee. Chi- J cago proposed to do as much and more j : for the accommodation of the convention ; j than she had done four years ago, and j 1 he claimed that she was better pre- ; I pared than any other city in the country | , to care for the; visitors to the conven- . 1 tion. He. as mayor, would be pleased j j to have the convention meet in a city 1 I which had grown to be what site was ; under the protecting influence rtf a tar- iff. [Applause.] Senator Culloui earn- ! estly^jrged the committee to select (hi- i cago, and he made a brief resume of the j hotel, railroad and telegraphic facilities of the city. Chicago to-day was in favor I of protection, and had been improved in I other ways since Iss^. It had had much 1 to do in grappling with the element of j communism and socialism thai had been ! spreading over the country. It had j been settled by the authorities of Illi- ■ nois that a man who disregarded the rights of property and the law and government could not live in Chicago or in the commonwealth. [Applause]. He hoped that Chicago would be -elected. but whether it were or not. Illinois ami Minnesota and Nebraska and Kansas and Iowa would stand by their odors and vote the Republican ticket. Sena- : tor Mamleison -poke for Omaha—that ; young giant of a municipality, situated I in the heart of a continent and upon ■ the banks of the greatest river in the j world. After setting forth the enliven ! iences which could be afforded by j Omaha, he denied that lie was over ] estimating them in the -lightest. If the ! convention were held there, when the j work was completed the members of 1 the committee would realize that the j ' gentlemen who wore here. repTPseiltlltg I Omaha had been characterized by an Immoderate degree of modesty. [Ap [ plause and laughter], in the next elec- I ! tion the Republicans would snavi: TO ATTAIN success and he believed that they would do so. I Without dispaiarcuieiil »0 the great Last from allied the active blood of the I West came, he contended that the' proper place tor holding the convention was in the West not west of Ohio or J Illinois, or more, but that great West 1 that was the 'ii.t born child of tbe lie- I SAINT PAUL, MINN., FRIDAY I MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1887. t i publican party, grown into proportions that those unfamiliar with it could not I realize. With the magnificent issue j that the enemy had forced upon the i party, the East should not demand that i the convention should be held in that : section. Among the farms of the West | there was missionary ground— not that ; he believed that any of that glorious I galaxy of Western states that had stood | by Republicanism for many years were ; showing signs of deserting the great re ; publican principle of protection— not by any means— but those Western states ought to be strengthened, the " conven ! tion ought to be held in one of them.and : Omaha was the location to be preferred. It had been said that the gentlemen ! who advocated Omaha did so for the I purpose of advertising the city rather j than for the purpose of obtaining the i convention, lie refuted the charge. | He and his associates were not here for '■ dress parade, but for active service, not for the active service of Omaha, but for ac- tive service in the cause of Republican j ism. He proceeded to detail the advan- tages of Omaha, and amongst other i things stated that the city was pre | pared to supply headquarters for every j presidential candidate free of charge. ; It had no choice for president. . It was | for the nominee of the convention. It | would furnish music and decorations i and press facilities and every thing or | anything else that was wanted. "Every thing we have is yours if von 1 want it." exclaimed the speaker, and : his earnestness created applause and j laughter. "I feel like adopting the sug- gestion of the Democratic stump orator. who said after announcing his plat- form: "Gentlemen, them's my senti | ments, but if them sentiments don't ' suit you. them sentiments can be i changed.' [Laughter.] If you want more than we offer you. say so. We '< want this convention and we want it ! badly. [Laughter and applause.] A | dispatch was received and read by the ', secretary from Mayor Francis, of St. : Louis, offering the committee, in behalf of the citizens of that city, every facil- ity and convenience for holding the ■ convention. ' ; Tin: 

DELEGATION FROM OHIO • was then admitted and Congressman Ben Butterworth presented the claims • of Cincinnati as a place peculiarly suit- able for holding the next National Re ' publican convention. The delegation for which he spoke was a thoroughly representative one, its members coming from all parts of the state. It did not appear in the interests of any candidate. The selection of a candidate must be | the result of the intelligent choice of a ' convention representing the preferences of the Republican party. In the matter of convenience and accommodations . which could be accorded to the conven ' tion, Cincinnati stood second to no other city. The music hall would accommo | date 7.000 people exclusively" of the stage, and the local committee would ! make ample provision for music, decora • lions, etc. .Nothing would be wanting j to provide every comfort and facility for : the delegates. Almost in the shadow of the tall building in which the conven ! tion would assemble, old Tippecanoe lay hurried, and to the north lay the re- I mains of Tom Corwin. Within the cor i porate limits of Cincinnati. Salmon P. ! (base, who first represented aggressive Republicanism in the United states sen- ate, slept his last sleep. If there was . any inspiration to be found in the sur- \ roundings, it would be found in (Mucin ; nati. This might be sentimental but he I thought that the Republicans believed : in sentiment. It was the life and soul of the Republican party. [Applause.] The convention would be sur- rounded by the ashes of illustrious men and would meet in the midst of ; illustrious memories. If it could not, : : with that presence and under that in- \ spiration, nominate a ticket which the '. '■ Republicans could elect it would be be- cause the frowns of the eternal were . upon the R ■publican party. Ohio would j ) put 1 e:* lance in rest for the nom- i inee, and stand in the front rank, halt i ing and failing in nothing. Surrounded ' by Tennessee. Kentucky and West Vir ' ginia, ( Into held the center of the battle field. West Virginia and Tennessee wore in sympathy with Republican ideas, and Kentucky had demonstrated how much she could do under the lead ! ership of men who really meant busi i ness. [Applause.] Mr. Mural Halsted, ! of Cincinnati, seconded Mr. Butter : worth in his praises of Cincinnati. He described, with some minuteness, the hall in which the convention could be j held and ! COMMEXTEDOX IIS ABSOLUTE SAFETY | ami upon the great facilities for reach : ng the hall from all parts of the city. i As for the press of Cincinnati, he felt ' qualified and authorized to say that the Republican papers would treat all can ; didates of the Republican party with ab '■ solute courtesy and show them perfectly ] fair play. This was not only their duty • hut their disposition. In urging the j claims of Ohio, he asserted that the most brilliant Republican victories won since I the evil days of the Democratic admin- istration were those won in that state, and Republicans coming to Cincinnati would find the city government in the hands of their friends. The element of "Mugwunipery"' had been extinguished so that Cincinnati was troubled with it no more. The. simple truth was that the I Republican ticket would get a better | send off from Cincinnati than from any | other city in ths Union. 'Applause'.) I Congressman Harry Bingham, in an eloquent speech, presented the claims of : Philadelphia. Col. William C. Khun, of Richmond. Va.'. presented an argument ill favor of the Republican parly of that state. He was accompanied he said by members of the senate and house of rep- j resentatives of Virginia, and by its five ; or six Republican members of congress; ; they represented the Republican party : of Virginia. lie read a paper which had j been prepared in the form of an address ' to the committee, and which reviewed the history of the Republican party in < that state since !s:s, The election in ; Virginia bad been egregiously misrepre- sented. They had carried 50 out of 100 counties, had elected in out of 10 sena- tors. Tout of lo congressional districts. All this they had done with strict bona fide Republican votes. He stated these facts to show that the national Repub- lican organization of Virginia was not inefficient or unsuccessful, and to dem- onstrate that with the cordial recogni- tion and support of the national Repub- lican party Virginia would give her electoral votes next year to the Republi- can candidate for the presidency. [Ap- plause] Gov. Gillette, of Dakota, presented the claim- of the people of thai terri- tory to the regconition of the Repub- lican .National committee, ami said that they would send delegates to the next convention on the basis of two terri- tories, and he hoped they would be j •ecogui/.edo and admitted. He de- scribed the treatment of Dakota to the present administration as the blackest page in the blackest book of American history. They had been afflicted by a man of "Sparks*" [laughter] whose aim was to deprive the people of their home- steads tin the most frivolous pretenses.

BILL ERWIN'S BIG DAY The Noted St. Paul Lawyer Lets Himself Out at - Sioux City, And Makes a Fiery Plea on Behalf of His Client, Arensdorf, Who Is on Trial for the As- sassination of Rev. Mr. Haddock. Lou Murray Sentenced to Ten Years at Stillwater— Two Men Killed. Special to the Globe. Sioux City, Io., Dec. 8.— Attorney Erwin. for the defense in the Arensdorf case, continued his argument to-day. At the adjournment of court last evening this gentleman had talked only about fifteen minutes, so that in fact his argu- ment begun to-day. He opened by a neat little complimentary speech to the jury in which they were called kings, and urged to decide the case as to them appeared just. The counsel for both j sides were then lauded and Attorney Argo was nominated for governor Of Iowa. The state's counsel were termed the "hope of the invaders of our rights, of the fanatics of our time."' Referring to the Clark law he said: "While it was legal IT WAS REVOt.1 TlOXARY in its character, and an invasion of the liberty of the citizens of Iowa. I will forever hold. that it was an invasion of our ancient liberties. The Iowa legis j lators, in yielding to the demand of ; these fanatics, have been guilty of a 1 breach of legislative trust, and given aid to a movement intended to enslave the sovereign citizen. It is dangerous, I as it is a .damnable betrayal. In the I laws of Cod there is no limit placed j upon the right of men to eat, drink and I be merry. To some men it is a benefit to drink liquor. The slate legislature might as well prohibit the making and eating of cheese on account of | constipation, as to prohibit the drinking of liquor on account of intoxication."' i Mr. Erwin then reviewed the effect of i the lark liquor law upon Sioux City. i He held that the great and promising ; I city had been checked in its growth ami j ! stood stagnant to-day. V short time ! prior to Aug. 3, lssii. the' 'people of j i Sioux City saw this. There are no laws I '. to control the fanatics and the-, sent out 11.11. Leavitt to murder Rev.' George Haddock. All surrendered to the fanatics. The police yielded. DEBASEMENT OF ItEl.lliloN ! followed the passage of this law. Re ! ligion engendered a war of hate. Rev.' George C. Haddock, a minister, entered the war and armed himself with a weapon dangerous and brutal.' How unlike the weapon of a true follower of i Cod. (In Sunday he preached, and on Monday he assaulted men with this weapon, Great Cod. all this under due form Of law! Was this peace or was it j war. war as bail as if the hand of a > united nation had been raised. The j citizens should have resented such a war. The war of Haddock and his fanatics could not be repelled. The judicial powers sustained them, the very law upheld them, and the people could no longer look to courts for refuge and protection. Meanwhile terror reigned in Iowa. People protested. I judges sought to find relief for the j people, but no relief could be found. ! The Republican party of Iowa stood j gagged and bound by this bondage. The ! business men of this city protested. | They saw disaster hanging over the city. They could not remove it. and to-day the terrible effect is felt by every citi- zen. The fanatical workings arc com- plete. The temperance alliance spurred on by its success, is to-day AN INVADER OF HOMES and destroyer of fireside ties, a sneak- ing peace-destroyer. They tell of the conspiracy of the saloonkeepers. Who were the aggressors against society, law and established customs? The fanatics. Mr. Erwin then asked the jury to go back with him to Aug. 8, 1888, when the fanatics were in charge of this court room, using the court to perpetrate their hates upon saloonkeepers. It is an open fact that had not Harry Leavitt killed Rev. Haddock ami entered into a conspiracy with the fanatics of Iowa, the legislature would have overthrown their law upon the demand of the people. The fanatics hold Iowa but by a single hair. They must play their cards fine, or to-morrow Liberty will have their heads." Re- ferring to Haddock, Mr. Irwin said: "By his dress, by everything about him, he was a crazy fanatic. He was a con- spirator- an armed conspirator. Mr. Haddock, by acts higher than all human testimony, is proved to have been an' armed and disguised conspirator— a prowling, midnight, law-breaking eaves-, dropping conspirator. (This denuncia- tion of Haddock was hissed.) A con-" liscator, an informer. A STIRRER-! I' OK STRIFE. What a candidate for a martyr, and that he has billed all over the world as a martyr is known to all. Col. Wood as eo-conspiiator poses as his companion at- New York in the Cooper union. They tell us he was a preacher. 1 suppose a* preacher may do anything he wants to. On that theory he may be a martyr. Mr. Haddock is where 1 cannot hurt him— * dead by an assassin which he himself awakened from the brothel and.the slums. Haddock had taken the livery of heaven, but was it to serve his God? lie drummed with his weapon on the lazar house, and an inmate came out and slew him. AV hat- ever respect you may have for the class that teach the way to heaven, you can not. as citizens, regard him as having any title to this respect when yon find him armed. Religion is debased when it is prostituted by man. No mere call- ing of Mr. Haddock can save him from the imputations that fall on one fouud conspiring, meddling, prowling, as he was. on the night of Aug.:;." At the afternoon session Erwin continued much in the same style for some time and then TOOK IP AN ANALYSIS of Leavitt and Arensdorf to show which of the two men would be most likely to commit the crime, He argued at length that Leavitt had changed his Chicago residence on the instigation of the pros- ecution, and the prosecution was ac- cused of procuring this false evidence to convict an Innocent man. At the evening adjournment he had not. com- pleted bis argument and will probably occupy most of to-morrow, as he has not yet got down to an analysis of the testimony in the case, which is very vol- . uminous. The court room has been packed all day, but no demonstrations ' like those of yesterday have been made.' An evening paper says that "Attorney Kr a in played to. the biggest audience ever us.vinbied in Sioux City, lit- is a good actor." During the morning ses- sion a little girl entered the court nous**: and presented Attorneys Erwin and Tredway with a basket of cut flowers. They were from "A friend." It is now thought improbable that the case will be given to the jury this week. LOU MURRAY. He Is Convicted and (Jets Ten Years in Prison. Special to the Globe. Buffalo, Minn., Dec. The jury retired at 11:15 o'clock last night and reached an agreement at about 1:30, but did not report until 7 o'clock this morn- ing. The verdict was guilty, as charged in the indictment. Murray was sen- tenced to ten years. The prisoner left on the '.) o'clock train this morning for Minneapolis, where he will be confined in jail until Judge Hicks makes a de- cision on Murray's attorney's motion for a new trial. MURRAY SURPRISED. Lou Murray, in talking with a Globe reporter, said: "I was very much sur- prised at the verdict of tlie jury in ray case. I felt confident that the jury- would disagree, and when I heard the verdict I almost fainted away. I think it was a great mistake, having my trial at Buffalo, where the jury was composed entirely ot farmers who knew nothing of city life, i think if I get a new trial and can have it here In Minneapolis with a jury composed of men acquainted with the ways of a city 1 will be ac- quitted. Wendell, one of my attorneys, 1 think is a good one, but Cochran, the other one, don't amount, to much." He seemed to think that Ryan, of St. Paul. had not treated him very well in refus- ing to defend him. TWO MKN" KILLED. Result of a Collision on the North- ern Pacific, Near Brainerd. Special to the Globe. Bralwrd, Minn., Dec. 8.— At 4:30 this morning two freight trains on the Northern Pacific railway came together just east of Tamarac station, causing a pretty bad wreck, besides killing two hrakemen and seriously injuring an en- gineer. It is understood that the trains had orders to meet at Tamarac, but for some reason the train going east, of which D. W. Travis, of Brainerd. was the engineer, did not stop as ordered, j but proceeded east, with the result stated. It is given out that Travis was ' asleep when his train passed Tamarac. ; Ed (Mine, head brakeinan on the west ; bound train was instantly killed, and O. ' W. Holmes, brakeiiian on the other I train, was fatally injured, and died be ; fore reaching this city. Both were ter- J ribly mangled. Travis, the engineer, | had his left arm and head badly lacer \ ated, his right wrist severly injured. , and was scalded about the head and i shoulders. lie was brought to the sani- I tarium here. Though his injuries art; j severe they are not of a serious char i acter. ('line and Holmes both belonged | here and the latter leaves a wife and ! child. look- Rather Suspicious. Special to the Globe. Mason City, lo., Dec. 8.- The news of the arrest of Charles H. Klinefelter, son of A. N. Klinefelter, a wealthy barb-wire manufacturer of Joliet, re- ceived here to-day, is the all-absorbing topic of conversation. He came here in the early part of May ami at once went into the employ of the Express-Repub- lican company as a reporter. His uncle was one of the proprietors. He was at once taken into the social circles of the city, and was one of its leading lights. He went into the employ of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul company the 1st of November as night baggageman. Two weeks ago he unexpectedly re- signed, assigning no cause, and stating that he was going to Chicago. The day he resigned a trunk that had been checked from St. Paul to Sioux City was missed at this point: Comparison of the office books with the train baggage- man's books showed that a trunk had been checked from here to Chicago which was not recorded on the office books. On account of Klinefelter' s sud- den resignation suspicion at once point- ed to him as being connected with the robbery of the baggage. An interview with Agent Allan revealed no more than the above. Freight Trains Collide. Special to the Globe. St. Cloud, Dec. 8.— A disastrous col- lision occurred on the tracks of the Hinckley division of the Manitoba road and the Northern Pacific at the crossing of the roads, just east of this city, early this morning. A heavy freight train on the Hinckley had passed about half its length over the Northern Pacific track when an east-bound freight train on the latter road came thundering along, crashing into the side of the Hinckley train. Owing to the dense tog which prevailed last night, Engineer G. W. Cooper, of the Northern Pacific train, says he was unable to discern anything until he was right on to the train, which was drawn across the track. He imme- diately reversed his engine and, together with the fireman, jumped and escaped without injuries. Eight cars of the Hinckley train and three of the North- ern Pacific were totally demolished. The engine of the Northern Pacific train was also badl y damaged. Mankato Court Cases. Special to the Globe. Mankato, Minn., Dec. 8.— the district court, now in session here, four indictments have been returned by the grand jury and several other cases are yet to be examined. The prisoners at present in charge of the sheriff are Christian Miller, charged with horse stealing: William Ennis. charged with larceny: Hester Ann Simonds and Asher Morgan, each charged with big- amy.

FAIR TRADERS. Those of England Vi.w Presi- dent Cleveland's Message With Alarm. With Alarm. They Also Regard the Cheap- ness of Bread As an "Un- ness of Bread As an "Un- m mitigated Curse." Relations of the French Re- public to M. Goblet and Gen. Boulanger. Mandeville Put On Bread and Water — General For- eign News. Copyright Cable to the Globe London, Dec 8.— President Cleve- land's message has made politicians on this side of the water rather more thoughtful than usual concerning the condition of England's tariff laws. A feeling is undoubtedly growing in En- gland in favor of a moderate duty on imports, and popular sentiment points in that direction. At the large fair trade meeting which was held in St. James" hall this afternoon Howard Yin- cent, member of parliament for Shef- field, who presided, said that the cause of England that was uppermost in the minds of the people was this question of duties. He said that England for a quarter of a century had been the vic- tim of other countries owing to her per- sistence in holding to free trade. Re- ferring to President Cleveland's mes- sage, he said that he viewed his sug- gestions and recommendations with alarm. Mr. Vincent stated that a reso- lution had been adopted by the free trade party to place the food producers of England on an equal footing with those of other countries. Mr. liter, who moved the resolution, contended that the present cheapness of bread was an unmitigated curse. Commoner Albert Munz supported the motion and spoke to the same point. THE 

EVIDENCE in the case of Doherty, who is on trial for shooting Graham, has been given so far chiefly by the servants of Doherty's house on Woburn place. They swore that they heard a great noise and sound as erf scuffling and also testified to the prisoner's indifference alter the shoot- ing, when Graham was dying. Russia's action of massing troops along the frontier is considered by some to be of little importance and the agita- tion caused thereby being only a Hash the "pan. "*"_*-<"o"'rCTlofis consciences are expected to arise from it. The military council held by Emperor Francis Joseph at Vienna was unevent- ful, with the exception of its resulting in sending a warning to St. Peters- burgh. The Crown Prince Frederick William at San Remo still continues to improve in health, and the German physicians, or at least some of them, are now trying to persuade people that the prince's affliction is not the serious one that had been stated. The best authorities, nev- ertheless, see no reason to reject the cancer theory. THE FRENCH UlipUBIilC. M. Goblet's Preferment, and the Possible Triumph ol" Gen. Bou- langer. Copyright Cable to the Globe. London, Dec. 8.— The announcement that M. Goblet has agreed to undertake the construction of a government for France attests the accuracy of the oft repeated assertion that French states- men and politicians are a close corpora- tion in respect of the division of, or ro- tation in office, no matter what their apparent differences may be. M. Gob- let is himself a comparatively new man in French politics, yet he has on one occasion held the oflice of premier, and is firmly established in his place on the list of eligibles for any cabinet position. As often as a ministry falls the timber for a new cabinet is selected from the pile of possibilities and the rest carefully put away for the next crisis, together with that just fallen, which comes out again as good as new when wanted. Ever since the establishment of the republic the same corporation has monopolized the cabinet-making business, the only changes in the personnel of the firm being made by the addition of a new name from time to time as an old one disappeared from the roster through the death of its owner, so that it has come to be a matter-of-fact thing in the world to regard this or that gentleman's appointment as certain under a par- ticular premiership. MM. De Freycmet and Goblet departed to a certain extent from the established ml**, the one by appointing and the other by retaining Gen. Boulanger as minister of war, and of course in the estimation of THE ENEMIES OF THAT OFFICER share the responsibility for his innova- vations and the political turmoil he cre- ated at the close of his ministerial ca- reer. Gen. Boulanger has the advan- tage of experience in addition to the other valuable qualities he possesses, and M. Goblet could do much worse than to recall him to the war office, Whatever may be Boulanger's faults, it is as plain as' the sun at noonday that should France become involved in war within the next four years she will have that unquestionably brilliant organizer to thank for any success she may achieve, Gen. Ferron, his successor, tried in vain to improve upon the work done by Boulanger, but was unable to do so. and was reluctantly compelled to carry out some of the plans the former minister had formed and complete much of the work he had left unfinished on the lines he had laid down. Gen. Boulanger was made an issue In the construction of the Rouvier cabinet and may become a factor Jin the formation of its successor. THE CABINET. It is reported that the cabinet will be composed as follows; M. Goblet, president of 'he council and minister of the interior. M. Itibot, minister of justice. M. Flourens, minister of foreign affairs. M. Heard, minister of education. M. Loubet, minister of agriculture. M. Mt-nftrd-Dorii'ii, minister of public works. M. Clamagcnm, minister of finance. M. Siegfried, minister of commerce. M. Bourgeois, minister of marine. Gen. Fcvrier or Gen. 'J'lioina.sin, minister of war. .V.

LIBERAL UNIONISTS. They Hold an Important Con Ter- ence at Westminster Hall. London, Dec. 8.— Lord Hartington presided at tlie conference in Westmin- ster hall to-day of Liberal Unionists. Many leaders of the party were on the platform. Sis hundred delegates were present. The earl of Derby offered a resolution in favor of increased exer- tions to strengthen the Unionist party, lie said that the constituents, especially those of Scotland, showed a marked in- crease of feeling in favor of the dissed- ents. The Irish question had been so prolonged that it is possible that the people might say it must be settled somehow: but they should be made to understand that the granting of an Irish parliament would be no .settlement, but only the beginning of an agitation as violent and as troublesome as the last one. Lord Harrington, replying to a vote of? confidence, denied that the Unionists had deserted Liberal principles, which, he said, did not belong to one man or one party. If they had agreed to Mr' Gladstone's home rule scheme they would -have falsified the pledges they had made before the general election. Lord Hartington continued: "We were told that the mode of operation in lie- land HAD 

BEEN CHANGED owing to the sympathy of Englishmen. Rut we did not see such a great change. Boycotting, intimidation, resistance at evictions and non-payment of rents con- tinued as before, with the open support of a portion and the toleration of all the English home rulers. Remember Mitch-* ellstown has been Hung forth to animate the passions of the people in theii» struggle against the law. Every method of open resistance short of rebellion hag been resorted to with the tacit consent of Mr. Gladstone and the Liberal : leaders. The Unionists had a satis- I factory understanding with the Con | servatives, and would continue to act , with them." Referring to the fair trade : movement Lord Hartington said it was I not possible to speak in too strong terms j of those who spoke of returning to a ! policy of protection. He hoped the Con i servative leaders would weigh well the j consequences before they gave their I succor and support to a policy which would lead to the disruption of the Unionist party. Those who advocated fair trade must be responsible for the consequences. Harrington Convicted. Dublin, Dec. Edward Harrington, M. P., was tried in the Tralee court to- day on the charge of publishing in his paper, the Sentinel, records of meetings of suppressed branches of the national league. The defendant's solicitor ob- jected to the proofs offered of his client's guilt, hut the magistrate overruled the objection. The solicitor then withdrew from the case. Mr. Harrington was found guilty and sentenced to a month's imprisonment, hut without hard labor. Notice was given of an appeal from the sentence. The Crown Prinee.
