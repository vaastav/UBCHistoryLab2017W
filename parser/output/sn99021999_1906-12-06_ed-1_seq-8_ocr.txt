President Roosevelt's declaration In hi1:' message to congress yes terday on'.'tha treatment accorded to Japa nese in the San Francisco schools specially appeals to tlie British at the piesent time, because both In South Africa and Australia a similar anti-Asiatic (eclinx h.is created embarrassment for the imperial authorities. During the present week, the home British government vetoed a, "Transvaal ordi nance'' further restricting (he privileges of Drltlnh Indians, evsu those long resident In the oountry. while quite recently the government refused to accept an Austra lian . proffer . of a preferential tariff "pro vided the goods were shipped In vessels not employing yellow seamen."

The reply of Maitre Cruppl, counsel for Count ..Bonl ; de Castellane and the former countess. In the suit of their creditors, consumed the entire session of the tribunal of first 'instance of the Seine today. M. Crnppl described how the trades men's and usurers' bills had been cleverly mixed up and reiterated the perfeet willing ness of Madame Anna Gould to settle the legitimate debts, although a delay was nec essary', as there were no funds from the trustee of . the estate at : her disposal at present. Counsel argued that It was unjust and Illegal to attempt to make Madame Gould responsible for the enormous funds borrowed by Count Bonl of usurers to meet his "mad extravagance and princely prodigality."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 The house to day passed the bill permitting nntional banking associations to make loans on teal estate us security and limiting the amount f such loan. The vote was 111 to 51. - Tho bankers In the house urged' the pas sage of the bill, while the opponent AX the measure insisted that real estate was not a proper security for national bAnks. They contended that the pyEtem had proved a failure wherever tried. Mr. Do Armond of Missouri thought the bill wan bad legislation, a' It would tend to limit the power of the state banks. "Any man who has unincumbered real estate can get a loan at a lower rate of Interest from loaning companies than he can from a bank," he said. Mr. .Hepburn of Iowa and Mr. Williams of Mississippi, the minority leader, were enthusiastic In favor of the measure, urg ing that the bill would aid the farmers very greatly and have a tendency to reduce stock circulation.
