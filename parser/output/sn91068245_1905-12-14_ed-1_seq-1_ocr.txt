RUSSIAN GENERAL KILLED Former Minister of War Sakharoff is Assassinated With a Revolver in the House of the Governor of Sara toff by a Woman Who Had Asked to See Him. London, By Cable. The St. Peters burg correspondent of The Daily Tele graph, in a dispatch dated December 5, sent by way of Edytkuhnen, Prus sa, says: "Lieutenant General Sakharoff, former Minister of War, was assassi nated. "The government had deputized General Sakharoff 0 visit the pro vince of Saratofr, for the purpose of quelling the agrarian riots there. "A woman belonging to the so called 'flying columns' of the revo lutionary movement, called at the house of the Governor of Saratoff at noon and asked to see General Sak haroff. "She nred three revolver shots at the general, killing him on the spot. "The tidings' reached St. Peters burg. Count AYitte charged Lieuten ant General Kudiger, Minister of War, with the task of breaking the news to Mine. Sakharoff. "The event has created a profound impression in St. Petersburg, owing to fears that the revolutionists here will follow the the example thus set. "The spectre of a military distator ship, which has been looming on the horizon, is slowly gaining consistency and sharpness of outline. "I am personally convinced that Count Witte's faith n the good sense and political tact of the Russian thinking classes, wlfich recently was as firm as a rock, is gradually weak ening, and with it bis hopes for the carrying out of the fiberties promised in the Emperor's manifesto." Fearful Conditions Prevail. St. Ptersburg, Special. Intense alarm prevails here. Communications with the outer woild by telegraph ceased when the Finnish operators joined their Russian comrades. The embassies, legations and banks are hastily organizing courier services to both Finnish and German frontiers. The population is almost in a state of panic, fearing that the railroads will stop running and that the inhabitants therefore will have no mode of flight in the event of the cataclysm which the- seem to fear is imminent. First Train to Knoxville. Nashville, Special. A big crowd gathered at the Tennessee Central depot to see the first Illinois Central and Southern trains leave.

A mis trial was ordered in the celebrated $200,000 suit of the Stale aaginst Architect Frank P. Milburn and Con tractors Mcllvain, Unkefer & Com pany for alleged faulty and fraudu lent completion of the State capitol. The jury had been out since 10 o'clock Wednesday morning. It cannot be said with ceraiuty how the jury stood, but members of the panel say that the vote stood through out eight for a verdict against the de fendants of $65,000, three for a ver dict for the defense and one willing tc compromise on a small verdict against the defendants.

RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, THURSDAY. DECEMBER H, 1805. A WOMAN HANGED The First Female Legally Exe cuted in Years LEGAL EFFORT FOR MRS. ROGERS Mary Rogers Left Her Husband Over Two Years Ago Afterwards Af- . . f ecting Reconciliation at a Meeting Place Agreed Upon. Windsor, Vt., Special. Mrs. Mary Rogers, the woman who murdered her husband some 2 years ago and for 'whom so much has been done to have the sentence of death changed to life imprisonment, was banged Friday afternoon at 1:40 o'clock, at Wind sor, Vermont. This ends one of the most celebrated cases in the criminal history of this country. Mrs. Hogers went to her death with out any show 01 emotion. She made no statement or confession. A short religious c?reinony whs held with Father Delaney, just before the march to the gallows. Before the signal was given to sprinir the trap she nod ded her head that she was ready. Every ingenious device, known to law, was used to save Mary Ifogers from the gibbet, and it was not until the case was disposed of by the Su preme Court of the United States late last month that, all hope was given up of saving the woman's life. Had there been one mitigating circum stance; had there bcon one spark of womanliness in Mary Hotrers. had she shown slight possibilities of regene ration, Governor C. J. Pell, of Ver mont might have interfered. The murder was as brutal as that of Mrs. Martha Place, who hacked her step daughter to pieces because of jealousy, in Brooklyn. Gov. Hoossveii declined to interfere and save her from elec trocution in .March, ISDO. Ginners' Association Report. Dallas, Special.
