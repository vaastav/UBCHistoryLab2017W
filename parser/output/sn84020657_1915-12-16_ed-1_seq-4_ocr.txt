Alaska, under the Act of Mhrch 3. 1879. PRAISE FOR MESSAGE. The Boston News Bureau, the Wall Street Jour nal and other financial newspapers vie with the daily and weekly papers of the South and West in praise for President Wilson's message. It Is stated by the Wall Street Journal that the message was received on the "Street" with favor, and the Chicago Herald. Independ ent, says it was received by the people as a new dec laration of Americanism and adds that it will leave a lasting impression on the American people. The Boston News Bureau, which says that the dif ferences over the message will not be as to its intent or the principles involved, but will be as to the details only. It follows this declaration with the statement: "The more one studies business conditions the more one is impressed with the improve ment under way. "All through the West sentiment Is most optimistic. Then again, the most gratifying re ports are those coming from the South. When we recall the situation in the South a year ago the contrast is most striking. "It Is generally believed that 1916 will be a most prosperous year for business men in all lines. It is believed further that conditions will be such as will generate the initiative, and that we shall see a breadth beyond any dreams of a year ago." And it may be added that the new year seemB to promise to introduce a new wave of Wisconsin popu larity such as has cn several occasions swept over the country. The St. Louis Republic predicts that by the t mo the Presidential campaign is fairly under way. President Wilson will tower so greatly above everyone else in the public eye that his election will have been conceded. 

SENATOR COCKRELL The death of Senator Francis Marion Cockreli. of Missouri, removes a man who was a prominent and highly honorable actor in the theatre of American public life in his day. He served his state according to bis conception of his duty faithfully, efficiently and hon orably In the Confederate army, during the Civil War. Afterward he became an able lawyer and entered poli tics. a: did so many of his associates. And his upward career was one that is familiar In the United States. He became a member of the State Legislature, a Rep r< ent&tive in Congress and a United States Senator being a colleague of the late Senator Vest. In the St. Louis convention which nominated Alton B. Parker for President, he received the support of his-state for the Presidency, and was supported in the balloting by Will Jam J. Bryan. He retired from the Senate, where he took prominent place, when his state went Republican In 1904 and elected Senator Warner, a Republican. Ho was a man of the highest character, and one who served his country well. President Wilson and four members of hlB cabinet voted for woman suffrage this year. Tho President and Secretary of War Garrison voted for the proposed con stitutional amendment in New Jersey. Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo and Secretary of Commerce Redfield voted for votes for women in New York, and Secretary of Labor Wilson did likewise In Pennsylvania. Secretary of State Lansing could not get away to New York on election day, and, as a result, he did not vote at all. One of the most appreciative Christmas gifts this year to Juneau will be the addition of several hundred people to the city through the extension of tho city limits. And Juneau's return for the gift will bo citizen ship In tho best city of the West to several hundred J ,<ood Americans. I 

INTERESTED IN* WIRELESS (Fairbanks Times.) The efforts which arc to be made this winter to widen the field of usefulness of the wireless stations throughout Interior Alaska will be watched with In terest by the public. Any move in the direction of Improved service between Alaska and the States will bo welcomed. It may not bo possible entirely to elimi nate the delays Incident to the frequent breaking of the cable, but if these periods are only partially bridged by the wireless stations, they will have rendered a valuable service to Alaska and Alaskans, especially those residing In the Interior country. So long as we are compelled to depend entirely upon the cable, there is little liklihood that messages will travel with greater certainty than they do at present The cable Is undependnoic. It is old and worn and rests on a bed of rocks which constantly threatens interrup tion. We need an auxiliary cable, but lacking that, we should have some other means of avoiding costly and annoying Interruptions which are becoming more fre quent as the years pass. AN 

UNCLOUDED INTELLECT (Seattle Times.) Field Marshal Von Hindenburg is something more than a successful soldier. He is a student of Interna tional affairs and views them in a remarkably unpreju diced manner. The Times yesterday published a statement, given out by the genius of the East Prussian swamps In which the speaker bluntly declared that peace would not como immediately through mediation but ultimate ly as a result of engagements on various fields of bat tle. Hindenburg knows the Russians are not at the end of their resources. As va soldier, he realizes that neith er Britain nor France has been weakened by the Teu tonic victories of this year. As a level-headed individ ual. he is aware that nations in such an admirable po sition as the Allies will not cease fighting while their foe is at the height of his military success. It has been stated on the best of authority that Mr. Wickersham is willing to accept the nomination of the. regular Republicans next year. This in itself suggests a most interesting possibility in territorial politics. It would seem impossible that all old wounds could be healed up so quckly. It is likely that some Republicans would be ready to support him If he returned to the fold, but the official heads could hardly ever in this world receive him with open arms. It is possible that the return of Wlckcrshaiu to the Republican party will result in splitting it in the territory.?Seward Gateway. ROCK SLIDE VICTIM TERRIBLY CRUSHED; INVESTIGATION MADE After searching for nearly twenty four hours In the slide rock and debris at the Alaska Juneau mill site, the body of J. C. Bynrd was found at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon a?<J ? moved from the place of the accident. The hody was found near the bottom of the slide and was terribly mangled. One leg was entirely severed from the body and the other was hanging by a few cords, while the head and shoulders were badly lacerated. Federal Mining Inspector S. B. Smith investigated the accident yes-! terday afternoon. After examing the slide he declared that indications ; were that the rock had caved by wa ter freezing in the fissures, causing an expansion. The rock at the scene is very blocky and it requires eternal vlligance on the part of the compar and the men. Inspector Smith said, to avoid accident. The ralll-slte is the steepest in the world. R. E. Walker, an undertaker of Bil lings. Mont., last night at the request of Byard's friends, undertook to make Byard's features recognizable. The body is atC. W. Young's.
