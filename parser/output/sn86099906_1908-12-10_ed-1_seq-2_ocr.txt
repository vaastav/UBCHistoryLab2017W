WHEELER, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1908. AN OMISSION. While the Waterways convention at New Orleans has made some strong recommendations to congress upon the subject of the construction of the intercoastal canal, it is noted that the recommendations have ig nored the necessity of constructing a channel to connect the bay of Brazos Santiago with the Rio Grande, in or der to give Brownsville connection with the canal. This is a very serious omission, and the people of Browns ville, who are as vitally interested in this subject ac the rest of the Valley, cannot afford to allow this matter to rest in this shape. If the. convention could not see after the interests of this town, along with the remainder of the coast country, then the citi zens of Brownsville should organize on their own behalf and see that their claims are not ignored. This is a most serious mattor, and Browns ville should look into It without de lay. The San Antonio Express gener ously offers to donate the last thous and dollars necessary to complete the $100,000 bonus for the road to Brownsville. The enterprise shown by the newspapers of the Alamo City should be an inspiration to the other people of the city. President Roosevelt's message ig nores the subject of the tarifi. He doubtless prefers to leave that bull for Mr. Taf t to take by the horns. 

PAULINO SANTOS COY. Well Known Ibuiclunan and Former Ranger Dies in this City- Died, in this city, at two o'clock this morning, Antonio Paulino Santos Coy, aged 53 years. The deceased was & well known ranchman of this coun ty, being a pioneer resident of the Valley, and having resided in this lo cality for about thirty-five years. He had been in town several days when he was taken ill with an attack of pneumonia, and from this his death resulted. Mr. Coy was a native of San Anton io, where he was prominently con nected, having come to Brownsville when 23 years of age. Soon after com- ing here, he entered the state ranger service under Captain Hall, and was a prominent member of the ranger force for a period of over twenty years. During the Garza revolution. Mr. Coy was employed as a detective and was associated with the United States officers in ferreting out the participants in that noted border dis turbance of years past. It is claimed that Paulino S. Coy was the man who fired the fatal shot that brought down the famous Ben Thompson, who was killed at San Antonio a good many years ago. and whose career is one of the interesting bite of Texas history of his period. This has never been ac tually verified, however. After leav ing the ranger service, Mr. Coy served in the capacity of deputy sheriff of Cameron county. For the past few years he has been making his home on his ranch. El Saltillo. near the King ranch. Deceased was married twice. His second wife, two daughters, and one son, the issue of his first marriage, survive him. besides three brothers and two sisters. Alphonuo Coy, a brother and his two sisters. Miss Mary E. Coy and Mrs. Refugio Coy Delga do. arrived in the city last night in re sponse to a message received Monday stating that he was seriously ill, and were with him at the time of his death. Funeral arrangements have not yet been completed, as they are pending the arrival of his wife who is expect ed home tonight.

.ADVERTISE IN THE MStcaxi- HaMasn Colonization Company, RESOLUTIONS ON WATERWAYS ADOPTED BY WATERWAYS CON VENTION Ai NEW ORLEANS. Favor Construction of Intercoastal Canal to Connect Donaldsonvllle on Mississippi with Rio Grande Rec ommendation to Congress- The following resolutions were ad opted at the Waterways convention held in New Orleans last week: Whereas, It is essential to the com mercial progress and material devel opments of the States of Lousiana and Texas that the intercoastal canal now being constructed from the Mis sissippi river, at or near Donaldson ville, to the mouth of the Rio Grande river, should b.e constructed by the Federal government to a depth of not less than nine feet and a width of not less than one hundred feet at the bottom; and. Whereas, The Federal government has recognized the importance and feasibility of the construction of such a canal and appropriated for its par tial construction and are now engaged in active work thereon;and therefore Resolved, That we earnestly urge upon Congress now in session the ne cessity of making adequate appropria tions for the sneedy construction and completion of this work and recom- ' mend that same be done under con tinued contracts. That we endorse the construction of a canal from the Mississippi river. opposite New Orleans, to Morgan City, La., as a necessity supplement to the present Intercoastal Canal route via Plaquemine Locks. That we endorse as meritorious the demands for Improvements of the va rious tributaries which are to furnish tonnage for the inland canal as fol lows: Arroyo Colorado, Guadalupe river, Colorado river, Buffalo Bayou, Yazoo river, Trinity river, Neches riv er, Sabine river, Mermentau river, Vermillion river, Teche river, and At chafalaya river and its tributaries. It being a fact that the government dredge boat is removing obstructions in the Guadalupe river from Victoria to the mouth thereof, we recommend that when this work is finished by it, It should be used to remove obstruc tions in the Guadalupe river from Vic torio, Texas, to Cuero,- Texas, as far as-practicable. That we endorse the demand of pnfctically the entire country for a deep waterway from the lakes to the gulf,, of which the Intercoastal canal is a tributary. That we endorse the action of the National Rivers and Harbors Con gress to appropriate not less than fifty million dollars annually for the improvement of rivers and harbors. That we recommend that the Con gress of the United States and State Legislatures pass laws applicable within their respective jurisdictions requiring that a railroad or railroads reducing freight rates to meet the ompetition of inland waterway trans portation shall be required to make a proportionate reduction to all inter mediate points. Resolved, Ihai tre thunks of this convention be, and are extended to the New Orleans Progressive Union, and to the committee in charge of the nterstate Inland Waterway's Conven tion of the City of New Orleans, and to the people of New Orleans, for their ccrdial reception to the dele gates attending such convention and for their many and long to be remem bered ewrtesies. Resolved, That the thanks of this convention are hereby tendered to Hon. C. S. E. Holland, presidpnt;Leon Locke, secretary and their associates in the Executive Committee of the In terstate Inland Waterway League of Louisiana and Texas.
