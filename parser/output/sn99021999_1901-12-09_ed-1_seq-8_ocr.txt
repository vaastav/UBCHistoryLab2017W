WALL STREET UNCHANGED xtrnnn nasi- C.len In llsn Tend ency hy IJontlnnetl Prosperity nit t.nrge Earnings. NK,1V YORK, pec. S. (Special.) Henry Clews of tho banking house of Henry Clows & Co. In his weekly letter says: The -Wall street situation Is practically unchanged. On the one side we sec Mocks powerfully concentrated In few hands anil At attempt made to raise values to a still higher level by means of various deals, bj encouraging easy money and by other artifices best known to skilful manlpila tors, Continued prosperity and large rail road earnings liavo afforded a strong basis for sunn a movement, and at the moment thero are no signs of pronounced weak ness, except the unsatisfactory develop ments In Amalgamated Copper, which have undoubtedly Imprded the efforts for a re newed bull campaign, The large Interests are unquestionably committed to the long side of 'the market; they have stocks to sell which the public are slow to buy unless they see more certainty of profit than lias beeu offered. Klmplc prosperity, some think, has been amply discounted, and reliance Is now often placed upon thn effects of deals which promise to Increase the dividend ca pacities nf certain securities. As a result the market Is strong only In spots, and weak spells are not Infrequent. Had tho market been allowed to settle down last summer to a lower level In nat.iral ro tiponse to the unfavorable Incidents which then occurred, we should have had a re covery and activity during the last two months which has been notably absent. Tho public, has wisely kept aloof from ex lenslvo commitments on the long side, con fining Its activities to quick trailing; and this Is likely to bo the safe courso for some time to come, or until natural Inlluenccs once more assert their sway. The situation In some respects Is very re markable. Never before wero stocks io highly concentrated, and the steadying Vower resulting from this processes highly significant. Apparently tho powers In con ittol arc able to hold tho market Impreg nable against all ordinary assaults, and while this situation lasts Judgment must be directed accordingly. At the same time slocks ate being slowly scattered, and tho latge sums nf money seeking Investment may enable the market leaders to success fully lighten the'r burden If prosperity con tinues sufficiently long, as some are bold enough to believe it will, Hut the business situation Is spotty. fSrcat activity Is ap parent in the Iron trade, whero tho physical revolution In railroad standards Is caus ing an abnormal demand for Iron. Thero Is also great prosperity In the coal trade, and an active demand at profitable prices for many artlclcH of food and clothing. Trices for these are the highest In ten years, and people are spending vastly more on luxuries and commodities appealing to aesthetic tastes than usual, Economy Is the exception and extravagance the rule, and how long this will continue no one knows. Thero are signs of reaction which only the blind will not see, anil they de mand caution. Wo will soon begin to visibly see the effect of thif corn crop fall nre and the consequent loss of freight to lines traversing the corn bell As a result prkes of cattle feed have risen abnormally. Another blow Is tho shrinkage In the cotton crop, which miJHt adversely a fleet Im portant sections of the south, High prices and scarcity are not conducive to con tinuous prosperity In spite of n delusion to the contrary which some people entertain. Still another unfavorable, feature has been the declines In our exports, which, though perhaps not permanent, Indicate a cessa tion of the oxcesslve, trade balances which have been a fruitful source of self-congratulation. Our exports of copper de clined about KJ.ooo.u'hi during the first ten months of 1001 and our exports of Iron manufactures showed a loss of KM.oOO.COO In the same period. Bilcli factors as these cannot be Ignored. They arc signs of our oeing at or near me top. mid cnmjnon prudence dictates caution In transactions entering Into the future. Those who anticipated a "strenuous" message from President Roosevelt were disappoinieq, i ne president s llrst message was a calm and conservative document, entirely free of radical or demagogical features. While his treatment of disputed questions could not be expected to please everybody, all agreed that his rrr.nmmeti. datlons were strictly within .the limits of safety. The financial community was chiefly Interested In his utterances regard ing trusts. Theso he treated In n frank. Judicial and tcmpernte spirit, nnd his Ideas upon publicity, neediest) to say. met with' unlvrmal approval, If such legislation as ho siggests were now force Wall street would be free today from one of It wnr.t uncertainties, and Amalgamated Copper nuuei ii, v ir- nn; p ni'r'KUHl ill mc inarKCl Many of the trust evils would lie eir.em. rectlve under reasonable publicity Tho prrsnu'iil ilinrrilll- eil mo ClirrenCV question to his able secretary, Mr. Gage, who treats this Important problem with unusual force and clearness in his annual report. There Is no domestic question of greater Importance for congress to wrestlo with than this one. The country needs u. clentlflc and automatic currency system In keeping with modern progress. The change can best bo made under prosperous condi tions. When reaction sots In and credit contracts, prejudice and Ignorance will be more difficult to overcome than now. Mr. Gage's remarks on the currency should he thoughtfully read by ever woll-wlsher of his country. The president's message Is n pronounce ment upon the great affairs of the day which will meet with Instant nnd hearty approval both at home and abroad, Its eminent conservatism must dispel any ap prehension of radical recommendations that may perhaps have existed among a few The president's attitude toward the vast business Interests of the country Is nn earnest of sound Judgment and thorough understanding, Tho Interests of labor and rapltal have allkn and equally been con sidered, The policy of publicity In regard .to the affair of so-called trusts Ik a very snlitary recommendation, which must carry with It the opinion of nil falr-mlndeil men. TarlfT modification Is very wisely routined principally to the Hook of reci procity. In fact the entire message may he aid to bo a guarantee of stability and har mony in governmental and foreign nffalrs. mnd henco a promise of continued pros, purity. Tho executive and legislative branches of the government. It Is quite clear from the message, are to act in liar niony, not discord, which Is a most gratify ing assurance to tho business Interests of the country.

It Is worths of notice, that the stock of American cotton at Liverpool and the quantity afloat of all kinds exceeds the record for the same period of If) by IS,rv boles and HS."0 bales, respectively.

There as a willingness to biy nl the price, nut traders were reluctant to follow the advance, , It Is staled, however, that the Krazlllau trade Is more hopeful. The position of yarns was stronger. Snlnncrs refused to do business except on tlie full advance of cotton and buyers rarely obtained a reduc- tlon.

T.-Specillators of stocks rushed to sell today and precipitated n vlohiit decline, which carried prices be low last Saturday's level, leaving no ves tige of the week's gains.

For the week receipts have been fairly literal, a slight Increase being noted over the corresponding week of last year. As compared with last week, however, there Is, a slight decrease. The demnnd from nil sources has been active, so that prices have advanced 011 desirable kinds. The supply of corn-fed steers wus very light all the week nnd the general market may be quoted IS'g'JSe higher thaif It was a week ago. It Is noticeable, however, that the greatest advance has been on tho short fed cattle, owing to the fact that the run of westerns Is now over with. Tho fin ished c.ittlo have not changed much, prices being about the same as they wero a week ago. Good to choice heavyweight cattle may be quoted from $0.15 to $7.00. Kalr to good steers arc worth from $5.50 to $0.15 nnd short-fed cnttlo are selling from $5.0 down. The cow market has also been very ac tive and prices have advanced all the way ftom 15c to 30c, The, market, however, has been more or less uneven, ,owlng to the rnpldljy with which prices have advanced. The greatest Improvement hns been on tho heavyweight fed cows of good quality, which may be quoted from $4,25 to i$4.75. The medium nnd light cattle have not ad vanced ns much, tint at the same tlmo prices uro better than they were a week ago. There has been nn nctlve demand for eannors nnd prices nro considerably .higher than they were n week ago, At some other points, however, the market eased off to wnrd the close of tho week, so that prices for tho coming week depend very largely upon receipts. Hulls, venl calves and stngs have also sold frely and prices are stronger than they were a week ago. There have beeu very few stockcrs and feeders nt the yards this week and ns tho demand for the choicer grades was liberal prices nro fully as high ns they were a week ago. The. demand continues best for the heavyweight cattle showing quality and also for prime yearlings, Tho common grades of all weights have moved very slnwlv. the demand from the country for that clans of cattle being extremely light. Good to choice feeders nro quotable from $1.75 to $1.25; fair to good, $3.00 to $3.75 and common from $3.00 dpwu. A'cry few western rattle are now coming oil the matket and most of those that do arrive are of common quality. Packers nro now nearly as anxious for the beef slecre ns they wero two weeks ngof thong!. tho better granca a.;u at very satisfactory prices, Cow stuff and feeders have fluctu ated .lust about tho same as Is noted nbovo for" natives, , HOGS There was n liberal run of hogs hero todny nnd as other markets were quoted lower prices at this point took a drop. Good, heavy hogs sold fully a nickel lower, whllo the, lightweights were hard to dispose of nnd were Hiil5e lower than yesterday and sometimes tho decline was even greater. Tho best heavy hogs, weighing .".( pounds nnd over, sold largely from $0.15 to W.'.'o. Good, heavy mixed hogs sold largely trom $6.0714 to $6.15. Tho bulk of tho lightweights went from $5.60 to $6.01). AVhllo the market was fairly active 011 tho heavyweights, tho light hogs sold very slowly and were left until tho last. Receipts of hogs this week have been fairly liberal, a good gain being noted pver the preceding wcck ano a sun greater over tho corresponding fweek of last year. In spite of the liberal run the tendency of prices has been upward and at tho close of tho week values aro about a shade higher than lliey wero iusi wcck. i no nign nay of the week was l-rlday, when values reached about l'i.30. which Is the hlnhest point since October.

The demand has been Just about equal to the supply, so that prices lisle not changed materially. Tho week opened with the market strong and active n,!d then toward tho middle of the week the feeling was' not so good, and prices cased ofT a trifle, Tho last two days, however, the market has been strong again, so that prices arc now back to Just about where they were at the close of last week, This Is truo of sheep ns well ns of lambs. The hulk of the offerings, now helng re ceived consists of feilstuff, so that tho feeder market Is rather quiet. So far ns prices f,re concerned, thero has not been much change.

VERY FEW IMPORTANT CHANGES IN PRICES .llrrrhnnts .Meeting; Their III1U Mnre Proiuptl) Tbnn lApccted In Vlnr nf Ciifinornhlr AVrnther, A' hi eh Itediierd .Snles, OMAHA. Dec. T. The total volume of business tnnsncted last week by local Jobbers was consider ably In excess ot that for the previous week. That was probably owing to a great extent to thn fact that the weather was colder, at least part ot tho time, than It has been of late. The snowstorm which visited ti largo part of the territory tribu tary lo this market also Improved trado on a good many lines, but principally on leather nnd rubber goods. The hollday trutlo also assumed very liberal prnpoi tlous last week, as merchants now tcnll.o that Christmas is close at hand and thai they urn going to sell more stock this year than over before. As 11 result they aro placing liberal orders for nil kinds of hol iday lines nnd Jobbers are rushed with mall orders of that character. Traveling men also picked up a good many orders In making their rounds, Thero wero comparatively few merchants on thn market last week, as tho majority of retailers arc too busy to leuvo their stores, Thoso who wer In. however, spoke very encouragingly both of Immediate bus iness and of tho prospects for future trade All they ask for Is seasonable weather for the rest of the winter, and with that they nre confident they will have a gooii, brisk demand. Traveling men are still meeting with good success In landing advance orders for spring, snd In fnct It is safe to say that thero Is not a Jobbing house in tho city which will not start In the. new year with more spring goods sold than over before. Thero have been very few Important market changes during the week, as most lines have, held steady. The markets as n whole aro In a good, healthy condition, with a tlrm undertone to tho trade. Mo More Chrnp Mugnr. Thn effects of tho sugar war nro tin longer felt in this territory. It may be said that practically all tho cheap sugar that was shipped Into tho Missouri rivet markets has been cleaned up, so that thero Is now a good, oven market, with all rentiers selling on tho Mini) basis they wero before the price-cutting was started. The market Is considerably tinner than It wns a week ago, owing to thn fact that the raw market has advanced 11 rhade. It Is predicted with a good deal of confidence that a corresponding advance In reftnni sugars will tnko placo In tho near future. In farinaceous goods thero has been 11 slight ndvance In oatmeal nnd hominy owing to the high prices ruling on oats and corn. It Is thought that stilt higher prices will ptevull In tho near future. Syrup hns also strengthened up for the same reason. Tho coffeo ninrknt Is In practically the same position It was 11 week ago. Prices aro fluctuating back and forth to somo e.. tent, but thero has been no permanent chnngo, In either direction. The ten mar kel Is also about the same as It was a week ago. Owing to tho light supply of both foreign mid domestic nuts prices are Arming up and still higher quotations arc looked for hi tho future. There luis been no Important chnngo In tho ennnen goods situation. Both corn and tomatoes continue, strong and those who aro posted say that higher prices will pre vail at no vecy distant date. Oysters urn also held nt Ilrm prices, owing to the fact that Ralttmnro packers arc unable to get enough stock to supply existing orders. The only chnngo In dried fruits Is 11 slight advance In currants. Other lines of dried fruits remain steady, with the demand rather quiet. Nulls MnrUed Down Ten Outs. The most Important chnngo In the hard ware market Inst week 'was tho drop In nails, amounting to"10 ccnis per keg. it Is claimed that this drop does not Indicate any general weakness In the Iron or steel market, hut is brought about through com petition between tho Independent manufac turers nnd tho trust. The capacity of the different mills Is considerably in excess of consumption, so that the Independent manufacturers have been cutting prices for tho purpose of moving their goods. Prices on hnrbwlro are tho samo ns they were, a week ago, ns tho supply and demand of that article Is morn nearly equal. Other lines of hardwate handled by local Jobbers are In about tho same position they wero a week ago, with the exception of lin seed oil, which eased off 2 cents. Raw Is now quoted at 52 cents and boiled nt , t cents. Turpentine Is steady at 43 cents and gloss Is olso selling nt tho same prices It was a week ugo. Tho demand for seasonable lines of hard ware last week was heavier than It has been for somo time past, which Is taken as nn Indication, by local Jobbers, that under normal conditions their trado would bo very heavy. Even under present condi tions they aro selling fully as much stock as they were a year ago, so they are doing no complaining. Dry Gnodn Move More Frrrly. There wns more activity to thn dry goodt market last week, but still the weather hns not been cold enough yet to mako tho demand for winter weight goods very brisk. Jobbers report a good mnny mall orders coming forward, but us a general thing they am rather small, showing that re tnllers have not sold as much of their stock as usuul at this time of year. When ever the tcmperaturo docs take a drop wholesalers notice n big Improvement In their sales, so that they figure It would not tako merchants long to clean up their stocks If settled cold weather should bo ex perienced, Thero Is practically no market news to report, ns all lines ojc In a good, strong position. Eastern markets aro rather quiet, with neither huycrs or sellers very anxious, nnd as a result but comparatively little business Is being transacted. Every one. however, seems to have a good deal of con fidence In future values, as It Is thought tho demand will continue exceptionally heavy throughout the coming season. Good ririunnd for Footuenr. Tho weather was very favorable last week for a brisk trade In both leather and rubber goods, The snow made heavy weight shoos fell at a rapid rate In tho country and nil kinds of rubber footwear also sold more freely than at any time this season, As a result Jobbers received rujli orders from all directions and sold morn stock than for a good many weeks pnsi. Retailers have been doing considerable complaining about tho weather nil this fall, but according to all reports received from the country they sold enough slock last week to go a, long way toward m'iklug up for lost time. Rubber bills fell due on December 1 and tho credit tnon of the different wholesalo houses say that collections aro coming In more freely than they exported hi view of tno light demand In tho country for rubber goods, It Is quite likely that thero will be a still greater improvement this week owing to the big sales of last week. There nro always a good ninny requests for exfep. slons of tlmo and this year Is no exception to tho general rule, but so far bills aro being paid up fully as promptly as they were a year ago.x Very few business fail ures have token place this season, so that jobbers' losses from that source have been very light nnd no trouble Is expected for retailers will bo lu excellent condition in soon as cold weather orrlvrs. Fruits mill Prndiier, Thero were almost no Important changes at all last week In the, prices quoted 011 fresh fruits and vegetables, Huslnem was not exactly rushing, but still there was a very fair demand both from tho country and thn city. Jobbers are shipping out Im mense quantities nf nuts, and that class of goods for tho Christmas trade and they look for n big rush from now until tho holidays, Christmas decorations have arrived nnd thn prices nt which the trees, holly and evergreen wreathing nud the vnilpushthcr - lines are selling win ii" niunu 111 uie limi tations given In another column. A big. do. mand for that class of goods Is looked for this season, so that stocks In Oils city aro unusually large. .... Tho egg market Is holding Just about steady. Very little strictly fresh stock Is arriving on in nijisn, ju-u ui; 10--mand Ik sufficient to tnko nil that Is of fered nl good, firm prices. The. demand for poultry was fairly liberal last week, while the supply was light, and prices firmed up considerably.
