BUTLEE MISSOURI. WEDNESDAY,! DEC. iC, The president's message, which .vas read to c--tigress last week, wi full of good, plain, hart! sense and practicable cuggetions. Col. ( rockttt, ot the Nevada Democrat, denies the statement that Mayor Gillespie wi 1 take charge of iis paper after h.s enstallment as I. Mat that place. Senatorial candidates announced are; Judge Sherwood, . N. Uurnes and F. M. Cockrell. We would like to I ear fiom some man that has .lot been holding; office a lifetime. The gts works at Kansas City were blown upTuesday ot last week, jtnd tor a tune the city was left in total daiknes. Coal oil lamps and allow candles .vere in demand ami now answer as a substitute. The tear i an utbieak of the Mormons has cau-ed the govern ment to dispatch Company IK with 6 field pieces and 400 troops from Ft. Omaha. Salt Luke City is now picketed with U S n.. (. The Jasper Coitniv D.u ocrat sa vs ihe time has been when he would Jet up in the middle of the night to work for Frank Cockrell, but certain .developments ot late have some what changed his mind, and he can low be found on the tence. We see from the Columbia Herald ?hat Capt. J. W. Kneislev, ex rep resentative of that county has been appointed custodian of the public 'Holdings jn Si Louis. Wonder if the oh' man will ''hoof it" to St Louis, us he did to Jefferson the inie he was elected representative? A special dispatch from Washing ton to the Globe-Democrat an nounce that in all probability out ot the naif dozen senators selected bv the president to represent the ad ministration on the floor of the senate, George G. Vest has been chosen , the mouth-piece through .vhom the president will talk. The Lamar Democrat thinks Berry Thurman, of that city, will be the next man to keep Judge Burton's seat warm in the judicial chair ot ihat circuit. Thurman, Thurman? Well, that is a very familiar name to us and we rather like it. Suppose Ihe democracy of that district try him one term. We believe he would uit all right. Affairs in Utah are taking rather queer turn. The Mormons are retaliating; on the Gentiles for inter ering witli their polygamous habits by having; some of the high officials of the State arrested on the same charges. This is accomplished by getting women to entice the unms meeting officials into forbidden paths and then "chirp on them. Tax Payer, through the columns oi last week's Rockville Globe, does considerable figuring in regard to ihe bonds of that township. Tax Payer th nks that, instead of de creasing their township indebtedness by compromising, they have Wh.iU.ti bE.a.LL IX BE? The boys are beginning to prospect for office m Bates county. What shall we have.convention or piimaiy r Now, that we have got used to it. We ithcr like the latter the best, but aie not particular: any plan that will give entire satisfaction. Democrat. The Democrat is right; it is about time that this question was being discussed and decided upon by the democrats of Dates county. The ..1 11 i...v-..i:.- campaign will, in an piuu.i.., open up by the February term ot circuit court. In fact, many of the bovs are already champing the bit a.id anxiously awaiting the drum tap to be off. The rules governing the 1 .... k.il' !.. iti r ice, as to wnemei c primary or convention system, is of i.otiance to the iimes, except X so far as the good of the party is concerned. The prunar system gave very general satisfaction betote and all the cry, which usually fol lows a convention, and m most cases justly so, of ring, combustions, trades, etc., was avoided. Of course it is poisible to have frauds in pri maries such as repeaters and ille gal voters, but if good and compe tent officers are selected to conduct the election all this can be avoided Then every democrat has an equal voice in saving who the party candi date .shall be, and not be compelled to vote for a man whom a ie-vv political bosses dictates, and w hose only qualifications tor office is that he happens to stand in with the ring. We repeat that cither sVtm would be pertectlv satisfactory wiilt llie Times; but, tor the good ' the democratic partv, we are co.npeiied to favor the Democrat's suggestion, and 00 not see that the party could do better than by retaining ihe ii i mary election system. We would like to hear from good democrats ali over the county 011 this subject. The democratic county central committee will have jurisdiction in the matter, but of course they will be governed by the wishes of the people.
