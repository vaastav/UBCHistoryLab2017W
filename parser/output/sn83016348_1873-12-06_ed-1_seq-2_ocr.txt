ELKTON, DECEMBER 6, ISTS. PREMIUMS. All Subscribers who desire to have a pre mium magazine with The Whig for 1874, are requested to send iu their orders ac companied with the money before the holi days. We wish to complete our lists and order the magazines by that time. —We publish a very comprehensive syn opsis of the President’s Message from the Philadelphia Ledger, the Message entire occupying more space than we could appro priate to it. The document is brief in the discussion of the many topics it touches, which is characteristic of the President. A man of few words, President Grant takes the marrow of his subject, and lays it bare without much thought about stylo or elo queuce of dictiou. To make bis meaning plain in the fewest words possible is his object. The synopsis we print of the Mes sage will be found to contain a brief re sume of all the topics of public interest and the recommendations of the President. THE 

MEETING OF CONGRESS. Both Houses assembled on Monday. Tbeie was a quorum of members present in each. The usual proceedings in the House inci dent to a new Congress were disposed of. The Hon. James G. Blaine was re-elected Speaker; the Hon. Edward McPherson. Clerk; N. G. Ordway, Sergeant-at-Arms; O. B. Buxton, Doorkeeper; Henry Sher wood, of Michigan, Postmaster; and Rev. J. G. Butler, Chaplain. The House did not complete its organiza tion till after the Senate adjourned, and in consequence the President's Message was not delivered to Congress till Thursday. The two bodies have scarcely got snffi ciently to work, yet to indicate the policy that is likely to bo pursued by Congress toward adjusting our financial affairs, which at present engross more of the at tention of the country than any other question of the day. — m 

MONEY! MONET!! MONEY!!! Friends, Fellow Citizens, Subscribers. Advertising Patrons and all others indebted to the Whig Office, lend us your cars ! Let us settle. “Money makes the mayor—or mare— go,” we never could tell which boss hard cash drove the most lively. We think the proverb of very doubtful significance. Money makes the press go is a better max im; and without it the machine must stop. Without mouey even the blood will cease to circulate, the breath will stop, the heart grow cold, and the fiesh drop from the hones. And it is plain that to be without money is a dreadful state of affairs, espe cially if you have earned it. Now this is our case; and as the end of the year ap proaches we always try to get square with the world. We invite all to call next week who Sttend Court and have accounts with The Whig, and settle. That will be a good beginning; then we will send out to all others a postal card, stating the amount of their indebtedness. We choose the postal card because the cost is about one-fourth of sending out accounts by letters through the mail, which is quite an item in mailing large numbers. Salary Grabbing and Hie Democracy. Every one knows how the Democracy denounced the Back Pay business in the last canvass. Their newspaper organs were full of denunciations of the great swindle, their conventions condemned it by resolutions in the most unmeasured terms, and their orators never tired ringing the charges upon it. Although a greater pro portion of their members voted lor the bill than of the Republicans, the latter were held responsible for the great scandal. But the leaders of the party meet at Wash ington and how do they verify ail these fine professions of repugnance to the grab ? Why by nominating Fernando Wood as the Democrat candidate for Speaker. Fer nando was one of the ring leaders in the “steal !” The New York Tribune, which has been patting the Democrats on the back and denouncing and finding fault with Grant and the Republican party ever since Gree ley’s great blunder, breaks out in the fol lowing strain at this last revelation of Democratic hypocracy. “ The Administration party has been guilty of some great follies and great crimes. Rut to repudiate that party and set up in its place one that has no more consistency, sincerity or honesty than has been shown by the Democrats in this mat ter would be turning out blunderers to install thieves in their places.” 0 m “ DEMOCRATIC RULE.” Under Democratic rule not only the State of Maryland, but the United States of America prospered and were happy. It was not until fanaticism and Inst got pos session of National and State Governments, that venality and vice were made honor able, and a proud people degraded by the corruption of tbeir rulers. If our country is respected to day, it is because of its physical strength, and in spite the moral putridity of meu in high places. Cecil Democrat. Secretary Floyd, of Buchanan's cabinet, was a pretty fair type of Democracy. He astonished the nation by stealing six mil lions from the Treasury, an Indian Trust fund, if we recollect properly. We believe that this is the only instance that a Secre tary has been know to rob the United States Treasury. It is not only a question of “ respect ” among other nations of the world, but one of existence as a nation, that our country owes to strength. The power that crushed a rebellion in the interest of slavery alone, was not encouraged or assisted by that Democracy of which The Cecil Democrat is a type and advocate, but was that self sacrificing patriotism and noble courage, out of which spung the Republican party which saved the nation when the Demo cratic party had become corrupt, venal and treacherous to liberty. — Vick’s Floral Guide For 1874.—W0 have received the first number ot this valuable publication. The Guide is issued quarterly at 25 cents a year, and any person making the least attempt as a florist, even to the extent of keeping a few window plants, should subscribe for a copy of the Guide. The amount of information one number contains is vastly disproportioned to the nominal sum asked for the whole four numbers. The present number has some valuable hints on Church and draw ing room decorations, with diagrams; and in forming letters and making wreaths. The Guide contains 200 pages, 500 engrav ings and colored plate. To any one desir ing to purchase flower or vegetable seed, there is no dealer iu the country we would | recommend with more confidence than James Vick, Esq., Rochester, N. Y. The Guide contains a price list of all seeds and ! Dowers and directions how to order.— i Packages of seeds not exceeding four pounds in weight can be sent by mail. j m —The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fee , Railroad Co. have sold 879,953 acres of railroad lands from April to October inclu sive, at an average of about $5.50 per acre. The sales during the month of October far exceeded those of any previous month, reaching 23,070. This will give some idea of the tide of emigration (lowing into Kansas. The Govcrment lands along this mad we are informed ere pretty much all taken up. THE 

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. The annual message of the President, is marked by bis usual plain, concise and straightforward style. Without following the order of the document itself, we shall begin our abstract, of the message with what is said upon the subject of Cuba, the Virginias affair and our relations with Spain. r l he President makes note of the welcome events which followed the inaugu ration of the Spanish Republic, specifying the abolition of slavery in Porto Rico, the release of several thousand persons illegal ly held as slaves in Cuba, the order for the restoration of the sequestered estates of American citizens, and the revocation of the power of the Captain Generals of Cuba to set aside the orders of their superiors at Madrid. These liberal measures encount ered violent opposition from the reaction ary slaveholders at Havana, and this latter baneful influence still exists, defying the home Government of Spain. It has usurp- 1 ed the powers of government in Cuba, is i exhausting the resources of the island, is I doing acts at variance with the principles of justice, and it is hoped that in the inter ests of humanity and of civilization this evil influence may be averted. Referring te the matter of the Virginius, i all the circumstances attending which are now well-known, the President says that the Spanish Government has recognized the justice of our demand, and has arrang ed for the immediate delivery of the vessel, for the surrender of the survivors, for a salute to the flag, and for proceedings look ■ ing to the punishment of the guilty per petrators of the illegal acts, and looking also towards indemnity for those who may be entitled to it. The diplomatic corres pondence on the subject having been con ducted by cipher and by telegraph, is with held for the present until the cipher dis patches can be verified by comparison with the original documents. This affair, which for a time threatened the most serious con sequences, is now in the course of satisfac tory adjustment honorable to both nations. The subject next iu importance relates to the finances and to the recent monetary i disturbance throughout the country. The President fears that the financial balance for the present year will not be so favor able as that of last year, and recommends economy in making appropriations and economy in administering the various de partments of Government. He points out two or three sources for such economy. Whilst he thinks the Government should owu buildings for its own purposes, he recommends that no new ones be under taken where work has not already been commenced, and that permaturc river and harbor improvements and fortifications should not be begun, and also that tribu nals should be established that will protect the Government against the fabrication of claims. As to the severe monetary dis turbance, the President intimates that, however much individuals may have suffer ed, the result may prove to be a long step towards specie payments, that we can have no permanent prosperity until a specie basis is reached, and that a specie basis uaunot be reached and maintained until onr exports exclusive of gold pay for our im ports. If but one-half of the gold extract ed from onr mines would be retained at home our advance towards specie payments would be tapid. To keep ttic gold we have and appreciate the currency to that stand ard is the problem for Congress. To in crease our expoits, sufficient currency is required to keepall of the industries of the country employed. He nevertheless dis courages undue expansion of the currency, which, while it might give temporary re lief, would oidy lead to inflation of prices. He would have the currency sufficiently “elastic” to keep industry employed, but not to run into inflation. To this end the President submits to the consideration of Congress a specific plan by which the National Ranks may, when more currency is required, procure an additional amount of circulating notes by the deposit of bonds (forleiting four per cent of the inter est while the bonds remain in the Treasury) and when the currency is no longer requir ed, having leave to withdraw the bonds upon the surrender and concellation of the additional notes issued to them. He also recommends that the National Banks be prohibited from paying interest on deposits: that they shall be required to hold their reserve in their own vaults; that “clearing houses” shall be established for the re demption of their circulating notes; and that they be authorized to diminish then standing issues ot notes at pleasure by the return and cancellation of their own bills. He thinks that if such “clearing houses” for redemption shall he established, it may be a question whether banking should not be made free, retaining all the present safe guards for the security of bill holders. As to other matters, the President rec ommends that so much of tlie Bankrupt Law as provides for involuntary bankrupt cy, on account of the suspension of pay ments, be repealed: he urges favorable action upon the recommendation of the Postmaster -General for the establishment of Postal Savings Depositories; lie calls the attention of Congress to the subject of a Postal Telegraph, but does not recom mend it; to prevent legal anarchy in Utah, he says it is absolutely necessary that Con grees shall provide Courts for that Terri tory with sufficient power and authority to put an end to the legal paralysis which now prevails there; lie mentions tlie im portance of providing proper armament Col our seacoast defences, and the necessity of reopening the line of piomotion in the start' corps ef the army, particularly in the Medical, Pay and Ordnance Department; lie reminds Congress of the necessity, as exemplified by recent events, of keeping the navy in a state of efficiency; he repeats the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior for a census to he taken in 18*5, and adds that the report of a census taken iu that year would be especially interesting and valuable, as showing the progress of the country during the first century of our national existence; he suggests the appoint ment of a special committee of Congress to act iu co-operation witli the Civil Ser vice Board; he recommends the encourage ment of an irrigating canal in the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to the Mis souri River, stating incidentally that he is opposed to further donations of public lauds to private corporations, but in this instance makes an exception; he suggests that the Governmeut as a national work, should see that the navigation should be kept clear on tlie St. Clair Flats, the llli nois and Mississippi rivers, and the over slaugh! of the Hudson river, as a means of facilitating cheap transportation by the Frio Canal and tiic Illinois Canal; and lie renews his previous recommendation to Congress for general amnesty to the small number of persons in the South who still labor under political disabilities in conse quence of their acts during the late rebel lion, and suggests the enactment of a law the better to secure I lie civil rights which freedom should secure to the enfranchised slave. Nearly all the other topics are of a rou tine character, except perhaps the anoma lous condition of our citizenship and ex patriation laws which require attention, •and suggested amendments to the Con stitntion to enable the Executive to veto objectionable parts of an act of Congress without vetoing the whole, and to confine the business of a “called session ” of Con gress to the business specified in the call. The “ Mixed Claims ” Commission, to hear j and determine claims of citizens of the I United States and subjects of Great ] Britain, have awarded British claims to the ; amount of $1,1)29,819; have rejected $9:!,- | 000,000 of British claims, and all of the American claims. Congress is requested I to appropriate the $1,939,819 for the dis- I charge of these British awards; and the j recommendation is renewed for a commis- i sion to audit and determine 'he direct loss- | es of individuals, etc., to he paid out of the $15,500,000 received from Great Britain j on account of the Alabama depredations. — —Fernando Wood of New York received seventy-seven votes of the eighty-one Dem ocrats present, on Monday, for Speaker of the House. Wood's latest exploit in Con gress was to carry the Salary Grab by changing his vote in its favor, after it had been defeated. _ Why don't The Cecil Dem ocrat howl? Seeenty.seren out of oighty oue of that white handed noble reform party vote to elevate the chief thief in the j Salary Grab to the speakership ! Put your j hand on your mouth and your month in ( the dust when yon feel inclined to arraign the Republican party as a party, ami ex- ! oncrate Hie Democracy as a party. It is plain that the public would gain nothing in honesty by substituting the latter for the former. Patrons of Husbandry. —Wo have heard it suggested that an attempt would he made among the farmers to open a Grange during Court, in this neighbor- ! hood. It is high time our farmers should begin to consult their interests by forming societies Perhaps the Grange plan is as good as any that offers. Some oppose it. J}llt any organization is letter than none. 1 

LETTER FROM KANSAS. Gulp House, Fort Scott, Kansas, November 34th, 1873. Mr. Editor:—l arrived here safe, after , a pleasant trip of five days’ duration, and in accordance with your request, will tell you something about this sectiou of Kan- ' sas. Fort Scott is situated on the lines of the Missouri river, Fort Scott and Gulf, and - the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroads, in the Southeastern portion of the State, 1 distant about 250 miles southwest of Kan sas City, Mo., and 00 miles east of the Indian Territory. It now numbers about 5,600 souls, and if Governor Sliephcid and i his Board of Public Works, of Washing | ton, were here a short time, it would soon j ibo made a beautiful place. It was first settled about forty years ago, at which time General Scott erected a large fort while fighting the Indians. Hence its name. On account of the scarcity of lum ber and brick, the houses are necessarily small, built in cottage style, and conse quently very much alike in appearance. A few of the streets are McAdamized, but none are yet very handsome. There are a number of quite large business Louses, however, and trade seems very lively. There are two average hotels here, who seem to do a thriving business at tbeir own prices. Rents are high, and the demand for houses is greatly in excess of the sup ply. If a man brings bis family and comes here to settle, ho must stop at a hotel, live in a tent, or build a house. If a man build and live in Iris own house, he can live much cheaper than in the East; but : the rates of board here are even higher | than in Washington, while the faro is not more than half as good. A newspaper editor told me this morn ing that emigration from the East is very heavy, there being an average of a thous and emigrants passing through this sec tion of country weekly, and says, “know ing whereof he speaks,” that the soil and climate arc not excelled by any portion of the habitable globe, and licit the major part of Eastern people who emigrate to the West arc settling iu this State. The soil is rich and fertile, and is, in many localities, underlaid by veins of excellent coal, the climate is mild and the winters short, while the farm laborer is cooled by refreshing breezes from the Gulf during the ho.test summer days. The farmer-, do not shelter their stock during any season of the year, except they erect a shed for their favorite horses during the winter. A great many emigrants are locating along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fee Railroad, as the lands of that road are said to be among the most beautiful and fertile in the State, and are sold on easy terras and long credit. But that which has given me the greatest surprise, was to sec people digging coal, only Ueo feet hdow the sur face, within 1 lie corporation limits of this place. It is said to be excellent coal, too. They were stealing it, however, as the authorities have stopped digging within the limits of the town. One gentleman told me that in digging a cellar for his house he got out enough coal to last him five years. Good quality of coal sells here from $2.00 to $2.50 per ton delivered at the door. The farmers peddle coal here in (lie same manner as the farmers of Cecil peddle wood in Elkton. Just outside of towu the fields are spotted witli the tents of miners. Most of it is shipped to St. Louis and Chicago. Them is generally about two feet of rich, black soil, a vein of excellent building stone, averaging one foot in thickness, and then veins of coal, averaging from two to twelve feet in thick ness. Game of all kinds is very plentiful here. Hunters bring in wagon loads of quail, rabbits, prairie chickens, wild turkeys and geese, squirrels, &c. A gentleman who was shipping game last season informed me that he paid, wholesale, for rabbits, 8 to 10 cents per dozen; quail, (or partridges') 30 to 50 cents per dozen; prairie chickens, which are about as large as ordinary farm hens, 10 cents per pair, and purchased wild geese, turkeys, squirrels, Ac., at about tlie same proportion. They are nearly all shipped to Chicago. A man can take a gun, go one mile from town, and kill as many prairie chickens as he wants. South of here, iu the Indian Territory and Texas, there are said to be an abundance of deer and buffalo. I have not been hunting yet, but will tell yon how I succeed when I do g<>- There is a species of rabbit hero called the “Jack Rabbit,” which are about three times as large as the ordinary rabbit, hav ing very large ears, and tbeir speed is said to be even faster than the deer. They are becoming scarce now, however, for as the country settle up they go further West. They are hunted only with grey hounds. It is said that when he is aroused from his I resting place by the ordinary hounds, he 1 starts off, like a locomotive, very slow, which greatly encourages the dogs, but after he “gets steam up,” ho leaves them with such rapidity that they invariably stop and look witli mote astonishment. They arc said to often run ahead of a loco motive crossing the prairie fora distance of fifteen miles before leaving the track. I have made u trip through the Indian Territory and into Texas as far as Denison, and will tell you something about the In dians and their country in a future letter. The remainder of Captain Jack’s hand were taken there last week. C. F. W. Card Etiquette. —Few not, in the im mediate circle of the bon ton have any con ception of the important part played by i cards in high society. A wonderful nig- 1 niiicance is attached to a few simple words, j or even a single word on a card; and the j arrangement of that word speakes volumes to those wlio understand card language. Louis Dreka, card engraver, 1033 Chest- 1 nut street, Philadelphia, lias issued a neat little pamphlet, which gives all of this ; curious information about cards; the most approved styles, their language, etc., etc. ; [ We make the following extract from this book of c ard etiquette: Etiquette does not demand the acknowl- j edgmentof an invitation to these weddings, Anniversary weddings) by presentation of valuable gifts. Members of the family or very intimate Mends, are the only persons from whom such gifts should be received. Invited guests should not absent them selves from such festive and agreeable j entertainments by any false idea requiring them to contribute costly presents. These remarks refer particularly to presentation of silver and golden articles. For amuse ment and sociability, Miles in paper, tin or wood may lie offered by casual as well as personal friends, on the occasion of paper, tin or wooden weddings. Every family wlrtch makes any preten sion of observing the rules of polite society, : or uses cards should have one of Dreka’s little books on card etiquette. The work : is got up in beautiful style, lined vermilion and initials. Mr. Dreka also manufact ures a Dictionary Blotter winch is a very useful article to have on a writing desk. Another Great Ska Catastbopiiy.— The French steamer Videdu Havre wasjrun into in mid ocean by tiio British iron sail ing vessel Loch Earn, on the 23rd of Nov ember, which struck her amidships, cutting a gap in her side twelve feet deep and tore the plating off thirty feet in extent. The Ville du Havre sunk in twelve minutes. Her living freight comprised 313 of whom only 87 were saved, of whom 27 were pas sengers, the rest were made up of the cap tain, live officers and 44 of the crew, Now York, Albany, the interior towns of Now York and Boston, were sufferers, with many French and several members of the late Evangelical Alliance, were thus sent into eternity! The event lias created the great est excitem-mt in Lmd m. The survivors were lauded at Bristol, England. NE WAD PER TTSEMENTS. ' NOTICE.
