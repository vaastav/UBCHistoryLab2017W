S LAST EDITION SATURDAY EVENING. TQPEKA, KANSAS, DECEMBER 7, 1901. SATURDAY EVENING. THREE CENTS. - y - 0 POLITICAUJOSSir Anti-Cole Men Trying to Curb His Boom. Expect to Do It With Seth Wells, of Erie. HE IS NOT WILLING. An Active Candidate For Office of State Auditor. How Hent Murdock Saw Presi dent Roosevelt. Tlwre Is a lull in Kansas state poli tics just now in the Republican ranks. , The candidates already in the field are getting their wind preparatory to mak ing a spurt just before the Kansas Day banquet. Those who are thinking of becoming candidates are keeping still about it with the intention to spring their booms with a flourish on January 29, the date of the big Republican ban quet. It is expected, however, that the polit ical pot will begin to boil more rapidly immediately after the holidays. . Then the wire pulling will begin in earnest. The big politicians will try to weed out the candidates who are offensive to them, or failing in that they will spring new candidates to kill off the others. This sort of tactics is being pursued just now by some of the politicians who are opposed to the candidacy of George E. Cole for governor. They are groom ing Seth Wells of Neosho county, for auditor of state. Mr. Wells is a candi date for the place, and is receiving a warm support in the Third district. The opponents of Cole are trying to extend Wells' boom over the state, hoping thereby to weaken Mr. Cole on the theory that it would not do to select two candidates so close together as Wells and Cole would be. " Cole's candidacy takes better with the people than with the politicians. He is the sort of man that people like to see in a public office, but he is not a politician and is not good at wire pulling. He is better at blocking schemes to rob the state than he is at fixing up schemes of his own to cap ture a nomination. The trouble in the Fourth congres sional district continues to wax warm. If it des not interfere with Ed Hoch's candidacy for state printer, J. W. Moora of Marion, will be a sure enough candi date for Congressman Miller's ps.ce. He is very much opposed to Miller, and stands ready to make a. fight against Miller in case he can do it without in juring Mr. Hoeh. In speaking of ths fiffht that is being made on Mr. Miller the Burlington Jeffersonian says: "So far most of the politicians put Coffey county in the Miller column, but an in surrection is brewing. A number of the cal politicians are against Miller and it seems certain a fight will be made .o secure an anti-Miller delegation to ;he congressional convention next year. The fight has not really opened but the forces seem to be lined up for the fray." The northern Kansas papers continue to say nice things about W. W. Cald well's boom for attorney general, al though Mr. Caldwell has thus far re iused to say that he will be a candi date. But he will not deny it, either, and this is taken to mean that he will make the race if he thinks he can win. Two other Fifth district men are also mentioned for the place, and if either of these insist on making the race Mr. Caldwell probably would not run, for it would deprive him of the solid sup port of the Fifth district. These other two who are in the "mentioned" class are F. I... Williams and C. C. Coleman, of Clay Center. They are law partners, and each Is insisting on the other mak ing the race. The result will probably be that neither of them will go into the contest, but will leave the way open for Caldwell. Meanwhile it might be a good plan to keep an eye on Harry Bone. He lives in the Seventh district, and has a reputation of getting what he goes after. When the Appeal to Reason, the so cialistic paper published at Girard, was barred from the mails some time ago on the ground that its subscription list was not bona fide, its editor, J. A. Way land, immediately asked his subscribers to sign a postal card stating that they were bona fide subscribers to the paper and mail it to him. The other dav Wayland forwarded a little matter of 4.000 of these postal cards to the post office department at Washington to show what kind of a list he has. In the meantime he has been sending out his paper by express. He threatens if the postal authorities continue to bar him from the mails to move his paper to Canada. Bent Murdock. who is camping on Congressman Millers trail in the Fourth district, is another Kansan who Is in favor with President Roosevelt. When Murdock was in Washington re cently he went to call on the president Congressman Long offered to introduce him to the president, but Murdock turned down the offer. "I didn't need anybody to introduce me." he said in telling of the incident. "There were a couple of big guards at the main en trance. They looked at me inquiringlv. Oh. I'm not a dynamiter.' I said, and walked on. At the foot of the stairs I met another guard. He didn't say a word, and I went upstairs and in the reception room to the executive office I met the old gray-haired man who has been doorkeeper there for twenty years. "I told him I wanted to see the presi dent. 'Are you a member of congress-' 'N Jt guilty,' was my reply. 'I am only a private citizen, and I want you to take my card In to the president.' "You see. Just after President McKin ley was inaugurated I put up 'Teddy's' name at the head of the editorial col umn of my paper for president in 1904. He wrote me a very nice personal let ter at the time and I didn't think he would refuse to see me. "Just then Congressman Long came In. He asked me if I wanted to be in troduced to the president. I told him that I guessed it wasn't necessarv, and Long went away. A minute later the doorkeeper called my name and I went In and had a ten minute talk with the president. Got what I wanted and came away. "You can say that J. M. Miller is not going back to congress. We are going to beat him out in our district." The list of "mentioned" for the Pop ulist congressional race in the Sixth district is being made up. It includes A. T. Rodgers, who has represented tiitcheU county In the legislature, and i ' R. V . Turnt-r, of Mankato, who was secretu, -v of the board of railroad com I "lisslonj-s during the Leedy admin ; i:- -ition. It is possible that Webb Mc- rv u may also be sprung as a cand di.i". Webb made the race for congress once l.i-teie in the Sixth district, but it was on Lie Republican ticket away back in lSi.0, the first year the Popu lists captured the congressional dele gation. Webb was snowed under by 1111am .Baker, the first Populist the Sixth district sent to congress. Congressman-at-Large Scott, who la new on the Kansas congressional dele gation, writes interestingly of the man ner in which President Roosevelt gets through with a lot of congressmen who are falling on him. A congressman in W ashington js of much less importance than he is at home. "There are so many congressmen here." writes Mr. Scott, "and they are chasing around all over town hunting places to live like college students when the term opens. One bumps up against them everywhere particularly if he happens to be in the same business, and there fore naturally drifts to. the same places they do. There were a dozen or more at the White House the other day when 1 went to pay my respects to the presi dent. It didn't take the president long to dispose of them, and yet he was not rude, or even brusque. He began with the man nearest him, took him by the hand, maybe both hands, told hi:n he was delighted to see him, maybe told him so twice, thanked him for calling, asked him to come again, shook his hand the second time and turned to the next man. It is really interesting to see how little time it takes him to empty a big room and he doesn't send anybody away either." James M. Chisham, the postmaster at Atchison, will have a bill introduced at the present session of congress to re imburse him for over $700 of govern ment money which he had on deposit in the Atchison National bank when it failed, and which he had to make good to the government A similar bill was introduced in the last session and was favorably reported, but congress ad journed before it was reached on the calendar. It is customary to reimburse a postmaster in an Instance of this kind. When W. H. L. Pepperill, secre tary of the Democratic state committee, was postmaster at Concordia, thieves stole about $1,S00 of government funds from the postoffice, but after some time had passed congress reimbursed Mr. Pepperill for the loss. The possibility of a fight over prohi bition in the Republican state conven tion is already bringing out a number of expressions on the subject. Wr. M. Beck, of the Holton Recorder, is againsc a prohibition plank in the platform, "not," he says, "because we do not fa vor prohibition, but because we do. We have prohibition in the constitution and in the statutes. It has been there for 20 years, and is there to stay. If there is any issue that is settled it is that of prohibition in Kansas, and every con test that has resulted in favor of the principle has been won largely by Re publican votes. Everybody knows where the Republican party stands on this question, and there would be just as much sense and propriety in putting in the platform a plank against human slavery or one in favor of public schools and the homestead law as this one pro posed." It is nevertheless a fact that there is a strong element in the Repub lican party which is in favor of repudi ating prohibition. The Olathe News-Herald is mad at Congressman Bowersock for appointing Charles Sprsgue as postmaster at Ola the. It says that Mr. Bowersock might have prevented much bitterness if ha had named Mr. Sprague before the con test began if, as his friends claim. Mr. Bowersock had no intention of appoint ing anybody but Sprague at any time. Hera is a comment by Morton Al baugh who is both state bank commis sioner and also chairman of the Repub lican state committee: "About two years ago it was claimed that a man from Oklahoma went to Washington hunting for a federal job. He tried to enlist a Washington friend who asked him relative to his home endorsements. With a look of scorn and disgust, he replied: 'Endorsements, h 1; down there its a question of affidavits.' - Kansas at Washington is rapidly getting in this same predicament. And it's not all the fault of the people doing the kicking and protesting. If good, clean men were always named there would be no occa sion for such affidavits, and protests against appointees or proposed ap pomtees, would be a rare thing." The candidacy of R. B. Welch for as sociate justice recently received a little push from the Osborne Farmer. After saying some nice things about Mr. Welch the Farmer concludes: "Located as he is, in the First congressional dis trict, he thinks the present distribution of members of the court will be favor able to his aspirations, there being two members of the court now residing iti the Fourth district, and one in each of the others excepting the First, which has none." Considerable interest Is developing in the contest over the attorney general ship. The principal candidates men tioned thus far are Judge J. S. West, of Wvandotte countv: Harry Bone, of Clark; W. W. Caldwell, of Cloud, and R. W. Blue, of Cherokee. Judge West is Attorney General Godard's chief as sistant. He will probably have the Second district solid for him, and prob ably considerable support on the out side. His home now is in Kansas City, Kas., but he formerly lived in Linn county, and served on the district bencli down there, making an excellent record. Harry Bone is the retiring assistant Fluted States district attorney, whom E. D. McKeever will shortly succeed. Mr. Bone will receive the support of the southwest. He represented Clark county in the legislature before his ap pointment as assistant United States district attorney, and in his four years' term in his federal position he has made an enviable reputation as a lawyer. And to add to this his personal popularity extends from one end of the state to the other. W. W. Caldwell is one of the leading attorneys of the Fifth district, and is chairman of the Cloud county Republican central com mittee. Ex-Congressman R. W. Blue is not an avowed candidate for the place, but his friends are pushing him forward. Blue himself Is looking for something better he wants to be pen sion commissioner, to succeed H. Clay Evans. There are a few others in the "also mentioned" class, but their booms are not growing to any great extent at present. A boom has just been started for S. J. Osborn, of Salina, for superintendent of insurance. Osborn was speaker of the house in 1899, but was defeated for re-election to the legislature because he was a Burton man and his county was opposed to Burton. He was a candidate for United States district attorney, but failed to land and was sidetracked with the promise of a job of some kind in the Indian Territory, but the Indian NEW 

PHONE RATES B. F. Pankey Announces What They Will Be. Business Houses to Pay $36 Besidences $30. SAME AS THE OLD. Xew Company Schedule No Low er Than the Bell. All Subscribers Will, Howerer, Have Metallic Circuits. The Independent Telephone company today announced the schedule of rates that will be charged for telephones connected with the exchange of that company. They are: For business houses, $36 per year. For residences, $30 per year. Party lines of three or more, $18 per year each. The announcement of the rates to be charged by the Independent Telephone company carries with it disappoint ment to many who have anticipated a fight being inaugurated by the new tel ephone company on the old company by means of rate cutting. "In view of the fact that our serv ice will be much superior to that of most cities," said B. F. Pankey to a reporter for the State Journal today, "and in fact Is not surpassed by any telephone service in any city in the world, we cannot afford to install tele phones for a sum less than that an nounced." Beginning with next week the work of placing the telephones in ththouses of the subscribers to the new line will begin, and by January 1 over 300 tele phones will be in actual service in To peka on the exchange of the new com pany. "We have had over 500 applications for telephones, voluntary applications, too," said Mr. Pankey. "We are unable to put telephones up for all of the ap plicants before the first of the year for the reason that we are unable to get all the material here and get it put up in that time. "Our men have been as busy as pos sible, and as yet we have only five cables up with a capacity of 60 tele phones to each cable. Other cables will be put up as fast as possible, however, and the remaining number of appli cants for phones will be served." Every phone put up by the Independ ent Telephone company will be prac tically a long distance telephone. Each phone will have a metallic circuit: that means two wires leading all the way from the central office to the telephone to make the complete circuit, instead of depending on a ground circuit, the system now in vogue. A ground circuit is where only one wire leads from the central office to the telephone, and the circuit is completed by running a wire from the telephone to the ground out side the house. The system is consid ered very unsatisfactory. All the wire used in the erection of lines throughout the city will be cop per. No iron wire, the kind always used, except for long distance 'phones until recently, will be used In any man ner by the new company. A reporter for the State Journal was shown about the exchange office of the new company by Mr. Pankey. The workings of the "exchange board" were carefully explained in detail. "You see," said Mr. Pankey, going to a telephone that hung on the wall, "there is no crank on our telephone for the subscriber to use in calling cen tral. By simply lifting the receiver to place it to your ear notifies central that you want to call a number." Then Mr. Pankey pointed to a little light that burned in the switchboard directly over the number of the tele phone he had taken the receiver from. "That light is turned on or off by tak ing the receiver off the hook or re placing it." he said. "When central sees the light burning at any number she first asks what number the subscriber wishes to toe connected with. Then when the plugs are placed in position to connect the two 'phones, two lights burn in the switchboard opposite the plugs. The lights burn as long as the parties are talking. By hanging up the receivers at both ends of the line, the lights are caused to cease burning and 'central' is thereby notified that the parties are through talking. The hanging up of the receiver is an equivalent to Ringing off" under the common system. "There are never any crossed wires to trouble patrons of our exchange," continued Mr. Pankey. "Everyone may rest assured that their conversation cannot be heard by other parties by means of crossed wires or that they can hear anyone else. Of course every one may hear each other on party lines, but we have an added advantage for subscribers to party lines. The sub scriber never rinrs a bell, to call cen tral, only lifts the receiver from the hook. That action is recorded only in the central office and does not notify other subscribers on the line. Thus they are unaware the line is in use un less some one on the line is being called. When one party is using the line, an other party cannot 'cut-in.' " DARK MURKY DA Y. Little Bain but Weather Is Cool and Unpleasant. This has been an unpleasant day, with a continuous drizzle. The precipi tation was only .03 of an inch up to 2.30. Following are the temperatures, as recorded by the government ther mometer: 7 o'clock 34 1 11 o'clock 31 8 o'clock 33 12 o'clock 32 9 o'flock 32 1 o'clock 32 10 o'clock 31 I 2 o'clock 32 Wind blowing eight miles, from the north. Territory job has not yet materialized, and now his friends are booming him for superintendent of insurance. An example of the irony of fate is amply exemplified by the appointment of J. M. Simpson to succeed M. W. Sut ton as collector of internal revenue for Kansas. Mr. Sutton was presidentof the first Roosevelt club in Kansas, but nevertheless it is decreed that President Roosevelt himself chops off his official head and retires him to private life. Months ago, when the Roosevelt boom for president in 1904 was first sprung, Mr. Sutton organized a Roosevelt club out at his home in Dodge City. Mr. Sutton is not sore at being let out, however. He has been expecting it for some time, realizing that it was one of the results of the election of Mr. Bur ton to the United States, senate. 

CORN'S Ni May Option Closes at 69 Cents in Chicago Market. Chicago, Dee. 7. Sieculation on the board of trade was on the rampage again today. Once more record prices in all grains were topped and bull en thusiasm ran from pit to pit, setting all traders in a fever of excitement. The conditions back of the upward whirl of prices were almost identical with those that started the strong bull movement here Wednesday and Thursday. Al though the visiting stockmen are rapid ly leaving the city, many of them are still buying. Country orders especially for wheat deluged the commission houses this morning before trade opened. Added to this big demand however, was a new and powerful bull incentive, that of capitalistic specula tion. Prominent brokers say that the country has gone speculation mad, and that men who usually dabble in stocks are turning to grain. Trade seemed almotst to ignore the early natural conditions which usually turn markets. However the news to day was bullish. Both Liverpool and the 4 English country markets were strong, the outside American markets bullish, and receipts were reported fall ing off. These influences augmented by the report that Wall street was strong ly buying in this market brought open ing prices to 14 cents higher for December wheat options and to 1 cents higher for May. Naturally these bulges brought heavy liquidation, and prices stood well, and reactions brought them up again on every bit of bullish news. December ranged early between 77V& and 76 cents, and May between 0Bi and J14 cents. Corn and oats, though both excelling records for many years, followed large ly after the lead of wheat. The cash situation in both these cereals is very strong and the supply markedly lim ited. December corn broke the record at the opening 1(51 to c higher than yesterday at 65465c to 65VsC. May corn opened to i cent higher at 68c to 68c, sagged off to 6S68J4c, on profit taking, but soon reacted again to 68c. Mav oats opened to 1 cent higher at 46 to 4694c and after breaking slightly, turned very strong and sold up to 47c. The small sag in grains af ter the strong early opening lasted only a short time. Overwhelmed by the rush of orders from every side brokers bid madly for cereals at new record prices. W'heat was in most demand and at one time sold at 3(&3c over yesterday's close. December wheat closed at its top price, 22VsC higher than yester day at 78e; May wheat touched 83c and closed excited at a gain of 2c at 82S82c. December corn did not feel much of the reacting impetus but closed strong c up at 64c; May corn set its new record price at 69c and held it at the close, a gain of 14e over yes terday. Oats likewise felt the strain and jumped 47147c, closing lc higher at 47c. wilTWeat. Democratic Central Committee Decides Against Banquet. Question of an Official Organ Hot Decided. It has been officially decided that there will be no Democratic banquet on Jackson Day. The Democratic state central committee which has been in session at the Throop today, so decided this afternoon. This action upholds J. Mack Love, Democratic state chairman, who turned down the banquet proposi tion about two weeks ago, and has been criticised by some of the other Demo crats in the state for doing it. The motion to turn down the banquet proposition was so worded that it would let those in favor of the banquet down as easily as possible. It was moved that "it be the sense of the committee that it is inexpedient and premature to hold a banquet at this time, and that fur ther consideration of it be postponed indefinitely." A resolution embodying this idea will be prepared for the public, and an attempt will be made to word it so that it will not offend the Popu lists. The state committee will meet again on January 21 and at that time an offi cial invitation will be extended to the Populists and free silver Republicans to join the Democratic ranks. The meeting will be for the purpose of call ing the Democratic state convention and it will change the basis of repre sentation so as to provide for all the fusion forces. In that connection the Populists and all others opposed to the Republicans will be invited to partici pate in the Democratic primaries. A committee consisting of Frank Thomas of Topeka, treasurer of the committee; George T. Pitts of Welling ton, and John F. Roe of Chanute, was appointed to draft an address to the voters of Kansas setting forth the sen timent of the state committee with re gard to the consolidation of the Popu list and Democratic parties. An attempt will be made to frame It so as to catch the Populists. It was expected that there would be a fight over the question of an official Democratic organ for Kansas. Since the Kansas City Times has been abandoned, the Democrats have had no official organ, but a number of Dem ocrats have endorsed the Kansas City World. The Leavenworth Chronicle Tribune is also a candidate for Demo cratic support. Its editor. R. M. Rug gles, attended the meeting of the com mittee to press the claims of his paper to recognition in case the matter came up. while Richard Collier, managing editor of the Wrorld, and John Curran, its Topeka correspondent, were present to represent the World, but some of the wise ones on the committee sidetracked any action with regard to an official organ, and it was only mentioned in an indirect way. Found Dead in Bed. New York, Dec. 7. Giovanni Besalo and Domenica Farove were found dead in bed in their boarding house today. They had been killed by escaping illu minating, gas. Aurelio Besalo and Giuseppe Tracchea were overcome by the gas and were taken to a hospital In a critical condition. Editors Not Guilty. Chicago, Dec. 7. Judge Dunne dis charged Andrew M. Lawrence and F. H. Canfield, editors of the American, saying they were not guilty of con tempt. Chinese Loan. Paris, Dec. 7. The Chinese loan of 265,000,000 francs at 3 per cent will be issued December 2. 

TALK TCUURY. Attorneys Argue the Hall Mur der Case. Attorney 0. E. Hungate Opens For the State. REVIEWS TESTIMONY. Discusses Variance in Testi mony of Hall and Others. Judge llazen's Instructions Tell How Far Officer May Go. Case Goes to the Jury at Close of Nichols Argument. The arguments in the Hall murder case were begun before Judge Hazen in the district court this morning. The crowd which has been in attend ance upon the trial since it began Wednesday morning was much smaller than on any day previous. The de fendant, Samuel L. Hall, was accom panied to the court room by his wife and children. Mrs. Head, her four children and her sister sat on the other side of the attorneys' table. Several times during the arguments Mrs. Head could not control herself and burst out crying. . ,, The defendant Hall is charged with murder in the first degree, but under the circumstances and the instructions of the court to the jury, if the defend ant is found guilty it will be upon some degree of manslaughter. For murder in the first degree the'sentence is death and for the second degree not less than 21 years in the penitentiary. The de grees of manslaughter are as follows: First degree, not more than 21 years nor less than five years in the peniten tiary. Second degree, not more than five years nor less than three years in the penitentiary. Third degree, not more than three years in the penitentiary nor less than six months in the county jail. Fourth degree, not more than two years in the penitentiary nor less than six months in the county jail. The prosecution hopes to secure a verdict of manslaughter in the first de gree. The defense has made a straight fight on the ground that Hall was jus tified in making the arrest and in using his club, and that the act which re sulted so unfortunately was justifiable, as Head was resisting him and in re sisting struck him, and was in a menac ing attitude when Hall struck him. HUNGATE OPENS FOR STATE. Attorney Otis Hungate, who assisted in the prosecution, opened the argument for the state at 9 o'clock this morning. "The law protects a weak man or a man with a brittle skull just as much as a healthy man," said Mr. Hungate. "It makes no difference wnether the blow was light or heavy, it was fatal in its results. The testimony was brought in here about his being a drinking man and about his addiction to the use of alcohol, carry the impression to you that he was a drunken sot and there fore it was all right for the policeman to kill him. Even if he had been ad dicted to the use of liquor, and if he had become weakened, that dicS not give the policeman the right to finish the job. "I will not argue to you that George Head conducted himself properly at that meeting but it does not appear in the testimony that he was so very boisterous as to stop the meeting. There were people standing close to him who could not understand what he said. Members of the meeting testified that Head did not disturb the meeting to any extent. I want to suggest that while Mr. Hall was a policeman at tempting an arrest does not make any difference in the weighing of testimony as to how the blow was struck, and you should weigh the testimony the same as if the blow had not been struck by an officer." Mr. Hungate reviewed the testimony of witnesses for the state and for the defense. "I think that Hall's own tetslmony shows that he was unjustifiable in striking Head," said Mr. Hungate. "It was no excuse for Hall to club Head even if Head had struck him unless he thought other blows would follow. Hall had no right to strike that blow unless other blows were to follow and now we get down to the question of the posi tion of Head's hands. It does not-seev to me that Hall's testimony in his be half should be taken against the testi mony of eleven uninterested witnesses who testified that Head's hands were open. "It IS claimed by Hall tnat Head made an attack on him and that he had to defend himself. Mrs. Head tes tified that her husband said to her, 'Honest to God, Mattie, this man just beat me," and there is no testimony against it. "Hall claims that Head committed an assault upon him but at the police sta tion he omitted to charge Head with re sisting an officer. That was the.reason he claims the blow was justifiable. Why did he not charge Head with re sistance? Because he could not sub stantiate the charge." Hungate finished his argument at 10 o'clock. JUDGE HAZEN' S INSTRUCTIONS. The following is from Judge Hazen's instructions to the jury: A policeman has authority to make an arrest for the violation of a city or dinance without a warrant when the offense for which the arrest is made is committed in his presence, and making such arrest the officer may use such force as is reasonably necessary to make the arrest, but must not use more force than is reasonably necessary un der the circumstances. A policeman in making an arrest must not inflict un necessary injury by the use of unneces sary force and In making a simple ar rest for the violation of a city ordi nance an officer would not be author ized to use force to the extent of taking life or inflicting reat bodily barm merely to make the arrest. But, if in attempting to make an arrest an officer is attacked and the attack is such as to place him in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, then such officer would have the right to resist such at tack by the use of such force as is rea sonably necessary to repel the attack and protect himself, even to the extent of Inflicting great bodily harm or tak ing life if necessary. A party attacked has a right to act upon conditions as they appear to him at the time, although subsequent events may show that he was mistaken. If then you believe lrom the evidence in this case that the deceased, George W. Head, at the time the alleged injury was inflicted upon him was violating the ordinances of this city by disturb ing a religious gathering of people at or , near the corner of Kansas avenue and Railroad street; that the defendant ar rested the deceased on account of such disturbance, and in making the arrest used only such force as was reasonably necessary, then the defendant would not be liable for the injury that result ed to deceased in making the arrest. Jt is for you to say from all the evldenc3 in this case whether the defendant was warranted in making the arrest; wheth er in making such arrest he used oiuy such force as was reasonably necessary and whether, while attempting to make the arrest the defendant was attacked by the deceased, and if so the manner of the attack and whether the defend ant was Justified in his conduct in re pelling such attack. If you believe from the evidence In this case that the defendant struck the deceased, George V. Head, with his ATTORNEY ENSMINGER In One of His Oratorical Flights. club -in an attempt to place him under arrest, and that the defendant intlicted an injury upon the head of the deceased which caused his death, then it is for you to determine whether the defendant was justified in using his club in the manner and in the extent that he did use it. If you believe that under the circum stances he was justified in using his club, and further believe that the man ner and force with which it was used was not calculated to do great bodily harm upon or to produce the death of the deceased, then the defendant would not be guilty. In determining this question you have a right to take into consideration the situation of the parties and the apparent physical con dition of the deceased as he appeared to the defendant at the time of the transaction. If you believe from the evidence in this case that the deceased, George V. Head, was by his conduct disturbing a religious gathering in this city; that defendant Hall had notified said de ceased to desist from such disturbance, and he failed or refused to do so, and that thereupon the defendant attempt ed to put him under arrest on account of such disturbance, and that the de ceased, George W. Head, resisted ar rest and assumed a threatening atti tude towards the defendant as though he intended to inflict bodily injury upon him, then the defendant -would hnxa the right to repel the attack or appar ent attack by force, and would have the right to use such force as was reasonably necessary to repel the at tack and protect himself from injury. But in so doing the defendant would only be authorized to use such force as was reasonably necessary to protect himself from injury. Where an officer is attacked and the manner of the attack is such as not to put the officer in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, then such officer would not be authorized in re sisting such attack to inflict great bodily injury upon the aggressor, such as would be likely to produce death. ENSMINGER FOR DEFENSE. Attorney J. S. Ensminger opened the argument for the defense at 10 o'clock. "There has been conflicting evidence by the witnesses for the state," said Mr. Ensminger. "Some of the witnesses sai 1 that Hall took hold of Head by the lapel of his coat and others say by the arm and others say he had no coat on. Some say that Hall went to Head once, some say he went to him twice and oth ers say three times and some say that Hall did not go to him at all. I do not mean to imply that these witnesses are prevaricating but it shows how differ ently people will see the same affair and which is right." Mr. Ensminger reviewed the testi mony of Evangelist Osgood who was conducting the meeting and who went to Head and asked him to be quiet and who testified that he saw Hall go to Head and saw Head strike Hall and saw Hall try to parry the blow with his club and strike him and thought Head was about to strike him again. "That is what Mr. Hall testified to and just in the line of what Mr. Osgood testified," said Mr. Ensminger. "Do you believe that Hall intended to do Head great bodily harm. There is not a man here who can put his hand on his heart and say before his God that Hall in tended to administer a severe blow. If Hall had Intended to inflict a severe blow he would have struck differently. I do not say that we were justified in cracking this man's skull but I do wish to show that it was a light blow and not done in a malicious manner. This was all extraordinary. The circumstan ces are unusual as the physicians all testify. It is extraordinary that when the blow was struck he did not even fall to his knees. Are we to be censurable for the fact that this man's vitality was impaired and his powers of resist ance lessened? Hall believed this man was making an attack unon him; he can not be held guilty of this charge. Hall believed he was resisting him. There were only two men in that crowd who knew whether there was re sistance. Those two were Head and Hall. Do you believe that without any provocation that Hall turned round and struck Head? Do they not say that Head was in an attitude of defense? Why? They would say that because Hall was going to strike him. Would Hall strike him for nothing? Something happened there. Was it necessary for Head to hold up his hands and say 'waif? I say it is unreasonable, for if he had wanted to he would have said 'Wait. Hall, I don't want to go to jail.' " Attorney Ensminger then took up the Instructions of the court. He passed quickly over the charges constituting murder in the first or second degree, and said: "I do not think the prosecu tion will insist on murder or that the circumstances would justify your con sideration of what constitutes murder." He then discussed the degrees of man slaughter. "There are laws thrown around an officer," said Mr. Ensminger, "and those laws give him authority. Mr. Hall went to Head in the pursu ance of duty and not to commit a crime, so he could not have committed manslaughter in the first degree. Hall did not go to Head in the heat of pas sion, and none testified that Hall was (Continued on Sixth Paee.) SANTA FE AFTER STEAMER LINE. An Agent in Europe Engaged In Negotiations For a Line of Vessels Across the Atlantic. INTERESTS INVOLVED Include the Pennsylvania Hail' road Company Property And the Hamburg Amerlcau Steamship Company. New York, Dec. 7. Emil L. Boas. local agent of the Hamburg-American Steamship line, is in Germany confer ring with the high officials of the com- pany concerning the operation of tha ocean line in conjunction with an American railroad, says the Tribune. Mr. Boas went abroad a few weeks ago) and it was then said that American capitalists through "Dummies" ii Vienna were seeking to get control oC the German Steamship company, anl that Mr. Boas had been hurriedly calleil to the main office at Hamburg to ex plain, if possible, what the combination of the Atlantic Transport and Leyland, lines really meant. It is said in shipping circles that it would be impossible for Americans to secure control of the Ham burg-American line, the capitalization of which is about $80,000,000, and that Mr. Boas mission abroad was to lay before tha Hamburg-American company plan and arrangements for a deal with tha Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad. It was announced some time ago that negotiations were In progress looking to the establishment by the Hamburg American Steamship company of a lina on the Pacific, to be operated In connec tion with the Atchison road, but those negotiations yielded no result. The re port now is that the Pennsylvania rail road, which has close relations with tha International Navigation company op erating the American and Red Star Steamship companies, is to be associ ated with the Atchison in any arrange ment which may be made with the Hamburg-American line, thus forming a thorough route from Europe to tha Orient by way of the United States. That report, however, could not be con firmed in this city. Mr. Meyer, who Is Mr. Boas' assist ant in the New Tork ugency nf the Hamburg-American line, said the di rectors of the line were considering some sort of an arrangement with the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad, but that he was not In a position to explain the details of the proposition. ON ITS MERITS. Why a Certain Drug Store Appeals to the People. Mr. O. A. Keene, a druggist at No. 803 Kansas avenue, Just south of tha transfer station, is slowly but surely building up a good drug business in Topeka and one of which he is Justly proud. He is now carrying a larger anil better stock than ever before. It is gratifying to the public to see a young man like Mr. Keene go ahead. One big thing in his favor, of course, is tha fact that he has one of the best loca tions in the city. "A strong point with me," says Mr. Keene, "is that I tolerate no loafers and by no means do I depend upon the; usual drinking crowd which is so often found at drug stores; some of them re lying on that class of trade for sup port. "I not only carry the usual stock of drugs, etc., but handle candies and things of that kind in connection with my drug business besides controlling a splendid newspaper and magazine trade. I think it can be said without being boastful that hulies can enter my store with as much safety from loafers and the class of fellows who hang" around just to drink as they can tha average store in Topeka. At least that is the way I try to keep It and so far as that is concerned the large number of lady patrons this store has speaks for itself." DEWEY DENIES IT.
