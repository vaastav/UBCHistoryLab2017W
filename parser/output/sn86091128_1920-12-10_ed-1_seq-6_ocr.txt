LAST MESSAGE BT HE WAS UNABLE TO APPEAR BEFORE CONGRESS IN PERSON. SUG6ESTS LOAN TO ARMENIA President Addresses Annual Message to Congress—Asks Food Laws— He Did Not Appear in Person. WASHINGTON—Presiedut Wilson's concrete recommendations to con gress in his annual message Tuesday were: Revision of tlie tax law with simplification of the income and profits taxes. Independence for the Philip pines. A loan to Armenia. < Economy in government ap propriations and expenditures and creation of a workable budget system. Cold storage and other laws affecting the cost of living, and the federal licensing of corpora tions as recommended in pre vious messages. Rehabilitation and training of disabled soldiers and sailors. The president did not indorse a bonus. Nowhere did the president re fer to tlie League of Nations or the peace treaty fight, except perhaps by inference in his open ing when he quoted Abraham Lincoln's "Let us have faith that right makes right, and that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it." At its close the president wrote a paragraph which might be regarded as a valedictory, saying: "I have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred and which is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I be lieve this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in tlie days to come, whether in America or elsewhere.'! Democracy, the president said, "is being put upon its final test." Old World Rejects It. "The old world," said he, "is suf fering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a sub stitutinu of the principle of autoc racy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude.' This Is the time of all others when democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead ill the attempt to make this spirit prevail." Two ways States can assist to accomplish this groat object" were outlined by the president. They were: "First—By offering the example within her own borders of the will and (lower of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestion ably just and which are equal to their administration. "Second—By standing for right and justice as towards individual na tions." "The United States,' said the presi dent, "can not refuse this role of champion without putting tlie stigma of rejection upon tlie great and the devoted men who brought it into existence." The president's message was trans mitted by messenger, the president adhering to his decision not to ad dress congress in person. which the United "ill He Worried Father. Key C. McDowell of Butte, Mont., applied for enlistment at the army recruiting station recently. As it was necessary to verify his age, his father was communicated with.

You should make a damn good soldier, if you are able to worry the enemy «hen you meet him anything like you have worried tne, great credit will ,be yours." World Produces Less Gold.
