It I a much the duty ot the Government to render prompt juitioe ecalmt Itself in favor of citizens, a it U to admlciiter tbe same between private Individ oala. Tbe inrestlgatloa and adjudication of ' all tlaims, In their nature, belong to the Judicial Department, beside it i apparent thai the atteotioa ot Coorrecs will be more than usually engaged for some tims to come, with great national question. It wa Intended bv the organization of tbe Court of Claims mainlv to remove this branch of buiineas from tbe ball of Congrese ; but while th court ha proved an effectivs and valuable moan of In vestigation, it in a great degree fail to effect the object of It creation, for want ot power to make it judgment final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to lay danger, or tbe subject, 1 commend to your careful consideration whether tbi power of making judgment final may not properly be given to tbe court, with such other provisions as eiperienee may have shown to be neceeiary. " I ask attention to lbs report of tbe Poetmas-er-General, the following being a summary statement of the condition of the Department: Tbe revenue from all source during th fiscal - year ending on tbe 3Utb of June, lobi, includ ing tha annual permanent appropriation ol $7,010,000 for the transportation ol free mall matter, wa $9,049,296.40, being about two per Osir. less than the reeeoueof I860; thejexpeodi tore were $13,606,709.11, chowlog a decrease of more than eight per cent, as compared with those of the previous year, and leav log an excess of expenditures over tbe reve nue for the last Asml veer of over $557,462.71. Theerou revenue for the year ending June 30, 1663, id estimated at an iucrease of tour per cent on that of. IbGl, making $8,683,000, to which should be added the earnings of tbe De partment for carrying free matter, vi.t $700,000, making $9,382,000. Tbe total expenditure for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,345,000 to be sup plied from tbe Treasury, in addition to tbe per manent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I tblnk, that the extension ot this District across tbe Poto ' mac river at the time of establishing theap tial here, was eminently wise, and consequent ly tbe relecqulbbment of that portion of it wblcb lies in the State of Virginia was unwieo and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the xoedieocv of .reeainiue that part of the Die - bint, init rh raatora'tlon of the orteihal hound- arie thereof, through negotiation with the State Ol Virginia. - - Tha renort ol tbe Secretary of tbe Interior, With the accompanying documents, exhibit the' eondltition of tbe several branches or trie pur lic business pertaining to that department. Tbe depressing inlluencea of the insurrection have been especially icis in me operation! oi the patent and general land offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the last year have exceeded tbe expenses of our land system only aoout i-flw.uuu. i ne sue have been entirely impended in "the Southern States, while the interruptions to tbe business of tbe country and the diversion ol large num ber of men from labor to militiry service, hare obstructed settlements in the new States . and territories of the Northwest. The receipts of the Patent office have declined in nine months about $100,000, rendering a large re duciion of th force employed necessary to make it self sustaining. - Tbe demands upon the Pension office will be lareelv increased by the insurrection. Numer ous applications for pensions, based upon th casualties of t be existing war, nave already been made. : There is every reason to be lieve that many who are now upon the pen' sion roll and in receipt of the bounty of th Government, are In the ranks of tha in- enrcent army, or riving them aid and comfort, The Secretary of the Interior has directed the suspension of payment of the pensions of such persons, upon proof of their disloyalty. I rec ommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause th name of such persons to be stricken from the pension roll. ' . 1 Th relations of tbe Government with the In dian tribes have been lately disturbed by the In anrr!tinn. and eaceclallv in the southern inner intendency and in tost of New Mexico The Indian country south of Kansas is in possession of insurgents' from Texas ana Ananias. Tha agent ot th United States appointed since the 4th of March, for this superintendenoy, hay been unable to reach their postx, while the most of those who were In offioe before that time have espoused th Insurrectionary caase, and assumed to exercise'the power of agent by virtue of commissions from th insurrection 1st. " It ha been stated in - th public press that a portion of thee Indians have been ' organized as a military force, and ar attached . to tha army of tbe insurgents. - Although the Govern meet ha no official Information upon th subject, letter have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affair by several prominent Chiefs, giving assurance of tbeir loyalty to th United States, and expressing the wish for the presence ot the Federal troops, tnnrotectthem. - It i believed that on th re possession of tho country by tbe Federal troops th Indians will readily cease sll hostile dem onstrations and resnmo their former relations aa tha Government. ' . Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a department or a bu reau, but a clerkship only, assigned to It in the Government.' Wbtl it is fortunate mat ton great Interest is so independent In Its nature as not to nave oemanaea ana extortea more irom $h Government, I respectfully ask Congress to insider whether something more oannot be glv 91 Tolnntarily with general advantage Annn I report exhibiting the condition of our Agri cultural commerce and manufacture would pro sent a fund I information of great praotlcal vain to th country. While 1 make no sug gestion a to details, I ventore th opinion that an Agricultural and Statistical Bureau mtftht profitably be organized. " '. The execution of the law for tha suppres sion of th African slav trad ha been con fined t th department of th Interior. ' It Is a subject of congratulation that th efforts which have been made for the suppression of this in ' human traffic, hav recently been attended with uuniual success? Five vessel being fitted out for th slave trad hav been seized and condemned. Two matter engaged In the trade, and ou pr0tt eqaiping th vessel as a slaver, have bees oonvtouid and subjected to th penalty offioe and imprisonment, and on captain, taking a erga of Africans an board bis vessel has been eonvioted ol the highest grad of of fem under - our law, the 'punishment of which Is death. " "" ' Tbe Territories of Colorado, Dakotab, and Nevada, ereated by th last Congress, have been organized,' and civil administration bas been Inaugurated therein tinder auspice espe cially gratifying, When It Is considered that tho leaven of treason was found existing in some of those new countries when th federal omcers arrived there. The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with lb security ol pro tection afforded by an organized government, will doubtless iuvit to them a large Immigra tion when peace hall restore ths business of th country to its accustomed channel - .

I commend their interests aud doleua to th enlightened and gnrou care oi yon. I re'oonimend to the favorable consideration at CnnirraM the latere: ol th District of Co- lnmhla. The insurrection has bsen the cause nr mnoh anffarine and sacrifice to the Inhabl toots, and as tbey have no representative In Congress, that body should not overlook their just claims upon tne uovernmeut- At vonr lata session a oint reioiutiun w adontad authorizing the President to tak maaauraa far fecllitatinr a nrotier representa tion of the Industrial Interests oi the United States at tha exhibition of tb industry of all nations, to ba held at London In tbe year leo I regret to have been unable to give personal attention to th subject, a subject at one so interestiniT In Itself and so extensively and in timately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of the State and Interior a plan or svstem haa been devised and partly matured which will be laid befor yon. Under and by virtue ol u act oi oougren entitled "an act to confiscate property ued for insurrectionary purposes" approved August bth, 18C1, legal olaimsof certain persons to the labor and seivice of certain other person have become forfeited, and number of th latter tho liberated ar already dependant on tbe United States, and must be provided lor in som way. Beddes this , it is not impossiois that some of tbe State will nass similar enact menta for tcir own benefit, respectively, ana by the operation ol which persons of tb sams class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accenting such persons from sucb States ao cordiug to some mode of valuation in lien fro rear ol direct taxes, or upon some omer pan to be sgreed on with such Statee respectively; that lucb persons- on sucb acceptance by Ihe ueneral Government ne at once aeemea tree; and that In any event steps be taken for colo nising both classes, or the one first mentioned, if the other shall not be brought into existence, at tome place or place in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already In the United State could not. so far as individuals may desire, be Included In uch colonisation To carry out the plan ol colonization may involve the acquiring ol territory, and also ths appropriation of money beyond that expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the acquisition ot territory for nearly 60 years, tbe Question of constitutional power to do so Is no longer an open one with ns. The power was first questioned by Mr. Jtnersoo.wno, nowever, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded nis ecru plea, on tbe plea of great expediency. If, it be said that tbe only legitimate object or acquir ing territory is to furnish homes for while men, this measure effects that object, for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining: or coming here. Mr. Jaffaraon. however, nlaccd the impor tance or procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population. Un this wnole proposition, in cluding tb appropriation of money, with the acquisition ol territory, does not tbe expediency amount to absolute necessity, without which the Government cannot be perpetual T ' In considering toe policy to D adopted tor suppressing the insurrection,! have been anxious ind careful that tbe inevitable conflict for toil purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every ease thought It proper to keep the Integrity of tbe Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military Importance to tbe more Jeliberat ao tton of tho legislature. In tbe exercise of my best discretion I nave adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proa limation, tbe law of Congress enacted at tb late session lor closing loose ports, also obey ing the dictates of prudence ae well aa th ob ligation of law; Instead of transcending, I hav adhered to tbe act of Congress to coufls- eate property used lor insurrectionary purposes, If a new law upon .the same subject shall be proposed. It propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all dispensable means must be employed. We should not be In haste to determine what radical and extreme measures, which may reach tbe loyal as well is the disloyal, arc indispensable.- " Tbe inaugural address at tbe beginning of the Adminfstrtiaon, and the message to Con gress at tbe late special session, were botb mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out or which tbe insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add to or substract from tbe principles or general pur posee stated and explained In those documents. Tbe last ray or bope lor preserving tne union peaceably expired at tne assault upon t ort Bum ter, and a general review or wbat nas occurred since may be profitable. What waa. painfully uncertain tnen, is mncn oeuer oennea ana more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The Insurgents confidently claimed a strong support Irom north ol Mason and Dixon' line, and the friend of the Union were not fie from apprehension on this point. This, however, wss toon settled definitely, and on tbe right side. ' South of tbe line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was mad to seem againat the Union. Our soldiers ware assaul ted, bridges were burned and railroads torn np within her limits, and we were many days at one time without tbe ability to bring a single regiment over ber soil to tne Capitol, now ber bridges and railroads are repaired and opened to tbe Government, She already give seven regiments to th cans of th Union, and con to tb enemy; and net people at a regular eiec lion have sustained th Union by a large major ity and-a larger aggregate vote than tbey ever beiore gave to any candidate or any Question Kentucky, too. lor some time in doom, is now decidedly, and, I tbink.nncbangably rang ed on the side of the Union. Missouri is com parat'.veiy qoiet, and, I believe, cannot again be overrun by tbe insurgents. .These three 8tate of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, neither ol which wonld promise a single sol dier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in tne neia lor tne union wniie or tneir citizens not more man a tuiro in number are among the insurgents, and they oi doubtful whereabout and existence. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on tbe Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country. An insurgent force or about fifteen hundred for months dominating the narrow peninaular region constituting tbe counties ol Accomae and Northampton, and known-as Ihe Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous part of Maryland, hav laid down tneir arms, and nie people mere nave renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of tbe old flag. Tbi leave no armed iniur rection north oi the Potomae or east of tbe Chesapeake. Also we have obtained a rooting at each of the isolated points on the Southern coast ol Hatteras. Port Royal, Tybee Island near Sa vannah, and Ship Island, and we likewise bave tome general accounts of popular movements n behalf of tbe union in norm varouna ana Tenneesee. These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union i advancing steadily south ' Since vour last adjournment, Lieutenant uen eral Scott nas retired irom toe neaa oi tue ar nr. During his lone life the nation has not been unmindful of hi mrit, yet en calling to mind how faithful v. ably and brilliantly be ba served tb country Irom a time tar oaca in our hiirtorv. when few of tbe now living bad been born, and thence forward continually.I cannot but tblnk that we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for your considestion what farther mark of recognition is an to mm ana our selves as a grateful people. ' -" With tbe retirement of Gen. Scott came the executive duty of appointing in his stead it Gen-eral-lu Chief of ths army. It Is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor couutry was tbere. so far a I know, any difference of opinion ae to tbe proper person to be selected. The retiring Chief repeatedly expressed bis iudement in favor of Gen. McLleilan tor tbe po sition, and in thil the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. The designation of General MoClcllan , Is therefor In a considerable degree the sUootlon of the country as well as of the Eicoutlve, and henoe tbere is better reason to bope there will be giv en blm the ooufldeno and cordial support thus by fair Implication promised, - and without which h cannot with so much .eCttolenoy serve tbe country..

In a storm at sea no one on board can wish Ihe ship to sink , and yet not nnfrequently all go down together, be cause too many will direct, and no slngl mind oan b allowed to control. It continue to de velope that the insurrection is largely, if not .exclusive!?. war noon the first principle of popular Government, the rights of tb people Conclusive evidence or tuts is louna in in most grsv and maturely considered publlo document as. well as In the general tone of tha insurgents. In tbeae document w find the abridgment of the-existing right of unrag, and tb denial to tb people or an to participate la ihe eeleolloa of pubito omcers, excent th leelslativ bodv. advocated with la bored argument to prov that larg control of tb Government la tb people is tne source oi all polltioal evil. Monarchy lueir is some times hinted at aa a possible refuge from the power of tbe people. . In my present position I oould scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against wis appro acn or returning uespouim. It ia not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made In favor of popular Insiitutloos.-bot there is one point with its con nections not to hackneyed as other, to which I ask a brisf attention. It 1 th effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above labor. In tbe structure of tbe Government. It U aaanmad that labor is available onl? in con nection with os pita! j that nobody labors unless somebody else, owner or capital somcnow, vj tha nsa af it induce him (to labor- This as sumed, it is nsxt considered whether it Is best that capital shall hire laborer, and tnu muuoe them to woik by their own consent, or buy tbem and drive them to it without their con sent. Having proceeded so far. it Is naturally coo eluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or wbat we call slave; and further, It Is assum ed that whoever Is once a hired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life. Now, there Is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a freeman being fixed for Ufa in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these assumptions are false, and all infer encea from them are groundless.' Labor Is Kior to independent capital. Capital is on the' fruit of labor, -and never could have existed if labor bad not first existed. Labor is Ihe superior of capital and deserve much th higher consideration. Capital ha its rights, which are as worthy of pro tection as any other rights. Nor Is It deem ed that there is and probably always will be a relation between labor and capital pro ducing mutual benefit. Th error 1 in assum ing that tb whole labor of community exist within that relation.- AJfew men own capital and that lew avoid labor, and with tbeir capital hlr or buy a few to labor for tbem A large majority belong to neuner ciasi neiioer won lor others nor bave other working for tbem. Ia most of tbe Sonteern States a majority of tbe whole peoale of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in tbe Northern a larg ma jority ar neither hirers nor hired men, with tfieir families, wives, eons ana aaugoters, won lor themselves on tbeir farms, in tbeir houses and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves and asking no lavors oi cipitai on tbe one band nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It .il not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingling their own labor with capi-1 tal, that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy tr hlr other to labor lor tnem, out this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Again, as ba alreadv been said, tbere is not of necessity any inch thing aa tbe free hired laborer, being fixed tor mat conainon tor nie. Many independent men every w tier e 10 tnese States, a few years back In their lives, were bircd. laborer. -Tbe prudent, penniless beg gar In the world, labors for wages a while, and saves a surplus wiin wmcn to ouy toon or una lor himself j then labors on bis own accceunt, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosper ous system, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent energy, progress and improvementof the condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toll up or on . from poverty, none less inclined to take or touch ought which tbey have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which thev already possess, and which, if sur rendered, will snrely be used to close the door of advancement against such-ae they and to fix new disabilities and burdw upon them till all of liberty shall be lost. .From tbe first taking oi our national census to tne last ar seventy Vears, and we find our population at tb end of thi period eight time aa great as it was at the beginning. ' The inorease ol those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater. We bave at one view wbat the popular principle applied to Govern ment tbrougn the machinery of the State and the Union haa produced In a given time, and also what If firmly maintain ed It promises for tbe coming - future. .There ar already among us those who, If the Union be preserved, will live to see it contain 250,000,000. The struggle of to-day 1 not al together for to-day, it i for a vast future also. With a firm reliance on Providence, all th more firm and earnest, let ns proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon
