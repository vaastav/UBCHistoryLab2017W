Grant has done us a small service unintentionally. The thing he ought to have done is to confess his error in recogniling the Kellogg govern ment and announce to Congress that he would recognize it no longer, He has shewn himself incapable of this straightforward conduct, and the next best thing was for him to make a fool of himself, and exhibit what a muddle he is in yet over the Louisiana case, notwithstanding he has had so much time to inform him self. No one ever pretended that Kel 'ogg was elected by a majority of bal lots. Mr. Morton admitted that a majority of the votes actually cast was against Kellogg, but he, and all the adherents of the Usurper have hitherto justified the President's re cognition of him on the assumption that he would have received a major ity of ballots had every one voted for him that wanted to. But Grant did not use the same argument in his own justification. He chose a differ ent ground, selected by his legal ad viser, Landaulet Williams, which was that in installing Kellogg, he was merely enforcing the decrees of the U. S. Couit (Durell's midnight order) and in continuing to recognize him, he was only following the recognition by the highest State Court. Both these props were knocked from under him in the Senate dis cussion last winter. Morton an nounced Durell's order as illegal, and hence the President's enforcement of an illegal order was itself illegal and wrong. Carpenter proved that the Supreme Court's decision was of no validity so far as it affirmed the le gitimacy of the Kellogg government, because that question was not before the Court. Landaulet had to shift his ground, and so in his subsequent conversations with Grant, he has ta ken a new departure and instilled in his mind the idea that Kellogg re ceived a majority of legal votes ac tually cast, and Grant, who does not think of public business longer than ,le is talked to about it, imagines that is the reason he always gave for his official action and thus repeats it in his message: "On account of the frauds and forgeries committed at that election, and because it appears that the returns thereof were nev er legally canvassed, it ,was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen, but from the best sources of information at my com mand, I have always believed the present State officers received a majority of the legal votes actually east at that election." The frauds and forgeries so mixed and confused the matter that there could be no certainty-the returns, such as they were, were never legally canvassed-and these two things make it impossible to tell who was chosen, but nevertheless he believes Kellogg was chosen. Even the Lynch Board never pretended that they had the ballots, legal or illegal to count. With all this lying ef frontery they could only venture to count Kellogg in by substituting af fidavite for ballots, but the President is so unconscious of the exalted place he fills that he conceives such asen tence as the above fit to be inserted in a State paper. SIftanything more were needed to .askethe President's message ridic uloys, he has taken care to furnish it in the crude observations on finance with which.he opens it, but what ar. tistic polish there is in such senten ceana these, '"Yiolence has been.ram: pa~, in some localities." "While I sayarn esxecutive all the laws of Con gress will be enforced." Iastly what db our gentlemen of eolor, who are shocked at our using t~h general term.negro, say to Massa Gr't who thus. mentionis them; "Under existing circumstances th4 negro votes the Republican ticket, beeause he kndws his friends are of that party," and much more of the same sort that will distinguishIthis Meuagl g from all othcre· that have pleehded it by its- coarseness of dic t~o'said abserece of a single states nmtike: thought, or even sound politialt suggestion.

BOAT SuNK--The Boa sie;, Chptain Boardman, while de scending ovier the Upper Falls, took a shearon the pilot, struck one of the rodk-s ad~ the shaft of the sunken R. W. Adams, and in a few miputes sank :barely over her guards. She had on board a cargo of 800 bales of cotton, 250 of which were thrown overboard in double quick time to s_e the boat from..breaking in two; many bales of the cotton floated down here,.and were saved in a big barsry and with energy by many of our people. The cotton is held here for salvage, and many and varied are the discussions we have heard of the probable amount of money the "wreckers" will divide among them seLves. .The boat is supposed not to be a total loss, and efforts are being made to raise her. g~FThe cargo of the Sabine, when she sunk, consisted of 615 bales of cotton, 135 hogsheads of sugar, 251 barrels of molasses, 30 sacks of cotton seed, 61 sacks of seed cotton and one barrel of sugar. RAPIDES IN RETURNING BOARD. Our turn has come in the turning board as the darkies not inaptly call it. .The Board have taken up the re turns from this Parish and the-N. O. Republican thus introduces us "This is another of those parishes in the Northern part of the State where the voi~e of Republicans has been stifled by tht reigir of terror inaugurated by the White League in the early part of last summer and kept up until after the election." Does the Republican pervert the truth wilfully or from ignorance of the actual facts? There is not now, and there was not last summer, nor has there ever been a White League in this parish. There has not been and there is not now any man or body of men in Rapides organized in a White League. The only pretext for such a blunder as the Republican's statement (if it is not a deliberate and intentional falsehood) is that at the Mass Meeting held here to inau gurate the late political campaign, it was determined to call the party the "White Man's Party," and so it was called by those who liked that name better than the old one of Conserva tive Democracy. But the Republi can is not content with one misrep resentation. In the next line it says, "Rapides in a free and fair election.un der our present law of suffrage, has repeat edly gone Republican by majorities ran ging from 1200 to 1500." When did it ever give that major ity at any election for the Republi cans? The organ has got this mixed up with the affidavits of Lott and Kelso in Durell's Court to the effect that 1500 Republicans were prevent ed voting here in '72, the perjury be ing manifest from the fact that that number added tq the vote actually cast very far exceeded not only the registered votes but all the males in the Parish over twenty-one years old The official organ of the Republi can Party at New Orleans has notice ably stiffened its backbone. Its is sue of the 6th was bolder and more defiant than of late and since then it has repeated its threat-"let them undertake to set aside the decision of the Returning Board, and they will probably begin to bring down upon their heads some such hail storm as they saw in 1861." To all which we answer, that we will set aside the decision of that Board if it is contrary to the already ascertained result. No power-not even the hail storm of 1861-can compel us to submit to a Govern ment, either State or Parochial, that has not for its sanction, the consent of the governed. We submitted in '72. Once is enough. Let our friends in New Orleans be of good cheer. 1lr. Wlltz and the Speakership. Our neighbor the Caucasian don't mean either injustice or unkindness to ex-Mayor Wiltz, but it has done both. It "don't bring any charge of dishonesty, or incompeteuce against him." Our creole friend ought to be very grateful for that. Considering that Mr. Wiltz's personal character is above reproach, he gains much by this abstinence of our neighbor.- The Caucasian confesks that it "don't know him," and it might with equal frankness have confessed it did not know the facts of his candidacy for re-election to the Mayoralty of New Orleans. Mr. Wiltz was nominated for re election, When .the .count disclosed that he was nominated by one vote, there was a clamor that the count was wrong and the Secretary was or dered to count .again, but, pending this three persons changed their votes from Wiltz to Leeds, apd the latter was declared' the nominee. Mr. Wiltz's friends insisted that otes could not he changed after a count had been made and the result proclaimed, and they declared their purpose to insist on his candidacy.- There was imminent danger of a split. Mr. Wiltz nobly came.forward and declared there should be no di4 4iision. He refused to have his name uised-refused to discuss whether he was beaten by jugglery or Leeds was fahrly nominated.' . He compelled his partisans to support Leeds. The people of New Orleans were so im pressel by the magnainiity bf MIr. Wiltz, that tihey soghti some way of e'xhibiting it. The hiominations for. the Legislature had been made, but one of the candidates withdrew for t~he express'purpose of having Wiltz t'ake his place, and sinice'ris election lie has been everywhere marked as t~he probable Speaker. Theire is lit tile doult that he will bIe chosen, and we say this, endorsing every word of tIhe piraise given by the Caucasian to the one of our Representatives men tioned for 'the same honor. Sr In the report of.the Inspec tor General of the Army he comes out hot and heavy against soldiers, marrying without permission, fakes strong grounds againestthe "boys in blue" having wives, even laundress es; states that it is well known that it takes as much transportation for four laundresseos as it does to move a whole company, and winds up by stating that a soldier can be detailed to do the washing just as well as the laundrcdks. THE RET RtIINI BOARD.'Yx The Board is shewing its 'hnd now po plainly, that, the weak yessls that have us i ao r, d .d: airi[ess: from it itegiiu to1o i. Deoto was rejected.-that ~ the latest news.•:  don't matter 'what wps the reason as~ signed. One is as good as another. We have proclaimed to the public from the beginning that' Board in which the leading spirits are Mat Wells and Keno Anderson cannot do right, and it is no use to expect or look for it. Rapides knows both of these worthies. Wells was born and raised lere and hasi been after sonie villainy ever since he left-his cradle. Anderson lived here some time and one night was caught-well ask him how he got nicknamed Keno. To suppose that the people of Lou isiana will submit to this jugglery is to accuse them of the most arrant cowardice. We know that the radi cals were beaten *at the polls last month, and the figures have been so often published that the whole coun try knows it too, and all newspaper dom north and south have been watching the Returning Board, and noting its suspicious acts. That is the difference between now and '72. Then our countrymen were not con vinced that we had carried the elec tion. Now they know it as well as we do, and our determination not to be cheated out of our victory will be ap plauded by them. For Rapides we can speak. The Radical candidates here admit they were fairly beaten, and disclaim any purpose of filling or attempting to fill the offices. But if any one of them shall change his mind and try, his hand oh our people, his punish ment will come so swift and sure that a lightning flash won't be a cir cumstance to it. We elected our men fairly, and no foul play of the Returning Board shall reverse the people's verdict. P Prepaired Mince Meat for Christmas Pies, at Julius Levin's, Fightig at Vicksbarg. The columns of the Democrat have more than once startled with the cap tion of this article, but that was du ring the late'serious unpleasantness, and now in peace times a la radical, we again fall back on it. Our peopled of Mississippi, like we of Louisiana, have seen fits at the hands of the same saviours, and are now going through a 14th of September emuete in which they'are ocourse victorious. ý The story is a short one and is soon told.

A recent disgraceful scene fin the Court House at Colfax, Grant Parish, foroibly reiinds us thLa the ~ads don't always hit the truth on the head or make good excuses for their misdeeds.
