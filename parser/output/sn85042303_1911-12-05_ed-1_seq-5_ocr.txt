RIGHT V. D. Ileecher, who has been the lament fcr the United States express company at this place for the past to years, has received a promo lion and will leave today to take the office of agent nt Muskogee. When the United States express company decided to enter the local Held they chose as their agent Mr. lieecher, who has risen by reason of merit in the employ of the company as their agent here, and they could not have made a happier selection, j Mr. Beecher immediately began mak ing friends and the business of the ompany h&s gradually increased nn-ii'-r his management. Mr. Mertz has been assigned to succeed Mr. lieecher here. The iransfer was made by If. M. Payton, traveling auditor of the company, v. ho Is also interested in )tner ert- erprises In Ardmore. Mr. and Mrs. Iteecher will be great ly missed by the large circle of 'fiends that they have acquired sine; toming to Ardmore. Our Religion. We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make r.s love one another. Dean Swltt. There is a minor afloat that, a pe tition will bo circulated in the city within a few days, asking that th" present form of cily government bo abolished and that the old, or alder manlc form, ho restored in place of tho commission form of government that wo have at present. Tho old charter, under which wo lived previous to adopting the com mission form of government is dead, and the only way that the 'present, form could ' he changed back would bo to amend tho present charter along the lines of the geueral statute. Should Ardmore make this move it would get more advertising than any city In the United ' States, as it was one of the first to adopt the commis sion form of government and would be the very first to reject it, , , ;This .would make every office in the city an. elective one, with the exception of the policemen and fire men. Just, how tills wijl be received by the citizens - is problematical, but it will no doubt precipitate a warm light. . -t Benevolent Work.
