The President Says We Are Only Righting Wrong In Restoring Hawaii's Oueen The Tariff is the last, Bat Not the Least Important, Blatter Discussed It Is Too Soon Yet to Say What Financial Leg islation Shall Follow the Repeal of the Silver Purchase Clause of the Sherman Law Departmental Reports Discussed We must Be Economical In Our Expend itures Honey Wasted In Giving Away Seeds Liberia Must Not lie Bullied Many Facts and Figures. Washington, Dec. 4 The following is Vbe message of the President as read in both Houses of Congress to d3j: To the Congress of this United States: The constitutional daty which requires the President, from time to tirn3, to give to the Congress information of the state oi the Union and recommend such meas ures as he shall j idga necessary and ex pedient is fittingly entered upon by com mending to the Congress a carefal exam ination of the detailed statement and well supported recommendations con tained in the reports of the heads of departments who are chiefly charged trith the executive work of the govern taent. In an effort to abridgethis com munication as much as is consistent with its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these departmental repoits by the mention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. While our foreign relations have not at all timts dur ing the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation re mains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and ioye of justice, which, joined with ccn.is eLt firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor haviEg accepted the office of arbitrator of the long standing missions beyond any dispute tendered to the President by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys, commis sioned by those (States to lay before me evidenca and agreements in behalf of their respective governments. THE 

BRAZILIAN REVOLUTION. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of cur new navy are now, and for pome time have been, stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle beiDg bttwtea the established government, wnich control the machinery of administration and with which we maintain friendly rela tions, and certain r rflcers of the navy, employing the vessels i f tLeir command for attack upon the national capUul aud chief seaport, and lucking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, 1 have failed to nee that the insurgents cau reasonably cliim recognition as belliger ents Thus far the position of our gov ernment h-iS bjen that of an attentive but impiriidl observer of the uafortunate conflict Emphasizing our fixed policy of impartial neutrality in each a condi tion of affairs as now exists, I deemed it necessary to disavow, in a manner not t be misunderstood, the unaathor zid ac tion of cur late naval commander in these waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being indisposed to countenance an acs calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrtc tion. TH3 CONVENTION BETWEEN OUR GOV ERNMENT AND CHILI having for iti object the settlement and adjustment of the demands of the tvo countries against eac'a other, haB been made effective by the organization of the clams commission provided for. The two governments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the President of the Swiss republic were iuvokdd, as rovided in the treaty, atd the se ection of the Swiss representative in this country to complete the or ganization was gratifying alike to the United fctates and Chili. The vexatiouB questi n of the so-called legation asylum for offenders against the S.ate and its laws was presented anew in Chili by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving into his official residence two persons who had Just tailed in an attempt at revolution, and against wnom crimiual charge were pending, growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum, as applied to this c-ise, is not sanctioned by the best precedent, and", when allowed, tends to encourage se dition and strife. Under no circum stances can the representatives cf this government be permitted, under the ill defined fiction of extra-territoriality, to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilian government for the corrtction of this conduct in the in stance mectioned, the minister wa3 in ttructed no logger to harbor the of fenders. THE 

GEARY LAW. The legislation of Hst year, known as the Geary law, requiring the rtgutration of all Chinese laborers entitled to resi dence in the United Srares, and the de portation of all net complying with the provisions of the act within the time pre scribed, mat with much opposition from Chinamen in the United States Acting upon the advicj of eminent counsel thtt the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of i 'hineae laborers, pending judi cial inquiry as to i;s validity, in g od f ath declined to apply for the certificates required by its provision. A teit case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before the Supreme Court, and on May 15, 1S93, a deci.-ion was made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed that under the recent amend-' ment of the act extending the time for registration of the Chinese laborers there to entitled, those who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of establishing by lawful pr. cedure their right to remain, aud that thereby the ce-, cessity of enforced deportation may to a great degree be avoided. MURDERS OF SWEDISH MISSIONARIES IN CHINA. It has devolved upon the United States minister at Peking, as dean of the diplo matic body, and in the absence of a rep resentative of Sweden and Norway, to press upon the Chinese government rep aration for the recent murder of Swedish missionaries at Sung Pu. This question is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the interior. FOREIGN RELATIONS EXHAUSTIVELY TREATED. The President deals very exhaustively with cur foreign relations. He notes the f act that by article 12 cf the general act of Brussels, signed July 2d, 1890, the United States and other powers agreed to suppress the elavc trade and prohibit the sale i f arms and intoxicants to the in habitants of the Congo Free State and nther Certral African States. Costa Rica has shown a friendly Epirit in de liverirg np a noted criminal from justice, and the President has sigcified his desire to see arbitration employed in 6tttling the dispute in boundary between that country and Colombia. Our relations with France and Germany and Kngland are cordial, 'f be decision of the Behring Sea tribunal will be strictly obeyed with both England and the United States. The dispute with Great Britaio. by reas on of discriminating tolls imposed in the Weliand Casal upon cargoes of cereals going to and from the lake ports has been adjusted agreeably to both sides. Hayti paid an indemnity for unjustly imprison ing an American citizen. Honduras has apologi zed for firing upon an American mercant vessel for refusing to unlawfully deliver up a pa6scngpr, and the sacce country desires to make reparation for il legally seizing for servica American ves sels. The President goes on: 

HANDS OFF LIBERIA. A notable pait of tho southeasterly coa6t of Liberia, between the Cavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally recog mzsd as belonging to that republic by cession and purchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered into by the native tribes over whom Liberia's con trol has not been well maintained. More recently negotiations between the Libe rian representative and the French gov ernment resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty, whereby, as an adjustment, certain Liberian territory is ceded to France. This convection, at last advices, had not been ratified by the Liberian Legislature and Executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of the little commonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which constitutes the only independently sovereign State on the west coast of Africa, this govern ment has suggested to the French govern ment its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her unrestrained consent. The work -of re-lccating the monu ments marking the boundary between the United States and Mexico from Paso del Norte to the Pacific, is now nearly completed. The commission recently or ganized under the conventions of 1884 and 1889, it is expected, will speedily set tle disputes growing out of the shifting currents of the Itio Grande river east of El Paso THE NICARAGUA CANAL. The large American interests estab lished in Nicaragua in connection with the Nicaragua caul were not molested in the recert revolutiors in that country. The Canal Company has unfortunately become seri ously financially embarrassed but a generous treatment has beea ex- ended it by the government of Nicara gua. The United States are especially interested in the successful achievement of the vast undmakirg this company has in charge. That it should be accom p ished uu der disticctively American txx epices and its eEj yment assured, not ouly to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interest of civil'z t ion, is a proposition which, in my judgment, dots not admit of ques tion. The message further notej a dictator ship established without bloodshed in Gautemala. Extradiiijn treaties have beeu ma e with Norway and Russia. The United States has entered into a compact with EugUnd and Germany to maintain Malietoa as King of Samoa. The defeated rebellious chief Mataafa, and ten cf his principal supporters, were deported to a German island of the Mar shall group, where they are held as pris oners under the joint responsibility and cost of the three powers. The President next alludes to 

CLAIMS AGAINST SFAIN. Oiher claims preferred by the United States against Spain in behalf of Ameri can citizens for property confiscated in Cuba have been pending for many years At the time Spain's title to the Caroline islands was confirmed by arbitration, that government agreed th.it the rights whica had been acquired there by Ameri can missionaries should be rtc agnized acd respected. It is sincerely hoped that this pledge will be observed by allowing our missionaries who were removed from Ponape to a place of safety by a United State warship during the late troubles between the Spanish garrison and the natives, to return to their field of usefulness. This incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the policy of entangling alliances with foreign pow ers. More than fifteen years ago this government prtferred a claim against cpain in behalf of one of our citizens for property seized and confiscated in Cuba. In 1886 the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to pay unconditionally as a fair indemnity $1,500,000. A respectful but earnest note was recently addressed to the Spanish government insisting upon prompt fulfillment of its long neg.ected obligation. The reproduced caravel, oanta aiaria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian Exposition has been presented to the United States in toEea or am'.ty and in commemorati on of the event it was de signed to celebrate. I recommend that in accepting this gift, Congress make grateful recognition cf the sincere friend ship which prompted it. TURKISH COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR AD JUSTMENT. Important matters have demanded at tention in our rtlations with the Otto man Porte. The firing and partial de struction, by an unrestrained mob, of one of the school buildings of Anatolia Col lege, established by citizens of the United States at Marsovan, and the apparent in difference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwithstanding the com phcity of some of its officials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was fol lowed by promises of reparation and pun ishment of the offenders. Indemnii y for the injury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American owners se cured and efficient protection guaranteed. Information received of maltreatment Buffered by an inoffensive American woman en paged in missionary work in Turkish Koordistan, waB followed by such representations to the Porte as re sulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of her assailere; the removal of delinquent officials, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this coun try net to identify themselves in good faith with our people but with the inten tion of returning to the land of their birth and there engaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation. A journal published in this country in the Armenian language open ly counsels its readers to arm, organize and participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman gov ernment has announced its intention to expel from its dominions Armenians who have obtained naturalization in the United States since 1863. The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of sovereignty It is a right as serted and to a limited extent enforced by the United fctates with the sanction of our highest court. There being no naturalization treaty be tween the United States and Turkey. Our minister at Constantinople has been in structed, that while recognizing the right of that government to enforce its declared policy against naturalized Ar menians, he is expected to protect them from unnecessary harshness of treatment. Claims due us by the Venezuelan re public, in view of the embarrassed finan cial condition of that government, are being paid in installments. The Presi dent hopes arbitration will be employed in settling the boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana. The rati fication by Venezuela of the convention for the arbitration of the long deferred claim of the Venezuelan Transportation Company is awaited. HAWAII. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassments. Just prior to the in stallation of the present administration, the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated be tween the provisional government of the islands and the United States, and sub mitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount, or Georgia, to Honolulu, as a special com missioner to make an impartial invesiiga tion of the circumstances attending the change of government, and of all the con ditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination, Mr. Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all ones t tion that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the intimida tion caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our minister. Upon the facts developed, it seemed to me that the only honorable course lor our government to pursue, was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us, and to restore, as far as practicable, the status existing at the time of cur forcible in- travention. W ith a view of accomplish irgthis result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and rtcogniz iLg all our obligations and responsibili ties growing out of any changed condi tiore, brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate in structions to that end. Thus far no in formation of the accomplishment of any definite results have been received from him Additional advices are soon ex pected. When received they will be promptly sent to the Congress, together with all other information at hand, ac cjmpanied by a special executive mes sage fully detailing all the fa.cts neces sary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the present situation. 

SETTLING DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION By & concurrent resolution passed by the Senate February 14, 1890, and by the House of Representatives on the 3d of April following, the President waa re quested "to invite, from time, as fit occa sions may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United States has, or may have, diplomatic rela tions, to the end that any differences or disputes arising between the govern ments, which canDot be adjusted by dip lomatic agency, may be referred to arbi tration and be peaceably adjusted by such means April 18, 1890, the International Amcr ican Conference of Washington, by reso iution, expressed the wish that the con trovemes between the republics of Amer ica and the nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration, and recommended that the government of each nation rep resented in that conference should com municate this with all friendly powers A favorable response has been received from Great Britain, in the shape of a resolution adopted by Parliament, July 16th last.cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view, and expressing the hope that Her Majesty's government will lend ready co-operation to the government of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted. It aff rda me signal pleasure to lay this par liamentary resolution before the Con gress, and to express my sincere gratifi cation that the sentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authorita tively manifested in favor of the rational and peaceful settlement of international quarrels by honorable resort arbitra tion. 

AMBASSADORS AND THE CONSULAR SERVICE. Fince the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the President to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank which foreign countries accord their agei ts here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany have con ferred upon their representatives at this capital the title of ambassador, and I have responded by according agents of the United States in these countries with the same tit'e. A like elevation of mission is an nounced by Russia, and when made will be similarly met. This step fittingly com ports with the position the United States hold in the family of nations. During my foimer administration, I took occasion to recommend a recast of the laws relating to the consular ser vice in order thst it might become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the iaterests it was intended to subserve. The puties and powers of consuls have been expanded with the growing requirements of our foreign trade, discharging im- j portant duties affecting our commerce i and American citizens abroad, and in certain countries exercising judicial functions. These officers should be men of character, intelligence and ability. Upon proof that the legislation of Den mark secures copyright to American citizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our copyright laws have been extended by proclamation to sub jects oi mat country. 

REVENUE RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES' fv The Secretary of the Treasury reports inatvtne receipts of the government from all sources duri ng the fiscal year ended June 30th, 1893, amounted to $461.716 561 94 and its expenditures to $459,354, 674 29 There was collected from cus toms $205,355,018 73 and from internal revenue $161,027,623 93. Our dutiable imports amounted to $421 856,711, an in crease of $52,453,907 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a -decrease from the preceding year of $13,455-,447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded thote of the preceding year by $7,147,445 32 The total tax collected on distilled spir its was $94,720 260.55; on manufactured tobacco $31,889,711 74, and on fermented liquors $32,548,983 07. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $847,065,194,a decrease of $182,612,954 from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting to $108,680. 844, and exceeding the amounts exported during the preceding year by $53,485, 517. The sum paid from the Treasury for sugar bounty was $9,375,130.88, an increase over the preceding year of $2, 033,053. C9. It is estimated upon the basis of recent revenue laws that the receipts of the gov ernment for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be $430,121,365 38 and its ex penditures $458 121.365 34, resulting in a deficiency of $28,000,000. On the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circula tion or not in Treasury holdings was $1, 718,544 682, an incressa for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25 99. On the same date there was in the Treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273, and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $126,671,553. THE PURCHASE OF SILVER Under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year aggregated 54 008 162 59 fine ounces, which cost, $45,531,374 53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the 1st day of November, 1893, waB 168 674 590 46 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,940 84. Between the 1st day of March, 1873, and the 1st day of Novem ber, 1893, the government purchased under all laws 503 003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $516,622,948. The sil ver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 36,037, 285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was $6,977,098 39, leaving on hand in the mints 140.699,760 fine ounccB of silver, which cost $126,758,218. Our total coinago of all metals durio g the last fiscal year consisted of 97,280,875 pieces valued at $43,685,178 80, of which there was $30,038,140 in gold coin; $5, 343,715 in silver dollars; $7,217,220 90 in subsidiary silver coin, and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins. During the calendar year 1892, the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1,596, 375 fine ounces of gold of the commer cial and coinage value of $33,000,000, and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bul lion or maiket value of $50,750,000, and of the coinage value of $74,989,900. It is es:imated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic Etcck of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bul lion, amounted to $1,213,559,169, of which $57,697,635 was gold, and $615,861,484 was silver. NATIONAL BANK STATISTICS. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending October 31st, 1893, with a capital cf $11,230,000 Forty-six wez.t into vol untary liquidation and one hundred and fifty eight suspended. Sixty five of the suspended banks were insolvent; eighty six resumed business, and seven remain in the hands of bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized 44 were located in the Eastern States, 41 west of the Mis sissippi river, and 34 in the Central and Southern States. The total number cf national bat ks in existence on the 31st of October, 1893, was 3 796, having an aggregate capital of $C9o,55S,120. The net increase in the circu at i m r f these banks during the year was $36,886 972. The recent repetl of the provision cf the law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an en tire change in the complexion of our cur rency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far-resching. THE SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION TO SILVER PURCHASE REPEAL NOT YET READY. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time, pre cisely what conaitions will be brought about by the change, or what, if aay.suD plementary legislation may, in the iistt of such conditions, appear to be essen tial or expedient. Of course, ufter the recent financial depression, time is nec essary for the re establishment of busi ness confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence the moiiey which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a sur vey of the situation will probably dis close a safe path leading to a perma nently Bound currency, abundantly suffl cient to meet every requirement of our increasing population aud business In the puisuit of this object we should res olutely turn away from alluring and tem porary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances, I am convinced that 8 reasonable delay in dealing with this sub ject, instead of being injurious, will in crease the probability of wise action. THE MONETARY CONFERENCE. The monetary conference which assem bled at Brussels upon our invitation was adj turned to the 30th of November of tie present year. The consideration s iust stated and the fact thht a definite proposition irom us seemea to do ex pected upon the re assembling of the conference, led me to exprtss a willing ness to have the meeting still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the President to invite other nations to such & conference at any time when there should be a fair prospect of accomplish ing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. 1 desire also to earnestly suggest me wisdom of 

AMENDING TUE EXISTING STATUTES IN REGARD TO THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERN MENT BONDS The authority now vested in the Sec retary of the Treasury to issue bonds is j not as clear as it should be and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to the government, both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. IMMIGRATION DECREASED. The Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary cf the Treasury, reports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 immigrants.- Of these 1,063 were not per mitted to land under the limitations of the law and 577 of them were returned to the countries from which they came by reason of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 141, 034 less than for the previous year. THE MARINE HOSPITAL SERVICE. The Secretary in his report gives an account of the operation of the Marine Hospital Service and of the good work done under its supervision in preventing the entrance and spread of contagious diseases. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health 'nd the danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has invested the lu' jctt of national quarantine with increased interest. A more cenerVl and harmonious system than now eh&& acting promptly and directly every whet and constantly op erating by prevenuvL Cleans shield our country from the irrFflion ' disease, and at the same time havihlK lue regard to the rights and duties of 161 agencies, would. I believe, add srreatlv to "Jie safe ty of our porta. THE SECRETARY OF WARB REPORT The President next reviews the report of the Secretary of War which was last week made public. He praises highly the efficiency of the State militia. The recommendations of the Secretary of War, as to coast defence, the purchase and emplacement of big guns, and of the use of magazine rifles, and &i propriatiocs therefor, are generally emphasized and approved. The President says concern ing THE 

NATIONAL MILITARY PARK: The work on the projected Chicka mauga and Chattanooga national Milita ry Park has been prosecuted with zeal and judgment and its opening will be celebrated during the coming year. Over nine Bquare miles of the Chicamauga bat tlefield have been acquired, twenty-five miles cf roadway have been constructed, and permanent tablets have been placed at many historical points, while the invi tation to the States to mark the positions of their troops participating in the battle, haB been very generally accepted. The work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg bat tlefield is maintaining satisfactory pro gress on the plans directed by the last Congress. The year's work at West Point and the new Bureau of Military Information are commended. TnE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS In alluding to the report of the Attor ney General, the President endorses the proposition that the fee system, as ap plicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal Courts and United States com missioners, should be abolished, with as little delay as possible. The system, he says, is thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of couit officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a con flict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of the citizens and an irresistible temp tation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If, in addition to this re form, another was inaugurated which would give United States commissioners the final disposition of potty effensea within the grade of misdemeanors, espe cially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more efficient adminis tration of the criminal law. The number of criminal prosecutions pending in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States on the 1st day of July, 1885, was 3,808, of which 1,884 were for violations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of prosecutions pending on the 1st day of July, 1893, was 9.500, of which 4,200 were for violations of tho iat.4 rnal revenue lvws. The exp;-,neo of the Uui ted States courta, exclusive of ja gea salaries, for the year ending July 1, 18S5, was $2 874,733 11, ar d for the rear end ing Jmy 1, 1893, $4,528,676 87. It is therefore apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the Federal criminal 1j.w have gained cogency and strength by Ispse of time. I ateo heartily j -ia the Attorney Gen cral in recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within Federal jurisdiction, as has beea cone in many of the States; authorizing wiiia of error on behalf of the govtrnment in cases where final judgment is rendered sgainst the eufflcieccy cf an indictment, or against the government upon any other question arising before sc;ual trial; limiting the right of review in cases of felony punishable only by fine and im prisonment to the Circuit Court of Ap peals, and making speedy provision for tue construction of such prisons and re formatories as may be necessary for the confinement of united btates convicts, THE 

POSTAL SERVICE. The report of Postmaster General Bia sell, which was made public last week, is reviewed at length by the President. He dwells upon the fact that there will be at the end of the preeent year a deficiency of $8,000,000, and disapproves the idea of extending tho provisions of the free dj livery system to cities smaller than thtsa now erooying its Denents. Forty-two free offices wero added during the year to those already existing, msfcing a total of 610 citks and towns provided with free delivery on June 30, 1893 Ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. The President con tinues: There are connected with the post office establishment 28,324 employes, who are in the classified service. The head of this great department gives conclu sive evidence of the value of civil ser vice reform when, after an experier.ee that renders his judgment on the subject absolutely relinole, he expresses tho opinion that without the benefit of this system it would be impossible to con duct tke vast business intrusted to him I desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the sugges tions of the Postmaster General relating to a more sensible and business-like or ganization and a better distribution of responsibility in his department. THE 

SECRETARY OF THE NAVY'S REPORT. The President calls attention at much length to this report and its recommend ations. In view of the many Bouth American revolutions within the last year, and the Hawaiian trouble, the use fulness of our navy has been conspicuous in the protection of American interests in the belligerent countries. The follow-. ing vessels of the new navy hare beer completed: The double-turrcted coast deienEO monitor Mian tonomab; the double-tor reted coast defense monitor Monterey; . the armored cruiser New York; the pro- tected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Phil adelphia, Newark, San Francisco,. Charleston, Atlanta and Boston; the cruiser Detroit; the gunboats Yorktown Concord, Bennington, Machias, Castlno and Petrel; the dispatch vessel Dolphin; the practice vessel Bancroft, and the dy namite gunboat Vesuvius. Of these the Bancroft, Machias, Detroit and Castine have been placed in commission during : the current calendar year. The following vessels are in process of construction: The second-class battle ships Maine and Texa; the cruiser? Montgomery and Harblehead, and tho coast defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphetrite and Monanock. all of which will be completed within on year; the harbor defense ram Katahdiu and the protected cruisers Columbia, Minneapo lis, Olympic, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will be completed priosto July 1,1895; the Srst class battle ship Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be completed- February il, 1896; and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by August lBt of that year. It is also expected that the three gunboats authorized by the last Congress will bo completed in less than two years. LET US BE
