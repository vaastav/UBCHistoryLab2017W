SUBSCRIPTION$5.00 PER ANNUM WE'LL CONTINUE TO "DO BIZ." Says the Walker Pilot: "JBemidii is exceedingly prolific when it comes to newspapers. The Enterprise which saw the light of day through political glasses there several years ago, and later wobbled out of town for want of sustenance, has been "born again" and will once more endeavor to get a hold on the public patronage teat. A little race suicide, as far as newspapers are concerned, would be a good thing for Bemidji." As for the Pioneer, we are not contemplating "suicide," neither are we going out of business because of this move of some of our neighbors. We shall continue to publish the NEWSIEST newspaper in the north central portion of the state and the new venture is welcome to what it can get. SIMPLY "RECIPROCITY," JUDGE. According to the Bemidji Pioneer, Duluth will not be permitted to play in Bemidji's back yard because Duluth's representatives in the legis lature believe Cass Lake to be the logical location for the sixth Normal school. Rather a boyish excuse, but boys will be boys, sometimes until old age brings "second sight." Cass Lake Times. We are a firm believer in recipro city and if Duluth wholesale con cerns desire to cater to empty busi ness houses of our neighboring vil lage to the east, it is their privilege so to do. The twin cities have excellent jobbing companies which can probably supply all of Bemidji's wants. DRAMATIC STORY OF ANNIS MURDER Member of Bayside Yacht Club on the Stand. Flushing, N. Y., Dec. 19.The most dramatic story yet told of the slaying of William E. Annis was recounted in the trial of Thornton J. Hains, charged with being a principal with his brother, Captain Peter C. Hains, Jr., in the killing of Annis, when Her bert Funke, a member of the Bayside Yacht club, told how Captain Hains, lifting the swinging boom of Annis' beat and calling "Annis," fired sev eral shots at him as he sat at the tiller. "There was a pause after the first shot, then came four shots in succes sion, after which came a single shot," declared Funke "It was after the first shot and before the other shots were fired that Thornton Hains drew his revolver and pointed it at me The prosecution claims that Funke's evidence is another proof of the state's contention that the defendant was a principal and was aiding his brother carrying out a preconceived plan to kill Annis SUNK BY GUNS OF FORT Burning Oil Vessel Endangered Ship ping at Singapore. Singapore, Dec. 19The burning oil ship Kaloma was bombarded by the harbor fort here and finally sank with hei hull riddled with solid shot The flaming steamer, which hails from England, arrived in Singapore from New York two days ago with her cargo of case oil on fire All attempts to extinguish the blaze were unsuc cessful and an effort was made to scuttle the vessel This failed also and the danger to shipping became serious. It was impossible to go near the craft because of the possibility of explosions and finally the harbor agents appealed to the gunners of the fort, who sank the Kaloma with a few well directed solid shot from the for tification's six-inch guns. The dis tance was two miles. PRISONERS PETITION COURT Inmates of Chicago Jail Ask Clem ency for Convicted Man.

FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL George W Wickersham of New York Said to Have Been Tendered the Position by the President-Elect. Exigencies of Pennsylvania Politics May Cause Senator Knox to De cline Secretaryship. Washington, Dec. \).Apparently the important office of secretary of state under the incoming administra tion is still unfilled.

Up to this moment the senator has not yet PHILANDER C. KNOX. reached a decision so far as can he ascertained When asked about the report that he had been offered and had accepted the portfolio of secretary of state in the Taft cabinet Senator Knox said: "I did not start the rumor and can see no reason why I should affirm or deny it."

New York, Dec I That President Elect Taft has selected George W Wickersham of the New York law firm of Strong & Cadwalader to be attorney general in his cabinet was learned from a source that is regard ed as reliable.

CALLS IN A SPECIALIST Secretary Root Suffering From In jured Knee. Washington, Dec j.Secretary of State Root, who has been suffering from an injured knee for two months, has at last called in a specialist to make an examination and treat him. Secretary Root came to the cabinet meeting in his carriage and it was with some difficulty that he left the vehicle. He limped into the White House, apparently with some pain. He remained only a short time at the meeting, leaving long before it was over to keep an engagement at his home with the specialist, who came from Philadelphia. The secretary received his injury during the late political campaigD when he was in Ohio making a stumping tour for Judge Taft. It was not considered serious at the time and he hoped it would mend itself. Bonaparte Still Considering. Washington, Dec. \After thi cabinet meeting and a subsequent eonference with the president Attor ney General Bonaparte said that the department of justice still had under consideration the question of prose cuting those persons whom the presi dent considers guilty of criminal libei in connection with publications re Carding the Panama canal nurrhase

UNABLE TO CARRY ON FOREIGN WAR Reported Declaration by Vene zuela Discredited. Berlin, Dec. 19Both the German foreign office and President Castro discredit the report that Venezuela has declared war against The Neth erlands. The foreign office takes the ground that even if hostilities have been declared the declaration cannot become effective because Venezuela is in no position to carry a campaign beyond its own borders and Holland will not exceed the limits of its re taliatory course as already fixed and known to the United States. The feeling is also growing here that President Castro left South America not because of illness but to escape the political turmoil and that he has no intention of ever returning. The Hague, Dec. 19.The foreign office here places no credence in the report that Venezuela has declared war against The Netherlands. Even if the war rumor should turn out to be true the government considers that the Dutch squadron now in South American waters is sufficient to meet all eventualities. Notable Missionary Meeting.
