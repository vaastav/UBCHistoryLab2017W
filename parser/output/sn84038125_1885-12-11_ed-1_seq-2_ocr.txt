President's Message, aside frin his "gold-bug" antipathy to silver, is mainly good, but be is verbose to the verge of gar rulity. If Dana would put him on the Sun Wli moeths as a reporter, he would learn to talk ees and say more. It is fortunate fur MNontatn that Congress is not as crazy-on the slser question as the President. A 4TUAxoKs verdict was returned by a jury in Walls Wal!. a few days ago. A man "amed James Close had killed two Indians. -be evidence seemed conclusive that Close bed killed the Indians, but there were cir cumstauees connected with it palliating the elena.. The jurl retired and after being *tsixtsua hours brought in a verdict that Close was guilty of "assault and battery." The Union seems to think there is some thing strange about the verdict, and it will strike almost ediMyone the same way. Tais Vies President's widow is left in comfortable circumstances. Shbe has herself largely taken charge of the private business afairs of her husband, and has managed them with signal success -"much better," the Vice President used to say, "than I seuld have done myself." The residence where Mr. Hendricks died, in Indianapolls, is worth $10,000, and be had other property In the city valued, all told, at about $00,000. His life was also insured in a considerable sum. Altogether it is estimated that he will leave $100,000.-Ezchange. 

WILLIAM aH. VANDEI)RILT, who died suddenly in New York, was 064 years andl seven months old, having been born on Staten Island in May, 1821. He was engaged in an amicable business conversation with I'resident Garrett, of the B. & 0. railway, at his home, when he fell forward on the floor and died instantly. He was one of the the wealthiest men in the world, his income being over ten million dollars a year. His wealth was rated next to that of the Duke of Westminster, who is estimated worth $200,000,000; but his income was greater than the Duke's. He will be bhuried to-day. Death Is no respecter of persont: or money. Tue President has sent a battery of artil lery to Camp Douglas, and one of the com. panies from that post has been quattered in Salt Lake City. That is right. The polygamists are restless and feverish under the execution of the laws against them, and non-polygamous life is insecure without the government asserts Itself right in the strong bold. That has been done. The polyga mists do not like the presence of the military, but they will respect it, and that is Just what I, necessary. General McCook don't watt to hurt anybody, but he will blow the ever lasting smithereens out of every fornicating Mormon in Utah if they lntes fore with his boys in blue. 

JUDOE POI.LArID, of Delphi, Intdiana, ap pointed last week to succ ed Judge Coburn as Associate Justice of Montana, is reported to us as being an excellent lawye-r and an upright man. He has a large practice and Is highly esteemed in Indiana, but Is in bad health from the malaria of the fever and ague district of the hoop pole State oand de sired the appointment here. As we under stand, Judge Beeves, of Klsoula, had the endorsement of the Montena Democratic "powers that be" for tle position, but thbe "carpet bag" was too big fbr them to roll out of the way. While President Cleve land's excuses for doing tblh kind of thing are gross evasions of acknowledged duty, and based on a very mistaken estimate of our Territorlal people and their Jurists, we are still pleased to learn that altbough he will send carpet beag Judges, be has sent in this ainstance a g.ood man.

ELATIONS WITH CHINA. The harmony of our relations with Chins is fully sustained in the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of 8ItM restrictive of the immigration of Chi nese laborers into the United 8tates. Indi vidual cases of hardship have occurred be. yond the power of the Executive to remedy, and calling for judicial determination. The condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and Territories is, despite this restrictive legislation, far from teing satisfactory. The recent outbreak in Wyo uting Territory, where numbers of unofend ing Chinamen, iudisputably within the pro tection of the treaties and the law, were nmulrered by a mob, and the still more recent threatened outbreak of the same character in Washington Territory, are still fresh in the minds of all, and there is apprehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the Mongo lian race on the Pacific slope may find vent in similar lawless demonstrations. All the power of this Government should be exerted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men and the Inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrongdoers to justice should be insisted upon. Every effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent out. breaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation of these outra ges, and it is but just to say that they are traceable to the lawlessness of men, not citi zens of the United States, engaged in com petition with Chinese laborers. Race preju dice is the chief factor in originating these disturbances, and it exists in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our peace and the goodI relationship we try to maintain with China. The admitted right of a government to prevent the influx of elements hostile to its Internal peace and security may not be questioned, even where there is no treaty stipulation on the subject. That the exclu sion of Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail is strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Can ada, where Chinese immigration is now reg ulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If the existing laws are inadequate to com pass the end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measure within the treaty bill which, in their wisdom, Congress may de vise. A VI(;OiOUs ATTACK ON SILVER COINAGE. Nothing more important than the present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since February, 1878, this Government has, under the compulsory provisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more than 52,000,000 every month. By this process up to the present date 215,75.1,431 silver dollars have been coined. A reasonable appropria tion of a delegation of power to the general Government would limit its exercise without express restrictive words to the people's needs and the requirements of the public welfare. Upon this theory the authority "to coin money," given Congress by the Consti tution, if it permits the purchase by the Government of the bullion for coinage, in any event it does not justify such purchase and coinage to an extent beyond the amount needed to suffice as a circulating medium. The desireto utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to the silver currency of the Nation as is compelled by the silver coin age act, is negatived by the fact that up to the present time only about 50,000,000 of sil ver dollars so coined have actually found their way into circulation, leaving more than 1165,000,000 in the possession of the Government, the custody of which has en tailed considerable expense for the construo tion of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certificates amounting to about $03,000,000. Every month 52,000,000 of gold in the public treasury are paid out for 2,000,000 or more of silver dollars to be adeesd to the idle mass already accumualated. If continued long enough, this operation will result in the sub stitution of silver for all the gold the Gaov ernment owns, applicable to its general pur poess. It will not do to rely upon the receipts of the Government to make good this decline of gold, because the silver thus coined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues public and private At times during the last six months 5 per cent of the receipts for duties bave been in silver or silver certificates, while the average within that period uhas been 20 per cent. The pro portion of silver and its certllcates received by the Government will probably increase as time goes on, for the reason bthat the nearer the period approaches when It will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obli gationa the greater inducement there will be to board the gold aglainst depression in the value of silver or for the purpose of speeula tion. This hoarding of gold has already began. When the time comes that all the gold has been withdrawn frofa circulation then will be apparent the difference between the real value of the silver dollars and a dol Iht in gold, and the two coins will part aomrn Gold is still the standard of value and -ecessarily in our deallngs with other coun tries it will be at a premium over silver. Banks which have substituted gold for the deposits of their customers may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome proit. Rich specula tors willsell their boarded gold to their neighbors who need it to liquldate their for eign debts at a ruinous premium over silver, rnd the laboring men and women of the land,'the most defenseless of all, will and that the dollar receioved for the wages of their toll has sadly shrank in Its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary and that ultimately the price of laber will be adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place the wageworker cannot possibly gal bet must inevitably lose, since the price he is con. pelled to pay for a living will not only be mesasred in acola heavily depreeteid and fluctuating sad uncertain In vales, bet this unoenrsainty nto the value of the pemehbs lng medium will be made the prtest Br an advance in prices beyoad that jusifid by the actual depreclatson. The words uttered in 181 by Daniel Webster in thb Senate of the United States are true to day: "The very anrs of all others who beh the deepess inter at is a sound eavtesay and who suEers most by tmaobLevieet legislatuoe n money mat. tern i the man who earn his daily bread ny his dolly totl." The most diatinnglsbed ad vocate of hI-anslless. dlcinlrr g ecr allver einea, bhas laer l written: "N. Amerien essea's hand has yet ftli the esesksseu of eheapness, either tn receiving or espedaing th sdilver nt dollas," and those who live by labor or legitatsa trade never will feel drat asaseilae of ehepeme. However plenty diver dellm may heWpne te will not he dihatemd ssul aseeg the pe sp and if tes laering man lse l rseslive fear depredtad ieltg wher e oe seer saves but two be wll pae l the a tesd ea eres thne doable the pries be .w s see aM tles soset end sowl s IM These whs do moc fear -an se sseuerof dtiesr, as *ew* mdlls**d by tw, and who wýapse hmeth s rWMiltKes a t ewarr of Seatry ihe eelst s issub, wtU*pR buspl hat a* e agor i e mra ainl gueset i~W)~k of course, must produce a severe contract iono of our circulating medium instead of adding I to it. It will not be dispoted that any at tempt on the part of the Governmeat to cause the circulation of the silver dollar, worth 8S cents, side by side with the gold dollars, worth 100 eents, even with the limit I that leglelation does not run contrary to the a laws of trade, to be successful it mast be eeo- I onded by the confidence of the people that r both colis will retain the same purchasing power, and be lIterchangeable at will. A special effort has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury to Increase the amount of I oursilver coin in circulation, but the fact that a large share of the limited amount thus i put out has soon returned to the public treasury in the payment of duties, leads to the belief that the people do not now desire s to keep it in hand,and this, with the evident I dispositien to board gold, gives rise to the I suspicion that there already exists a lack of confidence among the people touching our I financial prooess. There is certainly not I enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness, and the whole amount coined and now on band might after a time be ab sorbed by the people without apprehension, but it is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land which causes fear and uncertainty. What has been thus far sub mitted upon this subject relate? almost entirely to the consideration of a home nature, unconnected with the bearing which the policies of other nations have upon the question; but it is perfectly apparent that a line of action in regard to our currency cannot wisely be settled upon or persisted in without considering the atti tude on the subject of other countries with whom we maintain intercourse through commerce, trade and travel. An acknowl edgment of this is found in the act by virtue of which our silver is compulsorarily coined. It provides that the President shall invite the Governments of the countries compoe ing the Latin Union (so-called), and of such other European nations as he may deem ad visable, to join the United States in a con ference to adopt a common ratio between gold and silver for the purpose of establish ing internationally the use of bi-metallic money, and securing the fixity of the rela tive value between these metals. This cot, ferenco absolutely failed, and a similar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direction, and still we continue our coinage of silver at a ratio different from that of any other nation. The most vital part of the silver coinage act remains imper ative and unexecuted, and without an ally or friend we battle upon the silver field in an illogical and losing contest. To give full effect to the design of Congress on this sub ject, I have made a careful and earlnest en deavor since the adjournment of the last Congress. To this end I delegated a gentle man well instructed in fiscal science to pro ceed to the financial centers of Europe, and in conjunction with our Ministers to Eng land, France and Germany, to obtain a full knowledge of the attitude and intent of those Goverments respecting the establishment of such an international ratio as would procure the free coinage of both metals at the mints of those countries and our own. BIy my direction our Consul General at Paris has given close attention to the proceedings of the Congress of the Latin Union, in order to indicate our interest in its objects and report its actions. It may be said in brief as the result of these efforts, that the attitude of the leading Powers remains sutetantially un changed since the monetary conference of 1881, nor is it to be questioned that the views of those Governments are in each instance separated by'the weight of public opinion. The steps thus taken have therefore only more folly demonstrated the uselessness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on the subject with other nations. In the meantime we are accumulating silver coin, based upon our peculiar ratio, to such an extent andl assuming so heavy a hurdcu to be provided for in any international ne gotiations as will render us an undesirable party to any future monetary conference of the nations. It is a siguificant fact that four of the five countries composing the Latin Union mentioned in our coinage act, embar rassed with their silver currency, have just completed an agreement among themselves that no more silver shall be coined by their respective Governments, and that such as has already been coined and ln circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of its coinage, 'Phe resort to this expedient by those countries may well arrest the attention of those who suppose we can succeed, with out shock or injury, in the attempt to circu late upon its merits all the silver we may coin under the provisions of the silver coin age act. The condlition inu which our treas- ury may be placed by a persistence in the present course, is a matter of concern to every patrotic citizen who does not desire his Government to pay in silver such of its obligations as should be paid in goll. Nor should our condition Ie such as to ohlilge us to discontinue the calling in and payment of interest-bearing obligations, which we have the right now to discharge and thus avoid the payment of further interest. The so-called debtor class, for whore ben. efit the continued compulsory coinage of silver ts intisted on, are nout dishonest be cause they are in debt, and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeopardize thet financial safety of tihe country in order that they may cancel their present debts by pay lug the same in depreciated dollars; nor should it be forgotten that it is not the rich nor the money-lender alone that must sub mit to such a readjustment enforced by the Government and their debtors. The pit. tanoe of the widow and orphan, and the in comes of helpl-es beneficiaries of all kinds, would be disastrously reduced. The depos itors in savings banks and other institutions which hold in trut the savings of the poor, when their little aoonumlations are scaled down to meet the new order of things, would in their distress painfully realise the delu sion of the promise made to them that plen. tiful money would improve their condition. We have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the present need of the people and to satisfy those who from senti ment wish to see them In ciroulation, and if their coolage is suspended, they can be read Ily obtaled by those who desire them. If the need of more is at any time apparent, their colnage may be resumed. That this disaster has not already overtaken Iu, I.r aLses no prt that the deaser does no wait upon a contlanution of the present sil ver coilage. We have been saved by the me.t easerhl marageesat and unsual expe dists, by a eembinatios of fobrunate eondl tions, tad by a confidet eopeeation that the commeres of the Government in regard to silver eeinage would be speedily ebaged by an m etion of Congress.

Thus is the strange spectacle pro sentted of a ccmmunity protected by a Re p ublican form of government, to which they owe allegiance, sustaining by their saufage a principle and a belief which sets at aaught that obligation of absolute obedience to the law of the land which lies at the foundation of Republican lastitutions. The strengtb, the perpetuity and the destiny of the Nation rest upon our homes, established by the law of God, guarded by parental care, regulated by parental authority, and saucsaled by parental love. These are not the homes of polygamy. The mothers of our land, who rule the Nation, as they mould the characters and guide the actions of their sons, live ac cording to God's holy ordinance, and eachb, pure and happy in tle exclusive love of the father of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood, unperverted and unpol luted, upon all within her pure and whole some family circle. These are not the cheer less, crushed and unwomanly monthers of polygamy. The fathers of our families are the best citizens of the Republic. Wife and childrsn are sources of patriotismru, an con jugul and parental aftctioni beget devotion to the country. The man who undefiled with plural marriage is surrounded it, his single home with his wife and children, as a status in the country which itspires im with respect for its laws and courage for its defense. These are not the ftthers of polyg amous families. There is no feature of this practice, or the system which sanctions it, which is not opposed to all that is of value into our institutions. There should be no re laxation in the firm but just execution of the law now in operation, and I should be glad to approve such further discreet legislation as will rid this country of this blot upon its fame. IT Is somewhat dlifficult to determine the animus of Samuel J. Tilden in writing a let ter to Speaker Carlisle oin public affairs just on the eve of the l'resident's message, and giving it to the press for publication before it was received by the person to whom it was addressed. Is Uncle Sammy in his dotage, or was he trying to take the wind out of Cleveland's sails? Or was it a col lusion between them to reach different ele ments of the Democratic party in a scheme to expend the bulk of the Treasury surplus in New York ? WLile protection of the sea coast is proper enough, the conditions under which this letter was written and published are such as to arouse considerable interest regardinlg the motives that prompted it. Unless there was collusion, it was a discour tesy to the President. FRtOM telegrams in eastern papers we be. lieve the suits against the Mortana Improve memnt Company will not be prosecuted. It appears to be the view of the Interior De partment that the action was hasty and ill advised, and that convictions could not be had on the charges made by Special Agent lailey. In fact the ofcers of the Montana Improvement Company were about to bring action against Halley for libel at this term of the U. S. Court here, but as his report was made In Idaho, and he is resident there, it was dropped as being outside of the juris diction. We will probably hear no more of the Sparks suits. THE 

UNITED STATES SENATE. Sherman Elected President Pro Tem. WAsmIatOTOr, Dec. 7.--The Senate was called to order at 12 M. After prayer Ed muuds nominated Senator Sherman for Plresadent of the Senate, in accordance with the caucus decision of Saturday. Voorhees moved to substitute the name of Harris. Yeas and nays were then ordered upon Voorhees' motion. Voorbees' amendment was lost by a strict party vote, wbereupon Sherman was elected without fusther division. uCommittees were appointed to notify the Presideint and House of the organization of the Senate. Then upon motion of Edmunds, at 12:25 o'clock, the Senate took a recess of half an hour to await the organization of the House. The galleries of the Senate have not for many years been so crowded on the open ing day of the session. The walls of the Senate chamber were draped in deep black, out of respect to the memory of the late Vice President. Upon request of Secretary Mckook, Mr. Sherman was escorted to the chair by Edmunds and Voorbees, and the oath of office was administered to him by Edmunds. Sherman then said: Senators-I return you my grateful thanks for the high honor you have conferred upon me. In common with all the people of the United States, I feel profound sorrow for the sudden death of the Vice Psesident, who, by the Cunstitutlon, is also declared to be President of the Senate. A contingency has sow arrived when it becomes the impera tive duty ol the Senate to elect a Plesident pro tern. In accepting the position assigned me, I feel that there are many Senators on either side of the House more apt nla tbe dis charge of the duties of this position, and more ezperienced In the rules and orders of thbe Senate than myself, tll I accept with a sincere desire that I may be able to enforce the rules with kindness and impartiality, so as to ascertain if possible the sense of the majorlty of the enate, and to give the minority its full Constitutional rights and protection. With a sincere desire for such protection and with a sincere desire for per forming this dty, I appeal to each Individ ual Senator for blh courtesy and forbear. ance.

Its Date of Publication Appears Discourteous to the President. Nsw Y(cs, Dec. 5.-Mr. Samuel J. Til den has sent the following letter to Heon. John G. Carlisle: GaIYSTONx, YOeNKEtS, N. Y., December 1, 1885. Dear Mr. Carlisle: As public opinion points to you as the Speaker of the next House of Represen.a tives I desire to submit a suggestion as to one of the public objects for which an appro priation ought to be provided and a liberal one. In considering the state and manage ment of public revenues the subject involves questions whether we shall extinguish the surplus by reducing the revenue or whether we shall apply the surplus to payments on the public debt, or whether we shall seize the occasion to provide for our sea coast de fenses, which have been long neglected. I am of the opinion that the latter is of para mount necessity and ought to precede the reduction of revenue and ought also to pre cede an excessive rapidity in the payment of tle public debt. The property exposed to destruction in twelve seaports, Portland, Portsmouth, Boston, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Savan nah, New Orleans, Galveston, and San Francisco, cannot be less in value than live billions of dollars. This must be added to the vast amount of property dependent for its use on these seaports. Nor does this statement afford a true measure of the dam age which might be caused to the property and business of the country by a failure to protect these geaports from hostile naval attacks. They are the centers not only of foreign commerce but of most of the inter national trade and exchanges of domestic productions. Interruption of the currents of tramc by the occupation of one or more of our principal seaports by a foreign enemy, the destruction of them by bombardment, or the holding over them of a menace of destruction for the purpose of exacting con tribution or ransom, would inflict upon the property and business of the country an injury which can neither be foreseen nor measured. The elaborate and costly forti fications which were constructed with the greatest engineering skill are now practically useless. They are not capable of resisting the attacks of modern artillery. A still greater defect exists in our coast defenses. The range of the best modern artillery has become so extended that our present fortifications, designed to protect the harbor of New York where two-thirds of the import trade and more than one-half of the export trade of the whole United States is carried on, are too near to the great popula tions of New York City, Jersey City, and Brooklyn to be of any value as protection. To provide effectual defenses would be a work of years. It would take much time to construct permanent fortifications. A small provision of the best modern guns would take several years. Neither of these works can be extemporized in the presence of emergent danger. A million soldiers, with the nest equipments, on heights com manding the harbor of New York In our present state of preparation, or rather in our total want of preparation, would be power less to resist a small squadron of war steam tre. This state of things is discreditable to our foresight and prudence. The best guar antee against aggression, the best assuran :es that our diplomacy will be successful and peeale and our rights and honor be respected by other nations, is In their knowledge that we are in a situation to vindicate our repu tation and interests. While we may afford to be deficient in the means of offense we cannot afford to be defenseless. The note worthy fact that we have neglected ordinary precautions of defense invites a want of con sideration in our diplomacy, injustice, arro gance and insult at the hands of foreign nations. It is now more thean sxty years sirce we announced to the world that we should re sist any attempts, from whatever quarter thbey might come, to make any new colont rations on any part of the American coLti nent; that while we should respect the atatu quo we should protect the peoples of the different nations inhabiting this continent from every attempt to subject them to the dominancy of any foreign powers or to inter fere with their undisturbed exercise of the rights of self-government: This announce ment was formally made by President Mon roe after consulting with Madison and Jeff erson. It was formulated by John Quincy Adams. Our government has fairly adhered to the Monroe doctrine, and even as late as 1865 warned Napoleon III. out of Mexico. It is Impossible to forsee from the Indecent scramble of European poweis for the acequl. sition of colonies, how soon an occasion may arise for our putting in practice the Monroe doctrine. It is clear that there ought to be some relation between our assertion of that doctrine and our preparations to maintain it. It is not intended to recommend any attempt to rival the great Evropean powers in the creation of a powerful navy. The changes which have rapidly occuired by diminution of the relative resisting power of defensive armor of iron clads, and by the increased efeleiecy of modern artillery, which on the whole has gained in competition, suggests that we should not at present enter largely nto the creation of armored vessels. In the questions that best this subject until they have reached a solution, we should content ourselves with adding but sparingly to our navy. But what we do add should be the very best that science or experience can Indleate. This prudential view is reinforced by the consideration that the annual expense ao maintalniag war vessels bears an impor teant proportlon to the original cost of con Mrntiag permanent fortiftations and pro viding as ample supply of the best modern artillery. In the latter the annual cost of mslatemanes is inconsiderable. Nearly the whole expenditure is in the original outlay eoafruetleo. If we do not make the ex penditure now which is necessary to provide lbr our sea coast defense, and while we have asurplue and have no need to levy new taes, we cetainly will be compelled to mabe these expeuditures when we have no largei surplus I the treasury.

The United Stales Marshal Escorts Them Back to British Columbia. PonTL.AANN,, Or., Dl)c. 4.-A Seattle, W. T., special says: The dlspute regarding the disposition of theli twenty-live Chinamen smuggled from lit ishl Columbia was brought to a close yesterday by summary action on the part of the Unitedu States au thorities. This case has excited wide atten tion. It will be temembered that these Chinamen were found some months ago on a rock in the Straits of Fuca, where they had been abandoned by the master of a schooner, who had been attempting to smug gle them into the United States. They were brought before the United States Commis sioner, and the Malshal was ordered to escort them back to British Columbia. The au f thorities of that province refused to receive them without the payment of $50 a head, the tax required by the Canadian law. The Marshal accordingly returned with them, and they have since been confined in the United States peni',ntiary at McNeill's Island. On Monday last they were brought before the United States Court here, and Judge Greene instructed United States Mar shal George to escort them across the bound ary line and leave them in British Columbia without regard to the protest of the British Columbian authorities. Marshal George accordingly took them to Semishmoo, a town near the boundary line, and then escorted them across the line and two miles nto tile Canadian territory. They were turned loose there, having previously bee supplied with provisions for several days. The heathens started at once for New West minster, having no desire to return to the United States. A BARREN INVESTIGATION. A Grand Jury Smell a Mouse but Fail to See Him. SAN FIANtcisco, Dec. 5.-The United States Grand Jury, which for some time past has been investigating the alleged frauds in connection with Chinese return certificates, made its report this evening. Over ninety witnesses had Leen examined. Among them were the publishers, editors antd re porters of the newspapers of thlis city, and a number of custom offlicials. After referring to the cateless manner in which the certiti cates were kept by the officials intrusted with their issuance, the report says: '.While the evidence before us perhaps did not posi tively fasten the guilt of fraudulently issuing certificates upon any particular person, still, that they were so issued, the jurors have not the shadow of a doubt. It is equally clear t that gross fraud has taken place in landing the Chinese satce the restriction act went into effect. It would seem that the loose practices have grown up in connection with the landing of Chinese under writs of habeas corpus, and possibly frauds have been per petrated in connection with it." The Grand Jurors express the opinion in their report that the authorities at WVashingtont have not always afforded the needed facilities for car lylng out faithfully the provisions of the Iaestricltion Act. The report concludes by r saying: "We are convinced that gross irreg ularities and frauds have been perpetrated, rand that these could not have been done except with the connivance or assltance of Scertain oflicia!s connected with the customs t department." The whole matter is thsn Sleft to a future grand jury without any in Sdicmenits benlg found. A RAILWAY KING DEAD. William H. Vanderbilt Expires at His Home In New York. NEW YORK, Dec. 8.-William H. Vander bilt died this af.ernoon at 2:30 o'clock, at his residence, from the effects of paralysis of the brain. J. Pierrepout Morgan said that Mr. Van derbilt's death would have little or no effect on the market; that the West Shore nego. tiations would go on as before, and that a cablegram had been sent to London with information of his death, which no doubt would be received there with a good deal of regret. Pool Commissioner Fink said that Mr. Vanderbilt's death would have no effect on pools as he had been out of the arrangement for some time. No doubt the death of such a prominent man would be felt as a great loss by the mercantile world. Henry Clews said that Mr. Vanderbflt's death, no doubt, would have some effect on the mauket, as it would be used by those who always sought to make capital out of a calamity, but this would not be of a serious character, and there was nothing to fear.

SPARKS MODIFIES HIMSELF. "Entries Not Subject to Reasonable Doubt" Will be Patented Special to Pioneer Press. SWAsIINoTONs, Dec. 3.-Commissioner Sparks has been crowded so heavily that he 1 gave way a little to day and issued an order , modifying his famous edict of last Apr!l. There was a rumor about the department t this afternoon that the "'eneral" had de cided to issue patents for all entries liled I before he took charge of the ollice, which would have relieved 50,000 settlers in the Northwest from his clutches; but he did not go so far. He only threw a very small tub r to the whale, and issued an announcement that he will permit the issue of patents upon i all "entries not subject to reasonable doubt," i namely: First-In contests where the rights of suc I essfu, patents have been established, which means that persons whose claims have been contested and who had presented evidence to sustain their legality, will not be deprived of the result of their contest. This refers only to exceedingly few claims, perhaps a dozen or more a week. Second--le will certify patents where examinations have been made by the gov ernrmern detectives and no fraud found. There are now about twenty agents and detectives examining claims, and they man age to get throrugh about fur a week, at which rate it will take them something like 150 years to cuomplet. the work Sparks has given I hlmn. Third--Ile will certify to homestead en tries wherel rrsidelrnc, improvements and cultivation have been made according to law. In itlher wi,dis, he will lassue patents to those who have lived five years upon their homesteads anrd have made the legal im provements and ramount, of cultivation re quired; but this class is very small, as most homesteaders who ha e beens industrious and prosperous desire to commute their time and get their patents without waiting the full tme o,f five years. In order that the settlers in tihe Northwest, from 73 to 1)00 per cent of whom, accrldling to Sparks, are swrndlers, may not jilpose upon the inno cent commlissioler, Mr. Sparks requires that all such cases as above described shall be submitted to a board c.,nsisting of Assistant Commissioner Srockslager, the chief clerk of the department, and La arrnes, the chief law clerk. As Mr. L.s Barnes is the man who has made all the trouble and has con. virced Sparks that the people of the North west are thieves, the work of this commis sloner will naturally be limited. BROKEN UP. The Labor Convention in San Francisco Closed by the Socialists. SAN FaAxcisco, Dec. 5.-The convention called by the Knights of Labor, which opened last Monday, closed to-night. Ses sions were held evety night of the week ex cept two. The convention opened under excellent auspices and with hopes of acconm plishing much toward practically solving tle labor question of the Pacific coast, but has accomplished nothing. Manly good results that might have been obtained favorable to the workingmen were defeated by the non senalical resolutions offered by the Socialists, who were largely represented. The prob lems submitted for the considerationl of the convention were the Chinseese quesllion, col. vict labor and the causeo of the present colm mercial depression. At the meeting a reso. lution was adopted that the Chinese be notified to leave San Francisco within sixty days. This was finally amendel. to read "lmmediately," and that the owners of prop erty occupied by the Chinese be notified that unless they turned the Chinese out their property would be endangered. The Knights of Labor delegation immediately left the ball and the same evening they informed the convention that they could not endorse any resolutions tending toward violence, and gave notice of their withdrawal. This prac tically ended the convention, as their exam pie of withdrawing from it was followed by a number of other organlzations. - ',4 ~- --,. .. Shall Blaine Succeed Miller? Naw Yoax, Dec. 4.--A Washington cor respondent of the Telegream dishes up a bit of political gossip, to the effect that Blaine is considering the possibility of removing to the far West, tempted by the promise of a Senatorial position. The correspondent says as a matter of fatt, direct overtulres have been made him from two States to take this step. Blaine never has been popular in the East. His strength has always been in the West. The people of that section like his dash and vim. He would be an Ideal West. ern Senator. One of these States is Call fornta. S-uator Miller's health is In a very precarious condition, and it is even now a doubtful queation whether he will be able to reture bete th's winter. II.s term of ,eiee espires in March, 1887.
