GOLDFIEJLD, Nev., Dec. 7.-Encour eged, doubtless, by the presence of fed eral troops, the Goldfleld Mine Owners' association held a meeting this afternoon and tonight gave out a statement in which It is openly said that the mem bers of the association have decided to make a determined struggle to free Gold fleld of union domination and make this an open camp. The statement of the purpose of the mine owners is direct and unequivocal and throws down tho gauntlet to the Western Federation of Miners. Officers of the association refused to say If any Bteps have already been taken toward Importing non-union miners in sufficient numbers to reopen the mines, which are now idle and rapidly filling with water, but stated that many telegrams are be ing received hourly offering men and within forty-eight hours the mines could be opened with the same number of men as were formerly at work in them. One Thousand Men Ready One concern In San Francisco, It is said, offered today to send 1000 men on one hour's notice. The officers of the association say, however, that In their belief there are enough men in the camp who will leave the union now to make the importation of men unnecessary, and they are look- Ing for these men to make application early In the coming week. It is impossible, the operators say, for tuni to get enough men in the mines at present to operate the pumps and keep them clear of water. Caveins are constantly taking place and other darn- Bga Is being wrought by reason of the inactivity. - No unusual excitement was caused by the arrival of the first detachment of troops ami the crowds that gathered at the depot quickly dispersed after the troops had marched to the mesa in the northwestern part of the city, where they have gone into temporary encampment\ Tonight Goldfleld is quiet and there arc DO Indications of impending trouble. 283 Soldiers in Camp In the command of Col.

Cal.. with 150 men of companies C. E. F, G and H of the Twenty-second Infantry. With, the two detachments are Capt. Richardson, ad jutant; Capt. Wolfe, quartermaster; Captains Wassell and Stewart and Majors Fredericks and Krepp. Capt William Cox, a member of Gov ernor Sparks' staff and the personal rep resentative of the governor, is In Gold field tonight In conference with Col. Reynolds. He states that Governor Sparks' action in requesting that troop? be sent to Goldfleld was merely a pre cautionary measure and not based on any overt acts of the union men. He refused to say tonight whether Col. Reynolds would be asked by the gover nor to station men at or near the mines In case the ownerß decide to make an effort to start up the mines with non union men. Col. Reynolds refused to say whether he would take such action. Officers of the local union and of the Western Federation of Miners stated to night that the only grievance of the union miners Is over the matter of accepting scrip issued by John S. (Jook & Co., the only banking concern now doing business in ©o'.efleld, which they say the mine owners refused to guarantee pereonally. There are about 1300 Western Federation miners now out in the entire camp.

Mack lnton, ps^sldent of the Goldfleld Miners' union, in which he says: "There Is no care man in the district •who will say that there was any need for the federal troops in Goldfleld." The paper says editorially: "It is evl- Hent that the Mine Owners' association Intends to re-enact the tragic scenes of- Co'.orado. "The coming of troops means nothing short of that. Violence and disorder will ensue upon the arrival of the troops, and It Is apparent that the gloomy history of Colorado 1b to be rewritten." A statement to the public issued to night by the Golafleld Mine Operators' association, states in the beginning that "repeated outrages against individuals' rights ana banishment from the camp of men desirous of Investing In the- mines, open looting of every mire carrying high grade ore and deeds of violence have be come so unbearable that the owners must either close the mines, hand them over to the union, or make a desperate effort to gain the right to work them as we please. "We have chosen the latter alternative, and propose to make one final struggle for the right to manage our own prop erty." Citizens Beaten The paragraph concludes: "Individual miners and citizens who have incurred the enmity of the union have been beaten at night by the score and compelled to leave the camp. Citizens of the camp and merchants who have dared to protest against or even disprove these outrages have been threatened, boycotted, beaten and even murdered," continues the state- Specific Instances of outrages of this nature alleged to have been committed uy the union miners are detailed. .

DEA TH CALLS KING OSCAR OF SWEDEN AGED MONARCH SUCCUMBS TO ILLNESS STRUGGLES IN VAIN AGAINST DISEASE Members of Family and Court Offi. cials Summoned to Bid Fare well to Beloved Ruler By Associated Press STOCKHOLM, Dec. B.— Kins Oscar of Sweden Is dead. The aged monarch, who was sorely stricken several days ago and who at that time turned over the reins of government to the crown prince, died at 3:13 o'clock this morning. It was known last night that the king could not recover, and although tho theaters and other places of amusement were opened as usual, the crowds, num bering thousands, patiently waiting in a pouring rain in front of the palace, tes tified their sympathy for the aged mon arch, whose life was slowly ebbing away. Within the palace members of the royal family, high ecclesiastics, the premier and the minister of foreign affairs, had been assembled for some hours in tho klng'3 study, to which room his majesty had been removed in bed at noon when still unconscious. This measure was taken to enable all the family and the officials to be present at the last moments without undue crowding. The physicians in attendance admin istered stimulants, consisting of saline solution, camphor and digitalis, which were injected at Intervals, and they re lieved also, as far as possible, the veslcal trouble, from which the king has suffered severely alf through the Illness. They, however, could accomplish very little more than the bringing back of their patient to momentaray consciousness. Every effort was made to reduce the pain to a minimum, and this apparently was successful. In the expectation that life would be prolonged until Sunday morning the ministers left the palace at 11 o'clock, tho various members of the royal family withdrawing for the time being from the slek room. King Oscar II was born In Stockholm January 21, 1829. He was a great grand son of Napoleon's famous general, Mar shal Bernadotte, who was the first king of the now independent kingdom of Nor way.

WHY NOT CONDUCT EXPLANATIONS Along the Lines of Your Business Methods? SAYS U.S. IS DRIFTING TO REVOLUTION RAILROADS GRAB ALL IN SIGHT AND PEOPLE REBEL Secretary of Inland Waterways Com mission Asserts Corporate Inter, ests Are Throttling Navigation and Robbing Country By Assocla-.eti Pnra. CHICAGO, Dec. 7.— That the rapid acquisition of America's riparian rights by the railroads and other private In terests Is Involving the country in a situation which threatens a revolution was the startling assertion made last night by W. J. McGee, secretary of the United States Inland waterways com mission. The speaker affirmed that this ac tivity of private interests Is throttling navigation and depriving the country of its greatest single source of wealth. Mr. McG'ee was addressing the annual dinner of the Geographic society of Chicago on "Tho Mississippi and Its Future," "The country is on the verge of a revolution of a grave character," Mr. McGee declared. "The absolute mono poly of our lands and our waterways by a certain few private individuals will certainly result If the people do not take steps to protect their riparian rights. The railroads are our menace. "From St. Paul to New Orleans there Is not a single town excepting Vlcks burg where the railroads do not own and control the river fronts and bridges. Is It a wonder that naviga tion declines when corporations act through legislatures and other sources In grabbing these sites?" Mr. McGee dealt in figures of fabu lous proportions, showing that the po tential water power In the rivers of the country, If developed through widening and deepening, would within a few years pay for the work.
