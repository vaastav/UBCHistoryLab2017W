Varied Views In Congress on j Hardinsf Labor Recommendations, Seen to Point to National? ization of 'Kansas Indus? trial Court, Cause Stir Big Program of Work Co-operative Marketing Plan Meets Approval of Manv: Also Relief for Russia ?Yo*n Th? T-?fc?ne'9 TTo?MfK7?on JBure?* WASHINGTON, Dec 6.?President llarding's annual messag? to th? two houses of Congress to-day gave rise to varied comment among Senators and House members. On the whole, tho message was strongly approved by Republicans. By the same token the Democrats found much to criticize in it. Some of the high tariff Republicans of the old school, however, were ob? viously in doubt about the President's plans for n flexible tariff and thero was a disposition among members of the agricultural "bloc" not to take weU the observation of the President on divi? sions "according to pursuits." Tho recommendations concerning labor, which, as some expressed it, seemed to point to nationalizing the "Kansas Industrial Court idea, caused a ?tir and developed support as we?l as opposition. Senator Stanley, of Ken? tucky, Democrat, declared the Presi? dent was "playing with fire" and that it looked to him as if "compulsory ar? bitration is intended." Senator Poindexter, of Washington, Republican, on tho other hand, heartily indorsed M-hat the President said as to labor and once moro declared himself in favor of taking steps to prevent strikes, especially in the field of trans? portation. Fletcher for Marine Proposals The President's recommendations as to the merchant marine did not go into the subject of subsidy in a way to bring much reaction. With respect to the recommendation for repeal of that part of the Jones act intended to pave the way to discriminating duties, it was noticeable that Senator Fletcher, of Florida. Democrat, and former chairman of tho Commerce Committee, declared his "entire approval" of that part of the message, us well as what the President, said on agricultural mat? ters. Among the comments of Senators ?rere: Senator McNary, of Oregon, Repub? lican--! was pleased with the recom? mendation on reclamation and I agree with the President on labor. I am not sure just how scientific is the recommendation on tariff, but it may do as an experiment. Senator Heflin, of Alabama, Demo? crat?The suggestion that the ex-sol? dier-- must wait for adjusted compen? sation on the irrigation of arid lands will not bo very comforting to them or to their families. Senator Edge, of New Jersey, Repub iiean?Two points, in my judgement, stood out most prominently and chould meet universal approval. One was his frank, emphatic declaration that Amer? ica's interest in international prob? lems was unescapablc and that our own future compelled America's co-opera? tion; the other his suggestion of an elastic tariff to meet present abnormal trade and economic conditions strikes me as the only solution, both from a standpoint of protection at home and trade abroad. Speech Indictment, Says Harrison Senator Harrison, Democrat?The message, as a whole, was an indictment of the President's party in the Con? gress. When he said that he did not agree with some of the things that Congress had done he evidently had in mind the failure of some progressive Republicans to follow his load and suggestions in relieving wealth from its just share of the burdens of taxa? tion. Senator Brandegce. of Connecticut, Republican?-The recommendations are pound and practicable and if they are followed out will lead the country to great prosperity. Senator Poindexter, Republican?A very able message and very responsive to the needs of the world. It gives Congress a big program to work upon. The suggestions as to labor legislation aro very sound in principle. I agree that a strike, especially in transporta? tion, is just as destructive as open warfare. It ought to be controlled by the public within reasonable limits, just a*s you would control a man who gets out in the street with pistols to settle his grievances by force. Senator Frelinghuysen, Republican? I am not prepared to accept the Presi? dent's suggestion on the tariff without ?riving tho matter further thought. Apart from what he says as to the tariff, it is a very constructive mes? sage. Senator Townsend, Republican?A very excellent message. It shows the broad spirit the President has on all theso matters. Ho has been able to - lit hi3 mind to the desperate condi? tions of the rest of the world. It is a dream of a better world and of bet? ter conditions in our own country. Senator Capper. Republican, end member of the agricultural "bloc"?I was more particularly impressed with hla very Btrong statement as to agri? cultural conditions. I was especially pleased with his hearty approval of the co-operative movement. 1 AT S There are occa? sions when a pobbsDerbyis indispensable

Senator Curtis, Republican ? Taken all together, it. was a very fine mes? sage. There are one or two matters in it to which I desire to give further study." Although comment in tho House varied greatly, even within the party lines, the general tone was extremely enthusiastic. Majority Leader Mondell declared it to be a masterpiece, un? usual in its frankness and candor. "There runs through the entiro mes? sage a marked and remarkable spirit of cordial co-operation." he said. "I am complete.lv token with what the President said?with tho whole tenor, thought and spirit. He did not at? tempt to cover all the problems of the nation and ho frankly said no."
