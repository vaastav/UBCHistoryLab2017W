SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1908.— FIVE PARTS.— FIFTY-EIGHT PACiKS. NEW. POST FOR MAGOON? Believed That He Will Be Governor General of Philippines. [From Tho Tribune Bureau.] "Washington, Dec. 19.— 1t Is regarded In inner circles In Washington as practically settled that Judge Charles E. Maroon, now Provisional Gov ernor of Cuba, -will be requested by the Presi dent-elect to accept the office of Governor Gen eral of the Philippines. Governor Ma goon's present tour of duty ■will end with the inaugura tion of President Gomez, on February 28, and he will come north immediately. He hag now been practically four years a resident of the tropics, having been Governor of Panama before going to Cuba, and he has filled both positions -w ith exceptional ability. For this reason he is re- K;ir<l.-.1 as likely to make an exceptional success in the position of Governor General of the Phil ippines, and Mr. Taffs deep and abiding in terest in the Islands -will insure the selection for ihat important office of a man with special qualifications and attainments. It is regarded as probable that Judge M:ig«'»on will be permitted to take a considerable r^st before ( nteiing upon the duties of his new post, and it is not improbable that he will be sent on some foreign mission In Xorthecii latitudes i>^ for<* going- again to the tropics. The present Governor General of the Philip pine?, Judge Smith, is anxious to receive an ap pointment to the federal bench In this country, and it is assumed that he will be nominated for 6urh office by the future President whenever Judge Jbgnon is prepared to relieve him. Judge Magoon has been frequently mentioned for the portfolio of "War in President Taft's Cabinet, and that he may ultimately attain that position is regarded as not at aJI imprubable. The present Indications are. however, that Sec retary "Wright will remain in the Cabinet for a time, perhaps throughout Judge Magoon's ex pected incumbency as Governor General of the Philippines. The friends of George yon 1.. Meyer, now Postmaster General, believe that he will suc ceed Mr. Xewberry as Secretary of the Navy, and it is freely intimated that sooner or later William Loeb, jr., secretary to the President, will be offered the portfolio of Commerce and Labor. 

MASQUERADED AS MAN. Strange Adventures of Girl Ac cused of Robbing Own Room. Cedar Rapids, lowa, Dec. 3C». — A young wom an, masquerading as a man. and telling a strange story of adventures, with which a mur^ der commitgsd two yeara ago in Philadelphia may be connected, was arrested here I under the name of Earl Waters. The authorities arrested "Waters" "for rob \ itiet ■'his'" own room and filing a complaint the police Then they discovered "Waters" to be a girl, apparently about eighteen years old. She says she doea not know her own name, unless It Is "Pearl "Waters." She says she was born in Europe, and that her earliest recollections are of life in New York. A woman with whom she lived was abusive, and four yean ag-o tho sir! do:;ned a boy's suit and left her. At Philadelphia she 'ell in with a youns man, 1 .oi lining his companion, though she did not reveal her sex. She says he became involved in a quarrel, committed murder and that they fled. They came to Cedar Rapids two years ago, since which time both have been employed as newsboys on trains. Philadelphia, Dec. 19.— The Philadelphia police havo no record of "Earl Waters," who was ar r^sted in Cc-Tlar Rapids. lowa, to-day. Several unsolved murder mysteries confront the Phil ia police, notably that of Dr. Wilson, who waa killed by drinking a bottle of poisoned ale which was pent him by express. Superintendent Taylor, however, pays that the woman arrested at fedar Rapids could not have been Involved in that murder. FOR CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.

BROKER SHOT IN OFFICE INVENTOR, AFTER MONET, FIRES AT 11. B. SUYD AM. Vproar on Curb, and Prisoner, Who Pleads Self -Dc fence, Is Threat ened — Victim Mmy Die. Harry B. Suydam, a curb broker, with ar of fice at Xo. SS Broad street and living at No 141 Clinton avenue, PlalnfieUl, X. J. was shot It h!3 I office yesterday morning by John C. Lumnlen, a Southern Inventor, who says Suydam and others defrauded him out of his life's -work. Mr. Buydain was taken to the Hudson Paioct ; Hospital, where it was said last night there was I little hope for his recovery. Not in many months has there been so much excitement In the finan cial district as that caused yesterday by the f shooting, and Lumsden would have fared badly I at tha hands of the infuriated curb brokers had it not been for the prompt arrival of the re serves of the John street station under the com mand'uf Captain Hogan. It was shortly after the opening of the .- Exchange that Lumsden appeared at Mr. Suy dam's office, telling the doorman that he wasted towee Mr. Saydam himself^ and that if be was not In he would wait for him. The office f wee paid little attention to him, as he had been in th.' office before aud was known to a!l of them by sight. A few minutes after Lumsden's arrival Mr. Suydam appeared, and after greeting Ma employes turned to Lumsden with a hearty "Good morning. Take off your coat." Lumsdsn, according to the employe?;, took off his overcoat and laid it on a table, say Mr. Suydam at the" same tim^: "I don't want to sit down, but I do wani to see you in private." SUYDAM CRIES FOR HELP. Mr. Suydam walked to the window and I.v Ba den followed him. The two stood in sight of | those in the adjoining offices and street qnd j talked together for several minutes, no one pay ing any especial attention to them. Sudd> uly - Mr. Sirydam swung around and snouted to George A. Downs, a clerk in the office: "For God's sake, George, tako this man away I or ho will kill me." Downs jumped to his feet and ran toward the window where the two men stood glaring at each other, but Lumsden was too quick for him. i Drawing a revolver from hfrs pocket Lums leu fired two shots at close range. In a moment I the office and that part of Broad street in front of the building was in an uproar, for the shots could bo heard plainly in the street. Downs hurled Lumsden against the wall and prevented him from using tlto weapon again, while others ; in the office ran for help. Patrolmen John J. | Corcoran and Beaton were the first to reach i the room, and there they found Downs holding on to his prisoner, while hundreds of the ten anta of the building were collecting in front of i the office, fighting to %*t in. Mr. Suydam was staggering toward a window, gasping for .ilr. One shot had tak> n effect near his heart, while 1 the other pierced the right lung and upper lobe 1 of the liver. Corcoran and Beaton, realizing the serious ness of the case, sent in a hurry call for an ambulance from the Hudson Street Hospital and another for th© police reserves. Because of the excitement it was almost impossible for the police to learn who did the shooting until Mr. Suydam rallied enough to point to Lumsden and cry: "That man shot me for a reason I do not know!" Shortly after making this statement he be came exhausted and lapsed Into unconscious ness. CROWD THREATENS PRISONER. After the arrival of the ambulance it was some time before the police attempted to take the prisoner to the station house. The crowd in front of t'.ie building had grown to groat proportions, and many threats of violence were hurled at the prisoner. All ports of rumors were afloat regarding the shooting, and little business was transacted for a time. With the arrival of the reserves police lines were formed from the office to the street, and the prisoner, calm and collected, was # placed in the patrol wagon and hurried to the station house, wit] a crowd chasing the wagon. At the station bouse Lumsden gave 1. as thirty-one years, and said be lived at No. i>l3 West 57th street. .He showed little emo tion. He asked for a. drink of water, and when tills was given to him he turned to Captain Hogan and made the following statement: "Suydam owed me $650, and has owed it foi ;t long time, ami 1 needed the money. He gave me notes for money which he had raised on col lateral which 1 had given him.

While Lumsden was talking to Captain Hogan Downs, who was greatly attached to liis cin r, could scarcely contain his emotioi turning to Lieutenant Kenny he remarked: "It's a good thing for that man that he is under the protection of the p SUYDAM MAKES STATEMENT.

Leading Senators Not If 'tiling to Undertake Work — Cou ntry Supporting Mr. Roosevelt. [From The Tribune Bureau] 'Washington, Dec. 19— That rebuking the President, or even conducting an Investigation of that portion of the administration devoted to the prosecution of violations of the federal statutes. Is a particularly hazardous undertak ing, and one which few legislators care to undertake, is becoming daily more obvious to the Senate leaders. It is appreciated that un less the Intended Investigation is conducted by men of character It will be without force or ef fect, while experience Is daily demonstrating that practically no such Senator is anxious to undertake the work. Correspondence is coming to Senators in large volume, the tenor of which adds emphasis to the dangerous character of the proposed action. Senator Hale maintains that as chairman of i the Committee on Naval Affairs and acting chairman Of the Committee on Appropriations, he is too heavily burdened to assume the chair manship of the sub-committee to which he would delegate the proposed investigation. Senator Cullom is hardly strong enough to do much extra work, and he is now in charge of the sub-committee which is considering and must i soon report the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill. Senator GalUnger has a ' fight for re-election on his hands, and has al i ready left here for his state to rally Ins politi ! cal forces. This leaves, among the Republican | members Of the Committee on Appropriations, only Senators Perkins, . Elkins, Warren and Hemenway. It seems probable that Messrs. Warren and Hemenway will bo drafted, but Messrs. Perkins and Elkins are n-»t regarded as 1 especially suitable material for an investigation I committee: Mr. Hemenway is n<-aring the end of his term, and as the Indiana Legislature will i be Democratic, he has no political life to risk, but Mr. Warren is regarded by many as too friendly to the administration t" bring in the sort of report they would iike. Altogether, the situation is the occasion of perplexity and anxiety to the Senate leaders. 'l*here seems to be little doubt that Senator Teller, as ranking Demociat, will be chosen, and it is possible that Senator Tillman, the next ranking member, will be the other Democrat, but some of the Republicans object to serving with Mr. Tillman because of his eccentricities of method and speech. Most of the members of the Senate would be entirely satisfied to intrust to Mr. Teller the conduct of the entire investiga tion, but. of course party pride would make that impossible. That the country is rot in sympathy with the attitude of Congress toward the President's message is evident from the letters Senators are receiving. For instance, one Senator received to-day a letter which read In part: "Nothing could help an honest Senator more than now to demonstrate his integrity in pro tecting popular rights and public property by standing by the President. No explanation will serve as an e*cuse for any attack upon that great and sincere cham't|ua of the people Any thing else they will cou. t as secret hostility to their interests." Another Senator has received a letter from a constituent, which is, in part, as follows: "I can assure you that I am by nn means the only one of your constituents In this state who will resent as nn indignity which can only be- Uttle the standing of the Senate any official criticism concerning a rebuke so justly deserved and so fearlessly expressed." Many hundreds of similar communications are reaching Senators every' day, and one pajnm- Inent leader said, sadly, this afternoon, that If this kind of "popular shower" kept up there would bo "nobody left on Appropriations except 'Jim' Hemenway and 'Steve' Elkins who will dare und rUtke the Investigation."
