According to Post Office Department estimates, the American people who use the mails lost during the past fiscal year no less than $423,000 through carelessness in their failure to address their letters. This is the fault not merely of those who wrote t heir addresses illegibly or incorrectly, but those who dropped into the mail boxes letters and packets without any directions at all. No less than 140,000 letters were thus posted "blind." In addition 16.5S0.419 letters reached the dead letter office as a result of careiess addressing, and more than 60O.OOO liarcels failed of delivery from this cause. No wonder the Post Office Department enjoins the people who use the mails to "be careful." Safety first should be the rule. The post office does a remarkable work in deciphering and delivering badly addressed mail matter, but there are limits be yona wmcn it cannot go. -mere are .scrawls that even the most expert ol the deciphering squad cannot interpret. There are geographical mistakes that puzzle the most ingenious and imaginative of the dead letter force. In the case of the unaddressed mail it is finally necessary to open it. tc determine if possible the name and address of the writer. This expedient is always undesirable, because one ol the first principles of the p-'Stal service is to respect the sanctity of mail matter. At this season of ihe year it is especially important that all who use the mails should be careful. Christmas presents and greetings are posted in enormous volume, and in the conges lion that results the danger of misdeliveries is increased. Careful mail users place upon their posted matter, both letters and packages, their own names and addresses, so ihat in case <>f failure of delivery return can foe made to them. Only a small per rentage, however, of the users of the ;>ost do this, and the dead letter office tlnds its burden increased in consequence. 1'ncle Sam carries the people's mail with remarkable precision and expedition, but he cannot render fully efficient service if the people themselves are careless. Co-operation is necessary, and the least that can be expected of those who use the post la that they afford a fair chance of correct handling through legible addressing. Certainly there is no excuse for putting unaddresscd mail Into the I'nelo Sam as a n aulas' participant in the IJ nwinnc conference might rei eive less alert and deferential consideration than lie jtets in his present position. There are doubts as to whether the "sick man of Europe" Is regaining strength or falling into greater delirium. The President's Program. Test jrday The Star commented upon the President's message with especial reference to the. remedies which he pi aposes to cure transp 'ation evils. Cot sidcration of the transpo ation problem flows naturally into consideration of the problems of the farmer, and the problems of the farmer into those of the consuming public. Present difficulties of the farmer, the President finds, are due chiefly to the unevenness of deflation from war-time price levels and to the inequities of transportation charges. From the latter of these causes the consumers of farm products suffer along with the producers. Alreadv a eood deal has been done for the relief of agriculture, and the President recommends that temporary improvement In credit facilities should lie made permanent. But he recognizes that this alone is not sufficient to reach the fundamental difficulties of the farmer. Cheaper and better transportation, he Insists, is necessary to permanent and deserved agricultural good fortune. And he would have a searching inquiry made into the unwarranted "spread" in prices between the producer and consumer, tc the end that ways may be devised \ whereby the farmer will receive more of what the consumer pays and the onsumer pay less for what the farmer grows. Better respect for the law is demanded by the President, not otaly from aliens, but from Americans at welL He believes the contempt in which so many citizens hold the prohibition enforcement law is a demoralizing example to newly-arrived e- nnla tka4 U theeatne. 4e HI migi nil LOf auu UK?k ?IU VwivilD it undermine tha very foundations of the republic. He thinks it unlikely the eighteenth amendment ever will be repealed, and he doubts if the legislation enacted for Its enforcement is < ontrary to the wishes of a majority <>f the people. If it is contrary to the popular will, he argues that rigorous and literal enforcement is the way to concentrate public attention on any requisite modification, and he calls upon all good citizens to suppcrt the government in such a program. ^9 this is added the announcement that he purpoaes summoning at as ? early day a conference of governors to . seek better co-operation between state and federal agencies In enforcement of the law. Whatever personal opln ion may be as to the wisdom of the Volstead act. that act Is the law of f the land, and "every good American will applaud the President's Arm ret solve that the law shall be respected. Illiteracy, Immigration and child labor are other subjects which the President urges upon the serious attention of Congress. While recognlz' lng that education of youths is pri' marily the function of the states, he i conceives It to be the duty of the fed ' eral government to iook aner anens who are admitted to our shores. He urges passage of pending bills for the registration of aliens and the estab! lishment of examining boards abroad to weed out undesirables at the source. Then he would have the federal government devise means and effectively assist in the education of the newcomers, so that the level of American education may be made the highest that is humanly possible, i The President sees a close relatlon; ship between the problems of education and child labor. As the Supreme Court has twice held that legislation for the regulation of child labor is outi side the province of Congress, he recommends submission to the states of an amendment to the Constitution 1 giving Congress the authority it lacks. In the President's review of our 1 foreign relations much is to be found ! to gratify Americans and to provide. ' food for thought to the statesmen and . ;_i?*-it . * -..v.-- "T uniiH lllliauiiauis Ul UUICl lanuo, * nwu<? 1 j like the Congress and the people of ! the nation to believe," he says, "that '! in a Arm and considerate way we are 1 > insistent upon American rights wher: ever they may be questioned, and ! deny no rights of others in the asserI lion of our own." He insists that we i have shirked no duty which comes of 1 j sympathy or fraternity or highest feli lowship among nations, and that every ' obligation consonant with American ideals and sanctioned under our form of government is willingly met. ' And, in conclusion: "We ask no one to assume responsibility for us; we assume no responsibility which others ' must bear for themselves, unless na| tionality is hopelessly swallowed up in internationalism." On the whole, the President's message is an able state paper, refreshing 1 j for its stalwart Americanism and I valuable for Its clear thinking at a j time when there is so much muddled ' i thought in the world. Also it is note' j worthy because of the high political ; courage it manifests, for some of the j things he recommends are bound to ! bring down upon his head a storm of J criticism. One thing else it makes | clear. However much he may have | appeared to have slackened the reins ! in the past. President Harding Is the ' leader of his party today. He has stepped firmly Into that position by giving his party the one thing It conspicuously lacked?a program. By that program now the republican party, no less than the President, must stand or fall. 11 | America might he of assistance to j Europe if some practical program ; could be evolved permitting reference ' of the Dardanelles question to the rivers and harbors committee. If the claims of medical science as to prolonging human life continue to develop, the old story of Dr. Faustus and Mephisto will be due for revision in a modern setting. There Is not much encouragement In the theory that eo long as various ! military experts regard another war 'ns inevitable the V. S. A. might as i well get in early. 1 i I.egal authority has its limitations. I There is no way 01 securing an injunction to prevent the thermometer from dropping in the presence of a coal shortage. Fighting in Ireland has acquired a momentum which even under new conditions it will take time to overcome. Having proved that England is not boss, the people of Ireland will proceed to decide among themselves who is. The People's Parks. An increase of 44.493 persons visiting the national parks of this country during the past fiscal year over the year previous is a most gratifying indication that the people of the United States are coming to appreciate the remarkable advantages which these federal reservations offer to them. The total attendance In the parks was 1,216.490, 60 per cent of these people traveling In their own motors. More than two-thirds of these motor tourists j camped out in the parks. No wonder j the director of the national park serv ice in his annual report says that "it i is obvious that the parks are among the most popular Institutions fostered by the government." Not only did these 1,216,490 people enjoy the natural wonders for the preservation of which the parks have been created, but in reaching them i they traveled considerable distances, s many of them crossing the continent. - The travel entailed thus amounted to i hundreds of millions of miles. In no I other way, probably, could so many Americans have been made acquainted with the country, with its vast extent, its great variety of features and re sources. Such travel is certain to make for good citizenship, for a feeling of parti nership in the most wonderful country i in the world, for greater loyalty to American Institutions. These visits to the national parka, I moreover, were health-giving. Accord> lng to the director's estimates, nearly OvU.vvV Jiwirav MMJiyvw vub ill UiO |?riU during the fl?cal year, and they were undoubtedly benefited physically by this experience. With the constant increase In motoring It is likely that a much greater number will In the course of the current fiscal year undertake this method of park visiting. Facilities have been provided In the parks for camping, and every inducement has been offered to the people to take advantage of then. In consequence a transcontinental tour by motor, with the parks as the main objective, comes within the means of many who have heretofore been debarred from such an experience by considerations of expense. The wise policy of preserving the natural wonders of this continent and making them accessible to the people is thus being constantly vindicated by the response of the public to the advantages afforded. A few years ago it was necessary to "sell" the parks as objects of visitation, to use a commercial phrase. But now, as a result of efficient work by the park service, the series of scenic splendors and inspiring areas of Interest has been made known to practically every person in this country, and opportunity only is waiting for visiting them. America's Fire Waste. , Astoria, Oreg., furnishes the latest example of American wastefulness through Are. Flames have swept through that city taking a toll of $15,000,000 in destroyed property, covering twenty-seven blocks. Fortunately no Uvea were lost directly, and not as many people were rendered homeless as in other conflagrations which have swept residential sections. Still it was an appalling loss, and the more so as doubtless investigation will prove it to be due to a careless cause?neglect of some simple rule of protection and prevention. At Newbern, X. C., recently a Are caused destruction of property valued , at fu.DDV.vw, mill rcuuerru mmiy Hundreds homeless. In that case investigation indicates incendiarism and an amazing slackness on the part of the flre-ilghting forces, suggestive of a willingness that the flames should sweep unchecked. Flimsy construction caused the mounting of the loss. From the beginning of this year, as the records of news dispatches show, fires have been raging in all parts of the United States with tremendous losses. Destruction of less than $100,000 scarcely attracts attention. Now it is an office building, again a department store, or an apartment house or hotel, an industrial plant, or a series of buildings, or an area of residences. In some cases the heart of a city is destroyed. At the present rate the losses in this country from flames will 4*% $>i!a <>aa* 1 AO*) eraatar tho n attar save, perhaps, in some year of a holocaust like that of Chicago, Boston, Baltimore or San Francisco. In 1921 New York city's losses from Are were $15,000,009 greater than in 1920. And yet the Are department of that city is constantly being developed, as ate those of other municipalities. Better apparatus, more highly-trained men, abundance of water seem to make no difference in the matter of keeping down this waste. Fires start with small beginnings and gain headway before discovery or check. Concentration of values is attributable in great measure to this steadily mounting loss in terms of billions. Better construction should always follow such a Are as that in Astoria. Better construction should precede, indeed, but it seems to take a disaster to teach this lesson. Constant inspection is necessary, with severe penalties for violation of Are-prevention rules. Washington lias one paramount need in this respect. It should have a high-pressure water service, to insure the business district against heavy loss. Such a system, whatever it may cost, is made essential by the examples or ouier dues uiat are swept bj flames. The immunity of the capital from heavy destruction thus far does not guarantee against a disaster of unmeasurahle magnitude In the future. Husband killers have beoome so numerous that the promise to love, honor and obey in the marriage rerej mony may be superseded by a simple request not to shoot. Events continue to call attention to the fact that as compared with most International assemblages the Washington conference got a remarkable amount of action. If every proposed amendment were to be adopted the United States Constitution would become almost as unwieldy as the treaty of Versailles. Berlin extravagance is attributed to the desire of paper mark owners to get rid of them while there Is still something they will buy. The country to dry, with a certain amount of seepage which the authorities will endeavor to correct.

In a letter to a Florida editor? written probably In responae to one received;?Woodrow Wilson recently aid: The task of 1924 Is to so mobilize our intellectual and moral forces as to assure a complete defeat of the party which has done the country so serious a disservice ana to win again for our government the leadership in the affairs of the world which the republicans for the time being have deprived It. and personally I feel confident this can and will be done. My pulses are quickened by the prospect of battle. Mr. Wilson keeps In touch with his friends all over the country. Now from this, now from that, section, a letter on the subject of politics written by Mr. Wilson to some admirer finds Its way into print. The recipient Is always proud of his good fortune, and willing that the public shall share the missive with him. It was in this way that Mr. Cleveland, between March, 1889, when he retired from the White House, until the meeting time of the democratic national convention In the summer of 1892, largely occupied himself. He conducted a voluminous correspondence with admirers?many of whom he had never seen?on the subject of the democracy's future, uttering cheering words. The result was that at that convention sentiment for Mr. Cleveland was | overwncimingly strong, and he was nominated, hands down, for another? his third?try at the presidency. Mr. Wilson can hardly have a thought of heading his party's ticket himself In 1924, but It is most likely that he desires a voice in the choosing of the man. and in the construction of the platform on which the candidate shall stand. And letters in line with the one this Floridlan has just received will serve that purpose well. With ample leisure, and interest in politics keen, Mr. Wilson, from his residence in this town, can make his influence felt In every state in the Union. And Florida, it may not be unimportant to remember, is now the home state of William J. Bryan, who also, alert as at all times, is giving more or less attention to 1924. Foreign and Domestic Wets. The drys are not oblivious to the fact that the wets in their efforts for the control of Congress have the sympathy of large interests in France and i Spain and Italy. I The wine-makers in those countries ! ' are desirous of regaining a market in ! j America. When they had it they i | profited greatly. Since its loss they ) Jackson, then, is the man.

Chairman Hull, a Tennesaean, proposes for January 8, 1923, the well known and oft-repeated toast, Andrew Jackson. The President's Thanksgiving proclamation is soon followed by a message to Congress indicating a number of things for which we may hope to be thankful a year hence. Publlo interest shifts rapidly. By this time people who collected "reUcs" at : Hew Brunswick are beginning to wonder what they wanted with them. A a. ''f"-- .-v v have found a big hole in their incomes. The situation has been thoroughly canvassed. Visitors from abroad have been taking "the lay of the land" and reporting to their principals at home. They are still on the Job, and advised by their American friends that hard work, and plenty of it, is ahead: that the grade cannot l>e easily made. Will this sympathy take practical form of some kind? Will it be possible for these foreign interests to do anything in America for the general good of the order? If anything of the sort is attempted it will have to be done with skill and care. There is not the old-time sensitiveness in this country about foreign interference with our domestic affairs. Since the war closed we have heard a good deal from Europe on the subject of how we should conduct our affairs, and especially so as to minister to Europe's woes. America has been rechrlstened Altruria, and abundant advice received as to making our conduct square with a complete re- j nunciation of self. !

Jackson Day. On the suggestion of Chairman Hull of the democratic national committee the coming Jackson day will be celebrated throughout the country with dinners, eaten In memory of Old Hickory and as an Inspiration to the best party endeavors In 1924. I When It comes to the rank and file, Jackson holds over Jefferson. The latter was a sage, and played the part to perfection. He had learning, and was of a speculative disposition. He was In character and at his best at Montlcello, after the fret of office and action was over. He reveled In his library, and entertained what In that day was called "carriage company" to the queen's taste. The perfect highbrow, if you please. Jackson was not a lowbrow, in any sense. But he was more-sided than Jefferson, and touched the everyday at more points. He was a man of action as well as of thought?was soldier, lawyer, statesman, politician, man of the crowd, all In one. In camp planning and In the field fighting; at the political council table advising as to policies; on the race track inspecting the "ponies" and picking winners, he was equally at home and deferred to. Old Hickory at the Hermitage, spent and awaiting the end, was not as happy or impressive as Jefferson : had been at Montlcello. Conduct of Chi Deters Growtl BY 

THOMAS H. MARSHALL. Fanur YTUse FnaUnl ( O* CalM State*. IN the midst of abounding prosperity or under the stress of adverse circumstances It Is quite natural that the religious sentiments of a people taken as a whole should be found at ebb tide. Outward and visible observance of the regular ordinances of the church continues, but it comes to be largely perfunctory. We, mumble our creeds and we glibly repeat our prayers, but the real religion which made the creed and wrote the prayer ceases to have much of a hold upon us, and still less upon our conduct. However, we must not lay this entirely at the feet of Immediate circumstances. Civilisation is slow of growth and faith In a religion Is long In dying. The times simply accentuate the spiritual condition. In contemplation of the things that are taking place In the near east, and to a lesser extent In the far east. It Is to be remembered that there are to be found men the world around who are pointing the finger of scorn at' Christianity. They are saying that tried as a cure for the Ills of the world It has proven a failure. Pointing out that most of the nations engaged in the world war wptp Christian nations, they are mocking: "See how these Christians hated each other, how each in the name of the Nazarene killed and pillaged." If any one of the nations waged the war with the approval of Jehovah, how could any other nation have waged the same war with similar pretentions, they Inquire, adding queries like these: "Is this God in whom you say you believe a divisible being, part of Him with one of the contending forces and part of Him with the other?" "fan you Ktr'k? blown at each other in the belief and with the assurance that the blows ar?? struek in a righteous cause with the approval of a righteous ruler of the universe?" Questions. such as these, are vexing and unsettling the religious faith of mankind. * * * * If It were possible to establish that the war was waged with real religious sentiment behind rtt there would bo much to Justify the oncer that curls upon the lip of the average man when we avow our faith In the principles of the Christian religion. lie would have some right to suspect that we were Insincere. But Christianity waited no war. made no fight. Hostile nations may have had. in truth did have, rulers who believed in Christ, and millions of men In arms under these rulers may have had. and did have, a like faith, but the war of the world was not produced by the faith of the Gallltan. It was not waited with His knowledge and consent. It did not exemplify the principles which He sought to instill into men as their guide posts along the journey of life. Laughed at by authority and sneered at by philosophy, just as the Savior was persecuted, despised and rejected of men. Christianity, nevertheless, permeated tho Roman empire. Insidiously yet powerfully. until (most remarkable of historic events) it became the religion of Rome without a single blow having been struck. That disclosed what Christianity can accomplish when prosecuted in accordance with tits ideas of its founder. Xot by might nor by power, not by sword nor submarine. but by the invisible spirit, it achieves its mission among men and nations. Likewise with liberty. Neither liberty nor Christianity id a benefaction that can be bestowed upon an Individual or a people. Each la a birth from within and must be given Its opportunity to develop. * * * The alow growth of Christian missions In the orient has led hundreds of good people to believe that tlie effort to christianize the cast is a vain and futile one. They say that the oriental mind is not fitted for the reception of Christian teaching. They object, therefore. to what they call the waste of money in this efTort. These good persons must not forget that many young men of the east are Foreign Trade IT ^WARRANTED repudiation of I contracts In foreign trade Is J a growing menace and the establishment of some fed- | era! agency that will issno certificates J of examination attesting; conformity i of shipment with samples Is proposed to relieve the situation and aid in building up commercial honor. Mercantile circles In many lands are ' considering this problem and its solu- J tion Is of vital Importance to foreign trade. A. J. Wolfe, chief of the division or commercial law of the United States bureau of foreign and domestic commerce, points out. Enlightened merchants of the principal commercial nations, who recognise the sacredness of commercial honor, are seeking to eliminate the evil of unwarranted contract repudiation based on specious pleas, and to facilitate an equitable adjustment of complaints that are justified. It has been pointed out by men high In commercial circles and stressed In conferences with officials of the Department of Commerce that It would be a fine thing If buyers and sellers were to agree that the certificate of examination by some authorised agency, showing conformity of goods shipped with the samples on which the order waa based, should be regarded as final and as rendering al subsequent complaint Impossible. ! The Department of Commerce has been entertaining the proposal that a start be made with certain commodities and with countries In which commercial discipline has attained a high standard. It la patent that the agency passing upon the shipment would have to enjoy the confidence of both parties to the sales contract? ?H* huvof and aaltar. It la a severe teat of both to abide by the consequence of a bargain that eventually proves unprofitable. It Is comparatively easy to do So when conditions are normal or better. But when all about him failures, crises and uncertainties shake the structure of business and undermine prosperity, the merchant must be upheld by a sense of integrity, by a positive public opinion in the mercantile community and by a knowledge that the other party to the contract, while in no way responsible for the situation which has arisen, sympathises with him and is willing, voluntarily, - him ail th# moral suooort needed. A card index of commercial honor ia kept by the export director of one of the foremoat .American international merchandising concerns. On white cards he keeps the names of those who honor their signature to a contract at all costs. The custom of those foreign houses is Jealously guarded and there is nothing in the way of accommodation they mar ask for that is denied them.

The recent exhibition of a collection of "Beadles* dime novels" at the public library attracted many students of history who defended their interest in these old thrillers on the ground that they recorded the deeds of such American pioneers as Daniel Boone. Kit Carson and Buffalo Bill. Some of those dime novels at sales have brought as much as $60 ea<*h. At a sale just ended at the Anderson Galleries amazingly high prices were paid for original material relating to the early west. $290 was paid for Aldricli's "Overland to California." $:??0 for a '*oj?y ??f th?* Weekly Pad fie News printed on wrapping paper. $400 for a Mormon tra- t and $500 for an 1*22 document on colonizing Texas.

A YEAR or so ago there was a fad for Chinese food and a chop stiey place at Columbus Circle was parked every night, but recently the vogue is for things Russian and Hawaiian. One of the season's debutantes, eager * o do something: novel, entertained her friends at a Hawaiian restaurari in the West Forties, where, in rooin^ decorated with wreaths of lei, curr of chicken, Hawaii style, was served as a Hawaiian orchestra played. Two Russian restaurants that serve cabbage soup and the odd little ifanoake are also much patronized, the vogu* for things Russian having been emphasized by tiie presence in Nov York of many Russians of culture and the success of the ^'hauve Souris theater.

With Johnnie and Ray Do?>ley in the cast there were some amusing acrobatic moments, and the cast included such favorites as Fred and Adele Astaire and the Brown Brothers with their saxophones.

In the course of his remarks at the exercises Mr. J.
