VOL. XXXIV. NO. 73. SPURNS OFFER OF FREEDOM Girl Prefers Prison to Separation from Her Sweetheart Declines Proffered Bail Unless Lover Is Also Given Liberty Beautiful Young Girl of Oakland, Who Eloped to Los Angeles, Com. posedly Talks of Her Troubles Prison walls with the man she loves, or"o r" the right to go free while he re mained behind the bars. These were the alternative! which yesterday confronted ECatelle Cunning ham! the seventeen-year-old girl who eloped from Oakland Saturday with Harry H. Holly and who was arrested ln company with him Monday' night In Los Angeles. • v ';,-. Early yesterday morning Mr. and Mrs. David W. Cunningham of 627 West Eighteenth .street called at the city jail and were admitted to see Miss Cunningham. They offered her hail If she would go with them, but they would not do the same for her lover, and rather than accept that which was not extended him the girl declared she would stay In jail. Quite Self Possessed She was sitting. In the matron's room last night with Lulu Grlggs, the girl ■who is accused of accepting a bribe to leave Paris, Mo., so that she would not bc present at the trial of a man who ls said to have deserted his wife and family to run away with her. They were talking quietly when I en tered with the matron. Neither of the girls was as I expected to see her. Miss Cunningham, who is a beautiful gill and would be considered attractive ln.', any room full of .'pretty women, turned as the matron called her nainer and a tight line around her lips be : came a little' more firm. She greeted mcm me 'with composure such as few wo men of twice her age could command/ "You .want to see me?. I am sorry, but I have really nothing to say," and she tossed her head a little to one side. "Now that you are here I will see you, but I did not want to say anything more. " I began by telling people what was really the truth, but It was misunder stood and now I will say nothing. "Whatever Is the truth will come out some day, and if it does not, it cannot bc helped. "Yes, I refused to be released today because Mr. Holly had to stay here. If they had been willing to ball him out I would have gone, but not otherwise. Determined to Marry "What am I going to do? It would bc foolish to say what lam going to do. It Is foolish for anyone to say. for things have to take their course. "When a girl makes up her mind to marry a man, she is as good as mar ried to him, in my mind. When my mmdm mind is made up it Is made up to stay. "No,' I really canot say why my mother objected to Mr. Holly. I do not know. When there are two sisters in the family the sisters are more apt to bc chums, and then one girl does not Confide in her mother quite as much as she might otherwise. "Yes, I know all Mr. Holly's people. ] 1 really could not say whether they wanted us to be married. We did not take into consideration whether or not anyone else wanted us to get married. "No,. I told no one that I was going to be married." / Pretty and Well Dressed The words were uttered quietly but determinedly and after each sentence the girl closed her lips firmly as If to say, "this will be the last." lt seemed hardly possible to Imag ine that she is only seventeen years of age. She was dressed in perfect, taste. Her hair, which is a beautiful shade of brown, was drawn back from her face in a soft pompadour, and her dark brown eyes were veiled beneath long lashes. Her gown, which con sisted of a. dark brown silk, made in good style, was the most becoming thing she could have chosen. There was nothing about her which would suggest anything but refinement. In all her refusals her tone was quiet, patient and determined. "People think I am much older, but you see how much good It did me," she said. "On the boat the friends I made guessed that I was twenty-four and twenty-five, but none of them ever thought I could be seventeen. "I" I have been out of school only a few months. I graduated at the Oak land high school last June. I have known Mr. Holly about four years. ! ' Admits Big Mistake ■■Yes, we made one big mistake. We should have been married sooner. If we had known that we could have been married on the boat it would have been all right, but we did not know. "No, 1 have not seen Mr. Holly since I came into the jail," and with that the girl's lips quivered, and the feel ing which she had been trying to hide came very near to.appearing on the surface. "Have you seen hit* picture? That Is the least 1 can do. I will show you that." and she pulled a tiny locket on a tiny gold chain from her dress. ' "The matron was so good—she went down stairs and got it for me today. I have worn it a long time. I wanted it." ' In these few wonts she expressed more feeling than the average girl would , put Into as many dozen. "1" 1 don't know how long we will have to stay here, but the matron is very good in u.s." .sin- continued. "No, I do not think my mother real lues what my position here Is, or she w to me this would not want keep way. (t'untluurii uu I'wk« Nlur., Los Angeles Herald. rniut. j r>,, Mnnm 1 00 LbNTS

Fletcher apparently stood in front of the mirror in the bureau and placed the revolver to his right eye. It is thought he fired the shot at 11 o'clock Tuesday morning, for at that time a report was heard, but as no noisa followed it, the roomers who heard it did not make an investigation. The bullet pierced his brain and it came out Just in front of the right ear. It is thought Fletcher was despond ent on account of ill health. He had been treating with physicians for sic iiii:n h trouble for some time. He was thirty-live years of age and Is thought to have been married. He came to Los Angeles three months ago and had made his home at tho place where he ended his life.

Adams, South 1207; Howard and Smith, Ninth and Olive, or Dr. S. S. Salisbury. REUBEN FLETCHER." This note was complied with and tho men spoken to stated that they were only slightly acquainted with Fletcher. They said he always appeared to be a man of means who was traveling for his health. Fletcher entered his room after It had been cleaned, about 10 o'clock Tuesday morning. It was unnecessary for the landlady to go. near It again during the day. Yesterday morning she endeavored to gain entrance for the purpose of cleaning it, but she. found the door locked. Last night she informed her husband and he at last succeeded In opening the door with a passkey. When ha turned on the light he found the body of Fletcher lying In front of the bureau, with his head in a pool of blood. The note he had writ ten was lying beside his' body. The Pistol which had been used was on the bureau and It was apparent that tho man had stood In front of the mirror when he aimed the weapon. The coroner was notified and an In quest will be held this morning. WILL MAKE PUBLIC METCALF'S REPORT Qy Associated Press.

ARGUE EIGHT-HOUR CASE United Railways Explain Why They Cannot Grant Shorter Hours to Men rt<- Associated Press. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 12.-^l dence to determine the difficulties con fronting the United railways in re habilitating its service after the fire was submitted this morning before tho board of arbitration that is hearing the demands of the men for shorter hours and more pay. B. D. Hibbs, general superintendent of the system, was the first witness on behalf of the company. He gave an elaborate statement which he had prepared in reference to the two sub jects of increase of work and increase of pay. This statement was submitted for the purpose of showing how many cars were operated before the fire and how many are in operation at tlje present time. He stated that in March the com pany had in operation 256 miles, while in July (three months after the fire) 182.86 miles were in operation. This left a decrease of 29 1-15 per cent, and the company contends that it replaced the heavier roads first, leaving the lighter traffic roads for later work. On this basis the company accounts for the natural increase of traffic on trie roads now being operated. He contended that the company could not afford to grant shorter hours to its men. Attorney A. A. Moore for the rail road company will begin his final ex amination of witnesses late this after noon.
