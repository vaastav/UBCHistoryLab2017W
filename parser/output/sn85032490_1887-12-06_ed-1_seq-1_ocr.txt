Dewey Ensign, the boy who was to be iu Kansas City February 5th, or loe a fortune has turned up in San Francisco. His father died re cently leaving an estate worth ?70,0C0. The son Dewey had run away to California instead o attending school and the en raged parent left a will with the following clause: I divide my estate equally be" tween my wife and my son. The latter, however, shall receive his share only on these conditions, six months, after my death this testament shall be opened by Frederick Ensign, my brother-in-law and Tames sharp of I.Os Angeles. If my son Dewey is present when the document is made public he shall receive his share. If he is not then it is my will that he shall be cut ofi" with the sum of ?10, and the estate .-hall re ert to my nephew Charles K. Washburn. The detectives searched in vain for the boy. It was reported to his mother now here, that he had sailed for Australia. Saturday night he turned up loookint; like a tramp at Chico, on the Central Pacific railway. He saw a newspaper containing an account of the search being made tor him. He had no money and was unable to write, but taking the newspaper he showed it to con ductors along the road. do;ne of them believed and carried him over their di visions. Others threw him off the train, but he finally cot to San Francisco, after siwinsr a pile of fire wood on the Oakland side of the bay to raise money to pay his way over the ferry. He had roamed over the greater part of the Pacific eoust before reaching Chico, on his way to Ne .-iska. He will go east with his mother to claim the fornVne. 

SHOT TO DEATH. Mempius. Tenn., Dec. 3. In the little town of Charleston, Miss., about fifty miles from Memphis, three negroes, Joe Tribble. Monroe Harris and Charles Tay lor, were confined in jail on a charge of attempting to kill a white man named Frank Mountz. One of the negroes had a quarrel with Mountz about three weeks ago, and was thrashed. He got a couple of his friends to make his grievance their?, and the three attempted to kill Mountz. They have been in jail two weeks awaiting theiui ion of the grand jury. This morn ing a mob of forty or more men, well arm ed, rode into town, forct-d the jail, ordered Vance to give up the keys to the cell and took the prisoners out. The bodies of the prisoners and Taylor were found on the ro.nl about a mile from town, riddled with buckshot both dead. Tribble ha- not been heard from, but it is considered certain that he was shot to death. OUTLAW KILLED. ATOLLA. T. T Dec. 5. Deputy United States Marshall StokeJy was. "killed itear !

No Hitches Occurred in the Organ ization of Either. Save for One Objection. This was Eaibetl Against Faulk uer. of AVcst Virginia, by Senator Hear, of Massachusetts. Carlisle Elected Speaker of the House A Strong1 Speech in Favor of a lig Re duction of Tariff. Washington, Dec. The senate cham ber woie a tasteful appearance this morn ing. The floors and galleries were newly carpeted and the' desks glistened in their coat of varnish, the odor of which, min gled with that of the boquets and gorgeous flowers enlivened the picture. The senators began to arrive and take their seats before 11 o'clock, Senators Stewart and Kiscock being the first comers. For an hour before noon, the floor was a busy scene, members of both parties, friends and officers of the senate taking occasion to exchange greetings, and com pare notes. The chief topic of con versation with the majority was the prospect of a conflict over the admission of certain Democratic sena-tois-elect, and it early became known that the Republicans, in default of any caucus plan of action, had concluded to follow the lead of the members of the committee on privileges and elections. There has been an informal consultation, it was under stood, and had reached the conclusion to make no opposition to the admission of Mr. Turpie of Indiana, but to object to the call of Mr. Faulkner of West Virginia, on tliegiound that there were conflicting ore dentials from that state. The general opinion was that there would bo no dead lock and that the usual course of the open ing of congress would not bis biokcn. The galleries w ue early crowded and to overflowing. Mrs. Cleveland, clad in a costume of dark green and accompanied by Mrs. Gilder. Mrs. Kingsford and scl eral other lady friends, occupied seats re served for theVamily ot the president in one of the private galleries. The diplomatic gallery was filled by members ot various legations, th front seat being occupied by the Chinese minister, his secretaries and associates. The minister woie a magnifi cent robe of light blue satin, and his com panions were clad as richly, though in more subdued colors. The proceeding-, of the day were opened with prayer by Chaplain J. E. Butler. He asked that the senators might be endowed with wisdom and strength to meet honora bly tlje trying responsibilities of the day, and all the duties that gather around thom. The president of the senate, Mr. Ingalls, after calling the body to order, submitted the certificates of election of the new mem bers. Among these was the certificate of the governor of West Virginia of the ap pointment by him of Daniel B. Lucas to till the vacancv causeif by the expiration of the term, ot Senator. Gamden. There was also the certificate of the governor of West Virginia of a summary of the pro ceedings bv which the legislature in spe cial session elected Charles J. Faulkner as senator to fill the vacancy. In addition to this there was a protest of Daniel B. Lucas agoinst the administration of the office to Charles .1. Faulkner. Tiie grounds of the protest are: First- That the executive of the state of West Virginia has not certified the elec tion of Charles J. Faulkner under the seal of the state, as required by act of congress. Second For reasons set out in the brief of Daniel B. Lucas, a copy of which ac companied the protest. Third Because Charles J. Faulkner was at the time and date of his election on the rth of Mav, 1SS7, a judge of the Fifteenth judii ial district ot West Virginia, and therefore ineligable to the otfice of scna toi. The protest was laid on the table and ordered to be printed in the record. The ceremony of administering th oath of office to the newly elected .senators was then pioceeded with such sena tors being allied in parties of four and all in order. The first four senators thus called and sworn fin all instances with uplifted hands nut nni on the bible) were Aidnch. Bate, Blodgett and Chandler. The second four weie Cockrell, Daniel, D;n is and Dawes. The third four called were Edmunds.Falk ner, George and Gorman. Mr. Hoar ob jected for the time being to administering the oa.h of office to Mr Faulkner. He un derstood that whatever question arose con cerning the title of that senator to a seat arose on the credentials themselves. The whole proceemngs of the lgi-lature and the hi-tor pf the case being there disclosed and fully "recited. Assuming that in ac cordance with the usages of the senate he would, himself, be a meralwr of the committee on privileges and elections, he gave the assurance that the question should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. o that the gen tlenian entitled to the -eat would be able to enter on the discharge of his duties as senator. Mr. Kenna said that the course Mig gcsrtd seemed eminently approprinte. ami he trusted that that action would e taken without the formality of a vote. Tha. sug gestion was adopted. The oath was administered to the other three senators, and gubbequuntly to Sen ator Gray, Hale. Hawley, Hearst, Keagau, Sawver, Sherman, Stewart, Stoekbridge and Turpie. At the suggestion of Snntor est. the Privileges of tli floor were given to Mr. 'aulkner lending the decision of the contt. Mr Harris presented a memorial for a constitutional amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale, importation, exporta tion or transportation of alrahoiic drinks in the L'nitea State?. Referred. Mr. Hoar presented a memorial of K. X. F Winter and other- in resfiect to the -tii of Senator Turpie. of Indiana, and moved its reference to the committee on priv ileges and el wt ion. So ordered. Resolution were adopted to inform the house that a quorum of the onat had assembled, and for the appointment of a committw; of two to join a like committee of the house, and inform the president thai quorums of both hottste ImmI assem bled and that congress was rwulv u re ceive any communications he might be nlea-ed to make. Messrs. Morrill and Morgan were appointed on such a com mittee on the part of the senate, wbieh then adjourned.

John G. Carlisle was put in nomination by Mr. Cox. of New York, and Thomas B Reed, by Mr. Cannon, of Illinois. The vote resulted as follows: Total number of votes cast 313. For Carlisle, 103; for Reed 14$: for Bnimm, of Pennsyl vania, 2. Of the fonr independents. Ander son, of Town, voted for Carlisle, Nichols, of North Carolina and Smith, of Wisconsin, forBrumm, while Hopkins, of Virginia, did not vote. The clerk thereupon de clared Mr. Carlisle to be duly elected speaker and that gentleman was escorted to the speaker's desk by Messrs. Cox and and Reed amid loud applause. The oath of the otfice having been administered by Mr Kelly, of Pennsylvania, the speaker rapped the house to order and said: Gen tlemen of the house of representatives In assuming for the third time the duties of the responsible office for which you have just chosen me, I desise to tender my grateful thanks for the distinguished favor conferred, and to assure you ft will be my constant endeavor to justify the confidence reposed on me by a fair and impartial administration of the law governing your proceeding-. In his efforts to promote the prompt and regular transaction of the public busines-, the presiding officer of a body like this, is almost entirely dependent upon the co-operation of the gentlemen on the floor, and it is very great encourage ment to one to know from past experience that he can always rely upon your active support when he is right, and on your kind indulgence when he is wrong. I shall, doubtless, have frequent occasion to invoke your indulgence, but I trust you will never have cause to complain that it has been abused. There has rarely ever been a time in our history when the con tinued prosperity of the country depended so largely upon the legislation in congress as now; lor reason that dangers which at this time threaten the commercial and in dustrial interests of the people are the direct results of the laws which congress alone can modify or repeal. Neither the executie department of the general gov ernment nor local authorities of the several states cin deal effectively with the situa tion which now confronts us. Whatever is done must be done here, and if nothing is done, the responsibility must rest here. It must be evident to every one who has taken even a partial survey of public af fairs that the time has now come when a revision of our revenue laws and a reduc tion of taxation are absolutely necessary in order to prevent a large anil daugerous accumulation of money in the treasury Whether this ought or ought not to have been done heretofore is a question which it would be useless now to discuss. It is sullicient for us to know that the financial condition of the government and private business of people alike, demand a prompt consideration of these subjects ami a speedy enactment of some substantial measures of relief. I'nfortunatelj', we are menaced bv dangers from opposite direc tions. While the policy of non-action must inevitably result sooner or later in a serious injury to the coftnrty. we cannot be unmindful of the fact that a hasty and in considerate legi dation of the sul jects, more or less afflicting the large financial and industrial interest, might produce, temporarily, at least, disturban ces and embarrassments which a more prudent course would entirely avoid investments made and labor employed in numerous and valuable industries which I have grown up under our present system Ol Ul.MlWUIl UllgllL UOC lO 1)1' HUitlJ uniuiw- ed'by sudden and radical changes in the policy to which they have adjusted them selves: but just demands of the overtaxed people and obvious requirements of finan cial situation cannot be entirely ignored without seriously imperilling the much greater and more widely extended inter ests than any that could possibly be in juriously affected by moderate and reasonable reduction of duties. No part of our people are more immediately or vitally interested in the continuance of the financial prosperity than thoso who labor for wages. Fpon them and their families must always fall the most disas trous consequences of a monetary crisis. And they, too, arealwajs last to realize the benefit of a return to prospeioustizies. Their wages are always first to fall when the crisisTcomes and last to rise when it passes awa . A committee consisting of Messrs. Cox, Randall, and Cannon wis appointed to wait upon the president and announce to him that the house was organized and ready to receive any communication he should see fit to make. Then the members were reo nested to re tire behind the semi-circle of lesk.s and the lottery for seats was ljegun A blind folded page drew from a box marbles Insur ing numbers corresponding with members placed before the names of members on the official roll call. Del ore the drawing on motion of Mr. Breckenridge,'of Kentucky, Mr. Kelly, of Pennsjlvania. was accorded the privilige of horsin,i "tK seat, in advance.
