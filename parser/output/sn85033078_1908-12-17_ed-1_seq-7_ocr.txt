Xot relishing the prospect of such com pany, the Scotsman said in his smooth est tones. “Alt. this is a smoking car riage, my good woman!” The fishwife took no notice, hut pushed in. “My good woman, this is a smoking car riage.” repeated the male passenger in louder tones. The fishwife put her creel in the corner and sat down op posite to him. and the train started. Then the woman put her hand in a pocket of her blue iietticoat, took out a large black pipe, lit it. and. blowing a cloud of rank smoke that nearly suf focated her companion, remarked, “And so. my mannie, ye thocht naebody could fak’ a draw but yerself.” Every German soldier’s equipment in cludes a Bible aud a half-pound cake of chocolate.

Exhaustive tests have proved the new torpedo nets of the navy able to withstand the attacks of torpedoes fired at the highest speed yet reached. The pleasantest month of the year at Chamounix and other places in Swit zerland was October. But the tourists had all departed and the hotels were dosed. Some hospital physicians are urging that horseflesh be more freely used as being not only cheaper than beef, but more tender and digestible. If dried and reduced to a powder it becomes almost tasteless. The Hon. W. S. Fielding. Canadian minister of finance, raises and spends 5100,000,000 a year on a $7,000 sal ary. Mr. B’ielding is the only promi nent member left of the old cabinet that gathered about Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1896, having held his position twelve years. Rodin’s bust of Whistler Is almost ready. The sculptor Is to have $2,500 for his 'work. The bust has given the utmost satisfaction In Paris; so much so that a replica Is to be subscribed for Xew York. Whistler was an American, but he once, on oath, in a court of jus tice, declared that he was born In St Petersburg. Lead, when reduced to a very low temperature in liquid air, is said to act much as steel at ordinary temperatures. It will serve as a helical spring, for example. Just as iron Is soft and in elastic at a high red color, so lead Is dull and soft at ordinary temperatures, for It is then already well on its way to be melted. A curious disease which has done much damage to the tea crops of north est India is known as “red rust.” An account of the species of alga (Cepa leuros virescens), which causes It, is given by C. M. Hutchinson In the Me moirs of the Agricultural Department of India. It attacks the leaves and stems of the tea plant, forming yellow patches. It Is propagated by two kinds of spores, one carried by water and the other by air. Francis Galton, who is now 86 years old, studied surgery in the old daj's before chloroform was used, and says of the Birmingham hospital: “The cries of the poor fellows who were operated on were very characteristic; in fact, each class of operation seemed to evoke some peculiar form of them. All this was terrible, but only at first. It seem ed after a while as though the cries were somehow disconnected with the operation, upon which the whole atten tion became fixed.” At a luncheon given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester Dean Welldon sat next to Beerbohm Tree. “Well, Mr. Tree, what have you been doing to day?” he asked. “I went for a long motor ride this morning and lost a bet,” replied the famous actor. “In deed,” said the dean, “and may I ask what the bet was?” “I made a bet that we would pass through 400 different odors and we only encountered 399.” “Ah,” replied Dr. Welldon promptly, “you missed the odor of sanctity.”— Mainly About People. An Interesting experiment has been made by a Mr. Simpson of Port Eliza beth, Cape Colony, in order to prove that there is room for anew Industry in South Africa. Mr. Simpson has be come Impressed with the fact that pa per might he cheaply manufactured from the aloe, and to support his the ory he has made a large sheet of paper. He had no machinery, and therefore the paper is somewhat loose grained. But it is strong and of sufficiently good quality to suggest that Mr. Simpson is right iu his contention. The number of cremations in Great Britain In 1906 was 732, an increase of 138 as compared with the previous year. In 1907 there were 705. The number of crematories Is thirteen, of which six are municipal. Cremation In Great Britain is almost wholly confined to persons of some Intellectual distinc tion. The average citizen is still held in the fetters of custom. Many persons live in fear of being buried alive, and make provision in their wills that a doctor shall divide a main artery or thrust a kulfe through the heart. Women in the province of Shima, on the southern coast of Japan, are the sterner sex. They do most of the field work and are also employed as divers. They enter the water at all seasons ex cept during the coldest months of the winter. They remain under water some times for more than a minute, and bring up shellfish and tengusa, a kind of seaweed, which they place In a small net carried by each diver at the girdle. These women divers are extremely hardy, but as theirs Is a trying life the constant exposure causes them to age quickly. Dr. C. W. Andrews of the geological department of the British Museum has started on a scientific expedition to Christmas Island, in the Indian ocean. Ten years ago the Island was unin habited. Since then It has been opened up, owing to Its guano deposits, and there are now a number of persons there. The object of the present visit is to ascertain what effect the agency of man has had on a native fauna and flora. It is believed, for Instance, that the native rat, which was found on the island, has now been exterminated by the Introduction of the common brown rat of England. A spirited controversy In Xew Zea land centers around an old stone an chor which has been deposited in the Wellington Museum. It Is alleged on the one hand that It belonged to Kupe, the famous Maori Columbus of the South Seas, who discovered Xew Zea land. On the other hand. It Is con tended that it could not have been Kupe’s, because It was found at Pare mata, whereas Kupe landed at Palllser bay, and must have left it on the shore there when he turned his canoes up side down at Martlnborough. There are three mounds there which are sup posed to have covered the canoes with drifting earth and sand. Among the Maoris ihe place is still called Xga- Waka-a-Kupe, the Canoes of Kupe.

RULE EXPRESS. Census Inquiry Shows Railway* Are Large Holders of Carrier Stocks. FIX RATES BY AGREEMENTS. Six Leading Companies Dominate in the Package Transportation Business. An investigation of the express busi ness of the I’nited States has just been completed by the census bureau of the government, which covers all j (bases of ihat business and shows in detail the relations of the express companies with the railroads of the country. It is shown, for instance, that the railroads of the country own more than one fourth of the stock of the express com panies and that, in turn, the express companies own railroad stock to the amount of more than 522.000.000. which is also a figure in excess of one-fourth of their own capitalization. The con tracts between the companies and the railroads are set forth as well as the method of determining the rates. In 1007 there were thirty-four ex press companies as compared with eigh teen in 1800. Only ten of the companies reporting in 1800 were in existence un der the same name in 1007: the remain ing eight companies have gone out of business, have been absorbed by other companies or are operating under other names. The total express mileage has increased from 174,059 miles to 23-7.003 miles, a gain of 37.7 per cent. Companies that Dominate. In 1907 as in 1800 the express busi ness was dominated by the following companies: Adams. American, Pacific, Southern, United States, and Wells, Fargo & Cos. The last-mentioned leads In the amount of mileage operated, with the American Express Company a close second. These six leading companies operated 02.7 per cent of the total mile age in 1890 and 87.7 per cent in 1007. In the number of miles covered by express companies Texas ranks first among the States and territories, fol lowed. in the order named, by Illinois, lowa. Ohio. Pennsylvania, Xew York and Kansas. The use of steamboat lines is most extensive in Alaska, where water routes furnish practically the only facilities for transportation. In Maine. Xew York, Washington and Michigan the steamboat mileage is also large. Electric roads are used by the express companies in only twenty States. Seventy-two per cent of the total mileage by electric roads is in Ohio. Xew York and California. In only fifteen States are stage lines still used by express companies, and 88.7 per cent of the mileage of such lines Is in the \\ estern States, principally California and Nevada. Receipts anil Esiirmlilnre*. The total receipts of all the express companies amount to .$128,117,176, of which 07 per cent is receipts from op eration and 3 j>er cent receipts from other sources. Over 00 per cent of the total receipts represents the receipts of the six leading companies. Two im portant items of exjiense in the express business arc the amounts paid to steam roads and the salaries and wages, which in 1!H)7 were $76,378,349 and $30,531,774, respectively, and together constituted, as in 1890, over SO per cent of the reported operating expenses. BIG APPLE CROP. This Year's Growing Estimated to Be About 25,000,000 Barrels If the apple harvest in the commer cial orchards of the United States this year were converted into pies the army of bakers needed to do the work would turn out 6,270.000,000 of them, and these placed side by side would make a path of almost 077,000 miles. The total weight of this mountain of pastry is estimated at 9,210.000 pounds. Including 6.127,000,000 pounds of flour, lard and other ingredients used in the popular American after-dinner dessert, and would require 174.166 cars, of standard capacity to transport them from the ovens to the consumers. Twenty-five million barrels, or 62.- 500.000 bushels, is the estimated yield this season, according to reports receiv ed by Harry J. Xeely. secretary of the national apple show at Spokane, from 15.000 growers, operating the various belts in the Union. The returns show that while droughts, excessive rains, or pests wrought havoc in many districts in the middle western, eastern aud several southern States, the entire crop is fully as large as in 1907 and it is better dis tributed. Prices also are higher than last year. However, the domestic sup ply is smaller than at any time since 1897, for the reason that the demand of the export trade is heavier and in creasing yearly. Rad KiuotioiiN Polnoiioon. Dr. Landone, who plans to improve the human race by Burbank's plant theories in the rearing of children, in a recent interview dwelt on the value of cultiva ting love and cheerfulness and good thoughts toward mankind. “For,” he said, “the body is a substance composed of chemicals and these chemicals are at the mercy of the emotions. Anger, hatred and sorrow poison the fluids of the body, while love, cheerfulness and happiness serve as eliminators of emotive and fa tigue poisons. The Tuberculosis Exhibit. The international tuberculosis exhibi tion which was first brought together at great expense during the recent congress of experts at Washington, has now been moved to the Museum of Xatural His tory at Xew York f *r the benefit of the people of that city. Nobel Prize to MetehnlkolT. Prof. Metohnikoff. the Russian subdi rector of the Pasteur Institute, who will receive half the Xobe! prize this year for medico-physiological research, announces that he will devote the sum to further study of means to promote longevity. Work of Organized Charity. The Charity Organization Society, which operates in many different cities from headquarters in Xew York, reports that in the past year it carried 5,771 families at Xew York, compared to 3.336 families the year before. It is able to say that it has not refused help to any fam ily in need with notice. The report says that the nationalization of social reform movements is going on rapidly, and that the organized Pittsburg survey, including tie typhoid fever investigation, the study of San Francisco relief work, of working men’s insurance and of the placing out of children, are some of the evidences of this new spirit.

FIRE LOSSES ARE ENORMOUS. Figures Show Big Increase Over Those of Last Year. The fire loss of the United States and Canada for the month of October as com piled from the carefully kept records of tlie Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin, aggregates $22,722,880. The fol lowing table giving the losses by months for this year and the preceding tear af fords a startling comparison, demonstrat ing the unusually heavy fire waste of the past few months: mot. 1008. January $ 24.0454.000 $ 20.582.000 February 10.876.000 18.485.7041 March 20.550,700 145,728,84)0 April 21.025.000 245.000.000 May 145.280.300 15.181.150 June 14.705.4100 10.512.000 July 18.2441.150 15.828.750 August 20,248,000 23,123,000 September 11.440.400 21,431,400 October 13,350.250 22.728.850 Total $180,757,200 $208,758,750 It will be seen that, like September, the month just closed exhibited an enor mous increase of loss over the same month in 1907. and that 1908 so far shows $28,- 000,000 more loss than for the first ten months of 1097. The month of October furnished no less than 894 fires resulting in a loss of $lO,- 000 or over in each instance. These fires, classified according to their destructive ness, give the following showing; $ 10.000 to $20.000 147 20.000 to SBO,OOO 65 30.000 to $50.000. 63 50.000 to $75.000 53 75.000 to SIOO,OOO 20 100.000 to $200,000 28 200.000 and over 18 Total 394 There were during October this year eighteen fires causing an aggregate loss each of $260,000 or over. C C HOOI.S (OLLEtES Prof. Kenneley of Harvard says that the importance attached to winning a race and beating a concrete competitor is old-fashioned and savors of the “ante chronometer” days, and that the imper sonal scientific age demands a different attitude in athletics. He says that the only attempt worth while nowadays is to have a try against the record. The Cornell educational special is the first farm train to be sent out by the New York State College of Agriculture. Forty-five minute stops were made at the smaller stations, and the subjects chosen for the lectures were those adapt ed to the products raised in the territory covered. In the larger towns and cities the boards of trade hired halls for the speakers, and many people attended the lectures. Schools were given a holiday to enable students to attend. In discussing the subject of refractory children at the Congress of Neurologists in session recently at (Jlient. Belgium, it was generally admitted by physicians pres ent that the refractory can not be cured by repressive measures. “It is quite possible.” said one. “to punish a child into jail.” It was agreed that cast un manageable children suffer from some nervous disease and should he treated as sick rather than as merely refractory. Great stress was laid on the necessity of developing the psychic faculties. The Harvard library has just received the largest single gift of books. It was presented by Edward D. Brandegee of Brookline, on behalf of his wife, and is to be known as the Weld Memorial in memory of Mrs. Brandegee's grandmother. William Fletcher Weld, a benefactor of the college. The gift consists of 11,887 volumes, hundreds of which are not now in the library. Many are specimens of •printing and engraving that appeared be fore or soon after 1500 and were the earliest works of the book-printing art.

A State branch of the National So ciety for Promoting Industrial Education was formed at New York City, with prominent men as officers and directors. It will work to bring together all the forces interested in industrial education for the purpose of making most effective a law recently passed by the Legislature making it permissive to establish trade schools Throughout the State. In an address before the students of Northwestern university. E. C. Mercer, a reformed drunkard now engaged in evan gelistic work in Chicago, gave higher edu cation as a cause for filling prisons. M'hile working in New York he said that fully one-third of the ragged and dirty men that he met were college-bred men. Four hundred college men stood in the bread line, he asserted. Mercer also made the statement that 75 per cent of the prisoners at Sing Sing were college grad uates. He attributed the downward course these men take to “wine, women and song.” indulged in during college day. The Toledo (Ohio) Board of Educa tion has decided to furnish free break fasts to all of its school children who may be deprived of nourishment at home, as soon as the service can be extended to all of the school buildings. The plan was tried in one building last year with good results. The meal consisted of hot cereal or milk toast, breakfast meat and a glass of milk. Snpt. Cooley of the Chicago schools has submitted a plan for the establishment ol technical high schools for girls in each section of the city, in which the students will be taught cooking, sewing and othei strictly “womanly” occupations "without the interference of boys.” 1 I 

WORK OF I j COMPRESS j Vice President Fairbanks called the Senate to nriler Monday and Rev. Ed ward Everett Hale opened the session with prayer. Senators Aldrich. Gallln ger and Teller were appointed in pur suance of a resolution offered by Sen ator Hale, to wait niton the President and inform him that Congress was ready to receive his annual message. Senator Dillingham presented the cre dentials of his colleague. Senator-elect Carroll S. Page, of Vermont, and the oath of office was administered to him by the Vice President. Senator Dolliver announced the death of the late Sen ator Allison of lowa, and resolutions expressing the profound sorrow of the Senate over this bereavement were adopted. Asa further mark of res peer to his memory the Senate, after a ses sion lasting but fifteen minutes, ad journed for the day. After being in session an hour, one-half of which time was consumed by a roll call, tne House of Representatives. wbi<-h met at noon for the second session of the Sixtieth Congress, adjtiurned out of respect to the memory of several of its own num bers and of Senator Allison, all of whom died during the recess. After listening to the reading of the President’s message the miscellaneous work of the Senate Tuesday consist 'd in the main of the reference in execu tive session of about 1.54X1 recess nomi nations. which were sent in by the President, and the adoption of resolu tions of regret on account of the death of members of the House who have passed away since the adjournment last May. The residing of the President's annual message was the chief business of the session, but a number of bills were sent to conference, among them being one providing for anew immigra tion station in Boston. In addition, the speaker announced the appointment of Mr. Higgins, of Connecticut, to a place on the committee on judiciary in place of Mr. Littlefield, and of Mr. Martin to a place on the committee on Indian affairs in place of Mr. Parker, de ceased. The Senate session Wednesday was devoted chiefly to the formal presenta tion of departmental reports and the introduction of bills. The reports have been made public from time to time and the bills, numbering 352, were chiefly for the granting of pensions. Senator Johnston, of Alabama, intro duced a bill to reinstate former Cadets Rossell and Weaver, dismissed from the military academy for hazing. He declared that their punishment was excessive and said that every new Sen ator was hazed by being given unim portant assignments and being restrict ed in his privileges. For nearly five house the House considered the bill providing for the taking of the thir teenth and subsequent decennial cen suses. and passed it without material change. Prolonged, animated and. at times, heated discussion was precipi tated over an amendment by Mr. Gil lett, of Massachusetts, who sought to have the temporary census force au thorized by the bill with the excep tion of a few minor positions, appoint ed upon the basis of competitive instead of non-competitive examinations. The Senate held a short session Thursday, during which an agreement was reached for taking up the omnibus claims Dill Monday with the under standing that it shall not interfere with the consideration of tin* postal savings bill or any other measure in which senators are especially interested. Aft er a short executive session the Senate adjourned until Monday in respect to the memory of the late Representative Charles T. Dunwell. of New York. At no time was there a quorum in the House. The legislative appropriation bill was presented and several bflls passed, among them being one author izing the removal of the inqiogition of loss of citizenship upon deserters in the military and naval services. The rest of the day was taken up in discussing the bill to provide for the arbitrary in vestigation of difficulties between em ployers and employes. The Senate was not in session Fri day. In the House the legislative, ex ecutive and judicial appropriation bill, which usually excites considerable dis cussion. lasting for several days, was ■passed with little debate and practi cally in the shape in which it came from committee. An unusual feature was that no member asked for time to indulge in general talk. The Dill car ries an appropriation of $81.665.820. The House, immediately after conven ing. unanimously and without debate adopted a resolution providing for the appointment of a committee of five to consider the reference to the secret service in the President’s message, and to suggest what action, if any. should be taken in the matter.
