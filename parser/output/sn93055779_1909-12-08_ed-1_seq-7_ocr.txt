New York, Dec. 1, The stock ex change business today dwindled to snjall proportions. The constant fluc tuations in prices indicated that oper ators are of an uncertain frame of mind. Variableness mirrored the vagaries of the speculative temper rather than any developments of af fairs. The president's message was called conservative, but Taft's post ponement for treatment in special messages subjects of changes in the anti-trust and inter-state commerce laws left little for immediate ap praisement in the stock market. The rise in American Suar was ascribed to the stand against a congressional investigation, and at least immunity is thus to be given some of those prosecuted. Pacific Mail rose on the ship-sub sidy paragraph. The fact that prices fell sharply last week in apprehension of the president's unfriendly treat ment of corporations and rebounded I violently Saturday, after the tenor of the message became known, measures the financial opinion of the case more reliably than did today's market. j The denials of reports that a gen eral strike of the railroad employes is contemplated ' helped railroad stocks some. The upturn In United States steel influenced the whole list. jThe government's estimate estimate of a very large area planted in win - iter wheat and the high per cent of the condition of that crop proved a . late stimulating influence. The last I iwui oi me eessiuii was ine uusiesi, the" day's gains mostly being made in .that time. ' NEW
