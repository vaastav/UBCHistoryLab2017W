Mr Harbison's message only corrobo? rates the troth of what has been paid of htm ever since be entered the White House? thu he is not a national, bat a sectional and p viisan President. The voters of the Norl h not Ssnth aiike, and republicans as well as de jccrat^, by a majority of over six huo drei thousand, have recently declared aga'nsl the urjust, unequal, injurious and eec .ionai rceisurea proposed by him and hie alvisors, but he insists that eaob. and a 1 o* thos? measures shall be forced through Con gr.ss by the prrs>nt small but arbitrary re? publican majority ia that body. According tobirn, no change must b-j made in the tariff, no low rate interest bouda ba issued, and no "let up" take p'sc? in pois on bills, but fuo Bldies to ship owners mu;t be granted, and th.9 Fore* an.1 ^apportionment bills must bs paBSed?the latter upon a census knowD of all men to be fa'so. Knowing that ho ao possible cbance of rsnomination, Mr, H-.rrisoals evidently trying to make the repuVicin p*rty so uopopu:ar that nobody it may nominate ran bn elpo'ed. That the President not cn'y did not write hie message, but did not even tak? the I rouble to read the different parts of it writ Ii n by other people, and put them in accord, i' p'a:n to be seen by the fact that in the paragraph ca siiver he eayp; ' The incre*s-? of monfty in cironlation during the nineteen months baa been ia the aggregate $93.866, S13. or l1)'u; J1.50 per capita, and of thisic or?.'.:::- culy $7,lO"\000 w&e due to the rec;u( s. ver legislation;" while in that on the tai if bo says : "The tnlargt mont of our cur? rency by the silver bill undoubtedly give ao u ?ward lern e icy to trade and had u mark? ed ?lL-ct on ptiees ; but this natural and dc eir.-d effect of tho silver legislation vrai by m*py erroneously attributed to the tariff ac .'' Such contrary statem?ats in the same p*p r make the whole m??3*ge ridiculou-1, but they only efford another glaring iuetance of the slipshod wsy in which matters e:e coiducted by the republican administration. General Gkant odco said whenever the i ubiicana were defeated the democrats always came to th&ir relief, or words to that ? flecS, aod s&veral instances go to prove thai h was right. Far the sake of the country, find all parts of it, it Is hoped that it may m: be po now. But it must be confessed n?.? present indications point that way, for the ?oria! assaults mad-s by some detii.-.c a s upon tho democratic organization tfX' w Y :rk city upon which the vote of the State of N w York depends, end upon 1(8 favorKe tor the next P.csldency, are by no means ?nlculateJ to make Tammany enthusiastic i i the scrport of the man whose cdmirere p.re making these asEauits, if he bo the nomine?. PaisiDENT Hakeisjn Insists that a nn j Tity shall rule ia the South as in the Norib, igoorinp; the fact that no matter bow the m j>rity shail be composed in the North, ths rulers would be intelligent white men, while in many counties and districts in the South, and even in several of the southern BtaSes, the mnjirity bring composed of ne g'ces, tho rulers woo'd necessarily be ignor? ant and vicious members of that raoe. But Mr. Harri?oa is too narrow-minded, b'goted and prejudiced to seo any but his own side of eny question. When President Harrison was inaugu? rated be said be would appoint no man P03tmfts!or in the South who was not a rep? resentative of the more reputable people of the vicinage. Ke says in his message that postefficaa in the S.ub in charge of post Eiisters o'j actionable to the people eervetl with nr.il thereat thai! be olosed. Mr. Zia: risoo. egraos with b's friend, Commissioner Eiutn of the pension bureau, now under rthargt-3 of bribery and corruption, that a modern poliiic-ian can't afford to be ccns; -? ent. _ Thr republican S.nators haviDg, by a unaoitn-us vote in caucus, determined to taks up at once and pu^b the immediate passage cf the Fotc-o bill, even if to do so It he nec2?sary tr> revolutionize the rules of the boly of which th.-y are members, their democaic csllengnea will be pot to their tru-nps in order to defeat the dangerous and injurious bii! referred to, and lively tlmst, may soon bs ezpecied on the ? jor of the Senate. Themrmhkks ot th? Farmers' Allia:ce ru^ht to kuow th?-ir own business best, but other people ?i.d i bard tounders'and why oome of the more promit eat men in the con lion of that orgaoiz?ion now tilting in Flcrid'i, were the open and avowe.l sup? porters of Mr. Calboun, the railroad lawyer and wrecker, for U. 6. Senator from Georgia, against the gallant soldier and farmers' trut? f.iecd, Gen, Gordon. In 1SSD President Harrison made a speech, in which he said : "I have taken pieasure in knowing that the prospects of this harvest I wil! aid us in preserving the country egainst J the democratic party as the greatest enemy th? country has." This is bad for the coun? try, aa, according to the returns of the re? cent election, it is in the bands of ita enemies by more than six hundred thousand ma? jority. _ President ?ar?ison, wnen he publicly ?'thacked God be wes not born in the Sooth," evidently Lad in mind the con? dition the South would be in under the operation cf tbe Force bil', wbicb, be tnris?a, most b3 passed during tbia arsdon of Con :". 98, fo that it can. nof ba repealed until :be dToocrais get pcs;65s!t>n of both branch? es of that b dy.

C-. r tain S.Tja-nra who have b?en in the cast eet down as opponents of the elections bill, or who, at ha-'f, were supposed to be lukewarm in its suppor% objected, not to Ibe general principle ef the bill itself, bot to 'be adop? tion of a policy that, in their judgmen*, wou'd probably result in blocking all other important legislation during the remainder of this Congress without guarantee of a suc? cessful termination of the attempt to pasa the elections bill. Several western Senators, j j however, icsisUd that, wiih a proper spirit I of determ'nfition on the part of the mejori I ty, the bill ecu d be rasssd.
