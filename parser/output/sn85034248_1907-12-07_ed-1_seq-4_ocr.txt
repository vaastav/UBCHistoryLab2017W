[New Orleans Times-Democrat.] The message opens with a reassur lng expression as to the sound fun damental business condition of the country and a warning is issued against the boarding of money. The president states that the business of our people is, as a rule, conducted with hone-y and probity, although there are some dishonest persons and some dishonest practices. He reiter ates his opinions regarding the neces sity for the punishment of men in high places who may have been guilty of: dishonesty. He quotes from his mes sage to congress of Dec. 5, 1905, re garding the punishment of the guilty, and the regulation of big corpora tions. Interstate commerce is dealt with, the president emphasizing remarks on the same subject made on former oc casions. The founders of the con stitution provided, he said, that the na tional government. should have the fullest control of interstate commerce. He says that interstate railroad com merce can be but partially regulated by the various states and thus it be comes the duty of the federal govern ment to assume charge. Only the na tional government, he says, can in thorough fashion exercise the needed control. An extension of federal ac tivity is advocated, as the president says the federal government has the necessary power. He disclaims, how ever, that this is an advocacy for cen tralization. He suggests that there should either be a national incorpo ration act or a law licensing railroads jto engage in interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The message con tends that until the federal gevernment assumes full charge of the railway situation, full justice can be neither exacted from nor dealt to the railways. The courts will determine the limits within which the federal authority can exercise it, and there will still remain ample work within each state for the railway commission of the state, says the message, with the national inter state commerce commission working in 

CORPORATION CONTROL. SDealing with the control of corpo rations, the message says that modern industrial conditions are Ruch that combination is not only necessary, but inevitable. The president adv, cates additional legislation dealing with the question of control. He quotes a former message to congress along these lines. The anti-trust law, he says, should not prohibit combi nations that do no injustice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole beneficial to the public. He also complains of the de lays incident to the operation of the present law, which works so that even when the government may gain a victory it is likely to be a barren one. It is recommended that a general law b3 enacted under the provisions of which existing, corporations could take out federal charters and new federal corporations could be created. An essential provision of such ameas ure should be a method of predeter mining by some federal board or com mission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combination within the restrictions of the federal law. The supervision thus suggested would be analagous to that exercised over national banks. The president thinks that such legislation would benefit the big combines as it has benefitted national banks. The message says that those who fear, from any reason, the extension of federal activity will do well to study the history, not only of the national banking act, but of the pure food law, and notably the meat inspection law recently enacted. The co-operation between the state and federal authori ties in connection with the enforcement of the pure food law is called atten tion to. 

CURRENCY QUESTION. Taking up the currency question the president quotes from his message to congress a year ago, in which he pointed out that the present system of currency is seriously defective. In his message at that time he recommended for consideration the plan that na tional banks be permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legiti mate trade. Coming down to present conditions the message urgeaghe need of greater elasticity of the currency, provided that the even greater need of a safe and secure currency is recog nized. The most rigid examination by the national authorities is advocated and provision should also be made for an emergency currency based on adequate securities approved by the government and issued under a heavy tax. It is also recommended that trust com panies be subject to the same super vision as banks. No legislation, how ever, can guarantee the business com munity against the result of specula tive folly, says the message, and no individual can be guaranteed against the results of his own folly. The income account of the nation is reported in a satisfactory condition. Dealing briefly with the tariff, the president is opposed to any action the year before a presidential election. He says that the country is definitely committed to a protective tariff and any effort t) uproot it would cause widespread industrial disaster. On account of the rapid growth of the in dustries of the country it is pointed out that every dozen years or so the tariff should be carefully gone over go a to aOartfltai that no ,iroeio6 or improper benefits are conferred .thereby. When the tax laws are revised it is recommended that the question of an income tax and an Inheritance tax be given careful attention. Both of these taxes, the president thinks, should be part of the system of federal taxa tion. He refers to the systems in other countries, especially Germany and Great Britain. A few years ago, the message says, there was loud complaint that the law could not be invoked against wealthy offenders, but now, it is asserted, there is no such complaint. It is stated that the course of the depart ment of justice during the past few years has been such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law, and that no corporation is too wealthy to be held to account. The laws need strengthening, and should be made more definite. 

LABOR QUESTION. Instances of injustice in the matter of the granting of injunctions in labor disputes are dealt with. Much of the attack on the process of injunction is said to be unwarranted. The matter is commended to the attention of con gress so that some way may be de vised which will limit the abuse of in junctions and protect the rights which from time to time this power of in junction invades. Attention is called to the loss of life and limb on the railroads of the country, and it is suggested that the federal govern.nout take some steps providing for,'au inspection of this feature of the railroads. It is recommended that the national government should be a model em ployer, and to this end congress should adopt legislation providing limited but definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the federal power. It is also recommended that the law be made such that the payment for accident by the employer should be automatic in stead of being a matter for lawsuits. The message advocates that the prin ciples of the eight hour law be as rapidly and as far as possible ex tended to the entire work carried on by the government. It is recommended that congress take up the matter of creating the machinery for compulsory investiga . tion of such industrial controversies as are of sufilclent magnitude and of sufficient concern to the people of the country as 's whole to warrant the - federal government in taking action. The telegraphers' strike of the past summer is cited as an instance where such action on the part of the govern ment would have proven of benefi to all concerned. The capital and labor problem most be solved partly by those directly con B cerned and partly by the enactment and enforcement of good laws, says Sthe message. "It is idle to hold that without good laws, evils such as child 3 labor, as the overworking of women, as the failure to protect employees ' from loss of life and limb, can be ef f fectively reached, any more than the evils of rebates and stock watering can be reached without good laws." It is recommended that the appropria - tion made for the investigation of the overworking of women and child la bor in the District of Columbia and the territories be renewed. The work of the departments of ag riculture and of commerce and labor are commended, and the importance t of the farmer and the mechanic In the life of the nation touched on. A na tional system of inspection and grad ing of grain in suggested. GREAT RIVER HIGHWAYS. Much space is devoted to the conser vation of our natural resources and their proper use. Our great river highways, says the message, should be developed as national highways, the Mississippi, with its tributaries, coming first in importance. From the great lakes to the mouth of the Miss issippi there should be a deep water way with deep waterways leading from it to the east and the west. As an in cident to creating this deep waterway, it is suggested that the government build along its entire lower length levees, which, taken together with the control of the head waters, will at once and forever put a stop to all threat of flood in the immensely fertile Delta country. The territory lying adjacent to the Mississippi along its lower course will thereby become one of the most prosperous and populous, as it is already one of the most fertile farming regions in all the world. A further extension of the irrigation system, in connection with the reclama. tion of swamp lands and the preserva tion of the forestry, is advocated. The question of public lands is takes up and several recommendations of the public land commissioner dealt with. Considerable space is Riven to the preservation of the forests and the importance of the work. The message says: "There should be no tariff on any forest product grown In this country; and, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice of the change being given to those en gaged in the business, so as to enable them to readjust themselves to the new conditions. The repeal of the duty on wood pulp should, if possible, be accompanied by an agreement with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian pulp wood." The question of the government mineral lands is also discussed. A report on the work on the Panama Canal goes into detail as to what is being accomplished. Regarding postal affairs, it is ree ommended that a postal savings baan b established and that the postal par, eels system be extended in accoardnoe with recommendations of the pest master general. itegardtal preeild4ettal oampalgcl the message says it is well to provide for the publication of campaign contri butions and to provide thatc orpora lions shall not be allowed to contrib ute to such funds. It is also recom mended that a national gallery of art be established in Washington. The work of the biological survey is fa vorably commented on, and attention is called to the unsatisfactory work. inlogs of the ocean mail service. Discussing the needs of the army, it is recommended that the'medical corps be made larger, also that the pay of offcers and enlisted men be increased. Other recommendations looking to making the army more attractive to enlisted men are made. In regard to the needs of the navy, it is recommended that four new bat tleships should be provided for this year, together with plenty of torpedo boats and destroyers, and both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts fortifica tions of the best type should be pro vided. The importance of properly defending harbors so that the navy can be footloose in case of war is dealt on with emphasis. It is recom mended that the fleet be shifted from one seacoast to the other every year or two. Minor matters oonnected with the Naval Academy and the pro motion of officers are treated of. Taking up the question of foreign affairs, the message deals with The Hague conference and what was ac complished by it. Brief attention is given to our relations with Cuba and the question of our tariff relations with that country are gone into. The relations with other countries and Secretary Root's visit to Mexico are lightly touched on in concluding the report. Addreu to Csttee Owsers. Paul M. Potts, president of the Louisiana division of the Southern Cotton Association, has issued the following address to the cotton own ers of the state: "About three weeks ago when things looked their worst in cotton market affairs I issued a circular letter ask ing the people to stand together and make the fight to a finish for fifteen cent cotton. Today I want to renew that request, and now call on every man who owns a bale of cotton to hold on to it tighter than he ever has held and his reward will surely be_ fit teen cents for his cotton. "The more persistently that cotton is held the sooner will the price reach fifteen cents and the sooner will the cotton producers realize that they have won the greatest victory in the history of the world. "Common sense will convince any man that cotton will bring just what the owners of cotton will make it bring. You cannot get $100 for a horse if you will sell it for $75, and you can not get 15 cents for your cotton if you will sell it for 11, 12, 13 or 14 cents. "Pay no attention to the bearish ar guments that will appear from time to time in the newspapers who are un friendly to 15-cent cotton. Sit steady in the boat and victory will surely be yours."
