SENATE ACTION. Resolutions on the Monroe Doctrine and for the Recognition of Cuba Introduced In the Senate. Washington; Dec 4. Resolutions on the Monroe doctrine and Cuba were introduced in the senate yesterday by Senators Lodre, Cullom, Allen and CalL Senator Lodge's resolution is as follows: That the congress of the United States deems it proper to assert, as a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States are involved, that the American conti nents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European-powers. That we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any por tion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or dep ndencies of any European power we have not interfered, and shall not interfere, but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consid eration and on just principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any Euro pean power, in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. That in accordance with the doctrine laid down by President Monroe, as stated in the preceding resolutions, the United States de clares that it proposes to maintain the princi ples embodied in that doctrine, and will re gard any infringement of it or any attempt on the part of any European power to take or acquire new territory on the American conti nent, whether under the pretense of boundary disputes or otherwise, as an act of hostility to the United States. That the president be requested to com municate these resolutions to the governments of all nations with whom we have relations of amity and commerce. Senator Cullom also introduced a resolution on the same subject. It is as follows: That the policy proclaimed by President Monroe and since known as the Monroe doc trine is, Dy precedent and tradition, the recog nized, rightful policy of the United States, and that this government will regard the estab lishment by any European power of any new colonial dependency or of any protectorate over any existing or future .government, or the control or ownership of any interoceanic canal on the continent of America, as a dangerous menace to the welfare and prosperity of the United States. Senators Call and Allen introduced resolutions for the recognition as bel ligerents of the Cuban insurgents. That of Senator Allen declares in favor of the purchase or annexation of all islands in close proximity to the main land. His resolution follows: Resolved. That it is the sense of the Senate that the government of the United States of America should promptly recognize the revo lutionists of Cuba, who are now honestly struggling to secure their independence of the Spanish government, as composing an inde pendent nation, possessing all the rights there of, according to the laws of nations. That all islands in close proximinty to the United States of America should as speedily as possible, by treaties of purchase, be annexed to this government as essent ial to our safety ir times of war and the convenience and neces sity of our commerce in times of peace. That the wise declaration of President Mon roe known as the Monroe doctrine is a well establishei policy of the government of the United States and should be promptly and ef fectually maintained by the government in its original purity and purpose. That, while the government of the United States should not needlessly or hastily embroil itself with any foreign power and should only resort to extreme measures in cases of abso lute necessity, a firmer and more prompt pol icy on the part of this government in main taining the rights of American citizens abroad should be introduced and pursued. Senator Call's resolution reads: Resolved, That the government of the United States recognize a condition of public war be tween the government of Spain and the gov ernment proclaimed and for some time main tained by force of arms by the people of Cuba, and the United States of America hereby de clare that they will maintain a condition of strict neutrality between the contending pow ers and accede to each all the rights of bellig erents in the ports and territory of the United States. The congress of the United States protests and remonstrates against the barbarous man ner in which the war in Cuba has been con ducted, and the president is hereby authorized to take such steps as may be expedient in his judgment to secure ar: observance of the laws of war by civilized nations.

SUCCEED JACKSON. Kufus W. I'eckham Named for Associate Justice of tlie Supreme Court. Washington, Dec. 4. The president has nominated Rufus W. Peckham, of New York, to be associated justice of the United States supreme court to succeed the late Howell E. Jackson, of Tennessee. It is believed his nom ination will be satisfactory to Senator Hill, whose opposition was successful in preventing the confirmation of Messrs. Hornblower and Wheeler Peck ham, two New Yorkers, whose names were sent in by President Cleveland for the supreme court judgeship, now held by Justice White, of Louisiana. Sen ator Hill, on several occasions, has spoken very highly of the nominee. The nomination will go first to the senate judiciary committee, which al ways scrutinizes closely the record of persons named for the supreme court bench, but in view of the high reputa tion of Judge Peckham, it is believed confirmation will follow as speedily as consistent with the importance of the office.

WALLER'S BEHALF. The Kansas Delegation Will Look Earnest ly After the ex-Consul Case. Washington, Dec. 4. The Kansas delegation in congress is determined to leave nothing undone to secure the release of ex-Consul John L. Waller from his imprisonment in France. After the president's message had been read yesterday the entire delega tion of senators and members, includ ing republicans and populists, held a meeting to decide upon their course of action. It was resolved to push a reso lution in both houses calling upon the president for all the papers and corre spondence in the case. Several mem bers thought this resolution should be accompanied by one stating it to be the view of congress that the president should take immediate action.

Report of the Comptroller of the Currency Number of National Banks Suggrentioua ftelatlTrt to the Increase of Note Issue. Washington, Dec. 2. The report of Hon. James H. Eckels, comptroller oi the currency, gives information in de tail in regard to the organization, su pervision and liquidation of the na tional banks for the year ended Octo ber 31, 1895, and similar information as far as obtainable relative to banks, banking companies and savings insti tutions organized and doing business under the laws of the several states and territories. The total number of national banks organized since the date the first cer tificate of authority was issued, June 20, 1863, to the close of the report year, has been 5,023, making a yearly aver age of 152. Of the number organized, there were in active operation on Oc tober 31 last 3,715, with, an authorized capital stock of $664,136,915, represented by 285,190 shareholders, or an average capital stock of $178,772 for each bank; average number of shares to each, 2,136, and of shareholders, 77. The total amount of their circulation out standing was $213,887,630, of which amount $190,180,961 was secured by United States bonds and $23,706,669 by lawful money deposited with the treas urer of the United States. During the report year forty-three banks were organized, located in twenty different states, with an ag gregate capital stock of $4,890,000. Of these new bf.nks, twenty-eight, with a capital stock of $2,530,000, are in the northern and northwestern section of the country, and fifteen, with a capi tal stock aggregating $2,360,000, in the south and southwest. The number of banks organized during the year was less than 30 per cent, of the yearly av erage. The comptroller recommends a num ber of amendments to the national banking law. In making suggestions relative to the increase of note issues, the comp troller uses the following language: The issuing of circulating notes to the par value of bonds deposited to secure the same and the reJucing of the per cent, of semi-annual tax levied upon such notes has been urged by all the secretaries of the treasury who have touched upon the subject at all and by every comptroller from the time of and includ Comptroller Knox. The provision of the law prohibiting the former and the provision of the law governing the amount of the latter, however, are still unchanged upon the statute book. At a time when the desire is so frequently expressed that there be a larger issue of bank notes and complaint is made that national banks are Indifferent to the note issuing func tion vested in them, it may well be considered by congress whether it would not be wise to do that which will make it of sufficient inter est to the national banks to pay greater at tention to note issues. The profit of banking in the United States is now largely in the de posit feature of it, and thus it Is of greater concern under existing circumstances to the banks to secure deposits than it Is to issue notes upon a return so small as to scarcely justify the expense and trouble entailed thereby. Banks are not eleemosynary institutions, and therefore engage only in that which prom ises a margin of profit. "While on the one hand entitled to no more favors than are granted to other corporations or enterprises carried on by associated individuals, on the other they should not be denied any privileges which they may justly claim, and for the de nial of which no possible excuse can be given. It is unquestionably true that national banks would largely increase their note circulation if the embarrassment arising from the need less locking up of a large part of their capital, available for other purposes, and the lessened profit through excessive taxation now imposed did not confront them. They certainly would do so if the legal tender issues of the govern ment were paid and cancelled and the channel now clogged by them freed for bank-note cir culation. The experience of this and other countries conclusively demonstrates that the best and most rational not3 issues are those put forth by banks. It likewise demonstrates that is sues made direct by government are always expensive, and under every circumstance a source of danger to such governmentsind loss to their people's business interests. No clearer proof of this could be had than that furnished by the difficulties which we have witnessed on the part of this government in its efforts to maintain the full credit of its practically lim itless amount of demand obligations. The advantage accruing to the government by the substitution of a bank note for a treas ury note currency would be immeasurably great. The need of maintaining a gold reserve to meet tho recurring demand obligations, now never retired, would, within a reasonable time, be obviated, and, delivered from this vexatious and expensive difficulty, the treas ury department could return to its legitimate function of collecting the revenues of the gov ernment needful to meet governmental ex penses and disbursing the same. With the relief gained to it through the re moval of this burden would come a greater one to the business interests of the individual citi zen, whose every operation would no longer be harassed by the uncertainty springing from a fear that either in the present or the future the currency obligations now forced by his government through the provisions of an in flexible law into the avenues of trade and com merce may be discredited and dishonored. The relegating of note issue entirely to the banks would give a better guarantee of meet ing the varying wants of trade, which is im possible with a legal mandate decreeing as amount of treasury issues of no greater and nl less volume at one season of the year than an other, whether or no there be a corresponding increase or lessening of the demand for cur rency to transact the business in hand. It is suggested in connection with the above that as a necessary element to the security of proper elasticity of issue in our bank-note currency sec tion 9 of the act of July 12, 1882, regu lating the retirement and issuing oi circulation to banks within a fixed period of time, should be repealed and also that Fuch amendment should be made to the law as will necessitate the banks keeping in the office of the comptroller of the currency a sufficient amount of bank notes as will enable them to secure circulation at once, in stead of after a period of delay, fre quently of sufficient duration as tc make the issue unavailable to relieve the pressure existing at the time ol ordering the same.

FAVORING SILVER. rhe Transmississippi Congress Closes It Work Free Silver Resolutions Adopted Omaha, Neb., Nor. 29. After five hours discussion of the financial issues the Transmississippi commercial con gress yesterday declared for the free and unlimited coinage of silver, 16 to 1 basis, and adjourned at 6 o'clock. The vote was 50 for gold, j 27 for silver. W.J. Bryan led the friends of the white metal, and J. L. Webster, of Omaha, the opposition. The debate was spir ited and participated in by most of the delegates. This resolution was finally adopted: Whereas, An appreciating money standard Impairs all contracts, bankrupts enterprises, makes idle money profitable by increasing its purchasing power and suspends productive forces of our people; and "Whereas, The spoliation consequent upon the outlawry of silver in the interest of the creditor class by constantly Increasing the value of gold, is undermining all industrial so ciety; therefore Resolved, That we demand the Immediate restoration of free and unlimited coinage of gold and sliver at the present ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation, such gold and silver coin to be alike a full legal tender of all debts, public and private. Mr. Webster, on behalf of the minor ity of the committee, presented the following: Resolved, That we are In favor of true bi metallism, which consists in the largest pos sible use of both gold and silver as the stand ard money of the country compatible with the lower of the nation to maintain the equal purchasing and debt-paying power of the two metals, that we are emphatically opposed to the free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, under present ex isting conditions: that such coinage would destroy the parity between the two metals; that the silver would drive the gold out of circulation, and thus destroy bimetal lism and produce silver monometallism: that we believe this long continued agitation of the silver question has had much to do with the present financial depression, producing want of confidence, threatening the stability and permanency of prices, and Is a constant men ace to the natkmal credit, exciting apprehen sions abroad and uncertainty at home. President Bryan asked unanimous consent to introduce the following me morial on behalf of the Nebraska dele gation: Whereas, We believe that an exposition of all the products, industries and civilization of the states west of the Mississippi river, made at some central gateway, where the world can behold the wonderful capabilities of these great wealth-producing states, would be of great value, not only to the transmissfssippi states, but to all the homeseekers in the world; therefore, be it Resolved, That the United States congress be asked to tako such steps as may be neces sary to hold a transmississippi exposition in Omaha during the months of August, Septem ber and October, In the year 1898, and that rep resentatives of such states and territories in congress be requested to favor such an appro priation, as is usual in such cases, to assist in carrying out this enterprise. Resolutions were also adopted in fa vor of a congressional appropriation for defending the harbor of San Diego by war vessels and fortifications; for the improvement of waterways, and for a deep water harbor at San Pedro. A long resolution urging the various state governments to take legislative action relative to irrigation was sub mitted and passed. Salt Lake was selected as the next place of meeting and the body adjourned permanently at 6 o'clock. ON THE
