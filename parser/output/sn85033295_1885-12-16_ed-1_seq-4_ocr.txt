I Seyublicmf. - WATERTOWN. WIS., DECEMBER 16. 1885. The Grand Army of the Republic has selected Washington as the site of the proposed Grand Army monument to General Grant. REPUBLICAN pest masters who still have their heads on their shoulders are now safe until the adjournment of the senate, unless their terms should expire before that time. A Democratic paper says that by the change in the Navy department, “the long line of Bories, Thompsons, Robesons and Chandlers has come to an end.” That is true, but the worst of it is that a line of Whitneys has begun. Ira Davenport, the defeated Repub lican candidate for governor of New York, was not left out in I lie cold. He is a member of the house o! representatives in congress, and ma lea lucky draw of a seat among Ir.s political friends. During the last four years under Re publican rule the principal of the public debt has been paid at the rate of $74,- 000,000 per year. The president in his message informs us that during the last five month? “there has been paid on the public debt $369,823." It needs no comment. He might, however, have added that during a single month the public debt increased neaiiv At the meeting of the slate grange, held at Madison last week, the following officer.? were elected and installed far the ensuing year: Master —S. C. Carr. Milton: Overseer—E. J. Williams, Danville: Lecturer— John F. Eervin, Trempealeau; Steward—W. A. Sprague, Reedsburg; Assistant steward—J. V. Smith, Sparta; Chaplain—T. M.

Huxley, Neenah: Lady assistant steward—Mrs. H. E Sprague, Reedsburg; Executive committee—John Whittet, Bussey ville. General Logan’s purpose to oppose the confirmation of officials appointed in place of veteran* who have been removed without cause is to be commended. If what he has to say on this subject should be said in open session so much the bet ter. The country docs not desire any factious opposition on the part of the senate to the president’s nominations, but it does expect that body to uphold civil service reform principles and to piotest against the violation of the spirit or the letter of the statute which declares that Union veterans shall be preferred in the civil service.— New York Tribune, The Republican Leader of the House. —Washington Correspondence Cleveland Leader: I saw Tom Reed to day. What an immense man he is! He is nearly six feet high, and his frame must weigh considerably over 200 pounds. He will be the leading Republican speak er during the next session, and he is pointed out as the Republican leader. There is no man in congress, or, indeed, in public life, unless it be Senator In galls, of Kansas, who has so keen a wit as Tom Reed. There is not one except Ingalls who approaches him in bitter sarcasm and cruel thrusts at an adver sary. He has a most tantalizing manner when he gets into a quarrel on the floor of the house, and he does not care if he wounds his enemies so deeply that they carry the scars to their graves. “When my horses were sick with what was called luntr fever, last spring, I gave them Simmons Liver Regulator (liquid) in one ounce doses twice a day. They all recovered speedily. E. T. Michener, PropT Michener’s Express, Jenkiotowu, Pa. To the demaud made that the senate should elect a Democrat as its presiding officer on the ground that at the last election the people “declared in favor of a Democrat,” the Utica Herald says: “The people declared in favor of nobody in November, 1884. At that election 10,048,151 vote were cast, of which the Cleveland and Hendricks electors receiv ed 4,913,853; the Blaine and Logan electors 4,847,655. The Prohibition and Butler tickets got 286,647 votes. Cleve land and Headricks, therefore, lacked lacked 220,445 votes of being the popular choice. By the machinery of law a plurality elects, and by legal methods, despite the populai will rather than by it, Mr. Cleveland became president and Mr. Hendricks vice-president.” Further: “What right has the administration to ap peal for courtesy to Republicans? Mr. Cleveland's title rests upon the votes of states where the right of suffrage was trampled upon, and partisan organization set up a despotism which nullified the will of thousands of citizens. It rests besides upon the electoral votes of New York, where the majority Was not beyond question, and where at least in the chief city the partisan bosses extorted results which the people did not desire.” The habitual use of pills is a sure means of untimely undermining health and laying the foundation for some of the most distressing cases of chronic maladies.

Day’s Horse Powder is without a peer for distemper, loss of appetite and general debility. Literary experts in Washington claim to have discovered that Secretary Bayard wrote the first half of the president’s message—all of that relating to foreign affairs; while Miss Elizabeth Rose Cleve. land, the president’s sister, dished up the Mormons, and in many other places in the document introduced her peculiarly involved literary style. From the com plicated verbosity of the paper it seems not unlikely that Postmaster General Vilas revised and padded it before it was sent to the press. —Postmaster General Vilas has made an order fixing the fees on international money orders on and after the first of next January, as follows: For sums not exceeding $lO, 10 cents; oyer $lO and not exceeding S2O, 20 cents; over S2O and not exceeding S3O, 30 cents; over S3O and net exceeding S4O, 40 cents; over S4O and not exceeding SSO, 50 cents. This is a reduction of one-third of the present rates paid by remitters for such orders. —Two farmers were not long since discussing their local paper. One said he thought it had too many advertise meats in it. The other responded, “in my opinion llie advertisements are far from being the least valuable part of it. I look them over carefully every week and I save at least five times (he cost of mv paper each year through the business advantages which I get from them.” Said the other, “1 believe you are right— J know that they pay me well and I rather think it is not in very good taste to find fault with the advertisements af ter all.” Those men have the right idea of the maDer. It pays any man who has a family to support, to take his lo cal paper for the sake of the advertise, ments if nothing more.— T Vhitexcater Rcjist er. A Walking SkeLton. E.
