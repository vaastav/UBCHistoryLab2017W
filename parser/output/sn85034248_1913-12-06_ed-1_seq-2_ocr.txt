So Say We All. The seven officers and directors of the Bank of Donaldsonville who were ordered arrested and placed un der bond for violation of the state 5bankilg law' are all honorable, up right and conscientious gentlemen, and if in erring they violated a law, we know nothing was further from their intention than fraud. They are the victims of circumstances and con ditions,, and their error,. if error they were guilty of, was of the mind and not of the heart.-Thibodaux Com mercial-Journal. 

'GOING FOR" THE SUGAR TRUST. Approximately 130 suits have been filed by Louisiana sugar producers in the United States district court at New Orleans against the American Sugar Refining Company, claiming damages aggregating over $100,000, 000 for alleged, violations of the an ti-trust law. The allegations are practically identical in all the petitions and are based on the general presumption and belief that the defendant company, commonly known as "the sugar trust," deliberately and unlawfully conspired to depress the price of su gar and succeeded in compelling the plaintiffs to sell their crops for sev eral seasons at less than the real market values. Among the numerous plaintiffs are several from this parish, including the Lemann Company, Meyer Lem ann and others, Geo. B. Reuss, and the Belle Helene Planting and Manu facturing Company, whose claims foot up over $5,000,000. All parts of the sugar-producing re gion of the state are represented in this litigation, the progress of which .wvil be watched with general and absorbing interest. AN EXPOSITION OF BIG IDEAS. A red-hot campaign is being waged in New Orleans to raise a fund of $5,000,000 for the purpose of conduct ing an Exposition of Big Ideas next year, commemorative of the comple tion of the Panama canal and illus trative of the resources, products and advantages of New Orleans, Louisi ana and the Mississippi valley gen erally. This movement is under the direc tion of Herbert Kaufman, a genius in the line of promoting civic pride and effort, and he is backed by a combination representing all the city's commercial and civic organiza tions and the most prominent citi zens in all branches of business. No similar enterprise has ever been attempted on such an extensive and systematic scale in New Orle ans, and if it is successful in the matter of raising the required fund, the city will indeed have demonstrat '2d its right to be the site of an lx position of Big Ideas. A CRISIS TI-HAT CALLS FOR REL BLOOD AND BACKBONE. 'This community is now' passing through the most trying period of its existence. Not since the great ci4il war ravaged our land half a century ago, have men's souls been so sorely tried. A succession of disasters which has already left ruin and suffering in their wake, has now culminated in a calamity that has shaken to its foundation man's Laith in man. It is no time, howt.ver, to despond or despair., Out. of tile crucible of adversity must emerge a chastened but stronger manhood. Never was there such need to get together and strive shoulder to shoulder for the rehabilitation of our community. Now is the time to prove the stuff we are made of, whether we are real men; or weaklings. There is much to do; much that can be accomplish ed. Above all, the promised locks at the head of Bayou Lafourche CIA and MUST be secured. In this matter we are not only sleeping on our rights, but we are forgetdful of our plain duty to our community and to our children whoi follow us. Let us but make up our minds to hammer on this subject day 'nd night and never rest until we ihave had justice done, and we can notl fail of success. Only let the men higher up understand that we are now, dead in earnest, and they will no longer shirk their legal and bounden duty. 'flhe success of our first inter-par ish fair taught us what harmonious and energetic action will accomplish. If we brace 'a and carry the same determined s rit into our efforts to -seckire th4 locks and other things wJhich we need and can get and i MUST get if we expect to press for- ! ward, our present misfortunes will soon be but memories of the past f A PROPER CASE FOR SUSPEN SION OF PUBLIC JUDGMENT. It is a matter for deep regret that the failure of the Bank of Donaldson villc, besides entailing heavy loss to the depositors and stockholders and inflicting much injury upon the busi ness and credit of the community at large, has furnished sufficient basis in the judgment of the state bank -on-!lhinler for a criminal lpr.secution of the presid.nt, vice president, cash ier and four members of the ruined beanks board of directors. in justice to all concerned, how ever, the facts should be borne in mind that a mere accusation is not o i.r accepted as proof of the exist e-nce or commllission of a crime, and that every accused is entitled under our laws and according to the spirit of common justice and humanity, to be presumed innocent until his guilt is established by competent evidence after a fair trial of his case. The presumption of innocence in the present instance is particularly strong by reason of the high standing and irreproachable character which all of the seven defendants in these prosecutions have maintained for many years-in this community. They have been prominent and useful citi zens, doing much for the upbuilding and improvement of the town and parish. Most of them have been ad vanced to important positions in civ ic life and fraternal circles, and have never failed to "make good" and to discharge every duty incumbent up on them in an entirely capable and satisfactory manner. Furthermore, the bank with which they were con nected has ever stood as a staunch friend to the town, and a large part of the many substantial improve ments accomplished here in past years can be justly credited to the good offices of this institution in a financial way. Add to these considerations the justifiable inference that the charges against the accused officials are more technical than otherwise, and it would seem that this is pre-emi nently a proper case for a suspension of public judgment until such time as a full and searching investigation has been made by means of a trial in court. The Chief earnestly hopes that the outcome of such a test will exonerate the accused of any inten tional wrongdoing. 

CONGRESS AND THE PRES IDENT'S MESSAGE. The longest continuous special ses sion of the United States congress on record came to an -end last Mon day noon and was immediately fol lowed by the opening of the regular session. Officers having been elect. ed and committees appointed dur ing the special session, both houses were in readiness to resume the rou tine of business without interrup tion or delay. In pursuance of the policy mapped out for himself at the beginning ol his administration, President Wilson read his annual message to the sen ate and house of representatives in joint session on Tuesday. The com munication was unusually brief, it: reading occupying only twenty-eight minutes, and both the matter it con tained and the manner of its pre sentationi" elicited hearty manifesta tions o~a proyal and applause from the audience, irrespective of political alignment. President Wilson avoided the prac tice of his predecessors in devoting a great part of their messages to inarters of routine that are presented in the reports of the heads of the ,arious departments of the govern ment, and confined himself to topics of general scope and specific subjects upon which legislative action is nec essary or desirable. The Mexican situation is given precedence as one of the most im portant problems confronting the country. The Huerta regime is characterized plainly as a military usurpation that is bound to crumble, and President Wilson expresses the belief that our present policy of watchful waiting should be continued, and that an early restoration of con stitutional and orderly government in Mexico will transpire. Currency reform is urged and leg islation recommended for a system of rural credits, reinforcement of the Sherman anti-trust law, selection of presidential candidates by primary elections, territorial government for Alaska, better conservation of nation al resources, 'and a fair and effective employers' liability act. The president thinks we can bind Hawaii and Porto Rico firmly to the United States through the forms of territorial or state government, but that the Philippines present a differ ent problem, only to be properly solved by the gradual relinquishment of the control of the islands to the Filipino people as they develop and improve their capacity for intel !igent and efficient self-government. The message contained an approv ing reference to the internation al conference being held at London for the consideration of plans look ing to the greater safety of ships at sea and betterment of conditions un der which crews of vessels are em ployed, and the president closed with an expression of the pleasure he has experienced in co-operating with con gress in the common service and his admiration for "the diligence, the good temper, and the full comprehen sion of public duty which has already been manifested by both of the houses." 

SAME HERE. The esteemed Assumption Pioneer remarks that the newspapers of the state are with one accord praising the members of the constitutional coulnvention of 1913 for the highly sat isfactory manner in which that body acconmplished its allotted mission, :and the Pioneer takes occasion to b:.d out a merited meed of com nlendation to Hon. John Marks, the Assumption delegate, for his share in the good work. ]this reminds us to say that As cension's representative, Hon. R. N. Sims, is eminently deserving of a similar tribute. He served as a mem ber of the style and revision com mittee, one of the most important of the convention's committees, took a prominent part in all the discussions and deliberations, and was a leader in the fight for the adoption of the anti-trust ordinance which is a nota ble antd invaluable addition to the state's ormganic law. So The Chief can cordially join the chorus of the Louisiana press sing ung the praises of the representatives )f the respective parishes in the con ;titutional convention, and respond or Ascension, "Same here! A TIMELY SLUI N ANOTHER OPTIMIST FURNISHES INSPIRATION TO THE PEOPLE OF DONALDSONVILLE. 'Deposit at Home" Should be the Watchword, ..s Well as "Buy at Home." Not less inspiring and encouraging to this community than the fine let .i" from President E. P. Brady of the Alluvial Land Purchase Company printed in last week's Chief, is the following communicatjon from George \W. Reese, president of the St. Elmo and Belle Helene railroad. Everybody should read what he says: "New Orleans, La., Nov. 26, 1913. "Editor Chief, Donaldsonville, La. "Dear Sir:-Anyone who thought the suspension of the Bank of Don aldsonville would have an infavorable effect on the other two Donaldson viile institutions would have had to revise that opinion had he looked in at- either the - People' Bank or the Bank of Ascension Monday morning, "When I dropped in to open an ac count with the People's on Monday, I found really a crowd on hand-not drawing out, but making deposits, and many of those present were new ac counts like myself. I am told the same agreeable condition of affairs prevailed at the Bank of Ascenson. "While, of course, the closing of the doors of the Bank of Donaldson ville is an occurrence to be regretted, there is much encouragement in the fact that the remaining institutions enjoy the confidence of the Donald sonville public, and that no one, ap parently, has been tempted to re move his deposits to any other bank ing center. "Certainly there is no end for a merchant or business man to gain by sending his money away from his home tiown; in fact it is just the other way around. All the "buy at home" arguments might be applied with equal weight to the "deposit at home" principle. Banking-by-mail is just as much of a detriment to local interests as is the mail-order busi ness, and for almost the same identi cal reasons. "All credit to Donaldsonvilie, there fore, that in a condition like the present, its people have shown their loyalty' to their home institutions in such a substantial and convincing manner. I believe the close of this crop season will find Donaldsonville and the surrounding territory in bet ter financial, condition than they have been for some time past. "Yours very truly, "GEO. W. 

REESE." Mr. Reese is a bopster, a hustler and an optimist of the first water, who has shown his faith in the fu ture destiny of Donaldsonville and Ascension parish by deeds and works that speak for themselves and leave no room for cavil or doubt. He planned and conducted the poul try show held at St. Elmo last Sun day, which proved successful despite the bad weather and will no doubt exert much influence for good on the poultry industry of this section, and this is. but one of numerous instances i:n which he has sought to promote: and upbuild local interests. Anything such a citizen says with regard to the affairs and prospects of the community is entitled to fair consideration and full credence; and the plea he makes for the support of home business and home institutions is so forcible in its simplicity that it should command instant and cordial concurrence among all classes and conditions of our people. "Buy at home" and "Bank at home" are good watchwords for the hour. Every dollar spent here is go ing to help a bit toward overcoming business depression and restoring the confidence and activity essential to the recouping of past losses and the laying of a foundation for future profits. Doubts, fears and repinings can do no possible good. It is up to us all to be cheery, hopeful and confident like Messrs. Brady and Reese. District Court. The exception of no cause of ac tion in the suit of B. Mistretta et .a,s. vs. A. Falsetta et als. was ar gued before Judge Charles Wortham last Saturday forenoon and taken under advisement. Counsel for de fendants offered a written motion to set aside the injunction, which was ordered filed. Counsel for plaintiffs )bjc:.ted to the filing of the motion on the ground that it came too late, and 'by consent the matter was fix ed for argument on Dec. 3. The lit igants are members of the local Italian Benevolent Society, and the squabble involves the seating of the officers iecently elected, the plain tiffs having enjoined the defendants from assuming the offices -to which .liy w-re named. At Wednesday's session of court, the case of Stella Smith vs. Joe Millet was taken up on confirmation of default, and judgment rendered in favor of plaintiff, granting her an absolute divorce. In the suit of Mistretta vs. Falsetta, the exception of misjoifnder and no .cause of action was overruled, and the injunction modified so as to restrain A. Fal setta from performing the duties of president of the Italian Society on ly until such time as he shall have been duly and legally inducted and installed in such office by the prop er authorities of the society, after which time he shall be no longer re strained. As thus modified!, the in junction will remain in "force and ef feet, until the final decision of the muerits of the case.
