SHOOT EVERY MAN "Death to Americans" Is Order Issued by Zelaya. The Warnings of His Officers Are Unheeded. AMERICAN WARSHIPS In the Harbor of Corinto Xow Number Four. Ticksburg Will Go to Panama for Supply of Coal. New Orleans. Dec. 9. A cabl- to the Picayune from Panama says: "Death, to Americans" is the order is sued to the army by President Zelaya. Positive information was re ceived here today that more than a month ago Zelaya issued instructions to his military commanders to shoot every American caught fighting in the army of the revolutionists. Some of Zelaya's military officers protested against this crder and warned him that trouble with the United States would result. The gunboat Vlcksburg, which has been stationed at Corinto ever since the Nlcaraguan trouble assumed an acuta stage, has been reinforced and there are now four American warships in the Corinto harbor. Then Vlcksburg needs coal and now that reinforcements have reached Corinto he will probably come to Panama to replenish her fuel supply. The ilonduran Situation. New Orleans, Dec. 9. There is no intention on the part of the enemies of President Davila .ot Honduras to attempt to overthrow his government now, according to Dr. Fausto Davila of Guatemaia, a cousin of the presi dent, who recently arrived here from Central America Dr. Davila said: "Davila shows that he is afraid by declaring martial law. His fears are groundless. There Is no notion of try ing to overthrow him at present. Gen eral Bonilla, the former president of Honduras, who, it is asserted, would lead a movement against Davila, Is living quietly near Stammcreek, Brit ish Honduras. "The country is ripe for a change but It will not come yet. The effect of martial law will be to allow Davila to further wriak his vengeance on his political enemies. I am informed he has already taken steps to this end." What London Hears About It. London, Dec. 9. The United States government has demanded, formally, the resignation of President Zelaya of Nicaragua, according to a cablegram frQtn Nicaragua received by a business house here today. The message adds that this information was communi cated by Zelaya himself, who said that his resignation from the presidency probably would take effect at the end of December. Denial and Doubt.' Washington, Dec. 9. The state ment telegraphed from Nicaragua to London that the United States had demanded the resignation of Presi dent Zelaya and that he had indicated his purpose to retire by the end oft the present month, is declared at the state department to be without foundation. The story frbm Panama via New Orleans, that some time ago Presi dent Zelaya had Issued an order rhat all Americans captured while 3erving with the revolutionary, army should be put to death is discredited here. The officials do not believe President Zelaya would thus court his own un doing and the certain overthrew of his government by armed forces of the United States by issuing such an order. Developments in Nicaragua are awaited with great interest by officials here, for it is not doubted that within the next few days or weeks at the farthest, a crisis will be reuched which will determine the fate of the Zelayan government. The Tacoma Shifts Her Position. Washington, Dec. 9. The cruiser Tacoma is today returning from Cris tobal to Port Union, Costa Rica, ac cording to advices received at the navy department.

Berlin Newspapers Comment I'avor bly Upon the Document. Berlin, Dec 9. Official and journal istic comment on President Taf t's message to congress notes with ap proval what he says regarding the un likelihood jf trade wars between the United States and other countries as a consequence of the maximum duties clause of the new tariff law. The Tageblatt, which represents financial and radical opinion, con cludes a two column review by calling the message a friendly one. Mr. Taft's utterances respecting Nicaragua, though considered in offi cial quarters as rather vague, are taken to mean that the United States will restore order in the republic, an outcome which will be to the advantage of German trade and German posses sions there. All commentators observe that the message deals with foreign affairs to an extent hither not done in a presi dent's message to congress, indicating that the interests abroad of the United States are expanding' and coming into contact with .European politics, espe cially as they concern China, Canada and Belgian Congo.

FACED ABOUT. MacVeagh Says Republican Party Has Changed Front on Tariff. Boston, Dec. 9. That the Re publican party has changed front and is now marching toward lower tariff in Which movement the Payne tariff bill is but an incident was the state ment made by Secretary Franklin MacVeagh at the annual banquet of the Massachusetts Bankers' associa tion. Secretary MacVeagh said: "In considering the results of the recent tariff it is indispensable to keep two important factors in mind. The first is that the Payne law is but an Incident in a tariff movement by and within the Republican party; the second Is that it is the resultant effect on th movement which it is import ant to take into account and nothing else. "No one expected this great move ment to complete itself in a single act of legislation and it was expected to be clear that the legislation enacted last August did not end the movement for tariff revision. "There is one great fact that makes a new tariff epoch that is the Re publican party has changed its front. Whereas it has been marching toward higher and higher tariff, it ha3 now faced about. It has recognised changed conditions." GOES TO SEE GOMPERS. President of Switchmen's Cnlon Seeks Federation Help. St. Paul, Dec. 9.

COAL HEATS GAS OFFICE Gas Company Compelled to Heat Office With Coal. Emporia, Kan.. Dec. 9. The ex treme end of the gas limit was reached here when Carl Nation, manager of the local gas company, was forced to buy coal to keep the sris office warm. When consumers got on the line the gas began going down and the pressure was de cidedly on the blink. Most of the day It was practically null, and there was much switching back to good old dirty coal. Many consumers are in favor of Superin tendent Wilson's plan of having part of the consumers return to other fuel till more wells are brought in. but also they are in favor of letting the other fellows be the ones to cult.

That John A. Heydler may not even receive a nomi nation for the National league presi dency when the magnates gather in New Tork next week is the announce ment made by Barney Dreyfuss, presi dent of the Pittsburg club, and one of the most ardent supporters of the man who had served In the leading executive position since j the suicide of Harry Pulliam. "Unless Stanley Roblson comes to the front and declares himself for the present incumbent, Heydler's name will not be put up either by Garry Herr mann or myself," said Dreyfuss. "We both feel that he is too good a man to be defeated, and if Robison would go with the Tklurphy-Brush-Ebbets-Fogel crowd it would mean five votes against Heydler, and sure defeat. , , FOR

GAS 

ISOTL LOW Zero Weather and No Belief Is Promised Today. Pumps at Headquarters Are Do- ' . ing Their Best. AT FULL CAPACITY. Secretary Morgan Says That No More Can Be Done. The Coal Supply Is Also Run ning Short. . At 2' o'clock this afternoon J. E. Morgan, secretary of the local gas company, stated that on account of the moderating weather the gas sit uation was being relieved. He anti cipated less trouble tonight than was the case Wednesday night and hoped that the worst -was over. He stated that nothing had been heard from the outside, but that with warmer weath er there would be more gas and more gas would mean less complaint. He repeated his statement that Topeka was getting all the gas that could be furnished at this time but that he hoped when the improvements which have been under way In the gas fields were completed there would be no further cause for a gas shortage this winter. He was inclined to place the blame for the present shortage on the fact that the improvements being made in the fields had not been com pleted. Pumps Working to Limit.. Mr. Morgan's statement made a mo ment later, when asked if he had any news from the gas fields, contains little news of a cheering nature for those who have shivered over cold stoves and furnaces for the last three days. "I believe the pumps are giving us the maximum amount of gas they can give us at this time," said Mr. Mor gan. "I do not believe it is possible for them to give us any more gas than we are getting just n6w. I think that after while they will be able to give us more gas than they can at this time. But at this time I nelieve it is impossible. We are getting all we can get. Conditions may be such, and I am inclined to think this Is the case, that we cannot be furnisht-d the maximum amount of the capacity of the pumps.". , Mr. Morgan could not say when it might be possible to give Topeka people more gas, further than to declare it would be "later on." And the situation for today is not to be relieved, accord ing to the information that can now be obtained. Mayor Green says there is no help for Topeka, that there is no wav of compelling the gas company to furnish gas to.Jts,cQngumera.Artific'al gas could not be used in the pipes and burners now in use and if it could be the rate is : prohibitive. Artificial gas costs $1.25 per thousand feet -and there is now no way of supplying it to .the consumers and four times as much ar tificial as natural gas is required for heating purposes. The houses are not prepared to use the manufactured product. Neither could the present plant manufacture enough gas to sup ply the demand. With the temperature risimr there is less gas used and with the supply at just what it has been there is more gas for the consumers. . Consequently the condition today is far less serious than for three days. There is now hope that the situation will not be so serious to night and after today it is believed the gas situation will right itself because of the warmer weather coming. The temperature rose rapidly today and the wind shifted from the north west, from which direction it has been blowing for three days, to the south east. This indicates rising temperature and the mercury rose from 1 degree be low zero Just before 7 o'clock to 14 above at 2 o'clock. The white blanket of snow which covers the state will cause this rise to be. less rapid than would otherwise be the case but the backbone of the cold spell is broken again and warmer weather is coming, according to the weather man. And it Is well that such a condition exists. This morning the gas pressure started toward the bottom again with sickening rapidity but as the weather grew warmer the pressure arose. The situation at noon was not as bad as on the preceding two days, although it was still far from satisfactory. The coal men, who have been busy for the last three days, announced last night that they did not have enough coal to last another 48 hours. Coal in shipment was being held at Kansas City and an other 48 hours of extreme cold weather, such as has prevailed for the past three d ays, would have resulted in a situation desperate indeed. There has been the greatest and most rapid rise in the temperature today that has been recorded since Saturday. Following are the horuly temperatures: 7 o'clock 0 I 11 o'clock.. 9 8 o'clock 2 I 12 o'clock 12 9 o'clock . 3 I 1 o'clock 12 10 o'clock ' 6 I 2 o'clock 14 The wind shifted to the northeast between 9 and 10 o'clock and between 10 and 11 o'clock shifted again, this time to the southeast. . It is blowing 6 miles an hour. There was a serious shortage of gas last night, it having gone completely out in many cases. Hospitals and private dwellings were cold in the early part of the evening. Later the gas came up but this morning the usual cold weather conditions pre vailed and people shivered and won dered when the weather would mod erate. More houses were equipped for the use of coal as a result. Some of the people living on the west side spent the night with friends living east of Kansas avenue, tne gas snort- age being less marked on the east side. 

SPEAKS FOR LIQUOR. Preacher Says the Trade in It Is as Legitimate as Any. , New, York. Dec. ' 9. The Rev. Dr. William Wasson of Rlverhead, L. I., was the principal speaker at. the an nual dinner of the American Wine Growers association here. , . ( . . . "I think the liquor business as legi timate a trade as any," he said. "The prohibitionists have declared war upon every oranch of the liquor trafPc. They think that by calling everything rum they will give the business a bad name. The movement has much of froth and hypocrisy. ' : ' -; "For 60 years a great religious de nomination has been teaching us that the use of any alcohol is a sin. This doctrine is a menace to the industrial and moral welfare of our people, but the fault for its widespread popularity lies largely with ministers who detest the pronibition movement, but do not make their opinions pablic. Four fifths oi the clergymen of my denom ination are opposed to prohibition, al though they favor a sane temperance. People are following the prohibition n-ovemenit because they have been mis led by misrepresentation and fraud. Ninety-five per cent of those who use liquor use it temperately. "The government should attempt to popularize the lighter alcoholic bever ages. The American wine growers axe producing our best temperance drink." BIG AVIATION MEET.
