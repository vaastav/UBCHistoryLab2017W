"It has called into use expedients for putting ft into circulation of very questionable, propriety.

BROTHER BEN'S MESSAGE. If Its Recommendation Are Carried Ont the Surplus Will He a IJead Issue. . As usual in. reneral. messages from tho Executive Ollice President Harrison commences with a perfunctory narrative , cj tt)C relations of the Kepublie with other nations of the earth. It is tho contribution of the State Department to the body of the message and contains little that is important or instructive. I It is seldom that an Executive in a gen I eral message departs from recognized routine. Lincoln did it when tho men i ace of rebellion was upon us. ClevelamL did it when lie wished strongly to emphasize his conviction that the para mount need of the country was tarih re form. I!ut, pursuing the old lines, President Harrison opens with a couple of columns descriptive of the status of our affair with foreign lands, in all of which, since we are at peace with the world, there is little of genuine interest. For tlie rest the message, save as tlie President's view lias been changed by recent elections and liy Department ri . ports, is a restatemeut of his letter of iicoeptane'ti and ilis speech On the -1th' of i March last after taking the oath of ollice. , The obligations of his office make him more solicitous about the evil effects of ' a Treasury surplus than when he was ,'a candidate. The surplus for the last ' - - - - i . .joar was in round mil. m-k . i ,,. "t! ""' d. siirpnr, mimlcrs S7,OtMt,00n. for the next year is 51S.000.0OJ. As a matter of fact this limy be fal.iliod, and it is altogether likely that it will, for when Con gress will have made its appropri ations it is not likely that tlie show ing will be quite so rosy. Tno President MpeaKS upon t:ns iiuestlon as it lie were ' Cleveland himself, save tiiat his rec- omniendations are not so logical, lie would have tho internal tax on tobacco removed. He would have the free list ' of tlie custom-houses enlarged, lie would have the tariff revised; but lie would bave the protective feature re tained in revising the schedules upon all articles of domestic manufacture, and is particularly solicitous upon paper that farm products shall come in for a share of nrectioli. .lu.t how this can be I done lie doesn't stop to say.

He cannot be bune fited in any other way. Passing from tho report of the Secre tary of the Treasury tlie President treats of a variety of subjects in a perfunctory way. He wants tlie law for the exclu sion of Chinese re"nd'ered more efficient. He wants coast defenses improved and discriminating appropriations made for i i i if i rivers and harbors. He recommend legislation for ' intermediar.y 1'cdcral f ineronsnil invomnt of disleict tourts, lni ri aseu pajment Ot lllstllct judges and greater protection for Ted- (jral judges and witnesses summoned thereto. A small paragraph against trusts is followed by a recormnendation , . that an international copyright law bo pass(.. th -ft a Xatiobal bankrupt law be 1 . , . . .. . . ,. , enacted and that thonaturaluatlondaWS be so amended as to guard against ad mitting to tho privileges of citizonshtp aliens who can no' be tf.rstcd.

Con cerning the District of Columbia it is asserted that "tho laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks should bo re vised with a view to bringing tho traffic under stingent limitations and control," which wHl bo taken by jesters as a sly thrust at our amiable ice-i re sident mine host of the Slioreham, and its at 1 tractive buffet. , While recommending tho World's Fair he prudently refrains, of course, from i naming a particular city. . . I The negro nrnV thn'VivJJ service are taken eare of in the usual method. The message, having recouunendi' dMihsidies "for ocean mail"serice between our ports and South and ( eptral America, closes with a suggestion which was not needed that Congress mustn't mistake c!iee?e paring for economy. When Congress will have voted large additional sums for pensions, for education, for coast defonse, ' for naval'- increase, for subsi dies, there, will be no further need for the President's solicitude about the sur plus. That will disappear as 'totally'as" th(ikst tribes of Israel anil,iho cmbaiv rassment will not lie, as in Llevelanils day. to find means of reducing tho rev enue, but to devise ways of increasing taxation.
