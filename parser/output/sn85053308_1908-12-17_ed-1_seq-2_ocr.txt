ROOSEVELT TO THE LAWMAKERS President Says Financial Stand' ing of Nation Is Excellent —Taxes Reduced. Repeats Recommendations Re* garding Corporations Doing Interstate Business. Many Matters Affecting Labor Are Called to the Atten tion of Congress. The following is a synopsis of the president's message to congress: The financial standing of the nation at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system is lmperfe'et. and it Is earnestly to be hoped that the cur rency commission will be able to pro pose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to Sept. 30. 1908, the balance between the not ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus of nearly $100,000,000 of receipts over expenditures, a reduc tion of the interest bearing debt by $90,000,000, in spite of the extraordi nary expense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. There huve been no new taxes; on the contrary, some taxes have been taken off; there has been a reduction of taxation. As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and es pecially the railroads. I can only re peat what I have al Corporations ready again and again said in my i messages to congress. I believe that under the interstate clause of the con stitution the United States has com plete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and I believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness, so as both to secure justice from, and to do jus tice to, the great corporations which are the most important factors in mod ern business. I believe that it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sher man anti-trust Ihav, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly And unequelly, and its enforcement Works almost as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead Of an unwise effort to prohibit all com binations, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit com binations which are in the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency of the national government full power of control and Supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity in all matters Which the pubic has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by judicial, but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of Improper favoritism or other wrong doing. The railroads of the country should be put completely under the interstate commerce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and con trol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of fates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent legislation. Power to make jombinations and traffic agreements Bhould be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the com mission being first gained and the com bination or agreement being published In all Its details. In the Interest of the public the representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so fcs to see that no injustice is done the railroads. The shareholders, the em ployes and the shippers all have inter ests that must be guarded. It is to the interest of all of them that no Swindling stock speculation should be Allowed, and that there should be no Improper issuance of securities. There must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of farmers and business men who ship freight, or callous dis regard of the rights and needs of em ployes. Rates must be made as low' as Is compatible with giving proper re turns to the shareholders; hoi they must not, for instance, be reduced in guch a fashion as to necessitate a cut m the wages of employes or the aboli tion of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies jngaged in interstate business should lie put under the Jurisdiction of the in terstate commerce commission. The fight against adequate govern ment control and supervision of indi vidual, and especially of corporate Wealth engaged in interstate business Is chiefly done under cover; and espe cially under cover of an appeal to State's rights. Forty or fifty separate State governments cannot exercise con trol over corporations doing business In most or all of tl> m. Such divided Buthority cannot regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central government Is the only power which without oppression, can thoroughly and Adequately control and supervise the large corporations. There Is legisla tion which the federal government g one can enact and which Is absolute ■ vital In order to secure the attain ment of our purpose. Many laws are heeded. There should be regulation by the national government of the freat interstate corporations. Including Si simple method of account keeping publicity, supervision of the issue of Securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short time franchises for all corpora tions engaged in public business, in cluding the corporations which get power from water rights. There should be national as well as state guardian ship of mines and forests. The labor legislation hereinafter referred to should concurrently bo enacted Into law'. To accomplish this, means, of course, a certain increase in the use of—not the creation of—poAver, by the central government. Tho power already ex ists; it does not have to be created; tho only question is whether it shall be used or left idle—and meamvhlle the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. Many matters affecting labor and the status of the Avage-worker are called to the attention of Labor. congress by the presi dent. A steady effort should be made, he says, to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men Avho w T ork with hand or Avlth brain shall oAvn a far greater share than at present of the Avealth they produce. As far as possible he hopes to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred by machinery, orgaplzatlon and division of labor, accompahled by an effort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage-worker of railway, mill and factory. The regulation of the national high Avays must be such that they shall serve all people Avith equal Justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer than at present for the man of small means to invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor; stock AA-aterlng should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as possible discouraged. There should be a pro gressive inheritance tux on large for tunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium on thrift, hard work and business energy. It is eminently right that the nation should fix the terms upon Avhich the great fortunes are in herited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those Avho in herit them in their entirety. The above is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of the reforms for Avhich avc should Avork. But there is one matter with w'hieh congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any paltering Avith the ques tion of taking care of the Avage-Avork ers who, under our present industrial system, become killed, crippled or Avorn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority of wage-Avorkers must have their rights scoured for them by state action; but the national goA'ernment should legis late In thoroughgoing and far-reach ing fa.<3)rton not only for all employes of the national government, but for all persons engaged in Interstate com merce. The object sought for could be achieA'ed to a measurable degree, as tar as those killed or crippled are con cerned, by proper employers' liability laAvs. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, definite steps toAA'ard proA'iding old-age pensions have been taken in many of our pri vate industries. To strengthen these practical measures should be our im mediate duty. When a workman is injured Avhat he needs is not an ex pensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through • Immediate administrative action. The law passed at the last session of congress granting compensation to cer tain classes of employes of the gov ernment should be extended to include all employes of the government and should be made more liberal in its terms. Congress should without further delay pass a model employ ers' liability law' for the District of Columbia. The president recommends that the prinoiple of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire work being car ried on by the goA'ernment. The president urges upon congress the duty of increasing the salaries now given our Judges. Beginning Courts. with the supreme court, he says, the judges should liaA'e their salaries doubled. It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays Avhich now obtain in the administration of justice, and Avhich operate with pe culiar severity against persons of small means, and fav'or only the \ - ery criminals whom It is most desirable to punish. These long delays In the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised. Our judicial system is sound and ef fective at core, and it remains, and must be maintained, as the safeguard of those principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation of American institutions. The presi dent thinks there is ground for the belief that substantial Injustice Is often suffered by employes in conse quence of the custom of the courts is suing temporary injunctions Avithout notice to them, and punishing for con tempt of court In instances Avhere, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. There is a widespread feeling that this sys tem often works great injustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their w'orking condition result In industrial disputes. A temporary Injunction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent injunction In causing disaster to the wageworker's side In such a dispute. Organized labor Is chafing under the Unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unAvisely expressed, and often improperly expressed, but there is a sound basis for Tt, and the order ly and laAV-abiding people of a com munity w'ould be in a far stronger position for upholding the courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be proA'ided against. Such proposals as advocated by some of the extreme labor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of the most offensive kind, and even if enacted into law would rightly be declared unconstitutional. The power of injunction Is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its abuse Provision should be made that no In junction or restraining order Issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result; and in such a case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed period, and. should forthwith lapse. Decisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimized In every way. If there Is any one duty which more than another we owe It to our chil dren and our children's Forests, children to perform at once, it is to Bave the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most important element in the conservation of the natural re sources of the country. Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we have already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and no measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo the mischief being done; and It would, be in the highest degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or tempo rary cost Interfere with such action, especially as regards the nationul forests whloh the nation can noAV, at this very moment, control. Nothing should be permitted to stand In the way of the preservation of the forests, and it Is criminal to permit individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves through the de struction of forests when this destruc tion is fatal to the Avellbeing of the whole country In the future. Action should be begun forthwith, during the present session of congress for the improvement Inland of our Inland water Waterways. ways—action which will result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rlA'ers. We have spent hundred's of millions npon these waterways, yet the traffic on nearly all of them Is steadily declining. This condition is the direct result of t*he absence of any comprehenslA-e and far-seeing plan of AvaterAvay Improvement. It Is poor business to spend money for inland navigation unless Ave get It. Until the work of river improve ment Is undertaken In a modern way it can not have results that will meet the needs of this modern nation. These needs should be met without further dilly-dallying or delay. The plan Avhich promises the best and quickest results is that of a permanent commission authorized to co-ordinate the work of all the government depart ments relating to waterAvays, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. The president urges that all our na tional parks adjacent to national for ests be placed com National pletely under the Parks. control of the forest service of the agri cultural department, Instead of leaving them as they now are, under tho in terior department and policed by tho army. 5 The pure food legislation has al ready worked a ben Pure Food. eflt difficult to over estimate. The president says that it lias been his purpose from the beginning of his administration to Indian Service, take the Indian service out of the atmosphere of political activity. The last remaining stronghold of politics In that service was the agency system, which has seen Its best days and Avas gradually falling to pieces from natu ral or purely evolutionary causes, but like all such survivals, was decaying slowly In Its later stages. It seems clear that its extinction had better be made final now, so that the ground can be cleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians, pre paratory to their Induction Into the full measure of responsible citizen ship. The president renews his recom mendation for postr* savings banks, for depositing Postal savings with the Savings Banks, security of the government be hind them. The object Is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of moderate means. Postal saA'ings banks are now in operation fn practically all the great civilized coun tries with the exception of the United States. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the Parcel Post, farmer and the country' storekeeper, and it is desirable that the routes, serA'ing more than 15,000,000 people should be utilized to the fullest prac ticable extent. The postmaster gen eral estimates that the revenue derived from the opration of such a system on all the rural routes would amount to many million dollars. The president urges that the request of the director of the census in connec tion with the decen Census. nlal work so soon to be begun, be com plied Avith and that the appointment to the census force be placed under the civil service law, waiving geographical requirements. It Is highly advisable that there should be intelligent action on the part of the nation on the Public Health, question of pre serving the health of the country, says the president, and he urgently recommends the passage of a bill which will authorize a redis tribution of the bureaus which shall best accomplish this end. The president recommends that leg islation be enacted placing under the Jurisdiction of the Government department of com Printing Office, merce and labor the government printing office. At present this office is under the combined control of the president and the joint committee of the two houses of congress. All soldiers' homes should be placed under the complete Soldiers' control of the war Homes. department. The immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states is ad vocated by the president. This should be done, he says, at Statehood. the present session of congress. The people of the two territories have made It evi dent by their votes that they will not come In as one state. The only al ternative Is to admit them as two, and this should be done without delay. The commercial and material prog ress of the twenty'Latin-American re publics Is worthy of the careful at tention of congress. Latin'Ameriean No other section of Republios. the world has shown a greater proportion ate development of its foreign trade during the last ten years and none other has more special claims on the Interest of tho United States. It . offers today probably larger pansion of our commerce than any other group of countries. Tho work on the Panama canal 1$ being dono with speed, efficiency amj entire devotion to duty, Avhich make it a model for all work Panama Canal, of the kind. No task of such mag* nltude has ever before been undertaken by any nation; and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The importance of those islands Is apparent, says the president, and the need of Improving their condition is urgent. The nation Hawaii. al goA'ernment must provide the neces sary harbor improvements on each Isl and, so that the agricultural products can be carried to the markets of thq Avorld. The coastwise shipping laws should be amended to meet tho special needs of the islands,. and the alien contract labor law should be so modi fied In Its application to Hawaii as to enable American and European labor to bo brought thither. The Filipino people, through their officials, are making real steps in tho direction of self-government. Under! tho present system The Philippines, of Just laws anil sympathetic admln-l Istration, we have every reason to be lieve that they are gradually acquiring the character which lies at the basis of self-government. The president trusts that within a generation tho time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for themselves whether It is well for them to become inde pendent, Or to continue under the pro tection of a strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the Island^ order at home and protection from foreign Invasion. The president again recommends tha| American citizenship Porto Rioo. be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico. In Cuba our occupancy will cease In about two months' time; the Cubans have in an orderly manner eleoted thel^ own governmental Cuba. authorities, and tho Islands will bo turned' over to them. Our occupation on this occasion has lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and pros pered under It. As regards the army the president calls attention to tho fact that while! our Junior officers and enlisted meq stand very high, tho The Army. present system of promotion by senior ity results in bringing Into the higher grades many men of mediocre capacity, who have but a short time to serve. The scope of retiring boards should bo extended so that they could consider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities, But this plan Is recommended only If congress does not see fit to provide what In the president's judgment is far better; that Is, for selection in promotion, and for elimination for age. Officers who fall to attain a certain rank by a certain age should be re tired. Noav that tho organized militia, the national guard, has been incorporated with the army as a National Guard, part of the national forces, it behooves the government to do eA'ery reasonable thing In Its power to perfect its effi ciency. It should be assisted in its in struction and aided more liberally than heretofore. There should be legisla tion to provide a complete plan for or ganizing the great body of volunteers behind the regular army and national guard Avhen war has come. Tho president approves the recom mendations of the general board for the increase of tho The Navy. navy, calling especial attention to the need of additional destroyers and colliers,! and above all, ef the four battleships. It Is desirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battle ships of the best existing type. Thai North Dakota, Delaware, Florida andi Utah will form the first division of thisi squadron. The four A'ossels proposed will form the second division. It will be an improvement on the first, th» ships being of the heavy, single cali ber, all big gun type. The president most earnestly recommends that <?ha general board be by Ihav turned into % general staff. There Is literally no ex cuse for continuing the present bureau organization of the navy. The nafy should be treated as a purely militajw qrganizatlon, and everything should be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. Nothing better for the navy front!, every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of the battle fleet around the Avorld. The improvement of the ships In every Avay has been ex traordinary, and they have gained far more experience in battle tactics than they would have gained if they stayed in Atlantic waters. The American people have cause for profound grati tude, both in A'ieAA' of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, and in vieAV of the improve ment the cruise has Avorked in this already high condition. Castro as He Is. There is a vivid portrait of Presi - dent Castro in an article on Venezuela In the November Atlantic, Avhich ap parently shoAvg him exactly as he is. Says the writer: "They were dancing the waltz, Avhich in Venezuela has a peculiar time all its own and more engaging, when I first caught sight of Gen. Clpriano Castro ricochet - ting from couple to couple, his collar Avilted, hl3 gray frock coat damp, and a Avlld light in his eyes. Caraquenians looked horrified and tried to keep out of his way, but could not. The spirit of the dance was unchained in him. As we watched, he dropped his part ner, waved to the musicians, who stopped and then began on a quaint air. Castro ran down the length of the loggia, separating rudely the dancers into two lines. He ran back, and, with a coat tail in each hand, be gan jigging ridiculously to the miistc. swaying right and left like an auto matic toy. The dance, some one whis pered, was *La Dansa,* a rustic enter tainment forgotten In Caracas. Some of those in the lines kneAV It well, and responded to Castro's swings and wagglngs by equivalent scrapes and jigs. But most did not, and confu sion followed. The little fellow fairly screamed with wrath. His face crew yellower and yellower. He seized women by their bare arms, Jerked them, whirled them, left the imprint of his fingers on their arms, and le&r na their faces. It was fear."
