ROOSEVELT SPEAKS WITH ROOT'S VOICE IN his utterances before the Pennsylvania Society in New York, i Secretary Root very plainly expresses the mind of his autocratic and impetuous chief. Mr. Root may possibly see fit to disavow | or modify the extremity of his views concerning the obliteration , of State rights and State lines, but these views are so plainly an j echo of the President's sentiments as expressed in his recent mes sage that \ve must accept the Secretary's declaration as officially in spired. Mr. Root's opinions are expressed in the following para graphs : If any State maintains laws so inconsistent with the standard of the nation as to violently derange the domestic relations which the majority of the States desire to preserve, that State is promoting the tendency of the people of the country to seek relief through the National Government and to press forward the movement for national control and the extinction of local control. It is useless for the advocates of State rights to inveigh against the supremacy of the constitutional laws of the United States or against the extension" of national authority in the fields of necessary control where the States themselves fail in the performance of their duty. Secretary Root is the inspired prophet of the present adminis tration. Among those who are near President Roosevelt a kind of Root superstition or myth has been cultivated. Those who have been privileged to sit under the drippings of the executive sanctuary cherish a belief in the almost supernatural wisdom of Mr. Root. To believe in Root was the way of salvation for the officeseeker, the officeholder and other varieties of political parasites. Among the less credulous it may have seemed that Root's wisdom was shown chiefly in the accurate reproduction of his masters voice. When Root proposes to obliterate the autonomy of the States he is traveling the same road as Theodore Roosevelt. Instances of the President's eagerness to magnify his office are plentiful in the recent message. There is, for example, the President's extraordi nary demand that he be given power to dismiss naval officers when he may see fit. He asks leave to substitute his will for the due process of law by court-martial. Like other impulsive, hasty people, he has the fullest confidence in his own wisdom, and this request is made* at the very moment when the public sentiment of the whole country has been aroused by his arbitrary dismissal of a company of negro soldiers without just cause. / The autocratic expressions of the President's message on the Japanese difficulty, his obvious neglect to inform himself on the merits and facts of the case and his hasty and ill-considered recom mendations, all point in the same direction. He would magnify his office and exalt the power of the Federal Government at the expense of the States. We quote his very remarkable recommenda tions on the Japanese trouble : •'.'\u25a0-; I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended as to enable the Presi dent, acting for the United States Government, which is responsible in our international relations, to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. Always the President! By what machinery shall the President enforce his interpretation of the law? Shall he sit as a court, first to decide the disputed points, or shall he hastily jump to a conclusion, as^he did in this particular matter, without informing himself of the facts? Having thus usurped the judicial function and arrived at a hot-headed conclusion, he would presumably, as he intimated in his message, call out the troops to dragoon people into compliance. Mr. Root would destroy the autonomy of the States and make the Federal Government supreme in all things. President Roosevelt is convinced that he ought to be the whole Federal Government, in his own person judge jury and executive. AYe have the highest respect and admiration for Theodore Roose velt as a patriotic and genuine American, but he is hot-headed and hasty, as well as afflicted with a grievous impediment in his reasoning faculty. He appears to be incapable of understanding the conse quences or bearing of some of the measures he recommends. 

HIBBS AND HIS "ILLUSIONS" UT\ LENTY of room inside. Move up there!" VJ The cars of the United Railroads are never crowded. The fJI people who imagine they have b£en hustled, and bustled and battered on tlfe street cars are vain dreamers, and maybe unprincipled persons as well. Counselor Moore would probably call them socialists^ but General Superintendent Hibbs, oh behalf of the company, is content to say that overcrowding is but a dream, a malicious dream perhaps, but yet a 'dream. Thus saith Hibbs : They have the" appearance of being overcrowded, it is true, but this is really an illusion. The fact is that a large proportion of the leisure; class is out of town at present, and those who ride on the cars are. for the greater part mechanics and laborers. These men like the open air and for that reason they have got into the habit of riding on the outside of the cars. That makes the cars look as if they were crowded, but really there is always plentiy of room inside. If you have had somebody walking on your toes or climbing down the back of your neck you may understand that the climber be longs to the leisure class, for otherwise he would be riding' on, the roof to gratify his love of fresh air. It is this uncontrollable. pas-: sion for fresh air that impels men to hang on the outside of- the cars by the skin of their teeth, and at imminent riskof. life. There'is plenty of room inside, and the apparent jam is; nothing more than an optical delusion, a traveling mirage. The delusion does, not extend to the nickels. There is a pot of gold at the tail end of Hibbs' rainbow. Any optical delusion who is kicked and- hustled and; trampled on'should be allowed to ride freehand asfor Hibbs, he is a;bqld^gax EDITORIAL PAGE humorist. But it is ticklish business joking With: people whose "illusions" make them see crowds in and on empty, cars. It would be painful and regrettable, indeed, and no joke at all, even for the merry Hibbs, if some of the dreamers of dreams should be afflicted with the "illusion" that Hibbs was a; punching bag.

The law of a properly constituted Vfight" trust should be ."Divide and conquer," but it seems that the brethren are throwing salt cellars and other domestic missiles at each other because some of them will not divide. It is related that rMr. Coff roth accuses. Mr. Graney of holding out, $5000/ ; ; Mr. Graney is by profession, if 'not by trade, an "honest blacksmith," who makes a living; by running a saloon and behaving as referee for prize fights. Mr.'Goffroth is not slow to say that Brother Graney is crooked, and he his remarks with flying crockery and other convenient missile weapons, accompanied by a demonstration in force with a' horse pistol of long descent.; The bewildered spectator might imagine in his innocence that battle, murder and sudden death was in! hand, that buckets of blood would flood the imminent deadly breach in the trust, in carnadine the stews and purlieus of the tenderloin and make some damp/ unpleasant corpses, but, there was really no cause for alarm. Hostilities were deferred because there was sickness in Brother Graney's family. When a man belongs to the "fight trust" he does not mind being called a thief, and immediately t moves for a contin uance of the debate, just as if his name were Abe" Ruef or Eugene Schmitz, who have set a shining example in that regard; resting content under the imputation of being blackmailers. ..In the lexicon of the "fight trust," fighting talk [does not mean 'fight, because' the gentlemen are neither proud nor- sensitive.

As it now stands Japa nese born in the United States are citizens by right "of birth, as is the case with American-born Chi nese; but public sentiment here Is firmly set against naturalizing the Orientals, and it is not likely that Con gress will look favorably upon admit ting Japanese to the full #lghts of America^ citizenship.. The President's attitude on the Japanese question will put his hitherto great popularity on the Pacific Coast to a severe test. — Salinas Index. - • : \u25a0 President Roosevelt's attitude on the Japanese question cannot be but offen sive to the' people of California, and especially to San Francisco. .In his message touching that question he use 3 but little diplomacy and goes at It roughshod.

The Pacific Coast will take exception to the President's remarks concerning the proper treatment of the Japanese, and it is likely- that almost or quit© every recommendation which the mes sage." contains "will find some, honest and vigorous opponents. ' Nevertheless, whether we like and approve every thing the President says or whether we disapprove of many things he says, we will all agree that the message is a strong, frank, vigorous document, such as a strong, fearless and clear-headed man. might be expected to write.— Bakersfleld Echo. Probably it was because of misinfor mation that the President gave utter ance to these misstatements. The Japanese have not been shut out from" the public schools in San Francisco, but they have"" been segregated from the American children. The complaint of the Japanese is — not that th*y are denied. an education — but that they are not received on terms of equality with the American , children. It seems a matter of individual taste as to whether the Japanese are' treated as equals. The President is wrong in claiming that the Japanese are opposed by American laborers because they .are efficient laborers. Their success as laborers lies in the fact that they work cheaper than the whites; that in competing with them the American laborer would have to abandon Ameri can ideals and that the Japanese who are working in this country are em ployed under as indefensible a system of peonage as tho Chinese* coolie is. — Grass Valley Union. .\u25a0 iWe.; regret that the President has chosen" to %be the - champion of , the Japanese^ immigrant.

Roosevelt is serving our Interests more directly' than those of any other part of the country when he writes a message which proves to the Japanese that the American nation is friendly, not hostile.
