In short no nation.in the tide of tlmc,has ever present <*jl A spectacle of greater material prosperitv. toon wc have done until a very recent period. 'Why Is it, then, that discontent nowextonsm . lJ prevails, and the union of the States, which Is the source of all these blessings, is threaten ed with destruction? The long continued and intemperate interference of the Northern peo ple with tbc question of slavery in the South' ern Stoics, has at length produced Its natural effects. The different sections of the Union arc now arrayed against each tdher, and the time has arrived so much dreaded by the Fath er of His Country, wher, hostile geographical parties have been fQVmcd. 1 have long fore seen, and often lorewamed, my conntrvmcn of the now impending danger. This does not proceed s<* 4 cly from the claim on the part of Congress ortbc Territorial Legislatures to ex clude slaverer {torn the Territories; nor from tbo efforts of different States to defeat the ex ecution of the Fugitive Slave Law. AU or anv of these evils might have been endured by the South, without danger to the Union,os others have been, in the hope that time and reflection might apply the The immediate peril antes, not so much from these causes, as from the fact that the violent agitation of r C *u i question throughout the North for the last quarter of a century, has at length iis malign Influence on the slaves, and inspired them with vague notions of free hcncc a sense of security no longer Clists aroand the family altar. This feel ing of peace al home lias given place to aj»- prehensious of senile insurrection. Many » matron throughout the South, retires'at nigh* m dread of what may befall herself and her children before the ’morning. Should thl-* apprehension of domestic danger, whether ren! or Imaginary, extend and intensify itself, until U shall pervade the masses of the Southern people, then disunion will be inevitable. Self preservation is the first law of nature, and ha been implanted !n the heart of man by hip Creator lor the wisest purposes, and no politi cal uniooj however fraught with blessings and benefits m all other respects, can - long con tinue, if the Decenary consequences be to ren der the homes uud firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly inse cure. Sooner or lot crlhc bonds of such a union ’must be severed. It is my comiction that tbit fatal period has not yet arrived, and my pntyei to God is that lie would preserve the Constitu tion and tbc Union tbroughoutiillgeneration*. Bat let ns take warning iu time uud remove the cause of danger. It cannot, be denied that • lor five and twenty years, the agitation against * u *l le South, has been incessant, in IdJj, pictorial hand-bills and inflammatory aj peals were circulated extensively throughout the South, of a characterto excite tbc passion?- of the slaves—and in the language of Gen. Jackson, to stimulate them to insurrection, and produce al! the horrors of a servile war. This agitation has ever since been continued by the public press, by the proceedings ol State and County Conventions, and by aboli tion sermons and lectures. The time of Con gress Las been occupied in violent speeches on ihe never-ending subject, and appeals in pam phlet. and other forms, endorsed by distin guished names, hive been scut forth from this c ;“U-re-l point, and spread broadcast over the Union. Hour easy would Itbc forthcAmeri ran people to settle: the slavery question for ever, and to restore peace and harmony to tbit distracted country. They alone can do 1L All tliat is necessary to accomplish this object, and nil which the slave States have ever contended tor, i< to be let alone, and permitted to man age their domestic institutions in their own ■way, us sovereign States. They, and thev alone, arc responsible before God and the world for the shivery existing among them, r or this the po<v»c of the North arc not more responsible, and have no more right to Inter fere, thnn wfyh similar institutions in Russia or Brazil, Upon their good sense and patriot ic forocaranee I confess I greatly rely. With out their aid it is beyond the power of any l resident, no matter what maybe his own po- LMcal proclivities, to restore pcaccandharmo "ny among thoiSlalcs. Wisely limited and re* etr&ined as is his power under our Constitu tion and law«, he alone can accomplish but little for good or evil, os such a momentous question; aud this brings me to observe that the election of any one of our fellow-citizens to the office of President, docs not in itself af lord just cause for dissolving the Union. This is more especially true if his election has been effected by a mere plurality, aud not a majority of the people, and has resulted from transient aud temporary causes which may probably never again occur. In order Jo justi fy’ - a resort to revolutionary resistance the Fed eral Government must be guilty of a deliber ate, palpable, aud dangerous exercise o f pow ers not gram ed bv the Constitution. The late 1 residential election, however, Iras been held in strict conformity with its express provis lons. How then con the result justify a revo- Intion to destroy this very Constitution? Uea>on, justice and regard forthcConstitu t ion a.l require that wc shall wait for some overt >.id dangerous act on the part of the clo .‘* before resorting to such a rem ■V.ls ,d » however, that the antecedents ?•*,? t -[dent elect have been sufficient to justify the tears of the South that he will at tempi io invade their Constitutional rights i?.!i;‘l‘l»rehcnsions of contingent d inger in the future sufficient to justify the .mmediate destruction of the noblest system ~ o' .?.r ’ l C. l rat ever devised by mortals?

And It may also be observed, judging from present indication!, that bo probability exists of the passage of imon an act by a majority of both Houses either in the present or tile next Congress. Surely under these circumstances wc ought to be restrained from present action by the pre cept ot Him who spake ns never man spoke, that, “sufficient unto the day is the evil there of.” Tlie day of evil may never come unless wc shall rasdily bring it upon ourselves. It is alleged as one cause for immediate Kocessiou that the Southern Stales are denied equal right* with the other States in the common territories. But by what authority are these denied? Not bv Congress, which has never passed, and I be lieve never will px«s, any act to exclude slave tv from these territories; and certainly not bv the Supreme Court which has solemnly de cided that slaves arc property, and, like oil other properly, the owners have a right to lake them into the common territories and hold them there under the protection of the Constitution. So far then as Congress is con cerned, the objection Is not to anything they have alrenuy done, but to what thev may do hereafter, it will surely be admitted that this M’preiieuston of future danger is no good rea * m for an immediate dissolution of the Union. It is true that the Territorial Legislature of Kansas, on the l£*d of February, lt*X), passed In great haste an act over the veto of the Governor, declaring that slavery is, and shall be forever prohibited in the territory. Such au act, however, plainly violating the rights of property secured by the Constitution, will surely bn declared void by the Judiciary whenever it shall be presented in a lega’ form. Only three days after my inauguration, the Supreme Court of the United States solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a Territorial Legislature. Yet such has been the factious temper of the times, that the cor rectness of tills decision has been extensively impugned before the people, and the question has given rise to angry political conflict throughout the country. Those who have appealed from this judgment of our highest Constitutional tribunal to popular assemblies, would, if they could, invest Territorial Legis latures with power to annul the sacred rights of property. This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal Con stitution to exercise. Evciy State legislature in the Union is forbidden by its own Consti tution to exercise iL It cannot be exercised in any State, except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity, when framing or amending their Stata Constitution. In Tike manner, it con onl/be exercised by the peo ple of the Territory represented in'a conven tion of delegates for the purpose of framing a constitution, prefatory to admission as a State into the Union. Then, and not until then, are they invested with power to decide the ques tion whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits. This U an act of sovereign authority, and not of subordinate territorial legislation. Were it otherwise, then indeed wontd the equality of the States in the Terri tories be destroyed, and the rights of proper ty in slaves would depend, not upon the guar antees of the Constitution, hut upon the shift ing majorities of an Irresponsible territorial legislature. Such a doctrlnc,from Its intrinsic 'uusouudncss, cannot long influence any por tion of our people, much less can it afford a fjod reason for a dissolution of the Union, be most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been committed consist in the acts of different State Legislatures to defeat the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. It ought to be remembered, however, that for these acts neither Congress nor any President can be justly held responsible; hav ing been passed in violation of the Federal Constitution, they arc therefore null and void. All the Courts, both State and Nation al, before whom the question has arisen, have from the beginning declared the Fugitive Slave Law to he constitutional. The single exception Is that of a State Court in Wiscon sin, and this has not only been reversed by the proticr appellate tribunal, but has met with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent. The va lidity of lids law' has been established over and over again by the Supremo Court of tbc Uni ted States with i»crf»*ct unanimity. It is founded upon an express provision of the Con stitution, requiring that fugitive slave* who escape from service in one State to another, shall be delivered up to their masters. With out this provision, it is a well-known histori cal fact that tbc Constitution itself could never have been adopted by the Convention. In one form or another under the acts of 1793 or 1850, both beingsobstantlally the same, the Fugitive Slave Law has been the law of the land from fh* qavb of Washington tor the present mo- Here, then, a clear case Is presented in Shb* it will be the duty of the next President, «Vifc tu been my own, to act with vigor in ex ssSaaaswsssvs thlu-T.oo.

The States-, standing on the busts of the mand tins ftet of Justice from the Stales of the North. Should it be refused them, the Coustl aiMoh, to which al! the States arc parties, will nave been wilfully violated by one portion of them, In a provision essential’to the domestic. security and happiness of lhc rCinaindcr. In that event the injured Elates, oiler having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtiin redress, would bejustiflcdln revolution *.rV resistance to the government of the Union. I have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance, because it has been claimed witliiu the last few years, that any State, whenever it shall be her sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from the Union in accordance with the Constitution, and without any violation of thu constitutional rights of the other members of the confederacy; that as each became parlies to the Union by the vote of Us own people assembled in conven tion, bO any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar manner, by the vote of such a convention. In order to Justify seces sion as a constitutional remedy, it most be on the principle that the Federal Government is u mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by one of the contracting parties. If this be so, tbe confederacy is a rope of sand, and to be separated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion iu any of the States. In this manner our thirty three States may resolve themselves into as many petty. Jarring and hostile republics, each one retiring from the Union without, respon sibility, whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course; by this process u Union might be entirely broken into fragments in a few weeks, which cost our fore fathers many years of tolJj privation and blood to establish. ’ Such a principle Is wholly in consistent with the history. As it whs framed with the greatest deliberation and care, it was submitted to convections of the people of the several Staten for ratification. Its provisions were discussed at length in these bodies cum jHiscd of the first men of the country. Its op ponents contended that ft Conferred power upon the Federal Government dangerous to the rights of t lie States, whilst Its advocates main h»:nod that under a fair construction of the in slruuicnt, there was no foundation prehcnsioDs. In that eighty struggle between t tie first Intellects of this or any other coun try* it nevt'r occurred to any individual, either among its opponents or advocates, to assertor even to intimate that tbdrcfibrts were all vain labor, because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved, she might secede from the Union. What a crushingargmuent would this have proved against those who'dreaded that the rights of the Slates would be endangered by the Constitution ? The truth is, tbatitwas not until many years after the origin of tlie Federal Government, that such a proposition was first advanced. It was then met and refu ted by tbc conclusive arguments of General Jackson, who, in his message of the Ifith of January, ISkJ, transmitting the nullifying or dinance of South Carolina to Congress, em ploys the following language; ** The right of tbc people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, without the con font of the other Slates, from their most sol emn obligations, hazard* the liberty and hap piness of millions composing this Union, and cannot bo acknowledged. Such authority' is believed to be utterly repugnant, both to the principles upon which the General Govern ment is constituted, and to the objects which it was expressly formed to attain. It is not pretended that any clause in tbc Constitution gives couutcnancc’lo such a theory; it is alto gether founded upon inference, not from anv language contained iu the instrument itself, but from tbc sovereign character of the sever al Slates by which it was ratified; but is be yond the power of a Stale, like an individual, to yield a portion of iu sovereign rights Inse cure the remainder.” In the language of Mr. Madi-on, who has been called the Father of the Constitution, it was formed by the States,- that is by t he people in each of the States, act ing in their highest sovereign capacity, and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the State constitutions; nor i*s the government of the United States, created by the Constitution, less a government, In the strictest sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers, than the governments created by the Constitutions of the States are within their several organized into Legislative, Executive andJu dietary departments. It operates like them directly on persons and things, and like them, it has at command a physical force for execu ting the powers committed to it; was intend ed to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the plwvvu'rc of any one of the contracting par ries of tbc Confederation, u perpetual union between tbc Stales; and by the loth article, it i* expressly declared that the articles of this Confedcra ion shall be inevitably observed by every State, and the Union shall be per petuated. The Preamble to the Constitution of tltc United States, having expressed reference to the articles of Confederation,whichstatcs it was established in order to form a more perfect Union, docs not include the essential attribute of perpetuity; but that the Union was design ed to be perpetual, appears conclusively from Ibc nature and extent of the powers conferred by the Constitution of the Federal Govern ment. These powers embrace the very high est attributes of national sovereignty. They place both the sword and tbc purse under its control. Congress has power to make war and to make peace, to raise and support ar mies and navies and to conclude treaties with foreign governments. It is invested with tbc power t» coin money and to regulate tire value thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the seve ral States. It is not necessary to enu merate the other high powers which have been conferred upon the Federal Govern ment. In order to cany the enumerated pow ers Into effect. Congress possesses tbc exclu sive rlgUi iu Uy miii eotlMit Julies Oil IQipOrtS, and in common with the States to lay and col lect all other taxes. But the Constitution has not only conferred these high powers upon Congress, but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the States from interfering with their exercise for that purpose. It lias in a st rong prohibitory language expressly declared that no State slnill enter Into any treaty, alli ance or confederation, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver coin a ten der in payment of debts, pass any bill of at tainder, export jhrfo laws, or laws impairing the obligations of contracts. Moreover, without the consent of Congress, no State shall lay any any imposts or duties, or any imports or ex ports, except what may be absolutely necessa ry for oscentingits inspection laws; and If they exceed this amount, the excesses shall belong to the United States, and no State shall with out tbc consent of Congress lay any duty on lonuagc, keep troops or ships o’f war In time «*f peace, enter into any agreement or com pact. with another State or with a foreign pow er, or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of further delay. In order still farther to secure the uninter rupted exercise of these high powers against State interposition, it Is provided that tbc Court and the laws of the United States, which shall be mode in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which Khali be made jndcr the authority of the Unit cd States, shall lie the supreme law of the land, and the Judges In every State shall he bound thercbv, anj thing iu the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. The solemn sanc tion of religion has been superadded to the olh ligations of official duty, and all Senators and Representatives of Uu* United States, all mem bers of State Legislatures and all Executive and Judicial officers, both of tbc United States and the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. In order to carry into effect these laws, the Constitution has established a perfect govern ment in all its forms. Legislative, Executive and Judicial, and the Government to the ex tent of its powers, acta m|Hm the individual citizens of every State a.nd executes its own decrees by the agency of its own officers. lu this respect it differs cnlirclyfrom tbc Gov ernment under the old Confederation, which was confined to making requisitions on the States in their sovereign character. This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or refuse, and they often declined to comply with such requisitions. It thus became necessary, for the purpose ofremoringthebarrier, and In order to form a more perfect union, to estab lish a Government which could act dlrectlv up on the jicople, and execute its own laws with out the intermediate agency of the States. This has been accomplished by the Constitu tion of the United States. In short, the Government created by the Constitution, and drawing its authority from the sovereign people of each of the sovereign States, lias precisely the same right to excr rise its power over the people of all States in the enumerated eases, that, each one of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the United States, but reserved to the States re spectively. or to the people. To the extant of the delegated i*owcn», the Constitution of the Uuited States is as mnch a part of the Consti tution of each State, and fa as binding upon the people ns though it had been tcxtuallv in nerted therein. This Government, therefore. Is a great and powerful government, invested with all the attributes of sovereignty of the special subjects to which Its authority ex tends. Its framers never intended to implant in Its bosom tbc seeds of its own destruction, nor were they, at its creation, guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution. It was'not intended by Us framers to be the baseless fabric of a vision, which, at the touch of the enchanter, would vanish Into thin air, but a substantial and mighty fabric, capable of resisting the slow decay of time, and of de fying the storms of ages. Indeed, well may jealous patriots of that day have indulged fears that a government of such high powers might violate the reserved rights of the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction of those powers, to prevent the danger; hot they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imagine, that the Constitution would be so interpreted as to enable any State, by her own act and without tbc consent of her sister States, to discharge her peopla from all or any of their federal obligations* It may be asked, then, are the people of the States without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the Federal Government ? By no means. Tbc right of resistance on the part ofthe governed against the oppression of their governments cannot be denied; it exists independent of all constitutions, and has been exercised at all periods of the world’s history. Under it old governments have been destroyed, and under it new ones have been replaced. It is embodied in strong and express language, in our own Declaration of Independence, but the distinction must ever be observed, thn this is revolution against the established gov ernment, and not a volantary secession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In short, let ns look the danger fairly in the lace: Secession is nothing more nor less than revelation. It may or it may not be justifia ble revolution, but still it is revolution. What, in the meantime, Is the responsibility and true position of the executive, bound by solemn oath before God and tbo country to take care that the laws be faithfully executed? From this obligation he cannot be absolved by asy human power. But whet if the performance of this duty, in whole or iu part, has been ren dered Impracticable by events over which be could have exercised Jno control ? Such at the State ooutb Carolina, oo far as tuc laws of toe United Stiles to secure tbc administration of Justice by means of the Federal Judiciary Is concerned, nil the Federal officers within its limits, through whotcagency alone those laws can be carried into execution, have already resigned. TVe have no longer a District Judge, or District Attorney, in South Caroli na. In fact, the whole machinciy of the Fed eral Government, necessary for the distribu tion of remedial Justice among thepcopie,hos been demolished, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace It. The only acta of Congress on the statute book bearing upon this subject, are those of the 28th February, 17115, and Jd March, 1807. These authorize the President, after he shall have ascertained that the Marshal with his posse comitalus is unable to execute tivil or criminal process in nuy particular case, to call forth the militia, and employ the army and navy to aid him In performing the service; having .first, by pro clamation, commanded the insurgents to dis perse uud return peaceably to tbeir respective abodes within a limited lime. This duty can not, by any possibility, be performed In a State where no judicial authority exists to issue process, ana where there Is no Marshal to exe cute, and where, even If there were such an office, the entire population would combine iu one solid tolrimfa io resist him. The mere resistance of these provisions proves how inadequate they are, without further legis lation, to overcome’a united opp Ition in ft single State, not to speak of other States who may place themselves In a similar attitude. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws cannot bo amended so as to cany out more effectually the objects of the Constitution. The same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the laws for Ibc collection of the customs. The revenue still continues to be collected as heretofore at the Custom House lu Charleston, and should tbc Collector unfortunately resign, a successor may be appointed to perform this duty. Then, in regard to the property of the United States in South Carolina, this has been purchased for a fair equivalent, by the consent of the Legis lature of the State, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dee., and over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation bos been expressly granted by the Court to Con gress. It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the United States from this property by force; but if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in the command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on tbc defensive. In such a contingency, the responsibility for consequences would right fully rest upon the heads of the assailants. Apart from the execution of tbc laws, so far as this may be practicable, the Executive has no authority to decide what shall be the rela tions between the Federal Government and South Carolina. He has been invested with no buck discretion. He jiosscsscs no power to change the relations heretofore ex isting between them, much less to acknowl edge the independence of that State. This would be to invest a mere Executive officer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the Confederacy among our thirty-three sovereign States. It has no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign de-facto govern ment involving no such responsibility; any at tempt to do this would on bis part be a naked act of usurpation. It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its bearings. Tbc course of events is so rapidly hastened forward that the emergency may arrive when you may be called upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the power, by fyreo of arms, to compel a Stale to remain' in the Union. I should feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to express my opinion on tbc im portant subject. Tiic question fairly stated is: Has the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to force a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw, or has actu ally withdrawn from the Confederacy? If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a State. After much serious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other depart ment of the Federal Government. It is mani fest, upon an inspection of the Constitution, that this is not among the specitieaud enumer ated powers granted to Congress, and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not neces sary and proper for carrying into execution any one of these powers. So fir from this power having been delegated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the Convention which framed the Constitution. It appears from the proceedings of that body, on the filst of May, 1757, that the clause authorizing an execution of the force of the whole against a delinquent State came up for consideration. Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief, but powerful speech, from which I shall extract but a single sentence. He observed : “ The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an inllic •tion of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolu tion of all ’previous compacts by which it might be bound.” Upon his motion the clause was unanimous ly postponed, and was never, I believe, again presented. Soon after, on the Blh of June, 1757, when incidentally adverting to this subject, be said: “Any Government for the United States, formed on the supposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the Slates, would prove as visionary aud fallacious as the Government of Congress,” evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confederation. Without descending to ]>artieulars, it may be safely asserted that the power to make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the Constitution. Suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a State, how arc wc to govern it afterwards ? Shall wc hold It as a province and govern It by a despotic power? In the nature of things we could not by pbys leal force control the will of the people, and compel them to elect Senators and Represen tatives to Coiurrc-sc. |M-ifuiin all tbc inner dunes depending upon their own rela tion, and required from the free citizens of a free State as a constitutional member of the Confederacy. But if wc possessed the power, would it lie wise to exercise it under the existing circumstances ? The object would be doubtless to preserve the Union, but would not only prevent the most effectual means of destroying it, but would banishall hope of its peacca’blu'rcconstraction. Besides, in the fra ternal conflict a va<t amount of blood and treasure would be expended, rendering future reconciliation between the States impossible, lu tbc meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings aud privations of tbc people during its existence. The fact is that oirr Un ion rests upon public, and can never be ce mented, by the blood of its citizens shed In civil war. ’ If it cannot live in the affections of the people. It must one day perish. Congress jtossesscs many means of preserving by con ciliation; but the sword was not placed In their hands to preserve it by force. But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countir incn to pause, and deliberate before they de termine to destroy this, the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human free dom. Since the world began it has been con focratcd by the blood of our Fathers, by the glories of onr pa>t, and by the hopes of the fu ture; and the Union has already made us the most prosperous, and ere long will, if pre ferred, render ns the most powerful nation on tbc face of the earth. In every foreign region of the globe the title of American citizen is held in the highest rc bpeet, and when pronounced in foreign lands it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest pride. Surely, when we roach tbc brink of the yawning abyss, we shall recoil with horror from the hist fatal plunge. By such a dread catastrophe the hopes of tbc friends offreedom throughout the world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden des potism would enshroud the nation. Our ex ample for more than eighty years would not only be lost, but it would be quoted as a con clusive proof that maw is unfit for self-govern ment. It is not every wrong, nay, it is not every grievous wrong, which can justify a re sort to such a tearful alternative. This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted. We should reflect that under this free government there is an incessant ebb and flow of public opinion. Tbc shivery question, like everything human, will have its day. I firmly believe that it has already reached and passed the culminating point f but if. in the midst of the existing ex citement, the Union shall perish, the cvU'may then become irreparable. Congress can con tribute much to arrest it. by proposing and re commending to tbc Legislatures of the seve ral States the remedy for existing evils which the Constitution hasltsclf provided for its own preservation. This has been tried at different critical periods of our history, and always with eminent success. It is to be found in the olh article, providing for its own amendment. Under this article amendments have been pro posed by two-thirds of both Houses of Con gress, aud have been ratified by tbc Legisla tures of three-fourths of the several States,and have consequently become parts ofthe Constl tion. To this process the country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Congress frompas r-ing any law respecting'an establishment of religion, or abridging tlic freedom of speech oi of the press, or the right of petition. To this we arc also Indebted for the bill of rights which secured the people against any abuse of power by the Federal (iovemmciil. Such were the apprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State rights at that pcriod.’as to have rendered It extremely doubtful whether tbc Constitution conld have long survived these amendments. Again the Constitution was amended by the same process after the election of President Jefferson by the House of Representatives, in February, 1803. This amendment was ren dered necessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers which had seriously threatened the existence of the Government during the pen dancy of that election. The article for its own amendment was intended to proenre tbc amicable adjustment ofthe confiietiog Con stitutional questions, like tbc present, which might arise between tbc Governments of the States and of the United States. This appears from contemporaneous history. In this con nection, I shall merely call attention to a few instances in Mr. Madison's justly celebrated report, in 1779. to the Legislature of Virginia. In this, he ably and conclusively defended the resolutions of the preceding Legislature against the strictures of several other Slate Legisla tures. These were mainly lounded upon the protest of the Virginia ’Legislature against the alien and sedition acts as palpable, and alarming infractions on the Constitution. In pointing out the peaceful and constitu tional remedies—and he referred to none other —to which the States were authorized to resort on such occasions, be concludes by say ing that the Legislatures of the States might have made a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts, or they might have represented to their respective Senators in Congress their wish that two-thirds thereof wonl'd propose any explanatory amendment to the Constitu tion; or two-thirds of themselves, if such bad been their option, might by an application to Congress have obtained a convention for the very same object. This la the very course which 1 earnestly recommend. In order to obtain an explanatory amendment of the Constitution on the subject of slavery. This might origin ate with Cohgrcst or the State Legislatures, as may be deemed mofit., advisable to' attain the object., The cxplanr.toiy amend ment might be conllned to the final settlement of the construction of the Constitution on three special points First, an express recognition of flic right of property in slaves in the States where it now exists, or may hereafter ovist. Second, the duty of protecting this ritrlit in all the com mon territories throughout their territorial existence, and until they shall be admitted as States into the. Union, with or without slave ry, os their Constitution may prescribe. Third, a like recognition of the right of the master to his slave, who has escaped from one State to another, to be restored and delivered up to him; and the validity of the Fugitive Slave Law, enacted for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State laws impairing or decreasing tills right arc violations of the Con stitution, and consequently null and void. It may be objected,that this construction of the Constitution has already been settled by the Supreme Court of the United States, and what more ought to be required y Theanswer is that uvery large proportion of the people of the United States still controvert the correctness of this decision, and never will cease from agi tation and admit Its binding force until clearly established by the people of the several States in their sovereign character. Such an expla nation would, it is believed* forever terminate the existing dissensions, and restore peace and harmony among the States. It ought not to be doubted tbat such an appeal to the arbi trament established by the Constitution itself, would be received with favor by all the States of the Confederacy. In any event it ought lo be tried in a spirit of conciliation before any of these States shall separate themselves from the Union. When I entered npon the duties of the Presi dential ofilce, neither our foreign nor domestic affair* were at all satisfactory. Wc were involved In dangerous complications with several nations, and two of ourterritorie» were In a state of revolution against our Gov ernment a restorationt of the African slave trade bad numerous and powerful advocates; unlawful military expeditions were counte nanced by many of our citizens, and were suf fered, In defiance of the clforts of our Govern ment, to escape from our shores for the pur pose of making warupontbe unoffending peo ple of the neighboring Republics, with whom we were at peace. lu addition to these and other difficulties, we experienced a revulsion in monetary af fairs, soon after my advent, proving of unex ampled severity aud ruinous consequences to the country. When we take a retrospect of what was then our condition, and contrastthis with its material prosperity at the time of the late Presidential election, wc have abundant reason to return our grateful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never forsaken us, os a nation, in all our trials.

RELATIONS—CHEAT BRITAIN. Our relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character. Since the commence ment of my administration, the two danger ous questions arising from the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, and from the right of search claimed by the British Government, have been amicably and honorably adjusted. The dis cordant’eonstruetions of the Clayton and Bill wer' treaty between the two Governments, which, at different periods of the discussion, bore a threatening aspect, have resulted in a linal settlement, entirely satisfactory to this Government. In my last annual message, I informed Congress that the British Govern ment had not then completed arrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicara gua in pursuance of the understanding be tween the two Governments. It was never theless confidently expected that the good work would ere long be accomplished. This confidence has since been fulfilled. Her Brit tanic Majesty concluded a treaty with Hondu ras on the 28lh of November, 185*J, and with Nicaragua on the 2Sth of August. 1800, re linquishing the Mosquito Protectorate. Be sides, by the former the Bay Islands arc re cognized as a part of the Republic of Hon duras. It may be observed that the stipulations of these treaties conform In every im|K>rtaut par tlcular to the amendments adopted at London, on the 17th October. 1830, between the two governments. It will be recollected that this treaty was rejected by the British Government because of its objection to the just and impor tant amendment of the Senate to the article relating to Ruatan and the other islands iu the Bay of Honduras. It is a source of sincere satisfaction to all classes'of our fellow-citizens, and especially to those’ engaged in foreign commerce, that the chum on the jiart of Great Britain forcibly to visit and search Ameriean merchant vessels ou the high seas, in time of peace, has been abandoned. This was, by far, the most dangerous question to the peace of the two countries, which has existed since the war ol 1812. 3Vbil>t it remained open, they might at any moment have been precip itated into a war. This was rendered mani fest by the exasperated stale of public feeling’ throughout our entire country, produced by the forcible search of Ameriean merchant vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Cuba, in tlie spring of 1858. Tlie American people hailed with general acclaim the orders of the Secretary of the Navy to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of any other nation. These orders mi"ht have produced an unfortunate collision ne tween the naval forces of the two countries. This was most fortunately prevented by an appeal to the justice of Great Britain, and to the law of nations, as expounded by her own most eminent jurists. The only question of any importance which still remains open is the disputed title between the two govern ments to the Island of San Juan, in tlie vicin ity of Washington Territory. As this ques tion is still under negotiation, it is not deemed advisable at the present moment to make any other allusion to the subject. The recent visit of tlie Prince of Wales in appropriate character, to the pc >ple of this country, has proved to be a most auspicious event in its consequences. It cannot fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings of both countries in their political and social In tercourse wiiu cacti otner. 

FRANCE. "With France, our ancient and powerful ally, our relations continue to be of (he most friendly character. A decision lias recently been made by a French Judicial Tribunal, with the approbation of the Imperial Government, which cannot fail to foster the sentiments of mutual regard thathas so long existed between the two countries. Under the French law, no person can sen e in the armies of France unless he be a French citizen. The law of France recognizing the natural right of expatriation, it follows as a necessary consequence, that a Frenchman, by the fact of having become a citizen of the United States, has changed his allegiance and has lost his na tive character. He cannot, therefore, be com pelled to serve in the French armies, in ease he should return to his native count ry. These principles were announced in 1852 by the French Minister of War, and in two late cases have been confirmed by the French Judiciary. In these, two natives of France have been dis charged from the Frcncharmy.beee.use they had become American citizens. To ctmdoy thelan gnago of our present Minister to France, who has rendered good sendee on this occasion, a I do not think our French naturalized fellow citizens will hereafter experience much annoy ance on this subject, I venture to predict that the lime is not far distant when the other con tinental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy which has done so ninth honor to the enlightened government of the Emperor.*’. In any event, our government is bound to pro tect the rights of her naturalized citizens eve rywhere, to the same extent as* though they had drawn their first breath in this country. We can recognize no distinction between oar native and naturalized citizens. 

RUSSIA. Between the great Empire of Russia and the United States, the mutual friendship and re gard which has so long existed, still continues to prevail, and. if possible, to increase. In deed, our relations with that Empire arc all that we could desire. SPAIN. ITOur relations with Spain arc now of a more complicated, though le-« dangerous character, than they have been for many years. Our cllizcnsibavc long held, and continue to hold, numerous claims against the Spanish govern ment. These have' been ably urged for a se ries of years by our successive diplomatic representatives at Madrid, but without ol>- taining redress. Tbc Spanish Government finally agreed to institute a joint commission for the ’ adjustment of these claims, and on the fifth day of March. 1880, concluded a convention for that purpose with our present Minister at Madrid. Under this Convention,**ahat have been denominated the Cuban claims, amounting to In which more than one hundred of our fellow citizens arc interested, were recognized, and the Spanish Government agreed to pay one hundred thousand dollars "of this amount within three months following the “xchange of ratifications- The payment of the remain ing $28,035 54 was to await the decision of the commissioners for oi against the Amistad claim, but in any event, the balance wa< to be mid to the claimants, either by Spain or the United States. Those terms, *1 have every reason to know, are highly satisfactory to the holders ol the Cuban claims. Indeed, they have made a formal offer, authorizing the State Department to settle their claims, and to deduct the amount of the Amistad claims from the sums which they are entitled to re ceive from Spain. This offer, ofconrse.aunnot be accepted. All other claims of cit izens of the United States against Spain, or of subjects of the Queen of Spain against the United States, including the Amisted claim, were by this Conven tioc referred to a Board of Comraisioners in the usual form. Neither the validity of the Amisted claim, nor any other claim against either party, with the single exception of the Cuban claims, was recognized by the Conven tion. Indeed, the Spanish Government did not insist that tbc validity of the Amisted claim should bethusrecognized, notwithstanding Its payment had been recommended to Congress by two of my predecessors, as well as by my self, and an appropriation forthat purpose bad passed the Senate ofthe United States. They were content that it should be submitted to tbc Board for examination aud decision like the other claims. Both Governments were bound respectively to pay the amounts awarded to the several claimants, at such times i and places os may be fixed by and according to tbc tenor of said awards, and transmitted by this Convention to the Senate for theircon stitutlonal action. On the 3d of May, 1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June, they de termined that they would not advise and con sent to its ratification. These proceedings place oar relations with Spain in an awkward and embarrassing position. It is more than probable that a final adjustment of these claims will devolve upon my successor. I re iterate the recommendation contained in my annual message of December repeated in that of December, 1859,1n favor ofthe acqui sition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly believe that such an acquisition would contribute essentially to the wqll-being and prosperity of both countries, in allfliturc time, as well as prove the certain means of im mediately abolishing the African slave trade, throughout the world. I would not repeat this recommendation upon the present occa sion, if I believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United States, upon conditions highly fa vorable to Spain, could justly tarnish the na tional honor of the proud and ancient Spanish monarchy. Surely no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a disregard of the na tional honor 01 France, lur transferring Loui siana Id the United States fora fair equivalent, both in money and eommcreoil advantages. 

AUSTRIA, AC. With the Empire of Austria and the remain ing continental powers of Europe, including that ol thcSultau, our relations continue to be ot the most tricmllj character. cunt a. The friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Government of the United States towards the Empire of China, has produced the most satisfactory results. The treaty of Tien-tsin, of the 18th of June, ISSS, lias been faithfully observed by the Chinese authorities. The Con vention of the Bth of November, 1853, supple mentary to this treaty for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our citizens in China, referred to -in my last annual message, has already been carried into effect, so far os this was practical Under this convention, the sum of 500,000 taels, equal to about $700,009, was stipulated to be paid in satisfaction of the claims of American citizens out of the one-fiftieth of the receipts for tonnage. Import and export duties on American vessels, at the ports of Canton, Shanghai and Fucbou; and it was agreed that this amount shall be In full liquidation of all dalm* of American citizens ut the various ports to this date. Debentures for this amount, to wit: £OO.OOO taels for Canton, 109,000 for Shanghai, and 100,000 for Fucbou, were delivered according to tbe terms of the convention, by the respective Chinese collect ors of tbe customs of those ports, to the agent selected by our Minister to receive the same. Since that time the claims of onr citizens have been adjusted by the Board of Commissioners appointed for that purpose, under the act of March Sd, 1850; and tnelrawards, which proved satisfactory to the claimants, have been ap proved by our Minister: In the aggregate, they amount to the sum of $408,001.78. The claim ants have already received a large proportion of the sums awarded to them, out of the fund provided, and it is confidently expected that the remainder will, ere long, be entirely paid. After theaward?shall have beensatisfied, there will remain a surplus of more than £200.000 at the disposition of Congress. As this will in equity belong to the Chinese Government, would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent object, in which the Chinese may be specially interested ? Onr Minister to China, in obedience to his instructions, has remained perfectly neutral lu the war between Great Britain and Fiance and the Chinese Empire, although in conjunction with the Russian Minister, he was ever ready and willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ his good offices in restoring peace be tween the parties. It is but an act of simple justice, both to our present Minister and his predecessor, to state, they have both proved fully equal to the delicate, trying and respon sible positions in which they have on diflerent occasions Jticcn placed. 

JAPAN, Tho ralifirartms of the (rcatv with Japan, condnclcil at Voids on the 20th of Jnlv, ISM. were exchanged at Washington on the 2JJ of May last, anu the treaty itself was proclaimed on the succeding clav. There is good reason to expect that under its protection and Influ ence, our trade and intercourse with that dis tant and interesting people, will rapidlv in crease. The ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with unusual solemnity. For this purpose the Tycoon had accredited three of his most distinguished Ministers IMenipoten tnry, who were received and treated with marked distinction and kindness, both bv the Government and people ofthcU.S. There is every reason to believe that they have re lumed to their native land, entirely satisfied with their visit, and inspired by’ the most friendly feelings for our country. Let us ar dently hope, in the language of the treaty it self, tliat there shall heuceVorward be perpet ual pence and friendship between the United States of America and his Majesty the Tycoon of Japan and his successors. BRAZIL. 33 hh the wise, conservative and liberal gov ernment of the Empire of Brazil, our relations continue to be of the most amicable character. NEW GRENADA. Tlie exchange of the ratifications of the Con vontioinvl; h the Kcpiibl ic of N',-iv G renailn. Washington on the 10th September. 18o<, Las been long delayed from accidental cause , for which neither part vis censurable. These ratifications wen* duly exchanged in this city on the ftth of November last. Thu has a controversy been amicably terminated, which had become so serious at ’the period of my inauguration as to require me. on the 17th April, 1857.10 direct our Minister to demand lus passports and return to the United State® Under this condition, the Government oi‘ New Grenada h;w specially acknowledged it self to be responsible to our citizens for dam ages which were caused by the riot at Panama ou the 15t!i April, 185(1. These claims, to gether with other claims of our citizens which had been long urged in vain, arc referred for adjustment to a board of Commissioner*. I submit a copy of the Convention to Congress, and recommend the legislation necessary to carry it into effect. COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA. Persevering effort# have been made for the adjustment of the claim# of American citizens against the Government of Costa Rk-a, and I am happy to inform you that these have finally prevailed; a Convention wns si'med at the city of San Jose, on the 2d of July last, between the Minister rcri lent of the United States in Costa Rica, and the Plenipotentiaries **} that Republic, referring those claims to a board or Commissioners, and providin''- for irayment of their awards. This Convention will be submitted to the Senate for their Constitu tional action. The claims of our citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua, have not vet been provided for by treaty, although diligent ef forts for this purpose have been marie bv onr minister resident in that Republic. These are still continued with a fair prospect of success. 

MEXICO. Our relations with Mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory •'awcUilucu iu mv iwo last annual messages I dlscusscd'exiehsively the subject of these relations, and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts and argu ments then presented. Thev proved con clusively that our citizens residing in Mexico, and our merchants trading thereto, had suf fered a series of wrontpi and omrase* such a* \vc have ever patiently home from anv na tion. For these, our successive ministers. In voking the faith of treaties, had. in the name of their country, pcndstentlv demanded redress and indentitication. but without the ."lightest etfect. Indeed, so contident had the Mexican authorities been, because of our pa tient endurance, that thev universally be lieved they might commit their outrages upon American citizens with absolute Impu nity. Thus wrote our Minister in lssC r , and expressed the opinion that nol hlng but a man ifestation of the powers of the Government and of its jmrposc to punish these wrongs would avail. Afterwards, iu 1857, came the adoption ot a new Constitution for Mexeo, the union of a President and a Congress under its provisions, and the inauguration ofu Presi dent within one short mouth, However, the President was expelled from the capital bv a rebellion In the army, and the supremo power of the Republic was assigned to Gen. Zuloagn. This usurper was in his'turn soon compelf-d to retire from the place by General Miramon. Under the Constitution which had thus been adopted, Gen, Juarez, as Cluef Jn-tice of the Supreme Court, became the lawful President of the Republic, an lit was forthc maintenance of the Constitution, and his authority derived from it. that the civil war commenced and still continues to be proseented. Throughout the year 185S the Constitutional i*artv grew ftromrer and stronger. In the previous histo ry of Mexico a successful military revolution at the capital had most universally been the : -nal for submission throughout the Repub lic. Not to on the present: a majority of the citizens persistently sustained the constitu tional government. When this was recom mended In April, 1859, by the Government of the United States, its authority extended over a largo majority of the Mexican Slates and •»coplc. including Vera Cruz, and all the im portant seaports'of the Republic. From that period our commerce with Mexico began to revive, and the constitutional government lias atfordedit all the protection in their power. Meanwhile the government of Miramon s’lll held sway at the Capital, and over the sur rounding country, and continued its outrages against the few American citizens who .-till had the courage to remain within us power. To cap the climax, after the battle of Tacnlwva. In April. IfvjO. Gen. Marques ordered three citizen* of the United State*, two nf them physician*, to be seized In the hospital at that place, and *bot with out trial. TLi* was done, notwithstanding our uiiforiiinate c.nr.trvmen were at the moment en gaged in the holy cat:?e of offering relief to the sol dier* of both parses wbtfhad Is en wounded In the »«attle. without making-liny distinction between them. The time had arrived in my opinlon.whcn this Government was bound to exert It* power t*» avenge and retires* the wrongs ofoarclrlzcns.audtoaCbrd them protcetlonln Mexico. The interposing olt* slacle was.that thecnarlry under the sway *if Ml ramon. could not be r*uwLed without pa*-fng over territory under the jurisdiction «»f fonrtltmloual Government, Under these circumstances. Idernu-d It mv duty to recommend to Congress In my U*t annual me«sage.the employment ofn snfilclcnt mil imrv force to penetrate into the Interior where the giivernnient ofMlramoa wa* lobe fitund.with. nr If need be. without the consent of the Juarez govern ment. fltongh It wasnotdonbtetl hi* consent con’d be obtained.

The Constituted o"wr nment would then have been rstahlishvl nt the city of Mt-xlco. anl woti*<l have been r*.-a«!y and willing, to the cxtrrt of its at-Htr, to do us Justice. In addition, and I deem this amot Im portant couslderatioa. Foreign Government* would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere In the territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have been relieved from the obli gation of resisting even by force, should this be come necessary, any attempt by tbe«e Governments to deprive oor’ncighboriog Republic of portions of her territory, a duty from wnlch we could not shrink Tdlhunl abandoning the traditional and es tablished policy of the .American people. 1 aai happy to observe that, firmly re'yinz u]>oq il e justice ami good faith of the** Government*, there no present danger that such a contingency will happen. Having discovered that my recommendation* would not be tastaloetl by Congress, the next alternative wa* to accomplish in some degree, if possible, the same ob jects, by treaty stipulations with the con*tbmlon»l government. Such treaties were acc*rrdiegiy conclud ed by our late able and excellent Minister to Mexico, and on the fourth r f January last were sub-aitted to the Senate for ratification. Is they have not received the final action of that body, it would lie improper for me to present a detailed statement of their provisions. Still 1 may be jwnr.itted to express the opinion. In ad vance, that they are calculated to promote the agricul tural, manufacturing and commercial interests of the country, and to secure our ju-l Influence with an ad joining Republic, as to whose fortunes and fate we can never feel indifferent; whilst at the same time they 'provide for the payment of a considerable amount to wards the satisfaction of the claims of our Injured fel low-cltixens. At the period of my Inauguration I was confront ed in Kanfcas by a revolutionary Government, ex isting under what was called the Topeka Consti tntloa, Tne avowed object was to subdue the Ter ritorial Government bv force, and to Inaugurate what was called the Topeka Government in Its stead. Toaccompll&hthls object, an extensive mil itary organization was formed and Its command entrusted to the most violent revolutionary lead en*. Under these circumstances it became my im perative duty to exert the whole Constitutional power of the Executive, to prevent the flames of civil war from raging in Kansas, which tbe ex cited state of the public mind both North and Sooth might have extended into the neighboring State*. The hostile parties lo Kansas fca-I cs*h Inflamed against even other by emissaries both' from the North and booth, to a decree of malignity without parallel In our history. To prevent event ual collision and to resist the civil magistrates In ciifoiclng the laws, a strong detachment of,the army was stationed In the Territory, ready to’ald the Marshals and his deputies when officially called uj>on as a posse comitates lo the execution of civil and criminal processes. Still the troubles In Kan sas could not have been permanently settled without an election by the people, the ballot-boxes In-lug the surest arbitrator of disputes among ‘reemcn. Under this conviction, every proper effort was employ ed to induct; the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates to frame the State Constitution, and after wards at the election to decide whether Kansas should be a alive or free State. The insurgent party refused to vote at either, lest this be considered as a re cognition on thdr part 'of the Territorial government established by Congress. A better spirit, however, seemed soon after to prevail, and the two parties met face to face la the election, held the first Monday of January IbM, for members of the Legislature and State officers, umlerihe Lecompton Constitution. The result was the triumph of the autl-Slavery party at the polls. This decision ot the ballot-box prove*! clearly that tills patty were In the majority, ami removed the danger of civil war. From that time we i*ve heard nothing of the Topeka government, and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles In Kansas was then at an end. The Lecompton Constitution, which had been thus re cognized at tills State election, by the voles of both po litical parties lo Kansas, was transmitted with the re quest that I should present Itto Congress. This Icoold not Imre refused to do, without violating my clearest and strongest convictions of duty. The laws, and all the proceeding which pre ceded aud followed Its formation, were fair, and regular on their face, and what 1 then believed and expressed has proven true; the interests of the people of Kansas would have been best consulted or Its admission, as a State. Into -the Union, espe cially as the majority within a brief period, could have amended the constitution according to their will and pleasure. If fraud existed In any or all uf these proceedings. It was not for the President hut for Congress to Investigate and determine the question of fraud, and what ought to be the consequences. If at the two first elections the majority refused to vote. It cannot be pretended tbat this rcfnsal to exercise the electoral fninclriie could invalidate an election fairly held under law ful authority, even if they had not voted at the third election. It is true that the whole Con stitution had not boon submitted to the pcoile. as I alwavs desired, but the precedents are nu merous of the admission of States Into the Union without such admission. It wonld not comport with my present purpose to review the pro ceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton Con stitution. It Is sufficient to observe that their final ’action his removed the last vestige of serious rev olutionary troubles. The dcqwrate band recently as sembled under a notorious outlaw In the southern |*or tl-»n ol the Territory to resist the execution of the laws ■mrl t-> plunder peaceable citizens, will, I doubt not, be qieedlly brought lo justice. Usd I treated tbe Le comutnn Constitution os a nullity and refused to tanr mil It to Congress, it Is not difficult to imagine, whll-t recalling the position of the country at tliat moment, what would have been the disastrous consequences both In and out of the Territory, from sachdcrilecUon ofduty onlbepartofthe Executive. IVace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah, which, at th» cmn’nenceme'.t of my admlnldra lion, was In a state of open rebellion. This was the more dangerous, as the people, a touted by a Janattcal qdrit, and entnnchel within 'heir mountain fastnesses, might hare made a long and formidable resistance. *'**• ahstit might, it wa-« n«-cef*ary t-» bring them Into -uhjectUu to the Constitution and the laws. Sound ;>olcy, therefore, as well as humanity, required that this object should. If poi-lhl-*, be accomplished without •he effusion of blood. Thl* cold only be eff cled, br •ending a military force Into the Territory, sulficleatly •trong tj convince the je-oj le that resistance would l»e h« pelcss, and at the avne tunc to offer them a pardon far past t.ffenses, nu comlithin of Immediate eubibUsrou *o the Ciorernm-nt. Tld* jodlcy was pursued with mb i ifut eticccs*; and the only cause for regret is tb beavy expenditure requlrct to inarch a large detach ment « f thg army to tbat remote region, and to furnish its sulssbtence. Utah I* now comparatively peaceful nod quiet, and Hie military f.-rce ha.* been withdrawn, except that portion of It necessary to keep the Indians in check, and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to our Pacific possessions.

It I* now quite evident that the financial necc*u *i«:o*uf th** Government will requires modification •»f the Tariff daring your present session, for the purpose of increasing THE REVETSrz. In thU respect t desire to reiterate the women* dation contained in my la-l two anneal mps«*a;:c*. in f.ivur of imposing Instead of ad anlorrm duties on all Imported articl.-s to which these can pr »pt;rlr ho applied. From lonjr ob«-»rvatlon and experk-ccc. I am convinced that -pccidc dnflc* are tmes-sury. both tn protect Ihcrcvctiac. and to secure to onr 'manufactariatf Interests that amount of • !ie:>ln:snl riK-« , oiairrUii''t wh.rh unavoidably rcsul's fr«m a revenue tariff. As an at-ltsct piMpositfon, it pi»t W aJuiittcil that ad r aiorrm duties would, in ih.-ury.he tfceiion ju»t at>d equal, hut if the expert vnce « f this and of all ether commercial nations ha* d-monst-ated that such dalles cannot be asked and collected without errat fraud* cp-m the revmue, then i: Is the psrt wisdom to resort to ■pt-rifk dmir*. la* f.-vtn the Trry nature of an C'l ralomn duty this mn« be the result under it. The inevitable eon«ei|ueore I. that foreign c»ods will be entered at less than their true vain-. The Treasury will therefore lose the duly on the difference beta eea their real and fictitious value, and to this extent we are defrauded. The temptations which ad color mi duties present to a dishonest import er. are irresidible. Ills object Uto pass his poods through the custom house at the very lowest valuation necessary to savethem from conCscvion. In this he too often succeeds, la spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one fur the purchaser, another forth?co*tr>3ihon*e; ard to other expedients lode fraud the Government. The honest Importer produces hi* Invoice to the collector, slating the actual price at which h- purchased the articles abroad. Not so the dl*hone*l importer, and the agent of the foreign man ufacturer. And here it may be observed that a verr Urge proportion of the foreign manufactures imported from abroad, are consigned for sale to cotnrulMion merchant*, vbo are more agents emploved by the mao. uf.ictnrcrers. la such cases, where no "actual sale has been made to fix their value. the foreign manufacturer. If he be dishonest prepares an Invoice of the goods, not at their actual value, out at the very lowest rale neces sary to escape detection. In tot* manner the dishon est Importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a de cided advantage over the honest merchant. They are thus enabled to andmell the fair trader and drive him from the market. In fret, the operation of this system has already driven from the pursuit of honorable com merce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchant*, whose character throughout the world Is the pride of oar country. The remedy lor these evils a to be foand la specific duties. so far as this may be practicable. They dispense with any inquiry at the Custom Bona-* into the actual cost or value of the article, and it cays th«* precl e amount of duty previously fixed bylaw. They pre sent no temptations to the appraisers of foreign poods, who receive bot small salaries, and might by under valuation la a few cases, reader themselves Isdepen dett, Besides, specific duties best conform to the re qulolos la the Constitution, that no preference shell be given byanyrepnlaOcnot commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another. Under our ad valorem system such preferences are. to some extent. Inevitable, and complaints have often been made, that the spirit of thU provision has been re lated by a lower appraisement ol the tame articles at one port than at another. An Impression strangelv enough prevails to some extent, that specific dntl< s are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Great Britain glories In free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the pre sent moment collected tinder a system of specific da ties. It is a striking fact, in this connection, that la tba commercial treaty of .3d Januart, 19M, between FraSitfe and Enplane, one of the articles prbvidca that tbe ad valorem uuilws which ft Imposes than be con verted Into specific duties within ut foonths from in date, and these are lo be ascertained by making an average of the prices for six months previous t> that time. The reverse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue wonld be collected by merely converting Urn ad valo rem duties of a tariff Into general equivalent specific duties. To this extent the revenue would be lucrea-od. and in the same prop -rthm the specific dutv might be diminished, specific dnttev would to the Ameri can manufacturer tfte Incidental prot a-llon to which he U fairly entitled under a revenue tarlif, and to this, sorely no per* »n would object. 1h«? framers of the existing tariff have cone further, and In a liberal i-plrlt have discriminated In favor uf largn and useful branches of oar manafaeturee—not by raising the rate of duties opon the Importation of simitar articles from abroad, hut, what Is the same In ettect, by admitting articles free of duty which enter Into the compodtloa ot their fabrics. Under the present system It ha* been often trtxlv re marked that tbli Incidental protection decreases when the manafectorer amis it most, and Increase.* when lie needs It least, aud constitute.: a sliding scale which al ways operatea acalnst hltn. The revenues ofthecoun try are subject to (dollar fluctuation*. Instead of ap proaching a steady standard as would be the cue un der a system of specific duties. They sink and rise with the slaking and rirlnc prices of the article* In foreign countries. It would not be difficult for Conzres* to arrange a system of specific duties which would afford additional stabllltv botu to oar revenue and oar manufacturer-, and without Injurv or Injustice to aay interest of the country. This might be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article lor a series ofy-ars at the place of exportation, and by simply converting the rate cf ad valorem duly upon It which aright be deemed neces sary for revenue purpose* in ti,*» form of a specific duty. Mich an arrangement coaid nut Injure the con sumer; if he should pay a creaser amount of duty oue year thi* would be counterbalanced thnn-xf, aud lu the aggregate would be the same. 1 desire to call your Immediate attention to the present condition cf tin?

Mr. Green offered a resolution for an inquiry Into the expediency of establishing an armed police force in the border States, slave and tree, for maintaining pcaceand efficient execu tion of the fugitive stive law. The credentials of Senator Baker of Oregon were presented.

The House then reconsidered the vote. The Bill was thus brought up foraction. Mr. Grow did not desire to discuss this measure, the principle involved having been l-efore the country l<*r the post ten years. This bill, however, avoids the prominent objections to President Buchanan's veto message. It dues uot propose to donate lands, but requires payment of $lO for HSO acres. He might, if necessary, quote Jackson against Buchanan to phow that the former was of opinion that the public lands should not be a source of Federal revenue. He moved the previoos question, underihe operation of which the bill passed. lU2 stgainst 7c.
