The Signal-Service manipulator at Wash lon, undismayed by recent unfortunate pre dictions, gives out that the inhabitants of tho Upper Lake region may to-day look for 'clear ing weather, with southwest winds and higher temperature. That is a significant dispatch which soys that the Democrats mean to adjourn the 1 llodso over Monday in order to escape tho expected deluge of bills, resolutions, etc., on that day. They have evidently hoard of Bridgeport Barney ami his bills. Tho Senate yestordoy confirmed tho Presi dent's appointments of Zicuaiuaii Chandler, Secretary of tho Interior; Edwards Fierre pont, Attomoy-Gonoral; John C. New, Treas urer of the United States; and John Qczncy Bantn, Commissioner of Indian Affairs. It is Announced that Mr. Blaine early next week will chum the attention of Congress in a formal speech on tho questions of the cur rency and finance. His views, of course, will bo of the pronounced hard-money typo, and he will pay bis respects to tho financial follies and heresies of tho Democracy. Tho cablo announces tho death at Dot mold, Germany, yesterday, of Paul Fbedehio Emil Leopold, Prince of Lippo-Dotmold. In this Principality, it will be remembered, is located tho colossal statue of HimMANN, re cently erected in commemoration of bis de struction of the Itoxnan legions under Vaeus. Qor, In win, of Californio, in his inaugural Message yesterday, urged that tho State en deavor to bring about such a modification of tho treaty between tho United States and China ns will result in tho restriction of Chi neso immigration. Ho also recommended thal the Legislature demand a general re sumption of specie payments at the earliest possible moment. In the list of Standing Committees an nounced by tho Chairman of tho Board of County Commissioners, tho Ring members are found to have monopolised the important Committees, with tho ( single exception of Equalization of Taxes. The Finance, Public Charities, Public Buildings, Hospitals, and Public Service Committees are hopelessly given over to tho Devil-Fish element. Tho new Board and tho new Committees ore, if possible, worse than their preclaoessora of last year. Tho Hon. John Quincy Smith, of Ohio, tho nowly-oppointed Commissioner of Indian Affaire, and who, it is understood, has accept cd, is spoken of highly by those who know him well os a man of ability and experience In business affairs. Ho was a member of tho Forty-lhinl Congress, was frequently elected a member of tho Legislature of Isis State and of the State Board of Equalization. He has been noted for bis sterling integrity aud for his open opposition to all corrupt nchemos. Those are more fitting qualifications for head of the Indian Bureau than those which vocurod tho place to his predecessor. Some correspondence has pas’ied be tween Attorney-General Piebiieponi? and ex- Benetor llesdkr&oh relatryo to itm alleged attack by the latter upon the P resident in the coarse of bis argument in the Avxbt trial. Mr. FnaitEPONT very properly took exceptions to the hrngusge reported to have been used, and announced that the Do paatment of Justice was not di aposed to pay a lawyer for going out of bis way to moke such an assault u’pon the President. Mr. Henebsoh, who was retained by the Govern* nient to assist District-Atton ley Dnm in the prosecution of tbo St. Louis whisky-fraud eases, flatly denied having used the diare ipootful language ascribed ‘la him by the St. Louis journals, and will ftwward a sworn transcript 0 f wbot be actually did say. If be suocee'jg jn showing that be was misnu ported, *k*t'will probably end tbe matter. Tbs Chicago produce markets were moder ately steady yesterday. Mess pock was act* Ive, and declined 250 perbrl, closing at $19.16 ($19.17} cash and $19.99} for Pebi-uacy. Lord was rather quiet and easier, closing at $13.82} per 100 lbs cash and $12.60 for February. Meats were active and firmer, at 7}c for shoulders, lOjo for abort ribs, and 10}o for short clears, all boxed. Uighwiuca were in fair demand and steady, at sl.ll'per gallon.

It was a wise determination on the port of tbo Court of Inquiry in Gen. Babcock's enso that the proceedings shall be public. It is n matter that has more general interest than army investigations ns n rule, and it is not for the interest of Gen. Babcock nny more than that of tiu> public that tho latter should de pend upon minora and guess-work in regard to the prbcccdlngs from day to day. Tho Court consists of Liout.-Gon. Sreiudan, and Maj.-Qens. Hancock and Terry, and Mnj. Gardner, of tho West Point Academy, who acts ns llocordor. Though the Convention formally convened yesterday, the ease will not bo opened until to-day, when tho prose cutor expects to bo prepared with a list of witnesses. It Booms that Mr. Mcnnr Nelson bos de termined to content the election of Cl&arv and Mullot to (lie County Board, and has filed bills in tho County Court for tbnt purpose. This is a proper and patriotic proceeding. Mr. Nelson is a man of means and a good citizen, and can afford to devote some of his time and money to tho exposure of election frauds for the public benefit. Tho allegations of tho bill set forth that illegal votes wore cast in thlrty-two precincts; tbnt tho judges in tho First Precinct of the Second Ward re fused to admit challengers into their room ; that tho judges in several other voting pre cincts refused to comply with tho low in va rious ways named ; that the veto in tho First Precinct of tho Fifth Ward was not counted, and so on. Tho claim is tbnt those frauds and irregularities were sufficient to change tho result as canvassed. Mr. Nelson’s char acter loaves no room to doubt tbnt these suits will bo prosecuted to the full extent of tho law and his rights. Counting only tho legal votes cast, there is no doubt whatever that bo was elected by a baudsomo majority, and should have his scat. SOME MODIFICATIONS OP THE PBE3P DENT'S FEAN OF RESUMPTION. It is only fair to tho intelligence and hon esty of the American people to assume that tho groat majority of them desire as speedy a return to a steady, uniform, and .universally recognized currency ns can ho secured with out any violent rupture in tho existing rela tions between debtor and creditor or serious disturbance in tho financial status of tho country. Tho number of those so depraved os to favor tho retention of a vacillating and illusive currency for tho politicol benefit of demagogues and tho financial advan tages of speculators, and of those so ignorant as to bo misled by their wild vagaries, is comparatively small Tho formidable resistance encountered by oil plans of ro sumption is not from tho blatant and mean ingless ravings of tho shinplasler advocates, but'from tho wide-spread apprehension of tho business community that there can bo no resumption without a shock, and tho natural tendency to postpone a disagreeable necessi ty os longas possible. II wo oro right in this view, then it only remains for Congress to prepare lor resumption in such a manner as will avoid the evils and trials that are popu larly apprehended. To tho extent that tho natural laws have been violated there must bo somo penalty, and it will not bo possible to resume our normal financial condition without somo suffering for tho abnormal de parture from its fixed and natural laws. But it is tho obvious duty and tho first duty ol Congress to adopt that plan of resumption which shall bring it about at the earliest mo ment with the least strain upon tho public confidence and business. With this end in view, we have outlined the plan suggested by tho President and Sec retary of tho Treasury, who agree materially on the following points: (1) Repeal of tho Legal-Tender act as to all debts contracted after Jan, 1, 1877 j (2) the redemption of greenbacks by a long-term, 8,05 gold bond at tho rate of $2,000,000 a month ; and (8) an accumulation of gold for full resumption on Jim. 1, 1878, by increasing tho revenues ns well oa by selling bonds. This Is the plan which tho President and Secretary commend to Congress, not os tho only nor oven the best plan that can bo adopted, bat for considera tion, unless Congress can suggest an improve ment with tho purpose of resumption stead ily and effectively in view. It is in tho same spirit that wo have commended tho plan in a general way, tho combined effect of which could not fail to improve tho existing condi tion of things. But one criticism has oc curred to us which, in turn, suggests a modifi cation of tho plan and a more strict ad herence to tho ideas advanced by Tas Tiun* uns heretofore in tho same direction. The combined effect of redeeming greenbacks at the rate of $2,000,000 a month and tho accumula tion of surplus gold in a measure which tho country can sustain by taxation, will not ro duco the outstanding Treasury notes below $300,000,000 by Jan. 1, 1879, when full resumption is promised. The gold to redeem this amount can only bo obtained by selling 5 per cent gold bonds, which ore about par. All at once, then, the Government will have to begin the payment of 5 per cent interest to accomplish what it was accomplishing be fore that date on the payment of 8.C5 inter est. la addition to this loss of 1.35 per cent interest on $800,000,000, which might be saved, there will bo a serious disturbance of tho monetary system of tho world occasioned by the withdrawal of that immense amount of gold from tho markets and locking it up for some time, bo it long or short, with which to redeem the outstanding Treasury notes. Ibe plan recommended by the President should bo so modified, therefore, as U> avoid these two serious objections ; and it can be done, we believe, in the following manner s 1, Take away the proposed limitation of $2,000,000 monthly, and take up all the greenbacks offered at tho Treasury with twenty or thirty-year gold Loads at 8.C5 per cent interest, issued in denominations vary ing from S6O to 

SI,OOO. This i», i a one sense, immediate redemption; In another resumption at the end of twenty years. Meanwhile it is giving a definite obligation for our indefinite promise to pay, aud an interest-bearing note instead of a note which* bears no interest. It will be an improved security which, other things being equal, will be eagerly sought by all holders of green backs and the mosses of tho people. It will bo a substantial evidence of redemption in stead of an Insubstantial promise which no inherent guarantee of fulfillment. 2. Having repealed. tbe legal-tender prop, eriy of tbe Treasury notes as to all debts con tracted q/W Jsu. l, 1877, the next step in THE CHICAGO order will bo to place the 3.GJ per cent re* dotnption bonds precisely upon the same status na the greenbacks, viz. s That they shall bo receivable for all debts contracted prhr to Jan. 1, 1877. With this character there will ho no hesitation on the part of the holders of greenbacks to convert them into the redemption bonds and draw the interest thereon. Greenbacks having been retired by this process, the redemption bonds will bo used in the payment 'of all debts contracted prior to Jan. 1, 1877, will bo bold in reserve by the banks as fho greenbacks now aro for tbo redemption of their old notes, and will ho a circulating medium atwhnt they arc worth, the demand and use for which will gradually decrease from Jan, 1, 1877, on and after which all debts will bo contracted and pay able on a gold standard. 3. If * there remain at the end of three years—viz.: Jan. 1, 1879—any greenbacks which have not sought conversion in the JU5r» redemption bonds, let them ho redeemed in gold at the Treasury according to tho promise of tho existing law. Tho strong probability is, that tho amount of unredeemed greenbacks will ho so small that tho ordinary specie ac cumulation in the Treasury will bo equal to their redemption, and it will not bo ncccs snry to obtain gold for redemption purposes by tbo sale of 0 per cent bonds. Tho attrac tion to exchange greenbacks for tho 3.G.7 re demption bonds (tho latter being legal-tender as to oil old debts) will ho so great that hank ers, railroad companies, merchants, all finan cial institutions and business enterprises which keep greenbacks as reserves, or for dividends, or for future payments, will con vert their greenbacks on hand into redemption bonds os rapidly as they can. 4. The result of this combination will bo that practical resumption will date from Jau. 1, 1877, after which all contracts and ex changes will be on n specie basis. The old debts will bo paid in the legal-lender redemp tion bonds, which will bo rocoivoblo for the now debts only for their current value in gold, as English consols or any other na tional obligations bearing n low rote of inter est. The specie will come out ns n circulating medium in proportion to the demand ? prices will bo adjusted accordingly; and gold can bo retained and scoured in any amount equal to the actual demand and necessities therefor. There will ho no longer a baser currency to drive it out of the country, and it will come from other countries to the extent that wo have commodities to offer in exchange for it. o. There would bo by this plan no breaking up of the National Banking system as it is cow organized. Tho banks would redeem their notes issued prior to Jan. 1, 1877, in tho redemption legal-lender bonds? after that date their reserves would bo in gold or gold bonds, instead of greenbacks as at pres ent, and they would only issue notes to tho extent that they would bo able to toko care of them, and in answer to any demand that would make them profitable. Those notes would bo secured then as now by the deposit of United States bonds, and tho only differ ence would bo that tho private capital of the country instead of tho Government credit would furnish tho circulating medium of this country os in tho rest of the civilized world where paper money is at par. Tho principal advantages which this plan has over tho plan as stated by tho President is twofold, viz.; (1) It snves tho country the payment of a larger rato of intorcot to se cure tho gold for redemption in a lump, and also tho derangement which tho withdrawal of a.largo oraount of specie fora long timo from tho markets of tho world would cause ; and (2) it gives no sudden shock, causes no perceptible disturbance, and does not require the present debtors to pay from 18 to 20 per cent more in tho discharge of their obliga tions than they received in-value at tho time their debts were contracted. Thus tho groat objection to resumption is removed, and tho common boon of a uniform and fixed cur rency obtained without oppressing one class for tho benefit of another. For tho rest, it fa a simple and easy modification of the plan proposed by tho President ? and, in default of any reasonable objection to it, would bo bet ter for a first trial than the Secretary of tho Treasury’s suggestion in its original shopo. 

WHAT WILL THE DEMOCRATS DO f Tho tariff looms up again as a theme of political debate in Congress. Tho President and tho Secretary of tho Treasury ha to both urged it upon the consideration of Congress men. What aro they going to do about it 7 Tho Democratic party professes to believe in tho doctrine of revenue reform. If that pro fession is anything more than a pretense, anything more than a trick, anything more than a fraudulent sham, some important stops towards a tariff for revenue alone will bo token during this session of Congress. "What is wonted is not theory and pretense, but practice; not talk, but action. The Democrats hovo nearly two-thirds of the ■ House, and the vote of their Senators, with that of tho Revenue-Reform Republicans in the Senate, can carry any law for a readjust ment of duties through that body. Tho President's message shows that Gen. Quant will certainly approve a law restoring the purely revenue taxes on tea and coffee and another removing or greatly reducing the duties on the raw materials of our manufac turing industries. Secretary Bbistow has famished the necessary data for intelligent legislation on the subject in bis report. What will tho Democrats do ? One of tbo last acts of tbo lost Congress was to increase all tbe protective duties 10 per cent all around. This bos led to no in crease of revenue, but to a loss of nearly $0,000,000. It was not designed or intend ed by its advocates to increase tbo revenue. Its promoters bad no such thought. What they wished to do was' to enable a favored class of “ protected t manufacturers and middlemen to get higher prices from the people for goods on bond and for goods thereafter to bo manufactured. Tbo law was intended to benefit, not the Government, not tbo masses, but special classes of per sons. It wont far to prohibit importation as well as to iuoreoso smuggling and adultera tion. It has cost tbo Treasury six millions of dollars, and bos given tbe people, as con tradistinguished from a few tariff-robbers, not a cent. It has not bettered tbo times or increased employment, but it bos mads it more costly and difficult for tbo laboring classes to live. Tbe interests of toiling mill ions demand a remodeling of the tariff; tbo interests of tbo Treasury, depleted by tbe law as it stands, demand it. And tbe re duction should not stop boro. Tbe raw ma terials of manufactures should bo admitted, as far as possible, free. This is the way to encourage manufacturing Industry, to enable us to export great value in small bulk, os wo ouoo did, and to again command tbe markets of Uiudoslan, of China, of South America, of England herself. Still smother thing that is needed Is a res toration of the duties on tea and ooffoe, which usad to yldd $1£,000,000 to $18,000,. 

TUIBUNE* FRIDAY, DIiCEMRRR 10, IB7S. 000 n year to Uio Treasury. They wore re pealed, not to cheapen these commodities to tho consumer, but to deprive the Government of this amount of revenue, and so compel it to levy other taxon that would '‘protect” Homo manufacturing clique. When this wan done, the Democratic minority in tho llouho voted meanly and sheepishly for it. It re mains to bo soon whether tho Democratic majority Ims any more sense or manhood. The repeal of tho duties on tea and codec has not saved n cent to the consumer. When wo took off tho import taxes, China, Japan, Brazil, and Cuba put on increased export taxes. We still pay tho $18,000,000, hut it goes, not to our own Government, but to the support of Spain and other foreign countries. If wo restore our old taxoa, these countries will have to repeal their new ones, for otherwise the diminished demand boro would diminish their exports. If the Democrats have been honest in their professions of tho past, they will re peal tho recent 10 per cent increase in cus toms, greatly reduce tho duties on all raw material*), extend the free list, and restore tho purely revenue tax on tea and coffee. But the hypothesis of their honesty is a dubious one. THE NEW BISHOP. Tho groat agony is over, and the third Bishop of Illinois has been consecrated with duo foDu and befitting pageant in the Cathe dral which has Peter and Paul for its patron saints. There were floral decorations of great beauty ami costliness, and tho heavy, fogdaden atmosphere with Its suicidal sug gestions were forgotten in tho wilderness of gorgeous flowers which transformed tho Cathedral into a temple fit for tho coronation of th<* goddess of spring. There was an im posing procession of laymen, clergy, Presby ters, Bishops, Vergers, and Canons, with a last man in it who was as stately ns tho first man, with gilded sticks and nil tho insignia and vestment of office. Music lent its in spiring influence with chants and psalms, Gloria and To Dcum, and tho massive cho ruses from tho great oratorios. All good Episcopalians, whether of High Church or of Low Church, whatever their views upon tho Procession of tho Holy Ghost or Auricular Confession, turned out, men, women, and children, to greet tho new Bishop and nss’st at his consecration. Bishops and clergymen came from oil ports of tho country and lent, dignity to the ccmmony, and one patriotic church woman lent her lamb for a christening that in after years ho might trace his name back to this stately occasion. For ono day at least, peace reigns serenely in tho Episco palian fold. Its littlo corner of tho vinoyord wasqoiet, and there were no little Low-Church fox/is to disturb tho grapes or High-Church for.es to harass the vino-dressers. Not a wrangle or a discord jarred upon tho pageant ry of tho ceremony or disturbed tho breasts of the great congregation. They dwelt for ono day in fraternal amity, and lent their hearts and hands and voices to consummate the consecration and swell thopicnns of praise. Thera is every reason to believe that the now Bishop is worthy of tho unanimity, and tho cordiality, and tho splendor of bis reception. He comes to his work with a unanimous in vitation, and with an excellent reputation as an officer of executive ability, and a preacher of exceptional eloquence and talent. Ilia sermon upon "Wednesday evening con firms his possession of tho lattorqualltios. Its' theme was chosen with a certain degree of opplication to the previous condition of his Diocese: “Peace bo unto you: ns my Father bath sent mo, even so send I you.” Under the administration of bis predecessor, able and talented os the late Bishop was, tho Diocese for twenty-throe years was filled with wfmglings and discords, which not only dis turbed tho flock within its own pastures, but brought them into the courts in long and te dious litigations, and disturbed tho whole pnblio and brought scandal upon tho Church. We have every reason to believe that tho new Bishop comes into this Diocese, not bringing a sword, but tho white banner of traco; that bo will speedily restore order and quiet; that ho will harmonize and unite the factions; antf that under bis administration tho Church will march with united front against the works of Satan. If (his shall bo tho consummation of Wednesday’s stately pageant, tho whole pub lic, which has grown tired of Episcopalian discord, will rejoice, and extend a hearty con gratulation to the now Bishop, and repeat tho theme of his first sermon—“ Peace bo unto you.” THE GREAT AMERICAN OSTRICH. Wo publish herewith another letter from Mr. S. D, OaspEMTUn, of Madison, Wia. In this off in tho preceding opistle, published Tuesday morning, he persistently refuses to look at the problem which is fatal to tho scheme of his fhctlon, and so simulates the bird that sticks its head in the sand and fan cies that tbo danger it will not sco no longer exists. Tho problem wo put was this: How shall our merchants convert tho irredeemable paper currency which they receive for their goods into gold, in order to renew their stocks of tea, coffee, sugar, molasses, India rubber, silks, tin, quinine, drags, chemicals, dyes, tropical fruits, and . a thousand other commodities not produced in this country ? Tho merchants and traders of foreign nations will not accept oar redemp ti onlcss shinplostors for their goods. This kind of scrip, which may be forced on Amer ican creditors as legal-tenders in payment of i lebts, is no legal-tender iu oar foreign com merce. At present, and over since the Legal- Tender act was passed, some thirteen or more yaars ago, tbo gold-brokers have bought the legal-tenders at an over-varying discount from tho merchants who «had received them from tho consumers of their good/, and the price in gold thus paid for tho legal-tenders Used and determined their value or pur chasing power. At limes, loss than -10 cents was paid for them; at present, about 8G or 87 cents is their value. When ever the Government adopts the principle of the “Independent party,” and declares that the legal-tenders are never to be redeemed, that they are not promises to pay money but “ money 11 itself, then their value must neces sarily drop down to what they, will be worth for debt-paying purposes, and that will da pend on the quantity in circulation. The more of them that U issued the less they will be worth. To abolish the National Hanks, aui'l aid their circulation to the greenbacks, and at the same time abandon the promise of ultimate redemption, and it is not likely that the gold-brokers will give 20 cents on the dollar for them. Niothing in either ofllr. Caapxirrxa'a let ters, in the debates of the Independent Party Convention he attended In this city, in any of the proaounolamentoa and platforms w) tich hia party has put forth, or in any ut te ranee, spoken or printed, in favor of ine rt* Mumble currency, has been given even a p Inusible answer to the question how the ntirohaaU are to unhang# the Irredeemable scrip currency received for (heir foreign goods into gold in order to renew their slock of foreign goods. It cannot bo answered by any member of tho Independent Bhinplastcr party, and until it is answered these dema gogues ami spoolers would do wisely to stop their noise and nonsense. The idea of receiving greenbacks for cus toms would merely keep tho Government in tho position which importers occupy now. The latter sell their goods for greenbacks and then sell the greenbacks to tho brokers for whatever gold they can get, wherewith they Imv new stocks of goods and pay the duties upon them. Tho Government then uses tho gold thus received (o pay tho inter est on tho national debt and meet the de mands of tho sinking fund. If the duties were paid in greenbacks, tho Government would have to got tho gold somo other way. What would that way bo ? Wo do not know, and nobody else knows, except by selling tho greenbacks to tho gold-brokers. A green back which had no chance of redemption could not bo sold for much gold, so that tho Government could not exchange tho currency received for import-duties for wherewithal to pay Us Interest, except at an enormous loss. It could keep on selling gold-bonds to raise coin to pay interest, for tho debt would then increase at the rate of over $100,000,000 a year, and this would involve speedy bank mptcy and repudiation. Mr. Carprn ter’s plan of on irredeemable “money ” receivable for customs, therefore, so far from enabling merchants to exchange the national currency for gold at par and so of feet tho necessary international exchanges, would prevent their doing so at almost any rate of shave, and would also prevent tho Government’s getting the gold needed to pay tho interest on tho national debt, and thus load speedily to repudiation and bankruptcy. And now, since Mr. Carpenter has beau unable to solve the problem proposed, and since a failure to solve it insures tho certain failure of tho irredeemable-currency scheme which his parly indorses, had ho not hotter frankly confess his mistake and hereafter la bor for tho restoration of what Secretary Bristow rightly colls “ the.,only actual money of tho world aud of tho Constitution ” ? GAMBLING. Only one thing is cosier than to make money in slock speculations,—and Hint is to lose it. Numbers of the stock-jobbers in Wall street are advertising all through the press of the country about the enormous fortunes that can be made in puts and colls. The inexperienced are plied with seductive promises of $25,000 profit from the invest ment of SIOO, and of a moderate compe tency out of the venture of $25, $lO, or oven $5. No sum is too small for the remorse less cupidity of these stock stool-pigeons. Those men know, and are fond of saying to each other, that outsiders always lose money in ‘Wall street. The secret of the present clamorous solicitation to outsiders to come in and moke $25,000 or so from the investment of their spare nickels is that Wall street was never so bare os it is now of amateur opera tors. The experts are left to operate on one another, and know the game too well for mu tual advantage. They must have some sim pler prey, and advertise in hopes of inducing that part of the gullible public which will gamble os far os Wall street and stop short of the faro table to give them a livelihood. The two great centres of this form of rob bery are New York and London. The New York Herald of the 6th inst. says: It Li so axiom Jo Wall street tbst outsiders »Iw»jti lot® money. If there sro exceptions, their oxlslenco ■lmply proves the rule. Men with tittle money cstno into Wall street impressed with the hope sod belief tbst they could make a fortune by one grand coup. They loft it generally minus their money and not In frequently in debt. If no positive losses wero made in stock transactions, the broker’s commlssiou was a cancer that gnawed uneasily at their substance. Tho Inst London Times received alludes to tho some same topic in language equally strong: It is a aonous thing to contemplate the Stock Ex change of London as thus, not as a centre whore sound investing business is done, hut a gambling arena whore the foolish outsider is as certain to lose his money as if he trusted it to an advertising book maker. While dealers and brokers, aided by ad venturers, who were either thdr tools, their decoys, or the reason of their existence, hare been making fortunes out of these miserable products of perverted ingenuity, the public have been losing, and the quiet, unpretentious broker has teen pushed aside and al most threatened with extinction unless he will con tent to embark in the tamo career of speculation. It baa become impossible for an honest mao to guide or* advise hia clients as heretofore amid the whirligig that tbla state of affairs baa produced, when, the nest: hour, or the next day, his advice may bo falsified by the course of tho gambling, in the meantime, what ever the gamblers have lost between themselves haa merely been some part of the general winnings from the public. < It is given to few men to understand as much os their own business. Still more restricted is tho supply of those who can at tend to more than that. Better leave Wall street to Wall street. THE 

TBAMP-HUIOAKOB. Tho people of Ohio are taking hold of tho “ tramp”*nuifianco question in a very vigorous and practical manner, and at the Convention held in Columbus* day before yesterday adopted measures which, if put into speedy and complete operation, will solvo the prob lem so far as Ohio is concerned, and relievo tho people of thot State from supporting able-bodied vagrants any longer. Tho reso lutions which wero adopted suggest thot each locality shall, in the first instance, look after its own vagabonds, so os to prevent tramping as far as possible j that employment of a re munerative chrxacter shall bo furnished to (ramps by the establishment of workhouses sufficiently large to maintain them in oil cities and towns; that magistrates shall be given authority to arrest all vagrants and commit ihem to tho workhouses; that tho practice of giving them free tronsportiou shall bo stopped; and that, after tbo workhouses are in operation, privato charity to this class ■boll cease. Those resolutions go to the very root of the trouble, oud if they ore put in practical operation they will abate the evil of tramping. The “ tramp * was originally a product of New England and New York, and in those sections he still flourishes and obtains sub slstonoo without work. At first the tramps were people who wore too proud to go to the workhouse, and yet were not too proud to go around begging. They traveled frpm place to place in quest of charity, and we re willing to work to earn onoldeoat, a meal of*victuals, or a night's lodging. Their sucoms, how ever, encouraged a host of thieves and va grants who wore not willing to work to go to tramping, and now they number th ousonds, infesting tho small towns and villages, and avoiding the large cities, where they* cannot operate /ud are liable to arrest. Tibe small towns and villages take oars of them, provide them with meals and lodgings, and free transportation from one place to mother. Within the past three or four yean they have secured a regular organization , have mapped oat regular routes from New ' fork to Maine and back, and make their trips at reg ular periods, thus getting a living without work. Where work is offered them they re fuse ft, Homclimos with insults nnd often with violence. Whore (hey ft ml no one or only women at homo, they not only hof? but steal. They hold the rural districts of Now York and Now England at thoir mercy. The evil at Inst grow to such dimension*) that some of the communities began to adopt measures in Bolf.dofonso. Tho ancient and conserva tive City of Salem, Mass., adopted tho initia tive and grappled with tlnj question just an the Puritans in (ho dnya of Endioott and Cotton Maturr would liavo done. Tho city authorities seized tho tramps as fast as they canto within their limits and set them at wort; upon tho roads,thorohj'making them earn thoir bread and bed. As work is tho last thing a tramp wants to do, Salem was speedily freed from tho nuisances. They wont around it. They marked it off thoir maps. They called it Anathema Maranatha. Other places in Now England have adopted tho samo method of dealing with them, aud it has proved success ful in each instance, rinding that their oc cupation is likely to bo disturbed in that part of tho country, they have commenced cmi gratingtothoWcsk They have already reached Ohio and Indiana, and wo shall oro long havo the curso within our own borders. Cleveland has taken timo by tbo forelock and passed a “ tramp-ordinauco " which is said to work ad mirably. The arrangements which havo boon made for tho entertainment of tramps ore thus described by tho Herald of that city : The Street Commissioner will call at the police pfa tfou each moniimraud receive a list of (he men who ere to apply their muscle to the doming of tho airejts. He will then march them to the Bethel, where they will l« furnished a brcakfsst at the coat of the city. They will then bo taken to work la gangs, and allowed to apply the hoe until dinner time. Tbo morning's more In the lino of tbo Bethel will be again taken up, and aftor dinner another chance for dig* gins and scraping will be In order. After supper they will return to Poverty Darn and drop away (o slumber with the feeling that some of them, for tbo first time ni many days, have earned their board and lodging. Cleveland has solved tbo question. 'Work is the remedy which will cure tho tromp-dis ease in every instance. It has never been known to fall, and every city and town in the "West should take measures to sot these lazy, dissolute, worthless, able-bodied va grants at work and make them earn their living. If it is not done, and done speedily, tho West will swarm with them. There is plenty of work, for tho roads are in bad con dition all over tho West. There are only two essentials necessary,—first, to stop private charities to wandering beggars; and, second, to provide tho work for them to. do, and sure means for compelling them to do it, A vig orous dose of this mcdicinoVill relievo any city or town in tho West of trumps in a month's time. Tho London Times takes UlO following view of tbo President's reference to Spain and Cuba in his message : If Bpalo cannot suppreaa the Cuban rebels, if the IflUmJ mint be half ruined while nbo bolds It, If she will not put an end to (hat Institution which Is the main source of diaturbrnco, It would bo bard to oxpoct the United RUtcs to lot tbo work of duvastMlon pro ceed unchecked merely ont of regard to the nominal sovereignty of Spain. Spain In on trial. Tbo limits of her power to restore order will be tho limits of her riuhte. The comment of tbo Tunes goes to show that England is as desirous ns tiro United States that thin war of mutual assassination and extermination shall ccaso both on ac count of her commercial relations and tho money she has invested thoro and in tho in terests of common humanity. It farther more goes to show that if tho time shall come when tho United States will bo com pelled to interfere in this contest, to tako tho two combatants by tho ears and separate them and remand Spain to her place on tho other side of thu ocean, with instructions to stay there, thoro will bo no opposition from any European power, but, on tho other hand, if necessary some of those powers will join with the United States. That such a time must speedily come Is Inevitable. Tho United States must Intervene in tho interests of hu manity, in tho interests of her own invest ments, to preserve her commercial relations, to preserve what little is left of tho island from ultimate destruction, to stop the in cessant drain of gold from this country, and to put Spain where she belongs. The trials of tbo alleged corrupt election judges and of the murderer Davis will toko pluco nest week. The State’s Attorney has bis evidence all ready, and is prepared to go on with tbo trials. The success of justice now depends upon Sheriff Aonkw. Tbo whole community will look to him to select honest, respectable business men to servo upon these juries, and notprofcssional jurors, bummers, or partisans, or corrupt moo, who are always hanging about (o secure such jobs as those. If justice fails'to got her duo, the people will know whore to fasten the re sponsibility, and they are not in the mood to bo trilled with. The cases are of extreme importance, and deserve to bo tried by honest and Intelligent citizens, not by loafers, polit ical bummers, or sympathizers with crime. Sheriff Aoxsw should bo extremely careful in the selection of juries in view of the re sponsibility resting upon him. Senator Boar, of Missouri, has brought himself into notice by -introducing a bill authorizing the payment of duties on imports in legal-tenders and National Bank notes, with tho ourioas deduction that such a course will lead to specie payments, Jnst where this connection comes in is not explained, nor docs Mr. Boar stop to say how tho United States shall raise tho gold to pay the interest on tho debt in tho meantime. Tho bill was referred to the Oommitteo on Finance, whore it will probably sleep quietly daring the session. Oov. Burnt, of Georgia, has published a proo tarnation calling attention to the Transportation Convention which Is to be bold in Chicago Dec. 15, and anting the people to send a full repro* soutation. The Governor holds the subject to be one of groat importance to tbo producers in all parts of the country, and especially to those of the South. He conceivee that the presence of gold ie the result of commercial prosperity aod not the eauee of that prosperity ; and he seec no possibility of a return to epecle pay* meote until we, as a nation, sell more than we buy. To tble end. be eaye, it la necessary that the ooat of transportation to ths seaboard should be reduced speedily and decidedly. The Governor further says, with a certain •otemu triteoeas, that oar wealth cannot be made available nnlil there are ample means of oommunlcation between all parts ot (be country. Wo do not care to agree with all the economical propositions laid down by the Governor, but we do admire and eomtnoud the iutereet he takes in (hie subject of transporta tion, The Governors of other States might profitably imitate hie example, if sol by publish* Ing a treatise on transportation, at least by ad* vertlsing and approving the plan of the Conven tion soon to be held in this city. The Captain of the steamer Sonnyslde, which wa. cut In (wo by the lee on (Up Hudson River a few days ago, testified that he tried to induce a certain passenger, coe PoLiaiq, to leave hie stateroom, but thu man daalioed, saying that he had 180,000 worth of Jewelry with Mm meant to stay by it.

The experience of some London landbrJc Ins supplied tho world with a valuable, hint on tom*, roout-reform. The evil which this reform aimi to removo in two-edged. Tho tenement do itrova tho moral, mental, ami physical health of tho tenants, and tho latter destroy tho tonsim at by a careless use. and often by a wanton destine tion, of stairs, bannisters, doors, windows. ita!cr> pipes, etc. Tho owner’* expenditure for ncw»<. sary repairs la so great that ho puts the ptrioicnl construction on tbo word ‘‘necessary" amldo.s nothing that ho can possibly help. Tho X.ondmi landlords already mentioned Imvo reduced the Item of repairs to lia minimum by a ver/ simple expedient. They sot aside a sura of money lo;<s than tho average expenditure for such things, aucl told their beauts that any part i,l this sum left after tho annual rc. pairs had been made would ho dintul)u:«‘J among them in proportion to tiro rent each paid. This made it tbo ovidoat interest o| every tenant to make tho cost of keeping t!ia building in perfect order as Jittlo as pomiblo. and so make his own share of this pro.nlutn <l3 carefulness as largo as possible. Tbo practical results of Ibis modified form of co-ops. atinn Lo. tween landlord and tenant bavo boon mivju tagoous in tbo highest degree to both. The Interior, no longer being ablo to rerrv cute Prof. Swing or summon him to tnal m heterodoxy, now ridicules bis effort lu preach in an Independent pulpit. Having bounded lira about until it forced him out of the Fomth Church, its impotent malice now follows him Into bis now tbcatro of operations, and hiico.i and laughs at him.

Tbo present editor of the Milwaukee Senfind baa dome difficulty la showing that his employ ment under Mr. SroneT was honorable or do* coot. Tnoso who know tbo character of (ba work that was expooled of bun, sod wbicu lie cheerfully performed, will bear oat the abortion that bis moral seniilblUtlos must have loco blunted before be wont to Milwaukee). Lone service as a hack-writer for corrupt rings ia Milwaukee cannot bare improved him mated ally. A vexatious blunder, occurring in tbo trans mission of our telegraphic correspondence from MllwauaoooD Wednesday, cast an unintended and wholly unmerited slur upon a moat worthy and respected gentleman. Tbo error mado that which was written “A. M. Thomson, Into editor of the SentfnW," read “ a Mr. Thomson," etc. It goes without saying that no such con temptuous reference was contemplated, and ii cau readily be soon bow tbo mistake occurred. The Milwaukee Sentinel offers to open its files for tbo examination of anybody who ho llovoa it has defended tbo WhUuy Ring. Its files show nothing on tho subject; they are a perfect blank. Tboy would not be so if the Milwaukee Sentinel wero earnest in its endeavors to expose tbo corruption of which it Is o«aro. Corruption may bo defended by suppressing the truth as wall as by suggesting a falsehood. Senator Caufxktbo has a forgiving spirit. Hi is now a liberal patron of tbo young man who, as managing editor of tbo Chicago Times, was tbo chief instrument of spreading tho Long Dranoh scandal throughout the Word. In a year or two more, perhaps tho Senator »IU Uo aa active canvasser for Tub Weekly Tuidune ia Wisconsin. Matthew baa emmeut ipuliiic*- (ions for the work of canvassing. Senator Oaupektkq files an affidavit in tho na ture of a bill of discovery against Mr. A. M.
