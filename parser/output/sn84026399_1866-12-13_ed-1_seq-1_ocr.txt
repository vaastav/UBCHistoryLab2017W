John Surratt knew all about this, and do you suppose he is going to stay in Washington aud let them catch him?" His name wa3 the first in the indict ment. Had there been any doubt of his guijt his flight would have removed it, for though none of the principals were more frequently seen up to the 3rd of April, on the afternoon of the 14th was seen for the last time, booted spurreu, rcaay ior uis escape. was a mystery; it was believed he was dead; that he had revealed the names of bis fellow-conspirators to the Government, and had been allowed to escape; that he was secretly imprisoned. It was noted that no reward wa3 offered for his arrest. Yet, as time passed 00, John Surratt was forgotten, till the other day came the startling news that he had been arrested by the American Consul General in De Quiocey, in illustration of the vast empire and power of the Romans, imag ines a fugitive from the vengeance of the Kmperor vainly seeking to. escape his grasp. North, South, East or West, wherever the wretched man may fly, he treads within the circle of Rome, and her hand is raised above him; though he fly to the uttermost part of the earth, Ccesar will be before him. In this age, Justice is as hard to escape. The great criminal hides in vain in foreign lands, changes his name or disguises his person. Sur ratt's peron was - not very easy to dis guise. A tall man, with a prominent forehead and very.large nose, with deep ly sunken eyes and long black hair. Thus he was described at the trial. Of his wanderings little is known. It is said that he was recognized on a Liv erpool steamer shortly after the murder. Then came the rumor, that he was serving as a private soldier in the Pope's Guards at Rome. We know now tbat he ha'd been a soldier in the Papal Zouaves at Vcroli, and served under the name ot John Watson. The fact became known to Mr. Kufus King, our Minister at Rome, who telegraphed to our Government, and was instructed to secure his arrest.. Mr. King conferred with Cardinal Antonelli, who issued an order for his seizure. Sur ratt was taken; he was imprisoned; and on removal from jail, guarded by five sol diers, broke from their hands, jumped, it is said,"over a precipice more than one hundred feet high, and escaped into the Italiau territory. Mr. Marsh, our Minis ter at Florence, obtained telegraphic in structions from the Italian Government to have all the seaports of Italy watched to prevent his escape. He was soon sup posed tj have embarked in a 6teatner for Malta, and a dispatch to that inland ar rived too late to detain him; another wa3 sent to Alexandria, and when Surratt stepped upon the shores of Egypt, be was seized by the strong, far-reacbing arm of America. -United States detectives, it is said, have watched him since October. Rut long before this he must have been dvertaken by a speedier, surer foe. Fear Was ever at his back; from remorse he could hardly escape, for even if he could forget the crime he had committed, how could he ever cease to see the phantom of his mother on the gallows? Coward all the world believed him, since that day when he fled aud left her to suffer; a coward, it was said, she held him, and in her last moments refused to hoar his name. There is true dramatic interest in this imperfect history. The escape and pur suit of no other criminal in this country has so much to excite the imagination. No ican, it is possible, not even Rooth, worked harder to accomplish tho murder; tnd a deeper interest is given to his share in the conspiracy by his frequent journeys to Richmond. Upon Surratt's presumed connection with the Rebel Government, Andrew Johnson charged Jefferson Davis with complicity in the assassination. New revelations are expected from his trial; the public may be disappointed in that, yet if John Surratt eould be induced to confess, before the death which is almost certain to be his fate, there is no reason able doubt but that he might tell the whole story of Lincoln's assassination from the "beginning to the end. - m- How Young Persons are Caught J A friend ot the writer had a young ; man in his office that was very fond of do I in?r inst what other nersnn Hid witlirmt I r 1 - w j , I thinking of the difference in age and cir-j , cumstauces between himself and tho men j went into his barber's shop to be shaved, just as his clerk was coming out of the! same place. The barber did not know that the merchant was acquainted with this boy, so he said to him, "Did you no-j tice that lad that went out as you came! in ?" "Oh ! yes," said the merchant. "Well," remarked the barber, that boy has bis shaving-pot and razor here, and ho comes in every day to be shaved, al though he has not a hair upon his face?" He wanted to do as others did, no matter what it cost him, or how silly he appear ed ; and this and other things came very proving the boy's ruin. Now, boys will make themselves sick learning to smoke or chew tobacco; they will bring upon themselves a most expen sive babit, and one that may seriously, if not fatally injure that health, in order to do as others do. This is the way tho monkeys were caught! Many fall into the habit of Sabbath break ing, because they see others seeming to take pleasure in such a course, and with out thinking of the sad consequences that may follow if they do as others do. This is tho way the young man falls into the temptation of drinking The company around him sip the wine. He dreads to be singular, although to stand alone is often to stand with God ! Appa rently very respectable people drink wine. The evil consequences do not appear at once. They must do as other people do, so they begin to draw on the dreadful boots ! How much misery follows in the train when one seeks to do as other persons do. The young man has made the acquain tance of gay young fellows of his own age. Their parents are rieh, and he is flattered by their uotice. He is invited to their houses and is offered wine at their tables. He must do, he thinks, a3 other people do. The lads take him to the billard room, and of course he must play with them. They then give him a treat of oysters and wine before he leaves for his home. Now he must do as they do. In his turn he must order them a fine supper at some noted restaurant. This continues month after month. He, by and by, comes home to his Christian mother, late at night, so excited by liquor that he is al most beside himself. O, the agony of that home ! Dut this is only the beginning. He has drawn the boots on, but how shall he remove them ! His parents are neither able nor willing to supply him with money to be expended for such purposes. Dut he is so involved in the round of dissipa tion upon which he has entered that he cannot tear himself away from it. As he cannot obtain money honestly, he now falls into the temptation of taking it dishonest ly. Ruin does not wait long for him then. He is discovered ; he is arrested, and seme place of restraint or punishment closes its door upon him. This is the his tory of many brighj boys that have, and are still, iu House of Refuge. Never follow another unless you know he is in the right path ; and never fear to stand up alone for the right. Burning of Artillery Horses Destruction of Oxd-time Caissons. HAitnismJiKi, Dec. 1. A warehouse at the corner of Canal and State streets caught fire at about half-past one o'clock this. morning and burned to the ground. Among the property injured and destroy ed were twenty-two pieces of artillery, be longing to the State, mostly old brass six pounders, for school practice and drilling. The carriages were of course burned, but most ot the iron was saved. The pieces can be remounted for about two hundred and fifty dollars apiece, so that the total loss to the State will not oxceed five or six thousand dollars. None of the late improved armory is lost, the pieces burned' having been btored in the ware house from a want of room in the State Arsenal. The . building was owned by Mrs. Curtis, but had been leased by the State. The fire was undoubtedly the work of an incendiary. The Alabama Legislature. Special despatches state that in the Al abama Honso of Representatives yester day, Mr. Rrooks, of Lowndes county, pre ecnted a bill to alter the Constitution of the State, to admit couditional negro suf frage. The conditions aro that the voter shall possess property valued at 8200, and shall bo able to read the Constitution of tho State and of the United States, and write a legible hand ; theso conditions holding good also in case of white men. Mr. Rrooks was closely identified with the Confederate cause, having expended his Jast dollar in its support, and in pre senting his bill said that ho did so as a measure of policy and public good. Af ter an excitiug debate tho bill was tabled. SYNOPSIS OF THE President's Message. The President starts out with a refer ence to his last annual message, on the subject of restoration giving a detailed statement of whtt had been done, up to that time, in the work of restoring the late rebellions States to their former status in the Union. He then says : In the meantime, the Executive, De partment no other plan having been pro posed by Congress continued its efforts to perfect, as far as was practicable, the restoration of the proper relations between the citizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, ex tending, from time to time, as the public interest seemed to require, the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the coun try. With fhe advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary officers were ap pointed, and appropriations made by Con gress for the payment of their salaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so as to prevent the exis tence of slavery within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction was ratified by the requisite number of States; and on the 18th day of Decem ber, 18G5, it was officially declared to have become valid as a part ofthe Constitution of the United States. All of tho States in which the insurrection had existed promptly amended their Constitutions, so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in the organcic law of the land ; declared null and void all ordinances and las of secession ; repudi ated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the insurrection ; and proceeded, in good faith, to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation ; and it was not until towards the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was made in favor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators and Represen tatives. I deem it a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representa tives from the other States, whose inhab itants, with those of Tennessee, had en gaged in the rebellion. Ten States more than one-fourth of the whole number remain without representation ; the seats of fifty members in the House of Repre sentatives and of twenty members in the Senate are yet vacant not by their own consent, not by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is be lieved, would have accomplished much towards the renewal and strenghtening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those States. It wuld have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the Declaration of Ameri can Independence,that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation, and yet be denied the right of representation. It would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that " each State shall have at least one Representative," and "that no State, with out its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate." These provisions were intended to secure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress; and so important was it deemed by the farmers of the Consti tution that the equality of the States in the Senate should bo preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitu tion can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in thai branch of the National Legislature. It is true, it has been assumed that the existence of the States was termiuated by the rebellious act of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection haviug been suppressed, they were thenceforward to be considered merely as couquered territories. The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Departments ofthe Govern ment have, however, with great distinct ness and uniform consistency, refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and with the professed objects of the war. Throughout the recent legislation of Con gress, the undeniable fact makes itself apparent, that these ten political commu nities arc nothing less than Statos of this Union. The President then refers to tho legis lation of Congress, and the proclamations of Lincoln sustaining this position. Ho then proceeds as fellows : In thi admission of Senators and Rep resentatives from any and all tho States, there can be no just ground of apprehen sion that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation; for this could not happen when the Con stitution and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each house is made the " judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own mem bers," and may, " with tho concurrence of ' two thirds, expel a member." When a Senator or Keprescntative presenre nis certificate of flection, he may at once bo admitted or rejected; or should there be any question as to eligibility, his creden tials may bo referred for investigation to tho appropriata committee. If admitted to a seat, it must be upon evidence satis factory to tho House of which he thus ' becomes a member, that ho possesses tho requisite Constitutional and legal qualifi cations. If refused admission as a mem ber for want of due allegiance to the Gov ernment, and returned to his constituents, they are admonished that none but per sons loyal to the United States will be al lowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of the nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus ef fectively exerted iu the interests of loyal ty to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Upon this question, so vitally affecting the restoration of the Union and permanency of our present form of gov ernment, my convictions, heretofore ex pressed, have undergone no change; but, on the contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflections and time. If the admission ot loyal members to seats in the respective Houses of Congress was wise aud expedient a year ago, it is no less wiaev and expedient now. If this anomalous condition is right now if, in the exact condition of these States at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them from representation, I do not see that the question will be changed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, tho right of represen tation will be no stronger the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to re commended to the consideration of Con gress " such measures as he shall judge necessary or expedient." I know f no measure more imperatively demanded by every consideration of national interest, sound policy, and equal justice,than the ad mission of loyal members from the now un represented States. This would consum mate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary influence in the re-establishment of peace, harmony and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the Amercan people in the vigor and stability of 4heir institu tions. It would bind us more closely to gether as a nation, And enable us to show to the world the inherent and recupera tive power of a Government founded up on the will of the people, and established upon the principles of liberty, justice and intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of our republican government. The ad mission of loyal members from the States now excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn cap ital, now awaiting an opportunity for in vestment, into the channels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the present cendition of those States, and, by induc ing emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead to an increased production of those sta ples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and the commerce of the world. Xew fields of enterprise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon the devastations of war would be re paired, and all traces of 6ur domestic dif ferences effaced from the minds of our countrymen. He next warns the people against the danger of centralization of power, in the following language : In our efforts to preserve "the unity of Government which constitutes us one peo ple," by restoring the' States to the con dition which they held prior to the rebel lion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued our nation, from perils of thwat cned disintegration, we resort to consoli dation, and in the end absolute despotism, as a remedy for the recurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the exercise of doubtful constitutionality, we should has ten to briug legislation within the bound aries prescribed by the Constitution, and to return to the ancient landmarks estab lished by our fathers for the guidance of succeeding generations "The Constitu tion which at any time exists, until chang ed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." 44 It, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be, in any particu lar wrong, let it be corrected by an amend ment in the way in which the Constitu tion designates. Rut let there bo no change by usurpation, for it is the custo mary weapon by which free Governments are destroyed." WashingtoSi spoke these words to his countrymen when, followed by their love and gratitude, he volunta rily retired from the cares of public life. " To keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, aud cherish the Federal Union as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his 44 countrymen tne true principles of their Constitution, and promote a union of sentiment and action eouallv auspicious to their happiness and safety." Jackson held that the actiou of r .n .lit the General uovernment should always be strictly confiucd to the 6phere of its arpropriato duties, aud justly and forci bly urged that our Government is nQt to bo maintained nor our Union preserved ' by invasions of the rights and powers of the several fctates. In thus attempting to mako our General Government strong, we make it weak. Its true strength con sists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to themselves; in raak iug itself felt, not in its power, but in its beneficence; not its coutrol, but in its protectiou; not in binding tho States moro closely. to the centre, but leaving each to move uuobstructcd in its proper constitutional orbit." Theso are the teachings of mcu whose deeds and cervi ces have made them illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn from scenes of life, have left to their country the rich legacy of their example, their wisdom, and their pataiotism. Drawing fresh inspiration from their lessons, let us emulate them in love of country and respect for the vunsuiuuon and the laws. He next reviews the reports of the sev eral Heads of Departments. The President then proceeds to dis cuss our foreign affairs. He says that with Great Britain the progress toward an adjustment of the Alabama claims has been slow, owing in some degree to a change in the British Ministry, but mat ters in that regard look favorable. He states that France has not complied with her agreement to take her troops out of Mexico, but has intimated a postpoa ment till spring. This government has remonstrated, but the President says no reply has been received from the Empe ror as to what he will do, but a satisfac tory adjustment i3 hoped for. General Sherman has merely gone to Mexico ia an advisory capacity to Campbell. The Message is silent on the questions of a Mexican profectorate and treaty, kc.t and makes no allusion to Maximilian whatever. In concluding the Message the Presi dent says: 44 The interests of the nation are best promoted by the revival of fraternal rela tions, the complete feliteratioa of our differences, and the inauguration of all the pursuits of peace. Directing our ef forts to the early accomplishment of theso great ends, let us endeavor io preserve harmony between the co-ordinate depart ments ofthe government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing the mainte nance ofthe Constitution the preservation of the Union, and the perpetuity of free institutions." Special despatches to the Inquirer J Washington, Dec. 2, 1SGG. The Message and Accompanying Docu menst. The President's Message will refer to tho restoration ofthe Southern States at length. His point will be that Congress should admit Southern Representatives to seats in the councils of the nation. He considers that tea States remain without representation and looks upon this as injustice, while if they were ad mitted their appearance in Congress would. tend to strengthen the Union. He is not of the opinion that disloyal men would bo allowed seats at the Capitol- while the Senate and House are judges of the rights of persons applyinTor admission. Secretary McCulIoch s report will prove- of interest to the nation It is prepared with great care, and the Secretary ex presses his views in reference to our cur rency and the revenue system in a man ner which will attract the attention of Congress. The conditioaof the National debt is represented as satisfactory, its diminution for the pat year and a half being over $200,000,000. The receipts of the fiscal year ending June 30, are understood to have reached the sum'of $558,000,000, while tho ex penditures were but $520,000,000. Re duction of taxation is recommended. Secretary Stanton's report gives valu able information respecting the operations of the ar Department during the past W . Ml . "11 year, it will be concise, out wni em brace a vast amount ef information, such as will show that we are ready for any emergency. Secretary elles will make an exhibit of near three hundred men-of-war, sup plied with the best guns known. He al so will indorse League Island as a suita ble site for an iron-ciad navy yard. Postmaster-General Randall and Se cretary Drowning of the Interior, have their reports made out and in type. They will be perused with much interest, more especially that of the Iuterior Department. Exports and Imports. Among the new institutions of thi country, under the charge of the Govern ment, may be mentioned the Statistical Bureau, recently organized at Washing ton, which has just made its report of transactions for the last four mouths. This statement does not show a very grati fying condition of affairs for the country. It sum3 up the value ot the imports dur ing that time at $127,557,010, while tho exports are but
