This year a new school board was elected, which will put an end to this expense. The issue was made by tho adoption of a resolution tlint "no lawzuage but the English should be taught at public expense in the pri mary and district schools," and the candidates nominated on this issue were elected by a majority of four thousand. An exchange pleading for better sup port of ministers, says: "The idea that a clergyman is a sort of air-plant, subsisting partly on congregational doles, partly on the zeal of his calling, which may "eat him np," but does not feed his family, and that he al ways to be in the attitude of taking gifts,does not add to his dignity or to that of the ministry." Hard cash, and that with promptness and regu larity,and a reasonable amount of it, also, is quite essential to clergymen, and the congregation that does not appreciate this fact is not to be pitied if compelled to "poor preach for poor pay." Nearly a thousand natives of Nor way, Sweeden and Denmark, mostly from Minnesota, Dakota and Wiscon sin, sailed a few days ago from New York for their native countries. The Scandinavians of the West now make annual pilgrimages to the old country during the holiday season, The fact that they are able fo do so, being prosperous and many of them wealthy, speaks volumes for this element of our population. They get very low railroad and steamer rates, and are better emigration agents than any others. Many of them have opened farms at the West and on their re turn will be accompanied by a help meet of the gentler sex. While comparatively little money is now sent west "to move the crops," owing to the increase of wealth in the west, still the west is,very largely de pendent upon Eastern capital, and a great deal of the latter has found prof itable investment in farm mortgages, the rate of interest on which is much higher in the new than in the older States. A Western newspaper has gathered some statistics on this sub ject of farm mortgages that are both interesting and instructive. From them we learn that the farmers of the West have borrowed from the Eastern capitalist States of New England, New York and Pennsylvania over twelve hundred and fifty millions of dollars, and that they pay in interest thereon not less than eighty millions of dol lars yearly, while the total value of farm property in twelve Western States is $3,143,000,000. The financiers of the East begin to realize that the West is self-support ing. In some interviews in New York on the financial outlook, Mr. George H. Potts. President of the Park Na tional Bank, said: "As to the return of currency from the West, it is dif ferent with us in this regard lrom what it was a few years ago. Then, when we shipped currency to the West, we were almost sure to get it back in a month or two. Now it does not seem to return at all, or if it does, it is in such an indirect way that we hardly know it, and since the creation of the new reserve centres I think-it iB hardly worth while for us to antici pate any large amount of return in the way of currency in the future."

Knox, formerly comf troler of the Treasury,' now President of the National Bank of the Bepublic said: "The regular return of money to 4his centre stopped as a natural re» suit of the stable and always increas ing enterprises of the West and South.

SENATE. The Senate was organised withouttroub* le. There has been and there will be no deadlock. The Republicans did not ob ject to swearing in of Democratic senators, add the Democratic senators did not ob ject to the administration of the oath to the Republican senators. But one senator is kept standing at the door—Mr. Faulkner of West Virginia—and he stands asiile with the common consent of both parties in the senate, obtained just before the aesembling of tho senate as the result of a compromise. His credentials are alleged to be irregular on their face. Mr. lurpie of Indiana took the oath and subscribed his name to the book of oaths and holds his seat upon his credentials. Mr Hoar objected for the time being to administering the oath of office to Mr. Faulkner. He understood that, whatever question arose concerning the title of that senator to a seat, arose on the credentials them sel res, the whole proceedings of the legisla ture and the history of the case being there disclosed and fully recited. Assuming that, in accordance with the usages of the senate, he would himself bo a member of the com mittee on privileges and elections, he gave theassurance that the question should bo dealt with at the earliest possible moment, so that the gentleman entitled to tho seat would be able to enter on the discharge of his duties as senator. Mr. Kennasnid that the course suggested seemed eminently appropriate and he trusted that the actibn would be taken without the formality of a vote. This sug gestion was adopted and the board ad adjourned. HOUSE. The roll call which followed. the calling to order of the house was interrupted just as it began by a crank, who, pitting in tho northeast corner of tho gallery, started up the doxology ns the gavel came down, and had finally to be hauled out bodily by the heels before he would stop. Mr. Clark called for nominations for speaker. Sunset Cox nomina ted John C. Carlisle, and Cannon nominated Thomas B. Reed. Ran dall. Mills, McKinley and Long of Massa chusetts were called on to act as tellers. But 313 votes were cast, of which Carlisle got 163, and Reed 148. Nichols of North Carolina and Smith of Milwaukee voted for Brurnm, the Greenback Republican from Pennsylvania. The clerk then ap pointed Reed and Cox a committee to es cort Mr. Carlisle to the floor of tho house. Judge Kelby of Pennsylvania, as tho oldest member of the house, stepped forward and administered the oath to Garliijle, and the latter, taking tho gavel, became for the third time speaker of the house. He spoke at some length, mostly on the vital ne cessity of reducing taxes so us to avoid the dangerous surplus in the treasury. The speech was received with satisfac tion on both Hides, the slight key notj of protection which entered into his tariff re duction comments being especially pleas ing to the Randall Democrats. The procesii of electing officers of the house was much as usual, Cox offering a resolution embodying the names adopted by the Democratic caucus, and Cannon of fering an amendment to substitute the names selected by the Republican caucus. After drawing seatB the House adjourned. SENATE. The president sent the following nomin ations to the senate: Lucius Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi, as sociate justice of the supreme court of the United States William F. Vilas of Wiscon sin, secretary of the interior Don M.

FIFTIETH C0N8RESS. I PROHIBITION SUSTAINED. JAMES 0. BLAINE. 'J he United States Supreme Court De» tides the Kansas Prohibition Cases, in Favor of the State. An Exhaustive Disquisition Upon the Bight of a State to Enact and En force Prohibition Laws. WASHINGTON, Deo. 5.—A very importani decision, and one likely to be far-reaching la its consequences, was rendered in the United 8tates supreifte court to-day tn the Kansai ptohibition case* of Mngler atrainst the Sfcatt of Kansas and the State of Kansas against Zle bold and others. The judgment of the couri was announced in a long opinion by Justice Harlan, who said: The general question in each case is whethei the prohibition statutes of Kansas are in conflict •with that clause of tho fourteenth amendment, which provides that "no state Bhall make or en force any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of tho United States, nor shall any state dtprivo any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." That lcirtalation by a ntato prohibiting the man ufacture within her limits of intoxicating liquors, to be tlmre sold or bartered for (reneral use as a beverage, does not necessarily infringe anv right, privilege or Immunity secured by the constitution of the United States, is made cleai by the decisions of the court rendered before and since the adoption of the fourteenth amend ment. It is. however, con tended that, although the statu may prohibit the mauufactflre of in toxicating ilqtaors for ssile or irter within her limits for (reneral use as a beverage, no conven tion or lefrfslature has the right under our form of government to prohibit anv citizen from manufacturing for his own nse or for export or storage, any article of food or drink not endangering or affecting the rights of others. The argument made in support of the first branch of this proposition is: That in the implied compacts, between the state and the citizen, certain rights are reseived by the latter which are guaranteed by thr constitutional provisions for the pro tection of life, liberty and property against de privation without due process of law and with which the state cannot interfere: that axoim theso rights is that of manufacturing for one's own use either food or drink that, whilo ac cording to the doctrines of the commune, the state may control the tastes, appetites, habits, dress, food and drink of the citizen, our syntem of government, based upon the individuality and intelligence of the people, does not claim to control him except as to his conduct to others, leaving him the sole judge as to all that only affects himself. It will be observed that the proposition and the argument modo in support of it equally concede that the right to manu facture drink for one's personal use is subject to the condition that such manufacture does not endanger or AFFECT THE BIGHTS OF OTHERS. If such manufacture does prejudicially affect the rights and interests of the community, it follows from tho very premises stated by coun sel that society has the power to protect itself by legislation against tho injurious consequences of that business. As was paid in Mum vs. Illi nois (94 U. S., 124), while power does uot exist with the wholo people to control rights that are purely and exclusively private, government may require each citizen so to conduct himself and so to use his own property as not unnecessarily to injure another. But by whom or by what au thority is it to be determined whether the man ufacture of particular articles of drink, eitiier for general use or for tho oer^onal use of the maker, will injuriously affect the public? Power" to determine such questions so as to bind all muet exist sojnewhere, else society will be at the mercy of the few who, regarding only their own appetites or passions, may b3 willing to imperl the peace and security of the many, provided only they are aliowed to do as they please. Under our system that power is lodged with the legis lative branch of the government. It belongs to that department to exert the police powers of the state. It must determine primarily what measures are appropriate or needful for the pro tection of the public morals, the pnblio health or the public safety. It does not at all follow from these principle# that every statute enacted ostensibly for the promotion of these ends is to be accepted as a legitimate exertionef the police powers of the state. There are of necessity iimits beyond which legislation cannot rightly go. As the courts must obey the constitution rather thau the law-making department of the government, It must upon its responsibility de termine whether in auy particular case these limits have been passed. The courts are not bound by imre torms nor are they to be misled by mere pretenses. They are at liberty—indeed: are under a solemn duty—to look at the sub-' stance of thiugs whenever thev enter upon the Inquiry, whether the legislature has transcended, the limits of itB aathority. If, therefore, a statuto purporting to have been enacted to pro tect tho public health, the public morals or the public safety, ban no real or substantial rela tions to those objects of rights secured by the tundamental law. it is the duty of the courts to BO adjudge and thereby give effect to the consti tution. Keeping in view these principles as governing the relations with each other of the Judicial and legislative departments of govern ment, it is DIFFICULT TO PEKCEIVE ANY GBOUND for the judiciary to declare ttyat the prohibition by Kansas of tho manufacture or sale within her limits of intoxicating liquors lor general use there as a beverage is not fairly' adapted to the end of protecting the community against the evils which confess2dty result from the excess ive use of ardeut spivits. There is here no jus tification for holding that the state, under the guise of police regulations, is aiming to deprive ths citizen of his constitutional rights for we canuot shut out of view the fact, within the knowledge of all, that the public health, the public morals and the public safety may be en dangered by the general use of intoxicating drinks. Nor can we ignore the fact, established by statistics accessible to every one. that th8 disorder, pauperism and crime prevalent in the country are in large measure directly traceable to this evil. If, therefore, a state deems the ab solute prohibition of tne manufacture and sale within her limits of intoxicating liquors for other than medical, scientific and manufacturing purposes to be necessary to the peace and dignity of socicty, the court s cannot, without usurping legislative functions, override the will of the people as thus expressed by Lheir chosen representatives. It is a fundamental principle in our institutions, indispensable to the preservation of public liberty, that one of these departments of government shall not usurp powers committed by the constitution to another department. And so, if in the judg ment of the legislature the manufacture of in toxicating liquors for the maker's own use as a beverage would tend to cripple, if not to defeat her efforts to guard the community against the evils attending the excessive use ot' such liquors, it Is not for the courts, upon their views as to what is beat and safest for the community, to disregard the legislative determination of that question. So far from such a regulation being Inappropriate to the general end sought to be accomplished, it is easy to be seen that the entire scheme of prohibition, as embodied in the constitution and laws of Kansas, might fail if the right of each citizen to manufacture intoxicating liquors for his own use as a beverage were recog nized. Such a right does not Inhere in citizen ship. Nor can it be said that the government in terferes with or Impairs any onn's constitutional rights of liberty or of property when it deter mines that the manufacture and teenth Austin Bixby, Lieut. Marsh Bale $r 6f intoxi­ cating tlrinks for general or individual use as a beverage are or may become hurtful to society and to every member of it. and is therefore a business in which no one can lawfully engage. This conclusion is unavoidable unless the four teenth amendment of the constitution takes from the states of the Union those powers of police that were reserved at the time the orig inal constitution was adopted. But this court has declared, upon full consideration (in Bar bier vs. Connelly. 113 U. S., 31.)'that, the four­ amendment bad no such effect. THE PBOPEBTX OBJECTION. With reference to the assertion that the prohibition of -the manufacture and Bale of liquor deprives liquor dealers of their prop erty without due process of law, the court says: All property under our form of government is subject to the obligation that it shall not be need so as to injuriously affect the rights of the community and thereby become a nuisance. The State of Kansas bad a right to prohibit the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away the property of the brewers. It simply abated a nuisance. The property is not taken awav from its owners. They are onlv prohibited l'rom using it for specific purpose, which tho legislature de clared to be injurious to the community. Foi the reasons stated, we are of the opinion that Mugler, the plaintiff in error, has not been de nied by the judgments of the supreme court of Kansas any right, privilege or Immunity se cured to him by the constitution of the United States, and its judgment in each case is accord ingly affirmed. We are also of the opinion that the circuit court of the United States erred in dismissing the bill of the state in her suit against Ziebold and Hagelin. The deoree In that case is reversed and Xhe cause remanded, with directions to enter deoree granting to the state such relief as the act of March 7, 1385, authorises. A decision was rendered in the Virginia habeas corpus cases of Attorney General Ayers and Commonwealth's Attorneys Scott and McCabe, who were imprisoned by order of Judge Bond, of the United States circuit court, for disobedience to a restraining order forbidding them to bring suit tor the collection of taxes in cases where tenders had been made by tax receiv able coupons cut from state bonds. The clecisibn is strongly in favor of the. State,' and against U. 8. Judge Bond's notion. The snow cuts of the Manitoba in If on tana worked remarkfbly well during the recent storm.

The American Statesman, No% In Fsrls, Sharply CrltfcUei tho Menage of Mr. i Cleveland. NEW YOBK, Dec. 7.—The Trlbnne of to morrow will contain a long interview with Hon. James G. Blaine in Parr s on President Cleveland's message. It is as follows: "I have been reading a'n abstract of the president's message and have been especially in terested in the oomincnts of the London papers. Those papers all assume to declare the message is a tree trade manifesto and evidently are antic ipating an enlarged market for English fabrics in the United States as a consequence of the president's recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more cleanly than any words of mine can." 'You don't mean actual free trade without duty?" queried the reporter. "No," replied Mr. Blaine. "Nor do the London papers mean that. They simply mean that the president has recommended what in the United States is known as a revenuo tariff, rejecting the protective feature as an object, and not even per mitting protection to result freely as an incident to revenue duties. For the firat time in the his tory of the United States the president recom mends retaining the internal tax in order that the tariff may bo forced down even below the fair revenue standard. He recommends that the tax on tobacco be retained, and thus that many millions annually shall be levied on a do mestic product which would far better come from a tariff on foreign fabrics. I should urge the repeal of the tobacco tax at once, even before the Christmas holidays. It would in the first place bring great relief to growers of tobacco all over the country, and would, moreover, materi ally lessen the price of the article to consumers. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The luxury of yesterday becom°s a necessity to-day. The only excuse for such a tax is the actual ne cessity under which the government found itself during the war, and ^he years immediately fol lowing. To retain the tax now in order to de stroy the protection which would incidentally flow from raising the same amount of money on foreign imports, is certainly a most extraordi nary policy for our government. I would not advise the repeal of the whisky.tax. Other con siderations than those of financial administra tion are to be taken Into account with regard to whisky. There is A 

MORAL SIDE TO IT. To cheapen the price of whisky is to Increase the consumption enormously. There would be no sense in urging the reform wrought by high license in inanv states, if the national govern ment neutralizes the good effect by making whisky within reach of every one at 20 cents a gallon. Whisky weuld be everywhere dis tilled if the surveillance of the government were withdrawn by the remission of the tax. It would destroy high license at once in ail the states. Whisky has doue a vast, deal of harm in the United States. I would try to make it do some good. 1 would use the tax to fortify, our cities on tho seaboard. In view of the powerful letter addressed to the Democratic party on the subject of fortification by the late Samuel J. Tilden in 1885,1 am amazed that no attention has been paid to the subject by the Democratic administration. So long as there is whisky to tax I would tax it, and when the na tional government should have no UBe for the money I would saivide the tax among the federal union with the specific objeot of lightening tho tax on real estate. Tho houses and farms of the whole country pay too large a proportion of the total taxes, if ultimately re lief could be given in that direction it would, in my judgment, be a wise and beneficent polioy. Some honest, but misguided friends of temper ance have urged that the government should not use the money derived from the tax on whisky. My reply is that the tax on whisky by the fed eral government, with its suppression of all illicit distillation and consequent enhancement of price, has been a powerful agent in the temper ance reform by putting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount of whisky consumed in the United States per capita to-day is not more than 40 per cent of that consumed thirty years ago. In my judgment the whiskv tax should be so modified as to permit all who use pure alcohol in mechanioal pursuits to have it free of tax. In all such cases the tax could be omitted without danger of fraud. I should seriously object to the repeal of the duty ou wool. To repeal that would work great Injustice to many interests, and would seriously discourage what we should earnestly encourage, namely, the sheep culture among farmers throughout the Uuion. To break down wool growing and be dependent on foreign countries for the blanket under which we Bleep and the coat that covers our backs is not a wise policy for the national government to enforce." "Do you think if the president's recommenda tion were adopted it would 

INCBEASE OUB EXPORT TBADE?" Possibly in some few articles of peculiar con struction it might, but it wonld increase our import trade ten-Mid as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen and cotton goods, in iron, in steel, in all the thousand and one shapes in which they are wrought. How are we to ex port staple fabskss (o the markets of Europe unless we make them cheaper than they do in Europe, and how are we to manufacture them cheaper than they do unless we get cheaper labor than they have in Europe? The question of labor underlies the whole subject. It is, in fact, the entire question. Whenever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every department to work as cheaply and live as poorly in the Untted States as sim lar workmen in Europe, we can, of course, manufacture Just as cheaply as they do in England and France. But I am totally op posed to a policy that would entail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to a social aad finan cial revolution, one that would bring untold dis tress. The moment you begin to import freely from Europe your drivoourown workmen from mechanical and manufacturing pur3uits. In the same proportion they become tillers of the soil, increasing steadily the agricultural product and decreasing steadily the large home demand, which is constantly enlarging as home manu facturers enlarge. That, of course, works great injury to the farmer, glutting tho market with his products and tending constantly to lower prices." "Yes, but the foreign demand for farm prod ucts would be increased in like ratio, would it not?" "Even suppose it were," said Mr. Blaine, "how do you know the source from which it will be, supplied. The tendency in Russia to-day and in the Asiatic possessions ot England is toward large increase of the grain supply, the grain being raised by the. cheapest possible labor. Manufacturing countries will buy their bread stuffs where they can get them cheapest, and the enlarging ot the home market for the Ameri oan farmer being checked he would search in vain for one of the same value. His foreign sales are already checked by the great competi-" tion abroad. There never was a time when the Increase of a large hom^ market-was so valuable to him. The best proof is that the farmers are prosperous iu proportion to the nearness of manufacturing centers," and a protective tariff tends to spread manufactures'" "But those holding the president's views," re marked the reporter, "are" always qnotlng the great prosperity of the couniry under the tariff of 1846." "That tariff did not involve the one destructive point recommended by the president, namely, the retaining ot direct Internal taxes In order to abolish Indirect taxes lsvled on foreign fabrics. But the country had peculiar advantages under it by the Crimean war involving England, France and Russia and largely impairing their trade. All these incidents were immensely stimulating to trade in the United States, regardless of the nature of our tariff. But mark the end of this European ex perience with the tariff of 1846. Its enactment was immediately followed by the Mexican war then in 1848 by the great convulfions of Europe then in 1849 ant succeeding years by the enormous gold yield in California The powers made peace in 1856. and at the same time the output of cold in California fell off. Immedi ately the financial panic of 1857 came upon the country with disastrous force. Though we had In these years mined a vast amount of gold in Cali fornia, every bank in New York was compelled to suspend specie payment. Pour millions la gold had been carried out of the country in eight years to pay for goods that should have been manufactured at home, and we had years of de pression and distress as an 

ATONEM&TT FOB OUB FOLLT. It is remarkable that President Polk recom mended the tariff of 1846 on precisely the same ground that President Cfeveland recommends a similar enaotment now. namely, the surplus in the treasury was menacing the prosperity of the country. History Is repeating itself. Mr. Polk insisted on emptying the treasury by a free trade tariff, then immediately rushed the country into debt by borrowing $150,000,000 for the Mexloan war. I trust nothing may occur to repeat so disastrous a se quel to the policy recommended by President Cleveland. But the uniform fate has been for fifty years past that the Democratic party when it goes out of power always leaves an empty tressury, and when It returns to power always finds a fall treasury. I would make here and there some changes In the tariff, not to reduce protection, but wisely foster It. No great system of revenue like our tariff can operate with QfQolenoy and equity un less the changes of trade be closely watched and the law promptly adapted to these Changes. But I would make ne cmange that would Impair the protective character of the whole body of the tariff laws. The reporter repeated the question wheth er ths president's recommendation would not, if adopted, jjive ns the advantage of a large increase In exports "I only repeat," answered Sir. Blaine, "that it wonld vastly enlarge our imports, while the only export it would seriously in crease' would be our gold .and sliver. That wonld flow out bounteously. Just as it did under the tariff ot 1846. The president's recommendation »naote$ Into law would result, as did an experiment in drainage of a man who wished to torn a swamp into a productive field.
