E IT O I A PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's message was read to both branches of congress Tuesday. It consists of a voluminous sermon of some 26000 words and can be read in full on pages 3 and 4 of this issue. It contains nothing startling and those who are interested in tariff re vison, will find nothing in the mes sage along this line, except that he recommends the passage of the free trade bill with the Filipenos, with out, delay. He asks for fair treatment toward the Japanese and recommends the passage of an act to naturalize Jap ense who wish to become citizens and he states that the Government has not ample power through our courts to protect .aliens in the rights secured them through treaties. Inheritance and income tax laws are urged by nim as a means to stop the enlarging of swollen fortunes. A uniform divorce law. which has been talked of so much over the states is devised and it will not be long un til such a law will be upon our statute books. Nothing is said about the rate bill, pure food law. or meat inspection bills, which bills were passed by con gress last spring, although the presi dent is in favor of amending the meat inpsection law so that packers should place dates upon all labels. The President is greatly in favor" of aiding and encouraging the develop ment of American shipping. Currency reform is advocated but no special plan is suggested. The withdrawal of the provisional govern ment in Cuba is recommended as soon as an election can be held and a stable government installed. He pro' claims war as honorable, but that peace is desirable and that the main tenance of a good army and navy is Burest guarantee of peace. Numerous other topics are touched upon in the message and it will pay every good citizen to read this vol uminous message in full. 

SHALL WE HAVE CHAUTAUQUA It has been often suggested that Denison should hold chautauquas and seems to be no reason why we should not. Denison is a beautiful town in the summer, we have a large popula tion. we have many people in Deni son and vicinity who would like to attend a good chautauqua. When the new hotel is completed we will be in condition to accomodate the large number of people coming from out of town to attend the chautauqua and we also have such good railroad facilities that people can come and attend the entertainments at any time and conveniently return home. San City, Jefferson and Missouri Valley have successfuly conducted these chautauquas which have proven them selves beneficial and instructive and at the same time have greatly adver tised the towns. Denison is a live, up-to-date town and should come to the front and give these summer en tertainments, for there is no reason why we cannot make possible what Sac City, Jefferson and Missouri Val ley can do. Chautauquas furnish a variety of different lectures and everybody at tends a lecture to their liking. Many elements contribute to make a chautauqua a success—first of all it presents something to please every body. One wants a humorous lecture and he gets it. Others want travel talks and they get them beautifully illustrated and presented by wide awake. up-to-date newspaper war correspondent?, who willingly risk their lives on the firing line to be near where thirds happen and get the facts. Others want music and they get lots of it, from the classic strains of the Orchestra to the ever popular plantation melodies of the colored Jubilee folks. Others like the fun and frolic of the moving pic tures, and they are furnished plenty of it along with the thrillning scenes of war, earthquake, automobile races, etc. Yet one of the greatest factors of 9 Chautauqua is the meeting of old friends and neighbors, the renewal of old friendships, the latest news of Cousin Bill and his new wife from way out west. During the month of December Mr. Schlumberger will again present all his old and new customers with a cal endar and weather chart combined for 1907. Call at Schlumberger's Phar macy. mi# «r.f 4* Carelessness is largely responsible for the yearly sacrifice of human life. The other day two vessels on the Pacific coast collided through the carelessness of one of the wheelsmen and one boat sank with forty lives few days before two trains crashed into each other and sixty poor creat ures were offered as a burnt sacrifice to somebody's carelessness. And so it goes on day after day through the year. Is it that human life is so cheap? We believe that the American peo pleas a whole were never more hon est in their business dealings than they are today, yet it is evident that in certain circles embezzlement is usually prevalent. The Massachusetts Cummissioner of Banking, as the re suit of his investigations, says that there is an average of one new case of embezzlement for every day 'in the year. This is a startling com mentary upon that mad haste to get rich which lures so many into wild speculation and ultimate ruin, and to the fast life which others fol low with the same miserable ending. The power of sympathy and the effect of a wise appeal to their bet ter side, in the effort to win way ward boys and young men to honest and useful lives are well seen in the work accomplished by Judge Lindsey in the Juvenile Court at Denver. The old method of dealing with first offenders resulted in making them hardened criminals, for"• it was harsh, stupid, and punitive only. The new method, with it* sympathetic tact and common sense treatment, is saving thousands of young people who under the old system, were it now in operation, would become a curse to society. President Roosevelt has visited foreign country and thereby 1: broken the rule observed by his pre decessors. Still nothing happened. The sun did not stand still in silent amazement at so rafeh a deed, nor was there any convulsion of nature. It may or may not be a wise thing for a president to leave the bounds of his country, but if the only objec tion to his so doing is the fact that no former president ever did it then it may be that President Roosevelt's action was an instance of a custom being "more honored in the breach than in' the observance..'' It is pos sible to become hide-bound by pre drawback in may well cedent. That is 'one old-world countries guard against. we Some of the society women of New York have an uneviable faculty of saying and doing foolish things. Must certainly Mrs. Herbert Parsons trans gresses the bounds of decency and rationality in her book, "The Fam ily.'' Her plea for experimental marriages and free divorce causes the moral sense to revolt. Society and family life are disorganized too much already. What is needed something that will put society on more wholesome basis and strength en the family relation, on something to further undermine them. Mrs Parsons' so-called remedy would only make the disease worse. The lot of the poor children born of the union she advocates would be pitiable in the extreme. A Safe and Sure Cough Cure.
