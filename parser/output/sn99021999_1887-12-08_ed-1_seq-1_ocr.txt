It was quietly whispeted mound the hotel roiiidors and the eapitol to-diij that Mr. Hlaino had cabled to Stephen H. nikins his jrcfoiment as to the place w lie ) o the next icpublican nominating con- \ention should be held , and that Mr. Klkins would conliol it. As slated in a Hi n special last night , a majoiity ot thu national com mittee favor the lenomlnatlon of Mr. Hlaine. Pennsylvania is the stionghold of the plumed knight , and as soon as this repoit bciamo well ciiculated , the delegation from Phila delphia was obsei veil to go into their \voik with icnewcd vigor , and to-night they aie claiming that thc.y will get the convention. The light at piesent Is tiinngtilar , the tinee points standing out mo st boldly * for the convention being Phila delphia , Cluiago and Cincinnati , With chances of .success In the order named. Theio is strong talk of a combination nganibt Chicago. The south and states cast of Indiana , prefer Philadel phia to Chicago while some of the far yvcst- ei n states piefer the Quaker city to the city b.v the hike In the stiugglo the Omaha dele gation have sluing hopes of success bi com ing in as a dai Ic ho. se or a compromise. Min neapolis is making almost as much clamoi as Cincinnati , but St Louis docs not seem to llguic very pioimncutly. A Philadolphiiiii sajsofthe advantages of his city : "The convention will not go to Cincinnati , because Hlaine would not bu given a fan-chanco thoiu ; it would bo for bheiman the veiy air of the place. At Chicago theie aio similar objections. One of Chicrgo's gieat news- p ipcis has a man in KuiopohouiicRiii ; Hlaine , and mi'iicpiesentmg him , while two or thieo otheis uiu going lor him with ham liter and tongs in their editorial columns.

" The Nebiaska hcadip-Uirteis weie tonight tinonged with visitors. The ciowd seemed to be gi eater and moiu enthusiastic than last nlkht , when Senator Culloni , of Illinois ; Mayor Smith , of Cincinnati , and other pi emi nent men came in. In the event of a pooling of Issues upon a dark horse , it is believed that Cincinnati , St. Louis and Minneapoln will come to Omaha. Ohio would not go to Philadelphia , since that city is spoken of as a favoiitulor Hlaino men. The ciowd at the Aillugton hotel thin evening was laigcr than any night pievious duimg the week. All the delegations yvho are contending for the ne.xt national conven tion have their headquaiteis in that hotel and documents bearing upon the facilities of- feiedb.v each ol the cities lie aiound on all yio tables and staio at the tiaveler fiom neaily overj door.

Long John Jones , of Chicago , ex- pi esses thu opinion that Mr. Hlaino's h tends , thiongli Mr Ijlkins , would dctcimhio the matter and that fuithor aitlvc u oik for the ! convention bi the Chicago delegation wouhl be unnecessary.

While New Yoik Is making no move in the interest of any candi date In that state , so far as could bo ascer tained at piesent Writing , u prominent fiiend of Mr. Hlamu's stated this evening that il Hlainc can bo induced to tun , the best Judg meat ot Ids friends in thu convention will indicate dicato thu selection of Hen Han ison of In diana , as the vice presidential candidate It is admitted by the filends of Mr. Hlaini that the election of New Yoik haspiactic all.v decided the political complexion of thai state in Ibsb and that the pimcipal cffOits ol the partj must bo utado to capture the olec. toral vote of New Jeisey , Connecticut am Indiana Some holies have been raised ii the breasts of the extiemo piotectionlsts by the vigoious taiiff icfoim message of Piesi dent Cleveland widen , it is hoped , will piovi a inoio potent factor in securing the votes ol mechanics and artisans than General Han cook's.

KISSAXE'S CASK s llpcorclcr Sinytho Nolle Proves tlio Celebrated Suit. Nrvv UIK , Dec. 7. [ Special Telegram to the UiK.l The last chapter in the celebrated and novel case of William Kissane , the Cali- fontia millionaire forger and llllibusteicr , has been biought ton close. Thorecoidof his daring criminal exploits has been consigned to oblivion , from which seven months ago it was taken mid spieud before the public. He is now fieo to return to New York , from which ho fled over thirty years ago to escape trial on the charge of foigeiy. Since then the catccr of William Kissanc bus been more like a romance than real life. A fugitiAO from Justice , ho never once came within the jurisdiction of the state. Now , however , all baniers have been lemoved and ho is free to eomo or go at his will. This was accomplished to-day , rioin u pigeon-hole of the district attorney's ofllco the indict ment a musty , faded sheet of paper was taken. It was handed to Re- colder Smjthe , who examined it closely , then , scbing his pen , ho wrote a few words which lobbed the document of all tenor for the California millionaire. The ink with which the incictincnt Is wnttcn has almost faded with 'age. but it is sufllciently distinct to show that William Kissano was aijested , clurgcd with the crime of forging u i heck on the Chemical National bank ; that ho was tiled for the oftMiiso May tti ! , IN" , and that the jury disagiccu ; that ho was tried again June 1 ! ) of the same jear , when n Juror was withdrawn , and that his council made application to the i on it to have the case lomanded to the couit of oyer and and terminer , and that In the following week the application was gi anted Until to-day no further action was taken. According to the piesent ciiminal law -no nollu piosequl can bo enteicd. it must bo dismissed , but under the law existing at the time the forgery "was committed such piocecding could take place and under the old law Kissano has been released. A nolle piosequl has been enti'ied. Nine months ago , when the case came up on apjilli atlon of Kcssano's counsel , the iccoider was in favor of dis missing the charge. The proceedings , how ever , had been iiTcguhuh earned on , hence gho delay. To-day ho decided that it was time the e'nso should bo ended and accord ing , under his own hand , ho wioto the fol lowing on the back of the dusty indictment "Tho district attorney states that ho can not procure the evidence of witnesses to maintain this indictment and that the ends of Justice would not be hccuredby moving the ti ial thereof Tor these i easons and for the fuither i.eason that the indictment was found the j ears ago , the motion of the district at torney for leave to enter a nolle proscqui as against defendant Klssuno Is granted.
