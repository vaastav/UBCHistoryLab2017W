CURTIS, LAWMAKERS GATHERING IX THKjin NATIONAL CAPITAL Final Session of Sixty-First Congress to Ojm'ii Next Monday—Republi can Majority in Lower House to Enjoy a Brief Reign— New Fares in the Sen ate Chami>er Washington, D. C., Dec.2.—With the opening of the final sesseion of the Sixty-first congress but two days away, senators and representatives from near and far are arriving in Washington today on every train. Following custom, both houses will adjourn soon after their convening at noon ott Monday out of respect to the memory of those members who have died during the recess of con gress, Five senators and three repre sentatives have died since the begin ning of summer. The vacancy caused by the death of Senator Daniel of Virginia has been filled by the ap pointment of ex-Governor Swanson. Senator Percy was chosen to succeed to the seat of the late Senator Mc Laurin of Mississippi. Governor Sanders of Louisiana was elected to succeed the late Senator McEnery, but he later decided to retain the govern orship and appointed Judge J. R. Thornton to the senatorship. Some question was raised as to the validity of this procedure and the Louisiana legislature is now in special session to settle the matter. Lafayette Youngof Des Moines has been ap pointed by Governor Carroll of Iowa to fill out the unexpired term of the late Senator Dolliver. Former Gover nor Terrell of Georgia has likewise be 6 n appointed to fill out the term of the late Senator Clay. The deceased representatives are Samuel L. Glismore of Louisiana. Charles Q. Tirrell of Massachusetts, and Walter C. Brownlow of Tennes see. Their successors were chosen at. the regular elections last month. Tuesday is likely to be devoted in both houses to reading of President Taft's annual message to congress, and after that the lawmakers should be able to get down to business al most immediately, as the details of organization and committee changes v/ill require little time. The opinion is gaining ground that little else than the passage of the various appropria tion bills will be attempted. In the senate the session will be re markable only in that it will mark the farewell appearance of many members who for years have been leaders or familiar figures in the up per house. Chief among these are Sen ators Aldrich of Rhode Island and Male of Maine, two of the oldest members of the upper house in point of service and for many years among the most cospicuous leaders in that )ody. Both announced early last summer their intentions to retire from the senate at the expiration of their present terms. Another of the "old guard" whose career in the senate will end with the session about to begin is Senator Bur rows of Michigan, who was defeated in the primaries by Representative Townsend. The genial Senator De peW of New York will also appear for the last time as a member, the elec tion of a Democratic legislature in the Empire State having sealed his fate. Senator Beveridge of Indiana will pass out and will be succeeded next March by John W. Kern, the Democratic vice presidential candi date two years ago. Warner of Mis souri, Dick of Ohio and Kean of New Jersey are the other conspicuous members of the senate who will pass out with the end of the sixty-first congress. The leaders and old timers of the house who will close up their official careers as members at this session are almost too numerous to mention. Many of the prominent members of the Republican side were slaughtered in the primaries, chiefly as a result of the rising tide of "insurgency," and to these were added many more who were buried beneath the Demo cratic landslide in November.

Sperry, of the Second Connecticut district, the oldest mem ber of the house in point of years, is retiring voluntarily at the end of this session. He is eighty-three years old. But the "father of the house" in point of service, General H. H. Bingham of the First Pennsylvania district conies back smilingly, having been numbered among the victors at the November election. Genera! Bingham has served continuously in congress since the forty-sixth session, a period of over thirty years.
