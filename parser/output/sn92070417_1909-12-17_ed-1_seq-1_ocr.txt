Two sons are said to have been born from this union and both survives. The elder, Lucien, five years old, it is reported will claim the throne. Prince Albert, the heir presumtive, is a nephey of King Leopold II, the dead monarch. The Rockefeller of Royalty. There was no ruler more in the public eye than King Leopold II, of Belgium. Whether considered in the light of his loves or his financial deals, hia record was an amaziog hu man document He did not preach like Emperor William, he did not hide like the Emperor of Austria, he did not make peace like King Edward of England. But during his ?elga he made Brussels next to Paris in beau ty and helped to make his little king dom the garden spot of the world. Leopold was the Rockefeller of royalty and had the reputation of heine the sharpest business man in Europe. He was exceptionally strong in linguistic attainments; and like a Roman of old, he never allowed an insult to nass unavenged or a ben efit to go unrequitted. He ruled with . f nvar nna million SdUare B i miles In the'' Congo, because he be lieved that Abe black man could not be governed by gentle means. King Leopold was born April 9, 1835, and had served as ruler of the Belgiums since 1865. He married in 1853, Marie Henriette, a daughter 01 Archduke Joseph .of Austria, and ascended the throne on the death of his. father, King Leopold I, Decem ber 10, 1865. In 1876 he effected at Brussels the organization' of the, Afri can International association with a view to making use of the discoveries in Africa. A shrewd and enterpris ing man of business, he promoted this work with great energy, furnishing the means, largely from his own re sources, for Stanley's exploration of the Congo. The Cong Free State was established and neutralized and the sovereignty of it was given to Leopold by the Berlin conference in 1885. His only eon, Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, and Count pf Hain ault, died in 1869. Queen Marie Henri ette died September 19, 1902, and King Leopold In recent years married the Countess de, Vaughan, who was his morganatic wife.

H. Stapp, and made a complete confession. . The boy said that he fired the shot which killed Menssor and furthermore ad mitted that his father, Catalino Torres was . nearby at the time of the tra gedy, although he denied that the el der Torrea, had a hand in- the killing However, the fact that the boy's fath er waa a witness to the murder make's him liable as aa. aocesory. ,.

The sher iff spent two days at Gonzales Inves tigating the murder of Seraplo Men zor and s when he reached home last night he had enough . circumstantial evidence against the Torres', father and son, to convince him that either one, or both of them, were the slayers of the ranchman. Today's confession proves that Sheriff Romero was not mistaken. According to the facta unearthed by Sheriff Romero, Menzor was killed between the hours of 10 and 11 o'clock last Sunday morning about a mile and a half from hia ranch home near Gonzales, a remote settlement in northeastern San Miguel county. The body was found about twenty four hours later by one of the dead man's sons, who, when her father did not return, went out to look for him. . ' While the officers would not give out the details of the younger Torres' confession, it Is said that the boy related how he had had trouble previously with Menzor and that he and his father, went to the Menzor ranch Sunday morning to "have It out" With Menzor. Ho was found in specting a bunch of sheep grazing some distance from the ranch house. Ho was evidently taken unawares and 'shot down by the Torres boy, as in his confession young Torres' Is said t6 have told how, after Merixbr had expired, his father, who -was an eye witness to the killing, took from the dead man's body a belt of, cartridges and a revolver and hid It In a rocky crevice nearby". "Sheriff 'Romero will return to the sceiie i of ' tb! crime as soon as tho snow melts and look for this weapon and belt According to Sheriff Romero, the ball which killed Menzor literally tore the top of his head oflV having (Continued on Page 4) DISASTROUS WRECKS ON SANTA FE CHICAGO LIMITED CRASHES INTO OVERLAND PASSENGER NO. 8 ONE HILLED; 35 INJURED ACCIDENT DUE TO FLAGMAN'8 FAILURE ,TO "STOP ' FLYER GOAL TRAIN IN DITCH BAD DERAILMENT BETWEEN HERE AND ALBUQUERQUE " BLOCKS TRAFFIC , " Flagstaff, Ariz., Dec. 17.
