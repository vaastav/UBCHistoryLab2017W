P"~ 4^- A*&jy5$jp r VOLUME 13, NO. 294. County Commissioner pendent School District $10,000 for School Ho ^fckrtb ^r\ "sv^s^fPS&o&Bi Bagley, Minn., Dec. 8.At a meet ing of the board of county commis sioners late yesterday afternoon it was decided to exchange with the In dependent School District No. 2, the present court house block for the school house and to pay an additional consideration of $10,000. The coun ty will use the school house as a court house. Votes $45,000 for School. The school district recently voted $45,000 in bonds to be used for the construction of a new school house as the district has outgrown its pres ent location. Under the plan sub mitted to the school district by the county commissioners the district will be able to expend $55,000 on a new school building and will have a site. The county in turn will have an excellent building to be used as a court house Has No Court House. When Clearwater county was set off from Beltrami county there were no funds available for the construc tion of a court house. Mr. White, of the White & Streeter Townsite com pany of Bagley, donated to the county a block in the village of Bagley to be used for a court house. The vil lage of Bagley then donated the city hall building and the citizens by do nations had the building moved to the court house block The building has ever since 1903 been used as a court house. Is Two-story Structure. It is a two-story frame structure. On the first floor are located the county auditor, treasurer, register of deeds and clerk of court offices On the second floor is the court room, a small room to be used as the judge's chamber and another small room for the jury. The sheriff, county attor ney, superintendent "of schools, sur veyor and judge of probate have not been able to find room in the present building so offices have been secured in several buildings away from the court house. The room on the sec ond floor of the present court house that is supposed to be the jury room is so constructed that there is no de gree of secrecy and deputy sheriffs have had to be stationed to keep the public from getting too near the walls of the room to hear what was going on inside. Rooms have had to be rented down town to be used for both the grand and petit jury No Vault Space. When court is not in session the judge of probate has used the court rooms But he has had no vault and many of the valuable records of his office have been exposed to loss by fire. The county surveyor has been using the jury room but as there has been no vault provided the records of his office are at the mercy of a fire No- Heating Plant. The present court house building has no heating plant, except stoves, which makes the danger of fire great. Only two vaults are in the present building, one constructed on the out side. There is a great deal of county property and valuable papers that cannot be placed in these vaults and fire would destroy everything, caus ing a large loss It would be impos sible to replace a large portion of the records, Only One Stairway. The present court house building has only one stairway leading to the court room and if a fire would burn the stairway it would endanged the lives of many, were the court in ses sion. The people of the county have realized for some time the need of a new building to properly and ade quately house the county officers and their records. Owing to the fact that Independent School District. No. 3 has outgrown its present school building, it has become necessary for it tp secure a new school building The present build ing was constructed when material was cheaper than it now is. The county commissioners have made the suggestion of exchanging the present school house building and grounds for the court house block and $10,- 000. The location of the school property and the court house square are such that there is no advantage to either by reason of location. Easy to Improve. The school house is so constructed as will be easy to rearrange the rooms and provide adequate vault space and very convenient offices for all the county officers. The school building is practically new and the condition tki&C .ib&ifi ^l^SSF ^tJ?- Clearwater County To 'M CourtHouseBuilding *r Inde- and $45,000 TO BE 

EXPENDED FOR SCHOOL Present Building at County Seat is Owned by Village of Bagley is Inadequate. TH^ E BEMIDM is to be ascertained for the county by a resident of Clearwater county and a resident of some other county. The school building is constructed of brick and looks more like a court house than it does a school building. Total Cost Small. It is estimated that the necessary changes would cost less than $4,000 and that when the changes are made the county would have a splendid court house adequate for all purposes and not to exceed the cost of $14,- 000. That the exchange to be made is wise from an economic standpoint is evident. To construct a building that would provide the same space and in way proper would cost more than twice as much as it would cost the county to make the exchange. By making the change the county will also avoid the usual long delay that would be had if a new building were to be constructed. The building that is used as the court house at present is owned by the village of Bagley. The school district will vote on the exchange in the near future. 

DEMAND FOR MONEY LI6HT, SAYS BANK Notwithstanding the revival of industry and trade which has been clearly under way for several months, there has been practically no increase in the commercial demand for money, according to the monthly letter issued today by the Security State bank of Bemidji. The letter in referring to the money market is as follows: "Every part of the country seems to be not only well supplied with money for its own needs, but able to share some for employment out side. This is noticeably the case with such cities as Kansas City, St. Paul and Minneapolis, where in other years when big crops were to be handled money from the East was wanted. The most plausible explan ation seems to be that the crops of 1914 brought a large amount of money to the grain and live stock districts, that the check given by the war 4 ew tmdertsltrnssr has cattsed money to accumulate and that the trade revival has not been going long enough to exhaust the accumulations and send the industries to the money market.

Medals to Be Given. Prizes will be offered both for the school which sends the winning rep resentative and for the winner him self. A silver loving cup will be awarded annually to the school that wins, thus making it an annual af fair. Medals will be awarded to every student who takes part in the finals. Eight Minutes to Talk. Professor Glen Clark of Macalester, in organizing the contest, decided that in order to make it as easy for the contestants as possible, instead of having a debating contest which would make it necessary for the teams to change sides for the finals* a discussion contest would be more satisfactory. Each speaker will be given eight minutes for a construc tive speech and three minutes for re buttal. The subject of this year's contest is, "Shall the United States materially increase her naval and military armament?" The speakers can take any phase of the question they care to. Contest in January. The Bemidji contest is already in the process of organization, although it will not be held until some time in January. Pamphlets and articles are being massed to provide good ma terial for the local representative. It is undecided whether the contest here will be a senior-junior affair or whether the whole school will be per mitted to choose a speaker, one from each class. COUNTY POULTRY. 1 ASSN.
