Dear Courier: A inn to Walhalla and bock is no pleasant trip, notwithstanding tho com fort und conveniences obluicod on tho Creon ville Railroad. This road is in good condition and makes good timo, nt least BO far as is con sistent with safely, and wo prefer to praiso a sate to a breakneck gait. Tho condition and management of thc road reflects thc highest credit on its managers, but Ibero is ono thing lacking. Tho froight and passenger rates arc ruinously high. Tho bitter impedes travel and diminishes tho earnings of tho road, ut thc sacrifico of tho intcicsts of thc people. Thc former drinks up the hard earnings of the fur nier and discourages production. Tho policy is suicidal. Wo uro satisfied, that with a re duction of rates, tho amount of froight and travel Would double the earnings of thc road in a few years. Political economy abounds with illustrations of Ibis fact in matters of na tional revenue, and not a singlo lustnncoonn bo pointed out, where n decrease of tho tax on a particular article, bas not resulted in such an increase-in its production as to enhance tho gross iucomofroui it. Such, wo are sure, would be true of freights likewise. Freights may become so high as to condorn product worthless, all its value in market, hoingconsumed in thc transportation, and in fact b-gji ,;xje3 l,j.vftV? tend to diminish pr^Juctlou. %'{<> evi]' \v0 lear can bo caused on 1;; 'uy competition' In fl ?f 01 ;''comVolition bas run so Ililli that ?ifs,, class iroights were charged at 25 cents Por Viumlrod from Now York to Ohioago, a die Vance of 1,000 milos.
