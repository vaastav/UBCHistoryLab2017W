CHARLESTON, Va., Dec. 7, 1861. Ir.AK C'HBONfcLi: The excellent bsnd of the 7lh Ohio Regiment has just been dis coursing some ueiighltul airs u.iUcr our window, and somehow the memories evolved hy the munic were'tif borne, and said 1 to my companion I will writeto the CiiiutNK'l.c, for souie few of iu readers may be interested in what we cuu tell them of this place, and our army in this valley. 1'aid a flying visit to Gantry ftridge, few days ago, but with the exception of a very large increase in the quuutity of mud, and the movement therefrom of troops. everything is much as it was at the time of our Iftft visit. The trip served to remind me, however, of the fact that I was led into innking a fulae prophecy, iu my letter fron Gnuley.in reference to the capture of Floyd's army. 1 cnn only apologize by saying that I thought he would be takenand officers of the army hereabouts say that he might and should have been, if movements in that direction hud been prompt. Hut 1 presume the facts will transpire beloro a Court Mar tial soon to bo convened. Although transportation for Government stores by land is needed but for five miles from tho lunding to Oauley Bridge, yet the rosd tor that short distance is most villani ously had in fact next to impaible. The loss of Government property over thnt road during the psst and succeeding two months would fur more than pay for an excellent "macadamized" road, and would nearly suffice to construct a railroad. ISut nothing hns been done in that direction, snd the re sult is appurvnt in the dead horses, broken and abandoned wagons, and daniagod and Inst stores which line the roadside. Since my foruier visit to this valley Gun. Hoscrrans' has left his quarters at Camp Tompkins Farm, and gone to Wheeling Gen. Cox has tuken up his quarters here, and the different, regiments in this division have been considerably shifted nhoutj the 1st and 2d Ky., and 7th Ohio being in camp here, and the 11th Ohio at Point Plaasaut For the present your correspondent will be stationed here, where, thanks to the kind ness of Oen. Cox, we are quartered in the office of Geo. W. Summers, Esq. Several regiments are stationed at Fuycttevillo, and others have taken the places of those moved from Gauley. Thero scorns but littlo prospect for any active operations for the army of the Kan awha at present, but Gen. Cox is disposed to improve the time thus afforded them, as Ooneral Order So. 33, just issued culls the attention of all tho ofljoere and troops "to the necessity of using the present oppor tunity to improve in military knowledge and dUciiiliun," and he "expects hearty eo-npo-rutiou from all in securing to desirable a result." - Notwithstanding the fact that General Rosecruns baa left the Kanawha valley, and Gen. llenhsm is under arrest,, the loyal citixons of the North need have no fears bnt all will be well here under the eye of Gen. Cox. IIo, with his gallant brigade, con quered tho vulloy, and took possession of oil the territory we now bold hore, and ha is able to keop it, and will keep it. Tbo town of Charleston has in itself noth ing remarkable, unless it be an excess of "niggors" and mud the latter of uniform depth and oonsiitoncy all over town, but the former with all those interesting shades of color so pcouhar to slave breeding neighbor hoods.' In- the social oirolos "seoesh" reigns supremo, particularly among thegontlersex, and hitter maledictions are hurlod at the Uuiouists, in a quiet way, whenever an op portunity offers. They huvc quit looking for Wis to return, though I am told that for long time after the arrival of our troops, thu diauiuhis at saeessia kapt sumptuous Toasts in VJr housain anticipation of the advent af the rebel army. Poor fools, the child is not yet born which will witness the triumphant entry of a rebel army into this town, or even Into the valley, and a feast, even though of army crackers and red herring, (not very iashionubl article) will have tuoulderod long before the "unroturn ing brave (?)" return. The 7th Ohio Regiment are under march ing orders to join Gen. Kolley's command at Grafton, and will leave here as soon as transportation can be procured, which will be in a day ot two. I cannot close this letter without contri buting my uiito of praise to Gen. Cox, for the admirable manner in whioh be has acquit ted himself in his 'campaign in this valley While he was in command of tbe Depart ment of the Kanawha he marched up tbe valley with bis jrallant .''little brigade," aqd the miserable braggadocio, Wise, fled before him, nntil the valley from Point Pleasant to Gauley Bridge was freod from the traitor's presence. While he has not boon entirely free from the attacks of jealous rivals, he has moved in his sphere and transacted his business so quietly, that malioe is powerless as against him. I am reminded of Pope's epitaph on Sir VY m. Truuibull as peculiarly applicable to Gen. C. : "Aplaaaiiiikirai s Ins, yairauiUumiudi fcinaxra, llmiigli prudanli aoiialailCvrl maiaiiadi llomir uucliaiijad. a pnnoila rot'tand, lll'd to ana nda, bul inodaral lo lha raatl t'illad wUS lha acuta ol aira. lha Sra ut yih, , A tontn of wraiwluif. yal a saaj for urns l A aauarotu lalia Irian auparaUUua (na A tos Ut tiasca, anil Sala u4 lyruiuiy." When the history of the eaniDaiun in Western Virginia is written, the unbiassed historian must accord to Oen.

Our corrtsnotident's letter, which IS frrntifviiiirlv coninlete. shows moat wiiinlii- sively that the most serious casualty on our side was that resulting from the explosion of a shell at Fort Pickr-ns alter the bom bardment, hy means of which five men were killed and two wounded. Off Fort Pickens, Nov. 22, 1861, 8 P. M. On Wednesday, the 20th, (duy before yesterday) it beeamo pretty generally well annwn among u mat t tie Mag olhccr had made up bis mind to commence thu bombard niont of l'enacoln. movidimr that t'lilmiei Brown was ready, snd as wo knew thut the Colonel only wailed lor the Flsa's action we felt pretty certain that the bull would be opened at once. 1 need not tell you that sal s hands were up to "concert pitch," and as eager to commence as you at the .North have been anxious to have us, find although we icit sure mat some formidable masked but teries would disolose themselves, we wore ready to find out where they were, ulul try tneenectsot our ll-inob guns in silencing them. lltrotgect axis btilctlniy tlm Xari Yartlm lis in put a Hop m their une of (Joeirnmeiit prnprrty ana iihiIm in building nny more ex tensive means of defense, and to hatter down some of their fortifications. Order.) were given to our engineers to place bags filled with cool around such portions of the machinery as wore exnosed to shot, ami nearly all the work was done which is ne ccisury to "prepare ship for action." Early yesterday morning the flag officer went on snore UnmiHer with Colonel brown in regard to preliminaries. At twelve o' clock he returned, and then wo received or der to complete all necessary arrangements. Orders were dispatched to the "Richmond" nu .'lonrgoiuery, men in port, givins them directions how to net, and the word wns nassed thnt we should mora in t rlnv. light, so as to engage Fort McKea, and the and battery, jut in front of Fort Mellon, all three of which could bring their guns to benr upon eithor Fort Pickens or the ship ping. . ....... 

OPENING OF THE ENGAGEMENT. By sunrise this morning wo were all ready. Our bouts hsd been hoisted out and moored alongside, shot and shell got up, and steam all ready to move in at short notice. The usual moruinff uraver was offurerl cliutilain implored a blessing noon the events oi me uuy; auor wnicn tnu lMag-Jlhccr ad dressed a fi-w words to the men in his nsual clear, uuick. cmne-to-thn-noini. n ,,Af Ho urged upon them "strict nliedinnce to all ordersj coolness, judgment and precision in firing. ' The answer was throe hearty cheers. About hulf-pust 9 we could see the steam er coming down to the Navy Yard, little suspecting that their doom was sealed. In u very short time they were fast to the dock, and at just twelve minute of ten we saw a smuko issue forth from Fort Piokons, and heard tlw boominir of the nun A burst forth from our men, and if cvoraship's uiivnui uumu up iivmy ll rnu ours tnen. While working our way in, the Richmond ornno up under our storn. and, as she draws less waler than we do, tho Commodore or dered her to go in and open firo a soon as sue win within range. Nie paved by us, tisik a position nearer to the laud and open ed firo. .Meantime, tbo water butterv and rort .UcHeu wcio doimr their best to (light en us, by throwing shot that toll about u mile short. We kept on steully until we thought that wo wore within range and then tamo to alienor. THE ACTION. Niagara, togother with the guns, bousing Irom ort Pickens and Hmtoiv Scott, were nil pwymg into fort McKea and itssnrrouiid ing b.ttterins. We avcrmred one shell i-vm v ton minutes, and as tho Richmond had morn guns, though smaller, and mnio than our number of guns were being served from sunta koso, there was about twonhulls each minute, being fin d at this point. Aliout one o clock a fi froin a masked battery whioh disclosed itsolf in ins wooas along tno shore, and about a milo south of MoRea. They aoemoj to nave a particular spite against us, by the pertinacity with which they fifed at us j but finding that they could not reach us, thev turned their attentinn to tho Richmond, which was nearor in shdre. Many of their snot came very close to the latter, and bad moy mien wou-uirecteu would have done a great deal of damage. Only one took effect. however, and I regrot to record that this killed one man and wounded seven. The man killed was captain of tho gun, and was in mo on or losing aim when struck. The wounded were hut slivlulv hurt About throo o'clock, ono or two shot passect over us and dropped into the water, and by tho note which they san; as they passed, we know that they had turned some heavier metal upon ns. Two or three of our guna were direotod to the spot whenoe the smoke was seen to issue, and if they treated ua lo musio, we returned the compli ment with interest They succeeded in p'-int-ing two shots in our sides; making rather ugly ?, uMooiuiiif iiungsin one ol the lieutenant a rooms. By aix o'clock We must have dtsmrmmed the gun, Tor ut that time MoRea ceased firing altogether, and for one pour anu a nau we tumbled shell after shell inside of her walls without snv laanniiM After we bad become well engaged in the fight we hardlv thought of or had time to look at ort Pickens. Onee in a while I wouiuoasia glance that way, and 1 could see that the semi-oil ole of batteries around br were keeping up a constant explosion of shell over her loyal walls; while from ont her aides there cams a stanriv umm r white smoke, and I could see that the shots took good effect. Wt had already made two good holes in Fort MoRea, and' Pickens had kuookod a hole that a horso and cart might enter in. A despatch has lust anm fVnm Pninnl Brown, in whioh he says "he has only one killed and two wounded," and that he "has not yet fairly oommoneed." Tha AW ! from the iort disabled the steamer "Time." Colonel Brown thinks that Fort MoRea is effectually silenced. THE SECOND DAY OF THE FIGHT. Saturday. Not. 23 7:30 P. M A. T eonunenoa to write to night, the whorsby i illuminated by the burning of'tho twn of Warrington and the Navy Yard. The lormer nas oumea since 3 J . M., but the latter haa lust taken fire. The aiirht la ,.! sublime, anything you ohnose to call it, only wa are too ursa to iook at It, The forte and firing. Fort batteries have just ceased ' Pickens must have fired over 1,000 shot and shell to-day. At 9: so signals were made to Fort Pickens, and at 10 we weighed anchor and stoamed in neany to our position. l ha Richmond did not go in at all, as tha flag officer did not think (her shot took sufficient effect to pay for being badly cut up. As soon as we approsohed, the new battery in tbe wood aisciosea risen, and although it burst shell nonr Us, it could not do us much harm. The Other latfArv in tlia amrtfl tin rvinaiata twu,picr-4 Fort Pickens opened fire a little afW in.t We same to anchor at 10.40, and Broil the flrst gnn at 10.45. . At this time all tho i batteries were hard at work. There were between forty and fifty guns playing into Fort Pickens. As we expected, masked batteries had disoloscd themselves all along the beach. THE REBEL FORTIFICATIONS. During Saturday and Sunday nights we could sec the camp fires of two or three par ties on shore, who are doubtless engaged in erecting batteries lor our reception, but I do not think it is the Commodore's inten tion to engage them. They have strewed their fortifications all along tbe beach, and contain only one or two guns in each, and at the samo time they are protected by the woods. To silence such fellows, it is neces sary to have a ship for each one. and even then I doubt if it could bo accomplished. It ivipiims a landing party, and a force suf ficient to take possession of the whole place. THE RESULT. T question wbeth ir Col. Brown will at tempt to do much more. Hr.hu rffectrj hi purjmm- that of destroying the winter quarters if the- rebels, and although thy sitneeeilejai pitting out the firo in life Navy Buisi, lie has shown thorn that, it will bea very unsafe operation to commence work there again, a he cm and will sot fire to it if they make the attempt. A sad accident happened at Fort Pickens this morning. As some of tlm men weio removing tho fuses irnd eniptyinir the pow der from the shells that fell inside the fort and did not explode, a spark of firo from the chisel used in removing the fuse, caused one of tho shells to explode, killing five men and wounding two.

The fleet bod pre viously been sent to Fort Pickens, with two companies of artillery, for the purpose of rc-eiiroroing tne iort when so ordered, and the dispatches carried hy Mr. Worden con veyed orders to that effcot. Lieut. Worden arrived at Pensacola by way of Richmond and Montgomery on the 11th, hsvinir com muted the dispatches to memory, and torn thom up for fear of arrest and search, owing to the excited state ol tlm country. At Peusucola he obtained an interview with Gen. Bruin, the rebel cniiniinnilnr. nml nV. tainod a pass to visit Capt.
