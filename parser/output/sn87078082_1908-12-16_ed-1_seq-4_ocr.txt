Tun Supreme Court, of the State of Indiana has decided Hint where a pub lisher continues to send a newspaper or a magazine to a subscriber longer than the time contracted for, or over one year without a renewal of contract, the subscriber is under no obligation to pay for more than' the time contracted for, and, in case of no contract, only for one year. State Health Commissionkk Dixon issued an urgent warning last week against the increased danger of typhoid fever that he declared must certainly follow a period of heavy rain, saying, "Boil all water. Heavy rains following the long drought that we have had, will wash into the streams any accumulated filth along the watersheds. This must necessarily increase the danger from pol luted drinking water, especially where the water is not effectually filtered Therefore the people should be on the closest guard against typhoid fever and boil the water used for drinking and other domestic purposes." The writer who said that no news paper which took truth for its standard would make a pecuniary success was not far from right. The press might te turn the compliment, however, by re marking that no minister who told the truth about his congregation alive or dead, would occupy the pulpit much long er than on the Sunday afterward. The press and clergy go hand in hand with the charitable whitewash brush, wear ing rosy spectacles, magnifying little virtues, and kindly throwing little de formities into oblivion. The pulpit, the pen and the gravestone are partners ii: Saint making. The second or short session of the Six' tieth Congress is now being held. There isn't much expected of it. There will be some discussion of tariff revision; postal savings banks will be considered, with some opposition nnd there will be an ef fort to make provision for the next cen rus. It is doubtful if Congress pays much attention to President Hooscvelt's recommendations in his message. The most important question before Congress is how to run the government on the pres entrevenucs. Thedemandsarelargeand growing larger. If the legislators had any idea of economy rnd practiced it for a while there would be no deficit; but that is too much to expect. It costs something to dispose of dead Chinese dignitaries. On Thursday last accompanied by a procession of six thousand mourners and four thousand soldiers, the body of the late Emperor Kwungsu was carried from the Forbid den City to the Coal Hill Mortuary, there to lie in stnte until a. commission and a band of necromancers fix on a propitious site in the Eastern Tombs for a final sepulchre. So far the post mor tem expenditures on Kwangsu have been more than L',000,000 taels, and it is estimated that before he and the late Dowager Empress have been laid away with their ancestors for good and all it will have cost China and the estates of their late majesties (i,()OD,000 taels ($4, !i00,000.) For the first time foreigners were permitted to see a royal funeral procession . The Herald is worrying over the possi bility of the Federal Government going into bankruptcy under a continued lie publican administration. It also expres ses its thanks for Bryan's defeat on the ground that he might have been blamed for the dread mouth and hoof disease, which is'prevailingto such an extent. We can not see how the hoofing and mouth ing of Mr. Bryan in his campaign could affect innocent and useful cattle, but we do believe if the same method of exter minating this cattle disease was applied to perpetual Presidential candidates the better element in the Democratic party would bo glad, for it is very evident that a few more of Bryan's hoof and mouth campaigns will destroy the solid South as a Democratic aset, which is about all that they count on with any degree of certainty, when they take their quad rennial inventory. ,, Hit. J. C. Kai.iikuh, State Uamc Com missioner, says plenty of game was left over after the eloso of the season and that ho sees no reason to change his be lief that ,,a decidedly important factor resulting in benefit to our bird lifo as well as game is the destruction of vermin, such as weasels, minks, wildcats and foxes, brought about through the pas sago of the Kless bounty law, and the in telligent work of many ngents of the com mission. Data collected from mnny parts of thu Stato show the presence of ruffed grouse in numbers. A very general in crease of wild turkeys in sections where they are found at all and the presence of quail in localities and in numbers has led toconsiderablearguments and discussions regarding the disposition of the quail to migrate from one section of this common wealth to another, as do the woodcock. Quail have appeared this spring in sec tions of the State where no such birds have been heard or seen for several years. ' ' Washington Letter. Dec. 15th. Throughout this session and until the adjournment of the extra session, which thePresidentwillcall, the most important legislation before Con gress will be the measure revising the tariff schedules. The tariff bill will not be reported until the now Congress as sembles for the extra session. But the Ways and Means Committee has been holding hearings at which representa tives of the various interests nffectcd by the proposed revision have appeared and submitted statements outlining their demands in the preparation of the revised schedules. The great industries of Pennsylvania are depending upon Senator Boies Penrose to protect them in the enactment of tariff legislation. Since Congress assembled for this ses sion Senator Penrose has been one of the busiest men in Washington. The great lumber, mining, glass cutting and other manufacturing industries of the Keystone State have sent delegations to Washington to consult him regarding the schedules in which they are interest ed and to appeal to him to see that they are dealt with fairly in the revision. No othcr'Senator will have more to say re garding the proposed legislation than Senator Penrose. As the representative in the Senate of the greatest industrial State in the Union and as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance he occupies a commanding position in the enactment of tariff legislation. The tar iff bill will be referred to that Commit tcewhen it reaches the Senate, and Sen ator Penrose will be consulted with re ference to every provision affecting Pennsylvania. By reason of his famili arity with the industrial conditions in the Keystone State, Senator Penrose is well equipped for the work of preparing a tariff measure. He is a stalwart pro tectionist, and while he recognizes the fact that many of the schedules should be. revised the prediction that lie will in sist upon the fullest protection for the industries of his State is a safe one. The certainty that Penrose will be re elected has greatly increased his influence in the councils of the Senate. Already there is talk of his selection as chairman of the Committee on Finance, in many respects the most important Senate committee. Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, who has been chairman for many years, has announced that he would retire from public life at the end of his term and the general belief at the capitol is that the Pennsylvania Senator will be his successor. Senator Penrose now has one of the most important chairmanships. As head of the Com mittee on Postoflices and Post lloads he directs the deliberations of the great business committee of the upper branch of Congress. At each session that com1 mittee prepares nnd reports the largest appropriation bill considered by Con gress. it provides expenditures lor tne entire postal service. At the last ses sion it authorized appropriations ag gregating about 

W.OOO.OOO. An index to the extent of the Committee's work is found in the fnct that on one day last week, President Roosevelt sent to the Senate the nominations of more than four hundred postmasters. Each of these appointments must be considered separately by the Committee before it can be reported to the Senate for con Urination or rejection. In addition to his duties as chairman of the Commit' tee, Senator Penrose is chairman of the Postal Commission, which is now lire paring a bill, which, if enacted, will bring about an entire reorganization of the business methods of the Postofiice Department. Senator Penrose is a con spicuous example of the United States Senator who more than earns his salary

Answer filed. 1 FIFTY YEARS AGO. What Was Thought Then of the Future of the Coal Trade. The Wilkes-Barre Record of the Times is reprinting from its files the current news of that city fifty years ago. The following extract from an article which appeared last week will interest many of our readers : "It is well known that the Delaware & Hudson Coal Co. has been purchasing and leasing so as to extend their opera tions down the Lackawanna to Scran ton. having nearly exhausted their mines around Carbondale. Wo have heard of negotiations nearer llkes-Barre. Scran ton has its magnificent railroads to fur nish with tonnage. The Pennsylvania Coal Co. has its road and the D. & 11. its canal. If they extend their purchases much lower down, where are the North Branch and Wyoming canals to seek tonnage? Is it good policy for the canal companies to permit rival companies to monopolize thu best lands remaining without an effort to prevent it? Anthra cite coal really should bear tho compar ison in value to other coals that gold does to silver. We hope our coal men will have 1111 understanding among them selves and ceaso to sacrifice the black diamonds. Let them insist on a fair re turn for it. The amount of coal sent from Honesdale bv tho D. & II. Canal Co. is nearly 300,000 tons, being 1:15,000 tons less than last year. Tho amount sent from Hawley by the Pennsylvania Coal Co. is (iOO.OOO tons, being 00,000 tons moro than last year. We are afraid that even our wisest business men do not appreciate thoreckless extra vaganco with which we are squandering our anthracite deposits. Take the amount of coal sent to market and allow an average of ten thousand tons of coal to an acre, what an extent is excavated each year!" FOR JOB PRINTING call at tho Tho Citizen Office.
