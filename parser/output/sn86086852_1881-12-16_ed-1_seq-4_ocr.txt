Tmlil, “ I want a regular dipper-built boss. 1 don’t want stiffness and breadth of lioam so Hindi as I want a good dean run. I want a boss to show off with.” “ Well, sir,” raid tin- doctor, patting on tin- in i k a vicious-looking animal which In- licit! by the bridle, “ if you want a smart burse, 1 cunt recommend a belter animal than tins. .Inst, look at those heels ! 11 i, don’t go near ’em. As I told yon I have three horses that 1 want to sell ; but if yon want a mare that will go, Ibis mare is just the ani mal you want. “ You see," said the captain, confi dentially, “ I don't know Hindi about burses. I'm a seafaring man. Fol lowed the sea, man and boy, nigh thirty live years. Now I’m going to settle down on shore, and I’m looking around 1.,r a wife. I don't mind Idling yon that |’m sorter courtin’the Widow Bunn. Now, the widow is mighty fond of a good fas horse, and there’s another fel ler, Sam Bliss perhaps you know him that's shinin’ round the widow, too. Sam's got a tirs'-ratc boss, and takes the widow to ride a, g >od deal. Now if i don’t get something better than Sam’s got I won’t stand any show, for the widow will he sure to ride most with the man that’s got the fastest boss, don't you see." Tin- doctor nodded affirmatively. “ I see,” he said, “ I see. Well, now, 1 think the mare will suit you. She’s a knowing heasl. .lust see how her ears are laid hark, li-lening. If you find her getting la/v, just touch her up a little with I lie whip’ and she’ll climb, I can tell yon." "Well,” said the captain, “If she’s all von sat- she is, bring her around to night and turn her into my pasture, and lo morrow I II hitch her up in my in w hiiygv, and give her a trial." Tue next afternoon <’apt. Todd ran Ids new buggy out of the barn, and throwing a tmlil r over Ids arm, sum moned li.II l ike and proceeded I ithu pasture where the doctor had left Ihe mare the previous evening. Bill Tyke was the captain’s right I I tid man. lie had sailed with the eaplaie -iff Ids life, and now that the former had retired from active duly, Itill had n tiled with him, and under taken to learn llie art of tanning. In appearance he was like what the im moital Bnushy might have been, and he w is not mneli the inferior id' that worthy in taciturnity or oracular wis dom. 1 The captain and his factotum cir cumnavigated the pAstun and “Imre down” ii{Min the mare persuasively from the windward. But the intelli gent animal saw them coming and flat tened her ears. The captain was within reach, when she threw up In r head, changed ends, and cantered away to the other end of the field. The captain swore a round oath and divide his fon-i s. Bill Tyke was .-ecu to coast around the fence while the caniam lav "ll and on” in the offing. But it was a game that she understood best S. trolled leisurely around the naslure. keeping tantalizing out of reach, and resisting all the blandish ments offered her in the shape of wheedling words and ears of corn. The captain and Bill Tyke hot fell to sweating, and followed the beast atotind lor an hour. At last, with con sTimale generalship, they succeeded in cornering her. and as she tried to rush hetwei n them, both sprang at her inline. The captain was successful and Imng on like gum death, hut Fill Tyke failed to secure a satisfactory grip, and was kicked head o\t r heels into a blackberry hush, whence he emerged, lorn and bleeding, and swearing worse than ever. As to the captain, lie was dragged a hundred yards before he managed to “1> i ird " her, !• it last he found himself on her haek, tearing across tile pasture, and hounding a foot at every jump. The mare made straight for the bars, went over them, and filially e one te. halt in tliecaplaiu's doorvard. the captain slipped off’in an xhaiisted eoiuinioti, and drove his new nut-chase into the harn. Tin- operation of harnessing was one teipiinng al! the seamanship of both the captain and Bill fyke to success fully perform, fhe uses of the various straps, hiiekh-s and " belaying-pins were the subject of several animated diseu-sions before the harness was finally adjusted. When all was com plete Bill Tvkiv.cruised around the wagon several tunes, and observed that the “darned thing was all right, any how. " “ Then," aid the captain, “just put the old boat anchor into the buggy with about three fathoms of stout line, and von get in behind. Darn ye,” he con tinued. addressing the mare “if ye p!a\ a trick like that again. I'll fix ye." Bill marched off to the too house and returned carrying an old iron kee loek and a coil of inch manilla rope, lo one end of this lino he fastened this anchor. Ihe other, by the caplain's direction, l.e th-d by a double hitch in the rear axle of the wagon. Nowf >aid the captain, "jump in. Bill. I'll makt the old vixen hum when we get the widow in." f’o the captain's great delight the wid< w was ,0 home, and surveyed the new turnout with admiration. The harness, she thought, looked so in e wha' peculiar, hut she didn’t know much about such things. Of course she would eo to ride. Mow kind of tlir captain. What a beautiful horse. 8 u- w as not long in getting ready, for expedition at such tunes was one of the widow's many virtues. The captain helped lu r in, and the marc trotted placidly off, while Bill Tyke sat behind with his legs hanging over the “ stern ” of the wagon. 11 was a delightful drive. Ihe mare’s hi ad was turned away from home, ami she heha'cd herself much better than the captain expected, fhe sun was setting as they turned about to go home, and as the evening shadows began to fall the captain began to grow tender. Gradually his arm slipped around the widow's waist. Promptly she removed it. ‘‘Captain Todd,” she exclaimed, “you must not; I cannot allow it.” She glanced back at Bill Tyke, who still sat (tangling his feet over the taih tHiard in the most hUsstVd unconscious ness. “Oh, don’t mind him,” said the cap tain. “He don’t see nothing.” “It isn't tlmt," said the widow, blush ing. “but—l suppose I ought to tell you—in fact, I don’t know as I had ought to come to ride with you at all because —” “Because what?” “Because I am engaged to be mar ried soon.” “Engaged!” roared the captain, “who to?” “To Mr. Samuel Bliss.” “Heavens and earth!” yelled the captain, giving the mare a savage cut w ith the whip ; but he had no oppor tunity to add more, for the mare made a holt as though to jump out of iier skin, and tore along the* road like mad. The widow shrieked, and grasped the captain by the arm. “Oh, don’t, don’t!” she cried. “Let her rip!” exclaimed the cap tain, more forcibly than jiolitely. “I want to get hum. Engaged to Sam Bliss. Good Lord!” The captain gave the mare another slash with the whip, and Bill Tyke rose up on his knees and held on for dear life. It was getting dark rapidly. The road was full of deep holes, and the sieda of the road were bordered with dumps of bushes and large rocks, over some of which the carriage bounced like a rublter ball. The mare had it all her own way now, for she had the hit between her teeth, and was on a dead ruts. “Hold her up, cap’n; hold iter up,” exclaimed Bill Tyke, in evident alarm. “Port your helium an’ lay to.” “Hold up your grandmother,” re plied the captain, savagely. “I can’t bold her any more than 1 could hold a three-masted schooner in a hurri cane.” The widow relieved herself of a series of piercing screams and threw her around the captains neck. “I nljall he killed!” she cried. “Oh, captain, dear captain! For heaven’s sake stop the horse anil let me gel out.” The captain gave a quick jerk to the reins. The bridle gave way and 'noth lie and the widow went over backward in the bottom of the wagon. The mare increased her speed if that was possible, and the occupants of the vehicle devoted all their attention to keeping on lioard the craft, which touched tlie ground, apparently, about once in fifty feet. The captain surmised that the mare would make straight for Dr. Brigg’s corn crib, and, if the wagon held together long enough, they might come to a hall there; though as for stopping right side up, it was scarcely to he hoped for. The mare was evidently not that kind of ft horse. “We are almost to a long hill,” shouted Bill Ty ke. The road thus far had heen straight: hut at tin* fool of the long hill was the lane that led to the doctor’s harn, and the captain surmised that at their pres ent rate of speed the entire party would gel out about the time the marc turned the corner. The captain extricated himself from the widow’s petticoats and threw him self around the wagon seat. “All hands on deck!” shouted the captain. “Ay, ay, sir!” responded Bill Tyke. “Let go the anchor!” screamed the captain. Bill Tyke raised the keeloek in his arms mid thing it overboard. It hound ed along the road from side to side for a few yards, and then caught under a large rock among the hushes. The mare darted headlong onward; the stout rope straightened in a second; there was a crash like the report of a cannon; the mare fell forward on her knees, tearing up the ground as .-he went; while the widow,'hit captain and Bill Tyke shot up into the air ah< mt six feet and alight ed in a semi-iiaeonseious condition amid the wreck and debris of what had heen the wagon. It was the end of Cap’. D-aid’s court ship. The wagon was an indistinguish able mass of kindling wood; the mare had broken both fore legs and required to he shot, and tin* widow kept her bed for three weeks afterward. Tint captain again follows the sea, for, as he often remarks to his first mate; “The sea, Bill, is our proper sphere. We know more ahoiilsailin’ vessels than we do about drivin’ horses.” “Speak for yourself, cap’ll,” Bil* al ways replies. “At my end of the wa gon I did my duty.” Concerning Corn. The demand for corn increases every year. Until very recently none was wanted for exportation and little was used at home for oilier purposes than food for men and hogs ami for the man ufacture of whisky. The demand for corn for export is now very large, while its nst> at home have Multiplied. The glucose manufacturers of the country consume immense quantities of it, and a considerable amount is used in starch factories. More corn is now fed to the cattle and sheep than was the ease a few years ago. For the production of fancy heel and mutton, such as is wanted for shipping to Kngland, corn is necessary. Feeding corn to milch cows is a com paratively new thing, l.t it is practiced try a large number of dairymen in all parts of the country. Attention has lately heen called to the somewhat limited area of country that is adapted to the profitable produc tion of corn. It is true that it can be produced in every stale and territory on this side of the Rocky mountains, but it is a profitable crop only in a small proportion of them. F.xcept in a few counties in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee, it cannot be produced to much profit south of the Ohio river. The western limit of the profitable pro duction of corn is about two hundred miles west of the Missouri. North of lowa corn is likely to be killed by fnwt before it matures, and only the quick growing varieties can he raised. Fast of the Allegheny mountains, except i;i favored localities, corn is only products! at the expense of a large amount of la bor and the application of considerable manure. F.very year a larger area of laud is brought under cultivation, and the pro ductior.s of wheat, rye. oats, barley, to bacco, cotton and potatoes is extended. But the area of corn land is not increased to any considerable extent. We have new wheat fields in Minnesota, Dakota, California, Oregon and Washington; new cotton fields in Arkansas, Texas and southern California, and new to bacco fields in almvst every part of the country. But the area planted in corn remains restricted. Corn raised inO’.iio, Indiana, Illinois and lowa goes north, south, east and west. It is wanted in states where large quantities of other breadstuff's are produced and where but little is raised. Some hold that the ter ritory where corn can be profitably produced is becoming more restricted every year. They slate that the Indi ans raised good crops of corn in the ex treme northern portions of Minnesota, Michigan and New York, and that cli matic or other changes have rendered its production difficult, if not impossi ble. They also affirm that corn is not profitably raised as far south as it was in the early history of t'>e country.— (Ji iso i/o Tims*. Few rt'erds About Canaries. Holden's l*ird Magazine.

FROM WASHINGTON. Fraud in ihe Pension Urparlwfnt— Wen brant and Mexico—tteovllle'a Flan —K. T. Prellncnysen, of St' Jersey, Takes Blaine's Place—ten eral \*v*. PENSION FRAUDS. Washington, Dec. 13. Commissioner of Pensions Dudley and Secretary of the Interior Kirk wood, of whose department the pension bureau forms a part, do not seem to be in harmony as to the importance to place upon the recent discoveries of frauds in connection with the procure ment of pensions. Secretary Kirkwood said that they had seemed of sufficient importance to him to cause him to urge upon the commissioner the vigor ous prosecution of the inqury. To-day the commissioner, when approached on the subject, ridiculed the idea of a conspiracy, and gave what he alleged was all the information in his posses sion, and, according to him, all that there is in the case. This was, that he learned recently that a young man named Sullivan, who had been an un successful applicant for a position in the bureau had heen writing to friends asserting that he had obtained a posi tion, and if they would forward uen sion claims to him, accompanied by a fee of jo he would, by reason of his {(Osition in the bureau he ENABLED TO SECURE THF.IR PASSAGE. In order the better to impress them he u:;ed in his correspondence the official envelopes of the bureau, a num ber of which fie had obtained by some means. He (Dudley) had secured his arrest for using the official envelopes, and this, he said, was all there was in the Cit-e. In answer to a direct ques tion, he admitted that he had heen urged by the secretary of the interior lo_ vigorously prosecute the case, hut -aid that this was the only case, and that the talk of any conspiracy existing among the clerks in the bureau was mi re moonshine. He did not under stand the secretary’s recommendation to prost cute,to apply to any conspiracy, for lie knew of none. Tnis, it may he said, is hardly in keeping with the re fusal of llie secretary to make public the details of the conspiracy because of his fear of defeating the ends of jus tice. A RESOLUTION. Sen. Davis, of West Virginia, will submit a resolution, calling on the sec retary of the interior for detailed information in regard to pension hands, to tlie extent of the frauds that have been practiced, and what has been done to prevent frauds and punish the offenders, etc. This resolution is to 1 ave tiic way for an investigation of the pension frauds by the senate com mittee on pensions. CAMERON'S CAMPAIGN—JAMES A. BEAVER FOR GOVERNOR. Washington, Dec. 13.—The Came ron class, or Pennsylvania stalwarts, who are now in Washington, held a secret conference last night to deter mine whom they would run for gover nor the coming fall. After an inter change of opinions it was definitely concluded that Gen. James A. Beaver of Centre County should he accepted as the stalwart candidate for governor. The only names considered were those of Beaver, ex-Spcaker Grow, and Tom Cooper, chairman of the republican state committee. Cameron’s right hand man, Boss Quay, was committed to Grow when Grow retired from the senatorial contest last winter, and agreed at a conference at Cameron’s house to support Beaver for senator, and Quay would have favored Grow in I (reference to Beaver its J it been possi ble to get anything like a start for his candidate, hut tlie other stalwart lead ers refused to entertain the question of Grow’s candidacy,. Cooper had more vitality than Grow, and was more diffi cult to dispose of, but the large vote cast for Wolfe in his own county of Dclwarc, with nearly as heavy a Wolfe vote in Chester, made it unsafe to unite upon him. Cameron, Quay, I’aimer, and ail llie stalwart leaders in attendance would have preferred Cooper to Beaver had ho heen regarded to- equally available, but they felt that the nomination of Cooper would be a direct challenge to the -10,000 republi can Wolfe hollers to organize against the ticket, and they reluctantly passed Cooper by to unite their forces on Gen. Beaver. There was some stalwart mis giving in accepting Gen. Beaver. He followed Cameron at Chicago, and act ed as chairman of the Pi nnsylvania delegation in the interest of Grant, and he (nit himself in entire accord with Cameron last winter when he was made the candidate for senator at Cameron’s house; but there is, never theless, some latent distrust of Beaver, lest lie might set up for himself in case <>f his election. It was finally decided, however that with the president thor oughly stalwart and ready to wield the whole power of his administration for the n initiation and election of Beaver by the most aggressive methods, Beav®r would he so welded to tlie stalwart line that lie could not separate himself from his friends. President Arthur is cognizant of tlie stalwart union on Gen. Beaver, and lie will al once throw the whole force of his administration to unify the party in Beaver’s support. He means to have Pennsylvania kept in tlie stalwart column. THE NEW 

PREMIER—WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE HAS DONE. Washington, Dec. 13—The name of Senator Frederick T. Frelinghttysen, of New Jersey, was sent to the senate by President Arthur for the nomination as secretary of state, and was promptly confirmed by that body without oppo sition. Frederick T. Frelinghttysen was born at Millstown, Somerset county, N. J.. •1. 1317, and is the nephew and'adopted son of Theodore Frelinghttysen. He graduated at Rutger’s College in 183(3, studied law, and came to llie bar in 183;L He wasappo'uted attorney-gen oral of New Jersey in 18(11, and reap pointed in IStitl, and was sulisequently appointed a senator in congress for New Jersey, for the unoccupied term of W illiani W right, deceased, serving on the committees on Judiciary and Pensions. In January, 18t7. his ap pointment as senator was confirmed by the election of the legislature, and his term terminated in 1860. The com mittees upon which lie served were those on Naval Affairs, the Judiciary and Claims. He was re-elected to the senate for the term ending in 1575, serving on the committees on Foreign Affairs and the Judiciary, and as chair man of the Agricultural committee. In 1870 he was appointed minister to England, but declined. He was re elected to tlie senate for tlie term end ing in 1877. 

SUOVIU.E S iff.AN—HE WILL PROLONG GUI TEAI'S LIFE. Washington, Dec. 13.— 1 t is said to he Mr. Scoville’s plan, in ease that Guiteau shall he convicted, to move an arrest of judgment—that the court has no jurisdiction. It is said that upon that law question Mr. Scoville, who has been unable to secure any legal help, will have eminent lawyers to as >ist him. Meanwhile the trial is threat ened with disaster owing to the illness of some of the jury. Nearly all of them have some disorder of the stom ach, owing to high living, to which none of them are accustomed, the al m,<st entire want of exercise, and the vitiated atmosphere of the court room. Worm ley, the colored juror, has a swol len eye, in which erysipelas is feared, and is also threatened with gastritis. Two others ol tlie jury are also sick itli severe colds. The court, acting under suggestions from the physician, has directed the marshal to give the jury more exercise. George Soovdle is reported to he entirely without funds, even to pay his lioard hilL He has left th® very modest hotel where he had heen living and gone to a cheaper house, and the lecture which he has planned to deliver next week is design ed to raise money to defray his current expenses. Mr. Scoville. Guiteau's attorney, said, refering to the possibility ot the de fense being requested to permit the trial to go on in the presence of eleven jurors in the event of the serious illness of the coloreu juror, that he would en ter into no such bargain. He would rather have a postponement of the trial, because he thought his client’s chances of receiving fair treatment would increase the longer time there was given the bloodthirsty feeling now prevailing against him to die out. Al luding to the expressions of bloodthirst iness daily brought to him and the as sassin in their mail, he said he feared if the present trial continued into Jan uary someone would put a bullet into Guiteau’s head. Mr. ticoville, in the me conversation, made complaint that since the day of Guiteau’s incar ceration not a single minister of the gospel had been to see him, which he says is inconsistent with the true spirit of Christianity.

VIENNA’S VICTIMS. A Fire In tin* Old i'ounlry That Kx luythiiicin the History ofilu- U orhl in liossof Life. Vienna, Dac. 9. —The Wiener Allc gemiue Zeitung, whose office is directly opposite the ill-fated Ring theatre, gives a graphic account of the catastro phe, ot which the following is an ex tract; We write with death in our hearts, unable to find words to describe the pain which we suffer. A horrible calamity befell our city, to day. The King Theatre, formerly the Opera Comique, is in ashes, and hundreds of human beings are victims of the catas trophe. Nothing like this horror has ever occurred before in this country. At ten minutes before seven o’clock the lire broke out. The theatre was pretty well filled, but happily not entirely crowded. A considerable number of people were still in the Foyer and dressing rooms, and a dense mass of carriages occupied the Schoiten ring. It had just commenced snowing and in addition to the Auditorium theatre, there was the usual bustle be fore the commencement of the per formance. People walking up and down looking for their places, and the noise of turning down seats was heaid on all sides. The boxes were still empty, but the balcony and galleries were well filled. On the stage, everything was in a state ot activity and bustle. The workingmen were removing the scenery, etc. Offenbach's comic opera, ‘‘Les Contes d’lioffman,” was to be played for a second time. Some su pers and actors had already taken their places on the stage in costume, hut. a large number, however, were still iu the dressing rooms in the hands of the costumers and hairdressers. The overture had not yet begun. How the five commenced cannot yet he definite ly stated, and probably it will never he known. According to one version the scenery was ignited by a spark from the electric machinery. According to another statement a workman with an alcohol lamp caused the disaster. The former version is the most likely one. Director Helemburger, who stood on the stage, was the first to notice the lire. In a moment “the Hies” were wrapped in tlames, the net-work of woou, ropes amt canvass burning like tinder. All those inside the building were pushing their way towards the street, which was crowded at all points; the audience from the theatre strug gled and crushed each other in the per istde and foyer, and confusion reigned supreme. Suddenly cries were heard from the windows of the theatre lead ing to the Ring balcony. Over the en trance was soon emptied, and the cries of those at the windows and of those within the theatre were awful, and swelled louder and louder. The mass of people in the street was growing denser constantly. AH the morning papers give long heartrend ing accounts of the catastrophe. Most of them place the number of dead at three hundred, but with persons who were in the 4th gallery yet to hear from, the number will he swelled to 500 at least. Even the police seem re luctant to speak of the extent of the dis aster. Neither firemen nor soldiers have as yet offered to penetrate the dreadful scene. The firemen who had assisted in bringing out the bodies from the third gal lery being asked. “How many per sons do you think there are on the fourth gallery ?” “Two hundred, aud possibly four hundred. We shall not know how many are dead until the people of Vienna send in a list of the missing ones to the police,” was the reply. The origin of the fire is not yet established to certainty, but of the cowardice of the officers and attend ants, who should have let down the iron screen, aud the general want of provision in the event of such a catas trophe, there remains no doubt. Vienna, Dec., 10. —The official list of identified corpses, gives one of them as Master Baar. from America. Among the missing persons reported by the hotel keepers, is a merchant named Buckwitz, of York, who is either an Englishman, or American. file latest information is that the total loss of life wiil exceed one thou sand. Decidedly Demons/ * Monthly is the most admirable magazine of its kind in the world. Being a publication of great utility iu the household, furnishing, as it does, valuable information no aM subjects connected witk home, no fam ily can very well do without it. In evert’ essential, it is a family magazine thoroughly reliable and comprehensive. Its stories are distinguished for literary merit; its poems are of more than av erage excellence; its sensible talk to women are a distinctive feature; and the topics of the month are discussed in a manner both suggestive and inter esting. The engravings alone are well worth the money paid for the maga zine (twenty cents). The January number is an excellent one. and con tains an exhaustive article, fully illus trated. which will give you valuable help in decorating ycur home for Christmas, the initial chapters of “The Admiral’s Ward.” by Mrs. Alexander, one of the best novelists of the day, and many other article* of superior merit, thus making one of the most at tractive numbers of this admirable magazine yet issued. A little Ohio girl, making a contri bution to the Garfield Monument Fund, addressed a quaint letter to “Mr. Com mittee, in vvuich she said : “I am a little girl 7 years old, and I live five miles from Hiram, our dear Pres ident's former home. Xow. my Uncle Oscar, living in Cleveland, Siid I could not spell hippopotamus. He bet me a dollar. I won the bet.

IRELAND. A Regulation Cabin in the Village of Bantry, Mj Lord Bantry and the Flanagan Family—A Contrast Irish Life Wofully Misrepresented in Novel and Drama. The Real Irish Mas, Irish Girl, and Irish Priest. From Cork Loiter by D. R. Lccke ("N.-t.-bv") in Tuli-Jo Blade. I left Cork day before yesterday for the village of Bantry, in county Cork, some forty miles distant, owned and controlled by My Lord Bantry, who is, or at least ou,ht to be, one of the rich est men in Ireland. THE REGULATION CABIN. Leaving the main street, which is, like all the streets of Irish villages, made up of small stores, or shops, as they are there called, you walk up a rather steep hill, through a crooked street, and you fine yourself in the midst of the regulation Irish cabins— miserable structures of stone piled one upon the other, not even daubed with plaster, with no windows as a rule, ♦ hough the more pretentious ones have a single pane of glass in the wall some where. THE TO-BE WIDOW FLAXAGAX. We went up the miserable stairs in one of them, and gained the still more miserable den above. It was more like a coffin than a room, and the idea of a coffin was brought forcibly to the mind as you glanced at the wretched occu pants. On a miserable bed of dried leaves covered with potato-sacks, on the one side was the emaciated form of a man dying of starvation and con sumption. He had about forty-eight hours of life in him. Upon my word, I felt happy to see he was so near death. For, having an excellent repu tation, having always been a good man, he was certain to go, after death, where there would not be the slightest possible chance for meeting My Lord Bantry. In the other corner was a flat stone upon which a consumptive fire of peat was burning, the smoke tilling tlie roots. Huddled around this tire were five children, under the watchful eye of a very comely woman. The children were barefooted and stocking less, and clad in the most deplorable rags, while the mother, also barefooted, was clothed in the regular cotton slip, without a particle of underclothing of any kind or description. And into that garret, poor as it was, came other women, not clothed sufficiently to be decent, to boil their potatoes at the wretched fire. They’ have a practice of exchanging fires in this way, that none shall be wasted. “What do yon pay for this apart ment?’’ “Tenpence a week, sor!” “Are you in arrears for rent?” “Yis, sor. Ho | pointing to her hus band] has been sick, sor, for months, sor, and cud not work.” “What will you do if he dies?” “We shall he put out, sor.” This with no burst of anguish, with no special tone of anger, or manifesta tion of emotion. To be “put out” is the common lot of the Irish laborer and the Irish wife, and they expect it. And within a mile of that wretched spot, of that dying man and starving children, my Lord Bantry has the most beautiful castle, with luxurious furni ture,and filled with pampered flunkies, Lirf crowded with tbmost, won derful homes, and his table groaning under the weight of the luxuries of every clime. Surely not for tenpence a week will he tear this woman from the side of her dead husband, and throw her with her helpless children out into the cold and wet street? Yes, hut he will though. For ibis family is hut one of many thousand on the land which a hail king stole from the people who owned it. Were this but the only case, he might relent; but, should he do it in this case, he would have to do it for the others, and tenpence a week from thousands aggregates a very large sum; and my Lord Bantry’s expenses are very high, for it costs money to run a castle. If I ever leaned toward the doctrines taught by the Universalists, a contem plation of the system of Bantryism has entirely and completely convinced me that they are erroneous. If there is not a lake of fire and brimstone, a very wide, and very deep, and very hot one, there ought to be, and when the British House of Lords meet there, there will always he a quorum. And my Lord will lift up his eyes to the Widow Flan agan, and beg for a drop of water to cool his parched tongue. But he won’t get it. He doesn’t deserve it. WOEFUL I .ACE OF KNOWLEDGE. It is impossible to make an American comprehend the width, depth, and breadth of Irish misery until he has seen it with his own eyes. No other man’s eyes are good for anything in this matter, for the reason that nothing parallel exists on the American side of the water. And, besides this, the writers for the stage and of general literature have most wofully misrepresented the Irishman and woman,and very much to his and her disadvantage. The Irishman of the stage and novel is always a rollicking, happy-go-lucky sort of a reckless fellow, with a short tailed coat, red vest and corduroy trous ers, woolen stockings and stout bro gans, with a bottle of whisky peeping out of his pocket, a blackthorn shille lah in his fist, always ready for a dance or a fight, or for love-making, or any other pleasant employment. There is. always on hi* head a rather bad hat, worn jauntily, however, and, though he may be occasionally rather short of food, he manages always to get enough to be fat. sleek and rosy. And then he always has a laugh on his face, a joke on his lips, and he goes through life with a perpetual “ hurroo.” And Katy, she is always presented to uj cl and in a short woolen gown, her shapely legs inclosed in warm red stock ings, and she has a bright red handker chief about her neck, with good com fortable shoes, and a coquettish straw hat —a buxom girl w ho can dance down any lad within ten miles, and can “hurroo” as well as Pat, and a trifle belter. The Irish priest is always represent ed to us as a fat, sleek, jolly fellow wh> 1 is constantly giving his people good ad vice, but who, nevertheless, is always ready to sieg “ The Cruiskeen Lawn,” in a rich, mellow voice,” before a splen did fire in the house of his parishioners, with a glass of poteen in one hand and ] a pipe in the other, the company join ing jollily in the chorus. He is sup posed to live in luxury from the super stition of his people, and to have about , as easy a life as any man on earth. LIES. All these are lies. The Irishman is the saddest man on the surface of the globe. You may travel a week and never see a smile or bear a laugh. Utter and abject misery, starvation, and helplessness are not conductive of merriment. There is unquestionably a vast fund of humor in the Irishman, which would be delightful could it have proper vent. You hear faint tones of it as it is; but it is in the minor key and very sad. It always has a flavor of rack-rent in it. a taste of starvation, a suggestion of eviction and death by cold and t unger on the roadside. It isn’t cheerful. I had much rather have the Irishmen silent than to bear this remnant of jocularity which is always streaked with blood. ' THE HUSH GIRL is always comely, and, properly cloth ed and fed, would be beautiful. Still she is comely. Irish landlordism has not been sufficient to destroy her beau ty, though it has done its best. But she has no gown of woolen stuff; a cot ton slip without underclothing of any kind makes up her costume. The comfortable stockings and stout shoes, and the red kerchief about her neck, are so many libels upon Irish landlord ism. Were My Lord's agents to see such clothing upon a girl, he would immediately raise the rent upon her father, and confiscate those clothes. And he would keep on raising the rent till he was certain inat shoes and stock ings would be forever impossible Neither does she dance Pat down a‘ rustic balls, for a most excellent rea son; there are no balls; and, besides, when she has cut and dried a donkey load of jieat, and walked beside that donkey barefooted in the cold mud twelve miles and back again, and sold that peat for sixpence, she is not very much in the humor lor dancing down any one. AS TO THE I'RtEST, there never was a wilder delusion than exists in the minds of the American people concerning him. I was at the houses, or rather lodgings, of a great many of them, hut one example will suffice Half-way between Kenmare and Kil larney, in a wild, desolate country, lives one of these parish priests, who are supposed to inhabit luxurious houses, and to live gorgeously, and to he perpetually singing “The Cruiskeen Lawn,” with a pipe in one hand and a glass of poteen in the other. He is a magnificent man. In face and figure he is the exact picture of the lamented Salmon P. Chase, one of the greatest of Americans; and I venture the assertion that, had he adopted any other profession and come to America, where genius and intellect mean some thing, and where great ability finds great rewards, he would have been one of the most eminent of men. Now understand that this man is the lawyer, the friend, the guide and direc tor in temporal as well as spiritual matters, of the entire population of this district. If a husband and wife quarrel, it is his duty to hear and de cide. If a tenant gets into trouble w ith his landlord, he is the go-between to arrange it. In short, every trouble, great and small, in the parish is re ferred to him, and he must act. He is their lawyer as well as their priest. He is their everything. He supplies to them the intelligence that the most in fernal government on earth has denied them. But this is a small part of his duties. He has to conduct services at all the chapels in this stretch of country. He has to watch over the morals of all the people. But this is not all. No matter at what hour of the night, no matter what the condition of the weather, the summons to the bedside of a living man to administer the last sacraments of the church must be obeyed. It may be that to do this requires a ride on horseback of twenty miles in a blinding storm, but it must he done. Every child must he christened, every death bed must he soothed, every sorrow mit igated by the only comfort this suffer ing people have—the faith in their church. What do you suppose this magnili cent man gets for all this? The largest income he ever received in his life was £IOO, which, reduced to American money, amounts to i.xactly $484. And out of this he has to pay his rent, his food, his clothing, the keeping of his horse; and all that remains goes in charity to the suffering sick—every cent of it. When the father dies, his nephews and nieces will not find very good pick ing from what is left, I assure you. “Why do you,” I asked, “a man ca pable of doing so much in the world, stay and do this enormous work for nothing?” “I was called to it,” was the answer; what would these poor people do with out me. That was all. Here is a man capable of anything, who deliberately sac> ifices a career, sacrifices comfort, sacrifices the life he was fitted for, sinks his iden tity, foregoes fame, reputation, every thing for the sake of a suffering people! “I was called to it; what would these poor people do without me?” I am a very vigorous protestant, and have no especial lf>ve for the catholic church; hut I shall esteem myself es pecially fortunate if I can make a rec ord in this world that will give me a place in the next within gunshot of where this man will he placed. lam not capable of making the sacrifice fur my fellows that he is doing—l wish to heaven I was I found by actual demonstration why the Irish so love their priests. They would he in a still worse way, if possible, without them. Short and Long Hauls on Hailroads. Last summer the New York Cham ber of Commerce propounded some leading questions to the railroad mana gers of the country in respect to the charges on freight and transportation, and among them was the following concerning long and short hauls; What do you think of the practice of charging more for a short than for a long distance? For instance $4 per 1(H) pounds from New York to Salt L ike City, and $2.50 from New York to San Francisco? One of the railroad officers makes the following answer: If the railroad company were able to tix the rates front New York te Sait Lake City, and also the rates from New York to San Francisco, and should, ar bitrarily, make the lesser rate for the longer distance, it would be very fool ish It would be simply equivalent to making a present of that much money to the San Francisco shippers, and, while there might not be anything par ticularly wrong in it, it would hardly be considered a business transaction. But if the ra’e from New York to Salt Lake City is in itself reasonable, and less than the service is worth; and il the rate from New York to San Francisco was already less by water route than the route to Salt Lake City, then the railroad would be entirely right to compete in San Francisco for New York business at whatever rates it could By being free to do this, it could gain a considerable new business. .Profits from this business would help to pay its expenses and interest, and coptribute that much to reducing the average rates, which it could, afiord to nv.ietoSalt Lake City, and all other points along its line. A moment’s re flection will show that Salt Lait City is one of the places against which nature has discriminated most heavily of all places of the continent, being surround ed by mountains and deserts. Before railroads were built, while the rat* from New York to ran Francisco—l,ooo , miles farther—was. p*rhajs. as now, $2 50, the rate to Salt Lake City was, | jjerhaps, 

SIOO. Here, then, was a nat ural discrimination of $97 50 against Salt Lake City. The railroad has re- j duced that discrimination to $l5O. I Whenever the railroad can secure a still larger amount of through busi ness from tian Francisco, and, perhaps, from China and Japan, so as to reduce its average expenses, the rate to salt Lake can be still further reduced, and the discrimination lessened, so that, in fact, the discr minalion. which enables a road to secure San Francisco busi ness, is in the true interests of Salt Lake shippers. Take another c.-se illustrating the same principle: Corinth, Mis.-., at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio and the Memphis and Charlesion railroads, is ninety-three miles from Memphis, and 23S miles from Mobile. A reasonable local rate on a hale of cotton from Corinth to Memphis would be, say $1 per bale. Memphis is about as good a cotton market as Mobile. Consequently, all the cotton raised in the vicinity of Corinth will go to Mempbis, unless the rate to Mobile is made the same a 5 to Memphis. Between Corinth and Mo bile, however, are many stations where much cotton is brought for shipment. We will take Tupelo as an illustration, -bO miles from Mobile. Now, if $1 a bale is a reasonable rate for ninety-three miles, the rate from Tupelo to Mobil*. 2SO miles—might very well be $2, If, therefore, the Mobile and Ohio road competes in the market at Corinth for cotton, it will be charging less for the longer haul from Corinth than for the shorter from Tnpeio. And. if the law should step in and forbid this practice, the Mobile and Ohio road would simply have to withdraw from competition at Corinth. The shipper at Tupelo claims that the Mobile and Ohio road is discriminating against him when it hauls Corinth cot ton for $1 and charges $2 from Tupelo. But would it benefit him to have the road give up all Corinth cotton and withdraw from competition at that place? It could not afford to reduce at Lnpelo. and twenty either stations similarly situated, in order to secure a few hundred bales from Corinth at a low rate 1 . It would then he less able to leauce rates at Tupt-10, and all other local points on its line; and nobody on earth would he benefited but the Mem phis and Charleston railroad, which would have a monopoly eif the hauling eif Corinth cotton, and Corinth would f*se the benefit of competition from the Gulf. The effect of any law to restrict the freedom of rosds to aet in this manner would simply destroy competition. Take another example, illustrating the same thing, except that the com petition is between a railroad and a water route. Fond du Lae. Wis., is 14S miles from Chicago, on the line oi the Chicago A Northwestern railway. The lumbering interest is very large there, and the products of the saw mills, shingle mills, and sash, door and blind factories are nearly all shipped to Chicago, the great distributing point for the northwest. A car-load of lum ber from Fond du L ie to Chicago, load ed and unloaded by the owner, costs (-ay) $25. Green Bay is 05 miles far ther up the hue than Fond du Lae, or 213 miles from Chicago. Green Bay is largely interested in the lumber busi ness also, but it has the advantage of being on the neck of Lake Miehicaw. and shuts nearly all its lumber to Chi cago on vessels, which is i heaper than by rail. On a certain day the North western railroad his a dozen empty ears standing on the side track at Green Bay that arc to ho returned to Chicago. A lumber dealer telegraphs the General Manager that he will pay twenty dollars per ear for their use from thence to Cnieago, and load and unload them himself. The offer is at once accepted, the service performed, and two hundred and forty dollars is paid into the treasury of the company. The price paid was, say five dollars per car less than the rate from Fond dn Lae, with sixty-live miles more haul. But the choice was between two hun dred and forty dollars and nothing, for the cost, to a railroad company, be tween hauling loaded and empty cars is of nominal account. There is a little more wear and War, and a few pounds mere steam, but the extra expense is inconsiderable. The lumbermen at Fond du Lac are indignant at what they call “ the unjust discrimination” of the r vTroad company in favor of their rivals in business at Green Bay, and the Irate newspapers at the former place call loudly for a pro-rata tariff. Nobody complains that $2-5 per oar is too high from Fond du Lac to Chicago, hut the idea that it should cost only $2 per car-load for a haul that is sixty tive miles farther away from market is what worries them. Now, if the Northwestern Railway company had been prohibited from making this special agreement by the enforcement of an indexible pro-rata tariff act, it would have benefited no body but damaged (1) the railroad cor poration to the amount of S3OO, (s(> to Ik 1 added for drawing empty cars); (2) it would have injured the lumbermen at Green Bay, because it would have deprived them of taking advantage of competition, and placed them wholly in the power of the vessel owners; and (3) it would have damaged the lumber men of Fond dn Lac, because, being prevented from competing with the water route from Green Bay, the rail road corporation must make up its 10.-s by keeping up its high rates at the for mer place.
