President Wilson's address at the ! opening of the session of Congress to-day was' wholly devoted ' to domestic subjects, principally-the problem of railway legisla- ' tion. ; ' " ' " !-. .. In the Hall of the House with Senators and Representatives assembled in joint seion, President Wilson in, accordance with . the custom he began at the opening of his term, Tead his ad dress from thederk's desk. - : j , , ., . ThePresident not only renewed his recommendation for . legislation-to prevent a nation-wide railway strike or lockout before there has been Opportunity for investigation, but defend ed it against the attack of organized labor sas nothing arbitrary or"unjust and the "justifiable safeguarding, by society of -the necessaryNprocesses of its very life." '-v : -. J'-:, , Aside from recommendations for the passage1 of the Porto Rico 5 government bill, n the corrupt practices bill and the Webb bill to legalize American collective selling agencies abroad, the President's address was devoted wnolly td the railroad situation: The only feature which had not been forecast was the elimina tion df the proposal that Congress give explicit approval to con ' sideration by ihe Interstate Commerce Commission of an ih- 1 crease : in freight rates to meet additional expenditures by the raurqaas eausea uy me operauuir.ui Hie uaiiisuii ia.w, ... , , To-day, the. President took the position that "the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear and a rec ommendation, by the Congress -with regard to such a matter iniht 'se'em to draw in1 question the scope of the commission's authority or its inclination to do justice when there is no. reason Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. "Inasmuch as, this is, gentlemen, probably the last occasion I shall have to address : ttte Sixty-fourth Congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satisfaction I have co-operated with you & the many measures of con structive policy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I . take the liberty of congratulating you upon the completion ' of a ' record of rare ser viceableness . and distinction." . The President's message follows ' In uH:.V , - , ' "Gentlemen of the Congress: J ''In' fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me , by, the ' Constitution of ' communicating to you from time to time ? information of the state of the Union and .recommending v-to your , - consideration such legislative meas J vlt6 'as' may be Judged ; necessary and I expedient I shall continue the prac- tice, .which -I . hope has been accept- able tov you of leaving 'to the reports of the j several heads ofttie executive ipartments the 1 elaboration of the detailed -needs of . the publio service and1" confine myself tp those matters of more general public 'policy, with whichjit seems necessary and feasible to -deal 'at'thepresentjeson of the .Congress.,1 r . -.'7- ."I realize the limitations of time . 'under which you-will necessarily act at this ; session and shall make , my suggestions as few, as. possible; but : there Were some ' things left undone at the', last session which there' will now be time, to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of tha-pilblicv tpdo at once. ; , 'In the first place, it seems to me imperatively necessary - that the earl iest possible consideration, and . action oftoulA, . be v accorded .the remaining ' measures of the Rrogram of .settle- mrent and' regulation which I had oc casion to recommend, to -you at the close' of your last session in view of the 'public ' dangers1 disclosed by the . unaccommodated difficulties which : then ' existed, and which still unhap pily1 continue - to exist, between the ' railroads of the country and their; 'lo- ' cojnotive engineers, ' conductors:, and trainmen." f - ' "I then recommended; . v' "Firsts t immediate- provision for the i enlargement and administrative reor- ganizatlon of the ? Interstate- Com merce ' Commission along the . lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives and nowi awaiting action by the Senate; in . order tljat the Commission may be enabled o deal with the- many grejat and various' duties now devolv- 1 ing upon it with a promptness and thoroughness , whioh are, with itsi present constitution and means of ac tion, practically impossible. f ; r "Second, thel establishment': of : an elght-5:our day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employes-who are . actually engaged in the work of. oper ating trains in interstate transporta- tion. i , ,. 4 "Third, the authorization of the ap- 1 pointment by the President of a small body of men to observe ..the- actual re . suits in ' experience of the adoption of th ei-ght-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men, and for the railroads. - . ". , ' '.Fourth, explicit approval by the Congress of the consideration by the Interstate . Commerce Commission of '.' an , increase of freight rates . to meet such .additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been 'render ed necessary by the adoption of the eight-hour day and which have not been offset by administrative read justments and economies, should 'the . facts disclosed justify the increase. "Fifth, an amendment of the exist ing" ; federal , statute which provides for ther. mediation, conciliation,- and ' arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision i that,v in case the methods of accom- . modation now provided for should fall, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be " instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be at tempted, l "And, 'sixth, the lodgement . in. the hands off the Executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control v of such,, portions' ' and- such rolling stock , of . the railways of, . the country as may be required for mili tary, use and to operate them for mili tary . purposes, with authority to draft imto the nilitary service of the United States 'such train.' crews and administrative officials as the circum stances require for their safe and effi cient use. ' "The 'second and third of these recommendations the , Congress?, Im mediately acted on: it estatlishea the eight-hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train, service and it authorized- the appointment of a commission to observe and. report up on the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately need ed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions -until- an opportun ity should, be offered for a more de liberate consideration of them. , The fourth recommendation I do not deem it .-necessary - to renew. The power of the Interstate Commerce ; Commission to .grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to( is' indisputably clear and a . recommendation by the Congress, with regard to such a matter might seem .to draw, in question the scope of the Commissions authority or its inclination to do justice : when there is no reason to doubt either. ' ' ,'The other suggestions thein crease in the Interstate ' Commerce Commission's' membership and in its facilities for, performing its ,manifold duties, the ; provision for (full public investigation and assessment of in dustrial disputes, and the grant to the Executive of the power to control and operate the railways when necessary in time of war or other like public ne cessity -I now .very , earnestly renew. 'The necessity: for; suck legislation is manifest and. pressing, Those .who have entrusted me with the respon sibility and duty of serving and safe guarding them in such matters would find it ..hard, I believe, 'to excuse a failure - to act upon these grave mat ters or any, unnecessary ".postponement of action upon them. Not-only does the Interstate , Com? meree .Commission now' find it prac tically impossible, with -its present membership and organization, to per form its great functions promptly and thoroughly but it is not unlikely that it may presently , be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting, it must first be perfected as an administrative instru t.ient. . ' . ' ; j: VThe couhtry cannot and should npt consent to remain any longer expos ed to profound industrial disturbances for Inck of additional means of ar bitration . and conciliation which the Congress can easily and promptly sup ply. And -Vail will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the executive to make Immediate and uninterrupted 'Use of the railroads for the concc ntratioii of . the r military forces . of ,the nation v wherever . they are needed :, and whenever . they, are needed. 1 " "This is p, program of regulation, prevention, and administrative effi ciency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. . With re gard to one of its items, the ' increase in the efficiency t of ; the Interstate Commerce Commission, the House of Representatives Jias ; already acted ; its action needs only the concurrence of the Senate. , - . v V ' "I - would, hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the Congress would hesitate to act upon the , suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupation . should be 'obliged by law to continue in ,an employment which , he . desired to leave To pass a law which forbade or prevented the in dividual workman to leave his work before receiving the ' approval of so- ciety in doing tso would be to . adopt a new. principle into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we arc not prepared to. introduce. But the proposal that . the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the' con certed action 6f organized bodies of men until a publio .investigation . shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment- of the opinion of the nation is not to propose - any such principle. It is based upon the very dif erent principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation ' shall - have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employe and employer, time to form its opin ion upon an impartial statement of the merits, : and opportunity to con sider all practicable - means of con- cilation or arbitration. I cap see noth ing in that proposition but the justi-, fiable safeguarding by society of the necessary processes of its very life. There, is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it unless it be arbitrarily ! and un justly done. It can and ; should be done with ' a ' full and scrupulous re gard . for the interests and liberties of all concerned as welt as for the per manent interests of society itself. "Three matters of capital import ance await the action of ' the Senate which have already been acted upon by the House of Representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom . of combination to those en gaged in promoting the ; foreign com merce of the country than is now thought ' by some to pe legal under the terms of the laws against mono poly ; the . bill amending the' present organic law of Porto Ifico; and the bill proposing a more thorough and systematic ; regulation of the expendi ture of money in elections, commonly called the Corrupt Practices ; Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifesti circum stances .which render their : adoption at this time hot only opportune but necessary. ' Even delay would- seri ously jeopard the interests cf the country and of the government. --"Immediate, passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than ?the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I re fer; because at least 'two years, will elapse before ' another election in which federal officers are .to be'fllled; but it would greatly relieve the, pub lic mind if this important matter, were dealt . with while the . circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the, present method of obtaining and spending campaign' funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditures can be frankly studied in the light of present, experience ; . and , a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object . connected with it might.: be thought to be in the mind of those urged it. Action can be -. taken : now with facts for guidance and without suspicion ' of partisan purpose. . v ' ."I'shall not argue at length the de sirability of giving a freer hand n the matter' of combined and concert ed effort, to; those, who - shall 'undertake the( essential enterprise of buildings up our export-" trade. ; - That ', C enterprise will . presently, will immediately as sume, has indeed already assumed, a magnitude unprecedented in our ex perience. We have not the necessary instrumentalities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created uponan. ade-; quate scale .under our " present laws. We should cleair away all legal ob stacles and create a basis of undoubt ed law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated li cense. The thing must be done now, because , the, opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or de lay. ; ;.; 1 : ' The argument for the proposed amendments of. the organic law, of Porto Rico is brief - and conclusive. The present ; laws governing the ; Is land and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have created expectations of ex tended privilege which we, have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a ' suspicious doubt with regard .to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of . the pending measure, would happily remove. We do not doubt what, we wish to do in any es sential particular. We ought to do It at once. '' "At the last session ef the Congress a bill was passed by the Senate which provides for the promotion of voca tional arid industrial education which is of vital importance to .the whole .country because it concerns a matter too ..long neglected, upon which the thorough industrial preparation of the country for the critical years! of eco nomic development immediately ahead of us in very large measure depends. May I not urge its early and favorable consideration by the House ofl Repre sentatives and. . its early enactment into law? It contains' plans which af fect all interests and all parts of the country, and I am sure that there is no legislation now pending- before the Congress whose passage the coun try awaits with , more thoughtful ap proval or greater Impatience to see a great and admirable thing set in the way of being done.. .. .- "There . are other matters already advanced to the stage of conference between the two Houses of which it is not necessary that' I should speak.
