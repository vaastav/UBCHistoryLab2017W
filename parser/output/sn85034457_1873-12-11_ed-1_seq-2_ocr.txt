THE WEEKLY DEMOCRAT, li, G-. GOULD, Editor. Thursday, Dec. 11, 1873. CUBA. The Cuban matter Again as Fiinics l ho appearance of a i eace Hb'.e eetlleniint, lut negotiations, h lwever, are still in a di-licute situation. That is the last at the time of going to presa. Matt H. Carpenter. President 'Grant comes to tlie rescue of Matt II. Carpenter, and vouches lbr his being sober at j-)Dg Drancli, on t!io day the slanderous report ai raided a- bout him. All that ia wanted now to make the in.itter a good joke, is for Carpenter to come out aud vouch lor the soberness of President Grant ! That would certainly settle the question ot Matt being a decent man.. President's Message. On our first page will bs the President's Message in full. The New York Sun, in speaking ot this document eays: "The message of Gen. Grant vfill dis appoint the c untry generally, and even the caiidi l members of his own party. While dealing seemingly somewhat in detail with certain large questions up on which the country desires to know the opiuious and purposes of the Administration, they are really handled in a vague and unsatisfactory mauner, leaving one about as much in doubt, after reading the message through, concerning what Gen. Giant and his Cabinet believe and inteud, as on first taking up the document." The Democratic party in New York may congratulate itself that the profeecution, conviction, and twelve years' -sentence of Tweed was principally due to the ac tive influence of the prominent men iu its own ranks. The dif- ference between .Democrats and Republicans is, that while the former publish and punish scoun drels in their own ranks, the lat ter whitewash and screen theirs. Let the editor of the Eaton Reg ister make a note of this while he is making merry and exulting over the fact of the conviction of a leading Democrat, for his steal ing. Noyes is no better than Tweed, and while the Democrats sent their thief to the Penitenti ary, the Republicans made an effort to elect theirs Governor of the State of Ohio. That is the difference between the Demo crats and Republicans of to-day. v j In alluding to the conviction of Tweed as "contrary to the usual mode of treating Demo, cratic scoundrels," the Register endeavors to cast a Btigma on the Democratic party. Now, will it please tell us what is the "usu al mode" of Republicans how many oi its scoundrels have been tried and convicted, in the past twelve years? And while the Register has its hand in this bus iness, it might just as well fur nish its readers with a list of the prominent Radicals in this State as well as in the Nation at large, equally as great scoundrels as Tweed and fully as promiuent in the Radical part' as ever Tweed was in the Democratic party, whose rascality the Regis ter, along with other Radical journals, are excusing and cov ering over, instead of imitating the example of the leading Dem ocrats iu New York, exposing them and using every effort to .bring them to justice. "'Take the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye. Now Tweed that the conviction of proves that scoundrels who have stolen millions of the people's money can be tried and convicted, would it not be well for other cities, afflicted with dis honest oflicerR, to make an at tempt to bring them to punish ment. The Republican city of Philadelphia would afford a splendid field lor operations. We know of no place where more game of that kind might bo brought down. President's Message. A Bad Example. Ve are not one uf those who undertake to make the Adminis tration . liable for every evil which exists in i he country, from irregularities of weather to finan cial panics. But we do hold tli at the course of the Radical party during the past twelve years has been one of su-di reck less extravagance and political demoralization, that it is respon sible for inaiiv of the pocial and po'.iticul evils frcm which the people of the land suffer so giiev onsly. The ase of public mon eys increasing vv.th every session of Congress, the utter ("isregard of every restriction of decency and honesty by the national leg islature, and the examples of the President himself, have nil tend ed to generate habits of extrava gance and pampered luxury, which have taken root with fear ful rapidity and spread over the land, bearing the bitter fruits of frequent financial ruin and ev ery kind of social disorder. There is a growing tendency to hubits of living, which not only are injur'ous in themselves, but, which pressage that condition of eociety which has marked the decline o' every republic which ever rose and fell. It is particu larly impottant, that the rulers of this nation and its representa tives before the world, should maintain that simplicity of re finement and stern integrity of economy, which iu the early days of the Republic, won for it the sympathy and confidence of the whole world. Instead of this, the present Administration has by its example, pandered to and encourased the tendencies of the age, and its influence has been potent in favor of the establish ment of social customs totally at variauce with the spirit or stabil ity of our institutions. The man sion ol the President has been made the centre of luxuTy, to support which most lavish ap propriations have been ' made, and the recent salary eteal of $100,000 was rendered necessary. As an example of the "style,' which marks the domestic econ omy ot the White Uouee, We copy the following from the El- rnira Herald: "At the Corning Glass Works a set- of glassware, destined for the Presidential Mansion, has just been completed. It consists of two dozen goblets, which are cut about halfway up the bowl, the remainder ot the bowl being richly engraved, and prominent. among it is the United States coat of arms: four'dozen cham- Lpagne glasses and saucer bowls, cut and engraved as the goblets; cwo dozen regular champagne glasses, engraved as the others; six dozen canary colored hock glasses; Eeven dozen rubj'-bowl, flint stem sauterene glasses The colored glasses are very superior. There are also four dozen claret, six dozen sherry and four dozen cordial glasses; two dozen finger bow ls, which are cut and engraved with the coat of arms; three dozen punch glasses, with handles; four d zen ice cream plates, cut and engrav ed as the glasses. The value of this glass is about 2,000. . It is not a full set, but ordered to make good the full set sent to the White House some time since. It is gt ten up with the beat of taste, and of most exquisite pattern, engraving ia perfect." The In the modest days of Martin Van Bureo's administration, an inventory of the furniture of the White House was taken, and its publication excited a storm of indignation against public ex travagance, which swept over the whole land. In times like these, when bun drtds and thousands of working- men see nothing before them but sore distress and pinching want, what would be the result on the party in power, if the people could be furnished with an inventory of the '-household and kitchen furniture" of our ex ecutive mansion, wherein 2,000 worth of glassware is needed to "complete a full set." What an example to the world of the sim plicity of Republican , inslilu n t tions : dnu it is scarcely a cen tury since Benjamin Franklin, in home spun garb, represented the nation in the courts of E-uope. O ! the times. O ! the manners. If you want the Dk.molis.vt for 1,50, send in a new subscriber. What the People Expect of Congress. In the Forty-third Congress, which assembled last Monday week, tlie Republican? have ov erwhelming majorities in both houses. That party will be held to a rigid accountability lor what Concrete does or fails to do to get rid of the thieves and plun dere-H, great and small, who have so lunar ruled aud robbed the people. The minds of tnc poor le are steadily iixed upon this particu lar subject, and these particular men. Long spun speeches and harangues sibout Cuba and the money panic, accompanied by high sounding threats of war and shallow schemes of finance, will not be allowed to divert pub ic attention from the brazen rogues'in Congress, and the mal tcasencss whcieof they have been proved guiby. Evesybody knows who the culptits are and where in they have offended; and all erood citizens regard it as among the first duties of Congress to sweep its own nails clean ot us own. rascals. Until the two Houses do this, few people will lie disposed to listen putiently to their talk either about the sacred nosa of the A mericau Hag or Uhj expediency of specie payment'. The peo ple don't want to bu preached to Vby Credit Mobilier bribe-takers, back-pay and forwardpay grab bers, and Pacific Railway swin dlers ; by Senators who have bought their seats and Represen tatives who have sold their votes; by politicians who fawn upon power that they may enjoy its patrouage, nnd covet places of trust that they may plunder the public. The first session of the pres ent Congress will have much to do with determining the future of the Republican party. We agree with the Cinciuna ti .' nquircr, that the seventy -sev en Democratic members of the House who voted for Ferxaxijo Wood, for Speaker, -"blundered out of a charity which su.Tcreth long aiid is kind." It would be more correct to say that the Democratic caucus and the gen tlemen who followed "its bidding outrageously and disgracefully violated the pledges of the party, ignored the wishes of the great body of men.tb.ey profess to rep resent, and offended the better instincts of the honest friends of Democracy. It is true, Fernando did not vote for the salary grab he was absent and lhe New York World states upon authority, that had he been present he would not have done so, but aside from this, he was so closely connected with Boss Tweed in his robbery of the city of New York, that he has not the record of a very hon esS man, ana we tninK a more creditable selection for the Dem ocratic complimentary vote could have been made, and thus proved that the party is sincere in its de mands for honest aud spotless men in public positions. AVe will see, however, how -they will act when the repeal of that infa mous robbing scheme comes to a vote. The general opinion is that we have touched the bottom of the financial crisis, and that from the present a better state of financial affairs may be confidently ex pected. We are heartily glad of this and think the facts war ra:it this conclusion. Business appears to be everywhere im proving and more confidence is manifested in financial and busi ness circles. Many of the rail road companies are ie employing their discharged bands and the iron and other manufacturing establishments are resuming bus iness, and suspended bankers have again opened their doors This is cheerful and makes us all feel as if the wolf had been driv en from our doors. Our yearly supply of gold at the date of the discovery of the precious metals in California was about 3,000.000. It sprang up at once to 25.000,000, running up to its uiaqium figure in 1853 of o'8,000,00O. For the last sev en or eight years it has averaged not far from 70.000,000. [From the N. Y. Sun, Dec. 2.] We yesterday bad the fortune to receive the following commu nication : "Sir: The course you are tak ing towards Spain is ruining your paper here and throughout the West. At a meeting here last night you aud your paper were condemned as trying to raise a Avar with noble old Spain, that b.ae done more for the hu man family than all the other nations of Europe together. The resolutions passed declare that you have been trying for years past to get up a war between the United States and .;pain, and therefore that we as Democrats cannot support yon nor your paper so long as you pursue your preseut course. W are sorry to abandon The Sun. Meetings are to be held in other places. Many Subscribers. "Lkwisburg, Preble County, Ohio Nov. 25, 1873." All the Democrats of Preble county who arc dissatisfied with The Sun's advocacy ot Cuban in dependence and willing that the Hag ot the United btate-i snould be insulted on tlie high seas are respectfully invited never to read it again, and to find some other paper that will bo more agreea ble to their sentiments. If there have been any anti Cuba war meetings held in Lew isbnrg, b' Democrats: or any other partisans, our reporter at that point, deserves to be quar tered for neglect of duty. We are of the opinion, however, that the above communication was got nil by some cowardly Radi cal that was a vigorous war man during the late "unpleasantness,'' but remained at home to abuse his neighbors for not going into the fight. - -' .- Nine hundred and forty thou sand operatives are employed in the production . of iron in the United States; 42,000 of these are employed in preparing ore and fuel; 25,000 in preparing fuel for rolling mills; 42,000 in the rolling mill; 22,500 in blast furnaces aud 3,000 in bioomer ies; 80,000 are engaged in man- ufacuring articles of iron. Thus we have a total of 940,000 men emplo3-ed in the iron interest. The value of pig i ; on manufac tured last year was $75,000,000. Ti e production of tho rolling mills and forges was $03,000,000 and the value of other manufac tured iron for the year was D00, 000,000. The Buifalo Courier says that the rejoicing of vario us organs ef the administration over the conviction of Twuerl, and their snarling pretentions that none ot their sort of elect shrll be grati fied by the dawn of a new and better era in iolitic3, ia purlieu larly amusing and .euggeetive view of the fact that these same prints applauded a President who recently let a half million thief, Paymaster Hodge, loose from the Albany penitentiary, and procured the pardon of the Philadelphia municipal thieves, Marcher and Yerkes from the Pennsylvania State prison. The Constitutional Convention has reassembled at Cincinnati. The members were on hand force at the hour of opening. Their ; onstituents sincerely hope they will go to work in earnest and finish up the job, which might juntas well have been completed in Columbus before the meeting of the Legislature. Samuel J. Ttlden, a Democrat, insured the detection of William JVT. Tweed. Mr. Tilden now 6tands higher than ever in the Democratic party. What lead ing Republican has brought any of the Republican . robberies the light and yet retained his po sition in the Republican party? lhe public debt statement for the last month furnishes the cheerful bit of information that the increase of the debt for the thirty days immediately prece ding the first of December, was only $9,038,576. That's all. Besido the surprising develop ment of strength among the farmers, there was another sig nificant feature in the Illinois elections. There were special elections to fill live vacancies in the Legislature, that number of Republican members having re s!gned, and not a single Republi can was elected. Bring iu a new subscriber and try the Democrat for $1,50 the next year. Some salient facts about Cuba are in order at tins time, ine island lies only 130 miles south of Florida. It has nearly 50,G0O square miles of area and a coast line of 1,600 miles. The island is intersected by a range of lofty mountains, running east and west. Eastern and Western Cu ba arc the political divisions, the former being the home of the re bellion. The population ot East ern Cuba is. whites, 100,000; col ored, 143,000. Western Cuba, whites, 376,000; colored, 399,000. Of these latter 305,000 are slaves. Total population, 1,021,000. Defalcations and embezzle ments are becoming so numer ous among the Radical officials in Iowa that they are no longer telegraphed, A Deamoinea (Iowa) paper has the following list of defaulters in one issue : "James D. Ends, State Super intendent of Schools, 150,000. "James A. Byran, Treasurer of Jackson county, 50,000. "The Treasurer of Dubuque county, 3d,00'J. 'Tlie Treasurer of Decatur county, 12,000." The reform movement iu the West was not begun ine day too soon. Professor Chandler, of New York, in a paper read before the Health 'Association, said that during the war there Was a ru mor that Southern emissaries in tended to poison the drinking water of the city.
