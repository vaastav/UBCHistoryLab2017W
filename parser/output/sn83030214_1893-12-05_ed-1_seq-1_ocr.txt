AN'.I RED THE MOTION LOST I)V A SM M.I, M UOR] | y Taris. Tier. 4.?Tho most Interest was mani j,. ted to-day in the Chamber of Deputies re? garding the declaration of the new Government. Nearly all the members were In their seats, and the galleri wera i... ked with an eager audience, Including many women. Aftei ihe declaration had been read there was a debal on a Socialist proposal for amnesty to political, ? . snd strike offenders; there was great dis* order several times In tho course ol the debate, and tho proposal was Anally defeated by a majority of Bl. -j. Caalmlr-Ferlcr, th.- new Premier, read tho Ministerial dei laratlon. He said thal the re- ; suit ?f Ihe recent general elections proved the Inalienable attachment of the people t.> the Republic, and tii?- country's aversion to re- i action and aversion to the Si i lallsts. The Gov? ernment, h** added, intended to combat Social- ! Ism by real refarmi and the ami lloratlon of the ' ' condition of tbe working classes. The Prime ' Minister announced that u radical reform ? mid be effected In the system of direct taxation, ' which would lu.- p|aced -ni a more just basts. ' This statement was received with cheers on all -Mea Continuing, M. Caslmlr-Perler said thal the Laii I laws would bo recast, and a pension fund ?published for the beni QI of old and disabled workmen. In n terence 11 the Bank of Prance ho said ||aprivilege would be renewed, as tho bank was essential to Anani dal stability. The Govern? ment would organise agricultural credit and in surauce. lt would oppose the separation of Church and stato and a revision of the Con? stitution. Tho home and foreign policy of tho Oovernmenl would be Inspired by tin- dignity of a great Nation able to defend its rights by pa rfu- m.-ans. M. Paschal Groussct, Socialist, proposed that pneral amnesty be granted to all political, press and strike offenders The Chamber agr.1 to an Immedial ? discussion of the proposal, and M. Grouseet sp ike warmly In favor of the ex? iled Boulanglsts Many persona guiltier than they, ho said, were now sitting In the House. Ho appealed to the Oovernmenl to forgive the minors and others who had been condemned during excitable strike periods, and declared that tho Boulanger eonsptrai v would never have been undertaken had the Republic done Its duty. M (.roussei was constantly Interrupted the Conservative and Oppor i : i 11 by members i tunist l? :. M. Raynal, Minister of the Interior, spoke In apposition to Ho- amnesty proposal. The Gov srnment, he said, did not believe that the hour had come t * pass a sp.ini*.- over the crime of treal in ti the fatherland. At this point M. Mary, Socialist, sprang lo his fe.-'.. "You ar*- a miserable wretch!" An uproar followed, amid which could be heard eries for censure unless the offender with? drew Ma expression. M. Mery declined to do so unless M. Raynal withdrew his Imputation thal th'- Boulanglsts arere traitors As ho (Mery) was formerly a Boulangist, he said ha constd ered M. Raynal'* remarks personal. He donled that tho RoulaSglf-ts were anti-patriots; they rather, he said, had sought to Infuse patriotism Into corrupt French p'ditlrs. h.. then added that, as ih-- Chamber had permitted him to ma'.-- this explanation, h?- would withdraw tho epithet, "miserable wretch." After this digression M Raynal resumed his re-i.arks. He sal l he waa willing to leave his? tory to Judge whether or not the Boulanglsts ahould i*o cslled anti-patriots Applause at this polnl fi im the Opportunists caused an uproar among the Socialists. When lt hal subsided M Raynal declared that he was aol in li*, r of granting amneaty. Th?- Gov <? lent might pard lltlcal offenders, but it ought firmly to oppose general amnesty. M. Ernest Roi he, a writer on "L'lntransi g< -." Henri R tchefort'a paper, pathetically 1 ? 1 that, though amnesty might be wrong lldal point *'f view, from whi.-h point M Raynal looked al the subject, it would be an h. ? if humanity, lt was a measure of clemency which universal suffrage demanded, and it eh iuld have i- n prop sod by the majority. He closed by dei taring that tin* sentiments -if the opp m-iits ol amnesty were anti-French and antl-Republlcan, ami won* animated by i lan t.i'. i md dasi fear. t a proposal of M. Grouseet was thea put to v n an '? w i- '? ?? ted, ZS. to Ht. A . irding to the gossip in tho lobbies of thc Mouse, the vote on the amnesty proposal is ' considered a moral defeat of the Cabinet?and this too, on Ihe Brat vote taken since the new ' MlniMrv wont Into office.

I'or. 4?The reassembling of th* I.Hld Congress at noon to-day for Us regular -??-?<iiin offered ii singularly tame and common? place spectacle to the few sightseers who oc? cupied tho yawning benches of the House and Senate galleries All the excitement customary at tin- I ici .'inlier meeting had boen anticipated hy tho calling of the extraordinary session of last August, and tho 

BOOMS which enliven the opening day of each new Congress were, of course, Incspable of imitation or reproduction. Tho long and wearying contest over the passage of th- Wilson Repesl hill had left the members of both houses Bomeirhsl "off edgs" for new I'-gislatlvo efforts and tho prevailing air at both ends of tho Capitol when the houses met st noon was on.- of lassitude and ennui, strangely In contrast with tin- hustle and gayety which mark tho appearance of a new body of legisla? tes a.i Un- Capitol on tho lirst Monday of i '? i mi.??!? every other rear. In th.- S-nato there was a fair quorum, nearly two-thirds of tho entire membership being re corded as preeent. In the House, however, only a scsnt majority was in sight, and unusual apathy marked Un* greatly abbreviated routine "f an ..pening day. To add to tho sobriety of feeling in both branches each member knew that th.- (Ians a! I.oih ends of the Capitol were Hying at half mast as a mark of respect to the t? . Pennsylvania Heptvscntatives, Mr. O'Neill and General Lilly, who had died during thu brief r..ss since November 1, and that the proceeding in both branches were soon to be brought io a termination after the receipt and nailing of the President's message by the ad journment customary upon the announcement "f a member's death. ? 

CRAMS ( At.'M.S A FLURRY. There was little about the opening day cere moniee in the Senate to repay the spectators who straggled one by one, up to noon, into the freshly upholstered galleries. Karller In the morning a little excitement had been occasioned by th*- boisterous conduct "f a --crank," who presented himself at the Senate main door and loudly d.-maii.Iel th.it he should be sworn In ss a second-rate Senator" from Vermont. He de? clared that ho had been duly elected and hsd come to Washington to claim his seat and hla rights. H.- was promptly arrested by an officer of tho Capitol Police, who recognized the In truder as Samuel .*->. Ames, a man whom he had arrested two yeats ago under similar clrcum stsnees This litth* florry over, nothing serveij to hs.,rh the attention Of the 'arly coiners but the tepested entry of the Senate employes from the tide lobbies, bearing all sorts of floral designs 1 a- S<*iators' desks. The absurd opening day I oral emblen habit had apparently suffered no ; bstement because "f the brevity of the recent M, and startling vagaries of the florist's fancy towered toward th.* galleries from many Senator's] desks Senator Vuorhees, the "John Psul Jones" of the silver repeal fight, was among tbe tirst to be honored, a horseshoe of uses, however, instead of a loni frigate, deoo rstlng his desk lld, buring a card "From Your Hoosier Friends" Mr. Turple. his colleague, who is far from somnolent In either his oratorl . al or his every-day manner, was no doubt startled to rind his desk encumbered with a floral pillow.

THK si --pin PROMPTLT IN OEMS. Vlce-Prosldont Stevenson -arrived early, snd sharply at noun stnnk on the table with his gavel for order. The only business to be dons by tin- Benste was to semi its committee to tn fnini the President that Congress was In ses? sion and ready to receive any communication he might wish to make. Mr. McPherson and Mr. Sherman wron sid.-i ted to perform this duty. After a roth all had shown a quorum pres? ent, and while waiting to hoar tho result of their visit p. the White House, the Senate killed time by taking temporary recess In the House Speaker Crisp rapped for order al noon, and a tedious rollcall was promptly begun to show a quorum present; -MO mem bers answered to th*-lr names, and from flfty to 160 "f them then promptly disappeared Two new membera wen- next sworn In?Mr. Bundy, of ohio, who succeeds General Enochs aud Mr. Griffin, of Michigan, who takes the place of Mr .Chipman. Messrs.

Meanwhile, as in tbe Senate, a recess was ord.-t-ei| Tho galleries, which had -been thinly till"-! al the outset, wen- now almost de? serted. < >n the floor the desks foymeriy occupied by Messrs.

The total failure of the President to meet the natural expectation In both branches ai a declaration of policy on the Hawaiian question could scarcely be con? strued otherwise than as a supercilious exhibi? tion of indifference to legislative opinion.
