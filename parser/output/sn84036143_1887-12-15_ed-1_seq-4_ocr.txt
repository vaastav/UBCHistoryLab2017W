^I|,c Illicitly Ifjcraltl. FISK BROS. Publishers. R. E. FISK,......Editor THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1887. The full text of the Blaine interview appears in the Herald. Our contempor ary mangled it by striking out important parts. _ A more orderly city of twelve thou sand inhabitants nowhere exists than Hel ena. yet on what seems the slightest ap pearance of disturbances that seldom come the police force is increased a third in number. A regular force of ten first class men is all sufficient to patrol the city and protect person and property, Reduce the police, keep up a good electric light sys tem, and everybody will be sale and con tent. _ The bill that Senator Far well proposes to introduce, making State and municipal bonds the basis of banking under our na tional system seems to be a good measure, and with proper protection deserves to be adopted. The proba bility is that State debts will soon disappear with the national debt, but municipal debts for construction of water works, sewerage system, etc., are increas ing rapidly, and if they could be made available for a basis of banking the result would be that more favorable rates of interest would be granted to the borrowing municipalities._ Secretary Fairchild's report is much superior to the President's message, but it Iia< some very weak points. As one of the argument for the repeal of the internal revenue taxes, he says it will enable us to abolish the offices and officers necessary to collect them. That is not a very powerful argument. Any kind of tax involves some expense in collection, but our revenues are collected as cheaply as those of any coun try. Again the Secretary says the inter nal revenue taxes are unpopular at the South. So are any kind of taxes, and this is one that the S'n*h can relieve itself of to any extent it chooses by limiting its use of whisky and tobacco. We still have hopes that our government will undertake to supply the country with a telegraph service. To make it a success beyond all peradventure, it should operate the telegraph exclusively, just as in the until service. For this reason it would be essentially unjust to drive the present com panies out of service and not take their property off their hands at some fair val uation. We would not pay fancy prices for watered stock, but at a fair ap praisal. and in payment therefor govern ment bonds should be issued. As the service increased and extended the cost of the additional plant should be supplied in the same way and the service should be charged to pay the interest on the debt. The same buildings used for postoffices should be used for telegraphing, and dis patches should be sent and delivered by the mail carriers. The National Republican Committee has fixed the time and place of holding the next Republican convention. Chicago is the place and the 19th of June the time. The contest for place of meeting was strong and well sustained by Cincinnati, St. Lonis, Minneapolis, Omaha and Fargo Chicago deserved the honor by a record that the whole country is proud of. We have no reason to question the justice of giving Dakota extra representation in the covention, but Montana is as justly enti tled to the addition as Washington. It comes as near being Republican and is as justly entitled to Statehood. Our chief interest in the convention is to see the can didate nominated who can lead the Repub lican party to victory upon a policy of pro tection to home manufactures and labor, and spirited foreign policy that shall aim at no less than the mastery of the seas and the control of the world's commerce. A 

PROMPT REPLY. The wool growers and manufacturers are on hand with a prompt reply to the onslaught of the President. Their answer is complete and Mr. Blaine's is to the same effect. It is shown by the experience of reduction made in 1883 that the result is a large increase of im ports and revenue. The complaint is that we have too much revenue now, but the course recommended by the President is a!»olutely certain to in crease that revenue. Under the tariff of 1867, the revenue from imports of wool was less than two millions, but under the reduced tariff of 18S3 this revenue has been over five millions. It is a purely false assumption that the President's plan is for reduction of revenue. It is for the -ole benefit of foreign wool grow ers and manufacturers, and a direct at tack upon one of the most important in dustries in this country. The reduction of the duties on wool in 1883 has been followed by a reduction in the number of sheep and the production of wool. A further reduction would destroy the interest entirely and ruin a business in which $500,000,000 is invest ed. The worst enemy this country has could not have aimed a more fatal blow at a vital interest. It is folly to say as some do that this industry is strong and prosperous and doc- not need protection. The facts disprove it. The industry is fast declining under the reduction made in 1SS3. Another blow of a similar kind would utterly ruin it. And with this industry destroyed, is it imagined that our people will get any cheaper or better goods from the Eng lish manufacturers? No! the only material and possible result would be that we should pay more and get poorer goods. The man who puts his head into a lion's mouth may possibly get it out again, but he is none the less a fool fur taking such desperate chances. 

BLAISE'S REPLY. The extended criticism of Mr. Blaine on President Cleveland's message will be read with greater interest by the public generally than the message itself. Though written on foreign soil, it is American in every word and sentiment. The President having rested three years of his term on the top rail of the fence, for fear of demoralizing his party on the tariff'is:-ue, now that he is the accepted standard bearer of his party for another contest and compelled to join issue on something besides civil service reform which has been dragged in the mud and torn to tatters, proceeds to get down on the wrong ssde of the fence in the worst possible place and in a very demoralized condition. There was a time when this issue of protection against revenue tariff would have been much more doubtful than it is to-day. That was before the war and the abolition of slavery, when the greater part of our public domain was still un occupied and when we had a large and powerful commercial class and interests. But that time has gone by. The South is no longer exclusively interested in raising raw material ; our com merce has faded from the seas and our public domain, or the better portions of it are occupied. Driven from the oceans our capitalists have turned their attention to inland commerce and to manufactures, with the results that have astonished the world and ourselves. There has never been a period of our history when we prospered so greatly as since the war, under Re publican policy with protection to our manufactures. We have paid off the greater part of our war debt, more than doubled our national wealth and have an overflowing treasury. We have be come the greatest manufacturing nation in the world. Nothing but stark madness should induce us to change a policy that has borne us such good fruits. In a few years more of the same policy we shall be out of debt, with more wealth than ill the nations of Europe combined. Bv cultivating and encouraging home manufactures we have become the most independent, self-supporting nation in the world. If war should come now, and we were cut off from all foreign na tions by sea, we could get along very comfortably and not lack for any of the necessaries and lack iur but few of the comforts and luxuries of life. No one could state more clearly and forcibly than Mr. Blaine has, the folly of directing all our energies to the culti vation of the soil, creating a glut in home and foreign markets and wearing out our soil and wasting our strength for the benefit of foreign manufacturers and ocean freighters. By turning our atten tion to manufactures we have created a home market for the products of our soil, which is all our own and worth more to us than all the markets of the world besides. It has enabled us to place and use to advantage all the vast foreign immi gration that over-crowded Europe has sent us in increasing volume. But for the construction of our railroads and the operation of our factories and mines this could not have been done. If all had been compelled to work the soil, compe tition in a single employment would have reduced wages to almost nothing. No ! we have made no mistake in choos ing the policy we have and it would now be the extreme of folly to change in any other way than by reciprocal treaties that would give us a full equivalent in market favors. Mr, Blaine only speaks of one feature of our policy, because the message only contained one idea. We know well enough that this matter of protection is but one position of Mr. Blaine's general policy, which would include the con struction of a navy and the estab lishment of a commercial union oi all the • nations on this continent. That is a policy worthy of our strength, and ambition as a nation. It would re quire the expenditure of a large revenue, all that we have now or are likely to have through a tarif of the most ap proved protective kind. We would not even remit the tobacco tax, which Mr. Blaine favors, and any surplus we have or are likely to have we would apply to the extinction of our war debt. As long as this debt remains or any portion of it, there is as much reason as ever there was to retain war taxes, if any one prefers the use of that term. The recent decisions ot the Supreme Court in the case of the Virginia bond holders is a very important one. It sus tains State sovereignty to an extent that will to many seem dangerous. A State debt is only a debt of honor. There is ab solutely no way to enforce it. The Virginia creditors may as well take what they can get and make the best of it. It will be found in the end that repudiation does not pay, even though it may be successfully practiced. In view of this decision it be comes a duty still plainer that the general government should assume and pay that portion of the old State debt fairly belonging to West Virginia. With the disappearance of oar old court house, we are all glad to see so much of the old debt extinguished that has hung over us ever since the old court house was built with money borrowed at 3 per cent, a month and subsequently bonded in 15 per cent, bonds. Bat we doubt the pro propriety of attempting to redeem so large a share of the debt in any one year. It makes the taxes higher than they should be, especially to city residents, who have to pay the heavy city tax as well. Our county warrants should be kept at par, and there is no good policy in redeeming 6 per cent, bonds, if we incur the liability of having to pay 7 per cent, on registered warrants. THE 

AMERICAN NAVY. The report of Secretary Whitney gives an opportunity to speak of what we hope sometime to be substantial fact instead of a fiction. It is a melancholy fact that the chief constructor of the navy reports that in six years more there will be only four of the present cruiser ships fit for service. At that time we shall be a na tion of seventy millions, the strongest, richest nation on earth, undisputed dic tator of the destinies of one en tire continent and heir apparent to the commerce of the world, . The fact stated by Secretary Whitney that since the close of our civil war we haye spent $75,000,000 on our navy and have little or nothing to show for it, in stea d of being a discouraging and de terring fact, ought to stimulate us to exertions to remedy the defect. It is something higher than politics for the creation of a first-class navy is to de termine our rank as a power in the world and also our control of the com merce of the world. We have little use for a large stand ing army, and with the best navy in the world, we would have still less need ot it. Again we are confronted with the necessity for suitable coast defenses for the largest seaboard that any country in the world possesses. Build a navy and it will be all the coast defense we need. If we set about building a navy, it will build up a plant that will soon en able us to build ships of commerce as cheaply as England does it now. When the transcontinental railroads were pro vided for and the rails were required to be of American manufacture, it gave an impetus to the business of making rails so that we have ever since been able to hold our own against the world. It will be the same if we construct a navy and require all the work and material to be of American manufacture. It will be an expensive undertaking. Admit it. The cost may be five hun dred millions. At least with that sum we could build a navy that would be superior to any at present in existence. But what are the stakes ? They are no less than the control of the world's commerce, and the profits of that com merce are worth ten times the cost at the highest figures. With a controling navy, all the weaker nations of the world would become our ready allies and patrons of our com merce and manufactures. We should not have to solicit their alliance and trade. These would be urged upon us. Foreign nations would stop picking up and annexing the islands of the oceans, and abandon what they could not hold in ai.y event of war. In event of a general war in Europe, which is conceed to be only a matter of time, even England would be necessarily a party thereto, and the United States, if prepared with naval equipment to furnish protection could easily regain at a single step the control of all the ocean commerce. The question would not thus be the cost of construction but the power to command respect to the Hag that would float over the vessel. Secretary Whitney even seems to have become a convert to the policy of subsi dizing steamship lines that in the emer gency of war could be commanded for that service. It is a most sensible and prolific conception. We could thus ex tend our commerce, encourage ship building in the United States and always have a reserve force for war purposes. The era of railroad building is so far advanced that it would not be checked, only supplemented by fleets of steel ships. We are now so far advanced towards the developement of our vast interior domain and its settlement that it is prudent to be looking abroad. Eng land, without a tithe of the interest that we have in the case, is subsidizing lines of steamships between Australia and Puget Sound. We could and ought to have three or four such lines on the Pacific and a doz en of them on the Atlantic to the vari ous countries of South and Central America. The construction of a navy and the announcement that we would make and maintain it superior to any other in the world, would of itself be the adoption of a national policy in every way suitable to our strength and proper ambition.

CONVENTION CALL. Chairman Jones, in his call for the National Republican Convention, has in a few masterly strokes outlined a policy that should unite the Republicans of the country and arouse them to score a vic tory that would advance the country an other quarter of a century to power and prosperity. It will not only rally those who have been Republicans, but it ap peals to the intelligent self-interest of all good business men in all parts of the country, and it appeals with especial force to the young men of the nation, ambitious to see their Country command an influence proportionate to her mighty resources. The call appeals to those who would protect American manufactures and labor in preference to foreign. This ap peal is enforced by the unexampled pros perity of the United States under the operation of the protective system, by the aid ot which we have piled up wealth as no nation before has ever done, enabling us to pay off a large share of our debt, giving us an overflowing treas ury, filling our land with railroads, factories and paying mines. Contrast this with the effects of the Democratic revenue tariff of '46, which left us almost in a condition of bankruptcy at the out break of our civil war. We are aware that there are some who are good Republicans on other issues and general principles, who have fallen into the errors so persistently taught by the Cobden free trade advocates, a poli cy suited perhaps to the present condi tion of England, but a policy that Eng land did not adopt till after her manu factures had grown to maturity and had acquired strength to compete suc cessfully with the world for supplying foreign markets, a point which we have not yet reached by a long way. We may reasonably expect that when this issue of protection is clearly under stood and its practical operations traced in our own history, there will be very few if any who have ever been Repub licans who will refuse its hearty support. We have greater reason also to expect that there are thousands of Democrats in every part of the country who will re fuse to support a policy that can be shown to favor England at the expense of the United States. Especially will this argument address itself with great force to those who have been forced by this English policy to become exiles from their own homes. i his low revenue tariff that Carlisle and Cleveland advo cate would render the United States as poor and dependent as Ireland is to-day. If the Irish in America once come to comprehend the fact that the success of the Democratic policy will send them back to grind in the mills of their old oppressors there will be a grand break from the party they have trusted only to be betrayed. Nor will the South be any better willing to give up their new am bition and pleasant taste of the wealth and prosperity that come from the intro duction of diversified industries and the application of skilled labor and mechan ical contrivances operated by steam power. If the Democracy is sincere in its ex pressed desire to reduce the revenue, they must abandon the purpose of re ducing the tariff duties, for any reduc tion except entire abolition will certain ly raise the revenues. A reduction of the duty on wool made in 1883 over the rates fixed in 1867 resulted in an in crease of revenue from that source of 150 per cent. If President Cleveland had been sin cere in his desire to deplete the treasury, why did he not recommend the reduc tion of the sugar tax, which pays fifty millions into the treasury, rather than the wool duty, which only yields one tenth as much. Most all of our sugar comes from abroad, aud a reduction of the duty will count nearly a full equiva lent to the consumer. And in connec tion with this reduction on sugar, the Republicans propose to encourage sugar production at home by a liberal bounty. The convention call is equally sound and clear in favor of "a system of naval and coast defenses that will enable the country to conduct international negoti ations with self respect. On this point we have recently said something and propose to say a good deal more. Especially worthy of commendation is that portion which emphasises the in justice of the continued, unreasonable exclusion of rapidly growing territories. That means Dakota, Washington and Montana. If there is a spark of justice and manhood in the people of the L nited States, they will emphatically repudi ate the party that refuses to allow the claims of new States from undisguised narrow partisan motives. All the youth, vigor, energy and man hood of the nation will unite in the de sire to adopt and proclaim a foreign policy that is suited to our strength, re sources, interests and ambitions. It is the outline of a policy that forgets not the services of those who have won our victories in the past, while it calls upon another generation to organize greater and happier conquests on the seas. We have no internal ene mies, none that we can possibly fear on this continent. We must go on ship board for future conquests, and the islands of the seas and the commerce of all nations is the grand stake to play for. This Republican call ought to quicken the pulse of every man in this country. Every fibre of it thrills with the throb of a great coming awakening and vic torv. Died. Dubuque, Iowa, December 8.—Hon.
