The resolution will be presented to the sen ate tomorrow by Senator Gronna of North Dakota, the agricultural com mittee chairman who will ask for Im mediate consideration. Members of the committee drafting the resolution expressed confidence that enough votes were assured to bring about its prompt' passage but members of the finance committee In dlcated that they would ask that It first be referred to them for consider ation inasmuch as the war finance cor poration was created under a bill drawn by their committee Restoration of the war finance cor poration to furnish financial aid to farmers also would be directed In aeon current resolution presented today in the nous of representatives by Byrnes Democrat of South Carolina. . The 1 senate agriculture committee decided ti represent a resolution as a commit tee measure, hoping thereby to save j time. With unanimous consent under the senate rules the resolution could be read twice In one day and placed on the calendar for passage. S,nator Norrls of Nebraska, member of the agricultural committee, first proposed a concurrent resolution which does not require approval by the presi dent, but other members objected on the ground that such a resolution would not be strong enough. While not anticipating th action of the pres ident. Democratic senators made clear their Intention of voting to override a veto If necessary. The senate committee's resolution declares that unprecedented and un paralleled distress exists among the farmers because of their Inability to maarket their products at prices equal ing the cost of production and that th people of Europe are In "dire need" o these products but not able to purchase because of existing financial condi tlons. The resolution further recite that banks have been unable to extend credit to farmers so they mav ho''" their products until "tbev can be so' In a fair and reasonab'e market." Then fol'owed the resolutions direc tions, which declare: "The secretary of the treasury and the members of the war finance corpo ration are herebv directed to revive the activities of the war finance cor poration and that said corporation be at once rehabilitated with the .view of assisting in the financing of the ex portation of agricultural products to foreign markets. "The federal reserve hoard is hereby directed to take rurh nation as may be necessary to permit the member banks riA the- federal reserve system, In ac cordance with law and consistent with sound banking, to grant liberal exten sion of credit to farmers of the country upon the security of the agricultural products now held by them permitting the rediscountlng of such note of ex tension, at the lowest possible rates of Interest." o Court Decides Villistas Must Remain In New Mexico Prison SANTA FE.

P. Leased Wire GENEVA, Dec. 6. The league of nations assembly today decided to stick to a slow and sure policy in amending the covenant and to extend that policy to the interpretation of the relation between the council and the assembly with regard to their respec tive duties and jurisdictions under the covenant. The Canadian amendment eliminat ing Article 20 and the Argentine amendment declaring that all sove reign states shall be members of the league that do not remain outside of their own choice were referred to a special committee which will study all the proposed changes in the covenant and renort to the next assembly. The question as to what are the i exact relations between the council I and assembly was temporarily and ' partially settled by the adoption oi a sort of working basis in the form of the four ereneral principles enumer ated in the recent report of the com mittee presided over by Mr. Balfour, with certain amendments. The first of the principles which set forth that the council and the assem bly each should be invested with par ticular power and duties and that nei ther should have jurisdiction to ren der decisions in any manner whicb had been expressly committed to the other. Lord Robert Cecil declared must be attended so as to concede to the assembly the right to examine any question within the jurisdiction of the league. He contended that in the principle as expressed the assembly would be unable to treat with the im portant questions of disarmament and mandates and added that his South African delegation would not accept the report otherwise. His amend ment was accepted.

Unless President Wilson changes his plans at the last moment, he will not address congress personally tomorrow but will send a message in written form. It will be read to the house and senate sitting in separate session, as was done with the president's message last December and as was the custom un til Mr. Wilson began the habit of ad dressing congress personally. The president did not make known his intention to a Joint committee of the house and senate which called to day at the White House to formally notify him that congress was in ses sion, but . members of the delegation left him with the Impression that he would not appear before congress i& person.

Lodge, the White House callers were Senator Under wood of Alabama, the Democratic sen ate leade and Representative Mon dell, the Republican house leader. Chairman Fordny of the house ways and means committee and former Speaker Champ Clark. Some of them said the president still gave visible evidence of his long illness, but that considering the character and the du ration of his sickness, he appeared in unusually good condition. He was de scribed as having put on much weight. There was a difference of opinion as to the president's voice. One of the callers described it as "hollow and low," and said that it was with diffi- culty he heard what the president had iu say. wane timers saia ina-i wnue ! not 83 robust as before his Illness, Mr. Wilson's voice was good and that the executive spoke clearly, with only a slight difficulty in enunciation, Washington has been alive for the morrow, taking the opportunity to aripear in public for the first time since he returned "a very sick man" from his league of nations speaking trip in September, 1919. j w..u.i.,. .m wmu Presidents Condition In Doubt t one set oi reports naa it inat tn president would appear in an invalid chair, while another was to the effect that he would walk to the speaker's dais as usual and demonstrate the re- r'eaiea statement oi nis inenas inai his health had been sufficiently re- gained to enable him to get about " ."""-'"' nrvia nr rnp nrpcinunt a manna wora strongly or me view mat ne wouia ao well to take the opportunity to make bis last annual communication to congress for a dramatic appearance in person, revealing his actual physical and mental condition to congress and the country, after 14 months of par- tial seclusion during which he has been seen by few- President Wilson, it is said, was somewhat inclined to take the ODDor- tunity to appear in preson, but other counsel prevailed, it was urgea on the president that no real occasion existed for making a personal journey to the capitol and that he ought not to possibly endanger his progress lo- ward health hy the fatigue and strain that such a record-breaking appear- ance would entail.

Adding a unique page to the nation's history, he attended as a senator the opening of the senate and in a, short address bespoke for the coming four years a spirit, of team work between executive and legislative branches that he expects to insure the highest na tional efficiency in public affairs at home and abroad. Later .after conferences with leaders of both senate and house, he announced that he probably would call a special session of congress soon after his in auguration to attempt a revision of the nation's tax schedules. Both in his private consultations and his address in the senate he asked that the three months remaining to the present con gress be used without attempt at par tisan advantage to clear away routine and lay the ground work for conserv ative legislation after March 4. Foreign relations and the league of nations were discussed by Mr. Harding alone with domestic problems and pos sible cabinet selections in his long 3tring of conferences with senators and epresentatives. The ranking national leaders of his party outside of- congress also were present at the consultations, which will be continued most of tomorrow.
