WAOTHWiTOM, Dec. 12, 1800 The Senate proceedings to-day wore marked by a spirited Southern speech by Senator Wigfall. The repub lican* are in glee over it . ub they say it will rally their breaking forces in the North. Senator Trumbull will not add rose the Senate at pre sent, nor will the other republican Senators, unless the tKle of events ahmiUl present a favorable opportunity. Senator Wilson has a brochure in press in reply to Gene ral Cushing, of Massachusetts. It will appear in a few days, and probably produce a sensation. No New York papers came to hand this evening. In consequence of the train breaking down. The passengers arrived safely. Ttie non receipt of papers creates a great vacuum in Washington intelligence. It Is reported on good authority that an Influential re publican committee from New York will visit Washing ton, to urge upon the republican members of the Com mitlco of States the nect ssity of liberality. The party have as yet made no proposition of reconciliation, nor is there yet any indication they will do so at present. A prominent New York politician declares that the re publicans have already declared war against the South by the indifference of their chief in the present strug gle, and that there will not b<> a Southern State in the confederacy by the 1st of February. Ibc Seaale confirmed John B. Weller as Minister to Mexico. At the meeting of the Committee of States? tb? Chair man, II- n. Tom Corw in, in the chair, and all the mem bers preseut, including Boyee, of South Carolina, except Mr. Hawkius? Samuel Sawyer, of Norfolk, Virginia, a democrat who was Collector of the port under 1'iercc's administration, was elected Clerk. A desultory discus si' n on general matters of no practical business import a dcc occurred, in which several members participated No distinct measures were proposed. The discussion wa of an amicable nature, fending to accommodation, and lasted about four hours. The committee ailjouraed to meet at twelve o'clock to-morrow, when the House pro position will be considered. Private reports from Louisiana speak of that State a< overwhelmingly in favor of seoession. There Is nothing from the South calculated to lessen the excltemcnt, except a report, received through repub ltcan channels, that the agttattoc in Charleston was not so intense. The secessionists think that Senator Wigfall's speech will open the eyes of the republicans, and the republi cans think said speech will open the eyes of their con stituents, and re affirm them in their antl slavery notions. Aflkirsare bec< mlng more snd more ootu plicated, and the factions more and more bitter. It Is believed that if the Senate Committee oould be constituted some measures might be proposed calculated to alluj the excitement and re-rivet the bonds of union. WAmrroin*, D?fl. 12, 1M0.

Washwc,to*, Dec. 12, 1M0. The Superintendent of Public Printing, Mr. Heartt, sent a communication to the Joint Committee on Printing to day, that he bus made a contract with J. T. Crowe!), of Kahway,N. J., for the purchase of Wendell's printing establishment. He agrees to pay one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars for the property, which is said to be between forty -five and fifty thousand dollars less than the original cost of the same. The committee unanimous ly approved the contract At the request of Superintendent Heartt, Secretary Th< mpson, of the Interior Department, authorised an architect to examine the building, and the result of such examination was the full (although unofficial) concur rence by Secretary Thompson in the purchase. Senator Anthony, who is on the Senate Printing Com mittee, and who has been many years editor of the Pro vidence <R. I.) Journal , examined the printing material, and coi> .ilcrs the purchase an economical one for the go vernment. This will do away with tho future disgraceful contests for the printing in both branches. In view of the present complicated state of the public priuting in both bouses, the most politic and reasonable thing to do now is to repeal so much of tho law of the last session as authorizes the purchase of tho above named establishment by the 4th of March next, as the time when it shall go into operation, and provide for Its immediate operation by tho government. At the samo time members of Congress should see to the binding, which is a gigantic plundering scheme when compared w ith the profits of the House printing. Mr. Haskin, who moved the forty per cent reduction on the printing, knew this should be reduced in expense at least fifty per oent. Nearly fifty thousand dollars has already been paid to tin- binders of the House, although they have not yet ac c< mf Wished half of the work that has been ordered. Why Mr. Husk in moved at the last session to reduce tho price ? if printing and nr fleeted the binding, the moat profit able branch, is only accounted for by the fact that the principal binder is his democratic friend and neighbor, and wus Ins (Hasina's) own appointee. If this does not explain the matter, it is sold other reasons can be turnislied. Philip F. Tliomns, ex Governor of Maryland, and now ( < mmissioncr of Patents, was to-day nominated by the President to the S? nate for Secretary of the Treasury, and he was confirmed. This is the second Commissioner of Patents who has been elevated by Mr. Buchanan to a place iu bis Cabinet. There was no nomination for a successor to Mr. Ihomas in the Patent Office sent In to the Senate. Mr. >hngert. chief clerk, will probably succeed him. 1he Senate pMttd the I/>an bill to-day, with a slight amendment restricting the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury, which will not defeat the bill in the House. The llouse to-day found itself without a quorum, but before discovering the fact It buried Mr. Eli Thayer and Ills Territorial policy so deep In the Committee of tho Whole on the State of the I'nion, under the lead of Mr. Grow, that it will take the resurrection trump of a two thirds vote to call him into political life again. Mr. Grow s assurance to-day, that when be calls uphis bills for the < iganizution of the Territories he shall give an opportunity to any gentleman who desires to move to tr.ke out the clause relating to slavery . and that the re publicans will then vote for the bills if tt is the will of the House that they shall puss In that form, gave great confidence to the Southern members that the republicans ntend to show fair play. A Washn pton |*|x r, opposed to Mr. Lincoln's election, aeeerts tn-day that Mr. Don Piatt, of Ohio, who, for a tunc, was Secretary of le gation at Paris under poor Tierce, if to be Uncolu's Private Secretary, and that Mrs. I'on Piatt is to assist Mrs. Lincoln in her duties, at tho White H'use. This announcement is ni.ile without the slightest authority. The statement originally made In the Hkraid is true, that Mrs. Edwirds, a sister ! of Mrs. Lincoln, and a niece of the latter, Mary Wallace a beautiful miss of eighteen, will accompany Mr. Lincoln's family to Washington, and assist Mrs. Lincoln In doing the honors at the President's levees. Mr. Ntcolajr, ihe present coofidmtlal secretary of Mr. Lincoln, will un doubtedly act In the same capacity here. Mrs. I'/lwards to an accomplished Kentucky lady, and has recently been visiting at Andover, Massachusetts. Mr Wigfall's attack upon the Wide Awake organiza tion of the North in the Senate to-day is regretted, as It will have the tendency to irrttaui Instead of allay tlx- preaent netting atate of the public mind.

He eon eluded by asserting that if each State would attend to iU own affaire there would be no trouble. Mr. Tappan, of New York, replied by quoting from the < hirago platform to show that the republicans are pledged against interfering with slavery in the States, and in favor of protecting States against invasion. Henry Winter I avis, of liar) land, spoke in a calm and conservative tone, deprecating the present state of feel ing, and all attempts to dismember the confederacy. He suggested an amendment to the Fugitive Slave law, re quiring Marshals to deliver fugitives to the district Judge in district escaped from, and guaranteeing a jury trku >f dentity, this to be in lieu of l'ersonal Liberty 1' aud a guard against kidnapping. Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, explained the Personal Li berty bills of tbe North, and said they were not in con flict with the constitution, but intended mainly io pre vent kidnapping. He said if the Fugitive Slave law was mod ifled he could recommend the repeal of tho Ver onal Liberty bills. He paid he could not violate his m<v ? al convictions by inserting a provision in the constitu i ion recognizing property in man. Mr. Winslow, of North Carolina, spoke in reply, and cited the hardship* of Southern masters who havo been been robbed of their servants when travelling through Northern States, and especially when about to dcjiart for foreign countries. General Millson. of Virginia, also replied, and com mented at length on tho term "property iu man," and asserted that it was a misuse of terms, and argued that the property which a master has In his slave and his ser vices is the same that a man has to the labor and control of his wife, and that it was as much a hardship to Ray that a slave owner might go into the Territories, but should not take his slave, as to say to a husband that he could go, but should not take his wife. Messrs. Morse, of Maine; Curtis, of Iowa; Kellogg, of Illinois, and Stout, of Oregon, also made some remarks. The committee was quite harmonious. THE 

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM THE METROPOLIS ANI> THE CRISIS. WAsmxiTow, IK*. 11, I860. To Hoy. .Taheh nrxnoxr; ? The undersigned, representatives in Oongreps from the city and State of New Vork.deeni it our duty to com municate to you. ns the representative of our State in the Committee of Thirty-three, to which has been referred that part of the President's Message relating to the con dition of the Tnion, onr views of what, at tbe present crisis of tho I'nion. is demanded alike by the sentiments of our people, the great interests of our State, and the | iroral and political necessities of the situation. We think the time has arrived when an effectual stop ought to be | ut to all aggressive and irritating agitation of tho slavery question at the North. If there are any poiuts of federal relation to the peculiarly Southern institution of negro slavery which give rise to a conscientious senti ment at the North of moral responsibility about it. and therefore to a sense of supposed duty to <ieul with the subject according to theories at variance with the senti ments and convictions of the South in regard to It, we think that those points ought t? he disposed of by con clusive constitutional settlement, so as to relieve unensy c< csciences at the North of that feeling of responsibility, and of consequent supposed right and duty. We think that the South cannot be expected to remain, and that it will not remain, associated in confederation with a Axed anti -slavery majority domination from the North . as we think that in reversed circumstance? our people would not so remain fn a relation of conquered submission to a power manifistly hostile and menacing to their vital icstitutlons uud fundamental rights. We thiuk tliat the South , or even Ibe more southern South ?.f the cotton States, is both strong enough to ufsei t and maintain its independence of the North, atod now, in fact, fully re - olved to do so, unless a Just and necessary satisfaction to Its reasonable claims, and a respectful and friendly reci gnition of its equal rights and the equal sovereign dignity of its constituent Stabs iu the In ion. are now frankly and h>n.tly conceded to it b> tho North, and effectually secured to it by constitution* provisions. We think that there have been reciprocal faults on both sides in the long sectional controversy which has now culminated to its tinal issue and its neces sary permanent solutioa In the now u|>pnrenily alm<?>t inevitable dissolution of the I'nion; but wo also think that thle is no time for recriminations, which little belli true itatesm< n and patriots at such a moment a* the present. And now, condensing Into practical application the views generally indicated in the above expression of not only our own sentiments, but what we well know to be tboec of our people, we think that a more practicable and adequate solution of the now pending crisis of the t'Dtmi would be the nd'ption by tlongre** of cerium amendments to the constitution, in part explanatory and in part new, bat all in barmooy with the pervading spirit of the constitution, and the submission of thuxe amend ment* to conventions or the Legialaturt* of the state*, for ratification, within the courao of the next two month.--. We believe that ?uch amendment* wmiM he ratilled by large majorities in nearly all the State* of the North, and that they ought to be ouJ would be *atisfac tory to the patrtnttr reason of the South; and that by the pr> pi sed course of at tion. if recommended by your committee *nd adopted by Congress, all the prnwent ?torm <>f ilsnger to lb* Cnion will by the 4th m Mure h next have rolled away ns rapidly a* It has swept upon us, and that it will bv followed by u new era of fraternal peace *nd universal pnepenty, which may th. n well justify '>ur confdt nt trust in the perpetuity of this sub lime-t work of human wisdom the constituted tnioQ of th? sovereign States of America.

The Territorial question (In our view of the existing diversity of views, and tho ae< easily of a practicable c? mprt misf on that subject ) would hi wisely settled by a return to that which even from a period long anterior to the date of the Missouri compectniHe wss the fair and sagacious policy of the Inthers, namely ? a climatic par tition, by securing to the South the right of unmolested Immigration into. ?nd settlement in, the Territories sooth of Ike latitude 34 deg 30 unn.

Mr. Hr.vrat said It was an olyi ct to give the n<leH to the lowest bidder. Mr. Anthony, (rep.) of R. I., said let the notes be sold for what they will bring. Tho government should <lcal with all its creditors alike. Mr. Hi'jitkr? We hope the government will be able to pay all its debts.

STAT>. OF THK mfNTHY. Mr. Wioicam, (Opp ? of Texas, rose to S|?e,ik Ho said:? iHirine the talk here yesterday . tlie Senator from Minis (Mr. fouglas) indulged in some patriotic plati tudts en the subject of saving the Union. 1 understood him to say that he was |.r< pat e<l to make any t Hurt in bis power to accomplish that desirable end. He asked for a s|? -citieatlon of the wrongs, or the imaginary wrengs. il at the Southern statis were suffering, or sup p< sed to be RuR'-rinc. I undi rstrnsl him to pledge him sell that when the grievances were made known he would be ready to r? dri them as (ar as laid in his power i mi' i thii state l Ma 1 will state to him one ot the grievances under which the Southern Malts llnnk that they are suffering. It U | that this government has denied that laves are pro perty, aud i.pon t b ? t dtnial ha-' ret used to protect the owners of slaves in their title whenever they were within the lederal Jurisdiction. I have asked Mr. Douglas whether he was prepared to give an assurance that our property would be protet ted witnm the federal Jurisdic tion 1 did not gel a direct ai.swer from him, and I sup pi se that I Will uot do so. He >wys be will show o answer by his vote II a bill be introduced, whethei he will afford prot?ction or not. Will the Senator (Mr. IHiuglas) Interpose by the legislative, Executive or Judi cial de|<artnient to protect that s|iecie?of property known us slaves, as well as every other species of proMrtv W ill be propose amendments to the constitution? Will he vote in this body for amendments to tho couslttuttoor W .11 he pledge in good faith to g > back to the people of Illinois and urge before tie in the ratifli ation of amend ments to the constitution that will vest in the federal government not only the power hut make it aii impera tive duty to protect slave property as it protects every oilier cm s of prof* rty* If he can do this tl en it will ? nd ' ne (if our difficult is Hut to IIiih heauawirs there i* no r> uaon for the exi it?-ni<ut in tin- Southern RUM; that th?y htvf not complained of any tiling. and that tti< - l? i pie there are nut diasai ished.

I think we attach too mu<h im|xirUu>i-e to tti? expression of the galleries. I take It for granted that thise warned yesterday didn't repeat it to day. Yester clay there wan one get, to day there's a new set. We will fit tb< m all instr ucted al ter a while. (Tremendous ap proval fi< m the galleries and laughter from the SonaU>rs ) Mr Wkuuix continued: ? I say that cotton is king, and that cotton waves bin sceptre not only over thirty throe Mates, bi t over the island of Great Britain, and over continental Europe. 'there's no crowned head, either tipin il ut island or the continent tbrt does not bend tlie Wi.ee in fear, and in knowledge allegiance to that power. Fiv# millions of p< pie in (ire.it Britain live up< n cotton. You mi j make gratnand they sui husband it, but exhaust cotton for >ue week iu<i all England will starve. They will not burst op< n barns, l>ut will burn I whole hones. We nan have a dirtel trade of two bun dred and fifty millions to our o An ports, instead of Bos t< n, 1 liiisdelphia und hew York, if wo go out of the I nun. Our imports will amount to two liundrod and til ty millkns.and forty per tent upon that puta into our treasury one hundred million dollars twenty per> ent gives titty millions. What tariff wo will adopt 1 expect to know in a few months, and in another chamber, (laughter In the galleries.) You suppose numbers cou stituie the strengih of government. I tell you it's the almighty dollar. When your operatives are turned out, win n capitalists arc br< ken, will you go to direct taxa tion? When you cea.-e to have exports, will you have im p< rts? Factories will then be burnt down and capitalists go to the wall. I know you don't regard us as in earnest. I would save the I'nion if I could, but it is my deliberate impression, anil I have been studying the character of the people you re present for years past. Now, the question is. am the i nk n be savi d? 1 have always been a I'nion man, suit I am now a I'nion man. not from any silly notion that it is of 1- ivine origin, not that blood was shed for it; not be cai se it s un inheritance from our fathers; for it is nei ther the one nor the otb< r. This I'nion is a compact be tween the Stutis. 1 he inheritance may be regarded the trtaty with tireut Britain and Franco, 'it is a treaty be twem the Statts for a common defence of do nii Stic tranquillity. They agreed to the organization of a certain government. Tiny mado a wise distri bution of the government. They vetted in the State governments powers necessary to protect the liberty and well-being of the citizens. All the States tliat are republican, democratic, monarchical, aristocratic, slave holding, non-slnveholding, agricultural, commercial or manufacturing, can all live under tho constitution its when the old thirteen States ratified und made it binding betwi en tli< m. By the late election it would seem as it the people of the North thought th< mselves responsible for the dunes tic institutions of all the States. They tell us a State has not the right to call out an army and navy or negotiate w ith a foreign power when she Is coerced bv other States. I'o you suppose we can bo amused with clap trap and Fourth of July orators when we feel that we are a nation inheriting rights y 'Ihe pe< pie amongst whom 1 live have passed that point. 1 am a devoted friend of the I'nion, but I km w that it must be dissolved, because I can see no dis [ ? sltk<n to save it among those who alone can do it. V hen the eight cotton States shall withdraw from t h ? I'nion. as tiny will do In the next two months, they will meet In convention, adopt a federal government and es tablish a foreign department, and then I shall advi rate the adoption of tliat same constitution that was ratitiel bv the old thirteen States 1 have no doubt that wh< n tfrgiula, Tenmssee, Maryland, Kentucky anil the other border States see what we have don.1 that they will cotne into our I'nion. and tin n not many months will pass awuy bcTore this beautiful fabi ic w ill again be the scene of our discussions. In wlili h we will not only consider these n .alters pertaining to our domestic affairs, but also iu regard to our foreign relations. Mr . WiurM i here read extracts from the constitution and laws of South Carolina previous to tho inauguration of the first l'rtsidi nt of the United States. Mr. WiusAi i then continued: ? Tb" immediate cause of secession is the election to the Preside ncy of a black re publican. Tlie people of the North must know that the pres. nt state of affairs has been brought about by means of the Helper b<? k, by the teachlugs of the Senator from Niw York (Mr. Seward), by the preachings of the pre t< nded followers of Christ, and by teaching in your schools even the < hildr< n to hate us. Tlie Senator from New York had told bis Wide Awake prirtoi lans that their services could not lie dispensed with after the election, but that they would be needed to secure the fruits of victory. 1 hey are a half a million of men in uniform, well drill ed, snd the purpose of their organ isr tlon is to sweep the country in which I live with lire and sword. Mr. skw.?bi> art se and said ? 1 want to know the ground and plnee where it Is to take place. (1 Aiigliler in the gnllei ies.) Mr. Wkmull said he had seen it reported iu the news papers. Mr. Shw.vsn replied that Ho did not say what was pub lis bed in ii< wspapers. 1 do remember to have read a l< t ler whii h 1 received from si me unknown person of a Southern State, professing to implicate some thing I said in some speech of mine. Bu I can't tell what I may bavo said which could be prr-verted so as to imply I ever said o lilt imated lhal ihe Wide Awakes wcro being kept orga nized, or disciplined, or uniformed, or associated at all to si cure the fruits of tin ir % icU ry. I think I can say safely 1 never said am thing which could. 1 hope the Senator will excuse me? I hope be will not deem it necessary to put m> self under any obligations to oxplalu anything hereafter (Applause. ) Mr Wn?ii i continued, and said the denial of tbe Sena tor is all 1 ask. I only saw a report of his speech. In regard to ihe incomiug administration, It will have oiie-hulf the Senate, the Cabinet and the diplo mats on their side. A great deal is said about this being the land of liberty, and of a p. ople w ho boast that they have a right U> govern them selves. Well, yr.u will nave an opportunity to make tbe i y pel iment. (laughter ) For myself, ['don't believe lhal 1 owe allegiance to the ( lilted States I believe I ? w e alleg ,.nce to my State, and to that State allegiance KbalTlio given.
