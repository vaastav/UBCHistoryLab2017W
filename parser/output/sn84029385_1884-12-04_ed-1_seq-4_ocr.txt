GLiCKis always to be found on the side of the people. The Eeflectob recognizes Gen. Blair to be a highly cultivated, educa ted and honorable gentleman, but if th" portfolio of the Secretary of the Inte rior.is to be given to Kansas it wants the honor conferred upon Gov. Glick, the leader of Kansas democracy. The Governor's record as chief executive of this state; his efforts in behalf of. the people in their fight against monopolies, and his action at Chicago as the head of the Kansas delegation, entitle him to the position. Bro. Hart is still "jim-jams." afflicted with the Butler and Belta dear have sub sided. Unlike Blaine, they know when they've got enough. That rest of four years which our rc jrablicen contemporaries are so sadly talking about may be mercifully pro longed to twenty-four by the democrats. --- ... i .. Uheerful sadness and smiling sorrow are more pitiful and toucliing than a morose or defiant attitude. Hence, our heart bleeds great drops of sympa thy for our republican friends who are talking about success in 1888. Mr. Blaine has been presented with a cane, "the head of which is of beaten gold, inclosing a crystal beneath where in is seen a picture of an olive branch with a dove perched thereon." This gift of peace, sweet peace, following closely after Mr. Blatne's Augusta nightmare, 13 very significant, indeed. i The Kansas democracy may not have given Cleveland any tangible or ma- terial help in securing his election, but it increased its vote fully 50 per cent, over 1880. And Kansas democrats are imitating in a worthy manner their brethren of other states in the patriotic '.rush for office. St. John's total vote will reach about , 158,000. The saint is a man of excel lent parts. He made no mistakes in .the late canvass. He stood for princi ple. Hence his large vote, the effect of which was excellent from a democratic point of view. John Peter is a bright consummate sunflower. Congress convened on Monday and has already settled down to business. Prominent members of the House are of the opinion that no "tariff legislation "Will be attempted during the session. The appropriation bills and land grant legislation will probably take up most of the session, which ends on the 4th of March, 1885. Jt is said that Mr. IjOgan is looking ahead to 1888, and that he doesn't pro pose to play second fiddle to Blaine or any other man. Well, we believe we rather favor JLogan as the republican nominee for President, in 1888. ' He came very near losing his state as a Vice-Presidential candidate, and as a Presidential candidate he would com pletely wipe out the republican major ity in Illinois. The Governor has offered $500 reward for the capture of James A. Pussey, the embezzler of funds of the State Penitentiary. It is unfortunate that this theft should have been committed just as Gov. Glick's term is drawing to a close, but in no .way or maimer can tlie Governor be held responsible for it. It is, however, a darkpot upon an oth erwise bright and successful democrat ic administration. We earnestly hope that the-thief may be caught and punished. High tariff advocates want the sur plus reduced by the abrogation of inter nal taxes on whisky and tobacco. Are the. people of-Kansas in favor of cheap whisky and tobacco, and willing to keep the "necessaries of life at the present high point? The surplus must be re duced and done away with. All agree on that point. And to do that custom duties must be reduced or the tax on whiskyj&nd tobacco must'go. - Here is the dividing line. As Kansas is a 'pro hibition state we should naturally con clude lhat her people would be in favor of a. reduction of the tariff. x Pusey, chief clerk of the Kansas Penitentiary at Leavenworth-, is an em bezzler of the funds of that pop ular institution to the amount of about S4,000. Women and wine are said to be the causes of his downfall. He,was an appointee of the board of di rectors of the Penitentiary. Pussey was popular witli those who knew him, and-if he had been an out-and-out dem ocrat instead of half a one he would never have been guilty of his great crime. If caught, as .we hope he will be, he -will don the handsome regimen tals of the institution he until lately served with so much dignity and eclat Still Snarling at the South. It seems impossible for editor Hart to let up on his senseless, dyspeptic unpatriotic attacks upon the south. Seemingly unable to learn anything, with a heart full of bile, prejudice and hate, he seeks to perpetuate sectional bitterness so far. as his limited power will permit. Fortunately, his influence is confined to a very small circle, and the larger heart of the nation beats re sponsive to the changed and changing condition of things. The noble utter ances of the southern press and people before and after the election are appre ciated by the manly men of the north, who accept them in the spirit in which they were uttered. Closer commercial and social relations between the two sections are bearing their legitimate fruit. The war has long been over; its results have long ago been cheerfully accepted, and in the grand race of pro gress the South is keeping well abreast of the Xoith. Ignoring this state of things, last week's Chronicle frenziedly says: "In the name of all that was fair and decent, why did not the South consider this a re-united country when the war closed? Was ever a whipped foe treat ed with greater leniency? Was any thing left undone on the part of the Kbrth to show a desire .-for peace and good will, and a united, happy and pros perous country?! "j ; The foregoing ;is but a miiu" sample of a long, incendiary article. The ques tions which the "gallant and manly (?)" editor .asks are.-uovt difficult ,to answer. Mr. BLAiNElsXAugusta speech answers them; The republican party has been a sectional party; it has lived upon its heretofore -successful '"efforts to inflame the hate of.theSfortU'againsiitheSquth;J it has traduce,u, anujillifietj- the South and her people ever since the close of the war; the reconstruction period dis franchised the whites and elevated to power ignorant . jiegroes and white- scoundrels or. caj-rjetrbaggers thatpe--riod impoverished i'heSbuth morjs than, the ravages of war; immense' debts were' straddled on the Southern states with out one cent of benefit being derived: When at last, some ten or twelve years ago. the democrats&reTjained, Tcontrol of the "South", Tier people vwere Imdliave been spit uponandtrSated like dogs "by such men as editor Hart. But not withstanding this unmanly abuse, the South continued on theieven tenor of its way;, its material'' and educational progress has been phenomenal; the non producing and non-tax-paying negroes have enjoyed schoql.. privileges equally with the whites, aiiil he 'one great 'de sire of the South was to forget the mem ories of the war and to be re-united in a spirit of generous brotherhood with the people of tho Iorth..Y Is ifrany wonder that the Sorttlhre- joices over the election of Cleveland as being the death blow to all future sectional hate and bitterness? . And is it any wonder that joy that has been in creased since Mr.. Blaine opened the vials of his wrath' and hate of the South at Augusta? But we believe that an era of peace, prosperity, brotherly love and national respect has dawned upon the country; and the sooner the croakers, both North and South, are silenced the better it it will be for the whole country. tion and free trade may thus be turned to good account, that the revenues may be reduced so as to no longer overtax the people, and that protective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome." It will be seen that the President stands almost wholly upon democratic ground. The democratic party has -vr ten a free tcade party pure and simple. It wishes only to reduce the tariff to the needs of the government economically administered; it wishes by wise and liberal measures to encourage the growth of our merchant marine un til the commerce of this country shall be as nearly as possible wholly carried in American bottoms. President Arthur is in accord with this policy, and there-. fore opposed to the high tariff, restric tive policy of the republican party. Capt. Payne Dead. Capt. David L. PAYNE,better known as "Oklahoma" Payne, died suddenly at Wellington, Kansas, last week. His death is of special moment to a large number of persons who looked to him as their leader, and deserves more than passing notice from the people of this state. He was born in Indiana but came to Kansas when not more than 16 years of age. Locating in Doniphan county, he served as a scout during the early his tory of the State and earned a reputa tion for skill and bravery which landed him into the Kansas legislature, where he served his constituents with honor to himself and credit to them. After the war, in which he served with dis tinction, he was elected to the legisla ture from Sedgwick county, and after wards served as Sergeant-at-Arms of the national House of Representatives. The latter years of his life have been identified with repeated attempts to open the Oklahoma lauds of the Indian territory to actual settlers. Possessed of a firm idea that the lands, the fairest and richest on the continent, rightfully belonged to the public, he led several colonies into the promised lani only to be driven out by United States authori ities. Persisting ,in the face of great obstacles and discouragements', which would have overwhelmed a man less brave and determined, he was preparing another attempt, to make his darling scheme successful when death called him away. Capt. Payne was a giant physically, and- honest, brave and generous after 'the; style of tlie' western frontiersman. Although dead, it is to be hoped that his idea -will prevail. The lands he sought to obtain for actual settlers are rich, fruitful and enticing. They are given up to large herds of cattle, owned "by men who pay no? rent but who are growing rich at the qxpense of thous ands of settlers who are waiting for the barriers to be burned away. We are glad to note that Judge Pos ter, of Kansas, has lately'declared that it is no" crime' to fettle, iipon the Okla homa lands. We trust that this decis ion will lead to a speedy opening of that portion of the Territory to actual home steaders. ' ",u j ' V ':' 1 r- '--WW

President Anrnuii's last message has beeu given to the public. It is a comprehensive document, plainness of style and business directness' "being its chief characteristics. It-is just such a statement of governmental .-affairs as would be expected from the President. The relations, of the United States are amicable with all the nations of the earth; the enlargement of our commer cial intercourse with other nations is recommended; a better diplomaticand consular service is needed; the further coinage of silver dollars is discouraged; the restoration of the navy is recom mended, and by liberal mail contracts tho government should encourage the growth of our merchant marine; the In dian policy is endorsed and the repeal of the pre-emption law is asked for-, and the successful working; of the civil ser vice commission is acknowledged. The President comes very near to the dem ocratic idea by recommending that such goods as we do not produce be entered free where reciprocal treaties exist; the removal of tonnage dues and national imports from vessels ph'ing between the United States and other countries, the relief to operate on both sides; the establishment of a salaried consular service as opposed to the present, fee system; the enactment of measures fa voring the construction and maintain ance of a steam carrying marine under the American flag and the establishment of a uniform currency for the countries of America.
