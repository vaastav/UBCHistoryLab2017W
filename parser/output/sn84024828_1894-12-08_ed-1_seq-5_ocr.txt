FREE OF TAXATION IN LIEU OF REMONETIZATION OF BILVER. By the Associated Press. Wahuinqtox, Dec. 3. -President Cleve land transmitted bis annual meiwage to Congress tbis morning. It Is of great length and appears to be made op main- ly of consideration of reports of heads of departments previously madi public, and his views itnd recommendations em bodied in tbem. Ho endorses all of these and in most instances urges their legislative expressions. The most original part of the message is that devoted to consideration of the tariff The message fails to reveal in that part devoted to finances any reference to the so called Baltimore plan adopted by tht Baltimore convention of bankers, and said to have received the hearty concurrence of Cleveland. He deploresthe existing system, especially when it require government main tenanceof the paiitv between gold and silver and urges the adoption of a system of issuing note free from taxation by state b inks as set forth in the report of the secretary of the treasury. Concerning the tariff he says the tariff act pisied at the Imt session of congress requires trapsrMnt amendments if it is to be executed effectually and with certainty, in addition to such nec essary amendments as will no: change rate of duty. I am still very deciJedly (ti favor of putting coal and iron on the free lilt. Sifar as the schedule U concerned, I would be glad under exist ing aggravations to see every particle of differential duty in favor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If, with all favor accorded sugar refining inter ests in our tariff laws, it still languishes to the extent of closing all refineries and throwing thousands of workmen out of employment, it would seem to present a hopeless case for reasonanle legislative aid. And whatever el te is done, or omitted, I earnestly rep-tat rny recommendation that the alditional duty of 1-10 of onecen' per pound, laid upon sugar imported from, countries paying a bounty on its exports, be abrogated. It seems to me, exceedingly important considerations point to the propriety of this amendment. With the advent of a new tariff policy not alone calculated to relieve consumers of our land in the cost of their daily living, but invite the better development of American thrift, and create fov ns closer and more profitable commercial relations with the rest of the world, it follows as an imperative necessity that sua should at once remove (he chief, if not only obstacle.Jwhich has so long prevented our participation in the foreign carrying trade by sea. He then urges American registry be extended to foreign built teasels. Tariff, built u,on the theory that it is well to check i sports and that home markets should bound the industry and efforts of Ameiican producers was fitly supplemented 'by the refusal to allow American registry of vessels built abroad, though owned and navigated by our own people, thus exhibiting a willingness to advance all contracts for the advantage of Ameriran carriage. Our new tariff policv is built upon the iheory that it is well to encourage such importations. Our people's need, and their products and manufactures should find markets in every part of the habitable globe, is consistently supplemented by the greatest possible li wrty to our citizens in the ownership and navigation of ships in which our products and manufactured articles may be transported. Millions of dollars now paid for carrying American passengers and products across the sea should be turned into American hands. Ship building which has been protected to the strangulation point should bo revived by prospects of profitable employment for ships when bnilt, and the American sailor should be resurrected and again take his place as a sturdy and industrious citizen in time of peace and a patriotic and safe defender of American interests in the days of con flint.

New York, Dec. 3 The activity in Wall street was increased by the President's Message, and active speculation was the result. The east hound freight train in charge of Conductor Smyser, was ditched at a point about five miles east of Kingman in the Waliapal Valley Sunday morning. The cause of the accident was a broken rail. The cars were loaded with California wines, raisins, currents and canned goods. The car containing the prodnction of 'he California vineyard was the center of attraction, for some of the many visitors of the wreck simpled the choice brands of port, angelica and claret, and pronounced them most excellent.
