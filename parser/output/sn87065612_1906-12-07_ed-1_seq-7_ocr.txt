THE PRESIDENTS INNUm MESSAGE TO MAKERS Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. INCOME - INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth of Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions. His Views on Negro Question — Asks for Currency Reform, and Shipping Bill—Would Make Citizens of Japs * —Many Other Important Subjects Discussed. Washington, Dec. 3.—The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt’s annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment into law of several bills introduced into congress last winter and spring; his views on the negro problem; the scoring he gives those whom he terms “preachers of discontent;’’ the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the interstate commerce clause'of the constitution, and his recommendation for an inheritance and income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the ones mentioned are by far of the greatest importance. He es pecially urges the passage of the bill f>rohibiting corporations from contribut ng to campaign funds, and also that one which would give the government the right of appeal in criminal cases. Of this he says: “Another bill which has just past one house of the congress and which is ur gently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; It exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It Is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant’s demurrer; while in another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when it oeours, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill in question. A failure to pass will result in seriously hampering the government In its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for ■wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically In view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district judge, against what may be the judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional,” and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion.” Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of in junctions in labor disputes, he says: “In my last message I suggested the en actment of a law in connection with the Issuance of injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions In such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would b wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them in the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. The Negro Problem. The negro problem is given considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country Is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchings, and especially asap - to the negro of the south. He says ae greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago, and by Gov. Jelks„ of Alabama, re cently, and then says; “Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of rape; and it should be felt as In the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in mV judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with in tent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be ■a conducted that the victim need not K wantonly shamed while giving tea timony. and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civ {lization; that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part in the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. “Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be Justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. Capital and Labor. On the subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says “to preach hatred to the rich man, as such, . . . to seek to mislead and inflame to mad ness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to ap preciate the danger in the doctrines preached is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of Amer ican national life.” Continuing on this subject he says: “The plain people who think—the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given pop ular government is to elect an un worthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an Issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it. for in such case dem ocracy is itself on trial, popular self government under republican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man,whether rich or poor, who earnsehis own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog. promising much and performing nothing, or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist, who, for his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of men of either of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America’s past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand in hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law. or who seeks to make them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There Is nothing to choose between such a re actionary and such an agitator; funda mentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even justice to all.” Railroad Employees' Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general In troduction of an eight-hour day, but in sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, “just about as ab surd as it is, so far as the isthmus is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to %vhether the work is done by alien black men or alien yellow men.” He urges the enactment of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902. and refers to the wish of the commission “that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise.’’ Control of Corporations. A considerable portion of the message is devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of inspection on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations bv the federal government he says; “It cannot too often be repeated that ex perience has conclusively shown the im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corpora tions—a control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosures by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the secur ing of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. Asa matter of fact It is these reactionaries and ultraconsorvatlves who are tj l6 * 11 " selves most potent in increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dangerous agitation, which Is 80 per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the agitation is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways is to secure by the government on behalf of the people ejs a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great Interstate com mon callers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote to -the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such Is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain in con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system—or rather no system—of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fall to put a premium upon individual initiative, individual capacity and effort; upon the energy, character and foresight which it is so important to encourage In the individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its extreme form communism, and the destruction of individual character which they would bring about, are In part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results in a single individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all others until his or Its Use effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position of utter inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer In some way to his belief In the necessity for the curbing of enor mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both in come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should Impose a graduated inheritance tax, and, if possi ble, a graduated income tax. He says: "I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful study in order that the people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators can work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that In the near future our nation al legislators should enact a law provid ing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any Individual or corporation. It may be well to make the tax heavy in proportion as the Individual benefited is remote of kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one Individual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object should be to put a con stantly increasing burden on the inher itance of those swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There can be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining the conditions upon which any gift or Inheritance should be received. Kxactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an Incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. Inheritance Tax Constitutional. “This species of tax has again and again been imposed, altho only temporarily, by the national government. It was first imposed by the act of July 6, 1797, when the makers of the Constitution were alive and at the head of affairs. It was a graduated tax; tho small in amount, the rate was increased with the amount left to any individual, exceptions being made in the case of certain close kin. A similar tax was again imposed by the act of July 1, 1862; a minimum sum of 

SI,OOO in personal property being excepted from taxation, the tax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness of kin. The war-revenue act of June 13, 1898, provided for an inheritance tax on any sum exceeding the value of $10,000,/ the rate of tax increasing both in accord ance with the amounts left and in ac cordance with the legatee’s remoteness of kin. The supreme court has held that the succession tax imposed at the time of the civil war was not a direct tax but an impose of excise which was both con stitutional and valid. More recently the court, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice White, which contained an ex ceedingly able and elaborate discussion of the powers of the congress to impose death duties, sustained the constitution ality of the inheritance tax feature of the war-revenue act of IS9B. Is Income Tax Constitutional? “In Its Incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue, an income tax stands on an entirely differ ent footing from an inheritance tax, be cause it involves no question of the per petuation of fortunes swollen to an un healthy size. The question is in its essence a question of the proper adjust ment of burdens to benefits. As the law now stands it is undoubtedly diffi cult to devise a national income tax which shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossible is an other question; and if possible it is most certainly desirable. The first purely in come tax law was past by the congress in 1861. but the most important law deal ing with the subject was that of 1894. This the court held to be unconstitu- U "The question is undoubtedly very in tricate delicate, and troublesome. The decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is the law of the land and. of course, is excepted as such and’loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered to gether with the previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps indicate the possibility of devising a constitutional Income-tax law which shall substan tially acccomplish the results aimed at The difficulty of amending the con stitution Is so great that only real ne cessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in dealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by the national government over the use of corporate wealth In interstate business, to devise legislation which without such action shall attain the desired end; but if this falls there will ultimately be no al ternative to a constitutional amend ment.’* Agricultural Interests. He appeals for every encouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural Interests of the country. He points to the good that is being done by the various forms of grange organiza tions, and says: . . .. “Several factors must cooperate In the improvement of the farmer’s condition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widest possible sense—in the sense which keeps ever in view the Intimate relationship between the theory of edu cation and the facts of life. In all education we should widen our aims. It is a good thing to produce a certain num ber of trained scholars and students; but the education superintended by the state must seek rather to produce a hun dred good citizens than merely one scholar, and It must be turned now and then from the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself. This Is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again and again by all observers most competent to pass prac tical Judgment on the problems of our country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people and to confer more real significance upon the phrase “dignity of labor, and to pre pare the pupils so that in addition to each developing In the highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may together help create a right public opinion, and show in many ways social and cooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business world; and it has accomplished much for good In the world of labor. It is no less neces sary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good In Itself and Is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate business The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological. * Marriage and Divorce. Asa means of bringing about national regulation of marriage andi divorce he suggests a constitutional amendment, and says it is not safe to leave these ques tions to be dealt with by the various states. Continuing on this subject 'he home ties are loosened; when men and women cease to regard a worthy family life, with all Its dutleg fully performed, and all its respoiislr bllities lived up to, as the life best worth living; then evil days for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of ouf population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility Is, from the standpoint of the nation, from me standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death, race death; a sin for which there Is no atonement; a sin which Is the more dreadful exactly in propor tion as the men and women guilty thereof are in other respects, in char acter, and bodily and mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state It would be well to see the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes made happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other cause, and retain his or her self-respect. The president asks for the enactment into law of a shipping bill that will place American Interests on the seas on a par with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication with South American ports. Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are inadequate because of the wide fluctuation of Interest charges, he says; “The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must he ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially impair the value of the United States two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your attention by tho pres ent secretary of the treasury, es sential features of which have beep approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be per mitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital In notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet tho emergency pre sented by times of stringency. He again asks for free trade with this country for the Philippines and in the same connection reviews the work done by this country in the islands, and says “if we have erred in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly In the direction of granting a large meas ure of self-government.” American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan in Porto Rico should be dredged and improved. Tho expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other insular possessions, should all be direct ed under one executive department; by preference the department of state or the department of war. “I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provding for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our in ternational obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States gov ernment are entirely inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible in our international ra tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by the federal government toward this end, and in the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that it is in my bower to do will be done, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully ernplby will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. The city by itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and if inde pendent of this government It would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the United States government. It is un thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed it against the conae-" quences of their own wrongdoing.” Cuban Intervention. The rebellion In Cuba and the Inci dents leading up to the establishment of the provisional government is reviewed, and the president says: “When the election has been held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the imperative need of pre serving justice and keeping order In tho island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed in the island, it is ab solutely out of the question that the island should continue Independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorship before the civilized world for Cuba’s career as a nation, would again have to Intervene and to see that the government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-gov ernment is always hard, and we sheuld have every charity and patience with the Cubans as they tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started It shall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the one hand, and from Insurrectionary disturbances on the other.” _ , Considerable space Is devoted to the international conference of Aiherican re publics and the visit of Secretary Root to South America, and points to the fact that our efforts in behalf of the natfons of that country arc appreciated by On the subject of the Manama he promises a special message In the t^sar futufe.
