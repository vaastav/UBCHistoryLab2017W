HAT President Wilson has vastly added to his popularity by the manner In which he has handled the Mexican situ­ ation is the consensus of opinion among diplomats and officials at Wash ington. Although much still remains to be done and the condition of affairs in the southern republic is still more or less chaotic, where once there were many who feared the outcome of the president's effort to bring about a peaceful solution of the Mexican tangle, now no one who Is in touch with the situation has anything but confidence In the administration's abil ity to handle any problems that the future may unfold. The president's message to congress dealing with the efforts of Commis sioner Llnd to bring about peace be tween the warring factions below the Rio Grande and analyzing conditions there forecasts, if it does not actually cause, the downfall of the Huerta gov ernment. With Huerta eliminated the field will be open for a speedy adjust ment of Mexico's internal affairs in a fashion satisfactory alike to the Mex icans themselves and the United States and other powers. When President Wilson sent ex-Gov ernor John Lind to Mexico as his "per sonal representative" to present to Provisional President Huerta the sug gestions of the administration for a peaceful settlement of the troubled af faire of that country the act aroused much criticism. It was argued that, having no offi cial status, Commissioner Lind was foredoomed to failure from the begin ning. President Wilson's determined stand in refusing to recognize the Huerta government was regarded as an insurmountable obstacle to an am icable adjustment of the Mexican problem, and critics and friends of the administration alike did not hesitate to voice their lack of faith in the pres ident's plan. It was pointed out that with the ar rival of Commissioner Lind on Mexi can soil, carrying with him no creden tials from the Washington government, complications were certain to ensue which might embroil this country in a situation from which it would be diffi- TWSBBfi 1913, by American Press Association. 

PRESIDENT WILSON BEADING MESSAGE. MEXICAK cult to withdraw either with dignity or without loss of prestige. It was even prophesied that Huerta might re fuse to receive any communication from President Wilson's emissary on the ground that he had no standing ac cording to diplomatic usage. Many even went so far as to declare that Commissioner Lind might be compelled to leave Mexico under the "undesirable alien" law of that country. Yet none of these things happened, and the Mexican situation, far from becoming more of a muddle, is now better understood by the administra tion, congress and the country at large than it has been at any time since the uprising which preceded the death of President Maflero. Instead of creating a situation from fc'hich it would have been impossible withdraw without loss of national dignity and which might have led to complications far more serious in char acter, President Wilson has succeeded in restoring the badly shaken con fidence of the powers in the ability of the United States to handle the Mexi can problem unaided and at the same time has demonstrated to the Mexicans themselves that this government has no ulterior motive in taking the role of peacemaker. The president's firm stand in turn ing a deaf ear to the demands of the Jingoes, who sought immediate Inter vention as the only remedy for a con dition of affairs that had become in I tolerable, has also won him a host of admirers in the ranks of those who 'formerly opposed his policies In con press and throughout the nation. In deed, It is now freely asserted that :the masterly fashion In which be has 1 handled a situation, at once delicate 'and dangerous, turning its very dis SS, advantages to profit, will prove to be the most popular act of his adminlstra 1 tlon when Ita history is written.
