While there was entire unanimity of sentiment in favor of the immediate admission of Oklaho ma and the Indian Territory as one state, the protest against joining Ari zona and New Mexico practically amounted to a revolt. A naif dozen congiessmen, headed by Mr. Tawney, ?t Minnesota, who recently visited Ari zona, rcfured to attend a c iucur and were only induced to remain in the chamber by an eleventh-hour switch, assembling the republicans in a "con ference" instead of a "caucus."

I heard over all other propositions which have come before congress this ses ' sion. Speaker Cannon practically forced the proposition through and made a final speech just Ire fore ad ! journment, declaring that a conference : was in reality a caucus, and that for i thirty years ho had never refused to ! be bound by a conference, lie co:i ! eluded by calling attention to the fa mous series of conferences over tiie l force bill and the fact that it had only 'been adopted as a party measure by a '. majority vote cf one. Despite the big republican protest, the impression prevails that the house will pass a two-state bill by a parti san vote, but the big opposition vote in the conference will be seiaed upon by republican senators from the west to justify them in the opposition to joining Arizona and New Mexico' to gether. Not more thtm ten minutes' time was obtained by the opponents of the jointure of Arizona and New Mexico. Mr. Adams, of Wisconsin, who led off in opposition said the opposition to the admission of New Mexico and Arizona as one state was divided into three groups. One believed two states s nould be made of the two territories; anoth er, that neither territory should bf admitted nor the two combined, end SANTA GLAUS ON A WHEEL Can you think of anything more use ful than a good wheel.

Mr. Adams declared that he belonged to the group which was opposed to either the separate or joint admission of these territories. He complained of the manner in which the president had recommended this legislation to congress. General Grosvenor interrupted to say that in this matter President Roosevelt was following the lead of the house, which had declared in caucus for a two-state bill. General Gros venor also denied that 95 per cent of the people of Arizona were opposed to jointure and read several clippings from Arizona papers to prove his con tention. The most ardent advocates of the policy of leaving Arizona to work out her own destiny were not prepared for the sensation which followed the action of the caucus. It is plain that the high handed policy of President Roosevelt and Senator Bevcridge in respect to Arizona is fnr from popular. The events of this day emphasize the state ment I have made in dispatches to the Republican that if the opponents of jointure will work unceasingly they have more than a fighting chance to defeat the unholy scheme which the cneiniea of the territory are seeking to put through.

RANDOLPH. DEBATE RESTRICTED. The Limited Opportunity of the Op- oonents of Jointure. Washington, Dec. 14. The republi can members of the house caucus to day unanimous'.:' declared in favor of admitting Oklahoma and the Indian Territory as one state, and by a vote of 110 to 63 d-dared in favor of ad mining Arizona and New Mexico as one state. Both the statehood ques tions are to be contained in one bill The conference which resulted in this action took place immediately at tha conclusion cf the house session and oc cupied an hour and a half. Opposition to the program was directed against the joining of Arizona and New Mex ico, and it is understood that Mr. Adams of Wisconsin and Mr. Tawney of Minnesota were the only speakers on this side. The program of the leaders was pre sented at the outset by Mr. Hamilton, chairman of the committee on terri tories, in a resolution which he offer ed. It declared it to be the sense of the conference that one stale be made out of Oklahoma and the Indian Ter ritory and one state of Arizona and New Mexico and that the committee on territories be requested to formulate this plan in one bill. The Hamilton bill, already introduc ed, contains the necessary provision to meet this plan and will undoubtedly be the measure reported by the commit tee. Hearings on this bill, on the question of embodying a constitutional amendment prohibiting the sale of liquor in the two territories, were be gun today. Aside from this question the bill i.T practically in shape to re port. The liquor hearings will not be hurried, and the Xlan now seems to be to delay the reporting of the bill until after the holidays. When it Is re ported a rule will be brought in for its immediate consideration by the house. The conference had not proceeded long when the debate was limited to five minute speeches, and this action caused complaint by those who are op posed to the admission of New Mexico and Arizona. Mr. Cannon took the floor and spoke vigorously for the two state plan. Af ter Adams and Tawney had opposed it, Grosvenor of Ohio took opportunity to read a number of newspaper clip pings giving an account what he term ed the "junket" which a number of members of the house had taken through the territories last summer, at which time they publicly stated they would oppose the admission jointly of Arizona and New Mexico. Joint statehood was favored by Rep resentatives Smith of Iowa, Powets and Littlfield of Maine and others. Mr. Lacey secured a division of the reso lution and when both of its parts had been adopted. Chairman Hepburn on being requested to rule on the reso lution, stated that the resolution might be taken to have been adopted in its entirety; that one bill must contain a statehood measure for two states and that there be no division of the ques tion. PETITION PRESENTED. Washington, D. C, Dec. 14. (Spe cial.) Delegate Smith of Arizona pre sented a petition today from the Bap tist convention held in Tucson against the joint statehood bill.

HEARD Center and Adams Streets. 3S2S5 INSURANCE AND CANAL The Principal Topics of Dis cussion Yesterday Id the Latter Much Opposition to the President's Views Was Brought to the Surface. Washington, Dec. 14. The senate spent four hours today in discussing the Panama canal emergency appro priation bill and when it adjourned the bill was still under consideration. There were some speeches by Messrs. Teller, Scott and Morgan, and they were followed by a general debate in which all phases of the controversy were exploited, including the question of salaries, the control of the Panama railroad and the necessity for general legislation on the canal subject. Sen ator Allison, chairman of the commit tee on appropriations, expressed the opinion that congress should take up the question of salaries in connection with other canal legislation. He also said that the status of the Panama railroad should be made the subject of legislation. Messrs. Teller, Scott and Morgan ex pressed satisfaction with conditions in Panama, but all indicated a determin ation, to support the supply measures necessary to secure construction of the canal as at present undertaken. Mr. Teller advocated a sea level canal; Mr. Scott spoke in support of the San Mas route as preferable to all others and Mr. Morgan expressed an opinion that before the Panama canal is com pleted, another canal will be recessaiy to do what business required. A separate bill regulating the Issu ance of bonds for the canal and plac ing them on the same basis as other bonds of the government was passed without debate. During the day Mr. Rlklns made the statement from the committee on interstate commerce, expressing the opinion that the committee would pie sent a report within a reasonable Wme. Mr. Teller concluded with a plea for a wider and deeper cajal than that had been decided upon by the canal commission. He also indicated a pre ference for a sea level canal, admitting that its cost would not be less than $100,000,000 but contending that such a canal would better meet the demands of the world. Mr. Scott expressed an opinion that a mistake had been made in selecting the Panama route, and made a speech advocating the San Bias route. "We are now confroeL -with- jtrst sach a situation as I have always held would be encountered in connection with the Panama route. We expended millions of dollars and are now no nearer to the competition of the enterprise than when the United States took control of it." He contended that the canal could not be constructed as a lock canal within less than ten years, nor as a sea level canal in time to serve this generation. Mr. Scott concluded with the statement that he would not op pose the appropriation for the canal but he expressed an opinion that if the investigation recommended by him three years ago had been made the San Bias route would have been chos en and what he termed the present complication would have been avoided. At the instance of Mr. Aldrich, the senate inserted an amendment extend ing the incidental expenses of the com mittee's provision limiting the expen ditures of tiie appropriation. The sug gestion of the amendment led to a dis cussion as to the authority of the commission to make contracts. Mr. Culberson called attention to Secre tary Taft's statement to the effect that under the terms of the Spooner act the commission has authority to con tract for the construction of a canal, and Mr. Allison expressed an opinion that the commission has now power to enter into contracts, but that expen ditures could not be made except as appropriations are made. Tillman made some inquiries regard ing responsibility for such contracts, and expressed the opinion that under the circumstances we might at some time find ourselves "in the cloud or in air." "In clouds or in air?"' asked Mr. Al lison. ' "More likely in mud," insited Mr. Tillman, "for I think we are more likely to be stuck there. Who is to judge of the wisdom of such con tracts?" he asked. "The president," responded the Iowa senator. "Suppose he made a mistake; then we would be required to pay the ex pense," Mr. Tillman urged, and Mr. Al lison replied, complacently: "Very likely." Mr. Morgan took up the thread of Mr. Scott's remarks in favor of the San Bias route, expressing an opinion that in view of the divided opinion of the engineers on the Panama route, it would be wilse to order an immediate survey of the San Bias route. "I would welcome it as a happy solution," he said, and he added that the location of the route is an ideal one. One of the greatest recommendations in its favor he said is the fact that there is no Spanish population at either end of the line, and that the country travers ed is unpopulated. In this connection he discussed the president's declaration favorable to the Panama canal, and said: "This is tak ing time by the forelock in a very strenuous way. I do not, know how others may feel when told by the pres ident that the canal must be built at a certain specfiied place and at no other. For myself. I don't feel com fortable." Mr. Morgan said that he had been misquoted as having said that there had been graft in connection with, the mangement of the canal and quoted what he said. "If," he added, "any graft has occurred, it will be found in connection with the Panama rail road." Speaking of the Spooner law, Mr. Morgan expressed the opiniom that, properly administered, it is a wise and patriotic measure, but he added that its operation had been "thwarted by the determined opposition of the presi dent." He criticised the present bill as being a pretenfe because it does not reduce salaries as the result of the "presi dent's liberality, generosity or extrav agance." Mr. Morgan expressed! the opinion that by the time the Panama canal is completed the business would be so great that another isthmian canal will be necessary, and he contended that no canal should be permitted in that vi c'nity unless under the complete con trol of the United States. 

INSURANCE REGULATION. Washington, Dec. 14. The debate on the recommendations in the president's annual message regarding insurance regulation occupied the house again today without conclusion. The pend ing resolution refers to the question of the ways and means committee, and in its defense, Mr. Payne, chairman, made the argument that the only way congress cculd control insurance was through the taxing power. To this many objections were made. Members said congress could not afford to take the position that the only way congress could control insurance was by taxing it: that it should reso lutely pursue other methods of con trol until some way wa found which would be efective. The liberal rules of the debate allowed lengthy speeches which went off on other subjects in tended for home consumption aind ap plicable to particular localities. c 

MIDDIES MUST 60 RESULT OF HAZING The Nary Department is Determined to BreaK it Up. Washington, Dec. 14 Hazing of every kind, it was announced today, would be stamped out at the naval academy, regardless of the number of dismissals from the brigade of midshipmen nec essary to bring about this result. Two midshipmen will be dismissed from the academy within a few days by the secretary of the navy, one for hazing and the other for countenancing it by failure while on duty to report its oc currence. Other dismissals will fol low as often as midshipmen are found guilty of hazing or countenancing it. Aroused by the condition of affairs, which reports show exist at the acade my so far as the treatment of fourth class men is concerned. Secretary Bonaparte this afternoon telephoned to Bear Admiral Jas. H. Sands, super intendent of the academy, requesting him to come to Washington as soon as possible for a conference. This con ference will be held tomorrow Admir al Sands arriving here on an early train from Annapolis. It will be the initial step in the new and vigorous campaign to be waged at Annapolis against hazing. Admiral Sands will have the unqual ified support of the navy department in his efforts to abolish the evil and Sec retary Bonaparte today announced that the admiral possessed the full confi dence of the officials here in his ability to handle the situation to the entire satisfaction of the department. Con gressional investigations of the condi tions at the academy have already been proposed in a resolution introduced In the house by Representative Loud of Michigan. SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. Washington, Dec. 14. Secretary Bonaparte received a report from Ad miral Sands, superintendent of the na val academy at Annapolis upon the hazing of Midshipman Kimbrough. Ad miral Sands recommends the summary dismissal of Midshipman Tremore Cof fin, Jr., third-class and Midshipman Warren A. Van Doren, tecond class. It can be authoritatively stated that if it is in the power of the navy department to stamp out hazing in any form at the academy it will be done speedily. The circumstances of the hazing which occurred on Tuesday night are as-follows: The victim was Midship man Jordan E. Kimbrough of German town, Tenn. Last week he was called before the . board of officers now in session at the academy inquiring into hazing, fighting and similar practices and compelled to answer certain ques tions. It is said that he had also told some relatives that he had been hazed and that his relatives laid the matter before the authorities. The hazing on Tuesday night was on account of these two things. Midshipman Kimbrough was com pelled to stand on his head then on his feet and then on his head again, re peating this process ten minutes con tinuously. At the end of that time he fainted and was left in that condition by the hazers. Later he was found by his room mate still unconscious. The next morning he was carried to the hospital. Admiral Sands, had the matter in vestigated by a board of officers the next morning. Their report showed that Midshipman Trenmore Coffin, Jr., of Carson City, New, member of the third class took part in the hazing and that Midshipman Warren A. Van Dor ver of Mount Holly, N. J., of the sec ond class, was on duty and did not re port the occurrence. Admiral Sands immediately suspend ed the midshipmen and forwarded his recommendation in the matter to the secretary of the navy. He would not state what this recommendation was in advance of its receipt by Secretary Bonaparte, but it was understood to be for the dismissal of the midshipmen implicated. THE HAZED ONES RECOVERING. Annapolis, Md Dec. 14. Mldshlp manKimbrough tonight is reported to be gaining strength rapidly and that there is no danger. The condition of Midshipman Cooper is alfo improving. Admiral Sands will go to Washing ton tomorrow to support his reeom- mendatk:i for dismissal in the cases of Midshipman Coffin ar.d Midshipman Van Devere. Dr. Geo. Van Devere of Mount Holly, N. J., fafier of Midship man Van Devere, does not regard the dismissal of his son as just and will fight it before the secretary of the navy, and in case of failure there, probably before congress. INSURANCE CONFERENCE. State Authorities Asked to Meet at Chi cago in February. Washington, Dec. 14. Thomas E. Drake, superintendent of insurance for the District of Columbia, has address ed a circular letter to the governors, attorneys-general, and insurance com missioners of all the states and terri tories inviting them to attend a con ference to consider questions relating to insurance, at Chicago, Thursday, February 1.

PRICE OF WHEAT. The Figures Fluctuated Throughout the Day at Chicago. Chicago, Dec. 14. Trading in the wheat pit today was quiet and prices fluctuated within a very narrow range. Iu:ing the first half session sentiment was inclined to be bearish, although the news of the day was of such an in definite character as to be of little value to either the bulls or the bears. A slight decline in the price of wheat at Liverpool caused a depression on the local board at the opening, the May option being Unchanged to 14 lower at SS. An Increase in primary receipts brought out some selling to ward noon, and the price of May eased off to 884. Late in the tlay leading bulls came into the market and because of their purchases the market harden ed. The close was firm with the prices at the highest point of the day, the final quotations on May being up at 88. The volume of trading in corn was extremely small. The market closed firm with prices up Wli, May at 44I gi. Oats were steady. May closed unchanged at 32. The active d?ni:nd for lard and ribs created a firm mar ket. At the close May pork was up 5c. Lard gained 7V4 and ribs were 2t to 5c higher. THE ADVANCE OF TIN. A Further Gain of $5 in the London Market. New York, Dec. 14. The upward movement in the London tin market continued today with prices showing a gain of about 1 10s for the day. Spot closed at 1.65 12s 6d and fu tures at 164 5s. The local market was firm; spot SCfTi $36.40; copper also advanced in the London market with spot quoted at L60. 12s. 3d. and fu tures .at-.fi 70 12s 3d.

Santa Ana, Cal., Doc. 14. In re sponse to resolutions represented to the state's representatives In Wash ington endorsing Roosevel!.'s position in ra'lroad rate legislation, Santa Ana merchants have received expressions from Perkins and Flint, and from Congressman Smith of Bakersfield, de fining their positions on the question. Senator Perkins says: "I am in full sympathy with the views expressed by President Roosevelt in his last message to congress. I am also in favor of passing the most stringent laws against the railroad companies giving i special rebates or privileges to ship pers. In other words, I believe all should be placed on equality when shipping in carload lots. I also favor the enlargement of the Interstate com merce commission, so that the west and California especially may be rep resented upon that commission. I hope that congress will agree upon a bill and enact it into a law that has the approval of the president and in ac cordance with the wishes of the people of the country and especially Califor nia." Senator Flint's non-commltal reply Is: "I have no dcubt that a bill will be passed during the present session of congress that will prove satisfactory to you and your organization." Congressman Smith endorses Presi dent. Roosevelt's stand in the words: "I am in hearty sympathy with Presi dent Roosevelt in this matter."
