COLD, HARD, CRUEL WINTER, MUSED THE FRIARS But Winter Means Snow, and Shovelling Means Jobs, and Jobs Mean Money Ergo, They Dined the Mayor. Tho ab-w-lutely on the level reason that tho theatrical men's urganizatlon selected Mayor Mltchel ns their guest of honor at the Friars big blowout In the Astor Sunday evening came to the surface only yesterday. Heretofore the Friars have always had ns their chief gutst a mighty producer. like Freddy Eddie McKay or tome other internationally known stage person. Most nctors nnd even many producers now are seeking vainly for Jobs. A word from the Mayor and there are nlwi-yn Jobs, from snow shovelling down, to bo had. And thorn you are. Consequently there'a a lot of looo talk going around that several Lambs want, that organization to fall In line. Now's tho time, they argue, for tha Lambs to give even n bigger dinner for Governor elect Whitman, All of which, bv the war. suggests some nfterthoughts about that Friars dinner of last Sunday night which could not be squeezed Into type Mondnv morning Inst owing to the necessity of teportlng tho Mayor's remarks, llrlef ns the Mayor's speech was, It contained so much of Inter est to theatregoers that the report of It crowded out many other meaty Items. During the dinner, for Instance, the pleasant smiles on the face of Kdwln Waistcoat riunti ns he hovered around the press tables telling the reporters snappy little yarns nbout "It Pays to Ad vertise." "The Miracle Man," "On Trlsl," "The Miracle Man." "Hello, Itroadway," "The Miracle Man" for some reason V.. Waistcoat seemed especially Interested In "Miracle Man" storle and other ntttrac tlons he Is all wrapped up In were forced smiles, nil of them. Mr. Dunn was smiling In spite of the fact that ho was overwhelmed through out the festivities with a great secret sorrow. George M. Cohan, who Is asso ciated with Messrs. Dunn and ItarrlH In the show business, got up the nerve be fore the dinner, It seems, to suggest to H. WalstcoRt that Mr. Dunn set aside his electlvlsm Georgle'H very word In clothes for the evening nnd appear at the dinner all dolled up correct anil proper. "May I suggest, Mr. Dunn," concluded Georglc, "that for the nonce you tie n can to all those new vesta you've had made from the Turkish tugs In our late lllg Idea.'" It's an awful thing suddenly to hate torn out of your life your favorite scram bled eeg proof waistcoats. Nevertheless, E. Wnlstco.it capitulated and Hit evening tried to feel comfortable In a modlshl correct white waistcoat decorated with streamers of purple wistaria nnd pink rosebuds running across th white goods In diagonal stripes.

"Did you ever see Diamond i Jim Hrndy sit through even one whole course at a dinner without suddenly Jumping up to shake bunds with some dame who's Just entered one of the grand I ballroom boxes"" i "He's always doing It. And did you ever see him wear morn cracked Ice and mineral displays than he did last Sund iy night? 1 tried to keep my mind off busi ness, but every time Diamond Jim got up and began to wedge Ills way betwien the tables I kept right at his elhow frn force of habit.
