PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Summary of President jlcKinley ^lossage to Congress. Thc third annual message to C gress of President William Melvin submitted to that body December I is the longest document yet issued the President. Thc message will tract widespread attention becaus* deals with the new conditions brou about by the accession of new te tory resulting from the Spanish An ican war, and because it will bc garded as the plea ol' the Republl party for the support of the Amerii people in the presidential election next year. That the message is int esting throughout and is well wo reading, despite its great length, th is no doubt. It is given in full, w for word, in The Journal to day, mainlines are summarized below: The president begins by stating tl on the threshold of the deliberalic of Congress the members are call upon to mourn with their countrym the death o:c Vice President Hoba paying tribute to che worth of t :'<r dead statesman. The president next declares unqu ifiedly for the gold standard. On-tl momentous question, he says: "I urgently recommend that to su port the existing gold standard and maintain 'the party value of the coi of the t >vo metals (gold and silve: and the equal power of every dollar all times in the market and in tl payment of dehts,' the secretary the treasury be given additional pow and charged with the duty to s< United States bonds and to emph such other effective means as may 1 necessary to these ends." Mr. McKinley next discusses tl subject' of an American merchat marine, and earnestly recommenc that steps bc taken by Congress i encourage and aidintheestablishmer of a great marine, seemingly endor ing the proposed ship subsidy mo vt ment without raying so clearly. Perhaps there is no greater surpris in the message than the President' . reference to the trusts. He plac? his administration squarely in opp( sition to *he combinations of trade On this s jject he says: "Combinations of capital organize into trusts to control the conditions c trade among the citizens, to stifi competition, limit production and de termine the prices of products use* and consumed by the people, are just ly provoking public discussion am should early claim tfhe attention o Congress." Coming to the Transvaal-Britisl war, the President seemingly rebukei in no uncertain tones the recent utter anees of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain British colonial secretary, and Mr Joseph Choate, United States ambas sador to England, proclaiming thal this country and England are practi cally in alliance. The President re affirms the time-honored doctrine that this country shall remain free from entangling foreign alliances. He says: "This government has maintained an attitude of neutrality in the unfor tunate contest between Great Britain and the Boer States of Africa. We have remained faithful to the precept of avoiding entangling alliances as to affairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that the par ties to the quarrel would have wel comed any kindly expression of the hope of the American people that war might be averted, good offices would have been tendered." Coming to the acquisition of Porto Rico and discussing the Cuban ques tion, the President dv ells on the des tiny of both countries, recommending the establishment of a civil govern ment for Porto Rico as rapidly as pos sible and the raising of the custom duties on exports of that island. He declares that the island of Cuba, which is temporarily under the protection of the United States, must be turned over to the people of the is.'and as soon as a stable government can bc formed, reaffirming the purpose of the government declared prior to the Spanish war that the people of Cuba would be given their freedom and the yoke of Spanish rule swept away. He says this pledge is of the highest hon orable obligation and must be sacredly kept. Then he speaks of the intimacy which must exist between America and Cuba and of the destiny of the is land, declaring we must protect the people. The President relegated the Philip pines question away to the rear of his message, but it can be clearly discern ed that he intends what he says on this subject to be regarded as the most important part of the document. He begins on the question by referring to the treaty of peace between Spain and the United States signed Decem ber 10th, 1898, by which Spain ceded to this country the Philippine Islands in consideration of $20,000,000 and peace. He declares on this ques tion: "The islands were ceded by the government of Spain, which had been in undisputed possession of them for centuries. "They were accepted not merely by our authorized agents in Paris under i the direction of thc executive, but by ; the Constitutional and well considered action of the Repr?sentative? of the people in both houses of Congress. I had every reason to believe and I stili believe that this transfer of sovereign ty was in accordance with the wishes and the aspirations of the great mass of the Filipino people. "On the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of the forces of occupation was instruct ed to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we came, not as invaders cand conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employment and in their personal and religious rights.' " "It is enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he was prom ised independence by any officer of the United States in return for his assist ance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by the very wit nesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent leader hoped for ?vheo he came to Manila was the liberation of the islands from thc Spanish control, which they had been laboring for years without success to throw off. "The future government of the Philippines rests with the Congress of the United States. If we accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions, a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we desert them, we leave them at once to anar chy and finally barbarism. "We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them unquestioned. "Their rich plains and valleys would be the scene of endless strife and bloodshed. The advent of Dew ey's fleet in Manila bay, instead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress, will have been the beginning of an era of misery and violence worse than any which has darkened their unhappy past. The suggestion has bern made that we could renounce our authority over the islands, and giving them indepen dence, could retain a protectorate over them. This proposition will not be found, I am sure, worthy of your serious attention. Such au arrange ment would involve at thc outset a cruel breach of faith. It would place the peaceful and loyal majority, who ask for nothing better than to accept our authority, at the mercy of the minority armed insurgent. It would make us responsible for the acts of the insurgent leaders and give us no power to control them. It would charge us with the task of protecting them against each other and defending them against any foreign power with which they choose to quarrel. In short, it would take from the Congress of the United States the power of de claring war and vest that tremendous prerogative in the Tagalo leader of the hour.-Atlanta Journal.
