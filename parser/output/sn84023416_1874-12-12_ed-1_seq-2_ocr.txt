The btc elections li.ive called out various opinions concerning the cause of the Democratic success from politi cal writers anil speakers, as well :.s from various Liberal-Democratic-Republican-License Law men, who scarcely ever read or write, but arc always speaking, and arc of late mo:e than willing to charge corruption and fraud on the Republican party, that wo feel like giving them a ghnce nt the other side of the picture, by call ling their attention to the following copied from an exchange : We bear so much since the fall elections of the return to power of the old Democratic party that it may be well to recall the fact that the last heiid of the organization as a nation al parly was during the administration of IVesident Buchanan. On the lClh of January, 18G1, Mr. Morris, a Dem ocrat, spoke as follows of the last Democratic Administration of which we have any record : 'Tw years ago 1 propose i to bring articles of impeachment against the President; my own convictions prompted me to do so, but I allowed ityself to be persuadud to do other wise. The fact, sir, is no torious that corruption has been rank in all the Executive Departments of the Government, that they lay around ns a mass of moral and political pu trefaction, that from the highest to the lowest they have plundered the public coffers poisoned the channels of na tional virtue, prostituted to unholy purposes the highest obligations of patriotism, tarnished the national honor and destroyed the national credit." This is not a crayon sketch by r.n opponent, but the honest utterance of a Democrat who told the truth. W are not aware that the Democratic party has ever shown any signs ot re form since the days of Buchanan. The same old leaders arc now coming to the front, and Fernando Wood will be vindicated for all he has suffered in the holy cause of Democracy. Congress met on Monday, a goodly number of members being present. A few bills were introduced and tabled to await the appointment of committees. Very little has been done, and it secins as though Con gress is a little uncertain what is best to do. The President's message oc cupied the attention of Congress awhile the first day. He advocates an early return to specie payments, and opposes inflation. The message is rather more lengthy than usual, treating on the various topics of the day. The New Hampshire Prohibitionists met the 2d instant and nominated a full State and Congressional ticket, and instructed the State Central Com mittee to call Councillor, Senatorial and County Conventions. ISathunicl White, of Concord, was nominated for Governor, receiving 71 of the 90 votes cast, and David Ilcald of Mil ford was nominated for Railroad Com missioner. Rev. A. C. Hardy of Portsmouth, Josiah M. Fletcher of Nashua and Edward XI. Weston of Whitcfiell were nominated for Con gressmen in their respective districts. William F. Ilavemycr, Mayor of New York city, died very suddenly of apoplexy while attending to the duties of his office, on Monday last. Mayor Iavcincycr was about 70 years of age; was a straight forward, honest man, and possessed the confi dence of his people. He had been thrice elected to the office of Mayor. Notes from tlie Hub. The following communication was intended for last week's issue, but failed to reach us in season. Ed. Montpemer, Nov. 25, 1874. The gavels of the presiding oflicrs of the two Houses fell at precisely 8 this taioniing and thus ended tho second biennial session of the Lcgis lature of 1874. Its work is done the future nlone can tell how well the test will show how wisely, ami what was left undone. The Hall looks lonesome this forenoon although the scrapers are busily engaged in clearing up the "bits" and emptying the desks of the departed, consisting of large bundles of bills, cards, notic es, in vitalions.tcports, advertisements, etc., which the out goers considered worthless. Many little round paper balls, which wire quite forcibly pre sented to the pates of some members, especially those distitute of hair, dur ing tho small hours of last night, for Bomeof the members felt particularly funny anil the more sedate would have to "elongate" when I oholding some of the antics of certain ones near the lobby. The principal business of last night's session was to clear the Speak ers desk of bills reported adversely by tlif various Committees, and also to elect a Speaker to fill the vacancy oc ensioned by the election of Mr. I'ow cm lo no an Assistant Judge. At eleven, P. M.,tho canvass commenced oryutber tho voting. The leading candidates were Mr. JommIi Grout, of Newport, and Mr. Dana, of Cornwall, j the contested ram, the luttor having had a large field for observation at Washington and o1im being strong in body and voice, quick, u.l well adapted to thg place, wasA trough; ursied bv bis friends, but ihff way be came killed him. There were several olhcreandidates, but on the fourth ballot Mr. Grout was elected. Mr. Grout is not strong but is clean and tlevcr, ami if he had a stronger voice would servo admirably. The Hall and the whole Capitol was densely packed during the evening, many members giving their scats to the ladies. At midnight a lunch was served in the General Cwtntniltee room, to all the member?, by the Scrgcant-at-Arms, after which there wa3 a mock session of half an hour. Wellls, of Granby, served as Speaker, and filled the place most ad mirably, as the frequent peals of laughter would attest. Next was wit nessed one of the most lovely acts of of the session. The members had thrown in tacit- mites and purchased a silver service, which was brought in while the speaker was at lunch. In a shortjkiud'yjeiVijr speech, Mr. Mason, of Manchester presented the service to him in behalf of the members, Mr. Powers in ti few loving and tsiidcr words expressed his thanks for that most tender rcgird and esteem that was down deep in his heart for the members of the Legislature of 1874. And, now was the time to rush through their little jobs, and although re peated effors were made to reconsider votes, and to work up some "partic ularly necessary" cases, not one sue cecded, for enough of ths stern good sense of the House remained to snuff out all jobbery at once. Very many warm friendships were made here which will continue through life. There has been always good feeling and good will among all the members all most earnestly maintaining the rights of each other, no malice in de bate, no revenges, and very peculiarly touching and kindly were all the good byes and invitations to visit each other. Observer. For tho Essex County Herald. Ministers' Wives. Society is concrete intelligence, an indefinite, aggregate humanity of "large expectations." It expects the "good time coining," progress in nil that is good and great, and an unde fined amount of servico from the wives of the pastors of its churches ; forgetting, meanwhile, that these same ladies have a lively interest in the good times coming and would like to make a little progress on their own hook. A pastor is hired lo preach to a respectable church for from S300 to $1,000 a year, depending on the wealth of tho organization and the expensiveness of living. This is poor pay for well Iraiued and indus trious brains, but it kccp3 body and soul together, though the library stands a poor chance for reinforce ments, and the children for toggery. This hires the pastor, but somehow or other people have an idea that it hires the pastoi's wife as well. From the day she enters the parish she is a marked woman. Her dress is expect ed to be of tho most saintly pattern. The color of a ribbon may endanger the peace of a whole community and the sporting of a feathar may call for the sci vices of an Ecclesiastical Council. She must bo 'the best wo man in the world the head of all be nevolent cnterprizes, Sunday schools, ladies' fairs for procuring flannel shirts for Hottentots, sewing circles, Bible classes. She must be the polit est person in the world, receiving calls at all limo3 anil visiting from house to house, and make herself generally agreeable. She must be the most ex emplary woman in the world, never laughing above the prescribed key. In short she must be tho paragon of all excellence, and possess a constitu tion like a horse, patience like an ox, good nature like a puppy, to meet the wishes of what Carlylc would prob ably call the expectational epoch in the Sublime Cosmos. And why? Simply because her over-worked hus band has consented to do a most im portant, a most holy work, for under pay. We appreciate fully the desir ableness of having, in the w.fe of the pastor, a pattern of feminine proprie ties and Christian virtues, as much on account of the pastor as tho people ; but we protest against the too com mon notion Mint the pastor's salary makes tho wife a missionary, who is to labor with equal assiduity nnd earnestness for the good of the pn Ir ish, nnd to "cotton" to tho caprices, tastes and prejudices of the parish without a farthing's consideration. She has her household duties to per- lorm, and we know not why more. could be expected of heir than any other Christian woman who has the care of n family, nnd a toiling hus band to look after, comfort and con sole.

Dear IJeruLl: This in the third Utter I have bi nn to you. nnd l)o)e this time I shall: finish it. IOng ago, to have sent you on account of the city nnd its inter resting points would have been far easier than now not that there was more to tell every day one sees more to tell, but in time it grows common place, and while a stranger sees enough '.hit interests him and of course would Interest friends he is writing to; but the best worth mentioning, soonest is an every day matter, end he thinks it not worth mentioning. The approach of winter makes one wish for the land of pleasant homes, for such New England emphatically is. It is true we have lo work harder, longer days and more days' work for a plainer living than do many in warmer tlimer, and many luxuries others have we do not get; but best of all is the lovo of home, friendship of neighbors and the long winter evenings of comiort that we have. This i3 not my opinion alone. It was most strongly dwelt upon by a native of the West who once spent a winter m Essex county, that never did she see so much solid comfort taken by people anywhere as amid our deep snow drifts. Whether it is that man enjoys best what costs him most, ami our home comforts cost us more work, or that we find less to en joy away from home, or from some other cause, I cannot say. But in New England and among New Eng land pnople everywhere I have found the happiest homes I have ever seen.

UCIC US 1 Hail HO idea till I saw it. Stores and busi ness places are almost uuiversally closed, and everyone looks to the day for enjoyment aid a big dinner. But to many of tho residents of a great city it is a far different day from that at home where families and friends arc reunited, A great pait of the young men have no real home to go to. Many board in a greater or smaller sort of human stable, where lliey are kept for the money and givpn so much care and attention as that money will command. Others a class perhaps not smaller hire a room somewhere, the rent including furniture and care of the room. There they sleep ami pei haps spend more or less of their spare hours as they feel inclined. Then for meals they go to some board- uig-houvc, restaurant, or hotel, cat what is set before them, or if at a restaurant, what they call for, asking no questions for conscience' sake. When this is the way that a large por tion of young men hcie live, by far the larger portion, if we exclude those brought up here and still at home, is it any wonder that hoffle tastes, love for a pleasant, quiet place to spend their evenings, love for improving and good society, in fact, in a home, is it strange that nnrr'iRse is froin"; out of fashion and crime, or at least. viciou3 ways, common ? More and more I see why the city is the abode of evil and those brought up in it so often take their place in the lowest classes it contains. Were all replen ishment from the country cut off, our cities, instead of growing at a rapid rate, might even fail to maintain their present size, and honor and honesty would be even more strangers here than now. I do not of course- mean that no children grow up in cities, or growing up never take honorable po : sitions ; but that the place is not favorable to their growth in numbers propoitional to the people as in the country, nor to cultivation of the best traits of character; at least, so it seems to one not accustomed to the sights, scenes and roitow here.
