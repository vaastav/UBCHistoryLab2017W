TURKEY STUFFING Christmas Dinner Incomplete With out This 01 dFashioned Addition The latest and most obnoxious crank in th gastronomic line is that I deluded epicure who asserts that I Christmas turkey must be served without stuffing lIe says It is anI I anomaly a thing without reason an insult to the completeness of the bird He even declares that it de tracts from the sweet flavor and deli cate aroma of the king of fowls Thus he thrusts himself into the pub U arena a most unwelcome butter in striving to accomplish the down fall of an historic institution lIe 1I 1 I not a true American He has never tasted stuffing as mother made it the real Simonpure article spooned out of the deep recesses of the royal bird in great crumbly masses that fill the room with rich aroma and the heart of man woman and child with Joy unconfined s It is the soul of the turkey is stuff ing With tho bird Itself one is al ways bothered about what part he will have whether white meat or dark whether a ving a thigh or a drumstick whether the wishbone the liver or the part that went over the fence ast1 but for the stuffing American sentiment is universal Tho only question is How much does one dare to eat And then that en trancing cagey odor from the mys terious yarbs that enter into the mak lngus sweet as the summer breezes over new mown hayas delicate as the fragrance of orange blossoms on a wedding day And perchance In addition < ve shall catch the sublime suggestion of an onion wafted into our quivering nostrils and recalling some dear departed maternal spirit who ministered to our boyish wants In days of yore Turkey straight without stuffing Not while there is breath to sound a protest It Is the mission of civiliza tion to mix with naked nature the toothsome miscellany of tradition to blend the work of nature and man to sweeten with our best endeavor the plain blessings of an allwise Providence Thats what gave us stuffing and until the heart of man grows cold until the race loses its teeth and lives on pills and tablets and predigested pap its multitudes will insist on turkey as mother served It Down with theories Give us stuffing or take the turkey back THE UNCONVENTIONAL SARAH I It was Thomas Carlyle who said that all genius was akin to savagery Sarah Bernhardt exemplifies this in the buodolr of her chateau In Paris Mme Bernhardt Is a perfect barbarian In her defiance of nil the convention alities regarding color schemes Her sleeping room Is hung in royal purple decorated with peacock plumes Over her Louis XVI bed is a canopy made of un spun silk taken directly from the silkworm cocoon A great splash of crimson satin In the form of a shield adorns the center The walls are hung In old tapestries and In the Interstices of the hangings are row after row of tiny monkey skulls the eye sockets of which are illumined with electric lights lightsThe divine Sarah has parted with her pet tiger and now has for a com panion a large and ugly baboon whose ears have been pierced so that they may carry huge rings of solid gold Bemhardt is said to look as young as she did twenty years ago Her face Is without wrinkles and her step is as spry and her manner as vivacious as when she first electrified her natlvo city as an actress FORTUNE FOR A ROSE A WONDERFUL NEW VARIETY WHICH BRINGS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS Is a Ravishing Pink and Crimson Tea One to Two Hundred thousand Dollars Expecte OtherHuge DollarsExpectedlrufltOtherHugeFigures Figures for Mowers A Washington gardener has origi nated what Is believed by expert flor ists to be the finest rose ever grown the Queen Beatrice It is a tea of a peculiar shade of pink with a touch in the bud of light crimson Its par ticular merit lies probably in the fact that none of the beauty of its coloring i is destroyed either in natural or arti I ficial light Added to this it has a fragrance equal to if not superior toI I that of the American Beauty The rose grows on straight and stur dy stems from two to three feet long I its parents are the two wellknown va Mr Kramer Is n Washington florist with large experience in the flower line many new and interesting nov elties having originated in his green houses Among the popular garden roses which he produced are the Climbing Meteor a climbing varie ty with largo red blooms Champion of the World Robert E Lee F H Kramer and many other sorts which have been sold to catalogue houses < and named by them He has just originated the Climbing Ameri can Beauty which will probably be listed by flowersellers next spring He recently exhibited in Washington the F H Kramer carnationa deep pink sortwhich many wellknown florists have declared to be the equal of either the Lawson or Fiancee He states that no plants of the Queen Beatrice rose will be ready for distribution before the spring of 1007 during which time a large sum of money will be expended in the erection of hothouses and the cultiva tion and growing of hundreds of thousands of young plants The es estimate f THE NEW QUEEN BEATRICE ROSE I ricHes Liberty and Madam Chatenay the former one of the most popular crimson varieties but uncertain in the production of perfect blooms Queen Beatrice has none of the faults of its parents and combines all of their good qualities it is resistant to insect and mildew attacks and capable of forc ing on the hothouse bench Grown at Gardiner Hubbard Mansion It was originated by Peter Blssett byFlorist Florist P H Kramer of Washington Blssett Is the head gardener of Mrs Gardiner Hubbard the widow of the late Gardiner Hubbard at one time president of the National Geographic Society She is the motherinlaw of Alexander Graham Bell the Inventor of the telephone Tile new rose was produced at her beautiful suburban residence Twin Oaks Just outside of the national capital The leading florists of tho country have known of the existence of this rose for a year and have made various tempting offers for it but it remained for Florist Kramer to offer 30000 and finally secure tho beauty Such a fabulous sum for a rose seems insignificant however when it is remembered that but a few years ago Thomas Lawson of Frenzied Fi nance fame paid 30000 for a mere carnation while the greater amount of 125000 was expended for the Fi ancee carnation It is hinted that Mr Lawson cleaned up over 100000 out of the Lawson pink and the buy ers of the Fiancee carnation easily doubled the amount expended Origin of the American Beauty And yet the American Beauty of whom every flower lover Is fond has a very very sad history A number of years ago a Washington gardener who made only a specialty of garden roses received from abroad a ship ment of plants among which was a mongrel This with out of door cul ture produced very largo and fragrant blooms It attracted the attention of Thomas Fields a Washington florist Nothing was known by him of tho forcing qualities of this rose In the greenhouse but as he rathor liked Its color and general appearance one af ternoon while her husband was ab sent ho purchased the single plant from Mrs Ready for five dollars Ready when he rotured and was told of tho sale believed that his wife had asked too much for the flower Fields experimented with the plant and found thntlt exceeded oven his fondest hopes Ho named It the Am Honn Beauty and probably cleared 25000 on this one deal Todny Ready Is still a gardener doing odd Jobs for peo pie around town spading up gardens supplying rich earth and planting shrubs or 200000 will be made from this flower Attempted Grafting Various artifices have been tried by clever but unscrupulous people to ob tain specimens of the Queen Beat rice rose many coming into the Kramer establishment where a huge bouquet of the blooms was on exhibi tion offering to purchase at largo prices a single flower for a bouton niere Others have gone so far as to order elaborate funeral designs with the proviso that nothing but this par ticular kind of rose be used These were only dodges to obtain the healthy wood for slipping and growing for the best time to make rose cuttings is either just before or immediately after the plant comes into bloom One Washington florist who origi nated the Ivory rosoa handsome white flower and a sport of Golden Gatewas unwise enough to sell cut flowers thereby enabling the purcha sers to propagate the variety cheaply The Washington Florists Club re cently awarded the new Queen Beat I rice rose a certificate of merit the I first of the kind ever given by the j club The new flower is so striking and beautiful that every member of the club consented to the awardI I Comfort on Uncle SamsI I Ample Breast Cupid is one of the best recruiting I officers that Uncle Sam has confided one of tho sergeants attached to theI I
