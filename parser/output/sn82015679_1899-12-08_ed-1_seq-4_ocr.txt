It seems difficult to make the average Ohioan believe that an Ohio man is really anxious to give up an office with a good salary attachment The suggestion that the Constitution be Bo amended that no polygamist shall ever hold a federal office would prevent future contentions about such cases a3 that of Roberts, When an Indiana representative beginning tls third term In the House Is selected to take charge of the currency bill In that 2ody the value of keeping men of experience In the House can be appreciated. Mr. Roberts told members of the House, after It had sent his case to a committee, that he had no comment to make on its action, -which Indicated that he is a prudent man. It is time to rail at the court after conviction. ...... The school teachers in Shelby county Who passed a resolution denouncing ths war in the Philippines are attracting some attention, but it is not of a character that t . - - ...... would lead them to repeat the silly per formance. - Taken in connection with recent criminal and political developments in Kentucky, it Is Interesting to note the moral point that Bluegrass representatives cast four of the thirty-one votes In favor of the seating of Brlgham Roberts. There Is said to be considerable opposi tion to Mr. J. S. Clarkson for secretary of the Senate because he has for some time been a lobbyist, and because he is interest ed pecuniarily In several measures now pending before Congress. It Is rumored In Pittsburg that Mr. Frick and. Mr. Carnegie are out, and that the former will retire from the management of the Carnegie iron Interests and become the director of a strong opposition which will be a competitor. If this report is true It means that two powerful combinations will compete for the iron markets. Some of the later dispatches from Ma nila indicate that the Filipinos were not so nearly vanquished as It seemed a week ago but this assumption should not lead the anti-imperialists to Indulge In any hope for the success of Agulnaldo or any other person composing "the glorious trinity" of the champions of the cause of the insur gents. . The Boston Journal, noting the Intemper ate speeches of members of the Massachu setts Reform Club regarding the President for his Philippine policy, calls attention to the fact that while the leaders in that or ganization have been schooled in the most famous of American universities, the rec ords of the association show that every public policy which tho club has opposed lias been adopted by the American people. The declaration ": of Governor Jones, if 'Arkansas, in favor .of expansion may be re garded by. the senator of the same name from that. State, as being in the nature of a fire In the rear. Before the season is over there will be so many such declarations that anti-Imperialism will not be a popular issue with Democrats, even If their candidate fchall be "one of the glorious trinity" that has fought for the cause of the Fili pinos. ' The, statement made by Mr. Evans, chair man of the Council committee on fran chises and contracts, relative to the work being done by the committee in considering the relations of the gas companies and their consumers, will be read with Interest. Mr. ' Evans explains that the task before the committee 'is a most onerous and per plexing one. to which it has been giving the best attention of which It is capable. It is true that consumers of natural gas have suffered and are now suffering from a scant supply of the fuel on which' they are so wholly dependent, and It is also true that the winter Is well under way, demand ing as prompt action as possible In reach ing a settlement of this much-vexed ques tion ;ibut it is also true that what is wanted Is a sensible and Just conclusion of the committee's investigation, one that will af ford relief to the customers of the com panies instead of adding to their troubles. The statements made to the committee by the gentlemen representing tho Consumers Trust are entitled to decent consideration, and necessitate a' very careful Investiga tion. While this should be made with as great dispatch as is possible consistent with a just consideration of the question, it is far better that whatever adjustment Is finally agreed upon on tho part of the committee, should be one that will settle the matter fairly, once for ail. than that conditions shall be created that will work no relief- to the public. . . . 7 -The Republicans , are going to prevent the payment of bonds In silver dollars," Is the remark of one' of those small politi cians who have not yet learned that the word "bond" has lost Its efficacy as a weapon of demagogues. The United States, the State, the county and the city issue bonds because the people want the money. Moreover, a bond of the United States never was redeemed In silver. It has never been the money of large transactions. Un til the passage of the Allison-Bland act there never were sufficient legal tender sil ver dollars in possession of the United States to redeem one ten-thousand-dollar bond. As a matter of fact, a Democratic Congress, years ago, the House of which had an Indiana Democrat as its loader, put the United States on the gold basis by changing the coinage ratio, and a subse quent Democratic Congress demonetized all the silver 50 and 23-ccnt pieces by reducing their weight and limiting their legal ten der. At the present time States are seek ing to refund their indebtedness In gold-Interest bonds bearing a lower rate of Inter est States whose officials are Bryan men. A few years ago, when sllverlsm dictated the action of Congress, it refused a propo sition to issue a 34 per cent, gold bond, and thus compelled the Issue of a 4 per cent coin bond Instead. The intelligence of the country has had enough of that sort of statesmanship. 

IMMEDIATE ACTION DESIRABLE. The action of the caucus of the Repub lican members of the House in approving the financial bill of Its committee, and the purpose to take the bill up and dhpo?e of it before the holiday recess if possible, will meet the hearty approval of the vast majority of men of both parties who be lieve It Is wise to put the currency of the country on a gold basis and to secure the treasury against the danger of an "endless chain." It will give the business of the country fresh assurance to have prompt action by the House. It is cause for con gratulation that there is no disposition on the part of the Republican majority to delay action, and much less to betray ir resolution. The measure Is essential to the well-belnj of the Nation; such being the case, the Republicans In Congress should act with promptness and without any hesitation regarding consequences to the party, organization. Nothing is lost by doing tlie right thing and doing It because It is the right thing. Senator Teller and others of those who are sincerely attached to 16 to 1 declare a purpose not to attempt to delay the Re publican measure declaring for the gold basis. On the contrary, if the senator speaks the sentiments of the sllverites, they are anxious to have the Republicans furnish them with an Issue, since Mr. Teller and other Senators confess that there will be nothing of anti-lmperlalisn long before the national conventions meet. Let the silverites In the House be as sensible as Mr. Teller and permit tho Republicans, he says, to emphasize the money Issue, and thus give them an excuse for insisting upon the free and unlimited coinage of sil ver. It is said the Republicans propose to assign a week for debate of the caucus bill tcfoie a vote is taken. That is ample time for debate, and much more than will be devoted to what, under any stretch bf cour tesy, can come under that head. Tihe week before the holidays, if devoted to the pas sage of the currency bill, will not be lost, as it would be under ordinary conditions. THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET. It may be questioned If any of President McKinley's predecessors has ever had a Cabinet composed of men front" the first to the last any better qualified for the dis charge of their duties. There have been Cabinets in which there were exceptionally able men, but the conspicuous ability of a part of their members served to emphasize the mediocrity of others. A man better qualified for secretary of, state than Mr. Hay could scarcely be found in the country. Education, ability and experience fit him for the position, and that fitness is recog nized abroad as well as at home. Mr. Gage was recognized as a financier of large ca pacity before he was called to the treasury. Without political experience when he ac cepted the responsible position, the knowl edge and training of a man familiar with and successful in extensive business opera tions prepared him for the discharge of the duties of secretary of the treasury. In all his official reports and addresses ho has displayed a familiarity with monetary af fairs which is obtained only by experience. Mr. Gage takes rank with the ablest men who have held the position he now fills. The report of the secretary of war, as well as the executive vigor displayed by Mr. Root, mark him as a man possessing high qualifications for any position requiring accurate Judgment and decision. Governor Long has proved an able man ih several positions which he has filled. He is an ex cellent secretary of the navy, sustaining the high reputation of such predecessors as General Tracy and Mr. Herbert. Charles Emory Smkh has brought to the Postoffice Department the ability and the purpose to Improve the postal service of the oountry. If Congress will but accept his advice the postal service will be greatly improved and will pay its way. The other members of the Cabinet are abie men, against whose official conduct no criticism worth notice has been made. They have not had large experience in political affairs, but they have won In private life the distinction which has warranted their selection. The reports of all these officers have shown that they are qualified for the positions they hold and are giving attention to their duties, and It may be safely said that they are so managing affairs in their departments as to win the respect of the country. With the President, the Cabinet Is giving the country a. business administration. One of the most Important measures pre sented In the Senate came from Senator Culloni, and directs the secretary of war to correct the record of and to grant an honorable discharge to all soldiers who were at any time in actual service of the United States, and who have more than thirty years been held to have been In eligible for such honorable discharge by reabon of any charge of desertion which may stand against them. The bill Is in the nature of a general amnesty for soldiers who were unable to have thtlr records cor rected, and will permit such veterans to se cure pensions. There Is reason to believe that the fore going announcement will cause a very gen eral expression of indignation. It Is prac- tlcally a proposition to make the pension roll other than a roll of honor. Veterans who went through all the campaigns and can name men who deserted will regard this proposition as an Insu.t. since It makes the Infamy of desertion the equivalent of faithful service. For, years the government had a commission for the purpose of re moving the charge of desertion against all those who could show reasonable cause for so doing. When this commission closed its work It was fair to assume that all those who could clear themselves of the lpfamy which every good soldier attached to deser tion during the war for the Union, had either done so or did not regard an honor able discharge of sufficient Importance to make application for reinstatement on the rl!. If "-r I to bo amnesty for desert ers that they may get pensions, honorable uncharges should be sent to the heirs of those deserters who were shot or hanged for desertion while the war was In prog ress, to the end that all may receive the same treatment. Some very vigorous pro tests will go to members of Congress against Senator Cullom's bill. The advantage of the so-called Reed rules appears in the programme of the Republicans for the passage of the cur rency bill. By virtue of those rules the consideration of the bill can be deter mined with the days for debate and the time for taking the vote. Under the rules of the period when Mr. Carlisle was speaker a bill could Scarcely be taken up until It should be reached on the calendar. When once before the House a small mi nority, by filibustering, could prevent a vote being taken for days or prevent Its pas sage by pursuing dilatory tactics until the majority, weary of the struggle, yielded. In the early part of 1SS0 there were 60,873 telephones under rental In the United States; in the latter part of 1S0S there were 1.124.MS. with nearly 1,200,000 miles of wire. In there were 1,225 miles of wire under ground; this year there are &S.1S4. It is estimated that the total number of connec tions made between points in the same ex change on the last day of 1S93 was 3,823.070. If the exchanges of one day should be mul tiplied by 265, an idea of the amount of tel ephone talk can be obtained. In addition to such use of the telephone, S0.C00.00e ex traterritorial messages were sent in 1S38 between towns.

DECEMBER MAGAZINES. A new story by Booth Tarkington begins in the current number of McClure's. It is entitled "Monsieur Beaucalre," and Is a story of English life of the last century, entirely different in style from his "Gentle man from Indiana." With its Christmas number Harper's Magazine begins Its hundredth volume and enters on the last six months of its fiftieth year. Its half century has shown a con tinual progress in mechanical and artistic if not of literary features, and of literature it has had the best that was produced. Probably it has never published a hand somer number than this Current issue, which may be regarded as a typographical culmination of fifty years' effort. The Art Amateur for December is a Christmas number. Its color supplement is a direct reproduction from the original "old master," the "Virgin and v-hild." by Raphael del Colle. The chief illustrations have a bearing on Christmas, Including "Christmas Lettering," Christmas decora tions, etc. There is the usual variety of practical features, and the "Note Book" gives the important art news of the day. The Amateur Is an excellent magazine. An art organization at 033 Fine Arts Building, Chicago, Is Issuing, semi-monthly, a set of prints to meet the demands of public schools for reproductions of famous and classical pictures at a low price. The prints are five by seven inches in size, each portfolio contains ten, and sells for 10 centH, making the pictures cost 1 cent each. Port folio No. 7, one of the recent isuues, is de voted to Raphael, containing his Madonnas, his cartoons for frescoes, his "Cherubs," etc. The same organization publishes the monthly magazine for schools, Arts for America. The first chapter of Rev. John Watson's (Ian MacLarens) "Life of the Master" Is given in the Christmas number of McClure, The editors announce that this Important work was written at their solicitation, they con&idering that Dr. Watson combined, in an almost ideal way, the spiritual Insight, experience, literary ability and scholarship which the work demanded. The work will be illustrated and will be continued through the year. An important statistical paper in this number treats of "The Aiovement of Wheat" the sources and vol ume of production, the machinery and methods of distribution. Two historical ar ticles, one dealing with the removal of Stanton from the War Office, the other with Col. John Laurens, of revolutionary fame, for its theme, are readable features. Two or three short stories and Tarklng ton's serial make up the number. The New England Magazine celebrates the season with a gay holiday cover. With in there is less of the holiday flavor, but an abundance of good reading, neverthe less. The first descriptive article, which Is also profusely Illustrated, relates to "Old Boston In England." "Canterbury Cathe dral" Is the subject of another English pa per. An Interesting paper treats of the old fashloned formal box-edged flower gardens, relics of the colonial time, a few of which are yet found In northern Massachusetts. "When New England Was Rebellious" and "BrookfieUl and West Brookfield." are titles of other contributions. A little out-of-door sketch. "My Farm in Winter." by John Al bee, will be read with pleasure by those who know something of the charm of the country in winter. "Is not winter a lone some time in the country?" he asks, and answers his own question: "No. not if you have eyes and ears and a few neighbors, the nearest of whom are perhaps no far ther off than the stars." Several poems and stories of good quality make up the number. In the December number of the Forum nine of the eleven articles treat of sub jects relating to current events and exist ing conditions. Responsibility In Municipal Governmcit" contaln3 the plan of Prof. Hyslop. of Columbia University, for the tetter government of large cities. After de ploring the Inefficiency and corruption of administration In all large cities and boldly declaring that a large part of the voters are unfit to have a voice in municipal af fairs, he presents a remedy, which Is a civil-service court, which shall be the cen tral source of responsibility for all munici pal affairs, shall have the power of re moval, without appointment, the court to be appointed with long tenure, rather than elected. Of course, no magazine of the high character of the Forum would be complete unless the trust question received some sort of attention In each issue. In the De cember number Professor Bemls is given a dozen pages on which to set forth "the real nature of the trust, which he falls to do. If the public relies upon such men as Prof. Bemls for instruction regarding trusts, it will remain Ignorant. The North American Review for Decem ber surpasses the usual excellence of this magazine of the longest and most varied existence. Like Its equally ale competitor, the Forum, the Review gives its first pages to the historical causes of the war in South Africa, which' is worthy of consideration, because its author is James Bryce. This eminent publicist regrets. If he does not condemn, the course which the British Ministry has pursued. In the next article. Karl Blind shows that European opinion is hostile to the British. He also shows that Mr. Chamberlain was opposed to war in 1M6. There are three other articles upon phases of the war in South Africa. Some Consecrated Fallacies" is the subject of a vigorous article in which the author, Amos K. Flske, argues that there was no reve lation of universal and eternal truth in the "glittering generalities" with which the framers of the Declaration of Independ ence prefaced their Justification of their separation from Great Britain. He goes on to show that the application of these gen eralities or consecrated fallacies is gro tesque, when applied to' all conditions of people. "A Possible Anti-British Alliance was written before the German Emperor visited Queen Victoria, but it reveals the French hostility to Great Britain. The Magazine of Art for December (Cas sell's) is a very handsome number. Ameri can art periodicals 'suffer many vicissi tudes; they arise and nourish for a time and then are heard of no more, but this English monthly goes on from year to year with its chronicles of British art and keep ing pace with modern progress In typogra phy and reproductive processes. The work of C. Napier Hemy. a marine painter, is given esrecial attention in this number. The biographical sketch is accompanied by numerous illustrations from his work, and the frontispiece of the magazine, a fine photogravure, is after one of his paintings. Among other full-page Mlustratlons Q tho number is a reproduction in color of a sea sketch. American readers of the magazine will examine with Interest the photograph of the statue of Oliver Cromwell, lately erected in the garden of Westminster Hall the first statue of the Protector ever placed in England. The picture sustains the assertion that the sculptor was deeply interested, not only in the figure he was modeling, but In the man he was celebrat ing. Other subjects handled in the number are "The Van Dyck Exnibition at Ant werp," 'Decorative Art at Buckingham Palace,". "Joan of Arc in Art," "The Art Saes of the Season." and "Recent Acquisi tions In National Museums and Art Galleries." CANNOT INSURE INFANTS COMPANIES MUST FIRST HAVE AU THORITY GRANTED DY STATUTE. Auditor of State Receives an Opinion on the Question from the At torney General. Auditor of State William H. Hart recent ly submitted the following question to the attorney general: "Has an association, organized under the assessment law of Indiana, passed March 1807, and doing a life insurance business on the assessment plan, the right to issue benefit certificates on tho live. of infants, and thereby transact the; business of what is cefmmonly known as industrial insur ance?" "If it Is unlawful for the association to do so, at what age does a person become eligible to membership in such associa tion?" Attorney General Taylor has prepared tho following opinion on the question submit ted: "The question which you ask is not a new cne. The statute of Indian referred to Is very similar to Chapter 173 of the New York acts of 1SS3, and also to the Penn sylvania statute for tho Incorporation of beneficial societies. . Under these acts. It l as been held that. Unless the authority to insure Infants is expressly granted by stat ute to assessment, mutual or fraternal ben efit associations, such insurance Is not within the power of the company. The Insurance of Infants, unless directly au thorized by law, is not permissible, for three reasons "1. Such companies are governed and controlled by their members, and can only insure members. An infant Is, for obvious reasons, incapable of becoming a member of such company. This has been repeatedly decided. "2. The parent or other relative of an Infant has no Insurable interest on his life. "3. An infant is .incapable either of enter ing into a contract for insurance or au thorizing another to make such a contract. As to Infants under the age of discretion, applications for Insurance cannot be made by the insured, and to permit insurance cn one person's life to be written on the application and for the benerlt of another without the consent of the assured and without legislative authority is, and has always been held to be, against public pol icy. "It is, therefore, my opinion that an as sessment company organized under the act of 1S97 has not the right to Issue benefit certificates on the lives of infants. As to your second question, as , to the age at which a person becomes eligible to mem bership in such association, it is decided in both the New York and Pennsylvania cases, and is unquestionably the law In Indiana, that Insurance cannot be written by any person under a law similar to that of 1K97 before the Insured reaches the age of twenty-one years." CURTIS WILL RETURN. Light Artillery's Captain Will Take Churge of Prise Drills. The distinction between the Indianapolis Light Artillery and Battery A.'of the Na tional Guard, Is becoming more pronounced In the efforts of the members of the later organization to have Capt. James B. Cur tis's leave of absence changed to a bona fide resignation, in order that a new cap tain may be chosen to command the bat tery. At the time Captain. Curtis left the city for New York it was , understood he would resign from the battery, but later it developed that he had been granted an in definite leave of absence. This occasioned but little comment, as It was felt that per haps Captain Curtis might decide to return to this city, in which event he would be In valuable to the battery. A few days ago a letter was received, however, saying that he had found conditions to his liking and had acquired a lucrative practice in New York, and this made It apparent to mem bers of the battery that Captain Curtis would not return to Indianapolis, and that therefore It was necessary that a successor should be named for his place. In the meantime the members of the Indianapolis Light Artillery, which is tho "drill com pany" within the National Guard company, and entirely separate from the Battery A organization, Insist on retaining Captain Curtis as the leader of the "prize-drill" organization, and have received assurance from him that whenever necessary he will come to Indianapolis from New York to command the company on such occasions as prize drills or social functions of any kind. THE BUSINESS DIRECTOR. John E. Clelutid Selected by Xevr School CommlMloneri. A meeting of the five members-elect of the new Indianapolis School Board was held yesterday in the office of Commissioner Moore. It was decided to appoint John E. Cleland as business director at a tentative salary for the first six months of $175 a month, with the undemanding that if the duties of the office are sufficient to war rant a greater compensation it will be irf creased to $2,100 a year. He will take u.s office Jan. 1. as will Harry Wright, who. It Is understood, will be retained as cus todian of buildings 'at a salary of 51,200 a j-Bar. ..... FOR WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE MEETING OF THOSE WHO ARE AGI TATING THE GREAT PRINCIPLE. Miss Sasan D. Anthony Speaks nt Day and Mglit Meetings Pro gramme for To-Dny. The meeting of the National Suffrage As sociation at Plymouth Church last night was welj attended. To the surprise of many who were In attendance there was an ad mittance fee of 10 cepts charged at the door, but this was explained by Mrs. Chap man Catt, national org.-.nizer of the asso ciation, who said .that the association was held responsible for the rent of the church and incidental expenses arising from the meeting, and that It was necessary that a small sum should be charged In the even ings for the purpose of defraying these ex penses. The. evening's programme was begun with an address by Dr. Dewhurst who said In part: "My part In this evening's meet ing is the function of the maid who comes to the drawing room door and announces that dinner Is served then quietly with draws. We are usually .Interested In the dinner and not In the maid so in view of the address from the distinguished women present this evening you will permit me to announce that the feast is served. A gath ering like this finds its interest and attrac tiveness for me principally because it is a part of the great struggle of universal forces. It seems to me rather msdlaeval that any responsible and worthy human be ing should be disinherited and disfranchised for any arbitrary reason. I am of those who think that the evolution of state and of society will yield the suffrage to women Just as It has slowly yielded it to men. The principle of democracy is sure to dis solve at last all the lumps of unreason and prejudice that are the inheritance of bar baric ages, and meanwhile I suppose we all need to comfort ourselves In the midst of our special Interests, by recalling and ap plying rigidly the words of a great teacher which have in them a profound philosophy, Say not. Lo here It Is. but behold the King dom of God is within you.' " Dr. Dewhurst was succeeded by Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, who said In part: "We belong to a great association wnich shall live as long as time; we want en franchisement for we believe that women will add a great moral responsibility at. the polls. It will develop the women to give them this responsibility, and consequently the men will be morally developed on ac count of their association with them. The question has often been asked. 'What kind of a husband has the woman suffragist? and I am sorry to say that we women are almost universally accused of having idiots for husbands or else we are sour old maids. I would just like to ask why this shoulu be so? I know that we are accused of having underdone bread and overdone beefsteak and it Is said that our children and hus bands are neglected, but you and I know that all of this is untrue, and I guess the only .thing we can do is to consider the whole thing as a joke. When we ask for suffrage, they think we want something; that we want to hold office of some sort, but this is rot so; all we want and all that we hope is that sometime we may be able to occupy such positions as a woman should occupy. It has been said that we are a very irreligious set of women, when the truth is that we are Just as religious as any one. We are very much encouraged be cause we can see a great improvement since this great movement began. I re member when it was considered to be sin ful for the women' to sit with the men in the churches, for It was customary for the men to sit alone in order that they might think of God instead of their sweethearts and wives. Not a thought was given to the sweethearts and wives, as it did not make any difference who they thought of. but now we can all sit together and I guess that is a sign of improvement." 

NEED OF WOMEN EVERYWHERE. Miss Anthony then addressed the meeting on "The Need of Women Everywhere." She said. In part: "Every business interest in this country is now controlled by men, but the other interests which do not have a financial basis are left to the women. All of the work done In the churches, with the exception of the help from a few trustees, deacons and ministers, is being carried on by the women; in the schools all the teach ers are women, with the exception of a few college presidents, superintendents and principals. The great trusts representing the financial interests of the world are rep resented by men; their attorneys are men; their trusted agents who lobby in the halls of Congress, to see that no harm comes to them by reason of any legislation, are men. If the women of this country would seek to influence the legislature they would not have a particle of influence, they would be bowed down and out, with the promise that their request should receive proper consid eration, and all of this because they have not a vote behind them,. There Is one class of people who can get what they want In this country and another class that cannot get anything. It Is perfectly unphllosoph ical for any class of men, be they minis ters, teachers or any one else, to approach a politician unless they have something back of them. Of course, while women are powerless to assist in legislation they have no responsibility, but that is not what the women want. They want the responsibility that they may develop themselves. Man will never, truly respect woman until she has reached his level in all his rights. In the States where the women do vote they have more of the respect of men than they ever dreamed of before. Just so long as the Constitution declares that only the male cltzens shall have the 'privilege of voting we women will be put in the cate gory of idiots and criminals, who are also proscribed In the Constitution. But we are now progressing. There are wheels within wheels at work in our behalf in Washing ton trying to Fecure our rights for us; there are societies in every State and those not in touch with the work have no idea of the herculean work that has been done. I be lieve that the people in the Philippines should be taught the doctrine of equal rights from the beginning, and we are peti tioning Congress to leave out the adjective 'male' In their constitution." At the close of Miss Anthony's address Mrs. Chapman Catt, the national organizer of the association, was introduced, and she said she wanted to make the statement that Indiana was the only 8tate In the Union that did not have a suffrage associa tion. Said she: "In 1S51 Indiana organized the first suffrage association In this coun try, but to-day she is the only State In the Union without one; we are going to have a meeting to-morrow morning, and I want the women of this city to come out. and re deem their State." The meeting will be continued thl9 after noon at 2:50 o'clock, when the following programme will be given. Miss Anthony presiding: "Does the State Need Woman Suffrage?" Lew Wallace, Jr.; song, Mrs. Fremont Swain: "The Need of th? Hour." Mrs. Chapman Catt; discussion. Miss Mary G. Hay; music, Mrs. Philip Goetz; "Woman and World Progress," Rev. J. A. Mllburn. THE 

OPENING SESSION. Governor Monnt Delivers the Address of Welcome 3lr. Flslihnck'a Titlk. The woman's suffrage conference opened yesterday afternoon at Plymouth Church, and there was such a good attendance that Miss Anthony feels sure there are many be lievers In woman's rights, not only among the women of Indianapolis, but among the men as well. The auditorium of Plymouth Church was well niled with a fashionable audience, apparently Interested In hearing Miss Anthony and willing to give support to the Issue of a woman's suffrage. Mrs. May Wright Sewall presided and. after a few brief remarks, she Introduced Governor Mount, who made an address of welcome. He said: "On behalf of the people of Indiana, I take pleasure in extending to the representatives of the National Wom an's Suffrage Conference a cordial wel come. Your organization records the names of some of the noblest women of ovr land. The honored name of Susan B. Ant hony Is widely and favorably known and will ever bo associated with that which stands for progress and the elevation of women. This association has advocated many measures of genuine reform. Mr. Roberts, the Mor mon congressman, attributes his formid able opposition to his being seated In Con gress to the efforts of the church wotu?n of America. The discussions and delibera tions of your council will lead to a better understanding of the rights, the privileges, powers and responsibilities of your sex, not only as they relate to public affairs, but to the home as well. It is In the home that character is formed and the destiny of gov ernment determined. In this realm the mother reigns supreme and in this domain she shapes the future weal or woe of the Nation with more positive certainty than do the rulers in authority. Your council will render valuable service to the country In the elevation of the home through broader Intelligence among the women. Wherever the exalting Influence of women has been enlarged, good results have fol lowed. From the logic of the past we may discern the foreshadowing ofthe time when to women will be , given a voice in tne laws to which she is amenable and which impose upon her taxation. Justice pleads in favor of giving her some voice In determining economic questions, since hun dreds of thousands of her sex arc bread winners. Intuitively woman is man's su perior. In love, and fidelity, and constancy, she Is superior. Woman, with her gentle, refining, ennobling and elevating influence must ever remln a power for good In the uplifting of society and the exaltation of the Nation. With an abiding faith In the safety of your council and the sincerity of your purpose, again I welcome you to the hospitality of our people, trusting your deliberations may be profitable and your sojourn pleasant." 

MISS ANTHONY'S REMARKS. After Governor Mount's address of wel come, Mis3 Anthony responded. In the course of her remarks she said: "It was In the autumn of 18C9 that I first remem ber your city the same year that our na tional organization held its nrst rawuub the capital of the Nation, and it was there 11. 1- e Tr,inn. fieoree unci aa Hou.ru v. . W. Julian, who was tne nrst roan iu sent to the House of Representatives a pe tition for the franchlsemcnt of women. An other pleasant remembrance of Indiana was my acquaintance with Robert J. Owen. During the war. what was called a Wom an's Rights Society held meetings, which developed into the Loyal Woman s Na tional League, after the war, and Its or ganization owed more to Owen, who be lieved In woman's rights, than any other man or woman." . . Miss Anthony spoke of the Indiana state society, which, she said, was the only so cietv that held annual state conventions during the entire war, and all the time that Dr. Mary Thomas, one of Its presi dents, lived. It never failed to meet annu ally. Miss Anthony said she would never forget the day when the word male was Inserted in the fourteenth amnd,me"t- That little word "male" wrought all the mischief, restricting the rignts to male citi zens, she said. When the fifteenth amend ment, was added woman was i again Bpurned. "For fiftv-one years." said Miss Anthony, a little handful of women have been working for the rights of women-for Justice and political rights, and the time will come, un trhon woman will be man s equal in ' everythlng-political rights In- eluded." After Mi?s MV. "'t.XChatard on the latter's return from Rome. rar3t $S& nGoTlorae."GM;lnw.ai? FUhbSktrhe bishop reached New York on the delivered the address of the afternoon on vv,t tw and Society Have Done for Women in the Past Fifty Years. MR. FISHBACK'S TALK. He said in part: " 'Man as He Was, as He Is and as He Ought to Be, was the subject selected by an ambitious under graduate for a college oration. It was a large topic, we will admit. My theme has a somewhat narrower scope, but narrow as it Is, It will be difficult for me to treat it adequately in the short space allotted to me this afternoon. Men and women re formers all complain that legislation moves with slow feet Experience has shown that innovation is not always Improvement, and you are doubtless fami'iar with Mr. Buck le's aphorism that the best legislation Is that which repeals existing laws. I have been a student and observer of the course of legislation concerning the rights of women tor the last fifty years and that much has been accomplished in the way of amelioration is clear, though it must at the same time be confessed that much that is desirable, remains to be done. The mar riage ceremony in the Australian Jungles bad the merit of simplicity the bushman waylaid his intended, wooed and won her with a club and dragged her to hi3 hut r.o cards, no presents ,no wedding march. The church wedding of to-day presents a pleasing contrast to such a spectacle and the most pessimistic reformer must admit that there has been an improvement. The ancient codes of the civilized nations treat women with scant courtesy. By the laws of Draco, Solon and Lycurgus, women were ignored. They were beneath the no tice of the law they were under a perpet ual tutelage as it was called. There was a slight improvement under the Roman law. By the English common law, which, in the estimation of the early sages, is the perfection of human reason, her rights were enlarged considerably, and yet the married ladies present might be dis posed to find fault with its wide provi sion. For Instance, a married woman could not possess personal property. Everything of this nature to which she is entitled at the time of marriage, and which accrued in her right during mar ilage was vested solely in the husband. This was as far back as the history of Knglish common law can be traced. In the contemplation of the law the wife was scarcely considered to have separate, ex istence. She and her husband constituted cne person. The husband was the head cf the wife, and therefore all that she had belonged to him. He took It free from any light of ownership in tee wife; he might sell it, give It away and dispose of It by will, and at his dying intestate it went to his administrator and not to his wife. 

COMMON LAW PARTIAL. "The common law was also partial. If a husband killed his wife It was plain murder with benefit of clergy, but If a wife killed her husband It was petit treason and the convicted wife was to bo drawn and burnt alive. This was the law until the time of George the Third. The common law of England was one of the priceless boons cur ancestors Inherited from the mother country and brought with them across the Atlantic and fought for In the revolution. It became, and is to-day the common law of Indiana, except so far as legislation has changed it. As late as 1S43 it was declared by the statutes of Indian that all persons except married women. Infants, idiots and persons of unsound mind. might dispose of their property by will, and I have hard some oversensitive persons ob ject to the classification. Ten years after ward a law was enacted which conferred the right of making wills upon all persons except Infants and persons of unsound mind idiots and married women were not mentioned. After this law was passed a married woman made a will, and in an ar tlon contesting its validity it was argued that the phrase, 'all persons, did r.ot In clude married women, for did not the law say that upon marriage the wife ceased to be a person? After a lape of seven years the Legislature passed a law declaring that a married woman was really a person, and that she was included in the phrase, 'all per sons.' To-da', by the laws of In diana, the married woman in respect of her property may do with It what she likes, except that she cannot convey or encumber her teal estate unless the husband joins In the conveyance, and she cannot enter into a contract of suretyship. "I am sorry to say that there were mem bers of .our profession who opposed the admission of women to the bar, but the Supreme Court came gallantly to the res cue and declared that if a. woman was qual ified by attainment and Xcharacter she should have the right, to practice law if she desired to do f-n. As dean of a. law school I was a close observer of the progress and signal success of four, young women who won honor and the degTee of bachelor of l laws In the Indiana Law School. In the ' five civilized nations, Germany, France. England. Austria and the United States, there are 2O.O'W,0u' working women, and of these 3.00Q.OUQ are in the United States. To you men and women and to the efforts of your association, society Is large ly indebted for whatever of amelioration has been wrought In the condition of women In recent years. ' And while you have not accomplished and may not ac complish In the near future all that you desire In the direction of a political en franchisement, you have a right, In view of what you have already achieved, to hope for a complete realization of your alms. On the abstract question of the rliht to ote, it seems to me that there can be but no opinion. There remains the question of policy or expediency. Will It work good or evil to society? and here, experience must settle the question." TUBLIC DUTY OF WOMEN. "The Public Duty of Women Every where," was discussed by Mrs, May Wright Fewall. She said that when she was In England, at her first meal In that country, she noticed that sugar seemed to be sweeter and the salt saltier, and after questioning the other member of the party they all agreed that sugar must be sweeier and salt saltier in Great Britain than la America. Upon Investigation it was dis covered that In England women vote and the Pure Food Commissioner are not elected through any political "pull." but by their merits and honesty. Mrs. Sewall spoke thus to how how much better re lults are obtained where women vote. 6he al'o spoke of the life of the private citizen which is not private. In a sense there is cotMng private a woman's gowns are dis cussed, ber receptions and teas are talked about in the public press, as are her clubs and other affairs. She asked the audience to look at the different hills passed by the Legislature, and they all are of as much Interest to women as to men. The purity of milk, the purity of butter, the freshness ot vegetables, the gas questions, the gen uineness of cream and all such questions should be decided by women k well as men. The afternoon session closed after a song by Mrs. Rhea Hill Dehytner. Will Visit Girls' Reformatory.

O'DONAGIIUE IS RACK FROM MEETING WITH IHSIIOI CI I ATA RD. The Latter Had Jast Arrived In Nev York from C a rope What the Bishop Said Aboat Ills Visit., The Rev. D. O'Donaghue, vicar general ana administrator of the Catholic dlocesa of Indianapolis, has returned from New York, where he went to meet Bishop Cunard liner Urabria, Saturday evening, and Father O'Donaghue was with him all day Sunday. The vicar generat then started for home, leaving the bishop to make his way back leisurely. It was the bishop's in tention to visit friends at Baltimore and Philadelphia. He Is expected home to-morrow. The bishop's old-world trip was under taken with two objects In view. He ex pected the trip to benefit his falling health, and the time had arrived for him to make his regular decennial report to the Pope of the condition of affairs in his diocese. Father O'Donaghue says the trip greatljr improved the blsnop's health, and that he did not meet with a single mishap during his trip. The bishop, he pays, first visited Cardinal Vaughn, in England, and then went to Paris, where he spent some time with old acquaintances. From there he went to Lourdes, which is close to - the Spanish frontier, and spent a week before going to Rome. Father O'Donaghue was asked concern ing the truth of a ca-.e dispatch In a New York paper to the effect that the Pope, in receiving Bishop Chatard, spoke in terms of wgxm approval of a plan for the Inter vention of Preslaent McKlnley to prevent further bloodshed in the Boer war. and that the Pope expressed to Bishop Chatard a "fervent hope" that the President would Intervene. s. talked to the bishop about that." said Father O'Donaghue, "and from his reply I Judge the story was manufactured In the New Y'ork newspaper office. The bishop told me he had two audiences with the Pope. Both were concerning the condition of affairs in the Indianapolis diocese, and nothing, he told me, was said about the Boer war or about any other matters for eign to diocesan affialrs. The New York pa per caoled the b.shop at Rome asking him to send a cablegram giving the details of the alleged Interview on te Boer war, but he did not reply." "Were any Important plans affecting the future of the diocese outlined?" "1 should Judge not. 1 think the bishop reported a satisfactory condition of affairs generally and that was all there was of the conference." "Does the bishop corroborate the pub llsheu stories that the Pope is in very poor health?" "No. he does not. He was surprised at the Pope's great mental activity and recraing good health. He says the Pope has no In tention of dying." THE
