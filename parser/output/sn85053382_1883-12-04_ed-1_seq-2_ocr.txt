THE DAILY ENTERPRISE. Published every day except Sund FRIGHT & HENDRY, : Publishers LIVINGSTON, M. T., DEC. 4, 1883 President Arthur is one of the 130,000 members of the »'Ancient Order of Unitec Workmen." He belongs to a New York City lodge, and is in full and regular standing. After all the fever of doubt in which which newspaper correspondents and edi tors have endeavored to keep the public over the result of the speakership election Carlisle seems to have won so easily that his success must have been a foregone conclusion. Carlisle is a pronouncec revenue reformer, and before being made speaker said that in case of his success he should so use his position that in future the democratic party should go before the people upon an aggressive and definite platform, and that in forming committees he should aim to appoint men of peculiar fitness to deal with the various subjects of legislation that are to engross the attention of congress. The account of mineral discoveries on Stillwater creek contained in our corm pondence from Big Timber will be read with interest. We remember not many months ago to have been told by one who had been over the ground that the liveli est town in the Yellowstone valley was yet to l>e started and that such a town was to be supported by mineral deposits in the Stillwater district. While we expressed a pardonable doubt about the prospective town, we were impressed by the report of the mines in the locality named because we had confidence in the relator. But they are a part of the Crow reservation, and until that portion of it is thrown open to public settlement will remain unpro ductive. But all these discoveries, unim proved though they may be for the pres ent, go to prove that mining in eastern Montana has only begun, and upon the smallest scale compared with the record to be made in years to come.
