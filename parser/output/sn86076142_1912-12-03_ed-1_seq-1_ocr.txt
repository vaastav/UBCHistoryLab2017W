ARMSTICE WILL BE SIGNED PRESIDENT URGES THE RAISING Of .11 acts alleged but denied they were improper j The trial of Judge Robert V. Arch- bald for conduct amounting to a j violation of his oath as federal judge j had been Bet to open today before j the Benaie court of Impeachment a a result of Judge. Archbald request last August that his attorney be given more time to prepare their case. The charges against Judge Arch bald arose in connection with private, and otfitial acts both a a judge of the court of commerce and a United State district Judge for middle Penn lylvania. He was Impeached by the house of representatives after a full investigation of the fact by the de partment of justice, and extended hearings before the house Judiciary committee. The ' manager appointed by the house to prosecute the case before the aenate asked for an Immediate trial last August, but the senate de clined to hasten its consideration of the ca8e. During the last week scores of subpoenaeB were lsHtied for witnesses who will be brought be fore the Benate by the house man ager and by Judge Archbald attor ney in connection with the trial. After the house committee on Judi ciary had concluded It hearing last Hiring It recommended that Judge Archbald be called before the senate under Impeachment proceedings. The last time the house had exercised It impeachment power wa in 1904 when Judge Swaue, I'nited StateB Judge for the northern district of Florida, was called to account for misconduct and was acquitted by the senate. The houso of representative on July 11, 1912. adopted article of Impeachment by a vote of 222 to 1 and a committee headed by Repr entatlve Clayton of Alabama, was chosen to act as the manager on the part of the house to try the case before the senate. The house man ager urged the senate to grant an Immediate trial but that body de clined to hear the case before the end of the lust session. Thirteen separate article consti tute the basis for the impeachment trial. These embrace dealing be tween Judge Archbald and railroad officials and others in regard to Pennsylvania coal or 'culm" dumps and coal land; contributions by at torney and other to the judge's va cation trip to Europe In 1910; reput ed "secret" correspondence by the Judge with a railroad attorney con cerning a pending case; and alleged attempts to have notes payable to Judge Archbald discounted by at torney and litigants before hi court. In presenting the case to the house Representative Clayton suid that the Judiciary committee was of opinion that Judge Archhalil's "sense of mor al responsibility had become deaden ed" and that he had "prostituted his high office for personal profit " The principal charge grew out of the Kadwtid Culm bank deal. hi this charge It as asserted that w-hib ths Krie llailr.md company had pend in before the commerce court two n. Judge Anhhald, corruptly and stated the case against the judge, covering the evidence brought out at the hearing before the house judiciary committee and reviewing the formal charges published several months ago. . aal v GAL BKOUtiHER

In consequence of these things, says the president, there has been a general easing of international ten sion on the west coast of South America. He also adds that the di plomacy of the United States is ac tive in seeking to assuage the re maining ill feeling between this coun try and Colombia. Taking up some of the details of the year's diplomatic work, the presi dent refers with expressions of pride w ill make to congress iu the early I to China, where "the policy of en- day of the session, and deals en- j couraging financial investment to en tirely with the foreign relations oi , able that country to help Itself has ihe United States. Beginning willi j had the result of giving new life the usual reference to the existing i and practical application to the open good relation with foreign powers, j door policy." The consistent purpose the president addB that these have ! has been to encourage the use of been strengthened by "a greater in- j American capital In China, says the Bistence upon justice to American president, to promote the reform to citizens, or interests, wherever It which the country is Dledeed bv may have been denied, and a strong-I treaty with the United States and other powers. There has been a vigorous assertion, also, he says, ot the equal right of the United States to a voice in all questions pertain ing to Chinese loans and developments. President Taft makes the direct charge that the terrible events re corded in Nicaragua recently, the useless loss of life, the devastation of property, the bombardment of the principal cities, the killings and the tortures and Bufferings, "might have been averted had the department of state, through approval of the loan convention by the senate, been per mitted to carry out it now well de veloped policy." "In Central America Ihe aim has been to help such countries a Nica ragua and Honduras to help them selvps," says President Taft. The financial rehabilitation of these countries by American bankers and the protection of their customs houses from being the prey of would be dictators, says the president, would remove the menace of foreign creditors and revolutionary disorder. Furthermore, the United States would profit largely in a business way through the development of the great natural resources of Central Ameri ca. Commending the successful results of the application ot (he new neutral ity laws to Mexico and other trou bled countries the president suggests that means be found In addition to prevent Ihe professional revolutionist from making American ports "fuel for revolutionary intrigue. He reit erates his determination to adhere in the case of Mexico to the "patient policy of nonintervention, steadfast recognition of constituted authority, and the exertion of every effort to protect American Interests." Other paragraphs of the message point to the Increase of American domestic export by $'joii.oon.noo dur ing the past year, making the great "st total ever known. :',-'iMl.(to: to the agricultural credit system which not thoroughly endornod. lo ihe prob able necessity of an amendment of the fur seal act to permit limiting killing of seals; to a meeting of the arbitrator in Washington next year to adjust the pecuniary claims be-taiH-u Great Britain and America: in negotiations with Mexico for Ihe di irlbiition of Ihe watera of Ihe Cobt railo river In the Imtwrlul valley Hon; and lo the financial rehabillla lion of Liberia Tbere i merely historical reference l.t Ihe I tuneae revolution; l lh San U.mili'gau Iroiibb-. the retllion ill Cuba and Ih Balkan war devel opment, in which it i aatd) lh I n tied S'atea I nl Involved The tiifaaA roni'bid with an tiMiet ar-peal t rnrea la cimh era'e Ii l th hi une In It elfori 'it '.U - old prliiriplo of di i.l.im,i. t; h hate aoveMiwI lh liiartera lo ailrmm hi it none tnii says the president, the state depart ment has obtained substantially I tit most favored nation treatment from all of the countries of the world. Therefore, he say, that It Is only natural that competitive countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning, "If in some instances, the measures taken by thein to meet it are not entirely equitable, a rem edy should be found." To this end, the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the gov ernment, instead of imposing the full maximum rates of duty against dis criminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to that maximum of 25 per cent. "Flat tariffs are out of date," says the president. "Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations, Irrespective of the treatment from the received It is very necessary that the Ameri can government should be equipped with weapons ot negotiation and 1 adapted to modern economic condi tions. The state department, "an archaic and Inadequate machine," at the be ginning of this administration, tht president pays, has become a new organization, with highly specialized bureaus and experts dealing with every phase of American trade and diplomacy. Holding that the essence of this reorganized service is found in the merit system, which President Cleveland Is credited with having Introduced. President Taft makes a strong appeal to congress to nuike this machine permanent, by giving the force of statutory law to the ex ccutlve orders governing admission to and promotion In the diplomat ic and consular services. To show that these appointment are already largely nonpartisan, the president point to the fact that three cf the present ambassadors are holdover; that of Ihe ten he ha appointed, five were by promotion from the rank ot minister; (lint of the .in uiinlHiera appointed. 11 were promotions; and that in the ronsol.ir service no leva than ".i per rent of (he consul appointed by him were frem Ihe soul hern ta(ea.
