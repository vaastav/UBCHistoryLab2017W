THE DEMOCRATIC ADVOCATE. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1866. ■ i'i '■ f ■■ INDICTMENT OF REGIS TRARS. The Grand Jury, at its late session, presented two of the Registrars of this county for alleged improper discharge of their duties under the Registry Law. They are Capt. George W. Shriver, of Westminster, and Richard Harris, Esq v ofllatnpstcud. It could not have been on account of any moral delinquency, for the characters of both these gentlemen arc as unimpeachable as that of any of the Grand Jurors; nor ou accouut of any disloyalty on their part, for Mr. Harris has been a consistent Uniou man, and Capt. Shriver served his coun try faithfully in the Federal army du ring the war. Their chief offence has been that they understood and applied the Registry Law differently from what the Grand Jurors and the Radical par ty would have done. In short, it is our solemn belief that the guilt of these Registrars consists in their misfortune to have come to the honest conviction itbat the view which Governor Swann, Ex-Governor Bradford, all the best law yers of the State, and the Conservative party generally entertained, was right; and that the Radical views were wrong. Now we are not going to reflect on the moral honesty of the Grand Jurors who, we have no doubt, acted to the best of their knowledge, judgment and advice—filled as they are with the be lief that the views of their party arc ac tually infallible, and that all that comes from their opponents is to be regarded with the utmost suspicion. In no other way can wc accouut, with credit to the Grand Jury, for their having presented two such estimable gentlemen on a charge which should be founded on of ficial corruption. It shows the desper ate lengths to which party prejudice has gone, and the great necessity to have the system of summoning Juries so re formed as to secure men of both parties on them, to act as a check on party feel ings, and purge the sources of public Justice from all taint of political preju dice. If these cases ever come to be tried, we arc satisfied that the views we have taken will be fully sustained, and that many who may now think that this pro . ceeding is right, will be sorry and ashamed that it was ever commenced. They will yet * live to sec that the hard and illiberal construction put upon the law by their press and party with such presumptuous confidence cannot bear the test of a strict legal inquiry. Wc are confident that a close investigation will show that these Registrars were compelled in the strict discharge of their duties, if they wished to do jus tice to their fellow citizens and escape the penalties of the law, to understand it very differently from those whose du ties did not require them to study it so closely, and whose party feelings would scarcely allow them to construe it gen erously. The law gave every claimant of the right to vote the opportunity to purge himself on oath of all suspicion of disloyal intention, and the Registrar was bound at his peril not to disfran chise him unless strong proof was ad duced sufficient to clear away all doubt i of his guilt, and of his having taken a false oath. It was astonishing what slight circumstances were sufficient, in the mind of a Radical, to convict any constant political opponent of both trea son and perjury; and when faithful Registrars refused to adopt their policy the threat of indictment before a Grand Jury was freely tendered. Neither the constitution nor the law intended that a man’s secret feelings should be drawn out to criminate him self and to disqualify him, and yet the Radicals always insisted on so construing them. The Constitution and the law only disfranchised such as by open word or deed aided the Rebels, with criminal intent ; and yet we have seen their Reg istrars, and Judges of election, disfran chise men on the silliest pretences— such as a thoughtless hurrah for Jeff Davis, only intended to gall a political opponent, or some such trivial matter. It was really astonishing to see the ex tent they would go to exclude a man who had been a constant Democrat and liable to suspicion on that account.— This was witnessed on the part of their election Judges everywhere. In three of the districts of Carroll county, Taney town, Myers, and Manchester, it was carried this year to a painful extent, par ticularly in Manchester District, where . 'hundred* wore turned off by the Regis trar, and a district which can give three hundred and fifty Conservative majority, on a fair and free vote, was made to giro a Radical majority of seventy-five. Never was there a greater political out rage, nor a law more glaringly violated, yet where is the indictment against : these unfaithful Registrars! Echo an "• swers “where?'’ So far from their be* ing indicted we doubt not the Grand Jurors are under the impression still* that they have only done their duty— aud hence by contrast, we can see why the ‘chursc of Capt. Geo. W. Shriver and Richard Harris should seem so odi* ous in their sight. To those faithful officers we say—Do not fear ths Your cause , is the cause of the People. The beat legal counsel of the State will feel it an | honor to defend you; and a sympathi sing public will cheerfully foot all the expense. > IMPARTIAL SUFFRAGE. 5 The advccatcs of impartial suffrage J mean by it the extension of the right to • colored men of the legal age ; whilst 1 they hesitate about extending it to wo ) men, some of whom arc now seriously 1 demanding it. Many of them are dis r posed to qualify the right to such col* 1 ored persons read, possess some f property qualication, or have served in f the army. To make it impartial they • propose to restrict also the whites to the 1 same qualifications. We arc opposed to - all qualifications of the right of suffrage - to parties entitled, except the necessary 3 restrictions usually required. If negroes 1 arc to be allowed to vote here, we should t give it to them to the full extent, same - as to the whites, and make them eligi r ble to office. Those who have the right j to participate in the government should ; by all means be equal ; and with that i view it will be found necessary to break , down all social distinctions and to mon - grelise our people, as well as our gov ; ernment, as soon as possible, so as to get ; rid of those inconvenient ideas which . difference of race and color seems to pi t i in some people’s heads. i Wc arc, however, totally’ opposed fo i such unnatural We would 1 uot agree to extend the sacred right of ■ suffrage to the smartest, most intelli ■ gent, aud richest negro in the land, for i the simple reason that, if we conceded to him the right, we give up the whole question, and should yield it to- every negro in the land on the score of im partiality. We do uot believe the Al mighty designed that all races and col ors should mix in the same nation, or He would not have made them of such different colors, aud would not have implanted in tho human breast feelings and prejudices which prompt each su perior race to be so jealous of its purity. We believe that the highest instincts of the human race are the voice of God; and if they have prompted men to over throw slavery by all means, right or wrong, they will also do as much to prevent that which is still more repug nant; the amalgamation of extremely different races. When wc survey the world, wc find its several nations diversified by various races and colors, but each by an iuilcx iblc law of nature generally composed of a homogeneous people. All history proves the constant war of races, even of those not very dissimilar. The ruin of Mexico, in modern days, has been caused by attempted equalization of all ( races there, where the result has been | that reins of government have passed I from the hands of the pure Castilian ; blood into those of inferior races—five sixths of the population being the des cendants of the original inhabitants, mixed up with other races white & black. ■ We arc not opposed to the Negroes j enjoying the highest rights of citizen-1 ship ; but we say it cannot be enjoyed ! here, because it would bring ruin both j to (hem and us. By rigid cnforccmenTl of the instincts of nature, and common sense, wc may save our country and race from debasement; and niay do the same for the Negro, lie may think it hard at first; but, as soon as his mind opens to the conviction of the truth, he will sec a glorious field opened to him in Africa, whcnccylie came; and he will eagerly rush there to fulfil his destiny. There he can rise to all the rights and privileges of equal citizenship. This we acknowledge to be his due—not here, for we hold it as the highest in sult to ask our people to destroy their natural dignity to put him on an equali ty here. There he may hold himself as 1 superior to the whites if he pleases ; but here he must concede to us the same right. For these reasons, imperfectly expressed, wo give our voice against any admixture of races, or colors, in admin istering our government. Wc go for suffrage as little restricted as possible; but we believe that to sustain our Rc • publican theory we need to be as a pco • pie the highest and purest on earth.— ■ Others countries may be governed by 1 Black \ cllow or Red people; but ours must be “the White Man’s Govern* • meat.” ” —• <■ I CONGRESS. This body re assembled on Mond y 3d iost. A new feature was introduced on this occasion. The Radical Clubs, Leagues. Colored Zouaves, all sorts and colors, paraded the streets, under a call to Washington to greet Congress, which ‘ is swelling in importance as the coun try’s dignity decreases. Justice Carter delivered the address of welcome, and was responded to by Speaker Colfax, Senator I ates and Judge Kelly. The speeches were inflammatory. At night there was a great banquet, at which Mr. Walbridge presided, and Thaddeus Ste vens responded in an abusive and trea sonable harangue. This is a great . country, particularly the North. B&.The Baltimore Gazette has come out in a new dress, its advertising pa tronage having required an enlargement of its ample pages, or the reduction of the size of its type—the latter being the plan adopted. Its appearance is im proved. We are glad to see this-evi dcnce of success. Improvement in County Jails and Alms Houses. There has been a State Missionary appointed to visit the Jails, Alms Hous es and Public. Institutions throughout the State to co.operate with the Com missioners, Keepers and Physicians of these establishments in ameliorating the condition of the inmates, ’ibis they propose to do by establishing* Commit tee of ladies and gentlemen in each county town who will furnish them pure reading, endeavor to have regular reli- ■ gious services conducted for them, and visit them occasionally to speak a kind word and direct them to a higher aim in life. Also to furnish them with Bi bles, Testaments &c. Rev. J. 11. Beckwith, the State Mis sionary, waited our town last week and succeeded in getting some of our wor thy citizens to co-operate in this good work. The following will kindly assist those who have, the oversight of these establishments —Rev. J. T. Ward, Rev. John A. Munroc, Dr. Warfield, Dr, Charles Billingslea, Messrs. Norris, Grammer, Baughman, Sheriff Hoppe, Mr. Jacob Myers, Mrs. Dr. Warfield and others. The State Missionary expressed his hearty approval of our Jail, which is quite an improvement to the old one. There being separate apartments for male and female, and cells for each prisoner, so the young offender who has just begun crime shall not be contam inated by associating with the hardened criminal, but may receive such instruc tion and counsel that his first shall also be his last offence. This arrangement is a credit to our Commissioners and County Officers, and will tend to make our county respected for the humanity and consideration shown to the unfor tunate. We trust others will aid in this good work by joining this Commit tee, and Westminster may stand first in ameliorating the sufferings of the poor and the erria^. o BSP* "The Camp, the Battle-field and the Hasp,taC or Lights and Shadows of the Great Rebellion , is the title of a handsome volume, just issued by the National Publishing Company, 507 Mi nor btreet, i hiUdelphia, Pa. The Au thor, Dr. L. P. Brockctt, has delved most industriously amongst the masses of curious incidents which have mar-, ked the late war, and has grouped amj| classified them under appropriate heads aud in a very attractive’form. There is a certain portion of the war I that will never go into the regular his tories, nor be embodied in romance or ; poetry, which is a very real part of it, and will, if preserved, convey to suc ceeding generations a better idea of the | spirit of the conflict than many dry re | ports or careful narratives of events* i a°d this part may be called the gossip, the fun, the pathos of the war. This illustrates the character of the leaders, the humor of the soldiers, the devotion ot women, the bravery of men, pluck of our heroes, the romance ami i hardships of the service. From the | beginning of the war the author has j been engaged in collecting all the aucc j dotes connected with or illustrative of it. The volume is profusely illustrated with over 100 engravings by the first artists, which are really beautiful; wor thy of examination as specimens of the art. The book’s contents include re miniscences of camp, picket, spy, scout, bivouac, siege and battle-field adven tures ; thrilling feats of bravery, wit, drollery, comical and ludicrous adven tures, etc., etc. Amusement as well as instruction may be found in every page, as graphic detail, brilliant wit, aud authentic his tory, arc skillfully interwoven in this work of literary art. It is just such a volume as will find numerous purchasers, and just such a one as persons seeking to act as book agents should add to their list. The President’!* Message. The Message of President Johnson uas delivered at the opeuiugof Congress on Monday lust, aud was received by us too late for publication this week. It is not of great length, but able aud poi fectly consistent with his past course. He repeats with great force his views i i favor of re construction, aud says that time and reflection have only strength ened his convictions ou the subject. He hopes that each department of the Gov ernment may cooperate in maintaining harmony between them, and in support of the Constitution, the Union and the perpetuity of free institutions. The finances are considered so favorable that ho thinks the taxes may be rcduc ed, and the debt paid in the next twenty-five years. Our relations with France he thinks will be favorably maintained. Also with England, al though the Irish question looks trouble some lie makes no allusion to col ored suffrage. Another Astronomical Event. An interesting astronomical event will occur on the 6th instant. The Sun, Mercury, Venus and Earth will bein’ conjunction, a’fact that will not occur again in several centuries.

Fair. —The new Lutheran Church Vow being built in Westminster, as it rises towards completion, is attracting considerable notice by its fine appear ance; whilst at the same time the heavy draw on the funds acts as a reminder that more will. be still wanted. For this purpose it is designed to have a Fair, at the Odd Fellow’s Hall, some time in February—say the 22nd. All persons interested in the cause are respectfully invited to attend a meeting at the Parsonage, on Saturday evening next, to make preliminary arrange ments.

Although the watchers in our country were disappointed in seeing the meteoric display expected to come off on the morning of the 14th of November, it seems they were not disappointed in Europe. For about an hour and a half, after midnight on the morning of the 14th ult., they wore observed through out England and Scotland, were they are described as numbering several thousands. A French paper says they appeared there by millions.
