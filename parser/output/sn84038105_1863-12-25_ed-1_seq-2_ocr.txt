SAMUEL MeDOWELL, . - Con. JOHN C. CLARK, Je., - Wiiiulngton, Vhr int iana. Uni. llfd Lie», Utl DELAWARE'S POSITION. Passing event« have already convinced Ike most casual observer, that Dolaware is destined to become a free »Stato. st it tit ion of slavery lias not for years liad a secure lodgment with our people. Tht contiguity tf our northern extremity with one free State, and the separation of entire eastern liuo by only the nar row waters of the Delaware river and bay from another, have had a tendency to der slavery leas secure than in those states more in The in AYitli never days. ment, the near ly this the left that the our reu remotc from free territory. Tho probabilities of escape being greater here than in a State further south, the number of fugitives has been proportionality great As our business and social communi cations with the free states have increased, our opinions of slavery and its consequen ces have been modified, and our former prejudices materially changed; while the slave's opportunities of gaining his freedom ky flight, have become This drainage upon "tho institution" hi not only nffeeted it numerically, but greatly detracted from former valuations of the negro slave in the statç of Delaware.— At tho breaking out of this war, therefore, slavery here was undergoing a sloyv but certain process of extinction; ibis rebellion will but excelerate its lingering dpath.-r Ab it is, we shall see the shaekels stricken from the last slave ; while otherwise, this "relic of barbarism" might have maintain ed a nominal existence in our midst for years to come. We may therefore regard slavery as an abolished institution iu this State. er. that oath the son ject* are lion tives the iqto gold, more numerous. The formality of legislative enact ment mu y speedily arrive, b\4 pun pot givp, practically, any greater certainty to its ex tinction than now exists, in this County who would regard its abolishment with regret is true, for de mocracy will shudder with horror at be holding its favorite idol shattered into i/au incuts ; but the great mass of OUT Ä <> pic inspirited as they have been by the cause of human freedom—and wrought up as they arc by this uncalled for rebel lion, to an immovable determination to the in a c in That there are some bring tho issues involved in this war to practical conclusions—will rejoice with unfeigned gratification over the destruc tion of slavery as the generator of treason and the only impediment to American greatness. The abolitiou of slavery iu this State is becoming populur, because it is right in principle, because it is allowable under our constitution aud laws, because it will add greatly to the prosperity and greatness of our little Commonwealth, and because it is in unison and conformity with the great idea of American liberty.— Slavery must die ; its advocates must be silenced ; this appanage of American trea son must be forever extinguished. The whirligig of fate is rattling a discordant requiem over tho dying agonies of the m«dia*vul curse of America, and when its last vestige shall have been obliterated in the United States, every citizen of this then noble republic will feel prouder of his country and her institutions. Ther* is another fact which is giving popularity to the cause we espouse. It is success, ihe popular heart loves to hour the song ol triumph aud the shout of victory, aud will uncontrolably participate in and ap prove of these jubilant demonstrations.-— Victory has already perched upon the ban ner of our cause, and the issue is no longer wavering and doubtful. AA T e are the tri umphant party in the polities of the day. The democratic party did at the last elec tion refuse to vote. It thus not only acknowledged its defeat, but diabauded it« followers aud proclaimed its owu disor ganization. To be called a black rspubli can was once considered insulting now many voluntarily assume that name; but a tew months ago the aboliliouist was con fined to the snow banks of the N land States; he now exista in Sussex county. Recently in this section of State the self considered elite of our fash ionable society, (God save the mark Î) gave tone and consequence to their respectabil ity by the most blatant enunciations of Eug « vr i.ur pro-slavery sentimeuta. To-day he who has the audacity to advocate slavery is vairrously regarded as a vative, or a southern sympathizer, as effect ed with tho mania africanic , or as com pletely satura teil in the treasonable oiivities of the later-day democracy. t waddling conaer pro SURGEON MAULL. We were much gratified, last weeki a viait from our friend Rurgeon Maull, of the 1st Rcg't. Delaware Volnntocrs. His return to hie home, being unexpected, was agreeable surprise to his numerous ' I friends in this vicinity. The hardships ' of active campaigning have not in the : slightest impaired his health ; he is look ing letter and stonter than when he first left for the war. At tho breaking out of the rebellion, the Doctor enlisted m the three month s serviec, and received the an appointment of the f irst Lieutenancy in Co. G, upon its organization. He after wards was promoted to the Captaincy. At the expiration of the three month's ser vice, the First Regiment was reorganized ; the Doctor returned home, assisted in raising Co. E, and when that Co. was xnua tei-ed in was appointed Surgeon, which he lias since occupied. lie was with his regiment at the battles of Antietam, Fred rieksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Bristow's Station, aud every other fight in which the regiment lias been engagid. Verity, the Doctor has smelt gunpowder. AYitli tho exception of this visit, he has never liad a leave of absence, but for ten days. As the oldest Surgeon, by appoint ment, he now ranks as Surgeou-in-chief of the 2nd Brigade. Surgeou Maull has shared in all the hardships uud trials of this noble old regiment, and truly deserves the position which he now occupias. He left home, ou Monday last, to rejoin the army. We wish him all success, and hope that before he again returns, he will enter the city of Richmond with the victorious Army of the Potomac. BAYARD AND SAHLSBIJiRY. It will he seen, by reference to the pro ceedings of the U. 8. Souate of last Friday, that Bayard aud Saulsbury object to the oath of allegiance to the government of the United States. All Iruh/ loyal men would , and could take this oath. The rea son >yhy these Senators, whq sq miserably misrepresent this Stato iu tho Senate, .ob ject* tp this oath of allegiance is, that they are disloyal , and sympathize with the rebel lion ; and with the rebels. Veil their mo tives as they may, their actions speak trumpet-tungued, that they are disloyal to the government which has cherished them iqto life : and from whjch thqy, each, re ceive three thousand dollars , annually, in gold, for those very peculiar services which qll loyal men appreciate ; and which history, truthful history will appreciate.— Their its de be into <> the to 'tions also loudly proclaim, that they belong to ; and are in league with a faction, the copperhead, sham-Dcmocracy, \yhich, in accordance to their oft repeated decla rations, have refused "to vote a dollar, a man to suppress the rebellion:" and WÎ\!» l>x those actions. are_"aa/ c fort'* to the rebels now in an is against their government. It is high t me, that these men, and all like them, were placed in their proper position, and out of harm' or ' way. to THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Our readers have had an opportuuity of studying the President's last annual message. It is a document worthy of the attention of the people, and of the excel lent and exalted chief of a great nation. Without any attempt to eke out a sen tence; or "round a period;" it takes Lola, at once, of the great questions which now engage the attention of the world ; and presents, those questions in a calm, statesmanlike, and most able manner. The progress,achievpients, and position of our patriotic, gallant armies and navy, as presented by the President, are grati fying to every loyal heart:—and whilst they call forth earnest thanksgiving and praise to Him "who orders all things after the counsel of His own will —gives as sured hope, nay confidence in the final triumphant success of the Union and of the restoration of Peace, ie-union and hnppiness. Our finances are shown to have bceu most faithfully managed, under the able control of Mr. Chase, the very ablest Secretary of the Treasury since Alcxqmler Hamilton. cause, tri The AA'ar debt, it is manifest, is less than we might have expected—in view of the gigantic operations, and extraordi nary efforts of the Government to save the lift of the nation. No nation has ever achieved as much, within as brief a period of time, and at as little cost, as the Federal Government bas achieved within less than three years. It is truly wonderful, as exhibiting the a bundant, the unbounded resources of our loyal people, that this gigantic war has been conducted, without borrowing one dollar of any foreign capitalists. The Commerce, foreign and domestic, of the United States, is in a most prosperous condition. The manufacturers and me chanics of the loyal States, have never been more so. The same may be said of our agricultural interests. Education, morals, and religion have been cultivated and advanced. The hu manity, and benevolence of our people, and of our government, through the tary and Christian commissions, challenge and claim the admiration and respect of the whole civilised world. Thank God that it is our happy lot to live under such a government ; and among such a people as ours.

DANISH QUESTION. We present to our readers, a statement of "the Danish question," by the London Punch, whose statement is "clear as mud." It is no wonder that a question so mysti fied, so entangled, so difficult, should be seized, with avidity by the diplomats of Europe to exhibit their skill in preserving the "balance of power," which usually ends a general war :—but to Mr. Punch — "Tiie Danish Difficulty Explained.— Young persons who dine out, and wish to be considered well-inform young diuers-out, must desire to be able to answer, in a few simple words, the question so frequently put as to the real value of tho difficulty about the King of Denmark's succession to tho Schles wig-Holstein duchies. Mr. Punch will ex* plain tho matter in a moment. The case is thisc King Christian, being an agnate, is the cpllatcral heir male of the German Diet, and consequently the Duchy of Holstein, bo in«; mediatised, could only have ascended to the Landgravine of Hesso in default of con sanguinity in the younger branch of the Son derbur^-Gluffkshuvgs, and therefore Schlcs wig, by the surrender of the Duke of Saxo 'obnrg Gotha, was acquired as a nei w ouîTnaër by vfie morg&Vtttjo n Frederick VII. This is clear enough, oi course. The difficulty, however, arises from the fact that, while the Danish protocol of 1852, which was drawn up by Lord Palmer ston, but signed by Lord Malmesbury, re pudiated ex post facto the claims of princess Mur y of Anhalt, as romainder-woman to the Electores8 of Augustonburg, it only oporuted as a uti bossideties iu reference to tho in terests of Prince Christian of Schloswig-IIol* 8tcin-Sonderburg-Ulucksburg, while Baron Bunsen's protest against Catholicism, under the terms of the Edict of Nantes, of course barred the whole of the lineal ancestry of the Grund Duke from claiming by virtue of the Salic clause of tho Pragmatic Sanction.— The question is therefore exhaustively reduc ed to a very narrow compass, aud the dispute simply is, whether an agnate who is not consanguineous can, us a Lutheran, hold a fief which is clothed by médiatisation with the character of a neutral belligerent.— This !b really all that is at issue, and those who seek to complicate the case by intro ducing the extraneous statement, true, no doubt, in itself, that tho Princess of Wales, who is the daughter of the present King of Denmark, made no public renunciation of either of the duchies, or tho ivory liuir brush es, when she dined with Lord Mayor Rose, are simply endeaoring to throw dust in the eyes of Europe." ; at u of iN gtffaivg.

LATESTJNEWS. THIRTY-EIGHTH congress. First Hesslon. The probabilities now are that Congress will pass no important bill beforo adjourning over for the holidays. The bill amendatory of the Internal Revenue'*act as respects whis ky, tobacco, &c., was not sent to the Commit tee of Ways and Means to-day by tho Secre tary of the Treasury as was anticipated, us the Committee has adjourned over till Monday. The bill relating to pay aud bounties, and that ameudatory of the enrollment act, were reported to the Senate from the Military Com mittee to-day, but tlicir consideration was postponed until they could be painted, one objection being sufficient under the rules to effect this. The only amendments not pure ly verbal, made by the Committee to the first named bill, are we *of Its providing that colored soldiers who are in all other respects put on the same footing with white soldiers shall not receive any bounty ; and one extending the soction increasing the pay to drafted men as well as voluutcors. The only amendments not mentioned to the bill amending the en rollment act ore one limiting several clauses in tho exemption section so us to require the claimant to show that ho actually supports his mother, and one striking out the proviso forbidding the draft of a felon, and one em powering the Boards of Enrollment to enroll any person who reaches the age of 20, and to discharge any one who reaches the age of 45 between the time of enrollment and that of Re to thirty dear a As imme~ very the draft. Bureau of Emancipation.—The bill intro duced by Representative Eliot of Mass., and referred to the Select Committoe of which he is chairman, creates a Bureau of Emancipa tion in tiw War Department with a Commis iioncr on a salary of $4,000, at the head. To his Bureau all questions touching freedmen are to bo referred, and all returns of proceed ings to be made by military and civil officers charged with the execution of laws or orders relating to freedmen. The Commissioner is also charged with the execution of laws pro viding for colonization, the delivery of bond? for compensation for freedmen, and the es tablishment of regulations for their treatment and disposition. Pay and Bounty.—-In the amendments to the Pay and Bounty bill, reported by Senator Wilson from the Committee on Military Af fair;, bounties aro confined to those enlisting prior to January 5, 1864, and after that date no bounty to substitutes, and none to enlisted or drafted men, excepting the bounty of $100 now allowed, will bo paid, Tlio Enrollment act.—rThe same Sonator reported back the bill amendatory of the En rollment Act, adding a new clause abolishing the $300 commutation feature of tho present law. It includes the enrollment of "any per son arriving at the nge of 20 years and any who has not been in tho service two years and honorably discharged."

It is designed to locate its commence ment at Eugene City, to run by way of the middle fork of the Williamette River, and through the jposfc feasible pass of the Cascade Mountains near Diamond Peak to the south eastern boundary ot tho State. To aid iu its construction, Mr. Nesmith of Oregon, introduced into the Senate a bill providing for giving three sections of public lands for each mile of the road. He also introduced ern another bill with a similar provision in aid of the military wagon road from the Dalles of the Columbia River to a point on Snake River, near the mouth of the Dwyhee. In the United States Souutc on Friday, Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts, called up his olution for a new rule, requiring that Sena tors before entering on their duties tuke the oath of allegiance prescribed by the act of Congress.

There are no other gunboats here. Tho movements of the Chesapeake, since her first appearance at Shelburne, have been narrowly watched by the Uuited States offi cials and the American citizens on tfio Pro vince. Her whereabouts wore daily known, but the absence of tho gunboats had caused delay in her capture. On Tuesday the El lu and Annie, Lieut-Commanding J. F. Nick els, arrived for ooals, and was immediately supplied at Cunard's wharf. Sho received information oftho pirate, and at Ilf P steamed for her, arriving at her rendezvous at 3 P.

Meantime, the officials securing informa tion of tho pirates being at Sumbro, notified Lieut. Nickels, wko immediately steamed for her, determined to take her, and at daylight on Thursday acojmplished it. The crew of fered no resistance, but at the sight of their pursuers immediately fled to the woods, leav ing a sumptuously prepared breakfast. The Chesapeake was immediately takeu in tow, and Lieutenant Nickels started for an Am oriean port, The Dacota soon came up and ordered Lieutenant Nickels and the prize into Hali fax lor Banption of the act by tho Govern ment, where tho three vessels arrived at 4 P.

Upon the arrival of the boat containing the prisoners at the Queen's wharf, file excite ment became intense. The prisoners were seized by a boat's crow in the slip, and hur ried off by the crowd in attendance. Upon the government officers attempting to arrest the prisoners under a warrant, they were seized and held by prominent citizens, and rendered powerless to perform their duty, The mob finally succeeded in getting the pirates off in a small boat, which forthwith oved down the bay.
