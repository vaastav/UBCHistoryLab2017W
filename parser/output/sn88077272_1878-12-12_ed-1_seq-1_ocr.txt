RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. International Postal Congress. JWoa-Oltitau Ihe Benat ami Btutt of Jteprwn- NUWff. Oar heartfelt gratitude 1 dne to the Di Tine Being, who holds in Hie hands the destinies of nations, for the continued be stowal, dnring the last year, of countless blessings npon our country. We are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit t as greatly improved, and is, perhaps, now stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our manu facturing industries are reviving, and it is believed that Keneral prosperity, which has been so long anxiously looked for, is at last within our reach. ' THE PESTILENCE. The enjoyment of health of our people 'generally has, however, been interrupted, during the ,paat season, by the prevalence of .a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions of the Southern States, creating an emergency which called for prompt and extraordinary measures of re lief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the Lower Mississippi, soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spresd by fugitives from the infected-cities and towns, and did not dis appear until early in November. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Ten- hundred thousand cases .are believed to have occurred, in which about twenty thou sand, aocording to intelligent estimates, proved fatal, ft is impossible to estimate. with any approach to accuracy, the loss to ihe country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned oy the hundred millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted, excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntary contributions of money and supplies, in every needed form, were speedily and generously furnished. The Government was able to respond in some measure to to the call for help, by providing l.nh DiaininAB anil tnnA fni tka aint anA destitute, the requisite directions for the purpose being given, in the confident ex pectation that this action of the Executive would receive th.i sanction of Congress. Ahont eighteen hundred tents, and rations of the value of about twenty-five thousand dollars, were sent to cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper De partment. The fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened -a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administra tion, which Bball not only control quaran tine, bnt have the sanitary supervision of iuttrnal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the Slate and municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers the publio health, and which the municipal S'ate authorities are unable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to provide the means for carrying it into practical .opera tion, during the past season, is a step in the direction here indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protec tion of our seaports, and the country gen erally, from this and other epidemics, it is recommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and careful considera tion. - ... PACIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens in every civil and political right continues to be of paramount interest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uni form progress to the desired consummation awakens general uneasiness and wide-spread condemnation. The recent Congressional elections haveTurnished a direct and trust worthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical estabishment of tbe right of suffrage, secured by the Constitution to the liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, real or imaginary, had been removed from all these fitatea. The three constitutional amendments, ' which conferred freedom and equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens who maintained the authority of the National Government, and the integrity and perpetuity of the Union at such a cost ' of treasure and life as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the just results cl tne war. ine people 01 we lormer slave-holding States accepted these results, and gave, in every practicable form, assur ances that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, should, in (rood faith, be enforced, rigidly and impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest should, under them, receive full and equal protection in person and property and lu political rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments, the Southern section of the Union obtain a large increase of political power in Congress and in tbe Electorial College, and the country justly expected that elections would proceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the same circumstances of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which is obtained in all the other States of the Union. The friends of law and order looked forward to the conduct of theae elections, as offering to ine general juugmeni 01 me country an mportant opportunity to measure the de gree in which the right of suffrage could be exercised bv the colored peonle.'and wonld be repeated by their fellow-citizens, but more general enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and a more Just and generous protection of that freedom by the communities of which they form part, were generally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. In some Ol U1UB6 OUBWB 111 W 11IUU bUC VU1UICU fJCUjJlB have been unable to make their opinions r .1 o 1. : t. i 1. . felt in the elections, tne result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or rem edied by legal protection ; but in the States of .Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular Congressional dis tricts outside of these States, the records of the electionsseem to compel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden, and their participation the elections not permitted to be either eeneral or free. - It will be for the Congress for which these elections were held, to make such examina tions into their conduct as may be appro priate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the Ex ecutive and Judicial Departments of the Government, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of the laws the United States which have occurred. can but repeat what I said in this connec tion in my last message, that whatever au thority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the eoOMs, the executive authorities, and the people of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their nsaiitt ance toward bringing to justice the offend ers, and preventing: a repetition of Ik Climes.

WHOLE NUMBER 606. be spared to obtain a full and fair investiga tion of the alleged crimes, and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the gnilty. It is to be observed that the principal appropriation made for the Department of J ustice at the last session contained the fol lowing clause : " And in defraying the ex penses which may be incurred for the en forcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled An act to amend an act approved Hay 30,4870, entitled an act to en force the rights of the United States to vote in the several States of tbe Union, and for other nurooses.' or any act amendatory -thereof or supplementary thereto." it is the opinion ot tne Attorney gen eral that the expense of the proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations to enable the Executive Department to en force the laws. I respectfully urge upon your attention thst the Congressional elections, in every district, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political interest and con cern ihroughout the whole country. Each State, every political party, is entitled to the share of power which is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every citizen, possessing the qualifications prescribed by law, to east one nnintimidated ballot, and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as well as formally, submission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the depaitments of Gov ernment will feel the true vigor of the pop ular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative interests of Government, however urgent or weighty will ever dis place the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship. They un derstand that the protection of liberty re quires tne maintenance, the full vigor, of the manly methods of free speech, free press, and suffrage, and will sustain the full authority of Government to enforce the' laws which are framed to preserve these es timable righ s. . The material progress and welfare of the States depend on the pro tection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without such protection, no prosperity without peace, and ihe whole country is deeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts. While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and reciprocal confidence between, the communities b lately and so seriously entangled, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with increasing force. The power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, in demanding that all ever our wide territory the name and char acter of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. a a of I to Our relations with other countries con tinue peaceful. Cur neutrality in contests between foreign powers has been main tained and respected. The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been attended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and ar rangement of the contributions of our citizens to this great Exposition was well employed ip energetic and judicious efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These ef forts led and directed by the Commissioner General, were remarkably successful and the exhibition of the products of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope and char?oter. The reports of the United States Commissioners, giving its re sults in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international com petition for the favor and the trade of the world may be expeced to produce useful and important results, in promoting inter course, friendship and commerce with other nations. - In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878, three commis sioners were appointed to an international conference on the Bubject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for tbe purpose of establishing internation ally, the nse of the bimetallic money, and securing nxity 01 relative yaiue Deiween those metals. - Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had expressed a willing ness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held its meetings in Paris in August last. The report of the Commis sioners herewith submitted will show its results. No common ratio between gold and silver coin could be agreed upon by the Conference. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in tbe world the monetary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each State. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 to pay tho award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, f. after correspondence with the British Government, on the subject of the conform- tv of the award to the requirements ot tbe treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submitted to the Commission, the President shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communications upon these points were addressed 1 1 the British Gov ernment through the legation of the United States at London. Failing to obtain the concurrence of the British Government in the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a no tice of the grounds of the payment, and protest against any other construction of the same. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you. The spanisn uavernment nas omciaiiy announced the termination of theinsurrec- tion in l uba. and the restoration of peace throughout that island. Confidentexpecta tions are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity, which it is earnestly hiped may prove wen iounaea. xumerous ciuiius 01 American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of properity, have been among tbe incidents 01 ine long-connnuea Hos tilities. Some of these claims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and careful considera tion. - The treaty made with Italy, in regard to reciprocical consular privileges, has been duly ratified and proclaimed. riO questions ox grave uupuriuuuc uavv arisen with any otner 01 tne European powers. The Japanese Government lias Deen de sirous ef a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as rehve commerce, and, it is understood, nas ad dressed to each ot the treaty powers a re quest to open negotiations with that view. Tbe United States Government has been In clined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions noon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people, can not due enect injuriously nations Hav ing commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of seclusion, has within tne past iew years maae rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall assimilated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to tms has been made, which will be submitted the consideration of the senate. After an interval of several yeais, Chinese Government hits again sent envoys to the United States. They have been ceived, and a Peru ancnt legation is now tablished here bv that Government. It not doubted that this step will be of ad van tage to both natioi.sin promoting friendly relations and reinoviii! causes of difference. The treaty with theSamoan Islands, having been duly ratified and accpled on the part of both governments, is now in operation, and a survey and boundiugs of the harbor of Paeo-Pmio bavebeenmade by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view its occupation as a naval station, if found desirable to the service. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with ilnico, correspondence heen onened attd still continues between the two Governments upou the various que tions which at one time seemed to danger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has done mucn to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now under stood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also making an energetic movement again Bt the marauding Indian tribes. xniB uovernmentiooas witn the greatest satisfaction upon every evi dence of strength in tbe national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon oun territory, reluctant to assume any actior or attitude in the control of these incur sions, by military a movements across the ooraer, not lmpertiveiy uemaauea xur iub protection of the lives and property of our own citizens, it shall take the earliest op portunity, consistent with the proper dis- cnarge 01 imapiain uutj, w recognize me ability of the Mexican Government to re strain effectively violations of our territory. It is proposed to hold next year an Inter national Exhibition in Mexico, and it is be lieved thatthe display of the agricultural and manufacturing products 01 tne two na tions will tend to better understanding and increased commercial intercourse between their people. With Brazil and the Republics of Centtal and South America some steps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial intercourse. Diplomatic rela tions have been resumed with Columbia and with Bolivia. A boundray question be tween the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been submitted by these Governments for 'arbitration to the President of the United States, and I have, after careful ex amination, given a decision upon it. A naval expedition op the Amazon and Madeira Rivers has brought back informa tion valuable both for scientific and com mercial purposes. A like expedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation td the de velopment of onr foreign commerce, have furnished many facts that have proved of publio interest, and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of onr people. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY'S REPORT to be The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury furnishes a detailed statement of the operations of that department of the Government, and of the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $257,763,878.70 ; the ordinary eqptnditures for the same period, were $236,964,320. 70 leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $20,799,551.90. Tbe receipts for the present fiscal year, ending Jane 30, 1879, actual and estimated, are as lollows : Actual receipts tor tne first quarter commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389, 743.43; estimated receipts for the remain ing three-quarters of the year, $191,110, 256.S7. Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as lollows: for the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, act ual expenditures, $73,344 573.27: and fori tbe remaining three-quarters ot tun year the expenditures are estimated at $166,755, 326.83. making the total expenditures $240,100,000; and leaving an estimated snrplus revenue, for the year ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. Ihe total receipts during tne next nscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated ac cording to existing laws will be $264,500,000 ; and tne estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be $236,320,412.68 ; leaving a surplus of $28, 179,587.32 for that year. In the foregoing statements ot expendi tures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act approved February 25, 1862, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal vear, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliance with tbe conditions of the law. By its terms, the public debt should have been re duced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year, $518 361,806.28; the actual re duction of the ascertained debt in that period has been $720,644,739.61 ; being in excess of the reduction required by the sinking fund act 202,282,933.33. Tbe amount of the pnblio debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1, 1878, $2,024, 200,083.18 a reduction since the same date last year, of $23,150,617.39. The progress made during -tne last year, in refunding the public debt at lower rates of interest, is very gratifying. The amount of four per cent, bonds sold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is $100,270,900, and six per cent, bonds commonly known as five-twenties, to an equal amount, have been, or will be re deemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the Department to place the four per cent, bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his sayings, whether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, and that through the post-offices, or other agents of the Government, the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such investments. The best mode suggested is, that the De partment be authorized to issue certificates of deposit, of the denomination of ten dol lars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent, per annum and convertible at any time within one year after issue into four per cent, bonds authorized by the refunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United States noteB sent to the Treasury Dy mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law. supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily without cost or rise, to convert his money in n an interest bearing security of the Uniti-I States, and the money so received con lie applied to the redemption of six p 1 cf-t.t. bands. The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $52,798,980. The coinage of silver dollars, under tbe act passed February 28, 1878, amounted on the 23d of November, ltso, to $ia,on,oou, 01 wmcn amount 984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in the possession ot tbe Government. With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of silver pro ceeds, it has been the purpose ot tne secre tary faithfully to execute the law, and to afford a fair trial to the measure. In the present financial condition of the country, I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will be best promoted by ab staining from all attempts to make radical , . h -. , 1 1 i : cnange in ine existing nnanciai legismtiuu. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be un disturbed by governmetal interference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that the resumption of specie pay ments, which will take place at the - ap pointed time, will be successively and easily maintained, and that it will be fol lowed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity. Let the healing influence 01 time, tne in herent energies of our people,' and the boundless resources of our country, have fair opportunity, and relief from present difficulties will surely follow. 

SECRETARY OF WAR. is of has en The report of the Secretary of War shows that the army has been well and economi cally supplied, that our small force has been actively employed, and has faithfully per formed ail service required ot it. the morale of the army has improved, and the number ot desertions nas materially de creased during tbe year. Tbe Secretary recommends : 1. That a pension be granted to the widow c-f the late Lieuterant Henry H. Benner, 18th Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer M, Chambers, sent with supplies for the re lief of sufferers in the South from that dis ease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs of de ceased officers, as suggested by the Pay master General. 3. The adoption by Congress.of a plan for the publication of the reoorda of the War the Rebellion, now being prepared for that purpose. 4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier-teachers employed in post-schools, ana xioerai appropriation iwr tne rrcuuuu of buildings lor schools and libraries at dif ferent posts. 5. the -repeal or amendment of the act of June 18. 1878. forbiddins- the " use of the army as apo.- comitatut, or otherwise, for the purpose 01 excuung tne laws, except m such cases and under such circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the Consti tution or by act of Congress." 6. The passage of'a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the isBues of rations, tents and medicines which were made for the relief of sufferers from yellow fever. 7. That provision be made for the erec tion of a fire-proof building for the preser vation of certain valuable -records, now constantly exposed to destruction by fire. These recommendations are all com mended to your favorable consideration. THE NAVY. The Report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the navy has improved dnring tbe last nscal year. worK baa Deen done on teventv-five vessels, ten tf which have been thoroughly repaired, and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward completion. Tbe total expenditures of tbe year, including the amount appro priated for the deficiencies f the previous year, were $17,468,392.65. The actual ex penses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18 less than those of the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the ex penses, including the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381 45 exceeding the ap propriations of the present year only $33, 949.75 ; which excess is occasioned by the demands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the Secre tary's report. The appropriations tor the present fiscal year are $14,528,431.70, which, in the cpinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the current expenses of the Department during the year. The amount drawn trom the Treasury from J uly 1 to IN o vemberl, 1878, is $4 740,544.14. of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as tbe expenditure for that period $4,669,563.30, onn n t T xi - 1 1 . 1 : ur ov,ct?u.zt less man uie correspouuiux period of the last fiscal year. 

POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT. The report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of the opera tions at the Posteflice Department. The expenditures of that Department for the fiscal year ended June30, 1878, were $34, 165.084.49. The net receipts, includinz sales of stamps, money-order business, and omciai stamps, were $29,277,515.90. The sum of $290,436 90, included in the forego ing statement of expenditures is chargeable to preceding years, so that tbe actual ex penditure for 'the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are $33.874,637 50. The amonnt drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to tbe revenues of the Depart ment, was $5,308,652.82. The expenditures lor the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1880, are estimated at $36.571 ,900. And the receipts from all sources at $30,664,023 90. leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. The report calls attention to tbe lact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads for carry ing the mails is regulated by law, and that the failure of Congress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the Government of responsibil ity, but necessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass. in providing lor the postal service the f-jllowine questions are presented : Should Cong, ess annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be estab lished as will make the Department self sustaining? Sliou'd the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way? Should the number of postal routes be diminished? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish ex penses of the postal service? 

INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE. The International Postal Congress, which met at Paris, May 1, 1878, and continued in session until June 4 of the same year, was compose ol delegates from nearly ail the civilized countries, of the world. It adopted anew convention, to take the place of tbe treaty cuuuiuueu at ierne, uctoDer y, 104; which goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between the countries whose delegates have Bigned it It was ratified and ap proved, by and with the consent of the President, August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Convention will be found in the report of tbe Postmaster-General, and the full text in the appendix there to. In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three counties, having a population of three hundred and fifty millions of peo ple. On the 1st of April next it will com prise forty-three.countrieand colonies,with a population of more than six hundred and fifty millions of people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies which maintain organized pos tal service, constituted, in lact as well as in name, as its new title indicates, a Universal Union, regulating, upon a-uniform basis of cheap postal-rates, the postal intercourse between all civilized nations. Some embarrassment has arisen ont of the conflict between the customs laws of this country and tbe provisions of the Postal Convention, in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by moil. It is honed that Con er ess will be able to devise some means of recon ciling the difficulties which have thus been created, so as to do justice to all parties in volved. The business of the Buoreme Conrt and of tbe courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such an extent, durine the past years that additional legislation is impera tive to relieve and prevent the delay cf justice and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of the Attorney General, anu tne remedy suggested is earnestly urged for Congressional action. The crea tion of additional circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense the present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 year. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. a J. of The annual reports of the Secretary the Interior and of the Commissioner Indian Affairs, present an elaborate account of tbe preeent condition ot tbe Indian tribes, and of that branch of the public ser vice wbicb ministers to tbeir interest While the conduct of the Indians, eener al ly, bas been orderly, and tbeir relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in tbeir cnaracter, but re mained, bappily, connned to a compara tively small number of Indians. The dis content among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts of violence on the part 1 .1 Al , . I Hume uxeiuuera ui iub tnue anu nnaiiy the outbreak, appears to have been caused by the insufficiency of food on the reserva tion, and this insufficiency to have been owing to tbe inadequacy of the appropria tions, made by Congress, to the wants ot the Indians, at a time when 'the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency hunting. After an arduous pursuit by troops of the United States, and several en gagements, the hostile Indians were re duced to subjection, and tbe larger part tbem surrendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection, I desire io call attention to the recommendation made by the Sec retory of the Interior, that a sufficient fund be piuced at the disposal of the Executive, to be used with proper accountability, discretion, in sudden emergencies of In'dian service. , The other case of disturbance' was that a band of Northern Cheyennes who sud denly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through States of Kansas and Nebraska in direction of their old hunting-grounds, committing murders and other crimes their way. From doenments accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly. baud was fully supplied with the necessaries of ns the four thonaiind seven hundred other In iians who remained quietly on the reser vation, and that the disturbance was oaueed by men of a restless and miiebltvous dl position among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole -of this band have sur rendered to the miliary authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that, when some of tbem had taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarm- ng rumors to tbe contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been complied with. Both the secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite in the recom mendation that provision be made by Con gress for the organization of a corps of mounted Indian auxiliaries," to be under the control of the army, and to be used for the purpose of keeping the. Indians on their reservations, and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part I earnestly con cur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under the Government, it be ing a matter of experience that Indians in onr service, almost without exception, are faithful in the performance of the duties assigned to them.. Such an organization would materially aid the army in the ac complishment of a task which in numeri cal strength is sometimes found deficient But while the employment of force for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies for the ulti mate solution of what is called the Indian problem. It may be very difficult and re quire much patient effort to curb the un ruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re straiots of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and self-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or in themonntains of the far West, and were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white pop ulation ol the United States; but we sbonid not forget that)theyfare'the aborigines of the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grown rich, power ful, and happy, we owe it to tbem as a moral duty to help them in attaining at feast that degree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It is not only our dnty it is also our interest to do so. In dians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in property. will thenoelortb cease to be a wailike and disturbing element It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of Indians themselves and from many concurring reports, that there is a steady increasing desire, even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have tbeir unuoren educated. I invite attention to the reports of the Sec retary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty In dian children, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton N ormal Agricultural Institute, in Virginiu, where they are to re ceive an elementary English education and training in agricultural and other useful work, to be returned to their tribes, alter the completed course, as interpteters, in structors and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with- the selection of those children might have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been posslble'fo make provision for them. .1 agree with the Secretary of the Interior in saying that " the result of this interesting experiment, if favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advance ment of civilization among tbe Indians." The Question, whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made, was at the last session of Congress, referred to a Committee for inquiry and re port. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so important a question, tbe views expressed above may not oe tost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it in oe, will arrest inrtner agitation 01 tnia subject, such agitation being apt to pro duce a disturbing effect npon the service as well as on the Indians themselves. HOT 

SPRINGS COMMISSION. In the enrolment ap propriations for sundry civil expenses, at tne lasi session 01 uougress, uiat purtiuu which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As the C ommission bad completed tne wore of taking testimony on the many conflicting claims, the suspension ot tbeir laoors, before determining tbe rights of claimants, threatened, for a time, to embarrass the interests) not only of the Government, but also of a large number ot tne citizens 01 Hot Sptings, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were ap prehended, and at the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs and others interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to request the late uommissioners vo tase 'hurse ot tbe records ot tneir proceeaines, and to perform such work as could properly be done by them under such circumstances, to facilitate the fnture adjudication of the claims at an early day, and to preserve the BtAtiiR nf the ftlnimsinta until their riehts should be finally determined. The late Commissioners complied with that request and report that the testimony, in all the cases, nas been written out, examined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement wben autnorizea Dy law. It is recommended that the requisite au thority be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair com pensation be allowed the late Commissioners lor the expense incurred and labor per formed bv them since tbe zotn 01 June last. TIMBER LANDS, AND AGRICULTURE. a of of of to by of at the of the on as life I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by the Secretary of the. Interior with recard to the preservation of the timber on the public lauds of the United States. The protection ot tbe pub lic property is one of the first duties ot tb Government The Department of the In terior should, therefore, be enabled, by suf ficient appropriations, to enforce the laws in that respect But this matter appears still more important as a question of publio economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest conseanences. especially in the mountain ous districts, where the rocky slopes once denuded of their trees, will remain so tor- ever. There the injury once done can not be repaired. I fully concur with the Secre tary of the Interior in the opinion for this reason legislation touching the public tim ber in the mountainous StateB and Territor ies of the West, should be especially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruction of the forests is not sum cientlv guarded against, should be. speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be matter of urgent public necessity. From the organization of the Governmen the importance of encouraging, by all pos sible means, the increase of our agricultural productions haa been ackowledged and nreed nnon the attention of Congress an the people as the surest and readiest means of. increasing our substantial and enduring prosperity. The words of Washington are as appl: cable to-day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said : " It is not to be doubted that with reference either to individual national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance, in proportion as nations au vance in population and other circumstan ces of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting grow up, supported by the public purse and 10 wnat ooject can it u; ucuivatcu im greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this eml, none have bppn flttpnilt-rl with frrpnter success than the establishment of boards composed proper characters, charged with collecting gnd diffusing Information, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to en courage and assist the spirit of discovery and improvement this species of establish ment contributing doubly to the increase of improvement bv stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a com mon center the results everywhere of indi vidual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Ex perience accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefit" The great preponderance of the agricul tural over any other interest in the United States entitles it to all the consideration claimed for it by Washington. About one half of the population of the United States is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the United States for the year 1878 is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. The exports of agricultural products for the year 1877 as appears from the report of the Bureau of Statistics, was five hundred and twenty four millions of do'lars. Tbe great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own borderr, and by our own labor, not only the necessaries but most of the luxuries that ore consumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad vantages of soil, climate and intercommuni cation, it appears from the statistical state ments in the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from fnroifrn lanrla manv vnilli.ma , HullaM1 worth of agricultural productsfwhich could oe raised in our own country. Numerons questions arise in the practice of advanced agricnlture which can only be answered by experiments, often costly, and sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for tne benent 01 the nation, it is good policy, especially in times of depression and un certainty in other business pursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage, by every proper and legitimate means, tbe occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of the Department of Agricnlture to stimulate old and introduce new agricul tural industries, to improve the qnality and increase the quantity of our products, to determine the value of old or establish the importance of new methods of culture, ore worthy of your careful and favorable con sideration, and assistance by such appro priations of money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this im portant interest. The abnse of animals, in transit, is widely attracting publio attention. A National Convention of societies specially interested in the subject has recently met at Balti more, and the facts developed, both in re gard to cruelty to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress, and enactments of more efficient laws for the prevention of those abuses. 

EDUCATION. The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifying progress throughout tbe country, in all tne interests committed to the care of this im portant office. The report is especially en couraging witn respect to the extens-on 01 the advantages of the common school system, in sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet attained. Ta education more than an v other agency we are to look, as the resource for the ad vancement ol tbe people, in tne requisite knowledge and appreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I desire to repeat thesugeestion contained in my for mer message in behalf of the enactment o appropriate measures by congress lor tne purpose of supplementing, with National aid, the local systems of education in the several States. Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing the capacity ot tbe rooms now occnpieo at tne capitoi, shonld be provided without delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts and illustrative art has grown to such pro portions, in connection witn t lie-copy ngm system of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is national in its cnaracter, ano must, irom tbe nature of the case, increase even more rapidly in the future than in the post, it can not be doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. The appeal of the Regents of the Smith sonian Institution for the means to organize, exhibit and make available for the pnblic benefit the articles now stored away belong ing to the National Museum, I heartily recommend to vour favorable consideration. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MATTERS. The attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of the river-front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to the health of the residents of the National Capital, both temporary and permanent that the low lands in front of tbe city, now subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a danger ous source of malarial poison. The re clamation will improve the navigation of the river, by restricting and consequently deepening its channel; and is also of im portance, when considered in connection with the extension of the public grounds and the enlargement of the park, west and sonth of the Washington Monument The report of the board of survey, heretofore ordered by act ot uongress, on tne improve ment of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respectfully commended to consideration. The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents a detailed statement of the officers of the District, The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for local parposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people of the District greatly ex ceed those ot tne uenerai uovernment. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the de fective pavements ano sewers 01 ine city, which is a work of immediate necessity. and, in the same connection, a plan is pre sented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of the District The benevolent, reiormatory, and penai institutions of the District are all entitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform School needs additional building and teachers. Appropriations which will place all these institutions in a condition to become models of usefuluess and benefi cence, will be regarded by .the country as liberality wisely bestowed. The Commissioners, with evident i ustice, requestattention to the discrimination mode hv Cnnsress against this District in the donation of land for the support of the pub lie schools, and ask that the same liberty that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various States and Territories of the United States, may be extended to the Dis trict of Columbia. The Commissioners also invite attention to the damage inflicted upon public and private interests by the present location of the depots, and switching tracks of the several railroads entering the, city, and ask for legislation loosing to tbeir removal- The recommendations and suggestions con, tained in the report will, I trust receive the ctreful consideration of Congress. Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization of the government of the District, under tne recent legislation of Congress, for. the expression ot a con fident opinion as to its successful operations, but the practical results already attained are so satisfactory that the friends of the hew government may well urge upon Con gress the wisdom of i's continuance, with out essential modification, until by actual experience its advantages and defects may oe more iuiiy asceriaineu.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 2, 1878. of Some girls are exceedingly foolish, One in Bridgeport, Conn., married Mexican whom she had known but three days, and two hours after tbe ceremony wae pertormea tommenceu a suit tor a vorce, as she had changed her mind. Means to Prevent Grave-robbing. A man in Iowa proposes to fill the space around a coffin with hydraulic cement, which will soon become so hard that it cannot be broken without nsing a blast of powder. A citizen of Cincin nati has patented a coffin safe designed to protect the remains of the dead from the emissaries of dissectine-rooms. It consists of a case much larger than the coffin and is composed of bars of wrought iron. In filling tbe grave dirt passes be tween these bars in such quantities that the safe cannot be lifted without th aid of a derrick. The concern resembles in construction a crate used for holding china ware. The cover, made of iron bars, is secured to the bottom before any earth is thrown in the grave. In the meantime a New York man has paten ted a coffin torpedo, designed for the ex tinction of grave-robbers. It consists of a canister containing powder, balls, and a firing trigger so arranged that it will cause the powder to explode should any one open the lid of the coffin. A more summary way of diiipostng of grave-robbers is prepared by a Massa chusetts inventor. He would pot a charge of dynamite in the grave, so that a touch of a spade would cause its explosion. . This would be pretty severe not only on the despoilers but the oc cupants of graves. For that matter it would be rather severe on neighboring grave-stones and other monuments to tho memories of the dead as well as fences and shrubbery. While the many recent cases of grave robbery have incited inventions to find out ways of rendering graves secure, they have given a new impetus to cre mation. A cremation society has been organized at Indianapolis and a furnace is in process of erection. Most persons appear to be averse to burning the bodies of their friends and relatives, but between having them cremated or run ning the risk of having them made articles of commerce and then hacked to pieces by unskilled butchers, they would doubtless prefer the former. Jt is possible that the present excitement may result in the adoption of some more satisfactory method ot disposing of the aeaa tnan nas Hitherto been employed. If this should be the case some compen sation will be afforded for the vast amount of unhappmess recent outrages have caused. Where the Law-Makers Live. [Washington Correspondence Philadelphia Times.] - Very few members and Senators own houses here. 1 can only count seven Senators now in Congress who occupy their own houses, namely: Bayard, Blaine, Edmunds, Merrill, Sargent, Inurman. and Wmdom. Ot these, Blaine's is the finest, Windom's next. Edmunds's next, Bayard's next and Thurman's next. Of the members of the House, seven also own their own houses, namely: Bandall (Speaker). very modest house on Capitol Hill. worth about $7,000; Butler, who owns two of the handsomest houses in Wash ington, built of granite, one which he occupies himself and the other which he leases to (senator Jones tor f 12,1)00 per year; (iarheld, who has a very pretty house of brick, worth probably 118,000; Eupene Hale, who occupies an immense four-story brown stone mansion on H street The ownership lies between Hale and his father-in-law, Zack Chandler. When the latter went out of Congress Hale went into the House; now as Hale goes out of the House, no doubt Chandler will come back to the Senate and go into the House again. Gen. Ketcham, another member of the House, owns a very expensive residence here in the best square of the city. Gov. Swann owns a house similar to Senator Blaine's and adjoining it, and Fernando Wood's house adjoins Swann's. I understand that several property holders are lying in wait for our young millionaire Sena tor from Pennsylvania with most desir able bargains. They will tell Senator Don that, as he is likely to stay in the Senate as long as he pleases, it will be desirable for him to own a mansion here befitting his wealth and position, which will be very sensible a i vice. I have often wondered why it was that Penn sylvania has never had a member or Senator in the whole twenty-nine, with rare exception, who kept an open house for Pennsylvanians. Only two of the delegation have made any attempt at entertaining Senator Cameron and Chapman Freeman yet there are many rich men in the delegation. There is scarcely a State whose Representatives live so modestly as those of rennsyi vania. Clymer is rich ; Bridges is rich Harmer is rich; Wright is rich, and there mav be others. What Pennsyl- vanian has ever been entertained by them in Washington T The Pictures the People Love.

"The only thine don't like is the soapsuds." " Of course you must be finding fault." " Come here, 'granny, what does that remind vou of. old eirl?" and the old girl turns with tears in her eyes to the stalwart questioner, as she thinks of a time when she brought tears into his by lather ing him, literally and in the truest spirit of motherly love.
