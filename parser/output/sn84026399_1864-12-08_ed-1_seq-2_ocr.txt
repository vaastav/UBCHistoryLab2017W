Chase, late Secretary of the Treasury, to the chief seat in the Supreme Court of the United States. The new Chief Justice will bring to the Bench eminent legal attainments, and those va ried qualities of head and heart which cannot fail to make the popular Judge, and to show the wisdom of the President's selection. The nomination was sent to the Senate on Monday, and was immedi ately confirmed, without reference to the Judiciary. This was done in courtesy to Mr. Chase, who was. formerly, a mem-: her of the Senate. The citizens of Stroudsburg had the pleasure last Wednesday Eve. of listening to Rev. Wm. B. Marsh, Agent of the U- nited States Sanitary Commission. Af- tr his address clearly stating the designs, the workings, and the needs'or the Com mission, the ladies preseut, organized an Aid Society, cs auxiliary to the Commis sion. The following are its officers, President, Mrs. 

ROBERT PITTS, Treasurer, Mrs. SAMUEL DREHER, Soc'y, Miss CAROLINE MILLER, With five Directors. The object of the Society is to secure and make further garments, stores, aud all kiuds of Hospital supplies. We be speak for the Society the benevolence and co-operation of all. The Society will meet every Saturday afternoon in the Seminary, where it will be glad to meet any of the ladies who de sire to work in the good cause, and to re eeivc coatributious from the benevolent.

Speeches, toasts sing lag, t"S Msilyded tbs entertainment. Queer. Not knowing ibt difference .between mere pot-houee political partisanship andrUrue p& triotism, the Squire' thought ihe5$6 listen ing to a political sermon, at the JRwe byterian onurcn, on manHssiyimr day. -lie never was more mistaken in a supposition in his life. The clergyman who officiated, the Rev. Mr.'Evcritt, is anything but a pohti cian and is. nrohablv. the last maU who , r , v. would undertake to preach a political ser mon. He doubtless has his views, as every right-minded man has, on the relative mer its of parties in this country ; but we have yet to hear of his first attempt to intrude thoBe views upon his friends with whom he comes in daily contact, much lc6s upon a congrega tion, composed, as he well knows, of men with opposing opinions. The Rev. gentle man, on the occasion referred to, felt it to be his duty to impress upon- his hearers the necessity for thankfulness and for earnest prayer, and in the course of his remarks gave abundant reasons why the necessity should be. acceded to. His offense had this extent and no more. The Democratic papers have hardly yet got through publishing Bishop Hopkins's po litical tirade in favor of Slavery, which they periodically applaud to the skies. But not withstanding this, with a queer kind..of con sistency for which they are noted, they do not hesitate to attempt to pull any and every clergyman to pieces, who has independence lough to think and act as though the ac complishment of the work of his Divine Master was of more importance than the opinions of men. Low indeed must the mor als of Democracy be sunk, when its leaders can see nothing in good but a ghoul to harrow up their souls. If in their experience they have no cause for thankfulness, they certainly have much cause for prayer that the good God will open their eyes to the evils sur rounding them, their ears to the calm recep tion of the burning truths of His Gospel, ana their understandings to the right appli cation of those truths. Congiess. The Second Session of the Thirty-Eighth Congress commenced, at Washington, on Monday last. The President's Message, and the Reports of the several Departments were sent in on Tuesday, but were Teceived her too late for insertion in our paper this weok.

There is wanted, iuiinediately.in Mauch Chunk, a Rebel preacher.

As such prayers and applications are higli'ly dis justing to some of our "practical" chris tians, it is desirable that we have at least one who will not give offense to these christians.

A noteworthy Fact. You can always tell from the advertis ing columns of a newspaper who do the largest business and sell the cheapest. The.busiuess men gifted with enterprise and industry, having goods to sell, will strive to outstrip competitors, and inform the public through the press what he has for sale. This is so, and if our readers wish to test the fact for themselves, let them make a note on their next shopping tour of the difference to be noticed be tween the establishments of advertising and non-advertising firms. There will be found evidences of thrift, indications of prosperity in the advertising firm, a "snap1' and a wide awake air about the employers and clerks, in striking contrast with dull, plodding ways of the ''old fogies," who don't "waste" money in advertising. If purchasers wish to jcuow where they will find the choicest goods end the newest styles, they will carefully study the advertisiug columns of their home paper. Mr, F. A. Dony, tho editor of the Hawley Free Press, an intensely disloyal paper was drafted about two weeks ago. The following is a portion of tho oration he delivered upon the occusion' in the next issue of his paper: "Wo are not legally drafted. We known it, and it is not unknown to Mr. rohe. "Such being the case, if Mr. Yohe attempts, without further notice, to set a pack of the refuse of the bar-room and the bachaealia upon our trail, as sure as we have life, we will call upon the people for protection, and with our eyes toward Heaven, and fervent prayer to Almighty God to attest the sincerity of o.ur purpose, we'll fire the first gun of a Northern Rev olution." In defiance of all this cas. Mr. Dony was arrested at his residence in Cherry Rid-ie, on Monday night, by tico of the attaches of the Provost Marshal s office. at this place, and taken to Easton. No resistance was offered. Perhaps his for- ces were demoralized, by the capture of their leader, or his gun was out of order, but more likely he was carryiug out his well-kuown peace principles.

Sam ule Kline is sentenced to two years im prisonment in Fort Mifflin. William Appleman is fined $500 and is to be im prisoned in Fort Mifflin until the fine is paid, provided such imprisonment shall not continue longer than a year.

A fight occurred at a place called Tim ber Ridge, in, Fulton County Southern Pennsylvania, on Friday, between a lot of deserters and Company F of the 201st Pennsylvania Regiment. The contest lasted for about an hour, the soldiers driv ing the deserters for a considerable dis tance through the woods, killing one and wounding two of them. The remainder escaped.
