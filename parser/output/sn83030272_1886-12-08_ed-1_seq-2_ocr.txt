CLEVELAND rightly alma t strengthen our hold upon this useful halfway station on tho route to China and Japan Instead of eacrl flotng our hardwon advantage as wo might by allowing the reciprocity treaty to lapse Tbo Finhcry Dispute I tho fishermen of Gloucester and Port land have been entertaining a hope that the Piesldcnlri message would contain a pleasant surprise for them they must be grievously disappointed This document not only ac knowledges that no agreement baa been reached on the fishery dispute but gives no ground for supposing that any progress whatever has been made toward an agree ment Au Indefinite hope to be euro l expressed that some arrangement of the controversy may b reached before tbo scbslon cuds but hopes wore also held out that a complete settlement would bo reached before tho session should begin Tho terniH too In which tho President de scribes the conduct of the Dominion authori ties are oven milder thou thoeo employed long ago by Mr 

BAYARD who then pro nounced this conduct clearly unjust But it seems that oven tho Presidents declara tion that tho action of Canadas officials threatens our friendly relations with the Dominion Is resented at Ottawa as something not expected Tim assumption of Canada that It could re ly on Mr CLBVKLAND for a different altitude on tho llshory dispute scorns to b derived first from thu way in which tho subject was treated In his annual message of 1885 and secondly Irora the fact that he has taken no stops whatever to use tho power conferred on him by Congress to withhold privileges I from Canadian vessels In our ports in order 1 to cheek tho Canadian cruisers A to tho i frt point Mr 

CLEVELAND admits that tho Sonata met by an adverse vote his lost I years recommendations but ho has the tact not to imply D M BAYARD once did that it was a mistake not to follow those recommendations I Tho truth Is that tho cause ot the fisher I men Is In a very unsatisfactory condition Thoy do not got from tho Treasury a bounty like that which Franco pays but whenever a reciprocity treaty Is not in operation they are protected by the duty on foreign fish from the competition of the Canadian fishermen It is clear that the fshermen eor tnt original idea of the Administration t appoint a joint commission to settle tho fishery dispute might have lod to a renewal of reciproc ity plans But the fishermen thought that reciprocity should b ended once for all Tho documents offered before the Halifax Commission showed that mackerel averaged fiftyfive cents per barrel lower In price dur ing tho two reciprocity treaties than during tho interval between them The fishermen accordingly naked tho Government t stand by thor In refusing to consider any project looking towards the admission ot Canadian fish free of duty Canada however met this proposal by putting a sot of cruisers on her coast guard which not only performed their proper duty of preventing Americana from encroaching n tho inshore fisheries but annoyed them In every Tvr j and denied them tho ordinary commercial I rights wii i even Mr BAYAKD declares to belong to them ToT ° this patiently through the season trusting t diplomacy to help them and now It appears that diplomacy ha thus far dono for them little or nothing at all A Question of Authorship In tho mere matter of rhetorical Interest the Presidents message is decidedly Inferior to that of 1885 Its stylo I colorless the ex pected phrases worthy of record alongside of innocuous desuetude am undlscoverable and there is no passage of glowing and pas sionate Intensity like the prose poem on Mormon wifehood nnd womanhood which Miss 

CLEVELAND contributed to too docu ment sent t Congress a year ago There is no individuality In It no picturesqueuoss no rheumatic emphasis oven nor ghoulish glee Tno only part of tho message which bears marks of careful elaboration with a view t literary effect Is tho chapter on civil service reform Here the phraseology has evidently been subjected to a polishing of subjetd t process con siderable duration It reads as if It had been written and rewritten weighed criticised pruned and Improved until what little life there was in the original draft was smother ed out under tho pressure of overconscious effort Yet this passage does not sound like tho undisputed productions ot tho Presidents own pen It sounds exactly like the editorial essays on the same subject which appear from tlmo to time in the columns of tho Eve Post ing Pal Our conjecture about the authorship the civil service reform department finds strong confirmation In the fact that this is the only part of the roossngo which receives the un qualified commendation of the Evening Pout Our esteemed contemporary quotes the passage sage In full and adds This Is all excellent It the conjecture Is accurate must I cnjeturo aurt we say that the President was less fortunate this year thou last In the choice of a collaborator PanElcctricf There Is no reference to tho PanElectric scandal In the part of Mr 

CLEVELANDS message devoted to tho Department of Jus tice nor in tho part devoted t patents Of the speculative and disgraceful use of tho name and money ot the United States In an attempt t break down a patent In order t bolster a wildcat company whose shares wero largely held by the AttorneyGeneral and other officials Mr CLEVELAND by omclwi 11 D says not a word But what could ho say that would b true I and not confess and condemn his failure to free his Administration from a wretched and I corrupt scandal I No more unsavory subject has ever been I passed over in silence by a President Wo are Inclined t think that among the greatest bid of good fortune that over hap pened to tbe citizens of the British Isles wa the building of thoi two olavtr yacht the Puritan and Hayflnwer In a dltouuion ot new rubs of maaauremtnt now uudw way a 1 I i r l r British TnchUtn think that If there be no Ilt t tue area o the nataiall tho national riff would toon b A sloop I melt freedom of thought Is tho result of a boot race a ersitt del t of mental activity must hats bon stirred up generally ii I old England Precedents have a binding effect In law nnd thoy exort trout Influence In polities Thli latter tact has long controlled PresidentIal nleetlonR and In many State notublr In New York I Is hardly loss potent In the choice of Bfenatort In Congress For example sInce
