President Harrison's Message is quite a lengthy document. He is not only willing to talk at all times but he is possessed of the cacoethei tcribendi to a marked degree. Daring the campaign be often showed himself to be a not inapt talker, and his last prodnction, though commonplace, is worded with consider able skill. He walks in the beaten track in following tbe trend of onr foreign affairs. He congratulates the conntry on the profound peace which prevails be tween the United States and all foreign nations, and dwells with special com •daoency upon the presence in Washing ton of the delegates who compose the Congress of the Three Americas, and the Maritime Conference, which is world wide in its attendance and significance. He recommends the raising of the rank of a number of our diplomatic representa tives to certain of the Spanish American Republics. The American people in the mass do not agree with such fantastical and monarchical notions, and would far rather see all our representatives abroad reduced to the rank of consuls or plain baainess agents. China and her young Emperor come in for a general mention, and this leads tbe President to a discus sion of Samoan affairs. He announces that a treaty is awaiting the action of Congress which involves a satisfactory adjustment of all tbe interesting ques tions respecting the Islands in contro versy batween the United States and European powers, and expresses his trust "that the efforts which have been made "to effect an adjustment of this question "will be productive of the permanent "establishment of law and order in "Samoa npon tbe basis of the mainte "nance of the rights and interests of the "natives." The Fisheries question and the Nica ragua canal come in for brief discussion, and after a general review of our foreign relations, in Which Turkey and Persia are accorded notice —it would seem to most people that a very powerful magni fying glass would be needed to see much importance in our intercourse with the latter power—the President next reaches what he styles, "Tbe Revolt in Brazil." He fails to explain what has become of Mr. Blame's Jingo policy, or why the government of the United States has been so gingerly in its recognition of a Sister Republic. The most astonishing portion of the message is that in which he essays to demonstrate that we are witnessing the closing of a very prosperons year. He founds this predicate on the general fact that the harvests have been good and the revenues of the government large. He says nothing about the unprecedent edly low price of corn or the unparalleled depression of manufactures and all kinds of industry, and the exceptional and op pressive tightness of the money market. The fact that bo much money has been coming from tho people by high war taxes, which they were illy able to pay, naturally leads him np to the surplus he admits to b > an evil on general principles, but by which he in reality stands. Taking all the various suggestions of the message on this head, the President's manner of getting rid of the surplus is practically that of Tom Pitch, via., "to blow it in." He believes iv withdrawing the national money now loaned to the banks and applying it to the purchase of bonds, and readers of the newspapers have noticed that Mr. Windom has already started in on this plan. He assumes to think that I the tariff ought to be reduced, but ir. effect he sticks staunchly to the doctrine; enunciated by the Chicago Convention though he dare not give them plain utter ance. That Ephraim is still pined to his idols, we can prove by a brief extract from this portion of the message: "The "removal of the Internal tax upon to "baeco would relieve an important agri "cnltural product from a burden which "wasimposed only because revenue from "customs was insufficient for tho public "needs. If safe provision against fraud "can be devised, the removal of the tax "npon spirits used in the arts and manu "factures would also offar an unobjec "tionable method of reducing the sar "plns." Upon the silver question Mr. Harri son comes out ftit-footedly not only against tbe free coinage of silver, but against coining the maximum amount of that metal permitted by the Bland bill. He makes the usual Wall street argu ment, and bis remedy for a curtailed currency and painfully restricted circula tion is, as far as silver is concerned, to have that bullion deposited in the vaults of the Government and silver certificates issued on the basis of its market value. In other words, the official hsad of the Republican party advocates a far more radical demonetization of that metal . than has existed since the great con spiracy of 1873. In his recommendations for extending onr Coast Defenses, building ships and plants to cast the modern armaments, the President will find many sympa thisers outside of his owa party. He takes advantage of the Terry-Field epi sode to get in his Federalist bias towards strengthening the national power and giving things a strong centralizing drift. He desires to see additional safeguards thrown around Federal Judges, jurymen and witnesses, and would have offenses against the parson or authority of any of these officials tried in the Federal courts. It is needless to add that he wants the Federal authorities to run the elections, and, in effect, favors the passage of the Blair Educational bill. Not even old Jobs Adsms himself corjld have written THE LOS 

ABTQELES DAILY HERALD. WEDNESDAY MOKJfIKQ. UECEMBEK 4. 1889. a message more thoroughly imbued with the old Federalist spirit. The balance of the message calls for very little detailed mention. It concerns itself with reviews of the reports of the several Secretaries, the Indian question, Oklahoma, the laad laws, and other topics on Tfhich both parties are substan tially agreed. The County's Money. Daring the past month of November the County Tex Collector has collected in the neighborhood of two hundred thou sand dollars. During the coming month the collections will amount to proba bly a round} million. The official into whose hands such vast sums of tho people's money passes, only gives a bond to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars. We have no desire to intimate anything'derogatory to Mr. R. S. Piatt, the County Tax Collector. For any thing we know, he may be the most hon est man in the world —a modern and local Aristides, so to speak— but it does not seem to us that bonds in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, with some of the bondsmen presumably liable to become financially embarrassed in the changes that often take place in Southern California of late years, are sufficient security for such an immense sum of money. The difficulty could be obvi ated, and ought to be obviated, by daily partial payments into the Connty Treas ury, and the taking of receipts for the same. Mr. Flatt ought to be willing to adopt this method of dealing with the county's cash, and in doing so he would be merely ] imitating bis predecessors, who all adopted that plan. There can be no possible barm in resorting again to this practice. It would release the Collect or's bondsmen and himself from a great responsibility, and it would un doubtedly give the taxpayers a guarantee that would be most acceptable to tbem. The only objection to such a proceeding would arise if the funds are being de voted to objects not contemplated by law. If they are being used for purposes of private speculation there would of course be a loud and energetic objection to the moneys being locked up in the hands of the County Tax Collector. We reespectfully dedicate these views to the mature consideration of that official. It is clearly announced that the Re publican majority of the House of Repre sentatives will make an attempt to chance the rule of that body which per mits one-fifth of the members to demand the yeas and nays on any question. It would perhaps be better to repeal that rule than to evade it after tbe style of tbe Republicans under the leadership of Thaddeus Stevens just after the war closed. That slave-driver of his party was determined to prees the force bill, which converted the Sonth into satra pies, through Congress, and he encoun tered a number of timid members of his own party who did not wißh to have their names go down to infamy thrcngh the official record. Stevens then deter mined to so organize the House as to bring the Democratic membership below the one-fifth obstructive rule, and this was done through the instrumentality of Congressional contests. Amongst the other members thrown out was Dan Voorhees, whose large majority was con temptously disregarded. But, though the country was shocked, rightfully elected Democratic members kept tumbling out of tbe Congressional windows until there was no possibility of calling the roll. It would be perhaps just as well to re strict the privilege of demanding the yeas and nays to three-fourths of the minority party, or, as parties may change, and there may be several minority parties, to one-th : rd of the membership of the House. But when the Republican party starts out to make any material change in the rules one may be sure tbat there is an African of formidable size in the political woodpile, and he will illustrate Darwin's theory cf evolution of the right tipae. There ia confronting the Board of Su pervisors just now, a difficulty which to many people looks like a grave one, and it arises from the creation ot Orange county. During the stages leading up to the formation and successful starting of the new political body corporate the taxes were assessed as of old, and tbe Tax Collector has collected a portion of the taxes due from that section. Under one theory it would look as if he ought to collect them all, or turn them in as delinquent. Others hold to the common sense theory that the difficulty can bo obviated by a resolution of our Board of Supervisors recognizing the existence ef the new county, and instructing the Tax Collector to turn the moneys held by him over to the person appointed by the Supervisors of Orange county to receive them. All questions of rebate and other issues could then be adjusted as to Orange county tax-payers with their own Board of Supervisors. Of course, there might be an issue raised as to whether or no Mr. Piatt would obey these instruc tions. His bond holders might have something'to say about the mitter, and the Tax Collector might hold on to the money. A sketch of the controversy ap pears in our local columns, and will re pay perusal. The press of the United States have lately oontained accounts of the serious illness of Mr. Jefferson Davis. The lat est dispatches have said that he is weak and sinking. As he is in his eighty fourth year this is not at all unlikely. Anyone who read the answer of tlie ex-Confederate to some strictures of Viscount Wolseley upon his (Davis's) actions as President of the "Lost Cause" would find it hard to accept the sick theory. A vigor and ferocity breathe through it hardly reconciliable with the invalid theory of his condition. Ik our local columns appear some ad ditional details of the plans of the Den ver & Bio Grande people to push their road to Los Angeles, in the shape of a letter from Mr. Taylor. It will repay 

FROM THE EAST. A. Horrible Discovery in a t Denver Tenement. [ i THE MINNEAPOLIS VICTIMS. ' t Further Argument in the Crouiu Cas2—Old TJmea Revived J at Leadville. 1 i I Asaoelßtal Press DlsDfttohes to tlie Hirald Dsn ver, Col., December 3. —A horrible discovery waj made here late tonight s which may yet prove to be a tragedy. About a year and a half ago Mrs. Ritchie, an old gray-haired woman about CO years ! of age, came here from Cheyenne, Wyo ming, accompanied by a young man of about 25, whom sho represented as her son, and a deaf and dumb daughter, aged about 15. They lived in various parts of the city until about two months ago when they engaged apartments at 1621 Stout street, where they lived a very re tired life. Three weeks ago the mother and son went on a protracted debauch. The old lady had not been seen for sev eral days, and her landlord becoming alarmed, broke open tbe door to her room tonight, and was horrified at finding the woman lying upon the floor by the side of her bed, dead with her face almost devoured by rats. The body was taken to tho Coroner's office for investigation tomorrow. The eon was found in an adjoining room in a beastly state ot intoxication, and was taken to the station-house, where he i now lies unable to speak or give an ac count of bimeelf. The dead woman is reported to have $20 000 deposited in the First National Bank. The family went ' to Cheyenne from Texas, and while living in Wyoming a son was mysteri ously murdered. It is said that the deaf snd dumb daughter knows who com mitted the crime, but refuses to divulge the secret, and no arrests have been made.

CniCAoo, December 3.—Judge Wing concluded his address to tbe Cronin jury this morning, devoting most of his atten tion to the argument that it was not shown that the wounds on Cronin's head were necessarily fatal, and tbat it was impossible to decide whether the speci mens of blood and hair examined by the experts were those of a human being or not. He was followed by Ingham in be half of the prosecution. Mr. Ingham spoke at length of the killing of Cronin and the disposal of the body, and defined and illustrated the ap plication of the law of conspiracy. Ad dressing himself to the question of the value of circumstantial evidence, he quoted legal opinions to the effect that it may be stronger than any direct evi dence. Judge Wing, he said, had taken up the evidence, bit by bit, and argued its weakness. This was simply the old story of the bundle of sticks. So it was in this case; each incriminating circum stance was explainable upon the theory of innocence, but combined the conclu sion to which they pointed was irreeisti ble. The circumstances from the time of the meeting in Camp 20 to the finding cf the clothes of Cronin in the sewer, showed an intelligent design. It had its origin in hate, its foundation in the charge that Cronin was a spy, and its end in his butchery in the Carlson cottage and his burial in tho sewer. Then Ingham proceeded to analyze the evidence, and gettine down to the Carlson cottage, said: "Why did Burke rent the cottage and hold possession of it, unoccupied month after month ? He was a day laborer and working only part of the time. Where was the brothers and sick sister who were to occupy tke cottage with him? Why did they not appear and testify in his behalf? Four or five people were to live in this cottage, yet it did not con tain a single article of kitchen fur niture. It was to attend one of O'Sullivan's men that a doctor was called. The cottage was close to O'Sul livan's house, and Burke told O'Sullivan about it as soon as he rented it. Subse quently O'Sullivan vouched for him." The speaker dwelt at length on the suspicious character of O'Sullivan's con tract for Cronin's services, tho hiring of the white iior-e. Cronin's suspicions actions, etc. He went over the ground I the ride to tho cottage, the murder, le subsequent bestowal of the body in le catch basin and flight. All this con eel ing chain of evidence lie said was in isputed. He touched upon the alibi testimony, nd showed that it was ail by friends of le accused, while tbe inculpating evi ence was by impartial witnesses. Ingham then proceeded to trace tbe snnection between Coughlin, Kunze nd O'Sullivm. He reviewed the fight etween Cronin and the Triangle as tho loving cause of the murder, aud closed 'ilh an appeal for conviction. FAUiflEltS AND f.AHOHEffS. in tin v Talk ol tin- Federation ot Cause*. St. Louis, December 3.—The annual lonvention of the Farmers and Laborers Jnion met here today with a large nnm ier of delegates in attendance. The Con ention was called to order by President ones, of Texas. After addresses of velcome the Convention assembled in ixecutive session. These meetings are obe secret. Delegates are present from Arkansas, Keutucky, Kansas, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, Oklaho na, Maryland, Alabama, Nebraska, 'forth Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana md Texas. Committees were appointed o confer with tho Northern Alliance on be formation of a National Alliance, and I in co-operation with the Farmers Mutual Benefit Association. The delegates to the convention of the Northern Alliance meeting held an in ormal conference this morning. Under he plan of consolidation with the Farm ers' and Laborers' Union, this body will probably adjourn to sit in that conven isn before the week is past. At a meeting of the Farmers' Alliance his afternoon, a committee was ap pointed to confer with a similar commit ee from the Farmers and Laborers' Union, to discuss the advisability of con tolidation. The majority of the commit tee are not in favor of consolidation. As o the proposed consolidation with the Knights of Labor, President Livingstone, )f the Georgia State organization, laid: "We propose to form an jffeneive and defensive alliance with the Knights of Labor, and co-cx>arate with them as long as it is mutually ad vantageous. If our paths leads us along the same road, it adds to the strength of both orders to work together. When nur ways diverge we can part in friend ship to meet further along in some other issue. lam not one of the principal ad vocates of co-operation with the Knights, but I can see an advantage to be derived from such a step." THE SEW CKTJIaKHS. They are not Uxtravag-ant Con sumers of Coal. ' Washington, December 3. —Secretary Tracy today denied the current report that the new naval cruisers are extrava gant coal consumers, and expressed a desire to have tho facts published. "The lepresentation that these vessels are heavy consumers of coal,"said Secretary Tracy, "is based upon their utmost con sumption while tinder forced draught, and," he continued, "war ships are sel dom under forced draught exc6pt on trial trips, when it is used to test their utmost capacity for speed, and they are never ngain likely to be placed under forced draught ex cspt possibly in the event of pursuit or of flight from an enemy. I don't sup pose that in the entire life cf the war ship she will be run under forced draught more than ha)/ a dozen times. As a matter of fact, the average coal consump tion of the new cruisers in making their ordinary speed of from eight to ten knots per hoar, is from twenty-five to thirty tons per day of twenty-four hours. As an illustration, the Boston on her last cruke steamed 200 miles per day for twenty-flvs days, and consumed only twenty-five tons of coal each day. This ihowe the average consumption of these vessels under ordinary conditions, and is ihe only proper test of their coal con sumption.

Baiiy Youngson.who has figured in several shooting scrapes, and was charged with the killing of Mart Dugan over a year ago. had some trouble with Frank Cole and the men Were looking for each other all yesterday, armed for a deadly battle. Early this morning, as Youngson was walking down Harrison avenue, accompanied by Bart Dudley, he met Cole and Clarence Wilverton. Cole and Youngson pulled their revolv ers and began firing at each other. The other two men also drew guns and took part in the battle. Some twenty shots were fired.

Evidence* of Shipwreck off Bcln ware Breakwater. New Yobx, December H.— an appall ing sight was witnessed in the water off Delaware breakwater about duck yester day evening by the crew of the Norwe gian bark Christian Scriver, which ar rived from Buenos Ayres to-day. The bark passed a huge raft on which were the bodies of two men dressed as sailors. They were dead and had been lashed to the logs of the raft. About three yards from the raft was the body of a middle aged woman encircled by a life preserver. Every effort was made to find out what vessel the raft belonged to, but the Cap tain was unable to do so. The receipt of the news in shipping circles occasioned no little excitement. Upon the maritime exchange the opinion prevailed that the raft and bodies bad come from tbe Old Dominion steamship Manhattan which wont down in a collision recently. The agents of that line, however, say there was not a woman on their vessel. Earthquake In New Hamnihlre. Dovbb, N. H., December 3.—Early this morning the inhabitants of Alton Bay were awakened by an earthquake. Many people rushed from their beds. Crockery and glassware were broken. Clocks stopped at 1:29.

The Telegraph is doubtful whether any important practical result can flow from the Pan-American project. THB i.i hi; it \ i, PLvrroßn. Ireland tne Leading; Question of tbe War. London, December 3.—At the Man chester meeting today Gladstone inspired great enthusiasm by his definite exposi tion of the Liberal policy. He said Ire land is the leading question of the day, and that the Tories would have been con verted to the Liberal view of the subject by this time, but for the dissi dent Liberals. The split in the Liberal party, he said, would not have occurred, except, for the personal ambition of some Tories and their allies, who desired more to form a national party than to do political jas tice. He severely arraigned the Union ist leaders on this point, and said the plan of campaign was the necessary consequence of the Government's refusal to grant proper relief to Ireland. There was, he said, less crime in Ireland than in England. He was of the opinion the country had clearly expressed the desire that there should be a change in the administration of Ireland, and the Liberals might look to the future in confidence. UinUSIUUD

They must revolve or stop with it, and could not determine things for themselves. It behooves them to consider well their position iv the light of the knowledge that with the settle ment of tho Irish question they will be extinct as a party. Resolutions were also adop'ed con demning any land purchase bill for Ire land which would entail a burden on British taxpayers; protesting against the usecf British lands to endow sectarian colleges in Ireland; approving interna tional aspiration. It was also declared as the sense of tho meeting that the British policy ought to be fo avoid any entanglement in continental quarrels."

In nearly every way-car some boxes of through freight wero found, and these were the boxes tampered with. The goods were always taken from freight consigned to points beyond the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. It is claimed a regular commission business wm done at Dayton by the suspected men.
