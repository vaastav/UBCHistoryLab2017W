I began to take it as directed in the pamphlet wrapped around the bottle. The book said if the disease was compli cated with cough to take Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery and ‘ Favor ite Prescription’ alternately, and Dr. Pierce’s Pleasant Pellets, on rising every morning. Mr. Brooks went back to the drug store and got the ‘ Golden Medical Discovery,* ana I took it as directed. The cough left me at once and I began to get better so rapidly my husband was astonished at my improvement. lam now able to work on the farm and also do the washing for two familes.” Bryan Prosperity. Three years ago Col. W. J. Bryan was a poor man. So poor, in fact, that it is admitted he was unable to meet the personal expense of his campaign for the presidency and contributions for his direct benefit were solicited and received by the national democratic committee. Since then, Mr. Bryan has made no pretense of practicing at his profession of law. With the exception of his brief military duty his whole time his been devoted to the further promulga tion of his theories by a book review ing campaign of 1896 and by lectures and speechmaking. It is not of record that Mr. Bryan has dene a stroke of work or exerted the least effort not re lating to his personal views of matters political. Everything he has done in three years has been with an eye single to the success in politics of his supporters and to the realization of his own am bition in 1900. Mr. Bryan today is possessed of. a personal fortune of $200,000. The statement is made on the authority of the New York Journal, the eastern newspaper organ of the gentleman from Nebraska. In other words, under three years of the beneficial adminis tration of William McKinley Mr, Bryan has risen from acknowledged poverty to admitted affluence. Two hundred thousand dollars equals the gross salary of the president of the United Stales for the full term of four years. It is an amount far in excess of that possessed by the great majority of the men who have entered the White House, and in great excess of the amount the most of them have been able to call their own upon leav** ing it.— Spokane Outburst. Fake bargains always attract the treasure of the simple-minded, the false Whether the stock in the trade be a plow, a suit of clothes, a stove or range, or a tin watch with glass jewels, the loquacious stranger can usually find willing victims where the responsible citizen, neighbor and taxpayer merchant —who sells reliable goods for honest profits and is always present to 'make good his guarantee when the irresponsible interloper has flown to unknown and unreaped fields —is restricted to the patronage of those who trust to recognized business responsibilities and do their trading with some dictation of common sense and are, therefore, never roped in by the traveling faker. Whatcom county has been a fruitful field for the smooth individual with the sweatshop clothes, copper gold, pewter silver and trick papers to be signed by the innocent victims to bind the “bargain.” Some public protection should be adopted— not for the sake of the chumps, but to save indirect expense to those who have no voice in the matter. —What- com Blade.

It was read at yesterday’s cabinet meet ing. It is the longest message e|§r ! sent to congress by President Mckln-’ ley, comprising more than 20,000 words. The most important features of the message relate to the new dependen cies and to the financial question. The essential features on these topics were thus outlined today by a member of the cabinet; Sovereignty is to be established throughout all the Philippine islands and not be permanently maintained, Civil government is to be extended throughout the islands as rapidly as possible ou lines somewhat similar to the arrangements affected for the gov ernment of the Island ot Negros. Attention is invited to the report of the Philippine commission as to why it is impossible for the United States ou par with the islands and as to the great commercial advantages in hold ing them. Civil government in Cuba under military control is recommended until some substantial progress has been made through the medium of suffrage toward the establishment of an inde pendent form of government. Attention is called to the fact that the census will not be completed until December 1, and as the Spaniards have under the treaty, until April next to decide whether they will become citi zens of the island, it will not be possi ble until that time to hold general elections to determine upon the fu ture government of the island. The question of annexation is, therefore, left open. Great stress is laid upon the improvement in the island during the year, not only commercially and agriculturally, but also in the sanitary condition of the cities and towns. President McKinley recommends that civil government immediately re place the military in Porto Rico—a civil governor to be appointed and a council or legislature to be elected by the people, property and educational qualifications to be prescribed for vot ers. As to Hawaii, the president suggests immediate legislation to put in effect a territorial form of government, and the modification of the pending bills to correspond more nearly with the political government of the islands. The Hague conference is pointed to with satisfaction and a statement made that the treaty agreed to at this conference will be submitted at once to the senate. Gratification is express ed over the final settlement ot the Venezuelan boundary controversy. Samoa comes in for a large share of at tention, the exciting events of the year are reviewed and the statement made that a new treaty will soon be sent to the senate for the partition of Che is lands. The president refers to the trade sit uation in China and the verbal assur ances received by this government from powers having spheres of influ ence in that empire that American trade rights will be respected. He will also announce that he has re quested that these verbal assurances be placed in writing but beyond stat ing that favorable answers are expect ed he will be unable to inform con gress that ho has received the formal communications desired. His Condition Far Worse It is a full century since the colored races of Hayti threw off the rule of France, apd from that time to this the country has been deteriorating. Prosperity went out with foreign rule, the ethics and institutions of advanced civilization not being applicable to in ferior races, when the administration of affairs is lei*, to a people ignorant and naturally lazy and incompetent. Left to himself the tropical black man will not work so long as food can be obtained and the swarming increase fed without work. As compared with former times the island appears to be in ruins; where once was busy indus try and extensive commerce, are now dilapidated plantations, abandoned mines, and rotting wharves and ware houses. The chronic condition of politics and society is revolution and revolting crime, with rank corruption in every branch of the government. Commerce is not encouraged, industry is declining, and intercourse with white men and foreigners is not de sired. A century of trials is here suf ficient to show that the trufric'al negro, under European forms of government, gradually declines, until a sfate of thin# "Is reached far worse Ilian bis in Africa.—The ’.MiSS ,'Wv - , .

In reply, I would respectfully stale that the proper course for such settlers to pursue would seem to he to continue their settlements and within three months after the acceptance and offic ial filing of the plat of survey of the lands to assert their claims thereto by proper applications to enter, at the local land office. Upon such applica tions, and a satisfactory showing, after due notice to the railroad company, that their settlements were initiated prior to and existing at the date of the company’s lieu selections, the settlers would have the superior right to the lands, as lieu selections by the com pany in the presence of valid adverse claims are inhibited by said acts. Your correspondent’s inquiry as t6 the present status of the suspended surveys of the lands aforesaid will be answered in a separate letter. Very respectfully, Binger Hermann, Commissioner. Some Mighty Big Things The year 1899 is bound to go down the centuries as one ot the greatest in all the history of this nation, says the Seattle Times, —and here are a few facts to demonstrate this proposition to which special attention is respect fully called: “One million and a half tons of steel rails, 30,000 cars and 500 locomotive were ordered in the United States dur ing the last week in October. In the same week the description of the most powerful locomotive ever constructed was published. The weight, with the tender, was 364,000 pounds, and it is designed to haul 2000 tons. “A few weeks ago the largest steam ship in the world arrived in New York after a successful maiden voyage, and it is now staled that the Great North ern Railway has already contracted in England for two steel steamships which will be sixteen feet longer than the new “Oceanic” of the White Star Line. It is furthermore reported that these two are but the fore-runners of a large fleet of equally gigantic steel steamships for the trans-Pacific trade between Seattle and Japan. “When the Baldwin Locomotive Works installed two gigantic electric traveling cranes, having a lifting ca pacity of 100 tons each, in their erect ing shops a few years ago, these labor saving appliances were the cause of much wondering comment among engineers and others; but mofe recent ly the Carnegie Steel Company caused to be built (for its Homestead plant) an electric traveling crane having a lifting capacity of 150 tons, and it is said that no more difficulty is exper ienced in the operation of the mon strous mechanism than in the case of the smaller cranes. “On the New York Central the other day, a locomotive, No. 948, one of the new moguls, hauled out train No. 11, the Southwestern Limited, made up of two mail cars, live passenger coaches and nine Wagner cars, sixteen in all. The total weight of the train was 1,832,000 pounds, or 916 tons, and the length of the train, including the en gine, was 1212 feet, or nearly a quarter of a mile. This engine, it is said, made the regular time of the tram be tween New York and Albany, 143 miles, in three hours and • fifteen minutes.” Under the initiative and referendum a very small vote was polled in Missis sippi on the proposition for an elective instead of an appointive judiciary. The Mississippi yeomen are not dis posed to give up recognized cinch for anything so uncertain as the referend um, thinks the Vancouver Columbian. -* i j 5rr f ; : iq isiwuoJ., aim ■«m»» y iL ■ 3r •snfccess of the oampaigjaL_in theThilip- sludumtgfdbg MKa tffijt cd b*neftigfc- ; X9v Xfls 9^ocaJlfc(bgoveroni©m)ii**iS(mera. mi' W lodksibbsv ;> taceks ago, T. ioswrreffitioiu. would l T V& jchoAby.Odmp bwce ij©wiign»B asaem- >1 l( In ficty * ■mi i as already far as organ-bf* l( The end*Y mgj {nil spike thb mi. guns dfcanapyoabilhe.aalla in it ami they willrHa\e(t£l(Jinnt a new sub- p.' ject for \m The senate finances Committee, or-mt rather the republican membersOf that committee, held a meeting today to <> consider the financial bill prepared by the Republican House Caucus com mittee. So far, the senators have not agreed to accept the bill as drawn by the House committee, of which Col. Henderson is chairman, as a whole, although agreeing to the principal points therein, and the House commit tee has declined to drop their bill and adopt the one prepared by the sena tors. Present plans for handling this bill in the House do not contemplate its being referred to a committee. In fact, it may be passed by the House before the committee are announced, although Col. Henderson has said that he would announce the ’committee be fore the holiday recess. The Caucus committee will report the bill to the republican caucus that will be held at , the end of the week, to nominate offi cers of .the House and it is expected that the caucus will endorse the bill, and adopt a resolution in favor of its being reported directly to the House, as a caucus measure, and passed. The expulsion of representative-elect Roberts, of Utah from the House, which is probable anyway, will become an absolute certainty if the Mormons continue such tactics as making boasts that they have secured pledges from a sufficient number of members to pre vent the adoption by the necessary two thirds vote of a resolution for his expulsion. The only possible show that Roberts has to retain bis seat lies in bis ability to convince mem bers that the mormons are not respon sible for bis nomination and election, and not interested in having him keep his seat, and it may be imagined what that show will be when this Mormon boast becomes generally known among members. A number of them have already expressed the opinion that such talk, of itself, was valid ground for the expulsion of Roberts. A plan of keeping Roberts out of the House, has been suggested, and if the clerk of ’ • the House, who presides until the :; i Speaker is elected, agrees to it, only a / J majority vote would be required. This ' >r -i plan is to raise an objection when he 11 presents himself to be sworn in. If i! 1; 1 the clerk entertains this objection, the ; House could either sustain the objec tion, or refer the matter to a Commit tee for investigation and report. Ih ‘ i either case, a majority vote would <u;:i keep Roberts out. There are, how- ' ever, serious objections to this plan, 11 - and it may not be adopted. Representative-elect Clayton, of L New York, who was elected to Oongrt^-1 0 " as a democrat, has been expressing opinions which show that he isn't the same kind of democrat that Mr. Bryan is. Mr. Clayton says he favors gold U standard legislation by this Congress, 1 and will vote ior the bill. He also an nounces that he favors President Mc- Kinley’s foreign policy, the construe- 1 ' s tion of an Isthmian Canal, and the holding of the Philippines for all time, ' in order to be sure of getting our 1 of the immense trade of South i era Asia. As the national parties are ~ today alined upon important, issues,. ( Mr. Clayton is a pretty good republi- ’ . can, even if he does call hihfifstelr ‘a democrat. i Secretary Root’s annual report, just ■«! completed, takes strong ground, in favor . of the immediate appointment of <?ivil . governors for Porto Rico and C/üba, , . and it is regarded as probable that the • r appointments will be .is made before the first of al- •, TM though in the case of Cuba, there,.,is,. , much opposition.
