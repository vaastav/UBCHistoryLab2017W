President't Message concluded from first paqe- The revenue system of the country ißa sub- ) ject of vital interest to its honor and prosperi- 1 ty, and should command the earnest conside- 1 ration of Congress. The Secretary of the ! Treasury will lay before you a full and de tailed report of the receipts aud disbursements 1 oi ibo last fiscal year, of the first quarter of the present fiscal year, of the probable receipts- i and expenditures for the other three quarters and the estimates for the year following the 30th of June, ISG6. 1 might content myself; with a pefeyence to that report, in which you j will find all the information required for your deliberations arid dochsictn. Hut the para mount importance of the subject so presses itself on my own mind, that I cannot but lay before you my views of the measures which are required for the good character, and, I might ulrnost say, for the existence of this people. The life of a republic lies certainly iu the energy, virtue, and intelligence of its citizens; but it is equally true that a good revenue system is the life of an organin d government. I meet you at a time when the nation has voluntarily burdened itself with a debt unprecedented iu our annals. Vast as is its amount, it fades away into nothing when compared with the countless blcsoiug3 that will be conferred it; on our country and upon tnsn by the preservation of the nation's life. Now, on the first occasion of tho meeting of Caugress since the return of peace, it is of the utmost importance to inaugurate a just policy which shail at once be put in motion, aud which shall commend itself to those who come aferusforits continuance. Wo must aim at nothing less than tho complete cfi'ncement of the financial evils that necessarily followed a state of civil war. We must cndcavar to apply the earliest remedy to the deranged state of tho currency, and not shrink from de vising a policy which, without being oppres sive to the people, shall immediately begin to effect a reduction of the debt, and, if persisted In, discharge it fully within a definitely fixed nnmhor of years. it is our first duty to prepare in earnest for our recovery from the ever-increasing evils of an irredeemable currency, without n sudden revulsion, and yet without untimely pneras tinstion. For that end we must, each in our respective positions, prepare the way. 1 bold it the duty of the Executive to insist upon frugality in the expenditures; and a sparing economy is itself a great national resource. Of the "banks to which authority lias been given to issue notes secured by bonds of the United States, we may require tb" greatest moderation and prudence, and the law must be rigidlv enforced when its limits arcexceed ed. We may, each one of us, counsel our active and enterprising countrymen to be constantly on their guard, to liquidate debts Dearly as possible on a system of cash pay ments or short credits, to hold themselves prepared to return to the standard of gold and silver. To aid our fellow-citizens in the pru dent management of their monetary affairs, I tho duty devolves on us to diminish by law the amount of paper money now in circulation Five years ago the bank-note circulation of the conntry amounted to not much more than two hundred millions; now the circulation, bank and national, exceeds seven hundred millions. The simple statement of the fact recommends more strongly than any words of mine could do the necessity of our restraining this expansion The gradual reduction of the currency is the only measure that can save the business of tho country from disastrous calamities; and this can be almost impercepti bly accomplished by gradually funding the national circulation in securities that may be mado redeemable at the pleasure of the Gov ernment Our debt is doubly secure—first in the ac tual wealth aud still greater undeveloped re sources of the eouutry,; and next in the char acter of our institutions. The most intelligent observers amoog political economists have not failed to remark that the public debt of a country is safe in proportion as its people are free, that the debt of a republic is the safest of all. Our history confirms aud establishes the theorv, and is, I firmly believe, destined to give it a still more signal illustration. The rcerct of this superiority springs not merely from the fact that in a republic tho national obligations are distributed more widely through countless numbers in all classes of society; it has its root in the character of our laws. Here all men contribute to the public burdens. During the war, under the impul ses of patriotism, the mm of the great body of the people, without regard io their own comparative want of wealth, thronged to our armies and filled our fleets of war, and held themselves ready to offer their lives for the public good. Now, in their turn, the pro perty and income of the eouutry should bear the ir just proportion of the burden of taxation, while in our impost system, through means of which increased vitality is incidentally impart ed to all the industrial interests of the nation the duties should he so adjusted as to fall most heavily oo articles of luxury, leaving the necessaries of life as free from taxation as tho absolute wants of the Government, economi cally administered, will justify. No favored class should demand freedom from assessment and the taxes should he so distributed as not to fall unduly on the poor, but rather on the accumulated wealth of the country. Wo should look at the national debt just as it is— not as a national blessing, but as a heavy burden on tho industry of the country, to he discharged without unnecessary delay. It is estimated by tho Secretary of the Treasury that the expenditures for the fiscal year ending tho 30th of June, 18GG will ex ceed tho receipts §112,134,947. It is grati fying, however, to state that it is also esti mated that the revenue for tho year ending the 30th of June, 18G7, will exceed the ex penditures in tho sum of §111,G82,815. This amount, or so much as may be deemed suffi cient for the purpose, may he applied to the reduction of the public debt, which, on the 31st day of October, 1805; was $£2,740,854,- 750. Every reduction will diminish the to tal amount of interest to be paid, and enlarge the means of still further reductions, until the whole shall be liquidated; and this, as will be seen from the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury, may bo accomplished by annu al payments even within a period not exceed ing thirty years. I have faith that wo shall do all this within a reasonable time; that, as we have amazed the world by the suppression of a"®ivil tfhV Wjiich was thought' rt bo be yond'MtrofltrOT of any government; so we shall equally show the S'npeKd'riiy of mir in stitatloDs by the prompt and faithfdb discharge of our. national obligations. . - Tho Depirtmerft df Agrienlture, trader Its Srcsertt direction, is accomplishing "much in evelflpingund utilizing tho vast agrimrltdfal i capabilities of the ommtry, and for information respecting tho details of its management rcf erenco is mado to tlio annual report of the Commissioner. ' • I have dwelt thus fully on out domestic affairs because of their transcendent import ance; Under any circumstances, our great extent of territory and variety of climate, pro ducing almost everything that is necessary for the wants, and even the comforts of man", make ha singularly independent of the vary- \ ingpoljcy of foreigb Powers, and protect nj awjipA every temptpfion '"entangling- alii- ! -15®;" ultbq mrieot moment ihe-es, 1 - tablisnment of fcfchcijj, trati<Ttrs6renfcth that 1 womeetrftttrtaftnohy, wfllbo oirberft security i again* "nations wio'foel pdwe? and forget] right." For myself, has been and it will 1 be my constant aim to promote peace and j amity with all foreign nations and Powers, and 1 have every reason to believe that they all, .without exception, are animated by the same disposition. Our relations with the Emperor of China, so recent iu their .origin, are most frieudly, Our commerce with hie dominions is receiving uew developments; and it is very pleasing to find that the Government of that great empire manifests satisfaction with our policy, and rcposcsjust confidence in the fairness which marks our intercourse. The unbroken harmony between the United States and the Emperor of Russia is receiving a new support from an enterprise designed to carry telegraphic lines atxoss tho continent of I Asia, through his dominions, and so to con- | nect us with all Europe by a new channel of of intercourse. Our commerc- with South ] America is about to receive encouragement j by a direct line of mail steamships to the | rising Empire of Brazil. The distinguished party of men of science who have recently loft our country to make .ft scientific explora tion of the natural history atnl rivers and mountains ranges of that region have received from the Emperor that generous welcome which was to have been expected from his constant friendship for the United States, and his well-known zeal in promoting the ad vancement of knowledge. A hope is enter tained that our commerce with the rich and and populous countries that border the Medi terranean sea may be largely increased. Noth ing will he wanting, on the part of tiiis Gov ernment, to extend the protection of our flag over the enterprise of our fellow citizeus. We receive from the Powers in that region as surances of good-will; and it is worthy of note that a special envoy has brought us messages of condolence on the death of our late Chief Magistrate from the Bay of Tunis, whose rule includes the old dominions of Carthage, on the African coast. Our domestic contest, now happily ended, has left some traces in our relations with one at least of the great maritime powers The formal accordance of belligerent lights to the insurgent State was unprecedented, and lias not been justified by the issue But in the systems of neutrality pursued by the Powers which mado that concession, there was a marked difference. The materials of war for the insurgent States were furnished, in a great measure, from the workshops of Great Britain; and British ships, maimed by British subjects, and prepared for receiving British armaments, sailed from the ports of Great Britain to make war on American commerce, under the shelter of a commission from the insurgent States These ships, having once escaped from British ports, ever afterwards entered then in every part of the world, to refit, and sn to renew their depredations The consequences of this conduct were most disas trous to the States then in rebellion, increas ing their desolation and misery hy the pro longation of our contest. It had, moreover, the effect, to a great extent, to drive the American flag from the sea, aud to transfer much of our shipping and our commerce to the very Power whose subjects had created the necessity fur such a change. These events took place before I was called to tho adminis tration of the Government. Tho sincere de sire for peace by which 1 am animated led me to approve the proposal, already made, to sub mit the questions which had thus arisen be tween the countries to arbitration. The ques tions are of such moment that they must have commanded tho attention of the Great Powers, and are so interwoven with the peace and interests of every one of them as to have insured an impartial decision. 1 regret to inform you that Great Britain declined the arbitrament, but, on the other hand, invited us to the formation of a joint commission to settlo mutual claims betwecu the two coun tries, from which those for the depredations before mentioned should bo excluded. Tho proposition iu that very unsatisfactory form lias been dcelinod. The U 'nited States did not present the sub ject as an impeachment of the good faith oi a Power which was professing the most friendly disp ■>; itions. but as involving questions of public law. of which the settlement is essen tial to tiie peace of nations; and, though pecu niary rcparration to their injured citizens would have followed incidentally on a decis ion against Great Britain, sucli compensation was not their primary object. They had a higher motive, and it was the interests of peace and justice to establish important principles of international law. The correspondence will be placed before you. The ground on which the British Minister rests his justifica tion is substantially that the municipal law ot a nation, and the ! a.stie interpretations of that law, are the measure of its duly as a neutral ; and i feci bound to declare my opin ion, before you and before tho world, that that justification cannot he sustained before tin tribunal of nations At the same time Ido not advise to any present attempt at redress br acts of legislation. For the future, friendship between the two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice. From tho moment of the establishment of our free Constitution, the civilized world has been convulsed by revolutions in tlio interests of democracy or of monarchy, hut through all those revolutions the United Slates have wise ly and firmly refused to become propagandists of republicanism. It is the only government suited to our condition; hut we have never sought to impose it on others; and we have consistently followed the advice of Washing ton, to recommend it only by the careful pre servation and prudent use of the blessing.— During all the intervening period the policy of European Powers and of the United States Imp, on the whole, been harmouious. Twice indeed, rumors of the invasion of some parts of America, in the interests of monarchy, have prevailed; twice my prcdesessors have had oc casion to announce the views of this nation in respect to such interference. Oa both oc casions the remonstrance of the United Srates was respected, from a deep conviction on the part of European governments that the system of noil interference and mutual abstinence from probagandism was the true rule for tho two hemispheres. Since those times we have advanced in wealth ahd power; hut we retain the same purpose to leave the nations of Ku to cliooso tneir own dynasties and form their own systems of government. This consistent moderation may justly demand a correspon ding moderation. We should regard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to the cause of goW govern me i it, and to-the pence of the world, should any European Power challenge •the Amorlenft people; as it were, to the de fence of republicanism against foreign -inter ference. We eaansl foresee ami nr9 unwil ling to- consider what opportunities might ; present themselves', what combination* might offer to protect ourselves against, designs in- I imienl -te our form of government. The ! United States de.-iro to act ift tho future as they have ever acted heretofore ; they never ! will be driven froifi that course but by the I aggression of European Powers ; and rely ou the wisdom and justice of those Powers to respect the system of non-interference which has so long been sanctioned by time, and whii-h, by its good results, has approved it self to both continents. Tho correspondence between tho United States sind France, in reference to questions which have h'eeome subjects of discussion be tween ; thr two Governments, will, ftt a proper trnj*. be laid before Congress. When, on' the organization of oar Govern - j meat, under the Constitution, the President of the United States delivered his inaugural address to the two Houses of Congress, ho said to them, and through thom to the coun try and to mankind, that "the preservation ' of the faered fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of Government arejustly ' considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the American people." And the house of Representatives answered Washington bv the voice of Madison: " We adore the Invisible Hand which lias led the American people, through so many diffi culties, to cherish a conscious responsibility for the destiny of Republican liberty." More than seventy-six years have glided away since these words were spoken ; the United States have passed through severer trials than were foreseen; and now, at this new epoch in our existrnce as one nation, with our Union pu rified by sorrows, and strengthened by con flirt, and established by the virtue of the peo ple, greatnes of the occasion invites us once more to repeat, with solemnity, the pledges of our fathers to hold ourselves answerable) before our fellow men for the success of the ! republican form of Government Experience has proved its sufficiency in pcaee and in war; | it has vindicated its authority through dan-1 govs, and afflictions, aud sudden and terrible emergencies, which would have crushed any system that had been less firmly fixed in the heart of the people. At tho inauguration of Washington the foreign relations of the coun try were few, and its trade was repressed by hostile regulations: now all the civilized na tions of the globe welcome our commerce, and their governments profess towards us amity. Then our country felt its way hesitatingly along an untried path, with States so little bound together by rapid means of communi cation as to be hardly known to one another, and with historic traditions extending over very few years; now intercourse between the States is swift and intimate ; the experience of centuries lias been crowded into a few gen erations, and has created an intense, inde structible nationality. Then our jurisdiction did not reach beyond the inconvenient boun daries of the territory which had achieved in dependence ; now, through cessions of land, first colonized liy Spain and France, the country lias acquired a more complex charac ter, and has for its natural limits the chain of Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, and on the east and the west the two great, oceans. Other j nations were wasted by civil wars for ages before tliey could establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity; the latent eonvic i lion that our form of Government is the best over known to the world lias enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years, with a complete vindication of the constitu tional authority of the General Government, and with our local liberties and State institu tions unimpaired. The throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores are witnesses of tlur, confidence of all peoples in our permanence. Hero is the great land of free labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards, and the bread of the workingniau is sweetened by the consciousness that the cause of the conntry " is his own cause, his own safety, his own dignity." Hero every one enjoys the free use of his faculties and tho choice of activity as a natural right. Here, under the combined influence of a fruitful soil, genial climes, and huppy institutions, population has! increased fifteen-fold within a century. Here, i through tho easy development of boundless resources, wealth has increased with two-fold ■ greater rapidity than numbers, so that we have become secure against the Gnnneiul vi-, cissitudes of other countries, and, nliko in business and in opinion, are self-centered and truly independent. Here more and more care is given to provide education for every one born on our soil. Hero religion, released from political connection with the civil gov ernment, refuses to subserve tho eraft of statesmen, and becomes, in its independence, the spiritual life of the people. Here tolera tion is extended to every opinion, in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory Here the human mind goes forth unshackled iti the pursuit of science, ' to collect, stores of knowledge and acquire an ever-increasing mastery over the forces of nature Here the national domain is offered and held in millions of separate freeholds, so that our fellow-citizens, beyound tho occu pants of any other part of the earth, consti tute in reality a people. Ilero exists the democratic form of government ; and that form of Government, by the confession of European statesmen, " gives a power of which no other form is capable, because it incorporates every man with the State, and arouses everything that belongs to the soul." Where, in past history, dors a parallel ex ist to the public happiness which is within tlie reach of the people of the United States? Where, in any part of the gl ■he. can institu (ions he found so suited to their habits or so entitled to their love as their own free Con stitution? Every one of thorn, then, in what ever part of the land lie has his homo, must wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not now nrliti iwledgc, in the words of Washing ton, that '• every step by which the people of the United States have advanced to the char acter of an independent nation seems to have horn distinguished hv some token of Provi dential agency ?" Who niil not join with me in the prayer, that the Invisible Hand which has led us through the clouds that gloomed around our path will so guide us onward to a perfect restoration of fraternal affection, that wo of this day may be able to transmit our groat inheritance, of State governments in all their .lights, of the Genera! Government in its whole constitutional vigor, to our posterity, and thoy to theirs through countless genera tions ?
