I am thus prevented from presenting in as erect a way as I could wish the many que.-iioiis mat are preK.-ing lor solution at this tine Happily, 1 have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch witli affairs in their ib tall and whose thougiii'u. roeniniiionita Pons i earnestly second. ill the matter of the railroads an the readjustment ol their allairs crow ing out of federal control, I dtull take the liberty at a late date ol' address ing you. The Budget System. 1 hope thai Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legisi.it urn looking toward the establishment of n budget system. That there should be one single authority responsible lor the making of all appropriations an I that appropriations should be made tVbt. Independently of each other, but with reference to one single compre hensive plan of expenditures properly related lo the nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burd ens of preparing the budget must. In the nature of the case, if the work 1 to lie properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of divided rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should lie submitted to and approved or amended by a single com mit me of each house of Congress ali.i no single appropriation should b'' made bv the Congress except such as may have been Included In the buduet riruiu.ri.rt bv Ihe executive or added hv the particular committee of cote: gress charged with the budget legis lation. Another and not less important as pect of the problem is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. I'mler existing law Ihe only audit is lor the purpose of ysrer - tainlng whether expenditures havo been lawfully made within the alM'i'op rlatlotis.

The Tariff and Industry. The problem Is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of America in the .world's affairs. The prejudice and passions engen dered ly the decades of controversy betweon two schools of political and economic thought the one belief re sult in protection of American indus tries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only- must tt subordinated to the single consideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed conditions. Ilefore the war America was heavily the debtor of the. rest of the world and the Inter est payments she had to make to foreign countries on American secur ities held abroad, the expenditures of American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges shevjiad to pay to others about balanced the value of I her pre-war favorable balance ol I trade, pin ing the war America's ex j ports have been greatly stimulated. and increased prices have increased ! their value. On ihe other baud she has purchased a large proportion of -tlie American securities previously held abroad, has loaned sumo $:i,0 o. imii.imiiii to foreign goverrrments and lias built her own ships. Our favor able balance of trade litis thus been greatly increased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meet ing it heretofore existing. Europe can have only three ways of meet ing the favora.blo balance of trade in peace times: liy imports into this country of gold or of goods, or by ,i-luhlishing new credits. Europe is in no position at the present time to ship gold to us nor could we contem plate large further imports of gold into this country without concern. The time lias nearly passed for inter national governmental loans and it will lake lime to dnvelop ill tills Colin try a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend to prevent foreign count no.--from settling for our exports by ship ments of goods into this country could only have the nffect of preventing them from paying for our exports and therefore of preventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country greatly st iimilated by the war. must Hud an outlet by ox ports to foreign countries ami any measures taken to prevent Imports will inevitably curtails exports, force curtailment of production, load the banking machinery of the country with credits to curry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want : we must lie prepared to buy to sell What- ever, therefore, may havi been our views during the period of growth of American business concerning tariff legislation we must now adjust our own economic life to a changed con dition growing out of the fact that American business is full grown and that America is the greatest capital j st in the wor!,! in the wor!.!. Hints at League Possibilities. No policy the growing of isolation will satisfy needs and opportllllitli 'of America The provincial standards Ihii past, which have business as if in a straight jacket, must yield and givi way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live day full of .hope and promise, for American btislness If we will tint take advantage of the opportunities that are ours for the asking.
