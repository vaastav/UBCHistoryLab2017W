STATE PISH -COMMISSIOff. Their Annual Eeport to the Governor. A Comprehensive Statement of Existing Facts. The state fish commission have sub mitted their annual report to Gov. Pennoyer. Following are the most salient fea tures of the report, the extracts be ing somewhat cendensed: After referring to other reports, of commissioners of different states, exhibiting the absolute necessity of fish propagation, and the good effects resulting thQrofroin. the commissioners sa "The catch of &ahnon in Oregon fori tLe past season will fall -somewhat short of the catch for the ?Gan of 'S8. There has been packed on the Co lumbia river, including the Washing ton side, 328,000 cases, or 15,600,000 T&imAa ehiiih rrnnMi V-omro nftnnl.

The shortage ia mostlj from the vicinity of the Tnoininr ru Tnn i neranpe and was owing to the extremely low .v v,. .w w w.,, , water, which prevented more than one half of the fish wheels from taking any fish, and many of those that did take fish, only ran for a short time, and caught but few fish. The other streams on the coast of Oregon, which have been fished dur ing the season, have turned out fairly well: The pack on the Nehalem was about 6000 cases; Tillamook, 9,500 cases; Nestucca, 6,700 cases; Yaquina, 5,000 cases: Alsea, 10,000 casen: Siu slaw. 12.000 cases; Umpqua, 12,000 cases; Coquille, 8,G00 cases; llogue river, 22,000 cases; 14.000 al which were spring salmon. As nearly as wo have been able to ascertain, the following amount of gear has been used on the Columbia river during the past season. About 1,500 gill nets have been operated, the average length of each being 300 fathoms; depth -L fathems: these are used all along the river from the bar to the Cascades; a great tyiqtiv ca4- "nala nra Tien1 TtriiM nn in4 ilUUM GKV liUtO UiU VL3UU 1TJJXUU IUV illU included here.

They are used from Bridal Veil Falls, to the Cascades, a distance of 20 miles, and again from Three mile creek, to Celilo a distance of 10 miles; number of square miles fished bj- wheels, 20. At the close of our last annual re port we had turned out from the Clackamas station about 1,000,000 young fish, and still had -1,500,000 egg, and young fr in the hatching house. Owing to the mild weather during the winter we had oxcellent success with the eggs, and young fry, and by the 1st of February, all had been turned out, amounting in all, for the season, to more than 5,500,000 young salmon, or more than three times the number of fish taken on the whole river during the season. The young fish were all let loose 'in tho Clackamas river with the exception of 40,000, which were taken to the Columbia, and let loose at Bonneville. We think it would have been better to have taken more of them to the Co- lumuia, but we could not do .-o, as the expense was quite large, and we were short of funds. In connection with hatching and distributing young fish we wish to call your attention and tho attention of the public to the great work of the "United States fish commission. , We will now call your attention to tne work or the u. o. ucm. at lilu: o ptiriosu ut uutuuuuj; h.u the Clackamas station.

It is safe to say that there will y planted in the waters of the st.ute as this season's work -1.250,000 young sal- I mon. And from conversation with I Commissioner McDonald during his ! visit we may expect in the near future to see the capacity of the TJ. S. fish breeding stations on this coast in- I creasea ana new ones erecieu, "We have noticed that in all states where fish breeding has been started, that the state commissioners have worked in connection with tho U..S. commission, and think that far better results can be obtained with "the same expenditure of money by so doing. In connection with fish breeding wo will say that we took some salmon eggs from the Clackamas station and had them on exhibition at tho Indus trial fair at Portland. The people look a great intcrst in them more especially after they liegan to hatch and the young fish could be seen moving around. But in a few days after they were hatched out they were killed, owinjr to a . defect in the connections of (he water supply, hot water being run through tlie pipes. We also placed somo eggs on board the TJ. S. commissioners steamer Al batross, which was stationed at Port land ten days during the- fair, the eggs hatched out and the young fish thrived well. This goes to show that the water in the vicinity of Portland is not poisoned to such an extent by the sewerage of the city as to kill young salmon, as has been argued heretofore as one great objection to the Clackamas as a breeding station; for the water in which the eggs were hatched and the young salmon lived when on board the steamer was pumped from nearAthe. bottom of the Willamette, close' fo the" wharves ,in the city of Portland.

This is a shortage from the pack of '88 of 33,000 cases, 20,000 or which we have already accounted for in the vi cinity of the Cascades. The coast streams aro short the balance, not so much on account of the scarcity of fish (the run being an, average one in all ibe coast streams, and the fish of better quality than in foimer years) as or a falling market, and the packers did not care to han dle the fish unless there was a small profit made on them. The statistics given thus far are for salmon that have been packed in tin cans, when we add to this the amount u-ed freh in our homo markets, which is about 1,000,000 pounds; and tho3e t. .. '. i'i lll f'j l" icpiuuui iuueimcu uyv for their winter use, it will swell uio sum bv at least 2,000,000 pounds, mak ing a grand total of 25,101,600 pounds of salmon that have been taken from our waters during the the season of 1889. Now let us see what the commercial value of this industry is to the state. There have been packed 426,800 cases in tin cans, of these 300,000 cases were first class goods and sold at an average of $6.25 per cases or $1,875,000, 126,800 cases were second quality, or fall salmon and sold at an average of $5.00 per case, or $634,000. making the total value of salmon packed in tins on the Columbia river and streams wholly within the state $2,509,000. The 2,500,000 pounds that have been shipped east and consumed in our home markets fresh can safely be considered worth 8 cts per pound making $200,000 which added to the $2,509,000 for canned goods make-i a grand total of $2,709,000. As will bo seen by the foregoing figures the salmon industry of this state is of vast importance and should receive more consideration from the general public than the other. Why? Because thus far it has cost nothing to produce the salmon that have been taken from year to year, they have neither had to be fed or sheltered, sowed or reaped we were about to say. But alas! while the sowing has begun but recently, the reaping has been going on for more than thirty years, but the time 13 near at hand when the harvest will surelv fail un less more attention is given to planting fn rmr lfJ- ronnrf ro (Kiw ormm facts in regard to planting galmoil in , the Bogue river and the results ob- tained therefrom. The good worjc is ; still going on there, as about 250,000 vouug nsn were planted there last season, with a fair prospect for nearlv a million for this season .There has been some talk through tlie newspapers and otherwise in re gard to illegal obstructions being placed across Bogue river at or near its, mouth.

Now : to impress the importance of planting iisu more limy upon uiu minus in an who may read this, and to convince those who may have some doubts as to the results of fish culture, we ;wll I refer you to the salmon pack .of the British Columbia. We quote from tho report of Mr. Thomas Mowal in spector of fisheries for the province : of British Columbia. He says there has beeu turned out from tho hatchery ou the Fraser river since it commenced operations the following numbdr'of fry. x , Year. 18S5 1,800,000 18S6 2,025,000 18S7 4,4U,000 1838 ". .. 5,807,000 Total 11,646,000 As will "bo seen by his report there has beena stea'djj decrease of.salmon in tho Fraser river since 18S2. In 1835 the first fry from the hatchery was turned out amounting to 1,800,000 young fish. This being the fourth year thereafter is, consequently, tho first yeanthat they -could look for any results from the planting, and they have surely not looked in vain, a3 they have .put up the largest amount of fish this season that has ever been packed on the Fraser river since the beginning of the industry, 362,000 cases. This is-moreihan has been packed on the Columbia this year, although the, i Columbia , contains about 300 square miles of fishing groun'd and the I1 raser only about 00 square miles. With the-encouraging reports from the Fraser Biver hatchery, and those given in our last report from the Bogue Biver hatchery we shall look forward with great interest to the sea son of 1891, when we may look for the return of the first fish planted by the state commission in 1887.
