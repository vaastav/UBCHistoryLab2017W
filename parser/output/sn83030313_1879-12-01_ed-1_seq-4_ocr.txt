"Tiie Only Cured a man lias is tbat which lio practises," said a preacher yesterday. No church will deny it, but what an army of hypocrites the rule discloses. On Saturday an affectionate father was oiliug a gnu while his little son played about him; of course the gun was supposed to be not loaded, or at leant ill sate bands, but the bov is dead. Tin: Kat.sk Report about the aims and instructions of the Catholic Archbishop Williams is still giving some Protestant clergymen the opportunity for making themselves laughed at, even by members of their own congregations. Visitors and Whiskey have their proper places in the general economy, but a railway signal station is not one of them, so Justice Wanilcll's commitment of a jolly trackman and telegruph operator yesterday will be generally approved. The Bitter Merchants are greatly exercised over the increasing sales of oleomargarine and propose to prosecute the offenders. 11" they were first to refuse to sell had butter they might accomplish the desired purpose without any expense whatever. Mil. Talmagk assumes that the power that kept the lions from hurting Daniel will save the virtuous young man from the "bears" in Wall street; but where would the preacher have got his simile had Daniel gone ol his own will into that Persian menagerie and played "bull ?" Skates have been introduced in the Norwegian army with good results. Perhaps our own War Department mav take the hint and nrovide some of our Western posts with snowshoes.

Ont Special Despatch from Mai.kid brings us accounts of the doings at the Spanish capital yesterday. The scene in the Throne Room of the Palaiw was oih> of gorgeous brilliancy. The hull fights and other popular ffttes Imve yet to take place iu order to complete the Madtilcno'a joy. Tiik Fact that a would-hc philanthropist must always sutler at the hands of the very class that lie desires to benefit was thoughtfully treated by Dr. Armitage yesterday.

YOKE Frrnldrnl Annual Ncu?k?. The President's Message, like Secretary Sherman's report, has been surreptitiously obtained and prematurely published, greatly to the annoyance, no doubt, of their respective authors. Tbe President must feel this breach of trust more keenly than the Secretary, since it will make an empty show of a usual mark of respect for the Chief Magistrate of the country. Unlike the department reports, the annual Message ! of the President is formally read at length in both houses of Congress, and listened to not only with the appearance but the reality of attention. Its contents being previously unknown, the members ??re curious to seo what the President has to communicate. But this year everybody will liave road the Message before delivery, and it will be a solemn bore to sit for two hours under the iiiflic* tion of a document with whose oontents they are perfectly acquainted. To ilispenso with the reading would be a violation of usage and of decorum toward the President, while to procoed with it before listless and uulisteniug auditors will be an idle and tedious formality unwelcome to all concerned. It would be still more annoying if the practice of the first two Presidents had been kept up ot delivering the annual communication in person to the two houses assembled in one chamber. It is easy to imagine how the pomp of sucli an occasion would be turned into ridicule, and what a loss of dignity would be felt by the President in delivering a ceremonious speech which had been deprived of its freshness and gloss and had satiated public curiosity. We suppose the publication might be punished as a contempt of Congress in intercepting and divulging a communication intended >for it, but this would be unwise, as magnifying tho want of skill and care on the part of the Executive. The Message thus surreptitiously obtained is a plain and unambitious document, which conveys in a clear, straightforward manner the views of the President on the present state of the country. It has a higher merit than force of diction and intellectual astuteness?the great merit of steady and honest adherence to sound principles without vacillation or trimming, or any of the shiftiness which bends to a lalso expediency. We have some abler men in public life than President Hayes, but none who excels him in that rectitude of understanding which proceeds rather from the moral than tho intellectual side of human nature, and which is the chief safeguard against ingenious and plausible error. Public questions are not so difficult that it requires any great stretch of iaoulties to understand them; otherwise republican institutions would be an absurdity. Government by the people implies that the people are capable of forming correct judgments on publio questions, and what is needed in their rulers is not so much superior intellect as steadfast virtue and political courage. To President Hayes belongs the praise of standing by his conviotions, which is the greatest merit that oan be possessed by a man who is clothed with responsible trusts. The leading recommendations in this Message bear the stamp of unswerving honesty of purpose in adhering to settled views. The large portion devoted to civil service reform exemplifies the President's tenacity in what he believes to be right. He returns to the charge with unabated zeal and courage. His position on this subject ia so obviously right and wise that he can afford to disregard the obloquy of trading politicians and keep alive the efforts which, if they do not sueceed in his time, must ultimately suacoed if wo are to save our free institutions. We cannot follow this part of the Message in detail, because the President touches another greut subjeot of more immediate urgency on which it is the duty of the press and the country to give him their promptest and heartiest moral support. Civil service can wait, especially while the head of the government is trying to check its most flagrant abuses ; but our great experiment at resumption is in such peril from gross imperfections in the laws as to justify notes of alarm even in the flush of apparent prosperity. The country stands on the downward road toward a new inflation, and progress in that direction must be arrested. The law requiring the continued coinage of base silver dollars must be repealed or our currency will sink to a lower value than it hud during the lour years which preceded resumption. There ha9 not been a day sinco the passage of the Resumption act in 1875 when the silver dollar was worth as much as the greenback dollar, and if the present large coinage of silver is to be continued gold will be driven out and our currency sink to the bullion value of silver, thus losing more than we have gained by resumption. On this point the President is explicit. "The market value of the silver dollar," he says, "being uniformly and largely loss than the market value of the gold dollar, it iB obviously impracticable to muintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value." When our currency sinks to that point it will be more depreciated than it wns at the date of the Resumption act, and this great and costly experiment of resumption will prove a failure and a farce. As if this danger were not sufficient, wo are threatened with another, whioh approaches with swifter steps. Our resumption is not redemption. What it builds up with one hand it immediately pulls down with tho other. By an absurd and stultifying lnw all the greenbacks whioh are taken outof circulation by resumption uro required to be put back into circulation by the Treasury. Il the currency becomes ever so swollen and inflated there are no legal means of reducing its volume, but a legal compulsion to keep it all in circulation. Genuine redemption of tho greenbacks would be the payment of a debt, but the pretended payment is a sham when another debt of equal ainouut is forthwith incurred. It is like the expedient ^called "skinning," by which a hard L
