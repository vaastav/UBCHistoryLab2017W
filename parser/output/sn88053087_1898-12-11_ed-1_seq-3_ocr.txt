It is not an ex aggeration to say tlmt the entire civilized world has been startled by the introduc tion of Greater America into the arena of European politics, as indicated by the , l|lperlall8t ic policy of the United States in the matter of colonial absorption and : expansion in the two hemispheres, i W mt Am ® rlca raay , P ,a 7. m . f I great military dramas of the future is a question interesting alike to the million i "ire who clips off the coupons from his [ bonds and the laborer who earns his hv-i : ln K by t.ie sweat of his brow; but that, it will be picturesquely interesting none will dispute. , British Secretary of State Chamberlain in a speech yesterday discussed the Government 8 policy in Egypt, which, he said, depended entirely upon the poB sibilitv of reaching an understanding with France, "a tiling which is nnpos sible so long as the French pursue a policy of exasperation." With regard to the relations between Great Britain and Russia in connection with the Far East, he said that, while hitherto the endeavors to reach an agree -1 ment liad failed, lie believed an agree ment with Russia was certain, unless serious complications were encountered, , "lam more sanguine of arriving at a settlement," said Mr. Chamberlain, "be cause it is not for our interests alone.

Wn iqcldoo, "' gHa,dmn8 ° f P | dooi. # * * No more critical period in history could have been selected for our advent into the Old World as a factor among the Great Powers than the present. All the great nations are equipped for war; the issues between some of them are grow ing daily more acute and if the signs of the times may be taken as foreshadowing coming events, even the skilled chplo macy of Lord Salisbury and other Euro pean statesmen will not prevent the fir mg of a spark that may set all hurope ablaze. Such a result would prove an international calamity, and frenzied jingoes would be the only ones that would not regard as the world s bene factors the man or men who can prevent tlie outbreak of hostilities, the outcome of which no one can foretell. I P i There is intense irritation in England over McKinley's plain announcement that the United States must build and control tlie Nicaraguan Canal across tlie South American Continent, in the con trol of which Britain wants to share. All tlie honeyed phrases which can be invented cannot Hide Jie fact that in 1882 both Blaine and Freliiigliuysen for mally announced to tlie British that the American Government regarded tlie Clayton-Bulwer treaty as null and ex tinct. Efforts are being made to repress any expression of passion or temper lest the Anglo-American movement may be endangered and Britain may lose Amer ica as an alley in fighting Russia in Asia, but it is not altogether a success. Tlie Dreyfus scandal continues to agi tate Paris, and tlie Court of Cassation lias ordered a stay in tlie trial of Colonel Picquart, the friend of the exile. Til's appears on its face to be a set back to the enemies of Dreyfus, but, as tlie mys terious methods of French courts are past finding out, it may practically mean nothing. * First of special importance, of course, in connection with out future develop ment as one of the great consulting na tions of the earth, is the policy of our probable ally—Great Britain whose present and prospective complications we may have to reckon with as our own. So many episodes have occurred during the week, in which England is vitally concerned, ns to be almost bewildering. Probably tlie most, momentous was tlie incident at tlie Britisli Chamber of Com merce dinner in Paris, during which the English Ambassador to France, Lord Frederick Monson, publicly insulted the French Government and warned it not to attempt to interfere witli England's policy in Africa. The slap in tlie face was all the more direct for its deliberate ness, Lord Monson having read his speech from manuscript which had evi dently had the approval of the British Cabinet. Already it lias roused intense feeling in Franco and tlie cable tells us that the French Ambassador at London will ask Lord Salisbury for an explana tion or an apology—which lie probably won't get. Tlius the crisis advances! * * * In making war on France, if such should result from the present strained relations, England may have to reckon not only with Russia,but with tlie Triple Alliance—Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany. Strange as it would be for Germany, the hated enemy of France, to be found on the tide of the French Re E ublic yet even more remarkable tilings ave occurred in European politics. Now in the event of such a vast combi nation of forces arrayed against her, and with serious results disturbing her In dian Empire, who has England to look # to for allies? Plainly her only ' the United States, and, remotely though it may be, the Japanese Kingdom. In a such of this magnitude, with modern methods of fighting employed, the great est conflict the world has ever seen would be witnessed. hope The gravity of the dangers to Great Britain are growing so rapidly and as Sliming such formidable shape that the i sentinmental gush of her public speakers SS&tJSjSS Sr£2rJ5 «, plainer language in wbich she tells us what sue expects us to do That con servative and able journal, the Saturday Review, of London, teais away the mask and speaks out plainly its significant ut terances, as the cable tells us "voicing the expectations of the average English man -" T,lere is no mjstakine the lan guage of the Renew which IS very candid in describing "the slobbering cant and hypocritical blazoning of doubtful affec t j on > > between the United States and Great Britain, and the writer goes on to pa . "Let ns be frank, and sav outright that we expect mutual gain in material inter ests from tlle rapprochement.

How often must we be told this in order to' make 11 s realize its truth? And yet there are some people who actually believe we saved ourselves and can do it again if necessary! * * As to tlie present attitude of Europe towards us, as the result of our Colonial expansion policy, Mr. Stead remarks with truth and force: "You may argue, protest and rage as you please, the Old World has made up its mind on the subject, and nothing that can be said or done in the United States will alter its judgment. Tho American Government has come out of its ring fence. It lias thrown its hat'into the arena of the world. It is launched on a career of conquest, which will be all the more predatory because it is masked by humanitarianism. * ' The answer to the question what does tlie Old World think of the New World lias never been made with greater emphasis than in tlie Eternal City. The oldest old world regards the newest new with feelings of atiger, disgust and alarm almost too great for words. The senti ment of indignation differs in intensity. But it is universal. "There is no sympathy for tlie United States either among whites or blacks—in fact, dislike of the American seizure of the Philippines and a conviction that tlie humane enthusiasm which made tlie war possible was a mere mask of cant assuag'd in order to facilitate conquest are almost the only sentiments shared in common by tlie rival camps of theQuiri nal and of tlie Yaticau. * * * " 'It is all very well,' they say in effect, 'to dissemble your love, but why did you kick me downstairs. It was ail very well to proclaim your disinterested ness, but wliy should you seize tlie Philippines.'"' * # * Tlius it will be seen that Greater America's entrance, or trance into tlie arena o already proven to be an agitator of no small importance. Whether we shall eventually get value received for our im perialistic policy is a problem to be solved in the future. * * * As showing how easy it is for us to be come involved in Ola World complies tions it may be mentioned that a grave issue bas arisen at Peking, China. In volving France, England, Japan, Chi prospective t Europe, en lias In and the United States. The French Am bassador recently applied to the Chinese Foreign Office for a reversion of the deci sion of the Viceroy of Nankin, refusing to grant an extension of the French settlement at Shanghai by conceding Po Tung, a suburb. The Foreign Office, however, instead of reversing the Viceroy's decision, con firmed it. Conger, the American Minister, co-op erated with tho British and Japanese Ambassadors in urging that the conces sion be not granted, Po Tung being chiefly occupied by American and Brit ish wharves and warehouses. The French are making this an oppor tunity to seize the arsenal and pagoda, which has a good anchorage near Foo chow, wbich they have iong hankered after. The presence of French war ships at Nankin is meant to coerce the Viceroy, who remains firm in refusing the coveted concessions. British and Japanese war ships have also gone to Nankin to assist in stiffening the Viceroy's resistance. is as the us ut to of One of the early and direct results of the imperialistic policy of the Adminis tration in pulling us to the front in Euro pean and Asiatic affairs is the necessity which the President finds for a stronger army and navy as indicated in his re cent message to Congress.

It is a fact that the Peace Treaty at Paris has been practically adopted by the Ameri can and Spanish Commissioners, but it has yet to run the gauntlet of the United States Senate. There is already decided opposition manifested to its ratification and some talk of amending it (which may be legal ly done) by striking out tho $ 20 , 000,000 appropriation. Again the House of Rep resentatives may refuse to vote the nec essary appropriation to make the finan cial feature of the message effective. Some of the members claim that the President lias exceeded his authority in offering to pay $20,000,000 to Spain, and some warm discussion is promised in both Houses before the subject is finally disposed of. * s Youthful Pair Weddell.
