The election is over, there has been a change in ' proscutors, Downey has vanished, and Curry's case seems again lost in the shuffle. When Joe Curry left Spokane his arm hung limp by his side, because of his wound. His wasted form told of the pain and torture he had suffered in the last seven months, and his shattered nerves were only quieted by liberal doses of a strong drug, the craving for which he had acquired while it was administered to him to ease the racking pain that tore at his very life strings. Joe Curry is gone, Lee owney is gone, there has been a change of prosecutors; possibly it is thought that the ends of justice have been attained.
