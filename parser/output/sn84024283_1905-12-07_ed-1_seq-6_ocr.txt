PRESIDENT'S iMUM. MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Makes Recommendations for What He Considers Important Legislation. RAILROAD RATES FIRST TOPIC Would Materially Increase the Powers of Interstate Com merce Commission. LIFF INSURANCE QUESTION dees :ood and Evil in Labor Unions Aa for Immediate Appropri ation.! for Panama Canal, and Promises Report of Board of En gineers and Recommendations I.rter Other Matters. WiUilngton, Dec. 5.-The annual mes sage cy President Roosevelt was read In both ho Jes of congress to-day. It is a doc ument ol some 24,000 words, and con tains recommendations for much important legislation. The subject of federal supervision of cor porations, and especially railroad corpora tions Is the first subject treated of by the president, and to it he gives the greatest amount of attention. After speaking of the general prosperity of the country, and the power of the corporations for good or evil In connection with the nation's prosperity, hft cavR! So long as the finances of the nation re kept upon an honest basis, no other question of internal economy with which the congress has the power to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper ndustrlal conditions under which the indlviduals and especially the great corporations doing an Interstate business are to act. The makers of our national constitution provided especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come with in the sphere of the general government. The arguments in favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to-day, in view of the enormous development of great h,ltins agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusive. ly that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state action. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction Is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by the national government. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer In fullest form such power upon the national government by a proper amendment of the constitution. It would obviously be unwise to endeavor to secure Buch an amendment until it Is certain that the result cannot be obtained under the constitution as it now Is. The laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, hue resulted more often in showing that the states have no power in the matter than - that the national government has power; so that there at present exists a very unfortunate condition of things, under which these great corporations do ing an Interstate business occupy the po sition of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the na tional government having effective con trol over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and care fully undertaken, but resolutely per severed in, to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action. This is only in form an Innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration: for from the earliest time such regulation of industrial activities has been recog nized in the action of the law-making bodies; and all that I propose Is to meet the changed conditions In such manner as will prevent the commonwealth abdi cating the power it has always possessed, not only in this country, but also In England before and since this country became a separate nation. Present Laws Inadequate. It has been a misfortune that the na tional laws on this subject have hitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative kind, and still more that they have In part sought to prohibit what could not be effectively prohibited, and have In part In their prohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be allowed. It is gen erally useless to try to prohibit all re straint on competition, whether this re straint be reasonable or unreasonable; and where it is not useless it Is gener ally hurtful. Events have shown that It Is not possible adequately to secure the enforcement of any law of this kind by Incessarl appeal to the courts Th. partment of Justice has for the last four year devoted more attention to the en forcement of the anti-trust legislation than to anything else. Much has been accomplished: particularly marked has been the moral effect of the but it Is increasingly evident that there will be a very Insufficient beneficial re sult In the way of economic change. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops an other device to accomplish the same pur- pose. What Is needed Is not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to restrict com petition, but such adequate supervision and regulation as will prevent any re' strictlon of competition from being to the detriment of the public as well as such supervision and regulation as will prevent other abuses In no way connected with restriction of competition. Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no means the only one, Is overcapitaliza tion generally Itself the result of dishon est promotion because of the myriad evils it brings In Its train; for such over capitalization often means an Inflation that Invites business panic; It always con ceals the true relation of the profit earned to the capital actually Invested, and It creates a burden of .Interest payments which Is a fertile cause of Improper re duction In or limitation of wages; It damages the small Investor, discourages thrift, and encourages gambling and speculation; while perhaps worst of all Is the trlcklness and dishonesty which It Implies for harm to morals Is worse than ny possible harm to material Interests, and the debauchery of politics and busl . ness by great dishonest corporations Is far worse than any actual material evil they do the public. Until the national government oDtains, in some manner which the wisdom of the congress may suggest, proper control over the big cor porations engaged in Interstate commerce that Is, over the great majority of the big corporations It will be Impossible to seal adequately witn these evils. Railroad Bate Regulation. I am well aware of the difficulties ot the legislation that I am suggest lng, and of the need of temperate and cautious action In securing It I should emphatically protest against improp erly radical or hasty action. The first thins to do Is to deal with the great , corporations engaged In the business of Interstate transportation. As I said 'in my message of December last, the la. mediate ar4 most pressing nosd. "ft far as legislation Is concerned. Is the enactment Into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the govern ment such supervision and regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country engaged in Interstate traffic as shall summarily and effec tively prevent the Imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must Include putting a complete stop to rebates In every sh&pe and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be ex ercised with moderation, caution and self-restraint; but It should exist, so that It can be effectively exercised when the need arises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affirmative should be given to some administrative body created by the congress. If given to the present interstate commerce commission or to a reorganized Interstate commerce commission, such commission should be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe In the government in terfering with private business more than is necessary. I do not believe In the governmsnt undertaking any work which can with propriety be left In private hands. But neither do I be lieve in the government flinching from overseeing any work when it becomes evident that abuses are sure to ob tain therein unless there is govern mental supervision. It Is not my prov ince to indicate the exact terms of the law which should be enacted; but I call the attention of the congress to certain existing conditions with which It is desirable to deal. In my Judg ment the most important provision which such law should contain Is that conferring upon some competent ad ministrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought berore it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad Is reasonable and Just, and If it is found to be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it snail noi oe lawful to go the maximum reason able rate, as it is commonly called this decision to go Into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such ense the commts slon would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum; and It would need only one or two Ruch decisions by the com mission to cure railroad companies of the nrnotlce of giving improper mini mum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or origi nated by the roads, upon complaint and after Investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from any cornnratinn wh eh falls to respect an order of the commission. I regard this nower tn establish a maximum rate, as being essential to any scheme of real reform In the matter of railway regulation. The first necessity Is to secure it: and unless it is granted to the commission there is little use In touching the subject at all. Rebates Really Blackmail. Illegal transactions often occur tin der the forms of law. It has often oc curred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after it has been bought an open re duction is made In the rate to take effect immediately, the arrangement resulting to the profit of the one ship per and the one railroad and to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not be forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so that nobody can fail to under stand that any kind of commission paid oh freight shipments, whether in this form or in the form of fictitious damages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or pay ment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to confer on the trnvprnmpnt the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are de- oralizing and are used as rebates. The best possible regulation of ratcR would, of course, he that regulation secured by nn honest agreement among the railroads themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for instance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any- one big shlppe.' or big railroad to dis criminate against or secure advan tages over some rival: anti sucn agree ment would make the railroads them selves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested In the government to put a stop to agreements to the detriment of the public should, in my judgment, be accompanied by power to permit, under specineu conuiuons ami careful supervision, agreements Clear ly In the interest of the puDiic. mil. n mv judgment, ino iieuenaiijr giving this further power is by no means as great as the necessity for giving the commission or administra tive body the other powers I have enumerate:! above; and It may wall be Inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power In the commission or administrative body until it al ready possesses and is exercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the powers I recommenu as in deed the vitally important power ih.i tn fl a given maximum raw which rate, after the lapse of a reason able time, goes into tun erecci. buu.ici:i to review by the courts. n nfivnte car lines, industrial roads refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the interstate commerce commission mme aim ar hotly so iar as races arm agreements practically affecting rates are concerned. The private car owners and the owners of industrial ranroaas are en titled to a fair and reasonable compensa tion on their Investment, but neither pri vate cars nor Industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing preferential rates. A rebate In Icing charges, or tn mileage, or in a divi sion of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a reuate in any other way. NO lower rate snoum Eppiy on goods Imported thai! actually obtains on domestic goods from the American seaboard to destination except in cases where water competition is the controll ing influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged in Interstate business should keep any books or mem oranda other than those reported pur- nnnt to law or regulation, ana tnese books or memoranda should be open to the Inspection of tne government, only in this way can violations or evasions of the law bo surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted into tne national Danas uy me oana ex aminers; a few first-class railroad ac countants. If they naa proper direction and proper authority to Inspect books and papers, could accomplish much In pre venting willful violations of the law. It would not be necessary for thern to ex amine Into the accounts of any railroad unless for good reasons they were direct ed to do so by the Interstate commerce commission. It Is greatly to be desired that some way might be found by which an agreement as to transportation with in a state Intended to operate as a fraud upon the federal Interstate commerce laws could be brought under the juris diction of the federal authorities. At present It occurs that large shipments of Interstate traffic are controlled by con cessions on purely state business, which of course amounts to an evasion of the law. The commission should have power to enforce fair treatment by the great trunk lines or lateral ana branch lines. Immediate Action Urged. , I urge upon the congress the need of providing for expeditious action by the Interstate commerce commission In all these matters. ' whether in regulatlns rates for transportation or for storing or for handling proierty or commodities In transit. The history of the cases liti gated under the present commerce act hows that Its efflctsjr bu been to a great degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the most formidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law. The question of transportation lies at the root of all Industrial success, and .the revolution in transportation which has taken place during; the last half century has been the most im portant factor in the growth of the new industrial conditions. Most em phatically 'we do not wish to see the man of great talents refused the re ward for his talents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized; but we do desire to see the system of railroad transportation bo handled that the strong man shall be given no advan tage over the weak man. We wish to Insure as fair treatment for' the small town as for the big city; for the small shipper as for the big shipper. In the old days the highway of commerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; it belonged to the public and the traffic along it was free. At present the railway Is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it is kept open to all on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it is a very difficult and complex thing to manage, and It Is far better that It should be managed by private indi viduals than by the government. But it can only be so managed on condi tion that Justice Is done the public. It is because, in my judgment, public ownership of railroads is highly un desirable and would probably In this country entail far-reaching disaster, that I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them in the Inter est of the public as will make It evi dent that there Is no need for public ownership. The opponents of govern ment regulation dwell upon the diffi culties to be encountered and the in tricate and Involved nature of the problem. Their contention Is true. It is a complicated and delicate prob lem, and all kinds of difficulties are sure to arise in connection with any plan of solution, while no plan will bring all the benefits hoped for by Its more optimistic adherents. More over, under any healthy plan, the ben efits will develop gradually and not rapidly. Finally, we must clearly un derstand that the public servants who are to do this peculiarly responsible and delicate work must themselves be of the highest type both as regards integrity and efficiency. They must be well paid, for otherwise able men cannot fn the long run be secured; and they must possess a lofty probity which will revolt as quickly at the thought of pandering to any gust of popular prejudice against rich men as at the thought of anything even re motely resembling subserviency to rich men. But while I fully admit the difficulties In the way, I do not for a moment admit that these difficulties warrant us In stopping in our effort to secure a wise and just system. They should have no other effect than to spur us on to the exercise of the resolution, the even-handed Justice, and the fertility of resource, which we like to think of as typically Amer ican, and which will In the end achieve good results In this as in other fields of activity. The task Is a great one and underlies the task of dealing with the whole industrial problem. But the fact that it Is a great problem does not warrant us in shrinking from the attempt to solve it. At present we face such utter lack of supervision, such freedom from the restraints of aw, that excellent men have often been literally forced into doing what they deplored because otherwise they were left at the mercy of unscrupu lous competitors. To rail at and as sail the men who have done as they best could under such conditions ac complishes little. What we need to do Is to develop an orderly system; and such a system can only come through the gradunlly increased exercise of the rl"M of offi'Mnt government control. The president asks for legislation com pelling railroads to Install block systems on their lines, and also calls the attention of congress to the excessive hours of labor of train service employes of the railroad companies are often subjected to. He rec ommends that a commission be appointed to study of employers' liability with the ob ject of the enactment of a law covering the subject and applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal power. , The Labor Question. The labor question is treated of at con siderable length, and In this connection the president says: There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It Is true that some judges have misused this power; but this does not Justify a denial of the power any more than an improper exer cise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hear ing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must "depend upon the facts of the case; it should not be used as a pretext to permit violation of law, or the Jeopardizing of life or property. Of course this would not au thorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case In which it is not. already authorized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made in my last annual message for an In vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation In the several states. Such an investigation should take Into account the various problems with which the question of child labor Is connected. It Is true that these problems can be actu ally met In most cases only by the states themselves, but It would be well for the nation to endeavor to secure and pumisn comprehensive information as to the con ditions of the labor of children In the dif ferent states, so as to spur up those that are behindhand, and to secure approx lmately uniform legislation of a high character among the several states. In such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect Is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the nation depends upon the citizenship of the generations to come; the children of to-day are those who to-morrow will shape " the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neg lect them. The legislature of Colorado has recommended that the national gov ernment provide some general measure for the protection from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable con sideration. The department of commerce and laior should also make a thorough investiga tion of the conditions of women In in dustry. Over 6,000,000 American women are now engaged in gainful occupations; yet there is an almost complete dearth, of data upon which to base any trust worthy conclusions as regards a subject as Important as It is vast and compli cated. Thero is need of full knowledge on which to base action looking toward state and municipal legislation for the protection of working women. The In troduction of women Into industry is working change and disturbance in the domestic and i social life of the nation. The decrease In marriage, and especially In the birth rate, has been coincident with It. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must be made; but surely it can be made with less friction and less harmful effects on family life than Is now the case. This whole matter In reality forms one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time; It Is a social question of the first Importance, of far greater Im portance than any merely political or economic question can be; and to solve It we need ample data, gathered tn a sane and scientific spirit In the course of an exhaustive Investigation. In concluding with the subject of labor the president says; In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employe Interested, but also ' a third party the general public. Every considerable labor difficulty In which Interstate commerce Is Involved should be Investigated by the govern ment and the facts officially rsportc'. to 1 the public. Equal Rights for AIL The question ot securing a healthy, self-respecting and mutually sympathetic attitude as between employer and em ploye, capitalist and wage worker Is a difficult one. All phases of the labor problem prove difficult when approached. But the underlyng principles, the root principles, in accordance with which he problem must be solved are entirely sim ple. We can get Justice and right dealing only if we put as of paramount impor tance the principle of treating a man on his worth as a man rather than with reference to his social position, his occu pation, or the class to which he belongs. There are selfish and brutal men In all ranks of life. If they are capitalists their selfishness and brutality may take the form of hard Indifference to suffer ing, greedy disregard of every moral re straint which Interferes with the accum ulation of wealth, and cold-blooded ex ploitation of the weak; or. If they are laborers, the form ot laziness, of sullen envy of the more fortunate, and of will ingness to perform deeds of murderous violence. Such conduct Is Just as repre hensible In one case as In the other, and all honest and farseelng men should Join In warring against it wherever It be comes manifest. Individual capitalist and Individual wage worker, corporation and union, are alike entitled to the protec tion of the law, and must alike obey the law. The Insurance Scandal. On the subject of life Insurance the presi dent says recent events have emphasized the importance of early action looking to a solution of the subject of some sort of con trol that will furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed, and In this connection he continues: There is need of a stricter and uni form regulation of the vast Insurance Interests of this country. The United States should in this respect follow the policy of orther nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial interests which are clearly na tional in character. My predecessors have repeatedly recognized that the foreign business of these companies is an important part of our foreign com mercial relations. During the admin istrations of Presidents Cleveland, Harrison and McKlnley the state de partment exercised its Influence, through diplomatic channels, to .pre vent unjust discrimination by foreign countries against American Insurance companies. These negotiations Illus trated the propriety of the congress recognizing the national character of insurance, for in the absence of fed eral legislation the state department could only give expression to the wishes of the authorities of the several states, whose policy was ineffective through want of uniformity. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress should also con slder whether the federal government has any power or owes any duty with respect to domestic transactions in In surance of an Interstate character. That state supervision has proved in adequate is generally conceded. The burden upon Insurance companies, and therefore their policy holders, of con dieting regulations of many states, Is unquestioned, while but little effective check is imposed upon any able and unscrupulous man who desires to ex ploit the company In his own interest at the expense of the policy holders and of the public. The Inability of state to regulate effectively insurance corporations created under the laws of other states and transacting the larger part of their business elsewhere is also clear. As a remedy for this evil of conflicting, ineffective, and yet bur densome regulations there has been for many years a widespread demand for federal supervision. The congress has already recognized that interstate insurance may be a proper subject for federal legislation, for In creating the bureau of corporations it authorized it to publish and supply useful in formation concerning interstate cor porations, "Including corporations en gaged In Insurance. It is obvious that if the compilation of statistics be the limit of the federal power, it is wholly ineffective to regulate this form of commercial intercourse be tween the states, and as the insurance business has outgrown In magnitude the possibility of adequate state su pervision, the congress should care fully consider whether further legisla tion can be had. What is said above applies with equal force to fraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for life insurance. Under the subject of national revenues the president makes a plea for the enact ment of reciprocal arrangements between this and other countries, but does not ask for any tariff legislation at the present time. In the same connection he asks for economy In appropriations. Business Methods in Departments, On the subject of "graft" In the several government departments that have been under investigation he says: At various times I have Instituted Investigations into the organization and conduct of the business of the ex ecutlve departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclu sions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the general lmpres sion that the organization of the de partments is often faulty in principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are antl quated and Inefficient. There is every reason why our executive govern mental machinery should be at least as well planned, economical and efficient as the best machinery of the great business organizations, which at present is not the case. To make it so is a task of complex detail and es sentlally executive In its nature; prob ably no legislative body, no matter how wise and able,' could undertake it with reasonable prospect of success. I recommend that the congress con slder this subject with a view to pro vide by legislation for the transfer, distribution, consolidation and assign ment of duties and executive organiza tlons or parts of organizations, and for the changes In business methods, within or between the several depart ments, that will best promote the economy, efficiency and high character of tha government work. Federal Elections. On the subject of federal elections he rec ommends that it be made unlawful for po litical parties to receive campaign con tributlons from the corporations, and also that it be made unlawful for corporations to give such contributions, and in this con nection he says: Contributions by corporations to any purpose should be forbidden by law directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such pur poses; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as It went, an effective met nod ot stopping tn evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the na tlonal and the several state leglsla tures forbid any officer of a corpora tion from using the money of the cor poration In or about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money in connection with any legisla tion save by the employment of coun sel In public manner for distinctly le gal services. The Haguo Conference. The Hague conference and the -sub ject of arbitration generally Is treated of at considerable length, and In this connection an explanation Is given of this government's connection with the coming conference In the following words: The first conference of nations held at The Hague In 1899, being unable to dls nose of all the business before It, recom mended the consideration and settlement of a number of Important questions by another conference to oe called subse quently and at an early date. These questions were the following: (l) The rights and duties of neutrals; (2) the limitation' of the armed forces on land and sea, and of military budgets; (3) the use of new types and. calibers of military and naval guns; (4) the Inviolability of private property at sea In times of war: (6) the bombardment of ports, cities and villages by naval forces. In October, 1904, at the Instance of the Interparlia mentary unloi . - which, at a conference held In the Urited States and attended by the lawmaker of II Alffervnt nations. bad reiterated the demand for a second conference of nations, I Issued invitation to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention to send delegates to such a cqnference and suggested that it be again held at The Hague. In its note of De cember It, 1904, the United States govern ment communicated to the representa tives of foreign governments Its belief that the conference could be best ar ranged under the provisions of the pres ent Hague treaty. From all the powers acceptance was re ceived, coupled In some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging between Rus sia and Japan. The emperor of Russia, immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war. note presented to thepresident on September 13, through Ambassador Rosen, took the initiative In recommending that the conference be now called. The United States government in response expressed cordial acquiescence and stated that would, as a matter of course, take part In tne new conference and endeavor to further its aims. We assume that all civilized governments will support the movement, and that the conference is now an assured fact. This government will do everything in Its power to secure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made the cause of International peace, Jus tice and good will. In the conclusion of this subject he says: I have dwelt much on the dangers to be avoided by steering clear of any mere foolish sentimentality because my wish for peace is so genuine and earnest; because I have a real and great desire that this second Hague conference may mark a long stride forward In the direction of securing the peace of justice throughout the world. No object is better worthy the attention of enlightened statesmanship than the establishment of a surer method than now exists of securing justice as between nations, both for the protection of the little nations and for the prevention of war between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only to avert bloodshed, but, above all, effectively to strengthen the forces of right. The Oolden Rule should be. and as the world grows In morality It will be, the guiding rule of conduct among nations as among individuals; though the Golden Rule must not be construed. In fantastic manner, as forbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty and free republic should ever deal with all other states, great or small, on a basis of high honor, respecting their rights as jealously as It safeguards its own. The Monroe Doctrine receives engthy consideration, as does also tho appeal of Santo Domingo for assist ance which the president believes It Is our duty to give. In treating of the subject of the army and navy the president favors change in the method of promotion. He would promote officers on merit Instead of by seniority, believing that this method would be conducive to bet ter efficiency than the one now In ogue. He also recommends an In crease In the coast artillery; the gar risoning of considerable bodies of troops at one place, and for an In crease and reorganization of the med ical service In both the army and navy. Naturalization Laws. Legislation In line with the recommenda tions of the naturalization commission ap pointed by the president last March Is asked for. These recommendations are given as follows: First. A federal bureau of naturaliza tion, to be established in the department of commerce and labor, to supervise the administration of the naturalization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accomplished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and pro cedure. Third. More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth. The preliminary declaration of intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least 90 days after tha filing of his petition. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens o be confined to United States district courts and to such state courts as have jurisdiction in civil actions in which the amount In controversy is unlimited; In cities of over 100,000 Inhabitants the United States district courts to have ex clusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Public Land Laws. Recommendations for changes in the pub lic land laws are made, and In this connec tion the president says: The creation of small irrigated farms under the reclamation act Is powerful offset to the tendency of cer tain other laws to foster or permit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of great Irrigation works has been proceeding rapidly and successfully, the lands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the prospect that the policy of national Irrigation will accomplish all that was expected of It Is bright. The act should be ex tended to Include the state of Texas. The reclamation act derives much of its value from the fact that It tends to secure the greatest possible num ber of homes on the land, and to ere ate communities of freeholders, In part by settlement on public land, in part by forcing the subdivision of large private holdings before they can get water from government Irrigation works. The law requires that no right to the use of water for land In private ownership shall be sold for a tract exceeding 160 acres to any one land owner. This provision has excited ac tive and powerful hostility, but the success of the law Itself depends on the wise and firm enforcement of it. We cannot afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on the public domain. The greater part of the remaining public lands cannot be irrigated. They are at present and will probably at ways be of greater, value for grazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazing homestead of 640 acres in Nebraska and to the pro posed extension of It to other states, It Is argued that a family cannot be supported on 160 acres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true; but neither can a family be supported on 640 acres of much of the land to which It Is proposed to apply the grazing homestead. To establish universally any Buch arbitrary limit would be un wise at the present time. It would probably result on the one hand in enlarging the holdings of some of the great land owners, and on the other In needless suffering and failure on the part of a very considerable pro portion of the bona fide settlers who give faith to the implied assurance of the government that such an area is sufficient. The best use of the public grazing lands requires the careful ex amination and classification of these lands In order to give each settler land enough to support his family and no more. While this work is being done, and until the lands are settled tho government should take control of the open range, under reasonable reg ulations suited to local needs, follow ing the general policy already in sue cessful operation on the forest re serves. It is probable that the present grazing value of the open public range Is scarcely more than half what it once was or what it might easily be again under careful regulation. . The Immigration Question. Several recommendations looking to changes in the present Immigration laws are made, and he suggests that United States government agents pass uoon immi grants before they leave their native shores for this country. He also recommends such changes In the laws as would not work a hardship on the educated Chinese coming Into or visiting this country, but without letting down the bars to the Chinese coolie labor, and in this connection he says: But in. the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chinese coolies, grave injustloe and wronir have been done by this nation to the people of unina, ano-tnereiore ultimately to this na tion ltsen. uninese students, business and professional men of all kinds not only merenrms, nut oaimers, aoctors, manufao turers, pn 'sors, traveieM and the llk should K encouraged to fi i here trA treated on precisely the same foetlng tfeal we treat students, buslnecs men. traveler! and the like of other nations. Our law! and treaties should be framed, nit so as te put these people Is the excepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, except Chinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or unskilled laborers. There would not be the least danger that any such pro vision would result in any relaxation or the law about laborers. These will, under all conditions, be kept out absolutely. But It will be more easy to see that both justice and courtesy are shown, as they ought to be shown, to other Chinese, if the law or treaty is framed as above suggested. Ex aminations should be completed at the port of departure from China. For this purpose there should be provided a more adequate consular service in China than we now have. The appropriations, both for the offices of the consuls and for the offlot forces In the consulates, shoa.4 be In creased! Adulteration of Foods. I recommend that a law be enacted to regulate interstate commerce In miB branded and adulterated foods, drinks and drugs. Such law would protect legitimate manufacture and commerce, and would tend to secure the health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic In foodstuffs which have been debased or adulterated so as to Injure health or to deceive purchasers should be forbidden. Insular-Possessions. He treats at considerable length of condi tions In the Philippines, and recommends that the coastwise laws of the United states as applied to the archipelago be sus pended until July 1, 1909. He recommends the immediate fortification of Hawaii In order to conserve the interests of this coun try in the Pacific. He also advocates the adoption of legislation that will explicitly confer American citizenship on the people oi forto Kico, and on the general subject oi insular affairs says: I wish alto to call the attention of the congress to one question which affects our Insular possessions generally; namely, the neea oi an increased liberality In the treat ment of the whole franchise question Is these islands. In the proper desire to pre vent tne islands being exploited by specula tors and to have them develop In the Inter. est of their own people an error has been made In refusing to grant sufficiently lib eral terms to Induce the Investment of American capital in the Philippines and In Porto Rico. Elsewhere in this message 1 have, spoken strongly against the jealousy of mere wealth, and especially of cor porate wealth as such. But it Is particular ly regrettable to allow any such jealousy to be developed when we are dealing either with our Insular or with foreign affairs. The big corporation has achieved Its pres ent position in the business world simply because It Is the most effective Instrument In business competition. In foreign affairs we cannot aff ord to put our people at a dis advantage with their competitors by in any way discriminating against the efficiency of our business organizations. In the sams way we cannot afford to allow our Insular possessions to lag behind In Industrial de velopment from any twisted jealousy of business success. It Is, of course, a mere truism to say that the business Interests of the islands will only be developed If It be come the financial Interest of somebody to develop them. Yet this development Is one of the things most earnestly to be wished for in the interest of the islands themselves. We have been paying all possible heed to the political and educational Interests ol the Islands, but. Important though these ob jects are, It Is not less important that w should favor their Industrial development. The government can in certain ways heljj this directly, as by building good roads; but the fundamental and vital help musl be given through the development of the Industries of the Islands, and a most effi cient means to this end is to encourage big American corporations to start industriei in them and this means to make It advan tageous for them to do so. To limit the ownership of mining claims as has been done In tho Philippines is absurd. In treating of Alaska he asks that that territory be granted an elective delegate to congress, and of the territories of Okla homa, Indian territory, New Mexico and Arizona he says: Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indian territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. There Is no obligation upoe us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters of convenience only, as bind ing us on tne question of admission to state hood. Nothing has taken up more time In the congress during the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four territories above mentioned, and after careful consideration of all that has been developed In the dis cussions of the question I recommend that they be Immediately admitted as two states. There is no justification for furthei delay; and the advisability of making th four territories Into two states has been clearly established. In some of the territories the legislative assemblies issue licenses for gambling. The congress should by law forbid this practice, the harmful results of which an obvious at a glance. The Panama Canal. He refers to the Panama canal, but aside from asking for an immediate appropria tion does not give any recommendations as to other legislation at this time, but prom ises a later communication which shall cos tain the report of the board of engineer and his own conclusions as to the type v canal. On this subject he says: The American people Is pledged to tnA speediest possible construction of a canai adequate to meet the demands which the commerce of the world will make upon It, and I appeal most earnestly to the con gress to aid in the fulfillment of the pledge. Gratifying progress haBbeen made during the past year and especially during the past four months. The greater part of the nec essary preliminary work has been done. Actual work of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till the Canal Zone was made a healthful place to live in and to work In. The Isthmus had to be sanitat ed first. This task has been bo thoroughly accomplished that yellow fever has been virtually extirpated from the Isthmus and general health conditions vastly Improved. The same methods which converted the Island of Cuba from a pest hole, which menaced the health of the world, Into a healthful place of abode, have been applied on the Isthmus with satisfactory results. There Is -no reason to doubt that when the plans for water supply, paving and sewer age of Panama and Colon and the largo labor camps have been fully carried out, the Isthmus will be, for the tropics, an un usually healthy place of abode. The work Is so far advanced now that the health ot all those employed In canal work Is as well guarded ns it Is on similar work In this country and elsewhere. In addition to sanitating the Isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provided tor employes and an adequate system of supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been created. Hos pitals have been established and equipped that are without superiors of their kind anywhere. The country has thus been made fit to work In, and provision has been made for the welfare and comfort of those who are to do the work. During the past year a large portion of the plant with which the work Is to be done has been or dered. It is confidently believed that by the middle of the approaching year a suffi cient proportion of this plant will have been Installed to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. What Is needed now and without delay Is an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission. The first appropriation of $10,000,000, out of the 1136,000,000 authorized by the Spooner act, was made three years ago. It is nearly exhausted. There is barely enough of it remaining to carry tl.( commission to the end of the year. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. To arrest prog ress for any length of time now; when mat ters are advancing so satisfactorily, would be deplorable. There will be no money with which to meet pay-roll obligations and none with which to meet bills coming due for materials and supplies; and there will be demoralization of the forces, here and on the Isthmus, now working so harmoniously and effectively, If there Is delay In grant lng an emergency appropriation. The message closes with a recommenda tion for more adequate provision for the work of the state department, and a read justment of the salary list n .tr 1'4jlor-i ". OflkATK.
