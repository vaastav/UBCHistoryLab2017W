NOMINATING PRESIDENT i Would Not Abolish Conventions of Parties, But Suggests Radical Changes in Make-up and Work—Pol icy Toward Mexico Made Clear. (By Associated Press.) Washington, Dec. 2.—President Wil son was greeted by deafening applause as he began reading before the joint session of Congress and packed gal leries his message to the new Con gress. Applause halted the reading when he spoke of strengthening the anti-trust law and favored a primary for nominating presidential candi dates. He began reading at 1.08 and finished at 1:35, after which the joint session was dissolved. Address of the President. Gentlemen of the Congress: In pursuance of my constitutional duty to "give to the Congress infor mation of the state of the Union," 1 take the liberty of addressing you on several matters which ought, as It seems to me, particularly to engage the attention of your honorable bod ies, as of all who study the welfare and progress of the Nation. I shall ask your Indulgence if I venture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the tjany mat ters which have engaged the atten tion and called for the action of the several departments of the Govern ment or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suf fer in the abbreviation to which I should have to subject it. submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your com mittees and of all Members of the Congress who may have the leisure to study them, tance, as constituting the very sub stance of the business of the Govern ment makes comment and emphasis on my part unnecessary. At Peace With the Wbrld. a I shall i Their obvious impor The country, I am thankful to say, Is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of Interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the na tions manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes Of frankness and fair concession. So 1 far the United States has stood at the I front of such negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently be lieve, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of internation al friendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting renew al by the Senate. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the De partment of State to gain the assent, in principle, of no less than 31 na tions, representing four-fifths of the population of the world, to the nego tlon of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of Interest or of policy arise which can not be resolved by the ordinary proc esses of diplomacy they shall be pub y analyzed, discussed, and report upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation deter mines its course of action. There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the United States and other nations, and that Is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor . afid our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligations and the Interpretation of (Continued on Page Eight.) ♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦ ♦

When one reinemoers, says an ex change, that in an ordinary column there are 10,000 pieces of type, that there are seven wrong positions each letter may be put In and there are 70,000 chances to make errors, be sides millions of chances for transposi tions, he will not be too critical. In the sentence, "To be or not to be," by transposition alone it Is possible to make 2,759,022 errors. So you see the perils that beset a printer.

GENERAL BRINKLEY SUPT. PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MERIDIAN MAN APPOINTED TO SECOND BEST P08ITI0N IN PRINTING OFFICE. ing Dr. BOTH SENATORS FOR HIM _ Congressman Sisson Only Member of Congress From Mississippi Not On Hand for Opening of Regular Ses sion—Speech Was a Big Joke. (By Frank D. Lander, Jr.) Washington, Dec. 2.—The biggest job In the government printing office, next to the position of public printer, has gone to a Misslssippian. It is the position of superintendent of public documents and the appointee is Gen eral Joshua H. Brinkley, for many years a resident of Meridian and a thoroughbred Misslssippian. The appointment was based on merit, but It shows that when Missis sippi's senators agree on a man that i man has a good chance to land a ! plum. Both Williams and Vardanian, as well as the entire delegation in the lower house, recommended General Brinkley, and he was appointed over several score of other aspirants. In a number of occasions heads of prominent departments In the Wilson administration have shown they are willing to regard Mississippi for her long and fruitless stand for Democracy, but in most cases it has been impos sible because if a man is endorsed by either senator, the other usually ob jects and Mississlpplans are thereby deprived of their Just rewards. General Brinkley has been In the government printing office for many years and knows the workings of the ; | document division from first to last, Many a PP llcants were from states which hold part of the balance of po liticaI P° wer ln the country ' and Borae of General Brinkley's closest friends eared that he would not be appointed „ for this reason. But Public Printer _ . , . , Ford appointed him because he is best , , . . . . suited for the position and because he is one man on whom the two Missis sippi senators have not disagreed. Sisson Only Absentee. With the exception of Representa tive Thomas U. Sisson the entire Mis sissippi delegation is back for the opening of the first regular session of the first Democratic Congress In six teen years. Representatives Collier and Witherspoon arrived Sunday, fill ing out the entire Mississippi represen tation except Mr. Sisson. Not only Misslssippians, but rep resentatives from other states regard Mr. Sisson's speech criticising his col leagues for being absent as one of the biggest Jokes of season. Washing tonians are used to demagogy of a cer tain kind, but for a man to make a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives criticising a certain action of three-forths of his colleagues and then commit the same action him self in four days' time is something new even in this section and has fur nished several good laughs for groups collected in the lobbies and cloak rooms. The humor of the situation Is increased by the fact that Representa tive Sisson Is the last man in his dele gation to return. Williams Loses Hard Fight. Senator John Sharp Williams lost a hard fight before the senate Thursday when L. E. Plnkham was appointed Governor of Hawaii. President Wilson sent this nomination to the Senate on three separate occasions, and on as many occasions the senate refused to confirm It because of a fight against the Hawaiian which was led by Sena tor Williams. Senator Williams opposed the ap pointment of Plnkham, It is under stood, purely on the ground that he is a dyed-in-the-wool, stand-pat Republi can, and that the appointment of such a man to one of the most Important administrative positions ln the govern (Conttnueu on Page Five.) | L. de and no to the now of the main that the his ♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦♦•♦♦♦♦ THE

RATHER THAN STARVE FEHERALS QUIT CITY Conditions There Said to Make Life Unendurable—Water Supply Cut Off and Food Exhausted—Civilian« ara Walking to United States. (By Associated Prêts.) Juarez, Dec. 2.—"We will be shoot ing at the rampants of Mexico City within a month," said Gen. Villa to day. Hasty preparations are under way here to occupy Chihuahua City, reported vacated by the Fédérais. Villa says he will march to Mexico City. "The mob in Mexico City could oust Huerta in a day," he added. Rather than endure starvation, the Federal troops have evacuated Chihua hua City, according to advices receiv ed by General Francisco Villa, the rebel leader. The evacuation leaves the city open to possession by the rebels. The town was invested by rebel troops weeks ago. The reports received by Villa statea that Salvador Mercado, military gov ernor of the state, with 2,000 Federal troops, had left on foot for Ojinaga, On the United States border near Marfa, Tex.; that Generals Jose Ynes Salazar and Pascual Orozco, with more than 1,000 Fédérais, had retreated to the mountains west of the city, and that hundreds of civilians, including voa-fl en and children, who were on the verge! of starvation, had been started out to I walk to the United States border. 1 Besides being the capital of the I state Chihuahua, with a pouplatlon of 1 35,000, Is the second city of northern ■ Mexico. Neither in the Madero revo lution nor in the present uprising has Chihuahua been taken from the Féd érais.
