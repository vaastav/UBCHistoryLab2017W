EDITOIt. WEDMSDAT MORNING, DEC. 15, 18S0. The movement in favor of Lieut. Clovernor Cliftrlcs W. Btoue for United States Senator, is spreading liko a prairio fire. Every man in this section of the State recognizes in hint the qualities that constitute and make powerful tto true statesman. If our legislators care aught for the interests t)f our people they will see to it that Chas. W. Stone is tho successor to Senator Wallace. Then the oil pro ducers would feel that they had at least one powerful champion in Con gress. Bradford Ntws. Mk. Garfield, the President-elect, in response to un address from the Ohio Presidential Electors, who waited upon him in a body recently, called attention to a very significant fact that, in the entire history of the He public, not n man who had been chosen by the people ns an Elector has ever failed to fulfill the trust re posed in him, to vote for tho candidate designated as the mau of their choice. This is all the more significant, because 110 actual pledge is ever demanded of an Elector ; it is simply an obligation of honor. Harry Wuiru proposes to da what he cau for his District before leaving Congress. Last Monday ho introduc ed a bill into the House appropriating $61,000 to continue improvements on the Allegheny river from Fsttsburgh to French Creek ; $40,000 for work above French creek to Olean, N. Y., and $18,000 for Rod Bank from Brookville to Allegheny river. Tid ioule News. This doesn't look much as though Gen. White was securiug appropria tions for political purposes, and ought to be sufficient to stop the contempta il e frothings of his defamers on that score. , THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE!. Tho last Annual Message of Presi dent Hayes, which we give in supple mental form this week, is an extended and interesting document; and pre sents a flattering statement of the con dition and pospects of the country. The Message urges upon Congress tho duty of seeing "that every case of vio lation of the letter or spirit of the fif teenth amendment of the constitution is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party." The President urges the taking of measures for the suppression of polygamy. lie would have Congress provide for the government of Utah by a Governor and Judge appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and Would make all persons practicing or upholding polygamy ineligible to vote, sit on juries, or hold office in the Ter- ritory. He recommends the prosecu tion of Civil Service reform, includ ing competitive examinations and "a complete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments." Ho heartily approves tho new Indian policy which contem plates tho dissolution of tribunal rela tions, the allotment of laud to the In dians in severalty and their admiss ion to all the rights of citizenship. The condition of tho national finances is eminently satisfactory. Among the recommendations in this connection is one, that tho silver coinage law be changed to make tho silver dollar equal as bullion to the gold dollar. The right of the United States to maintain supervision over any inter- oceauic canal across the Isthmus of Panama is reasserted. No one should fail to read the Message. - 

HARRISBURG JOTTINGS. IIARRI3EURG, Pa.. Dec. 11. '80 The annual renovation ot tho Senate Chamber and nouso of Iiepresenta lives is now going on preparatory to the assembling of the two auu6t bodies of statesmen. No new dcvelopements iu the con test for the U. S. Senatorship have as yet accrued and Mr. Grow still re tains tho lead. It ia not probable though possible, that he will be elected as he is strongly anti-Uamerou. and to allow his ejection would show weak ness on tha part of Don ; therefore, if hi coinei forward with very great force a compromise candidate who will Le acceptable to both parties, when it is frhowii that Cirrnv tutioot succeed, will I. 

H.'WHXK, no doubt bo put forward. The Ifoyt men wont give their strength for Grow, no more than tho Gi'ow men will throw their force for Hoyt. The Grow men will undoubtedly ntick and hold their own and the backers of Uoyt (Grow'a leading competitor) find ing it impossible to wiu will take up either Lieut-Gov. Stone, or Col. Moore head, either of whom will band together all the opposition to Grow and also the scattering vote and make their electiou and Grow'a defeat sure. Next in interest to the above fight is tha contest for the Speakership of tho House of Representatives. Mr. Benjamin L. Hewitt, of Blair county, apparently has n, walk-over, no com petitor of any assured strength having as yet appeared. One of tha warmest fights for position is that for the Resi dent Clerkship, tho contestants for which aro Ex-Repreentative J. B. Agnew of your town, Mayor Patterson and Edward Allen of Harrisburg. Patterson is the present Mayor of this city. Allen is a confectiouer and was Reading Clerk of the House last sess ion. Tho former incumbert of the office was John A. Smull, the compiler of SmulPa Handbook, who was found dead in bed at the Girard House, in Philadelphia, about a year and a half ago. Win. Cooper succeeded him and served several months when he was relieved by Ex-Speaker Long, who appointed Wra. P. Smull. Agnew being so well known to your readers, having represented them iu the House for so long it is not necessary for me to speak of him at any length. He is well and favorably known throughout the State, and a mau who, understand ing the duties as he does, would fill the office acceptably. From the back lug which has been proffered him he will no doubt attain the position, the delegations of Philadelphia, the North and West being solid for him. We are likely to have a lively timo hero this winter, after the House gets in session, which will be on tho first Tuesday in Jauuary. Warren. o School Reports.
