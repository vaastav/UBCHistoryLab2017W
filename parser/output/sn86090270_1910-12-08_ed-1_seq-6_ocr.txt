tho leading subjects touched upon Jfo also re views tho work of tho various gov ornment departments and concurs In recommendation tending toward the bettering of the service made by sev eral of the members of hlB cabinet Economy Is Urged In dwellinff on the urgent nped for economy In government expenditures the president says Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30 1912 I say this In order that congress may understand that these estimates thus made present tho smallest sun which wltl maintain the departments bureaus and offices ef the government and meet Its other obligations under existing law and that n cut of these estimates would re sult In embarrassing the executive branch of tho government In the performance of Its duties This remark does not apply to tl e river and harbor estimates except to Those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under author ized contracts nor does It apply to the public building bill nor to the navy build ing program Of course as to thee con gress could withhold any part or all of tho estimates for thenf without Interfer ing with tho discharge of the ordinary ob ligations of these functions of Its depart ments bureaus and offices Against the estimates of expenditures 140 434 013 12 we have estimated receipts for next year 680 000 000 making a proba ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or dinary expenditures of about 50 000 000 or taking Into account tho estimates for the Panama canal which are 53 920 847 69 and which will ultimately be paid In bonds It will leave a deficit for the next year of about 7 000 000 If congress shall conclude to fortify the canal Wants Forest Limitation Removed On the subject of conservation he do votes considerable space to forest coal oil and gas phosphate lands and water power sites As to the reservation of forest lands he says The law now pro hibits tho reservation of any more forest lands In Oregon Washington Idaho Montana Colorado and Wyoming except by act of congress I am informed by the department of agriculture that the gov ernment owns other tracts of timber land In these states which should be Included In tho forest resones I recommend to congress that tho limitation herein Im posed be repealed Congress ought to trust the executive to use the power of reservation only with respect to lind most aluable for forest purp05s During the present administra tion n 250 000 acres of land largely non timbered hae been excluded from forest reserves and 3 COO 000 acres of land prin cipally valuable for forest purposes have been Included In forest reserves making a reduction In forest reserves of non timbered land amounting to 2 750000 acres Wants Canal Fortified Ttegardlng the Panama canal the presi dent asserts that unless unexpected ob stacles arise the waterway will be com pleted well within time limit of Janu nrv 1 1915 and within estimate of cost 175 000 000 Suggestions for levying of tolls and management are made nnd re garding fortification of the canal ho saysAmong Among questions arising far present solution Is the decision whether the canal Bhall be fortified I hate already stated to the congress that I strongly favor for tification and I now reiterate this opin ion and ask your consideration of the subject In the light of tho report already before you made by a competent board Failure to fortify tho canal would leave tho attainment of both these alms In tho position of rights and obligations which w should bo powerless to enforce and which could never In any way bo ab solutely safeguarded against a desperate and Irresponsible enemy Ship Subsidy The president urges such action as he believes will Increase American trade abroad and says Another Instrumenxllty Indispensable to the unhampered and natural develop ment of American commerce Is merchant marine All marttlmo and commercial na tions recognize the Importance of this factor The greatest commercial nations our competitors jealously foster their merchant marine Perhaps nowhere Is the need for rapid and direct mall pas senger and freight communication quite bo urgent as betwoen the United States and Latin America We can secure in no other qdarter of the world such Imme diate benefits In friendship and com merce as would flow from the establish ment of direct lines of communication with the countries of Latin America ade quate to meet the requirements of a rap Idly Increasing appreciation of the reci procal dependence of the countries of tho western hemisphere upon each others products sympathies and assistance I alluded to this most Important sub ject In my lost annual message It has often been before you and I need not re capitulate tho reasons for Its recommen dation Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only treat commercial no S tion unableSo avail In International mari time buiIneKvof this great contribution to the mcansiSorthe worlds commercial In tercourse M j > CItklim Of the Tariff In the Space devoted to the tariff th president says The schedules of the rates of duty in the Payne tariff act have been subjected to a sreafjdeal of criticism somo of It just more of It unfounded and too much misrepresentation The act was adopted In pursuance a declaration by the par ty which Is responsible for It that cus toms bll ehoutd be a tariff for the pro tection ofhome industries the measure of the protection to be the difference be tween > the cost of producing the Imported article abroad nnd the cost of producing It at homevtogcther with such addition to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to the home producer The basis for the criticism of this tariff is that in respect to anumber of the schedules th declared measure was not followed but a higher difference retained or Inserted by way of undue discrimination In favor of certain Industries and manufactures Lit tle If any of tho criticism of the tariff hflB been directed against the protective principle above stated but the main body of tho criticism has been based on the at tempt to conform to the measure of pro tection wasnot honestly and sincerely adhered to The president also refers to the appoint ment of a board ot experts to Investigate the cost of production of various articles Included Inthe schedules of the tariff and concludes Whether or not tho protective policy Is to be continued and the degree of protec tion to be nccorded to our home indus tries are questions which the people must decide through their chosen representa tives But whatever policy Is adopted It Is clear that tho necessary legislation should bo based on an impartial thor ough and continuous study of the facts Recommends Parcels Post The adoption of the parcels post Is again adopted On this subject President Taft says With respect to the parcels post I respectfully recommend Its adop tion on all rural delivers routes and that 11 pounds tho International llmttba mado the limit of carriage In such post The same argument Is made against tho parrels post that was made against the postal savings bank that It Is Introduc Jng tho government Into a business which should be conducted by private persons and la paternalism Tho postoflico depart ment has a great plant and a great or ganization reaching Into tho most remote hamlet of Lthe United States and with this machinery it Is able to do a great many things economically that If a new organization were necessary It would be Impossible to do without extravagant ex penditures v Department of Justice Discussing the affairs of the department of justice tho president says I invitoespecial attention to the prose cutions underathe federal law of the so called bucket shops and of those schemes to defnud In which the ubq of tho mall Is fan essential part of the fraudulent cnhsplracj prosecutions which have saved1 ignorant and weak members of the public jind are ealng them hun dreds of millions of dollars The viola tions of tho antitrust law present per haps the most important litigation before the department and the number of cases filed shows the activity of the govern ment in enforcing that statute In a special message last year I brought o the attention ot congress the propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen eral law providing for tho Incorporation of Industrial and other companies engaged In Interstate commerce and I renew my recommendation In that behalf The crying need in the United States of cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying judicial procedure and ex pediting final judgment Is pointed out and action looking to correction of these evils Is urged The president recommends an Increase In the salaries of federal judges Postal Affairs In regard to postal matters the presi dent points with pride to Its present effi cient management and the recent reduc tion in tho deficit The present unre stricted franking privilege comes In for comment with a suggestion for the adop tion of better methods for Its regulation Abolish Navy Yards The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by tho secretary of the navy which he recommends for adoption and continues The secretary of the navy has given personal examination to every navy jar nnJ has studied the uses of the navy yards with refeience to tho necessities of our fleet With a fleet considerably less than half the size of that of the British navy we have shipyards more than double tho number and there aro several of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern mchlnery which after Imestlgatlon the secretary of the na > y believes to be entirely useless for mval purposes He asks authority to abandon certain of them and to move their machinery to other places where It can be made of use Speaking of our foreign relations the president says During the past year the foreign relations of the United States have continued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding Tho year has been notable as witness ing the pacific settlement of two Impor tant international controversies before the permanent court of TheHague Tre arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Great Britain which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond ence since the fisheries convention ot 1818 has given an award which Is satisfactory to both parties This arbitration Is par ticularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently Just results secured but also because ItJs the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4 1903 between the United States and Great Britain and disposes of a con troversy the settlement of which has re sisted every other resource of diplomacy and which for nearly ninety years has been tho cause of friction between two countries whose common Interest lies In maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations with each other President Taft makes a few recommen dations for changes In the interstate com merce law and says Except as above J do not recommend an > amendment to the Interstate com merce law as It BtandSj I do not now recommend any amendment to the anti trust w In other words It seems to me that the existing legislation with reference to the regulation of corpora tions and tho restraint of their business has reached a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous exscutlon of the laws bf the statute books In restraining the abuses which ctrtalnly did exist and which rouied the public to demand reform V
