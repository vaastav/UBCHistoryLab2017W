MARY PICKFORD AND CARLYLE BLACKWELL, In a scene from "Such a Little Queen," by Channing Pollock, at the Olympic today.

Government clerks have too little time for lunch, says Dr. Wil liam Gerry Morgan. The thirty minutes officially allowed them, curtailed by the time taken in arranging their desks and reaching a lunch room does not permit of the proper mastication of their food, or give them time even to obtain the proper kind of food. He urges that the noon period be extended from thirty minutes to a full hour, and predicts that if this were accomplished, the results would show in increased efficiency and health among the clerks.

They base this belief on tho announcement by President Wilson, in his message yesterday, that the Ad ministration bUElness program is com plete. This was construed by them to mean that the bill giving the Interstate Com merce Commission lurisdiction over all night and WerCtfuture issues nf mllwm. .iKiirltlis otirt boldest sort of I u,, ,,. , '. . the anti-trust law have been permanent ly sidetracked. And because of this business Interests are expected to im mediately begin adjustment of their af fairs to the existing laws. All that remains for the completion of the President's business program Is the nomination and conflrmation of his Fed eral Trade Relations Commission of five members. This commission, it is under stood, will be selected by the end of next week. So far only one person is certain of appointment- That is Joseph Davies. of Wisconsin, now Commissioner of Corporations, whose oflice is abol ished when tho new commission Is cre ated. Tho present understanding is that the commission will comprise two lawyers of whom Davies is one two business men, one of whom shall have had ex perience in foreign trade, and one economist The President has let It he known that there will be no prelimin ary announcement of his selection. Ills experience with the publicity given the men he wanted to serve on the Federal Reserve Hoard has convinced him. h has told his friends, that it is best to say nothing about his selections until tne nsi is reany to send to thi Senate. It was stated at the White Hmise to day that numerous letters and telegrams oi congratulation on i,i announcement to business men have, already been re ceived hv the Pieslfleut from various sections of the country. t'ndt-r the ausphes or the Sons or Confederate Veterans a ball was given last evening at 133.'

Democrats of the House Rule Com mittee havo put the stamp of disap proval on the Gardner reso'ution for the appointment of a special investi gating commission to pass upon tho alleged unpreparedness of the army and navy. Taking the tip from the President's opposition to an inquiry at this time. Chairman Henry wrote Mr. Gardner last night, saying that the majority of the committer had con ferred "and denied It Inadvisable to grant hearingr." Congressman Gardner replied in a caustic letter, asserting that for the first time in history .1 ni-mber of Con gress nas Deen denied a hearing by a committee to which his resolution was referred. He also informs Mr. Henry that "you cannot dam tho dclcnse movement, as much as you may damn It-" Congressman Gardner takes excep tion to Mr. Henry's statement that be has consulted with a majority of the committee, and It has been dedded to refuse hearings. Mr. Gardner demands a meeting of the full Rules Committee, saying: "Vou, I know, are sufficiently fa miliar wivn tne rules ot tnc House to know you cannot take eueh a step without first calling a meeting of your committee. This ou have not done." Field Agents Take Up Crop Estimate Work A corps of field agents will take up the duties that were formerly performed by State statistical agents, according to the annual report of the Bureau of Crop Estimates. There are now 143,621 volunteer crop reporters and special correspondents as sisting the bureau. Their co-operation has enabled the salaried force of the Bureau to perform much more work than otherwise would have been possible. In this connection, the report contains some interesting statements in regard to the accuracy of the crop forecasts of th bureau, which were begun in 1911.

That means that what breakfast he has must be assimilated on the Jumo, if he wishes to set to office In time. Up to this rolnt, of course, it Is Pericles' fault that he has not had sufficient nourishment on which to begin work, but It does not alter the fact that he should have a good lunch Yet when the clock drags its hands cround to 12:30, marking the beginning of the noon lunch time, Pericles can not start from his desk and take ad vantage of the full time.

Great corporations find it a good business policy not only carefully to select intelligent, healthy men and women to serve them, but to safeguard the health of those people aa well, so as to obtain tho highest measure of ef ficiency and the longest term of service from them.

Allowing another five minutes for the return trip, Pericle3 finds that he has not more than fifteen minutes, and many times less, ln which to get and eat his lunch.

And between leisurely ministering ln a proper manner to the needs of his stomach with the alternative of facing a scowling chief of division. Pericles never errs on the side of his much abused stomach. Yet along about 3:30 in the afternoon, Pericles wonders vaguely why the pie and coifee and sandvvith seem to havt suddenly developed claws with which they arc tearing at his vitals, and ho feels that his stomach and his liver and a fev ntlmr Imnortant factors ln his con stitution have all conspired to make h m the most wretched of men.
