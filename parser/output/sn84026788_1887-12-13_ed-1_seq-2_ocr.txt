SPIRIT OF JEFFERSON. CKJlBUSTOWS, J*?F*R3GM COONTT, W. Vi. TDE8PAY MORNING. DECEMBER 13, 1887. The Senatorial contest is not yet decided. The Samuel J. Randall Club, of Pittsburg, Fa., has indorsed Presi dent Cleveland's message. Mr. Samuel Spencer was on Satur day elected President of the B. & O. R. R., at an anual salary of $25,000. Hon. John S. Barbour has been nominated by the caucus Democrats of the Virginia Legislature for United States Senator. ? ?? ? Both the House and Senate Demo cratic caucuses came to West Vir ginia for secretaries, and W. L. Wil son and J. E. Kenna filled the order. The United States Supreme Court has rendered decision in favor of the State of Virginia in the habeas cor pus cases and ordering the release of Attorney-General Ayres and the other petitioners. Capt. J. H. O'Bannon, of Rich mond, received the Democratic cau cus nomination for public printer of Virginia. Capt. OBannon is a native of Jefferson, and spent his earlier years in the " art preservative" upon the Spirit of Jefferson; Chicago has been selected as the place and the 19th of June as the time for the next National Republi can convention. Mr. Blaine's friends eontrolled the proceedings of the National Republican committee. It fs thought that his nomination for the presidency is assured, and that Cleveland and Blaine will again make the race in 1888. In assuming for the third time the duties of Speaker of the House, Mr. Carlisle said: "The time has come when a revision of our revenue laws and a reduction of taxation are absolutely necessary, and a moderate and reasonable reduction of duties will not imperil as large and impor tant interests as will the neglect of the obvious requirements of the fi nancial situation." A Washington telegram to the Wheeling Register says: Congress man Wilson says he indorses the President's tariff ideas in general.? ?'I am," he says, " in favor of tariff reduction, and am willing to include the abolition of the tobacco tax, if that is necessary to secure harmony, in any scheme to reduce the revenue to the actual needs of the Govern Blent. It is difficult to name exactly to what extent?say by ?65,000,000 or 875,000,000. Nearly 2,000 members of the Evan gelical Alliance called at the White House last Friday, and were individ ually presented to the President and Mrs. Cleveland. The Rev. Dr. Bur chard, of New York, of the "Three R.'s" fame, was among the visitors. The President recognized him at once, and, advancing towards him, said with considerable earnestness and fervor that he was very glad to see him, whereupon the crowd of delegates broke out into laughter. The President nominated Secreta ry Lamar for associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, Win. F. Vilas for Secretary of the Interior, Don. M. Dickinson for Postmaster General, Charles S. Fairchild for Sec retary of the Treasury, George L. Rives for Assistant Secretary of State, Isaac II. Maynard for Assis tant Secretary of the Treasury, Sig eumey Butler for second comptroller of the treasury, and Jas. W. Hyatt for treasurer of the United States. The selection of Chicago as the meeting place of the Republican presidential nominating convention does not placate the Chicago Tribune, the leading Republican paper of the Northwest. It still maintains that Mr. Cleveland's views on the tariff question are correct, and as for Mr. Blaine's views, it pronounces them Pennsylvania views, and, as such, without title to national acceptance. " Like all Pennsylvanians, Republi cans or Democrats," says the Tribune, " he believes in enormous duties on imports for the purpose of codding the mill bosses and protect ing the so-called infant industries.? He will find that Pennsylvania is but one State, and that outside its bor ders there is a large army who do not propose to be levied upon any longer for its benefit." Excursions to California. It is no longer necessary to organ ize large parties in order to secure cheap rates to Pacific Coast points.? The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company has placed on sale, at all its principal offices, Excursion Tick ets to San Francisco, Los Angelos and San Diego, California. These tickets are sold singly at lower rates than were formerly made for organ ized parties, and are good for six months from date of sale. Passen gers are offered a choice of routes both going and returning. For rates and detailed information call upon any of the Ticket Agents of the com pany, or address L. M. Cole, Gener al Ticket Agent, 13. & O. R. R., Bal timore, Md. The President's Message. The ? message addressed by the President to Congress yesterday dis cusses briefly and forcibly the one topic of tariff reform. livery other subject was excluded in order that Congress may be able to comprehend fully the absolute and pressing ne cessity of immediate consideration of " the state of the Union" as shown in the present condition of the treas ury. As a demonstration of the par amount importance of fiscal legisla tion directed to the end of extin guishing the growing surplus, through a reduction of tariff taxes, the message is unanswerable. On the 30th of June next the sum in the federal treasury over and above the needs of the government will be 6140,000,000. Hitherto the accu mulation of money has been to a great extent prevented by the re demption of matured bonds and the purchases required for the sinking fund, but in the future resource will be cut off by the fact that there are no more bonds subject to call, and the purchases of unmatured bonds authorized by law for the sinking fund will consume but a smatl frac tion of the estimated' surplus. It is not clear that the Secretary of the Treasury has authority to go into the market to buy bonds at a heavy premium beyond the requirements of the sinking fund, and if he had the authority, the exercise of it would be of a donbtful expediency. Ow ing to-a grave financial disturbance, caused in part by the accumulation of funds }Tt the treasury, SIS,877, 500 was expended in July last, im mediately upon the opening of the fiscal year, for bonds for the sinking fund, and this expenditure not hav ing relieved the distress at the money centres, S27,G8t,283 was shortly after expended for four and four and a-half per cent, bonds, the annual contribution to the sinking fund be ing thus completed. The govern ment was able to give some addition al relief by prepaying interest and by increasing the government's deposits in certain banks, but beyond this the government could not go, and the country is now face to face with a surplus which, under existing fiscal laws, must continue to increase, to the great risk of every important in terest in the country, the purchase of bonds at a premium being unau thorized by any general law. The immediate reduction of the govern ments income by suitable legislation is imperatively necessary. This re duction is to be effected, not by re moving the internal taxes on luxu ries, such us whiskey, beer and to bacco, but by reducing the tariff tax es on the necessaries of ltfe eoii^uuicU by the poor, and those also _.r - raw materials of manufactures, "eater good of the greater number will thus be consulted without injurj to the manufacturing capitalist or to the wage-earner. The present tariff bears hardly upon the poor, >ncre^ in" largely the price of every article they buy, and benefits but few per sons. The last census showed that there were 17,392,090 of our popuRa tion engaged in all kinds of mdus tries, 7,670,493 being engaged m a,, riculturc, 4,074.233 in professional and personal service, and ^'O.- b in trade and transportation, while the number engaged in ?ccl|P^'on* in which the foreigner can compete is but 2,023,089. To these the ap peal is always made to resist change, the idea being held out that a lower tariff rate means lower wages, lhw is delusive, as the history of this country under a tariff far lower than any nowadays practicable abundant ly shows. A lower tariff means wider markets, more constant employment, and better wages. Hut that the tar iff is unnecessarily high is shown Ij the fact that there are manufacturers who make money selling their wares under the prices the tariff ?t would enable them to command, anil that the steel trust, oil trust sugar trust, and various other trusts or '-poo's" of producers have been formed under protection of the tariff wall to keep prices up above the (i^ i,res at which, as facts show, ,t .. possible to sell with profit. The beneficiaries of the high tariff rates must not think that their interests are to lie ruined by a sudden, great or reckless reduction of rates, though the crv of free trade will no doubt be raised in their behalf in pro tectionist quarters. A\ ith all the re ductions that the fiscal siHiation cle mands, the tariff will remain high enough to afford all the ' protec tion" of which it is fairly capable.? But protectionist are in the same boat with other citizens, and they are as much interested as others to ward off the financial dangers to which the country is now exposed. If some small sacrifice of large profits s ne cessary to prevent panics, they should be the last to refuse, l'rogress to ward a wise conclusion will not be promoted by dwelling upon the theo ries of protection and free trade. That amounts only to bandying op - tliets. What confronts the country at present is an indisputable fact, not a theory. The question of free trade has nothing to do with the duty of Congress at the present time.? What Congress now owes to the peo ple is to reduce taxation to the amount necessary to cover the ex penses of an economical operation of the government and to restore to the business of the country the money held in the treasury through a per version of the government s powers. Both of the great political parties have repeatedly oonde.nned the pres ent condition of our fiscal la? =and promised their correction. Ihesc pledges can now be redeemed with safety to all our industries without danger of reducing the rewards of la bor, and to the great advantage of the whole people. These courageous recommendations the 1 resident makes from conviction, lhey are ai?o iu accordance with the tradi tional U-nets of his party, and should have the effect of rallying to his sup port during the present session every friend of the people who op poses trusts, pools and other combi nations of producers to enhance the price of commodities consumed by the whole people.?Bait.
