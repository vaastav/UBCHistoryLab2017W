[CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE.] lIISMHIS. however, seems :to me so clearly i useful and efficient that I venture to press it .' upon your earnest attention. It seems to be a in. evident that the -.: prevision > ot a rcular steam postal communication by aid from the Government has been the forerunner of the commercial preponderance of Great Britain on all these casts and se w, a greater shore of whose trade lathed— and intent of our people. It "is also manifest that the off oris of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this caimmeree will be successful in proportion with tin ir adoption if a regular steam postal communi. canon with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country -and will aid in their development. V Similar co-operation may be looked for ln due time from the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi cult to see how the lead iv this movement can be - expected , from private- interests'. In respect of foreign commerce, quite as much a* internal trad o, postal e-ommunic -lion seems a necessary matter, and 1 respectfully recommend to your prompt attention such j is', and efficient measure* as may conduce to the development of our foreign commercial ex changes and the building up of our carrying trade. In this connection I desire also to suggest the veiv great service which might be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific Ocean, were * transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Isl ,nds, and [ thence to Japan at the nor— and Australia at the south. The great Influ ence if such means of communication in these routes of navigation in developing and securing a due share of our Pacific Coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustration or enforcement. . It may be that snort an enterprise, useful acd in the end profitable, as it would prove to private investment, may teed to be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additional and not unim portant, although secondary, reason for fostering , and enlarging our navy may be found in the unquer tionable serice to the expansion of our commerce whirl, would lie render— by the frequent ciri;'i!a tiou of naval ships in the seas and port* of all quar ter, of the globe." Ships of proper construction and equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in case- of maritime war, might be made constant and live agents in time of peace in the advancement and protection of our fore'gn trade and the future discipline of young seamen, who would naltiral'y in some numbers mix with and improve the crews of onr merchant ships. Our merchant* at homo j and abroa ' recognize the value to foreign com mer.i- of the active movement of our naval ves sels, and the intelligence and patriotic zsnl of naval officers in promoting every interest of their coun trymen is a Just subject for national pride. FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. The condition of the financial affair* of the Gov ernment; as shown by the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury, are very satisfactory. It is be!i ved that the present financial situation of tbe United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never I be; surpassed by that of any country at any period in its history. All our industries are thriving; the rate of interest is low ; new railroads arc being con str—ted ; a vast immigration is increasing our pop- I ': ,-,, capital and labor; new enterprises in great number are in progress, and our commercial rela lions with other countries arc improving. The ordi nary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year en led June 1880 were .(cents being omitted) From customs, $180,522,064 ; from internal revenue, 813 4,9— ,378; i from . sale :of public lauds, $10,116,506; from ... tax . on . circulation and deposits of ~ national banks, $7,014,971 ; from the repayment of iaterest by the Pacific Roil way Companies, 81,707,367 ; from the sinking fund for the Pacific Railway Companies, $790,621 ; from customs fees, fines, penalties, etc., $1,148,800 ; from fees consular, letters patent and lands, $2,337,029 ; Iron, the proceeds |of the sales of " Government property, $282,616 ; from the profits of coinage, etc., $2,71— ; from revenues of the District of Colum bia, soil, Kil l; from miscellaneous sources, $1,099, ---603. Total ordinary receipts, $333,526 ,610. The •ordinary expenditures for the same period were : ' tot civil expense", $— ,— B,B__ for foreign inter course, $1,211,490 ; for Indians, $5,945,457 ; for pen sions (including . $19,311,0— arrears of . pensions), $5*1,777,174 ; for tho military establishment (including river and harbor im, rovemcuts and arsenals). 110,910 ; for the naval establishment (including vessels, in.tchinery aid improvements at navy yards), $13,536,951 ; f r miscellaneous expend itures (including public buildings, houses and col lecting the revenue), $34.53.'',— 1 ; for expenditures on account of the District if Columbia, $3,272,384 ; for Inter. on the public debt, 757,57.. ; for pre miums '■:. bonds purchased, $2,795,320. Total ordi nary expenditures, I*-— 12,9." 7 leaving a surplus revenue of $1.5,8— ,05.1, which, with the amount drawn from the cash balance- in 'he treasury of $8,184,484, making 873,988,(67. Ihe appropriation for the redemption of bonds for tho sinking fund was $73,652,900. Tho amount due the sinking fund ' for this year was $37,931,643. There was applied thereto the sum of $73,904,017, being $35,972,973 in excess of the actual requirements for the year. The aggregate of revenues from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $333,520,810— an increase over the preceding year of 90.9,421"- Tin receipts thus far of the current year, together with estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to $150,000,000, which will be euißcient to meet the estimated expend itures of the year and leave a surplus of $90,250,000. It is fortunate that this large sur ).l ii_ revenue occurs at a period , when it may be directly ,i; plied to the payment of the public debt, Boon redeemable. No V public . duty has been more e-oustantly cherished in the United States than tin policy of paying the nation's debt as rap idly as possible. The debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing in terest, i.'.taincd its maximum of $2,756,441,571 in August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced . to 11.881 , 519, 504. Of the principal of the debt, 810,875,810 has been paid since March 1, 1877, effect ing an - annual saving of - interest of $0,109, ."•'■::• The burd v of interest :' hoi also been di m'nisbed by , tho ;- sale . . of bonds drawing a low rate of interest, and the application of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual saving ilu. secured since- March 2, 1877, is $11,290,453. | With n a short period over $600,000,000 1 in five and six per cent. bonis, will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity, not ! only to farther re duce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which - will remain unpaid. I coll the attention of Congrcs to the views pro posed on this subject by the Secretory of tho Treas ury In his annual report, and ' recommend prompt legislation to enable tbe Treasury Department to complete the refunding of the debt which is about to mature. The' continuance of specie j payments : ho* n.i been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. : It has contributed greatly to the revival of business, and to our remarkable pros perity. V The fear* that preceded »nd accompanied resumption have proved groundless. No consider able amount of United States notes have been pre sented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domes and imported, are taken to the Mint and exchanged for coin or notes." Tbe increase of coin or bullion in* the United States I since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,339,423. There oie still in existence uncanceled $340,681,016 of United State* ";. legal tender > notes. These notes :■ were } r authorized . as % a . war . measure, mole necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The' preservation of the nation's existence required, in the Judgment of Congress, the issue of legal tender ooper money. 4 " That it served well the purpose for which i: was created is not questioned, but the em ployment of notes os paper money indefinitely after the accomplishment of the J object for ."which they -were provided was not contemplated by the trainers of the law under" which ■ they were issued. These notes long since x became',. like any: other primary -. gallon of the- Government, a debt to be paiil, \ and when paid to' be lancelod, a* a' mere evidence of indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore re - I— it v.:-.:it was said in" my message of last year, that I the retirement from circulation '; ef United States | j note-, with* capacity of legal tender to private con tracts Is a step ti be tab- to oar, progress towards a sife and stable currency, which should be accepted ; as th.> policy niid "duty of the ! Government and the interest and security "of the people. "f At the time , I "the passive of the Act now to force, requiring the coinage of : sUver diKars, fixing; their value and giving them a legal lender character, it was be lieved by many supporters of the measure that the silver doll- »l.i-b it authorized would speedily , become, under " the operations of ■' the ' law, of an I , - equivalent value to ! a . (Slid ; dollar. J There ; were ; j other supporters of the bill who, while they doubted , is to the probability of this result, nevertheless j i were willing to give the prop-cd experiment a f.-ir , i trill, with a view to step the C inagc if - experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by tbe" bill continu-d to be of I— l commercial value than the standard gold dollar. Toe coinage ct * - v-r dollar* under the Act "j referred ' to began in March, 1878, and has been continued as required by ; the Act. The average rate per month to this point of time has been $2,i7«,492. 1 The total amount coined prior to the Ist of November last was $72, ---817.150. Of this amount, $17,084,450 remain in the I— asm y, and only 8— ,7— .291 ' are in the bands of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circulation, and con i'eratlo expense necessarily undergone tor the purpose, but its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. : Con trary to the confident anticipations of friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar containing 412' grains of silver has not increased. .;. Daring the year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its coinage, the market value of the silver which it contains wai from 00 to 92 cent', as compare- with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average and market value of the silver dollar has been 881 cent*. 7 It is obvi ous that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was based on the anticipation of an increase in the value- of silver as a result of that legislation, lias failed to produce the effect predicted. ' Tiic longer - the y law remain* am force, : requiring, as it does, the coinage of a nominal dollar which :in : reality is r not " a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this countiy will be forced to accept the metal as the sole leal standard value in circulation, and thus a standard of less value than it purport* to be would be recognized in the money markets of the world. The Constitution of the United States, sound finan cial principles and our best interests, all require a currency which will serve as legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange, to the disparagement of imjiortant inter ests The United States produces more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one o! the two precious metal* which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute to this result if Congress ill repeal so much of the existing legis lation as requires the coinage of silver dollars of an equivalent with the gold dollar. This will defraud no man, and will be in accord with familiar pre c.'dents. Congress, on sovcra! occasions, ha* altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with .the actual ratio value between the two metals. ' In financial legislation, every measure "in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations his been found by experience to dimin ish the rates of interest which debtors are required to pay, and increase the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history . shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence in t''6*.xact performance of moneyed obligations is established. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The Secretary of War reports that the expendi lures of the War Department for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1880, was $39,924,773. The appropri ations for this Department for the current. fiscal year amounted to $41,993,-0. With respect to the army the Secretary invites attention to the fact that its strength is limited by statute (Section 115 of the Revised Statutes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that the provisos contained in the appro priation bills have limited the expenditure to an enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed that the full legal strength is the least possible force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While the enlistment of this force would add some what to the appropriation for the pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than equivalent for this additional outlay, rod the efficiency of the army would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the- railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and the great line of settlers which has flowed in upon the new territory, impose on the military an entire change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along tho wagon and stage route sof travel is no longer necessary. Per manent quarters at points selected, of more sub stantial character than those- heretofore constructed, will be required, ludcr the existing laws perma nent buildings cannot be erected without the sanc tion of Congress, and when the Sale of military sites and buildings lias been authorized the moneys received have reverted to the Treasury, and could only becu'.i. I available through new appro priations. It is recommended that provisions be made by general statement for tbe sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings as arc found unnecessary, and for application of the proceeds to tho construction of other posts." While man y of tbe present posts arc of but slight value for mili tary purposes, owing to the changed condition of the country, their occupation is continued at great expense and great - inconvenience, because they afford the only available shelter for the troops. Tlie absence 'of a large number of officers of the line on active duty from their regiments is a serious detriment to the maintenance of the service. Tbe constant demand for small detachments, each of which should be commanded by a commissioned officer, and the various details of officers for neces sary service away from their commands, occasions a j scarcity in tho number required for company duties. With a view to les ening this drain to some extent it is recommended that a law authorizing t! c detail of officers from the active list as Professor of Tactics and Military Science a. certain colleges and uni versities be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the army. Attention is asked to the necessity of providing leg islation for organiz'ng the army and disciplining the active militia of the country, and liberal appropria tions are recommended in this behalf. The reports of the Adjutant General of the Ai my and Chief of Ordnance, touching this subject, fudy set forth its importance. The report of the officers in charge of education in the army shows that there are seventy eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary recommends the enlist ment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank, pay and commission of a sergeant. - An appro priation is needed to ' supply : the Judge Advocate of the army with | suitable libra ries, and the Secretary recommends that the corps of the Judge Advocates be placed upon the same footing as to promotion with other staff corps of the army. . Under the existing laws the Bureau of Military Justice consists of one e Ulcer, Judge Ad vicate-C.cner.il, and a corps of Judge Advocate* of eight officers of equal j rank (Majors), with a pro vision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four when reduced by casuality or resignation to that number. The consolidation of the Bureau of Mill, tary Justice and the corps of the. Judge Advocates upon the same basis with other stuff corps of the army , would remove an , unjust ; discrimination against deserving officers, and subserve the best interests of the service, j Especial attention is asked to the report of the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of our national defenses. jf From personal inspection of many of the fortifications referred to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the recommend ations made, and state that their incomplete and defenseless condition is discreditable to the country. While ' other nations have been increasing their means for tarrying on offensive warfare and attack, iug maritime cities, we have been dormant In preparation for defense. .', Nothing of importance has been done toward j strengthening and finishing our case mated works since our late civil war, during which the great guns of modern warfare and the heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships came into use among nations, and . our i earthworks," left by the sudden failure of - appropriations I some years since in all stages of ineompletion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the element*. ■ 7/7 Mississippi AND Columbia" rivers." ,i ~, 7 7 Two great rivers of the North American Conti nent, the Mississippi . and Columbia, have their i navigable waters wholly within the limits of the United States, and are of vast importance to our i internal and foreign commerce."!.' Th i permanency I of the important work in the South : Pass of the Mississippi river seems now ,to be assured. There has been no failure whatever in the maintenance of the maximum channel during the six months ended August 9— lost. This experiment has opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an im provement upon the permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among the peo ple abroad, and especially among ' the communities of , the " Mississippi valley, whose commercial j ex changes float _ an ■ unobstructed channel safely to and from the sea. The comprehensive improve ment of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a mat* ter of trans— importance. _ These great water* ways _ comprise Ja " system of land transportation spread", like.. network- over a large portion of the 7 United , States, and are . . navigable . to the i* extent sof " many " ':', thousands 'of miles. Producers and consumers alike have a common in*" | tercet in such uniqnaled facilities for cheap trans-" j port at ion. Geographically, commercially and polit i ically they are the strongest tie between the various sections of the country. These channels of communi ■ cat ion and interchange ore the property of the nation ; Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and I the plainest principles cf public inter— require their intelligent and careful supervision, with ' a view to their protection and improvement' and the enhance- - ment of their usefulness. The channel cf the Colum bia river, for a distance of about 100 iniies from it* ' mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars, which j occasion : serious '"delay* -; in f navigation "• and j" a ! heavy exp-- use for lighterage^ and towage. V^A depth . of at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured \ and maintained, to meet tr-e requirements of the ex ' tensive and growing inland and own commerce it I - ' : subserves. The most . urgent need,' Lowever,' for this great water way is the permanent improvement of the channel at the month of the river. . ;_ :■ V -77 :7 HARBOR OF RF.FrGE. ,'".: . . Z~.

DEPARTMENT BCILDIXG. V} The completion ol . the new- building for the War Department is urgently, needed, and estimates for continuing its construction are especially recom mended.'.;' The collection of books, specimens and records constituting the Army Medical Museum and Library are of national importance.- The Library now contains about 51,500 vol— and 57,000 pam phlets relating | to " medicine, surgery j and allied topics. . The contents of the Army Medical Museum consist of 22,000 specimens, and are unique in the completeness with which both military surgery and diseases of armies are illustrated." Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only to the United States, but to the woild. There arc filed in the record and dispensation division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, together with a great quantity of papers, embracing | the original records of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside from their historical value, these records are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement of large numbers of pensions and other claims, for the protection of the Government against attempted frauds, as well as for , the benefit of honest claim- - ants. These , valuable collections . are now iv a building which is peculiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended that an appropriation be made for a new fireproof building adequate for the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these valuable c llections. Such building should be ab solutely fireproof. No expenditure for mere archi tectural display is required, j It is believed that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to exceed $250,000. ,77:". ril'GClrmON IN REGARD TO GENERAL GRANT. I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much 1 1 bring that momen tous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for the recognition of distinguished military merit, author izing rank and emolument ,to be conferred for eminent services to the country. A law author izing the appointment of a Captain-General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to compen sation, retirement and other details, would in my judgment, be altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the country. - ' THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretory of the Navy exhibits a successful and satisfactory management of that Department during the last fiscal year. The total expenditures for the year were $12,916,639, leaving unexpended at the close of the year 82,141,682 of tbe amount of the appropriations. The appropria tions for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $15,095,061, and the total estimates for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1882, ore $15,953, --751. The am unt drown by warrant from July 1, 1880, to November 14, 1880, was $3,041,570. The recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy that provision be made for the establishment of some form of civil government for the people of Alaska is approved. At present there is no : protection of persons or property in that Territory except such as is offered by the offi cers of the United States ship Jamestown. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka because of a fear that without tbe immediate presence of national authority there was -" an | impending danger of anarchy. The stops taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both the white aud Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for the method of restraint does not, in my opinion, now exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving our people as at present without the ordi nary Judicial and administrative authority of an organized; local government, serious conse quences might ensue. The lows provide only for the 7 collection of , revenue, . protection of "7 public property and' the transmission of mails. The problem is to supply local rule for a population so scattered and peculiar in its origin and condition. The natives arc reported to be tractable and self-supporting, and if properly in structed doubtless would advance rapidly in civiliza tion, and a new- factor of prosperity would be added to the national life. I therefore recommend requi site legislation upon this subject. The Secretary of the Navy has taken steps towards the establishment of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the requirements of our commercial rela tions with Central and South America, which are rapidly growing in importance-. Locations emi nently suitable, both as regards our naval purposes and the uses of commerce, have been selected— one on the east side of the Isthmus at Chiriqui Lagoon, in the Caribbean Sea, and the other on the Pacific coast at the Bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors sufficiently commodious on the isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less than 100 miles. The report of the Secretary of the Navy concludes with valuable suggestions with respect to the building up of our merchant marine service, and which deserve the favorable considera ion of Congress. ' V ;,;/, . POSTAL AFFAIRS. 7 ..".•'',-. . The report of the Postmaster- General exhibits a continual growth and a high state of efficiency of the postal service. The operations of no depart ment of the Government, perhaps, represents with greater exactness the increase in population and business of the country. § In 1860 the postal receipts were $85,180.471 ; in 1880, the receipts were $.3, --315,479. All the inhabitants of the country are di rectly and personally j interested in having proper mail facilities, and naturally watch the Postoffice very closely. This careful oversight of the people has proved' a constant stimulus to improvement. During the post year there was an increase of 2,134 postoffices, and the mail routes were extended 27, --177 miles, making an additional annual transporta tion of 18,8*4,191 miles. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at $38, --845,174, and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leav ing a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treas ury of 81,630,737. ■ The Universal Postal Union has received an accession of almost all the countries and colonies of the world maintaining . on organized postal service, aid it -confidently expected that all other countries and | colonies now outside ( the Union will J soon unite - therewith, thus . real ising the .grand ! idea of : the founders of : the Union, of forming, for purposes of international mail communication, a single postal territory em bracing the world, with a complete uniformity of postal charges and conditions of international ex change for "all descriptions of correspondence. ! To enable the United States to do its full share of . this great work, additional legislation Is asked by the Postmaster General, to whose recommend ation es pecial attention is called. ':. The suggestion of the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to en courage by appropriate legislation the establish ment of American lines to carry the moils between our own )«rts and those of Mexico, Centra! Amer ica, South' America, and of the trans-Pacific coun tries, is commended to the serious consideration of Congress. I The attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in re gard to postal savings bonks. . V ,1~.- "7 ' THE 

FEDERAL COURTS. ' v|*|]§_§ The necessity for additional provisions to aid in the transaction of the ' business of ' the . Federal Courts, becomes each Ti or j more apparent. | The dockets of the Supreme Court and Circuit Courts to a great number of circuits are incumbered with the constant' accession of ' cases. In the former Court, and in many instances to the Circuit Courts, years intervene ; before it is practicable ■to bring cases to a bearing. The Attorney-General recom mends the establishment of an intermediate Court of Errers and Appeals. It is recommended that the number of Judges of Circuit Court in each circuit, with the exception of the Second Circuit, should be increased by the addition of another Judge. In the Second Circuit that two should be added, and that an intermediate Appellate Court thould be formed in each circuit, to consist of Circuit Judges and a Circuit Justice, and that to the event of the ab sence of either of .these Judges the place of the ab sent Judge should be supplied by the Judge of one of the D : strict Court* in the circuit. j Such Appel late" Court eoald be safely invested with large juris diction, and 7; the V; decision* $ would 7; satisfy suitors in many cases .when 'appeals; would still be allowed to the Supreme Court. The expense in curred for] this ' intermediate : Court j will : require a very moderate increase of the appropriations for the expecscs. of the Department of Just ice.Vi This recommendation is commended to the careful con sideration of Congress. It is evident that the delay of justice, iv many instances oppressive and disas trous io suitors, now necessarily occ rs in the Fed eral Courts which will to this way be remedied. jrK"; ' 777777 : ..V THE I ASS. 7 ; : ■ 7 J 7 The report of the Secretary of the Interior pre- j sen an elaborate account of the operations of that , Department during the past year. ■ It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian * affairs appear to be ! in a more hopeful { condition ; now than ever before.* j The Indians have' made gratifying progress to agri- ] culture, herding and mechanical pursuits. .; Many"! who '. were j a few y ears ; ago in , hostile - conflict with the : Government are < quietly settling down j on farms, where they hope to make their permanent - homes, building houses and engaging in the occupa tions of civilized life."; .The introduction of ; the freighting business among . them has been remark ably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and ■ remunerative ' employment, and :in stimulating their ambition to earn their own sup port. Their honest}-,' fidelity and efficiency as car riers are highly praised. V.The organization of a po lice force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservations, and in I exercising a- wholesome" moral : Influence among the Indians themselves. " I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the recommendation that the pay of this i force be increased, as an in duce ent to the best class of young men to enter it. Much care and attention has been devoted to the enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians. Schools at the Indian | Agencies have been estab lished, and the erection of buildings has been begun for several more;, but an increased appropriation for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to accommodate the i largo number of Indian chil dren of school age. ' The number offered by their parents from all parts of the country for education in the Government schools is much larger than can be accommodated with the means at present availa ble for the - purpose. g The J number |of ■ Indian pupils .. at "' the Normal 7 School , at -.. Hampton, la., under ; the . direction of . General Arm strong," has been considerably increased, and their progress highly encouraging.:' The Indian school established by the Interior Department in 1879 at Carlisle, under the direction of Captain Pratt, has been equally success!—. ".' It has now nearly 200 pu pils of both sexes, representing a great variety of tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. Pupils In both these institutions receive not only an elementary English education, but are instructed in housework, agriculture and useful mechanical pur uits. A sim- I— school was established this year at Forest Grove, Oregon,' for the education of the Indian youth on the Pac'flc coast. In addition to this, thirty-six In dian boys and girls were selected from the Eastern Cherokee* and placed in boarding schools iv North Carolina, where they are t» receive an elementary English education and training to industrial pur suits. The interest shown by Indian parents, even among the '-'.so-called V. wild ;-, tribes, '■ in the educa'ion of their children is very grati fying, and gives ; promise that the results accomplished by the efforts now making will be of lasting benefit. The expenses of Indian education so far have been drawn from the permanent civili zation fund at the i_ iposal of the Department of the luUrior, but that iuud is now so much reduced that the continuance of this beneficial work will in the future depend on appropriations by Congress for the purpose, and I would venture to express the hope that Congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of good results to perish for want of means for their support. On the contrary, the increase of the number of such schools appears to me highly advisable. The past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the Indian tribes. An agreement has been made, with the I'tes, by which they surrender their largo reservation in Colsrado to consideration of an annuity to be paid them, and agree to settle iv severalty on certain lands designated for that purpose as farmers, holding individual title to their land in fee simple, in alienable for a certain period. In this way a costly Indian war has been avoided, which at one time seemed imminent, and for the first time in the his tory of the country an Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to settle in severalty and live as individuals under the common protection of tho laws of tho country. The conduct "of the Indians throughout the country during the past year, with a few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla warfare carried on for two years by Victorio and his bond of Southern Apaches ho* virtually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil. The disturbance caused on our northern frontiers by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge in the British Dominion, are also likely to cease. A large majority of his followers have surrendered to oar military forces, and the remainder are appar ently in progress of desintegration. I concur with the Secretary of the Interior In expressing an earnest hope that Congress will, at this session, take favorable action on the bill providing for the allot* ment of lands on the different reservations in severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring a fee simple title, unalienable for a certain period, and eventually the disposition of the residue of the re servation for general settlement, with the consent and for the benefit of the Indians, placing the latter under equal protection of the laws of tho country. This measure, together with a vigorous prosecution of our educational efforts, will work a most important and effective advance towards the solution of the Indian problem, and in preparing for the gradual merging of our Indian population into the great body of American citizenship. PUBLIC LANDS. " A large in reuse is reported iv the disposal cf public lands for settlement daring the past year, which marks the prosperous growth of our agricult ural industry and the vigorous movement of the population toward our unoccupied lands. As the movement proceeds, the codification of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to ■ regulate tbe disposition of public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I therefore invite the consideration of Congress to the aocomponying draft of j a bill made by the Public Lands Commission, which was communicated by me to Congress at its last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desirable. -.. The attention :of Congress is again colled to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands, and the rapid and indis criminate destruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to that end Is now generally recognized, in view of the lawless character of the depredations committed and the disastrous conse quences which will inevitably follow their continu ance. Legislation has again and again been recom mended to arrest the evil and preserve for the people of our Western States md Territories the timber needed for domestic and other essential uses. ■ ■"-"''' "...■ THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. The report of the Director of the Geol rgicol Sur vey is a document of unusual interest. The con solidation of the various geological and geographical surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which heretofore operated . upon an independent ; plan without concert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to all th OS3 industries of the country which dependt up:n" the development of our mineral resources. The labors of the scientific men of recognized merit who compose the corp3 of the geological sur vey during the first season of their field operations and inquiries, appear to have been very compre hensive, and will soon be communicated to Con gress in a number of volumes. I The Director of the Survey recommends that the investigations carried on by his Bureau, which so for have been confined to the so-called public land States and Territories, be extended over the entire country, and that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose. This would be particularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other . mining interests in the Mississippi valley, and of the Eastern and Southern States." The subject is commended to the careful consider, ation of Congress. : 7 .7 MORE ROOM NEEDED. - I The Secretory of the Interior talis attention to the ' want of room 'to the . public building of the Capitol, new existing and in course of construction, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed on the public records. _ Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in different parts of the city for the location of public edifice*, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the separation of offices belonging to the same Depart ment impedes the transaction of , current business. The Secretary suggests that the block surrounding Lafayette Square on the east, north and . west, be purchased as a site for tbe new edifice for the accom modotion of Government oil— leaving the square itself intact, and that if such building* were con structed upon a harmonious plan of architecture they would odd ' much . to the beauty of j the na tional " capital, ; and would, . together ; with J tho Treasury and new State, Navy and War Department building, form one of the most imposing group of public edifices in the world. : . • .. . ■ -"■•' -'"■ vvSSI -'

EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS. 'a.-#r|l|ss?j(i. 9 Tlie Commissioner of Education reports a contin "] ued increase of public interest to educational affairs, and that public reboots generally throughout the j country are well sustained.' I Industrial training is " attracting deserved attention, and colleges for in struction in the theoretical and ; practical in agri culture and the mechanic arts, including j tbe I Gov ernment schools recently established for, the in struction of the Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public "estimation. *_s The j Commissioner \ asks special attention to the depredations committed on lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore made is repeated and' urged, that « an educa tional fund be set apart .':,, from the ;".' net proceeds 3of . : the sales of j public | lauds ■'- an nually, the income of wlieh" and . th 8 remainder of the net annual proceeds to bedistributed on some satisfactory plan to States at d Territories and the District of Columbia. • The" success of. the public schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress made under the intelligent direction of the Board of Education and the Superintendent in supplying the educational requirements of the District with well-trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. Acts of Congress from time to time, donating public lands to the ceveral States and Territories in aid of educational interests, have proved to be vvißo meas ures of public policy, resulting in a great and lasting benefit. , It would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislative wisdom, which lias been so fully vindicated by ex perience, to the District of Columbia, -- '' 7 • 7" THE 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. . - 1 again commend the general interests of the Dis trict of Columbia to the favorable consideration of Congress. The affairs of the District, as shown by the report of the Commissioners, are in a very sat isfactory condition. In my annual messages here tofore, and in my special message of December 15, 1879, 1 have urged upon the attention of Congress the , necessity .of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac , adjacent *j to the capital, and I am constrained by its importance to advert ' again to the subject. These flats embrace an area of sev eral hundred acres. They are an impediment to the drainage of the city, and seriously impair its health. His believed that with this substantial improve ment of its river front the capital would be in all respects one of the most attractive cities in the ' world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is necessarily the place of residence of persons from every section of the country engaged in tho public service. Many others reside here temporarily for the transaction of business with the Government. It should not be forgotten that the land reclaimed will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it, and tl.e : navigation of the river be greatly im proved. 1 therefore again invite the attention of Congress to the importance of a provision for this much . needed and too long 7 de layed improvement. The water supply cf the city is inadequate. In addition to its ordinary use throughout the city, the consumption by the Gov ernment is necessarily very great in the navy yard, arsenal and various other deportments, and a large quantity is required for the proper preservation of the numerous parks and cleansing of sewers. I recommend that this , subject . receive the early attention of Congress, '.- and that in making provision for "an increased sup ply, such moans be . adopted as will have in view the future growth of the city. Temporary expenses for such purposes cannot but be wasteful of money, aid therefore unwise, as a more ample reservoir with corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed. I commend again to the attention of Congress the subject of the removal i from their pres ent location of the depots of the several railro.ds entering the city, and I renew the recommendation of my former messages in behalf of the erection of a budding for a Congressional Library, the comple tion of the Washington monument, and of liberal appropriations in support of the benevolent, re format. and penal institutions of the District.
