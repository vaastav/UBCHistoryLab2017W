The stock market was firm yesterday. Governments were a fraction blgbsr. Gold closed at 146 K a 115 V The rise in gold and the better toae of the European advices occasioned more buoyancy and firmness in com mercial circles yesterday, and prices were generally higher. Cotton nnd petroleum were favorably affected, and prices were decidodly higher. On 'Change flour was higher. Grain was also higher. Pork was irregular. Beef was steady. I.ard was Armor.

The Srnatt on thr Factdmrn'* BMrflU. |\ The IToiuhp adopte-1 yesterday the Stevens joint, resolution as amended by Hie Senate ? to wit: by striking out all that portion which pro posed to hold the two houses in regard to the elections, &c.. of Southern members to either subject to the action of the joint committee, and which, meantime, proposed to refer all papers and motions in regard to such elections for Congress to the joint committee without debate. The Penato simply refused to surren der to a joint committee its constitutional right to judge for Itself of the elections of it* own members, and the gag upon discussion which the Stevens resolution, as sent over from the House, proposed to accomplish. As adopted, the resolution provides a joint committee of nine members of the House and six of the Senate to inquire into the political condi tion of the late insurgent States, and to report thereon to the two houses. As passed by the? House, the resolution, if carried through, with or without the Executive approval, would have been a law of the land, turning over both houses and the President, bound hand and foot, into the hands of an inquisitorial joint committee, with which alone should re?t the admission of any member from any one of the excluded Southern States into either house. As pruned by the Senate each house is left free to decide upon the elections of its members, debate is not cut off, and the resolution, In stead of being thrust into the face of the Presi dent as a demand for a surrender, is complete as it stands, in being reduced from the form of a law to a simple parliamentary agreement be tween the two houses, and nothing more. Thus far, then, the Senate is entitled to some credit for maintaining its own rights and pro tecting the President against the radical fa naticism of the original Stevens-Raymond caucus resolution. But so lar a s the excluded States are concerned, they :tre turned over into the keeping of this joint committee, and their prospects of an early admission into eiiher house are, therefore, exceedingly slim. There was no necessity whatever for this joint spec ial committee, each house having a regular Com mittee on IOIecUons; so that the departure from the usual proceedings in regard to questiona ble elections mean* nothing more nor less than a new and rigid inquisition, with new and rigid conditions, in reference to the Southern States. One of these conditions precedent is p'roba bly foreshadowed in the bill of Mr. Wibon, which was under discussion yesterday in the Senate, providing to maintain the freedom of the inhabitants of the States lately in rebellion. The object of the bill is to abolish all the slave codes snd negro laws of naid States making discriminations between whites and blacks prejudicial to the rights of the latter as citizens entitled to equal protection under the laws. There may be justice in this, but if these inequalities in the local regulations of the States concerned are to be removed before th(?e States can come back into Congress, Senator Sumner's plan of reducing ssid Slates to the status of unorganized Territories will be the shortest method for accomplishing the work. The views of Senator Shei mnn touching the equal rights of the Southern emancipated blacks were of a more practical character than the premature and visionary schemes of Wil son's crude bill. There is, however, one point touched upon by Senator Sherman regarding which there should be a fair understanding. When a suffi cient number of the Southern Legislatures to make the ratification complete shall have rati fied the constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery and providing for the enforcement by Congress of the freedom of the blacks, it is probable that the President will proclaim the fact to the country, and that said amendment has thus become part and parcel of the supreme law of the land. In this event Congress must recognize the Southern Slates concerned at legitimate members of the Union, or declare their action and the President's action upon the amendment aa good for nothing. If a State Legislature is valid to ratify the amendment it is valid for the election of its United States Senators. We oannot make it fleah in the one case and flah in the other. Upon this question, for his own protection, the President has the right to demand a clear understanding with the two houses of Congress. There were yesterday some other inoidental oroctedion la both branches own various phase* of the negro question, oil tending to ' develop the difficulties that lie la the w ay of Southern reconstruction m proposed by North ern radicals. Their aohemee of Southern social reorganization preparatory to the recognition of the excluded States look to their exclusion, not for months, hot for years to come; while the programme of President Johnson, with every day's developments, brings into broad relief bis superior sagacity and consistency as a patriot and a statesman. X(slc??Bvtt|wsB and America* Policy la OmIM, The Emperor Napoleon and all the Euro pean Powers, which, dlreotly or indirectly, abetted the flagrant assault upon our American system of government and policy while we were engaged in a gigantic civil war, most now see that the unfriendly effort to establish a European balance of power on this continent is utterly fotile. The occurrences of the last few days ought to oonvinoe them that we both comprehend their policy and are determined to defeat it. The President's Message, though moderate In tone and not dwelling specifically upon any case of European interfefenoe in the affairs of this continent, is very clear as to the principle we hold and must maintain. The Initiatory proceedings and temper of Congress are more emphatio. These are very significant and cannot be misunderstood. The terse and decided declarations of General Grant, General Sherman and many oilier prominent officers of both the army and the navy are full of mean ing. The decided language of the press and of public speakers everywhere demand the en forcement of the Monroe Doctrine. Upon no subject was there ever such unanimity of sen timent among the people as upon this. The public mind is directed more particularly to Mexico just now because that is a case more directly to the point ? one in which we are more immediately concerned at present. But there arc other cases involved to whicli we shall pay attention in due time. Above all we must have the general principle established that the American political system is unique, and entirely detached from and independent of the European system, and that, as the great Power of this continent, we ennoot pn-mit European interference with its institutions or destiny. Visionary theorists, assuming to bo stat<!> men, like Lamiirtine and others of bis stripe, foolishly ima<?ino we do not understand Ibis question in all its magnitude and bearings. They think we are mere politician* of the day, not looking to the future, and that wo talk loud for effect when we do not act up to it. The American people arc eminently practical, and they understand political questions intui tively much belter than the visionary statesmen of Europe. Mr. Lainartine lately published a quantity of wordy trash upon the Mexican question; at the same time he ex plains in a measure the motives that lie at the bottom of French intervention in Mexico. What he snys about giving the Latin race a prominence and making it a Tower on this continent to check the influence and growth of the great American republic in sheer non sense. There are far more of the Latin race in this conglomerate and cosmopolitan republi can empire of the United States than in Mexico and all Ccntrul America, apart from the Indians, and they certainly are not Latins. Louis Napoleon eared little about, the race; it was the political power to which he looked. He would not care if his agent, Muximiliau, were lo import half the Teutons of Germany, without a single Frenchman or Spaniard, so 111 the empire would be established, lie had other und higher motives. First, his throne resting upon a revolutionary foundation and the ruins of a republic, he looks with jealousy on the growth and diffusion of republican ideas and institutions. They are a standing I reproach to monarchy, particularly to a monarchy like his, which elevated itself upon a victory over lepublican ideas. His mercurial subjects might some day, in his lifetime or that of his heir, make inconvenient comparisons between imperialism and republicanism. Think ing there was a good opportunity during our civil war to throw discredit upon nnd weaken Ihe republican sentiment, be undertook the enterprise of erecting an empire on the Ameri can continent and on our border. This scheme was fnrored by all the Old World monarchies for the seme retFons. But besides this he bad a purely French and Napoleonic idea. Mexico is a rich mineral country? perhaps the richest in Ihe world. He wanted to have a control over this wealth for the special benefit of French commerce. Above all. looking to the future, he knew that this portion ot the Ameri can continent, including the contiguous partsof Central America? upon which he lmd designs [ >lpo? is to he. within no distant day. the high way ol the greatest commerce in the world. As the First Napoleon went to Kgypt with a riew of arresting the progress ol England in the East, and diverting a portion of the valu able trade of that rich region, so the Third Na poleon started upon the Quixotic project of checking the onward march of the United Slates, and controlling the Istbmua routes be l wren the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sen. Such undoubtedly were the prime motives of Loui* Napoleon's Mexi can policy, and sueh were the anticipated re sults as contemplated in the future. But a change has mine over the spirit of his dream, probably, by this time. If not it will come as soon as he learns the determined atti tude of thia country and the unanimous senti ment of the people. The administration itself has been forbearing, both in action and expres sion, on this matter, becan?e It was understood that Napoleon wanted time to get out of the Mexican dilemma gracefully. This impression has been conveyed no doubt by the agents or repreaentativea of bis Majesty, and both the government and the people of the United States, remembering the ancient friendship of France, did not wish to press Napoleon and the brave, high spirited French people too closely in such a delicate business. The best feeling exists in this country towards France apart from this question. The opinion ia gaining ground, however, that there 1a a want of sincerity in the representations about Napo leon intending to withdraw from Mexico, and that he only wants to g*in time till the republican government be utterly driven ont, and there bo no other on the soil than that of Maximilian. The people con sequently are becoming impatient, and onr public men are beginning to talk very deter mined If. This Is but the prelude to action. The administration conld not stem the tide of Dopulp sentiment whea Nt ?m tt should be so disposed. The govenuneat must do what the people demand should be done. The initiatory action of Congress shows plainly that the tide is swelling. It is not buncombe, and we advise the Emperor Napoleon not to regard it so. There is an earnestness of pur pose to lay deep and firm the future policy of this country ? a policy strictly American, and exoluding European interposition in the affairs of this continent No sentiment is deeper rooted in the American mind than this, and the country would go to war if necessary to main tain it. We hope the Emperor Napoleon will seriously consider these things, and act in a manner that the old friendship of the two coun tries may be perpetuated. A military man who stands in the highest position, when asked a short time since if a hundred thousand men would be sufficient to drive the French out of Mexioo, re plied, "Tea, sir; more than enough; twenty thousand of my veterans would do it" He did not underrate the bravery of French soldiers, but he looked to the fact that we should have the mass of the Mexican people with as in such a war, and should hare a superior base and better means of operation. If needed, however, we could raise several hundred thousand men ? a great many of them veterans ? almost at the tap of the drum. The world has witnessed the military and naval power as well as the boundless resour ces of the United States, and we need not dwell on them to show how capable we are to meot any contest This country will avoid war if possible ; but we cannot shut our eyas to the possibility of such an event. Looking at the situation of things on the Rio Grande, and at the spirit of our people and the army, it is not improbable that something may occur to lead to a conflict. Where an unfriendly or hos tile spirit exists difficulties are likely to arise ; and frequently great wars follow trivial events und?*r snob circumstances. We regard it, then, ui the highest importance that our government should have a perfect understanding with the Emperor Napoleon at once as to his position in Mexico, and as to the fixed policy of this coun try regarding the affairs of the American con tinent A Hew President for the Ferocious Fe nian*. The affairs of the ferocious Fenians appear to be in a oomplete Donnybrook muddle. Infllead of abusing and destroying the vile and bloody Saxon, the O'Mabony and Roberta cliques are defaming and attacking each other. Practically speaking, the Irish republic in this country is without a government. O'Mabony has been tried, condemned and deposed by the Fenian Council of Ten, and yet at least half tho Brotherhood refuse to recognize Mr. Roberts, who has been voted by his nine colleagues into O'Mahony'* patent leather boots and sofa cushioned chair of State. The quarrel between the two factions increases in bitterness hourly, and such elegnnt epithets as " traitor," "swindler," "thief" and "spy," aro bandied about qnite indiscriminately. The only person who, by common consent, can settle these terrible difficulties is Mr. James Stephens, "the C. E. of the I. R. ? that is to say, the Chief Executive of the Irish Rebels. We iiave already published ftill accounts of the recent miraculous escape of this gentleman from a Dublin prison, and the conjectures in regard to his whereabouts. The best authori> ties assure us that he has crossed over from Ireland to Paris, and is expected in this coun try by every steamer. At Paris be will meet with Mr. John Mitchel, the Fenian Ambassa dor, who was sent off with thirty thousand dollars in gold some time ago. As the troubles between O'Mabony and his rivals in the Brotherhood have been of long standing, the Chief Executive must know all about them, and Mitchel is likely to post him upon every detail which has escaped the Head Centre's memory. Under those circumstances it Is more than probable that when the famous Stephens comes to this country he will bring Mitchel along with him, and that he will at once end all the quarrels of the Brotherhood here by removing both O'Mahony and Roberts and appointing the gallant, irascible and vexatious Mitchel in their stead. With John Mitchel as its new presidont the Irish republic in New York would become at once formidable and respectable. Mitchel can write and fight, and plot and rebel, and rule and make money, and scare the British lion better than any other Fenian who can be named. He has had a large and varied expe rience of rebellions and insurrections. He has been in jnil and out of jail on both continents, and is an Irish patriot of the first whiskey and water. His name alone would be a tower of strength. The British government would know just what to expect when he took charge of affairs. John Mitchel, unlike John O'Mabony, would not be satisfied with a revo lution without a fight. He wonld feed tbe Fenians on vitriol to keep tbem in martial trim, and blow up the Senate with a keg of powder if they dared to question his authority. Daily parades, weekly ructions and monthly invasions of Vnn?da wonld form part of bis programme and maintain tbe warlike spirit of his followers. After every fight he would call loudly for more subscriptions, and, instead of being forced to peddle scraps of waste paper, called bonds, tbe funds would roll in upon him like a flood. Neither would he allow tbe Fenian excitement to die out after a single outburst. He would nurse it and fan it and stir it up continually. Here is the great Irish republic without an organ. Does any one suppose that Mitchel wonld allow that? His first mere would be to start a national news paper, fill it fnll of blood and thunder edito rials every week, and whip the lion and tbe unicorn up one column and down another until he had fairly exhausted those royal beasts. As for subscribers, every Irish wo man, and Irish man, and Irish child would be compelled to take this paper and pay for it, under penalty of being treated as an ally of England. There would be some thing grand, imposing and picturesque In an Irish republic with Mitchel at Its head. Be would ride up Broadway on a big horse, with a sword at his side and a feather in bis bat and the green flag flaunting defiance to bis foes. No one would dare to ridicnle the Brotherhood or to throw cold water apon any of its pro ceedings were this doughty duellist its repre sentative. As for trusting the Fenian ftmds anywhere about the Tribune office, Mitchel would laugh such an idea to scorn. He would take care of the money ; he wonld take care of .UftUhiaUfci btttlw vwty rite (fee Irifb p?o pie something to ahow for tt to the form ?l % paradea, processions, reviews and a row now and then, instead of absorbing It all like a sponge or squandering it apon a grett house in Union sqnare. For these reasons ve hope that John Mitchel will come over fromFranoe in the same ship with the O. E. of the I R. and be immediately chosen the new Feniai Presi dent ' ' Spain and Chile ? Thk Future Pouct or the Spanish Government. ? Our latest advices from Europe indicate that the reports! bach- j out of Spain on the Chilean question was in correct. Lest there should be any mlnake on the subject the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken the trouble to declari in twe official despatches his intention of supporting Admiral Pareja and th< honor and dignity of Spain in South Amerita. His colleague, of the Marine, not to be behind band, announces that the crews of dl prim teers not manned and officered by Chilean ) will be treated as pirates by the Spinish an * thorkies. "These are brave words, mj masters;" but we renture to thiik that. ) after all, our first information will prove oor rect. V Spain backed out of Mexico Then Um French went there, and backed out of 8? Domingo after an enormous expenditure o \ men and money, she is not likely to maintaii her position in Chile in the face of the re monstrances of all Europe and the now stafa ' of America. Her own people are dissatisfie and almost In open rebellion, her exchequer I bankrupt, and overshadowing hor attempte aggression on the South American continen as the recent comments of the Madrid Epo< hare shown us, is the spectre of this great r public, "accustomed to action, possessing grei military resources, proud of her triumphs ta of the spectacle she has just presented to tl world, and atoource of anxiety to the strong? nations of Europe." Evidently, if the repo of the Spanish back-out is not true at the pi sent moment, the Spanish government w begin to see in a very short time the nocessi of making it true. Wanted ?
