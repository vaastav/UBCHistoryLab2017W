It is even doubtful whether the Crittemli'ii resolution de claring that th'j only object in carrying on tho war is to re-establish the au thority of the Constitution and the L" nion, and that when this object is ac complished -the war ought to cease, which was tabled in the House on the 4 tli inst. could now be carried through tho two branches of Conjrress. It is not tho maintenance, of, the Constitution nor t!io prmcrvation of the Union of the thirty-four States how euisting,Jmt tho 'negro and., Ins status that seem likely to absorb the greatest attention and consume most of the time of Congress during tl e present session. There are fearful .indications that .a party may this very winter obtain the control of Congress and thq Executive, which will not hesitato to trample- the Constitution under foot and wreck the Union for the sake of effecting their scheme of negro emancipation. At this momentous crisis, the coun try must look to tho old Democratic Union party for its salvation. If there is no hope here, all is lost. : Never in ill the past was there so urgent a cal upon the Democracy to awake to a re alizing sense of its mission and its du- tv; for never were the Constitution and Union assailed with such sleepless vig ilance and deadly hostility under tho mask of pretended friendship:' ' ; It is said that the Constitution .and the Union are upon trial in this' war. If this be so, it is becoming every1 day more and more evident that they can only be maintained and preserved by the conservatism and principles of i the Democratic party, which has hereto fore shielded thcuiffom the assaults of both-open" arid secret foes.

These three powers ore essenti ally distinct and carry with them 'dif ferent necessities and diffcreut liabili ties.

This is the war-making power, and it will, if applicable to the rebellion, justify tho extreme position of the abolitionists. , But the question at onco arises, is it applicable? " In answering this we must , have a clear idea of what the rebellion is. It is simply armed resistance to existing institutions. : The- government, there fore; in repressing it, only perform a work of restoration. And in this con nection it will be evident that Congress has hot here, as in caso of war, a .dis cretion as to whether they will or will not act. . Thcy must . suppress insur rection, because they are absolutely bound to enforce all ' laws of the land and maintain the authority of the "gov ernment over all citizens. Nor for the same reason can they make what peace they please with rebels, as they can with a foreign enemy; -Nor can they impose upon rebels any different gov ernment from that which is recognized by the constitution, because that wolud be to change the institutions of the cn tire' country, instead 'pf forcing men tp obey those which actually exist, i ; "Vet!, as we hare seen, under the War making power, they could do "alt. these things to a conquered nation, i 'But why may they not do to them to South Carolind, or Georgia?" asks the Abolitionists;--V Are. they. -notj in , arms against(the government, and. does not that :consti- tute war. and therefore an opportunity to exercise tjhe; warrmakihg (. power , to its utmost; extent?"

Whon rebellion lifted ud its head over a large portion of this Hopubbc and essayed to shake down the pillars of the Constitution and dronch the land in fraternal blood, it was no timo to bo splitting hairs, as to whether Conjrress or the President should first exercise the power.
