TRADES Tarei j COUNCIL iderts should become senators, there would have been in the chamber dur-j ing the period of 18C1-C2 five members' of this class Van Duren, Tyler, Fill more, Pierce and Buchanan. In 1825- 26 Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Mon roe would have been sitting; In. 1857 61, Van Buren, Tyler, Fillmore and Pierce. Since 18C8 the number of sen ators of the ex-presidential class would never have risen above two. It is pos sible that the very fewness of surviv ors of presidential terms in any recent time has militated against national ac tion that would keep them in public life. DAILY STORY.

Arrayed in the whitest of serge appar el, he has made Washington shiver with astonishment. The burden of Tuesday, Dec 11, 1906.

One rising after an other took place, only to be suppressed in the end, when the leader or leaders were, If apprehended, executed. The counties into which Ireland, is divided were each In those days ruled by its sovereign, whose name was preceded by the letter "O."

He tottered out of the senate while the president's message was being read and made for a wait ing carriage. A stiff breeze blew his coat tails wildly about and his thin frame shook like a reed. A capitol policeman made bold to take hold of the old man's arm as he tried to mount the steps of the carriage and assist him to enter. Fiercely the New Yorker turned on the cop. "What are you do ing, sir?" snarled the senator. "Only trying to help you in your carriage, sir," politely replied the bluecoat, with a tremor in his voice. "Get away from me," snapped Senator Piatt imperious ly; "I don't need the help of you or anybody else to get into my carriage," The policeman scooted . back to hi3 post. Question of Kx-Presldents. The story of Mr. Roosevelt's desire to enter the United States senate at the close of his career In the White house, is still in circulation, says the New York World. Meanwhile, John BIgelow renews and presents in pamphlet form his argument for a con stitutional amendment under which re tiring presidents shall become sen ators without further action. "Our Ex-Presidents," reads Mr. Bigelow's ti tle; "What Shall We Do for Them? What Shall They Do for Us?" The idea of giving senatorial places to former chief magistrates of the re public is very old.

Mr. BIgelow meets the point Bquarely. "Each senator shall have one vote." This is a proposition to overthrow the principle of state equal ity in the senate, without the accept ance of . which the constitution itself would have failed of adoption. Objec tions to this change are not met by Mr. Bigelow's argument based upon differences in state populations. It was because there were big states and smaller ones that the rule of two senators each was fixed. Representa tion on a popular basis was left to the other house of congress. Until the last spark of Jealousy be tween states shall be extinguished there will be little hope for Mr. Bige low's scheme entire. General consent might be obtained to a proposition that former presidents should sit as honor ary members and advisers of the sen ate.
