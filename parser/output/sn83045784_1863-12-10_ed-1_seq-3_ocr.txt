1 I I ? ? II - WASHINGTON. "LIBBHTT A*r> UNION, NOW AND FORKVRK, ONI AND INSEPARABLE." THUR8DAY, DECEMBER 10, 1863. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Annual Message of the President of the United States was yesterday ooinmunioated to both Houses of Congress, and will be found in another part of today's Intelligencer. If on other occasions during Mr. Lincoln's eventful term of service he has been oalled to dis o&ss questions of more imminent concern, it is safe to say that never has it been his duty to make re oommondations and suggestions on topics respect ing which there was more of just solicitude in the breasts of patriotic men, or respecting whioh the public ouriosity had beei more generally elioited. At a time like the present, when the very ele ments of our political institutions arc melied by the fervent heats of civil strife and political con tention, and when the hearts of many are failing them for fear of the things yet to oome on the land, it would be unpardonable either to cherish or to affect indifferenoe with regard to the views and purposes of the Chief Magistrate of the coun try, olothed as he is with powers so tremendous, and Which, according as they shall be wisely or unwisely direoted, must tend so largely to determine the des tiny of tho country for ?ood or for evil through all ooining generations. It is significant, as marking the new sphere of ideas into which the country has entered in the progress of eveuts, that if hitbeito, since the out break of the war, the chief interest of these an nu 1 expositions ot the President has attached to the enunciation of his mili'ary policy, it is to-day the civil policy which he proposes to pursue as re gards the so-called Seoeled States that engages the ?largest share of public concern. Accordingly it is that portion of the Message wh'nh is devoted to a consideration of this subject in its various relations which will rcccivo the most attentive perusal and be made the theme of the most elaborate exegesis by oritical commentators anxious to discover and eluoidatc the Presidential thought on this momen tous subject. We have not ourselves as yet had ti;no to pon der all the views of the President uuder this head with the care which their complexify and the im portance of their relations u.ust be held to demand at the hands of alt dispassionate men. Wc are frank to say, however, that, on a first perusal, the general tone of the Message under this head strikes us favprably, and, while we are not at nit sanguine ?s to the degree of success which is likely to at tend tin particular mode of proceeding marked out by the President for the " reconstruotion of the Unitn," it is gratifying to find that he gives no place in his system to that pestilent political here sy which proposes to obliterate State lines in the South, and to throw all the civil as well as social institutions of that section into hotch-potch, for t\ie sake of educing a "Cosmos" more impractica ble than any that Plato ever dreamed of in his ideal Republic; and whioh, if it were practicable, would needs be reared on the wreck of all that gives symmetry and stability .to our political sys tem. The President, in elaborating this part of his Message, has obviously fi.und the hardest part of his task in the difficulty of reconciling with bis projected civil policy the "edict of emancipation," yhich purported to be i?sued purely a-i a " military measure," and which he seems to be perfectly aware is not of a nature to be easily and harmo niously co-ordinated with a civil polity that shall recognise the normal supremacy of tho States over their domestic institutions. This embarrassment furnishes the best possible commentary in clucida tion of tho difficulties attending that paper pro clamation, which, without being in itse'f a help to the military power of the Repnblio in suppressing the rebellion, promised to be a hindrance in the work of restoration, unless the obstacles it int'r posed oould be in some way successfully turned. And it is perhaps in a clear perception of this (ruth, that the President in another part of his ifessagc alludes to "the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments." "Care," he says, "has been taken to shape" his proclamation of amnesty and his plan of.restoration "po at to avoid embarrassments fiom this source." The method proposed by the President for turn ing the obstacles which he perceives to be placcd by the "committals" of the proclamation in the way of restoring " the Union as it was," strikes u* as being the best that can be dovieed. Remitting the finality of the edict to the decision of Congress or of the Supreme Court, ho could not have done any thing mere, even by a revocation of the pro clamation ; for, whether the proclamation be re v >kcd or maintained by him, the question of its legal effect would equally come up for final adjudi cation by the Federal Judiciary?the only differ ppce being that, in the one case, tho question yould bo whether, in spite of its revocation, the slavos tf the insurgent States were not actually emancipated by it, and, in the other case, whether jt is competent for the President, in the exercise of his " war powers," as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to abrogate tho laws of a State re cognising slavery. Wc need hardly say that it is tho duty of all good citiaens " to abide by and faithfully to support all aots of Congress pissed during tho existing re bellion with referent e to siaves, so long and so far asf not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision ot the Supreme Court;" and the same may be said of the proclamations of the President under this head, it bting under stood that such "faithful support" of the lat ter, any more thrn of the former, does not pre clude that loyal opposition whioh is candidly and hoaestly o^ndacted, under the Constitution and Laws, for tho purpose of enlightening the publio judgment. Where the Congress and the Courts of the United States have a right of revision, the people of tho United States ocrtainly have a right of free discussion, and where the people of a State are required to take an oath, "subject," as the President expresses it, "to the modifying and abrogating pjwer of legislation and supreme judi cial decision," they have a right to bring th?if ?J legitimate influenoe to bear ia controlling the one and protecting tbe purity of the other. The President, we may add, ahuwu a disposition to conciliate as far as practicable, without renounc ing the form oi the emancipation edict, the natural sensibilities of the Southern people, when he pledges his aoqaiesoenoe in any provision whioh may be adopted by a restored State Government " in relation to the freed people of suoh State, ' which shall reoognise and declare their perma ' nent freedom, provide for their eduoation, and 1 whioh may yet be consistent, as a temporary ar ' rangement, with their present oondition as a ' laboring, landless, and homeless clais." Whe ther this " temporary arrangement" in regard to a " landless and homeless olaas" shall be called "apprenticeship" or "servautage," it must ncoes sarily be one of dependence, and we h pe there is no one whoso love of slavery is so intense that he would desire to perpetuate its name in association with its admitted evils. We have not time at present to analyze the ietails of the President's plan, but we shall do so at an early day, and in the mean time would commend it to the oandid and thoughtful con sideration of our readers. We cannot, how ever, dismiss the topic to-day without expressing the hope that the President's political friends will treat his piesent plan of pacification with more consideration than they accorded to that which formed the burden of his last Annual Message, and which ho commended to them as being " sure" to restore the Union, while, at the same time, open ing the way for the peaceful extinction of slavery. THE 

ENROLLMENT ACT. We observe that many of our contemporaries are discussing the propriety of modifying the provi sions of the enrollment act under several of its heads, and especially that feature of it which au thorizes a commutation for actual service by the payment of three hundred dollars. It is well kuown that this clause has been made the occasion for casting much obloquy on the whole law and on the Administration, which was held responsible for its passage. Yet the friends of the law and of the Administration have not hesitated to vindicate the measure from these representations, and have de fended as beneticent and just the very clause against which it was sought to exoite popular odium and prejudice. It is known that we have uniformly felt it our duty to express the opinion that the law was not fairly open to the objections brought against it on this ground, and that the "commutation clause," whioh appears to baro excited tha most opposi tion, was in reality a provision which wrought no comparative harm to the " poor man" simply be cause it gave to the man of moderate means an op- ? portunity of making the Government his agent for the procuration of a substitute. It is not to be forgotten that this latter, and this alone, was the object of the "commutation clause;" and it is truly said by the New York Evening Post that "to abolish the commutation clause, as it now stands, will have no other effect than to rai<e the price of substitutes.' And this will be a hardship not upon the wealthy, but upon members of the most numerous?the middle class. The wealthy will not suffer; they can affoid to pay a higher rate; it is the artisan, the farmer, the mechanic that the heavier burden will oppress." The Secretary of War, in his forthcoming re port, will doubtless state tho number of soldiers whom he has "procured" as substitutes for the drafted men who paid the three hundred dollars for this purpose, and with these data before it Congrfps can better judge as to the necessity of entirely repealing the clause?:hus justifying the objections brought against it?ar of raising the sum fixed as the price of commutation. Tho motive and the effect of the clause, as origi nally framed and adopted, arc, we doubt not, cor rectly stated in the following letter of the distin guished gentleman who was the recognised "lead er" of the last Congress : Lancahtick, Auuuht 27, 18G3. Df.ahFik: In answer to your inquiry, my opinion ia. that tbe payment of the three hundred commutation aud the furnishing a substitute have precisely the same effect. Either of them tr-e* the drafted man from further draft for three year*. He ia in effect in service, either by bim ?f|f or another. The payment of the three hundred dol lar* makes the Qoverument Lis agent to procure a substi tute. The Qoverument haa consented to act at auch ag? nt. 'i be law eaya he may, " uii or before the day fixed for bia appearance, furniah an acceptable aubstitute, or pay auch sum, not exceeding three hundred dollar*, for the prornratitu of sivii substitute; and thereupon the per aon furnishing auch substitute, or paying the money, shall be di?chaig' d from furtbet liability under that draft." No one doubts thit furnishing a aubatitute excuses for three year*. To give a different effect to the paytneut of the commutation money aeenia to me little lean than an absurdity. It ia a very mischievous misconstruction, which, il need he, I have no doubt Congress will correct. Ed. KMI.I.Y, Emj. '1 HAPUKtlH fSTKVENN. THE NEW CLERK. 7 he rcadi r will perceive, on a reference to tho pro ceedings had in the House of Representatives yes terday, that its organization was completed by the election of a Clerk nnd of the other regular officers of the body. The election of the Hon. Edward McPhkrsON, of Pennsylvania, to the responsible office of Clerk reflects equal crodit on the House and on the estimable gentlemau who has rco.ived this tribute of oonfidenoe at the hands of a body among whom there are very many who have had t*tc best opportunity of knowing his worth, from former associations with him in the public oounoils. He was, it will be recollected, a member of the last Congress, in which, as also in his antecedent term of service, ho ever illustrated the qualities whioh adorn the legislator. THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT In sug^estin/, to Gen. Jeff Davis the expedi ency of a ohango in his Cabinet, the Richmond Whig makes tho following extraordinary con fession : " We have a Department of State that hna not been able in nearly three years to establish relations with any other State; a Treasury Department that has failed to keep its finances from running to ruin ; a War Department in the hand* of a chief whoso whole studies and course ol life has bf*n purely and peculiarly civic; a Navy Department without a navy; a Post Office D>'parlment with a very ahacklingayateui of malla; a Department of Justice vacant ' The business of each department separately shows the want of a more maslerly band ; and tbe united powers ol their chiefs in Cabinet ooQnoil*~-if oonneils are ever held? fail to supply the quantum of wisdom the conntry needs." i.The Phi'adelphia Bulletin saya there has been no denial of the statement tbat eoal operators have combined to mapend mining for a time, to keep up prices, and sd.l that the actual cost of producing and transporting coal to tbat eity does not exceed five or six dollars. CRUCIAL TEST." It may be within the reoolleetion of some among our regular render* (hat, early iu the month of Oc tober last, the N -w York Independeot, an able Republican paper of the Congregational Church, propounded to ua the inquiry whether we were " glad or sorry that slavery seemed likely to be destroyed." This question, it said, was not put to us from motives of idle curiosity, but beoause il was one whioh " touched the ethioal heart of the question," and furnished " a crucial test" by which to try the hearts of men. As there was nothing in the ques tion whioh made it a difficult one for ua to an swer, we gave t? our contemporary an ezplioit reply, and took the liberty whioh we supposed to be entirely admissible under the circumstances, to propound in return, on our part, another interro gatory to the lndepondent, and one which we oon ceived, in like manner, to afford an excellent " crucial test." After taking over two months to ponder our reply to ita inquiry, the Independent, we regret to observe, is not entirely Batieiicd with it, as in deed we had already feared was the case from the long reticenoc whioh it seemed to have imposed on our inquisitive contemporary. We suspect it was only a little too ezplioit to suit the ingenuous purposes of our queriBt. But, dismissing all curious speculation on this point, we beg to remind the Independent that it has quite forgotten to make any response whatever to cur interrogatory, and, as it was put in good faith, from a simple desire to " touch the ethioal heart of the question," we take the liberty of recall ing its attention to the point, and of inviting a categorical reply to our l< crucial test," without any unmanly flinohing. It is as follows : " You profett to be very sorry for the slave. Hoto much have y?u bten sorry ; that ij, how many sl ivts <fre free to day htcause their emancipation has cost you money f" The Independent, we are sure, will admit that our interrogatory " touohes the ethical heart of the question j" for, as faith without works is dead, so it will concur with us in holding that " philan thropy" and " love of freedom," when professed by men of means, but always without any particu larsacriiice of dollars, is nothing better than sound ing brass and a tinkliDg cymbal. PIRACY AND MURDER. SEIZURE OF A NEW YORK STEAMER BY REBEL PASSENGERS FROM THAT CITY. The strainer Chesapeake was OHptured twenty nnle? N.N E of Cape Cod at 1.30 A. M. on Monday by rebels who left New York as passengers. The second engineer was killed and thrown overboard. The chief engineer and mate were badly wounded. C<pt. Willett aud crew were landed here this morning. This daring act of violence and murder was first pub lished in the New York Express of Monday evening, but in so mysterious a manner as not to inspire confidence io its verity. The following is the form in which it appealed in that paper: To the Editors of the New York Exprrss : Yesterday, about dark, I picked up a bottle in the Hound, with a white rag tied about the neck, and found th s paper 1 send it to you, thinking it might be of iuipo. tance. I put one of my boys &?hore at Harlem, and rend it to you. I will be in the cily to-morrow, and will call on you Last night, abont twelve o'clock, the captain ami < fleers of the PatapMo were stised by a band of ruffians, between twenty and tliiitv iu number, who had taken pas?a?re on boa>d at New York They were ail thorough'y armed, and atnou* their number weie engineers and earing matters, who imme diately took charge o1 th* vesi-al.

Two Hours La er ? There ha* ?>e*n a great bustle on deck. A vessel is alongside, and cannon is being trans fern d to < tie vessel. The craft alongside is a at earner, and. from what. I cau see of her through my flute room window, she is )>ierce<l for cannon. Krom a conversation I overheard I gathered'hat there were two oilier vessels near by to co operate with them.

Tbe aecoid engi neer of tbe a'eamer waa shot dead and hia body thrown overboard Tbe first engineer was shot in th>* chin, but wan retained on hoard. The firat mate was badly wounded in the groin. Eleven or twelve shot* were fired at the Captain. After bei'ig overpowered, the Captain waa put in irona and the paaaengera were notified that they were priaoueis of war to tbe rebel Government. PURSUIT OF THE PIRATES. Portland, (Mk.) Drc. 9.?Deputy Collector Bird baa applied to the Washington authorities for permisaion to diapatch the Agawam, tbe new gunbott now finishing here, after the Cbtsapeake; and, in the mean time, the Collector ia fitting her out with guns, men, and proviaiona. Two detacbmenta of soldiers have been transmitted for the expedition by Biig. Gen. Raw ley, from the conscript camp, and Major Andrews, from Fort Preble. Shi will sail about six o'clock thia evening, under command of Capt. Webster, of the revenue cutter I).?bbiu Citizens are volunteering as her crew. A steamer cauje to od Pai tridge Island about one o'clock thia morning, nud the crew and paasengera, except the firat engineer, were put on board a boat and sent to thia city. Tbe steamer then sailed in an easterly direction' and waa subsequently aeen alongside of another vessel. It ia auppoaed ahe took from her a aupply of coal. The attack took place about twenty milea west of Cape Cod. Capt. Willett and the paasengera of tbe Ciiesapeake ar* now at the Mansion House. The steamer and cargo were valued at $180,000. The Chesapeake sailed from New York on Saturday, and was one of the regular line plying between New York and Portland. It will be recollected that it waa the Chesapeake that captured Capt. Reid and hia pirty when they a tempted to run away with the cutter Caleb Cushing | from the harbor of Portland. CONFLAGRATION IN NEW YORK HARBOR. MANY VESSELS BURNED. New Yokk, I)kc. 9.?About half-paat one o'clock this afternoon a fire broke out on the acbooner Flora Temple, loaded with hay, and lying at the dock above Che?**0p|,pr atreet, en the North river The fln-r.ea aoon extended to \ number of hay barg>-s and acboonera in the vicinity, anil they were aoon one burning flame.

M?uy of our reader* will remember that two or three weeks ago public meeting was invited by a uuuiber of ra.pecUL?,e citizens to inaugurate measures to reeruit * M a in this city, with the view of relieving our people as ar as possible from the impending draft, which it an nounced to take place early in January next. i be results of the meeting thua called have been the appoio iuf nt of W j,rd Committ-es, each consisting of ten members, vybo have subsequently organized and .elected ?una H. Semmkh, b*q aa their treasurer, and are now about to enter upon their more active labora, by calling upon their fellow-citizens and aolicitia?( contributiona to euable em to carrj out the humane and patriotic objects of iheir appointment. We earnestly be.pesk for the gentlemen composing theae committers prompt and generous contributions. All olaaaea ? j UnPt?P,e arW iotereet*d in tl?e ?ucceaa of their effort., and all abould give liberally according to Iheir means, aa whatever la bestowed will in some degree diminish the ur ens and alleviate the btUictiona which would neces sarily be entailed upon thia community by another draft; for it will, we thiuk, be found cheaper in the end promote b) private bounties the enlistment of sin ge men, and who by enlisting will also eecure the liberal bounty of the Government, than to permit our woiking population to be atill further reduced by an in discriminate draft, which would add to the public obliga tions already incurred in the way of providing for the comfort of auch additional families aa might be rendered more or leaa dependent in consequence of the absence of their lawful guardian.. And it is highly important that what can be accomplished in aid of enlistments abould be done speedily, for the rea aou that even now in the procurement of recruita we are brought into competition with other and more wealthy towns, which competition must coutinue to increaae and become more active n* tbe season advances. Another motive to alacrity in thia movement ia the very large quota required of tbia District, and to supply which will test to tlu< utmost the capacity of our limited popu. on- Our quota is larger, proportionately, than has been assigned to any other city or Kite, ao far aa their re spectlve quotas have come under our uotice. We can only account in part for this disparity by supposing it to arise from the very thorough and comprehensive enroll ment which has been made here in comparison with that made in other parta of the country. On this point the official figures we have at band will enable us to contrast it wah only two other enrollments, vii: In the city of Baltimore, having a population of 212,400, the enrollment ia 21,652, being but 2,325 more than in thia District, with a popula ion of only 75,000 ; and in the Htate of Connect! cut, having a population of 400,100, the enrollment is but 39,345. Every reader will see at a glance the vaat dis parity here presented. The enrollment at Baltimore, to be proportionate with that of tbia District, ought to be 51,734, and that of Connecticut 118,565. The deficiency in the first case is 33,062, and in the latter 70,220. The enrollment of the District (10,327) is even more exces "'V? tLan were those of the cities of New York aud Brook I n, which upon being brought officially to the notice of t ie Government were annulled and new ones ordered But, aa we have before i-aid, the enrollment will account only in part for the large quotas assigned to this District They range from thirty-three to fifty percent, an<i iiM-me instances two or three hunded per cent above the quotas of other places. The draft here last summer required three men out of every ton enrolled. The number of names drawn was 5,784, leaving as the remainder of our enrollment 13,543 ; and now, under the new quota, (2,730.) with the fifty per cent added, if another draft shall take place 4,005 additional names must be drawn, which la rather more than three in every ten, and which will exhaust more than half of the entire enrollment In com ptriaou with this requisition upon the District, having 75,000 population, we find that the new quota of Con necticut, with a population 400,100 is only 5.432; that ol tbe city of Boston, with a population of 178,000, is only 3,500 ; and that of the city of Philadelphia, with a popu lation of 502,000, is only " shout 5,000." (Thes* are tbe only data we have before ua at the moment of writing, all b?#ing derived from official statements except the quota of Philadelphia, which waa obtained from a respectable newspaper published in that city ) To baae these quota, on population, and make them equal to tbe quota of tbia District, that of Connecticut should be 18,102, that of B .aton 7,000, and that of Philadelphia 22,111. We shall not attempt further to account for these ex cessive demands upon the District. Th-y cannot be recon ciled with tbe requisitions upon any State or city. It has been Miggested to us, and the suggestion is perhaps well founded, that our quotaa have been made disproportion ately large owing to a denial of due credits to the District for troops heretofore supplied. We ar$ iuformed that no credits whatever have been given except for the troupe obtain -d by tbe drait of tbe paat summer. Tbia, if true will shed some further light on the subject. Theae credits ought to be allowed, and meat probably will be, when the fact of their omis.ion shall have feet* made known to tbe proper authorities It is a well-attested fact that in the beginning of the war, and at the most critical period for the s?f-ty of the national capital, the p.opie of this District, whose popn lat.on is coiifined mainly to tbe city of Washington, fur nished troops largely in excess of any quota which in fair ne,? could have le n allo'ed to them ; and that, in three months' mm especially, they 0 .ntnbntod greatly in ex cess of several of the smaller Sta'ea, and, if regard be had to their respective populations, in excess of any of the States * At that important juncture, be'ore the troops from the States had reached the capital in numbers suffi cient to protect it. nearly three thousand of our citigena bad promptly enrolled themselves as three months' men, and were duly accepted by the Government'; and at a later period in the same year one thousand three years' men were also organised here and duly muatered into tbe publ c service More troops of both descriptions were recruited and offered, but. in v.ew of tbe influx of troops from the States, their .ervices were then declined. Subsequently, however, a second regiment of three years' w?re cepted from tins District, Le.id-a several companies of cavalry a?d .nfantry, also three years' men, wbo were re cruited here, but, in order to obtain acceptance, were in corporated with some of the Stato regimentj. All the troops thus accepted ha** faithfully performed their duty The U?re? months' men, after undergoing an active campaign, in protecting the railroads to the *itj, guarding tbe fords and .bote* of the Upper tfotomac, and some of thern forming the adduce of the small army which first marched juto Virginia at the time of tbo capture of A-lexandrla, weie honorably discharged at tbe expiration of their respective terms. The three years men, with t .eir ranks reduced of ??Urip by the oaaua|tjM of ^ camp and tbe #eld, are still in the service. And recent y, two regiments of colored troojia have been re cruited aud organiz-d in thia District,and were lately dis patched w ith full ranks to tbe seat of war. None of these troops, as we ara i.formed, have been credited to us-the roa*,? foy this ou.ia.ion bein, ? r<(. gards the white tr;ops, that, a. the Predentin hi. pro clamation had made no call upon the Di.tnet, they were voluntarily tendered and accepted ..".orplus troop,." We have heard no reason for dating credit for th? colored troops. is a to alter of bi.tory that " aurpfu. troops," ?? '..ey are called, l.ave been accepted of Indiana, lllino.a, audjjOhio, aud probably of other State., and that .uch States have received full credits for all of them It is ow ingtotiMse credits that Indiana was altogether relieved ? We extract tbn following enumeration of the three months volunteers from the annual report of the Secretary of War which was laid before Congress in December, 1801. Tbe same report acknowledges the acceptance from the District, prior to that time, of one thousand three years' men. Tbia table shows tbe number of three months men furnished, and tbe states whence they came: Connecticut 2,230 New Jersey 3 06 Delaware...... 775 New York........ lOlHri HI1'" '? 4 IMl Ohio 10*23b Indiana ............ 4.0H6 Pennsylvania ....... J9 |yji Iowa............... !KH Khode Island........ i 9h[. Maine 7tift Vermont.... 7hi Mas.achnaetta 3,435 Virgin.a ,70 MOhigan........... 781 Wisconsin......... 792 M ssouri 9 350 Dial 1 ict of Columbia". 2,H?H New Hampshire 779 77,876 from the late draft, Mid that Ohio aod Illinois wer? par* tially relieved from it, the latter haviug had comparatively but a few iu?u to raise to meet the quota* then required of them It ia also a matter ot history that Massachusetts received full credit for the two colored regiment* organ iced in that State, though they were recruited from all parti of the country ; and that Mary laud has not only re ceived credits for all the oolored troopa recruited in that State, though some of them were alavea purchaaed and freed by the Government, but baa alao obtained credit for five or aiz hundred rebel prisoners, who, haviug taken the oath of allegiance, were recruited at Camp Delaware and other places into Maryland regiments; and it ia aleo known to the public that orders have been issued directing full credits to be giveu to Missouri, Kentucky, and Tenneasee for such colored troops aa may be reoruited or purchaaed in those several States. In view of all these facta i*e think our people may rea sonably couclude that if there has been any failure to cre dit troops from this District it bat arisen simply from an overaight, attributable perhaps to the anomalous political organization of the District, oocupyiog as it does the posi. tion ot a Territory, without having any direct representa tion in the national councils, or any executive chief whose business it Is to Iwk after and protect its interests in national matters. The President, however, being virtu ally our Governor, possesses the power to do full justice in the matter complained ot, and we feel confident that he will cheerfully accord it whenever the facts are properly brought to his knowledge. We have devoted to tbia subject more space than we in tended when we first took up our pen to make an appeal in aid of the Ward Committee*!, because we are iuformed that the facta stated have attracted attention and caused some complaint, as well as because some of the lets hope ful of our citizen# despair of success in meeting the pre sent requisition of the Govornmeut by the means proposed. We trust that the despondent will bo encouraged to rely upon the justice of the President, and thai all of our citizens will go to work harmoniously and energetically, and in good faith endeavor to meet the new demand made upon them. And if the effort thus made sLall fail we may then wiih the more propriety ask for the large abatement of the requisition to which it appears the Dis trict is so justly entitled. THE 

ABANDONED PLANTATIONS. The correspondent of the New York Evening Post writes from Washington as follows in reference to the abandoned lands and plantations in some of the Southern States, which are to be sold for " direct taxes: " " The Government has ordered a sale of the abandoned lands in its possession in the States of South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, and Tennesee. The sale, which is peremptory, is to take place on the lMth day of January next. It will be remembered that the sales iu South Ca rolina were stopped by order of Gen. Gillmore, who did not understand his busin< ss. The President has ordered that the sale shall take place on the day fixed, and none of his subordinates are to interfere with this sale.
