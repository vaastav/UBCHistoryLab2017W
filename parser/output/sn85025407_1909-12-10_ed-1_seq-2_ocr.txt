Dec 10, • 1009. Ye. ti e .rv of fraud is getting monotonous, but the cry of “negro” i is worse. Painless surgery may male appen dicitis unpopular, since it despoils the patient of the pleasure of harrow ing friends with the narrative of tor- i tore* anticipated and endured. At the 11th street wharf Hsh mai ket. Washington, it is said that never before in the history of the fishing industry on the Potomac have fresh fish been so scarce as they have been thi* fall and winter. Ordinarily at . ihic seas ' ? r* rfw steamers bring up forty 'tv barrels of perch, bass can-, catti- 1 ’ and other varieties of ri\er fih, but this season if they have a half d. n h rrels a trip, they are doing We;., Receipts from the fish-' eries on the Virginia coast near Nor folk and from the New Jersey coast fisheries a e also very light, and to meet the den nd frozen trout and hlnefish 1 ;ve een put on the market, j and are nanding good prices, j The fisher i • i operating nets along j the !owe her are becoming greatly discouraged, and unless catch im proves they will cot ont and return h-me Kish have been becoming fewer a- d fewer each year in the 1 judging front the il! success the fisherman are hav-: ing. there are but few left. “Thera has been a breaking up of j range herds, 1 ' Secretary Wilson says, “consequent upon the enforcement of the ‘no fence' law of the national government aijjg by the encroach ment of the sutlers upon the ranges, made pftwtSle by the practice of dry ing. Not all of the cattle have ’VYy trow i,v,. ee* au jdO’ises. A great portion' ■r"gone to farms for ma turing and finishing, largely upon j corn. This extra demand on the; i* reflected in corn pric s, ’ wl'.i'lT are now higher than they have been since the records of the Depart ment of Agriculture began, in 186 b, except for 1 ISumming up the results of an inquiry, it appears that the causes for the increase of meat are : (1) The* average profit of 38 per cent, charged bv the retailer; (- ) the scarcity of cattle, clue to the up of Jhe ranges; (3) the increased cost of fattening beef for market, due to the advance in the! price of corn ; and, ( 4) the increased consumption, due to the growth of population and the ability of the working people to purchase a bette ■ class of food and indulge their appe tites for meats because of increased wages and continued prosperity. I'he gathering of more than one thousand Sisters of Charity in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, on Tuesday of last week for the celebra tion of solemn mass was an event of a certain degree of picturesqueness as well as historical importance. The ! occasion was for the payment of j honor to the memory of the Ameri can foundress of the Order, Mother Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton. The name is familiar to Maryland, for it was in Baltimore that the work of founding the Order took place, in an humble duelling now forgotten, and • if was Emmitsburg that the first con vent was opened. Originally the membership was very small, and in j I *l2 it had increased to only twenty, while now the Sisters of Charity are 1 seen and known everywhere. The j benevolent work they have perform-! ed £ould not be estimated; in all, places- in the hospital and upon the , i battlefield—the white bonnet and the i i dark habit are the symbols of succor 11 and consolation. Bather strangely, when we recall that most of the women who have founded sisterhoods in the Catholic Church devoted themselves to the i task from early youth. Mother Seton wak well advanced in life before she < undertook the foundation of her sis- ] terhcod: and, not merely that, but {f was a widow. Her inprried life last- t ed quite a number of years, when she was not even a member of the Church which now so elaborately honors her memory. She became a j*, Catholic, however, and some of her ' ( relatives also later joined the same , communion, among the rest the illus tri ms Archbishop Bayley of Balti more City.. Mother Seton was a woman not 1 only great piety but of remarkable executive ability and force of charac ter, the impress of which seems to be j erinanent. All creeds respect andj O* the Siste rs of Charity, and s paid to their gent'ene bav£\been nnsPnr* PRESIDENT TAFT’S MESSAGE. The message of President Taft sent to and read in Congress on Toes day is characteristic of the man. Its tone is moderate, and he deals with a number of questions in his own gentle but effective way. It is , * not a masterpiece in rhetoric, but simply and clearly states and deals with his subject in a matter of fact | manner. The President in his message fails to call the attention of Congress to legislation* concerning the trusts, railroads and conservation. He says he will call attention to these things in special messages. These were among the things that public looked forward to with eager interest We believe however that 1 the President in doing this will en able Congress to pass more effective 1 legislation and deal with these sub jects more thoroughly when they arise. In h special messages these greit features of domestic economy will he more thoroughly defined than j could he done in a message which covers a variety of subjects as this comprehensive and analytical contri bution nf Mr. Taft to the messages of Ve American Presidents. In his message the President urges economy in the expenses of j the government In bis discussion lof the government finances, he says jthat the deficit of $34,000,000 which we shall have for the present fiscal {year (which ends June 30 next) j wii! be succeeded, according to con jseivative estimates by a surplus of I $35,000,n00 for the next fiscal year. This is far greater progress than the people’ever expected. A strong i recommendation of a new fort at the month of the Chespeukts Bay meets with pop whir approval. This is one for tlie most important points on the Atlantic Coast anil needs thorough protection. He endorses the urgent | needs of a policy of encouragement i for merchant marine on both t!• | Atlantic and Pacific pointed out by i President Roosevelt. The proposed reform in court procedure, which is one of Mr. Taft’s own policies, receives its due share of prominence, and the delays in both civil and criminal branches he rightly calls “archaic and barbarous.” His request for power to, appoint a commission to make a jfginnjitig to ' ward* . - T 9W , y ra "'v# ,i"” '* m - by investi gating All delays in the federal c sn And no valid ob jection, it may be hoped that j this recommendation will be speedily j acted upon. His proposal to limit injunctions is reasonable. His asser tion that the preval n -e of lynching in some parts of the land may he traced to delays of o lie-present judi cial system, will be indorsed. The proposed reorganization of the Slate department, the diplomatic and consular services, already in part carried into effect, is amplified in his message. I It. is well known that reorganiza tion is one of the foremost desires and intentions of the present admin istration, and the outline by the President of his proposed procedure in carryi g out this policy, not. alone in the Army and Navy but i.i the civil departments a* well, demonstrate the fact that President Taft has a long business head, and thatjie pro poses to use his brains ,to carry on an effective sound ecomonic and business administration. Another recommendation that will * meet with highest approval is his ! proposal to make individual fitness j and ability count in both civil and military services and likewise the need of looking to the publication of campaign expenses. He recommends that no action jbe taken at present in connection with the Sugar Trust frauds is in the , interest of the accomplishment ol : justice. As to the Zelaya matter he gives j congress no concern, thereby indica ting that the government prop sei ! to handle it without resort to war j but through the State department. The definite outline of the needs . and conditions of the country as de tailed in his message to Congaess ; ; cannot fail tc receive commendation - from the public and impress Congress j with the necessity of early action.! His message infers that there is an j expectation from the people and the i President of some solid and effective j legislation by ti e present Congress. The President in his message also congratulates the country on its j l present healthy condition and makes ; 'several other practical suggestions too numerous to mention. Mr. Hanna found out how “it happened” and before hi gets t Brough j some others wii thick over ill cause I of its happening behind tin l\i - if they get their just deserts. Tha originator* and prefect ora. ok. the fi%id will find it more monotonous get their just deserts. -—- A/J edge cf the of' jN> ork has come f the lorg-sufferingW condemn the vws. t,s commit conteiu Great Clearance Sale , TO
