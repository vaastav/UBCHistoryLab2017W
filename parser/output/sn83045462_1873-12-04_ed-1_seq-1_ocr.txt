REVEAL OF THK "SALARY ORAB" got iretty well started to-day In the House by the introduction of upwards of seventeen bills beir ;-g on that subjec . A resolution ottered by Mi.

Mr. KMridge provoked sjme merriment by the introductioii of a bill providing that trembers should pay their salary to their con stituents in constat ration for their votes. An other enthusiastic democrat proposed a bill pro viding that members should serve without sal ary or mileage.

Letters ol President Orant, Senator Spencer, and Mr. Farror, room clerk at th? Wist Kr.d Hotel, Long Branch, are given as evidence, and surtlcieiitiy establish the Senator's innocence. They are as follows : ? Execitive Mansion, > WaSHIKOTok, l>. C., October 20, 1*71 \ Dpah .1 i rxiK Much lias been said in the pub lic print* rela'ive to your colleague. Senator Carpenter, during his visit to Long Branch thi* last summer. One charge made against him I know to be nntrue. He spent an hour or unr" ?ith me during the evening of hisstty, an l I can answer as to his being at the time strictly sober, giving no evidence ?f having been drink Irg to mark its e.Tect at that time.

My Dear.Senator 1 was at Long Branch the day alter you were there last summer, or, at all events, the day the first telegram appeared in the New York Tribune concerning your visit bt re. I went to the West End Hotel, and was told by the clerk that there was not a vacant room in tlie bouse, and had not been for several days; that they had been compelled to refuse ?:anv persons. I .-aw the Tribune correspondent (Mr. Hams deli) a few moments afterward, and. referring to the telegram in the Tribune. I asked him what it meant, and whether there wa9 any truth in it. He admitted to me that there was no truth whatever in what would be implied in the telegram. X afterwards talked with the room clerk upon the same subject, an,I he told me you were refused a room only because every one in the house was occupied. I am, very sincerely, yours, (iKll. K.

Iloiee Dear Sir: In regard to the charges against Senator Carpenter at Long Branch, the facts are simply these: Mr. Carpenter came with sevfral others, and there wan not a vacant room in the bouse. I told him so, and gave him a note of introduction to the Ocean House. If the President hail called at the same time for a room I should have to!d| him the same thing. Mr. Carpenter was neither intoxicated, nor guilty oi any improprieties whatever. Georije H. Farrvr, ltoom Clerk West Lud Hotel. The Timer says editorially: '? The true tacts have been known to us for some time. The husband of the lady, who, for v. ry natural reasons, desires not to bring hi wite's name before the public, and therefore does l ot wi>h to publish anything under his own signature, some time since called on us and Informed us that the charge was utterly false, and requested us, in case the slander was kept up, to publish a statement of the facts.'' The Philadelphia I'rett, referring to the matter, gays: "Of the lady, we can freely state that we have known her lather, mother, brothers, and sisters lor many years, and wo have never met a more irreproachable woman than herself, or a more respectable family than that whose r.ame she bore before her marriage. For her sake and theirs we have deplored the publicity that has been given to the charge agiinst a public man who has done so much honor to our public councils as Senator Carpenter." The Washington correspondent of the Haiti more American has the following to-day: "It wa> rumored yesterday that Senator Car penter would take the tirst oppmtunity to make a peisonal explanation in the Sei:at*; with re gaul to the charges affecting his character, and which appeared originally in the New York Tri bune. last summer. That he has already ttken steps to vindicate himself the editorial of the New Yolk Timet of yesterday shows. This edi torial, with the letterd embodied in it, were vety generally discussed last evening, and have been the leading topic of conversation to-dav. While those who know Mr. Kamsdell discredit the statement reflecting on ins integrity, it is thought Mr. Carpenter Stands acquitted of the -erlous charge made again-t him. It is a fact that Senator Carpenter wa< registered at the West End Ho'el, l-ong Branch,und-rthe name of llenry Carjicnter, but this is explained by Mr. f'arfar, the room clcrk, now at Willard's Hotel, as follows:?When Senator Carpenter arrived at the West End Hotel he asked the clerk (Mr. Farrar ' to register his name as Hen ry Carpenter; and, on being asked why be wanted this done, lie explained that he had come to see the President, and if he was kuown to be there, and on such an errand, be would not even get time to sleep, he would be so over run with visitors. The clerk then registered the name as requested, but on looking at his list afterward found he hail not a vacant room, ami so Mr. Carpenter hail to go elsewhere. Mr' llamtdell left here for New ^ ork last evening.' New York I>ry Goods Markbt During the past week there was a marked and contin uous improvement in the general condition of the trade; yet the aggregate distribution of gools lor that period was materially lessened by the recurrence of the annual Thanksgiving holiday, and unfavorable weather towards the close of the week. Transactions with the agen's were spasmodic. No sooner was a line of goods ?no matter how large?ottered at prices which were considered advantageous by the trade, than an instant clearance was effected to the be-t buyers in the market. This was the case with various lines of bleached and brown cot tons, also woollens, which were seized with avid it v the moment bottom prices were touched. On the other hand, agent- who showed a dis inclination to meet the market fjund themselves a nullity. The dry goods imitations at this port con tinue to decrease as compared with the two pre ceding years. Values of even the most staple productions have continued unsettled, and show a great shrinkage when compared with the opening prices of the season and the cost of im portation; but holders appear desirous to close out their accumulations at the best attainable ratrs, and are not backward in meeting the views #>f their customers us to price -V.

The wages of other cotters, helpers, blacksmiths, Ac., were also reduced, but not In so great propor tion. The cutters held a meeting last night to consider the subject. Tbe proceedings were secret, but it transpired that among other things a committee was appointed to prepare a protest against the reduction, and if necessary to come to Washington to urge it. Work, how ever, was resumed to- l?y, and will be con tinned until tbe committee reports, when tlnal action will be taken.

HOISK OF REPRESENTATIVES ? Mr. Male (Maine) offered a resolution authorizing the a| peintmcnt ot a committee to have spe cial charge of all bills in relation to the repeal of the salary bill, and to report at the earliest day practicable. A large number of bills on the subject were introduced by different members, among whom were Messrs. Hale, Poland, I)e Witt, Wells, Kurchard, Townsend, Morey, and Parsons. While these bills were being introduced Mr. Butler (Mass.) enquired if it would beinorderto take a recess to allow other members an oppor tunity to prepare bills on tne subject. [Laugh ter.] Mr. Co^ (N. V.) urged immediate action upon the question. He thought ilie House sufficient ly understood it now. "Mr. Xegley (Pa.) remarked that the gentle man (Mr. Cox) had taken all summer to con sider whether or not he would return his back pay, and he should now allow members at least a few moments to consider the matter. Mr. Cox That is not true. Mr. Negley ^aid if the gentleman had ad dressed him in the language ot a gentlemau he would have replied, but he thought it beneath his dlgr.ity no^ to do so. Mr. Co* taid that if the g -ntleman had gone to the Treasury department he would have as certained that "he had not taken all summer to return his pay. Mr. Randall (Pa.) inquired whether the specia. committee just authorized had also power to inquire in relation to the return of pay which members had already received. Ha said that Mr. Hale, of Maine, was the author of the clause in the appropriation bill which author ized member1- to draw pay since the Ith ot last March, and should therefore be familiar with the question. Mr. Halo said lie supposed the commit'.ee would be authorized to inquire into all matters affecting the salary. The point was here raised as to tne authoi ity ot the committee to report at any time. The Speaker said that unless such authority was given it might be weeks before the committee could re|>ort, as it would bo placed on the list af'er the regular committees. Questions having been raised by Messrs. F. Hoar and Stephens, it was dcclded that the House was under the rules of the preceding House, and that it would be governed under these rules until they are changed by order of the House. A large number of other bills on the subject were then introduced and referred. Mr. Beck (Ky.) lntrodnced one to prohibit appropriations for the household of the Presi dent of the United States, in order to equalize the pay of officials. Mr. V.ldridge (Wis.) offered a bill to provide for the payment by members of Congress to their constituents, of the money received for salaries, as payment for fheir votes.

The day iii?n which the ceremony will take place la not yet known. The naval vessels preparing for sea will rendezvous at Key West, and proceed from there to Havana. It 1>as been supposed the Virglnlus would be delivered at one of our own j>orts. but the pro toco! left the time, place, and ceremonies to be agreed tijion bv Secretary Klsh and Admiral Polo, who have'designated Havana tho p:>rt This is a concession on our part, and is under stood to have been made at the earnest request ol the Madrid go* eminent,who I cured that any attempt to lake the Virginias from llavatn. t ? be delivered at an American port.would lead to overt acts <>n the part of the Spaniards iiCuba, which would involve the two countries in war; while the preacnceot'an American naval force. It is thought, would Intimidate them. In cue ot a refusal to deliver up the Virginias, it will be the duty of Congress to authorize the Presi dent to taae her by force. There are now three United States vessels at Santiago?the Juniata, Kansas, .md Wyoming. It Is understood that Commander 1>. L. Braine,or the Juniata, the ranking officer, is authorized to receive the Virginias' prisoners from the officials at Santi ago, and that when they are delivered to him hewlll proceed with them to a United States port.

He had received letters to this effect lrom Spanish residents of other cities. Other speakers followed, contending that the United States bad no right to interfere with the execution of the Virglnlus prisoners, and argu ing that, according to the treaty previously ex isting between tie two governments, the pris oners could not claim protection of the Ameri can flag, as the act or carrying arms against a nation with which the I nited States wae at peace forfeited their citizenship.
