"" Entered as second-class mail matter at the post ~ ] otlice_at Washington, !>. C. Patronage and the Second Term. While the President will have his "hands full between now and the 4th ~ of March, there is one matter not likely ~ to plague him in that time. lie will .2 hardly consider patronage as related to his soco.id term until that term begins * and he has had opportunity to look p around. = * Some speculation is already in eircula tion as to how many reappointments the ^-President will make, and what significance will attach to new appointments. It may be that men now in office with good official records will he rewarded for their records. The President may decide that one good term deserves another. as, according to his friends, the "rountry lias just decided in his own case. Rut should he adopt a different policy ~"*and "pass the cake around," he will have " a majority in the Senate to confirm his ""Unv selections. The President is probably advised of " the fact that much interest attaches "in his own party to the part he will play in 19-0?whether he will care for "~*8 third nomination and try to secure it, or content himself with naming the "'man. ... .. And here is where the speculation /_ about patronage comes in. If many re' appointments are made, it is argued that * they will indicate a purpose on the President's part to keep the machine in his own hands for his own benefit. If many new appointments are made they will be searched for a sign as to the " President's preference for the succession. ** "* Today it is noted that the President's "relations with democrats of presidential J "size and mentioned in gossip about the presidency are cordial. All of them gave him loyal support in the recent cam"paign. All are callers at the White 7 jHouse. Nearly all are in office. Nearly '""all were competitors of his at Baltimore "four years ago. If the President's seeond term is a - success his party's nomination in 1920 - lull be very valuable. Hence, if he does not try for it himself, it is certain that there will be a lively contest for the lionor. And his favor, of course, will be - a most desirable asset. It is a popular ?suggestion that as Jackson named his successor Mr. Wilson may desire to name jr .his: and, as history teaches, there, was some very pretty maneuvering on the - part of presidential aspirants to get on the warm side of Old Hickory Van ?Huron, "the Fox of Kinderhook," and an accomplished courtier, turned the rir-It with his natron's aid. reached the White House. He bore no resem Fiance as a leader to his patron, but evertheless crowded out all competitors. Illumine the Monument! " " A bill has .just been introduced in the House providing: for the installation of " four great searchlights in the WashingJon Monument with the idea of "illuminating" the shaft. Far more effective than this would be the placing of brilliant lights at some distance from the ""ihaft so that their-rays would play upon "* It and cause it to glow in the darkness. Already the peak of the Monument is illumined from one side by a searchlight that is cast upon it from the roof of one of the hotels, making it a conspicuous mark in the nigh?. A full lighting of the shaft from base to capstone by a scries of lamps plac-d on the quarters at a distance would produce one of the most remarkable effects in America. The white stone of the Monument shines forth under the rays of powerful electric lamps, and with the blackness of - the night sky as a background this graceful outline would become one of the wonders of Washington. Regrets are expre sed by democratic statesmanship that the railways cannot turn their genius for organization and administration toward perfecting a system of government control that will work. Ww Jerry's I ig ?*?>r.'st lire serves to remind the inland public that the state is not entirely composed of seaside resorts. A Prophef and His Prophecy. Col. George Harvey, having disobeyed a famous injunction and prophesied ~ without knowing, has since election day been paying the penalty. He had picked Hughes, and supported his opinion with aome very cogent and persuasive rea soiling. Kate brought Wilson ; and some friend* in clever badinage and foes in a sort of derision have had a month of exercise at his expense. He replies in the current number of fcis publication, in good temper and in a way to increase respect for his talents as a political observer ami controver aialist. His examination of the earn paign, the issues, the actors and the re "" suits, is, indeed, an excellent piece of writing. - As a resident of New .Jersey doing business in New York, Col. Harvey vcn;tured his opinion largely, we may be * sure, on his knowledge of the loeal sit nation. And, as to that, he had the * . .Vr'-v-. .u>. "goods."' Both those states, though claimed with such confidence by the democratic managers, voted for Hughes in big figures. Had states at a distance, whose republicanism was taken for granted not only by Col. Harvey, but many others, lived up to their records of years, Hughes would have won hands down. How little the real situation was popularly sensed was shown by the readiness with which the Wilson supporters in the east conceded defeat after ascertaining how the strongholds in their section had voted. Evidently they had based their calculations, as Col. Harvey has his, on the influence of the east on the contest. With New York, New Jersey and New England united to the powerful states of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Indiana in the Hughes column, democratic success seemed impossible. It came to them, as to others, as a great surprise. Tlinpo id fin nnrt fit f'fil TTnrv-ov's Tin per more creditable to him than his tribute to the candidate whose defeat he deplores. He speaks of Mr. Hughes and his services in the campaign in terms of the highest appreciation. He describes him as a strong and superior man who did his best, and that best the very best, and ventures the prediction that in time there will be wide recogni- ' tion of the fact. A prophet who loses so well, and explains so cheerily and readily, is entitled to retain his place and prophesy some more. And such will probably be the result. Col. Harvey will pick his prophetic flint and try again. Potomac Eiver Power. Another postponement of the Potomac river water power project is indicated by the latest report to the Secretary of War bv a board of engineer officers. It was thought that enough was known of the conditions of the Potomac, the engineering questions involved and the economic prospect of the matter to justify the government in proceeding without further delay in undertaking this work. Vet here comes another board, setting forth the feasibility of the project, estimating the cost at $14,000,000 I and then recommending a more ex- j j haustive research into the advisability of I this development. Some doubt is cast upon it on the score of the possibility ; j that it may not produce power as cheap- j ly as it can be produced hy steam 111 xne \ near future. It is also indicated that possibly there will be no assured market for the surplus left after the govern j ment has "supplied its own requirement. For some years past the United States has been preaching conservation. Im- [ mense sums of money have been spent by the government in works for the utilization of natural resources and the prevention of waste. An expensive establishment is maintained to keep the doctrine of conservation constantly hefore the people. Vet right here at the f very doors of the seat of government , power has been allowed to go to waste j 1 for decades which might have been util j | ized economically. It would seem as j though such a conspicuous object lesson | would have been utilized as a measure I of demonstration alone, apart from the ] necessity of th^ government's rrquire; rtients. i The force of the whole conservation j | argument is weakened by the spectacle ! of this continual procrastination in the matter of a nower oro.iect of such ob- j i vious utility and feasibility. The fact that at present there is but a slight mar- ; ! gin between the estimated cost of Po ! tomac river power and steam-made power should not stand as a reason ; against immediate execution of this ; work. If there is one thing certain ; above any other, it is that coal is being exhausted in this country. Scienj ' tists may differ as to how long the coal ; supply will last, but that there is an end j to it somewhere in sight cannot be dis| puted. The government should be ihe , first to move in tbe direction of con ! serving this supply by utilizing every , possible form of natural power-making ! force. Another survey of the Potomac river ! will cost money. It will cost time. It | will lead to no assured result. It will r *ui all likelihood leave the question i where it has stood in the past, indeed where it stands today. Enough is known of this matter now to warrant ; immediate legislation looking to the beginning of this work, with no more I waste of time and power. . ; No doubt is permitted by Secretary ucdheld s annual report about tins na ! tion's being wealthy. All that it now 1 needs is attention to remaining healthy and wise. Argentina announces a need of Arneri : can bottles. There will be a large number to spare with the progress of the pro i hibition movement. An old-time dime novel Texan would ! surely have something severe to say to Mr. Sheppard about his predilection for the water wagon. ! The cold storage egg is no longer up I predated by Chicago's financiers any ; more than by the epicures. m | bpain reports an income of over $.'>00,I 000 a month from sardines, and this is j no idle fish story. Robberies. | A veritable epidemic of crime has de' veloped in Washington recently. Many i robberies have occurred, from stores and from dwellings. Thieves have broken fastenings and windows, and have taken advantage of openings. Footpads have ' held up persons on the streets. Conditions, in short, have been decidedly bad ; for some weeks past. The police are doing their utmost to check this robbery wave, but are handicapped by lack of numbers and by the circumstances in t which the thieves work. It is unfair to y, if i . . ' ' ' expect the police department to prevent this sort of crime entirely, and the detection of the thieves after the event is most difficult. The loot, is usually taken out of town and disposed of elsewhere. Money can, of course, never be traced. Householders should be especially careful at this season to see to the fastenings of their doors and windows and to take every possible precaution against entry of premises. The ordinary house fastenings are, of course, not a safeguard against professional cracksmen, to whom even the stoutest safe offers no serious obstacle. In a^l likelihood, however, the thieves who .ire now operating here are not highly skilled in their criminal trade and a?c selecting insecurely protected places for their operations. Probably .much of this crime is a result of the excessive coet of living nej cessities. The poor are feeling the pinch severely, and doubtless many people are being driven to crime in consequence. This, however, is no comfort to those who are robbed, who themselves are feeling tlje pinch of the high prices and can ill spare that which is taken from them. A Car Trackage Improvement. Changes in the Capital Traction track age system west of the State, War and Navy building and south of Pennsylvania avenue are calculated to relieve the congestion that now exists on 15th street between New York avenue and Pennsylvania avenue, and consequently on Pennsylvania avenue itself. Certain cars that now operate on the 14th street line are to be worked westward from 15th street, and by means of a loop at 19th street to be returned to their trunk without passage down 15th street and east on the Avenue. This will give service to a section that is now without transit facilities. The most important effect, however, is the relief of the 15th street arul Pennsylvania avenue congestion. The greatest difficulty in Washington's present traction system lies in the concentration of cars upon certain midcity trunk lines. The alternate passing of cars at intersections involves delays. Any blockade in the traffic halts many cars and demoralizes the service. The remedy lies in either more trunks or diversions of the traffic I such as that proposed in the present j case by means of the 18th-19th streets | loop. Anything that will carry cars to : the points of local need and at the same time lessen the use of trunk tracks in the center of the city is desirable. The woman suffrage banner displayed in Congress did not make a hit as an Interior decoration. It was too small for an entire wall covering and too large for a "tidy." Investigations are planned so numerously that this government should soon | be equipped with the finest bureau of | information the world bus ever known. | At the present writing rnclc Joe ('an ! non observes little to stand pat on, the j occasion being in the nature of a new deal with a prolonged shuffle. Only the great unorganized ronsuming public will value as souvenirs any pens used in connection with a law looking to compulsory arbitration. if prices continue to soar, the problem will not be to find a new name for | tin* 2^-cent piece, but to find somei thing that it will buy. If forest fires continue to eat up the ; timber therf will be little hope of utiliz i ing wooden shoes to combat the high ; cost of leather.

WHAT THE GOVE] Officials of the bureau of education are asking the co-operation of chambers of commerce In Education of every City where T . . night schools are X milligrams, conducted in their campaign to increase the school attendance of non-English-speaking immigrants. They believe that the most effective way of impressing the immigrant with the advantages of learning English is through, the employer. According to government statistics there were 6.588,711 foreign-born whites in 1910 employed in the various industries and lines of business activity. Up to the time the European war began this number was added to very greatly by immigration at the rate of about a million a year. More than 1.462,134 adult males, moat of whom are wage-earners, the statistics show, do not speak Knglish. According to officials of the bureau, industrial establishments in many parts of the country last year co-operated in this Americanization movement through the distribution of posters. Many manufacturing plants reported increased efficiency in- their immigrant employes when the latter had learned English. Other plants submitted fig- I urea to the experts of the bureau show- i ing a decrease in accidents among | those learning the language. One . large plant produced diagrams and J data showing gradually increased.! wages to immigrant girls who were J making themselves literate by attend-! ing school. In this establishment, which is located in New York city, classes in English, civics, health, etc., are maintained as an annex to a public school. Still other plants, say the bureau's experts, are maintaining classes in English and they find that the cost of supervising immigrant workmen is considerably reduced by the elimination of interpreter-foremen. To enable chambers of commerce and industrial establishments to co-oper- \ ate effectively in the "America first" I campaign, suggestive plans for activ- j ity have been prepared by the bureau's , division Of immiirrant ortnoa t ir?n Amonp other things, the bureau is calling attention to the fact that several large industries have given a bonus or wage increase to immigrant workmen whose industrial efficiency is increased through learning English in night j school. ! * * j Interesting experiments have been | and still are being carried on by the | Department of Agri- i Experimenting culture with various j ttt'vl. ttti. . kinds of wheat in i V/ith Wheat. order to fiTVl out jUst j how much there is in the new varieties I and new names for old varieties which j are constantly appearing. It has been found that many of the , new varieties are good, while some are j not. The good varieties are sometimes advertised, it is said, as being much i better than they really are. On the ] other hand, it has been found that varieties of little value are sometimes ; claimed to be the best of all. Experts of the department say that there are various ways by which the ! promoters of supposed new varieties I interest thetr customers. Sometime it ! is a story of wheat of mysterious or ! I foreign origin: sometimes it is a new j or unusually developed character that lis claimed. Examples of this are the I enormous tillering power claimed for i the so-called "Miracle" wheat, or the j wonderful productiveness claimed for | the branched heads of the so-called i Alaska wheat. Always, however, the officials say, the yields are said to he J , enormous. It has been found that i | sometimes the same variety is exI ploited again and again under a new j name and with a new and wonderful | i story. j After an investigation of the variety | experts of the department say that the ; so-called Alaska wheat is very old and ! has been promoted for more than a hundred years under one name or an! other, and farmers throughout the I country are still being misled. Among, i the names that have already been at - I i inched to this same wheat are: Egyp- i Mian. Eldorado, Jerusalem, Many-headed, j Many-spiked. Miracle, Multiple-head. 'Mummy. Keed. Seven-headed. Smyrna, ; Wheat of Miracle, Wild 'loose and others. Take many other crops, it is ! thought probable by the investigators j that it was introduced in colonial days, land there is evidence in the hands of the department to show that the Jeru' salem wheat "f 1 S"7 was identical with i the Alaska wheat of the present time. - The department has traced the names j ' of Egyptian, Miracle and Mummy all to one common story. The story varies in | detail somewhat, but in general it is j to the effect that when the coffin of an j Egyptian mummy 3.000 or 4,000 yearsi old was opened some wheat was found, i Heed was planted, hut only a single kernel grew. The result iner nlant proved a wonderful yielder and very ! j different from any wheat now known. This story, of course, is untrue and j impossible, inasmuch as. stored under j the most favorable conditions, seeds of; wheat will not keep their vitality more than a few years. No wheat thousands of years old has ever been known to j germinate, but. the story has served to; sell much of this seed.

COMMENT ON MESSAGE. From the Springfield Itejhiblicaii. The address to Congress was as brief as the busiest citizen could desire. Addresses to Congress during the second Wilson administration will continue to be distinguished by this quality. From the Chicago Herald. President Wilson s message carries out the pledge made at the end of the last session. It brings forth the most important items of unfinished business. From the Chicago Tribune. The President's suggestions are concerned chiefly with the railroad situation, which is the most Important in-j tftrnal problem now before the country. 

KNMENT IS DOING I certain layers near the top of this formation, though beneath the highest beds containing marine fossils. At two localities the experts found, ten to twelve miles southwest of Greeley, Col., leaves of land plants, which are so plentiful and 1 so well preserved that they think they must have grown near where they were 1 found, so that they indicate the character of the forest which grew on the low, sandy shore of the cretaceous sea, as well as the approximate position of the : shore. . * * * An interesting study has recently . been made By the bureau of foreign and domestic commerce , Exporting to of the best way to do i & business with Australian I, Australia, merchants. This study was undertaken because of the general feeling that on the conduct of our present great trade with Australia will depend in large measure the success of our future trade with the island continent. The report made was not concerned with the size of the markets nor the prospects for selling goods, but was devoted exclusively to the details of carrying on trade already secured. American exporters should pay particular attention to their correspondence, say those who make this study. It takes two months to get a reply from that far country, and it is therefore necessary to tell the whole story on each occasion. Another very important point th^t is urged is the fact that the typical American sales letter which "has a punch" is not at all suitable for the Australian trade. The managing director of the largest business in Australia told the investigator that more harm is done by such letters than by any other one thing. The more important firms are familiar with formal English, correspondence, and they resent as discourteous the curt, familiar letters so frequently used in this country. It is also very important, it is pointed out. that the American business man should get the point of view of the Australian merchant, especially at the present trying time. The experts of the bureau call special attention to the absurdity of allowing tactlessness and petty unreasonableness to bring about misunderstanding between the peoples having so much in common as Australians and Americans. * * * The navy is saving large sums of , money, and has been during the past few years, officials of Navy Y^rc* the department sa>- lj-v _ . increasing the indusiiconomies. trial activities of the , various navy yards throughout the I country. [ According to those who have been i in the closest touch with this work there are-a number of yards which, up f ! to the time that the industrial activities were started in earnest, were a | irirain on uie iniiimxn ?.? v?v > . but which are now not only self-supporting. but have actually, in addition ^ j to paying the cost of their own mainI tenance. helped to decrease the cost of ! I manufactured materials. In addition to ] this these yards are now much more f valuable from a military standpoint, inasmuch as they are better prepared, in 5 case of war. to refit ships, repair dam- ' aged ships and supply the fleet with mines. t I During the past four years the num| her of men employed in these so-called ' ! industrial yards, ten in number, has in- ' creased from 16,898 to 24.382, and their 1 daily pay roll has increased from $46,- 5 027.35 to $73,091.12. This increase, as ( is generally known among manufac- ' turers, means that if tho work is done;' in a businesslike way the proportion- j* ate overhead charges are reduced, J which means a more economical work - J ing of the plant. This has been the,' ! case, it is said by the department's of j fieiais, with several of these navy yards. 1 Taking for example the cost of re- ' pairs made in the yards to our own ( vessels, in 1913. according to the sta- , tistics, this cost amounted to $6.19 per 1 ton for the total tonnage of the navy at that time. In 1916, figured on the ( j same basis, this has been reduced to! , $.">.40 a ton, a.showing all the more re- j, markable when it is considered that , over half of this expense was for mate- 1 ( rials, principally iron, steel, copper nnd|, brass, and that these materials have ad- j. vanned from 50 to 100 per cent in cost ' during that time. The output in manu-j, factured products that go on ships has j \ also been greatly increased, with a cor- i responding decrease in the cost of each j j article manufactured. ! Take, for instance, the torpedo sta-h I tion, which is located at Newport, R. I. h i At this station, so it is said, bv doubling', | the number of men employed, the out- ii put of torpedoes has been increased and | ! other like material 40ft per cent, and ; j these torpedoes are now being: made at < j 25 per rent less than they could be | bought from an outside commercial j ' concern. In another case, that of Ports- i I mouth, by installing its own plant j I there the navy has recovered 1,937,781 !' pounds of waste topper and brass, ' which would otherwise have been sold ' for junk, and the yards during the same period have used over 4,000,000 pounds of scrap metal in place of new metal. This represents a saving in the purchase of 6.000,000 pounds of new metal < at a time when copper and brass are at the highest point they have ever . reached. * * * An- interesting study has just recently been completed by the office of public roads and ru- | Profits From ral engineering in an , n ? t* j economic survey that i Good Roads. waB matie jn elKht [counties in each of the years from 1910 | to 1915 to determine, iri so far as pos- < | sible. the dollars and cents effect on a * i county of the improvement of bad roads. f It was found as a result of this study ? that the values of the farm lands in j these counties had greatly increased . and also that following the improve- : ment in the roads there was consider- 1 able increase in the number of sales * that were made. The increase in val- } [ues in the instances which were record- 'c led by the experts was from 68 to 194 per cent in one county, 9 to 111 per r cent in another. 2i> to 50 per cent in 'another and so on. The estimates of increase were based for the most part 1 on the territory within a distance of one f mile on each side of the roads im- r 1 proved. 1 hi one county, for instance, a careful ! record was made by the experts of the I office in 1910 of thirty-five farms lo! cated on the road selected for improvement. ?Of the seven farms sold in 1912 ' the prices actualIV paid show increases of from .17 to 116 per cent. The aver- t age value after the roads were im- 1 . proved was $28.26 per acre, as compared j with $17.31 previous to the improve! ment. In this same county in 1913 four | | transfers of farm land were on the ha- . 1 sis of $30.11 per acre, whereas the properties were listed in 1910 at only $13.S9 ' per acre. It appears that 1,451 acres r sold in 1914 increased in value $28,500. 1 or so per cent, or from $24.46 to $44.10 \ per acre. Officials of the office f^el that this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt t the good in land values that is accom- t , plished by the improvement of county c roads. c , T

Is Minted the text of a cablegram received by the State Departr. H. Surratt nient from Consul Hale - of Aleixandria, Egypt* Arrested. of the arrest there of rohn H. Surratt. wanted for complicity n the Lincoln assassination conspiracy rhe Star said: "It will be remembered that Surratt was irrested in Italy while serving in the I*apal Zouaves and afterward escaped while under guard. The Pope promptly jave the necessary order for his arrest, upon the request of our minister. Mr. King, notwithstanding there was no treaty between the United States and the papal rovprnnrpnt hindiner tho latter to irrcint :he request of Mr. Kin*?. Surratt escaped nto Italian territory and was afterward "raced into Egypt, where he was arrested is stated. "The singular charge lias been made hat the President has known of Sur~att's whereabouts for the last six months without making any attempt for his arrest. The fact is that the matter of the pursuit and detection has been in the lands of the War Department, co-operiting with the State Dei>artment. and :hat the first definite indication regarding Surratt's whereabouts received by the government was in the shape of infornation that an individual resembling b?hn H. Surratt and speaking English vas serving in the I'apal Zouaves. Direclions were promptly sent back to take the equisite steps to establish his identity md procure his arrest, and to do this cauiously. so as not to give him warning, rhe affair was managed so well that he vas seized without his having the Dast iccasion to suspect that h?> had lieen delected. In some manner, which wiH pr<?hibly he explained when the full official Jispatches reach here. Surratt managed :o break away and escape from a guard i? six men. getting into Italian territory, with which government we have a modiled extradition treaty, but hurried from he 'frying pan into the fire* by going into Egypt, with which country we have a full extradition treaty. He has now no hance of escape, as orders have been elegraphed to Admiral (Joldsborough. who is cruising in those waters, to bring lim directly here. Those familiar with :he character of John H.

In The Star of December 7. 1866, is an article noting the fact that many farmers and small capitalists who had gone into Virginia to buy small farms had sold out and returned to their former homes.

This is an er- s ? -r, ror; the area is not less f Ol XilTOrs. than 1.918,7T>0 square * miles and the population is about 12,000,000. 7n the face of such manifest 1 errors of area and population let us state j for precision, above all, because the civilized world is being asked to recognize 1 this new kingdom we should compre- r hend correctly its extent. ; Arabia for a fact is a vast peninsula i separated from Persia by the Persian t gulf, from India by the Indian ocean. r from Africa by the Red sea and arti- ] flcially by the Canal do Suez: it is attached to the Asiatic continent by the desert of Syria, between the Mediterranean on the west and the Tigris and Euphrates valleys on th<* east. It is ' 1 divided into two parts, the Tihama. or , coast region, and the Nedjid. or high places of the interior. ; South of Xedjid extends the immense ' desert of Arabia, the Dahna vast des- j ert of sand without vegetation and of , which the Arabs even speak with ter- j ror. In the mountains of Madian one j may see the musical sands which pro-j 1 duce sounds like those of wind blowing upon the cords of a harp, the voice , of the desert of which travelers speak. , The H>djaz is the best known province L of Arabia because containing the holy , cities of Mecca and Medina. Mecca is the most celebrated city of i Arabia because it is the Center of ad-j j oration of the Mussulman world. The ? "Kaaba" is a small edifice built within I a mosnuP.. tne riomi 10 w iiien nu munsulmans must turn v/hen reciting- their , prayers. Medina contains; the tomb of the prophet, who died there G32 A. I>.

The desert of Syria extends between j the slopes of the anti-Libau to the , coast and to the valley of the Euphra- ( tes and forms the northern limit of j Arabia. The Bedouin or Arab nomad ( . "badowi" is the proper inhabitant of j ; the desert. He has not changed, for J , what he was in ancient days he is. 1 ; The nomad lives in tents, the sedentary , inhabits towns or fortified vilages.

The revolt in the Yemen was still n in 1904. In that year Marshal Felzt 'asha. commanding the Turks. lost in ne year 50,000 men in fights against he rebels. The Emir Nedjid Ibn Isseoud had beaten the allies of the urks. beaten Feizi Pasha on the plaing f Mesopotamia; the Arabs everywhere in Arabia refused to pay thek* axes. In Mesopotamia the Mouteficka, powerful Arab force 10.000 strong. stacked the Turks. Finally, a detail of rent importance, the soldiers of an rmy corps from Damascus and Bagdad efused to march against their Arab rot hers in revolt. In 1906 Germany was busy in Arabia* or there was discord between England nd Persia. The political lines have ensibly chanced since 1904. the year of he Anglo-French convention; then here had passed the conference at AN eciras; Germany multiplied her in!uence in Constantinople, in Asia Minor, nd the kaiser had openly declared htmelf "protector of the Moslem world." Sometime in July. 1906, M. Eugene * ung, formerly vice president of France, in lndo-China, who was greaty interested in the Arab movement, in n article entitled: "The Powers in the "ace of the Arab Revolt," said: "Arabia wishes to become nn inde- " icndent nation and consequently throw >ff the Turkish yoke. Arabia posesses now th(? Arabs of the Turkish rmy; the well armed tribes of 8yria, *alestine and Mesopotamia; the warike and experienced soldiers of Mahnoud-Yakia ar.d Hedzoe (?) At a eiglal these troops will fall in line notwithstanding the desire of the national arty to effect a revolution without iffusion of blood." The above-mentioned chiefs are those vho preceded Cherlf Hussein in com. nand of the Arabs of Arabia. The tote as to the Arab army. Its composition, is the first time information on hat important point has filtered hrough the censorship exercised by he Turks. The reference to the tt:iional party must mean the party in Turkey then In embryo tin Turkey? md which had not yet assumed the illusory title of the "committee of inion and progress." Subsequent to the foregoing informsion furnished by M. Jung, we learned nore of the progress of the revolution In irabia. The dispatches of February. 1911. t innounced that the Iman Mahmoud Yahia ? ind the Cheikh Said Idriss possessed 80.?0ft to 100.000 combatants equipped with nodern rifles, which had escaped the surveillance of the Turkish coast guards. The London Times of February 1. 1911. published information from the British ninistry of the interior in which "Molammed Said Essen and Ali al Idriss of \ssyr. also Mahmoud Yahia. were again usy in stirring up the Arabs." Mohamned Said had proclaimed his independ:nce and appointed governors and cheikhs n place of the Turkish functionaries who nhnndnned their Dosts and had fled o the coast or to Ibha. the capital and nilitary headquarters of the Sandjak of Yssyr. The djehad, or holy war. has >een proclaimed." * * The proclamation of the djehad must lave emanated from the Turkish authorities at Assyr, because Arabs Against ,he """" (rent!, have at _ all times shown a proHoly War. gressive and liberal spirit and have always been oppo < d to violence and crimes committed under the icense of a djehad. Under the regime of the Young: Turk, in the bepinning, Hilmi Pasha, prand vizier, who had passed seven years of his life as povernor of the Yemen, and thus uncvv the country and its necessities, proposed to the Turkish chamber the follow inp plan for the conciliation and pacification of Arabia: First, the division of the Yemen into two provinces?the Pjebel. or mountain districts; the Tihama, or coastal plain. ' Second, the appointment of Imam Vnhin as the vali, or sultan, of the Djebel district, with power to appoint civil and military functionaries, and to retain and expend such a proportion of the local revenue as might be necessary for the administration of his province. Third, the withdrawal of the greater I ifn.iMcf.n frnm Sanaa til* capital, which would become the center A th?? Imam province. The accursed triumvirate at Saloniki were not to he thus despoiled of their l?rey. which, in connection with other things, they proposed to treat with the foreigner, whose aspirations lent a considerable value to everything alone the line or connected with the Bagdad railway. * It should he understood that since the insurrection of 1904 the Turks, although defeated in the field, had maintained their hold on Arabia by the occupation of the principal cities?Yamho. Djeddah, Mecca, Medina. Taif. Hoieida. Moka and Cheikh Said, where the Turks until recently maintained strong military garrisons. This occupation was fruitless. The authority of the " Han's vali was confined to the fortifications of t h ? s * cities. The tribes >f the ent're country were actively hostile and quite independent of their conquerors. and called conquerors because the conquered defied them, refused to acknowledge the Ottoman courts, refused to he conscripted, refused to pay laxes and besides they levied excessive t ?xes on Turkish caravans that crossed their territory and collected the taxes successfully by their acknowledged superiority in field fighting. Rrieflv. the Turkish conquerors of Arabia shut tip in fortified cities were In reality little less than captives. * * * Writing of this situation of the Arabs * >f Arabia in 1911. when the world was still under the delusion SToUnP' Turks that the Youn* Turk _ party was a serious a De.USlOll. anfj honest party, and tot an atrocious snare and imposition, A suggested that Hussein Hilmi Pacha, vho was an exemplary Turk, should >e returned to Arabia with plenary lowers to treat with Imam Yahia as le had proposed to parliament.

We have seen how he Grand ?'herit of A abia has met and heck mated this conspiracy. HI Hussein ibn Alt appears to the vor'd as eminently tit to assume the ontrol of the sultanate to which he spir? s. He says in his second proclamation: "1 myself, protecting the ionor of Arabia, caused Arabs to rise j n the year 1327 (1909), and in the cllowing year a similar movement was arried out under the leadership of rie of my sons. The emirs continued o support the Ottoman empire until he Society of Union and Progress apieared and proceeded to take over the* dministration of affairs and, as the i rhole world knows, the world was I lunged into the horrors of this war." 1 The cause of (Terif el Hussein is the . a use of civilization, and his recogni- , ion as Sultan of Arabia is the prayer f the just.
