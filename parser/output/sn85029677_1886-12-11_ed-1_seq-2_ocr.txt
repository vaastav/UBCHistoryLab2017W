The indications are that there will be pretty full represen tation of both Senators and Congress man on next Monday, when the gavels 1 fall simultaneously in bom ends of the Cunitol. The question which excites the most attention in the minds of the members are coming in, is whether anything can or will be done with the tariff this, winter. The high-protectionists are bound that there ahull be no reduction of purely protective duties, if it can be j prevented. The reform leaders are as ui.akjus mat some ueierence suan uc paid to the promises of tne party to which the majority belong. One of the things which the 'President is credited with saving in regard to the tariff is that it should be arranged with reler tnee to economic interests instead of political conditions, that as a parly is sue it is distracting', and as experience for several long and fruitless years has slmwa , IcaJi to no practical results, nor even points out practical melnoUs .. 4 of reform. A Pennsylvania member-elect of lhe Fiftieth Congress, who has been here j during tne week, was talking about the j surplus millions and about the proba bility of the Administration being ao e to submit a plan for their reduction. He thinks a great deal will depend upon what tne President will say and lie thinks the President has before him now the greatest opportunity of his life. It amounts to a crime, said he, to heap up needless taxes in the treas ury in lime ot peace, and if the Presi dent takes a bold stand against it he will have the country to bacK. him. Ju.-t at this time the President is giv ing the last polishing sirokej to the message with which ho has teen wrest ling lor the last few weeks. He has had a very hard lime with the figures of those suroius millions, and in trying to solve the problem tor reducing lhO;e needless taxes, so hard a time, indeed, that he hss grown nervous and insta ble and explosive over the work, to the gieat consternation of his ob5equious attendants. Secretary Manning's an nual report will deal almost exclusive ly with the surplus aud the best meth od of reducing the taxes, and it will be interesting to see whether he or the President can produce the better finan cial matter. The report of the Postmaster Gener al was before the public more than a week ago, but the report of Secretary Kndicotl will not amount to anything Ibis year, nor wiil that of the Attorney General. Secretary Bayard will maue no report, but will represent the State Department by sending to Congress j the diplomatic dispatches of the year, i lie is uot discouraged, However, by tne indiffeieuce shown at the last session ot Congress to his recommendations. Sec retary hitney will ask for live more millions this jear in addition to what has alieady been given for a new navy, and Secretary Lauaur wiil reiterate his views on the seulement uf the Indian problem. Ho advocates a generous policy on the pait of the Government towards its waids, and at the same time recom mends such measures as will result in their becoming independent of its fos tering care. Our Indian policy, ho in sists, is based on considerations of national honor and philanthropy rather than of trade or self deleuse. Last year he said the Indians as a race are lew, poor and harmless, and they have a just claim for help and protection which should be set upulously respected. lhe well worn argument that it would be chea, er to keep lhe Indians at a fashionable hotel thau as they are now dealt with, is oiten revived oy wesjern people who. come here, The argument is strictly true, but the troub le lies in the fact that the United States has no right to save money in that way The ludians enjoy no privileges that uie not iLeirs by right, and these cuu- nut he taken awaj becaue the country would make money by the act.

The following is from a Topic in the December Century. "Every indication points us to the belief that such a furth er reduction in hours of labor, even be low the eh; in-hour limit, is not only possible, but exceedingly probable, if it is allowed to come naturally, not arti ficially ; that the progress." of art and science is rapidly tending , where it is unchecked, to make less labor necessary for man's Subsistence . Nothing could be so certain to check or destroy this tendency as au organized effort by labor lo gam a forced, artilicial, and unfair ad aiituge over its employers. When hours oi labor are far above the limit possible at the time, statutory interfer- ence can do comparatively little harm. the nearer they approach the natural limit, the more due; statutory interference- tend lo drive theai u; again. Labor organizations can do very little by striving .r a legal eiglit-h.jur day, tin y can do. very much bv striving lo sweep awa passion and prejudice, by upholding peace, order, and security, the conditions of et'.i.-ient production, and by inculcating and intelligent con sideration of facts by their members.
