The report of the isthmian canal commission was sent to congress to day. The commission, as anticipated several weeks ago, favors the Nicar agua route and makes an estimate of lS9tSG4,0G2 as the total cost of con struction of the canal through Nicar agua. The estimated cost of the Pana ma route is S144.233.3-jS. but, tlm re port say3, it would cost $109,141,000 to obtain the Panama concession. The commission value the work done at S10,000,000. The report says the Pana ma route is feasible as a sea level . canal, while the Nicaragua route must be by locks, but Lake Nicaragua will furnish " an inexhaustible supply of water for the canal. The Nicaragua route has no natural harbors at either e'Jd, but satisfactory harbors may be constructed. Harbors already exist at each end of the Panama route, but con siderable work must be done at the en trance of the harbor on- the Atlantic side. "With adequate force and p!-'nt the commission estimate that the Nicar agua canal can be completed in six years, exclusive of two years - for preparation. Ten years Isestimatod to complete the Panama canal. The tr.tai length of the Nicaragua route Is 183.;0 miles and the Panama route 49.09 miles. ' The estimated eost of operating and maintaining the Nicaragua canal an Eually is S1.S50.000 greater than that of the Panama canal. The' estimated time for a deep draught vessel to pass - through the Panama canal is tweivtv hours and through the Nicaragua canal thirty-three hours. The Nicaragua .route, the report says, Is more advan tageous for commerce save that orig inating on the west coast of South America. For the gulf ports the ad vantage Is two days, and for most oi the ports on the Atlantic and Paci? one day. .The Nicaragua route is said to be better for sailing vessels on ac count of favoring, winds. Hygienic conditions also favor Nicaragua. The commission says the United states should acquire control of a strip of territory ten miles wide from sea to sea- through which to build the cnnal. The consent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica must be obtained to construct the canal, but the report says this i;ia:i easily be secured. The concession"? granted by the Colombian government to the Panama Canal Co have many years, to run and new concession can not be granted the United States. The report concludes as follows: "After considering all the facts de veloped by the investigations made by the commission, the actual situation ns it now stands, and having in view the terms offered by the new, Panama Canal Co. this commission is of the opinion that the most practicable" and feasible route for an Isthmian canal, to be under the control, management and ownership of the United States, is that known as the Nicaragua. Toute." ments on its peaceful tone, remarking that Fresiueni Kooseveic eviaenuy win not allow himself to be carried away by seusidess Chauvinists. The Neus "Wiener Tageblatt dwells on its "imperialistic character," add ing: "There lives in America a spirit, as aii 'appendant' to the Monroe doctrine formula, of Europe for the Americans, and this formula, although clad in the most peaceful phrases, pervades the message." TheDeustche Volksblatt- declares that the policy enuunciated must' ex pand American production and there fore "measures for the protection of Austrian production are required by the dictates of serf -preservation." The Austrian Volks Zeltung believes that the strength of the message lies in the moderation of Its tone, adding: "It speaks in the language of a strong man who knows he requires no sonor ous words to be heard." The Neue Weiner Journal, also deal ing with the power of ' the message, recommends its close study, so as to "find means, at the proper time, of spoiling his game." The Weiner Mergen Zeituhg, follow ing similar lines, declares that the gov ernments of all civilized states will only too soon recognize the tremendous danger that these measures constitute for the' commercial policy of foreign communities.

The liberals, about 200 in number, came down from the interior by train, hav ing paid their fare as individuals, and when they arrived In town began to fire their rifles until they intimidated the government authorities and soon had control. They appointed civil on cers to run the city. The United States cruisers Machias and Marietta, which were in the harbor, landed marines to protect the property. Great excite ment prevailed among the people on Sunday morning, November 24, when the government gunboat Pinzon ar rived. Shortly after the gunboat ar rived the foreign warships assembled and boats passed between them. Lengthy signals were also exchanged between the Machias and the Ameri can marines ashore.

President Roose velt's message to congress holds the first place In the afternoon newspa pers here to-day. The comment on it, iiowever, differs little from that of the morning papers. Strong, general ap- - proval of the pronounement, which, :is the St James Gazette says, "strikes notea of conscious strength and assur ed success," Is the pervading tone of " the editorials. "The spirited declaration for Mon roeism will cause a flutter in Eu rope!" say3 the Westminster Gazette, which continues: "If the kaiser is really of the opin ion, as alleged, that 'the . American' peril 13 the question of the future for juurope.he will find confirmation in the message. He will envy Secretary Gage's sun!us of fifteen million pound.? available for bulldin:? iron clads or other purposes, for the Amer ican rtoetriue backed bv the American surplus means that many Europeans ambitions in South America are lore doomed to failure. We do not doubt that it is the policy of this country if - called uixtn to make a choice, to stand by the United States In defense of the doctrine. We are also an American power and It was we who first sug gested the idea." After ndting that South America, the only outlet for the surplus popula tion of Europe, is largely in the pos session of the corrnpt Spanish over whom the United States throws its aegis without guaranteeing good gov ernment, the Westminster Gazette con cludes: "It-la not easy to affirm this In the interests of mankind, and when the United States, after warning Europe not to enter America, proceeds itself to step out from the American conti nent, even a theoretical defense Is dif ficult. The situation has the germs of an Immense controversy in the future." Vienna. Dec 4.
