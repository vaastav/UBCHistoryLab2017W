ROOT'S MISTAKE IS SENSATIONAL U. S. TREASURER'S REPORT PUBLISHED PREMATURELY STATEMENT SENT OUT BEFORE AUTHORIZED Estimated Receipts for Year Are $648,000,000 and Disbursements $682,075,620, a Deficit of $34,075,620 [As.«oclat«d Press] WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—SeWtor Foot of New York, presiding In the. senato today in the absence of Vice President Sherman, created a sensa tion among newspaper men. The effects were even international. Copies of the annual report of the sec retary of the treasury were In the hands of newspaper! throushout the country and Kuropo. and to be held In confidence for publication tomorrow afternoon. The report Itself was still unsigned on the desk of Secretary MacVeagh in the treasury building. By some means as yet uncertain two printed copies of the report found their way to the desk of the president of thj senate. Mr. Root is a past mas ter In the art of dispatching routino business In the senate and he deftly handed the. treasury report over the desk with the routine announcement i ustomnry In such cases. Instantly keen eyed reporters on tho senate door Hashed to tho wires the news that the report had become n public document, and tho "release" clicked off to Chicago, Ban Francisco, New York and to Europe. Tho report in part follows: "Retrenchment Is the keynote In the estimates of expenditures tor tho ex ecutive departments of the government for tho fiscal year 191! i mbodled In the annual report of Franklin ktacVeagh as secretary of the treasury, mado public today.

So long as the due relation between waste and supply is maintained, nutri tion and the various functions of the body are continued. Hut after middle life and in old age there comes a time when waste exceeds supply and when the various elements which constitute the different fluids, tissues and organs r.o longer hold their due proportion, end the principle of life itselft becomes enfeebled, the body no longer having power to assimilate new material as it once did. As old age creeps on. all the func tions gradually fail, especially those of digestion, absorption and assimila tion, and, the system being deprived of its full quota of nutriment, slowly wears out. If the nutritive and di gestive processes of old people could bo maintained unimpaired, life could be prolonged almost Indefinitely. There are many old persons in whose stomachs tho gastric function is almost entirely suspended. When tills trouble occurs the problem Is how to digest the food and get along without tho natural stomach juices. There Is but one way to overcome the effects of this condition, find that Is to -supply arti ficially to the stomach a powerful di gestive substance to take the place of the juices which it falls to secrete naturally. For this purpose there Is nothing superior to 

STUART'S DYSPEPSIA TABLETS known to medical science, as they supply the deficiency and are such a reliable and thoroughly efficient substitute for the natural gastric juices that if two or three are taken after each meal the food will be. di gested in so complete a manner that the natural digestive fluids will never be missed. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets should bo used by all old and middle-aged per sons, in order to prevent or cure the dyspepsia of old age. Through their use complete digestion of the food is assured, with a consequent increased nutrition of the body and a staving off of the sensibility and dqcreptitude of old age. This remedy is, however, not only good for the indigestion Incidental to advanced life, but Is also applicable to the dyspepsia and stomach troubles of any age, from youth up. Secure a package of this famous dys pepsia remedy from your druggist for 50c, and if you find that as you get older your digestion and assimilation become weaker this remedy will as sist the stomach in the performance of its functions, so,that the general sys tem will not suffer from the delin quency of the digestive organs. A sample package will be sent you if you will forward your name and ad dress to the F. A. Stuart Company, 150 Stuart Building, Marshall. Michigan. meet these deficits to sell either bonds or certificates of Indebtedness. "In clue course," ho adds, "it would seem that It must be made practicable to both es timate receipts with a close approxi mation to the actual, and Ho provide for their annual rise or fall by some flexible factors in our annual taxation." Reductions In the present estimates, Mr, MeVeagh declares, result from Im proved handling of the government work and the postponement of expend iture i which can be delayed in an effort to adjust Immediate expenses and re ceipts. Ho sounds a warning, how ever, that tho reductions In appropria tions will bo disappointing unless equal attention la given to other important savlncs. Secretary MncVengh reviews the or ganization, or rather lack of organisa tion! of the fiscal responsibilities of the executive and legislative branches of the government and thn reorganization thereof now In progress. He voices the hope that there will bo "constant prog ress away from the extreme disorgan ization of the past." aijd observes that "even If our country is rich, It cannot afford to be wholly unscientific in Its appropriations." 

"MARINES WILL GO," SAYS MILITARY AFFAIRS CHAIRMAN Hull Is Not Favorably Impressed with Secretary Dickinson's Recommend ation for More Officers AVASIirNGTON, Dec. 7.- Secretary of War Dickinson today received little en- couragement in regard to his rei om mendatlon for an Increase in the num ber of officers for the army. With th(! view of Impressing upon congress lilm ideas or this subject, as embodied In his annual report, he had a conference with Chairman Hull of the house committee on military affairs to day, Mr. Hull was not sanguine over tho outcome of the attempt. "Why, as late of 1901 we pave them as many Officers "s they said they would ever need for an army of 100,w0 men," said Mr. Hull as he left the see. retary's office. "Now they want TOO more. How long will those be sufn cerat?" He admitted some branches of the service should be increased, among them the signal corps. Tho chairman of the military affairs committee continues to urge the abol ishment of the marine corps as an Inde pi iiiient organisation, "Why could we not have sent the infantry to Nicaragua as well as the marines?" he Inquired, "The adveifl of the big battleships, to my mind, siKtii tles the passing of the marines."

".--As lias been fore seen, ill sale of the jewels belonging to the BUltan, Abdul Aziz, which Was to have taken place yesterday at Hotel Brouot, Was adjourned.

TAFT'S MESSAGE INTERESTS MANY FOUR VITAL QUESTIONS ARE REVIEWED NICARAGUAN CRISIS AND TARIFF ALSO DICCiSED, Chief Executive Deals with White Slavery and Sugar Frauds —Con. gress Eagerly Peruses Doc ument as It Is Read WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The first annual message of President Taft ivas delivered to congress today. It was presented In both houses by Assistant Secretary Latta, and In both houses was received shortly after 12 o'clock. In the senate, when the reading of ■■ the message began at 12:12 p. in., great Interest was manifested by both Re publican! and Democrats. There was a full attendance of sen ators on the floor of the chamber, and ns noun as copies of the document had been furnished them they riveted their attention on the printed pages. While the secretary of the senate read the president's words many sen ators hastened over the pamphlet hunting for subjects in which they were especially interested. Others proceeded in the more or derly way of following the reading from the desk. President's Message The president's message dealt with the tariff, the NlcaragUan question, sugar frauds and "white slavery." Perhaps the must important question presented to this administration is that of economy In expenditure and suffici ency of revenue, lay* the president who discusses the methods taken to meet tlie deficit. The- president declares It unwise to attempt further revision of the tariff until the tacts are at hand on which such revision can property be undertaken, 0 Bpeaklng generally, he says the coun try i^ In a hinii .state of prosperity. He notes the Increase in the tort of living, but says the tarifl is not tha cause. in those products of th« factory and farm there has been no Increase in the tariff and in many Instances a very considerable reduction, the president declares. in beginning, the president says: "The relations of the United States with ;iii foreign governments have con tinued on the normal bails of amity ;nid i;..nd understanding and are very generally satisfactory-" President Tafi says the Zeiaya rov erntnent of Nicaragua has kept Cen tral America in constant turmoil. "It Is unnecessary," he .says, "to rehearse i, i r the sad tale of unspeakable bar barities and oppression alleged to have b i n committed by the Kelayan govern ment, Execution of Americans "Recently two Americans were put to death by order of President SEelaya himself, They were reported t<> have i"•• n regularly commissioned officers in the organised forces of a revolution, and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized na tlons, they would be entitled to be dealt with us prisoners Of war." He continues: "This government proceeded with de liberate circumspection to determine the exact truth in relation to thece f purls and upon the course in the prem ises moil consistent with its dignity, its duty tn Ainerie.iti interests and its "inniai obligations i>> Central America and to civilisation." Concerning tin far east the president says this government preserves un cbanged its policy of supporting the open door and adds: "Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial an usual. The arrangement of lflos for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United states has proved to work satisfactorily." Reorganisation of the department of state up.in modem lines in further ance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad is recom mended. "Perhaps," continues the message, "tiii' most Important question presented to this administration is that of econ omy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. Nation's Finances "The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30. 1910, will exceed the receipts by $54,- 1 075,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama .anal, amounting to $38 000,000, and ! $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, 1 the deficit of ordinary receipts and ex penditures will be increased to a total defli II of 175,075,638. .This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the pro ceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this proposal.' 1 The president says the cost of en gineering and construction of the canal which will be completed January 1, 1!>15, will be $^97,766,000, Instead of 1119,705, --800, as originally estimated. Other ex penses Increase the cost by $75,435,000 to a total of $375,201,000. The president Is advised by the sec retary of the treasury that the esti mate of the expenses of the govern ment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911—that Is, for the next fiscal year —are less by $55,863,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fis cal year and adds: "So far as the secretary of the treas ury la able to form a Judgment as to future Income and compare It with the expenditure for the next fiscal yenr ending June 30, 1911, including the pay ments on account of the Panama canal and tho public debt, there will be no deficit In the year ending June 30, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. Needs Are Reduced "In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the government have been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption by con gress, so often made In times past, that estimates have been prepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result In aerlously ham pering proper administration." President Taft refers with regret to the sugar frauds recently discovered, saying the settlement made with the so-called "trust" will not interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who Is found to be subject to the same. He believes an Investi gation of the frauds by congress at present would be inadvisable, saying it might give Immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment in securing conviction of the guilty parties. President Taft then discusses the tariff and the operation of the maxi mum and minimum clause in the act. He says that in the working of this, fear has been expressed that the power conferred and duty Imposed upon the executive are likely to lead to a tariff war. "I be* to express the hope and be lief that no such result need be antici pated," Mr. Taft says.

I The new tariff board is dfscussod, the ! president laying that their work will perhaps take two or three years. A continuing annual appropriation Is aiked. Confidence in Work "I believe," the president continues, "that tnt) work Of tins boura Will be of prime utlity and Importance When- IVH congress slmll deem it wise again t«, adjust thu customs duties. If the tacts secured by the tariff board are of sucn a charactei ai to show generally that the rate! ot duties imposed by the 1 resent tariff law an SKi cssive under tlie principles of protection a- described in the platform ot the successful party at the late elei Uon, I Shall not hesitate to invite the attention or congress to tnis fact anil to the necessity for action predicated thereon, "Nothing, however, halts business .■■nd Interfere! with the course of pros perity so mm h a.s the threatened re vision of the tariff, and until the facts ar* at hand, alter careful and de llberate Investigation, upon which such revision can be properly undertaken, It seems to me unwise to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps Into arguments pro and con, In re i, tariff rates, is such as to require the kind of Investigation undertaken by it wholly without respect to the effect which the facts may have In calling for a readjustment of the rates of duty." A reduction in the estimates of the war department for the coming Bscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an amount $45,000,000 les.s than the corresponding estimates for last year, is mentioned by the president, all progress In military matters being suspended for a year as a consequence. These measures can hardly be more than temporary, the executive says. Later he will send a special message to congress upon military matters. Changes in Army Concurring in needed changes in the army, he places emphasis on the need for an elimination bill. "The coast de len.ses of the United States proper are generally all that could be desired, and in some respects they an rather more elaborate than under the present conditions are needed to stop an en- I my's fleet from entering the harbors defended." The president concurs in the Judg ment of the military and naval Joint board in favor of making an extensive i,aval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. The president then discusses the navy the need for reform, economy in ex penditures, etc. He says: "A* comprehensive plan for the re organization of the officers of all corpr i of the navy would be presented to con- i Cress and iiope it will meet wiUi action suited to its urgency." Appointment of an eminent astronomer as head of the naval observatory is recommended. President Taft says that in his judg ment a change in judicial procedure with a view to reducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the dispatch of business i and final decision in both civil and j criminal crises constitutes the greatest need In our American institutions. A commission to consider reforms In the judiciary is recommended, The president recommraends in compliance with the promise made In the Repub lican platform that. appropriate legis lation relating to the issuance of in junctions be adopted. Would Give Notice Previous notice and a reasonable op portunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined are urged by the president, with certain execptions. President Taft then refers to anti trust and interstate commerce laws, which will be discussed In a special message. ■ The president says the actual loss growing out of the transmission of second-class mail matter amounts to about $63,000,000 a year. Congress, he says, may well consider whether rad ical steps should not be taken to re duce the deficit by Imposing a higher rate of postage on magazines and pe riodicals. President Taft says he Is convinced the people desire postal savings banks and that they will be productive of the utmost good. He says of them: "They will furnish a satisfactory substitute for the system of a govern ment guaranty of deposits, which, with deference to those who advocate It, seems to me to have in it the seeds of demoralization to conservative banking and certain financial dis aster." The president earnestly recommend- I ed the passage of a ship subsidy bill. In recommending separate statehood for New Mexico and Arizona President Taft advises that after {he adoption of a constitution it be submitted to the people for approval. State officers should not be elected until after the ■stitutlon has been settled upon. Alaskan Legislation "With respect to Alaska," said the president, "I recommend legislation which shall provide for the apointment by the president of a governor and also of an executive council, the mem bers of which shall, during their term of office, reside in the territory, and which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable it to give the ter ritory local laws adapted to its pres- f I — _.

The president mentions the necessity tor legislation looking to the further conservation of natural resources and announces that a special message on this subject, Including thai of water- I ways, reclamation, Irrigation, refor esting, etc., will be sent to congress early. Transfer of control over the light houses to a suitable civilian bureau Is recommended because of frequent fric tion due to the absence of any central independent authority. White slavery is discussed, the view being that there is urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater ex ecutive activity to suppress It. "I believe it to be constitutional," the president says, "to forbid under pen alty the transportation of persons for purposes of prostitution across national and state lines, and by appropriating a fund of $50,000 to be used by the sec retary of commerce and labor for the employment of special Inspectors it will be possible to bring those respon sible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a federal law." To Unite Departments The president says that while the medical departments of the army and navy must be kept separate there seems no reason why all the other bureaus and offices in the general government which have to do with the public health should not be united in a bureau to be called the "bureau of public health." "In conclusion the president says: "Speaking generally, the country la in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business ex pansion and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market value of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring mean gieat prosperity for the farming community, but on the other hand they mean a very considerably increased burden upon those classes in the com munity whose yearly compensation does not expand with the improvement In the business and the general pros perity. Various reasons are given for the high prices. "The proportionate increaso in the output of gold, which today Is the chief medium of exchange and is in some re spects a measure of values, furnishing a substantial explanation of at U-ast part of the increase in prices.
