Tho Tribune's Paris correspondent cobles to that paper a Toport giving tho views ot Mr. Ulalnoon tbo President's mossago. Mr. Blalno said to tho ft ibtme representative: "Ihavobeon reading an abstract ot tho President's rncs- tito and bavo been especially Interested In tbo comments ot tbo London papers. Thoso papers all assumo to dcclaro tbo message Is a freo trado manifesto, and evidently are anticipating a largo market for English fabrics In tbo United States as a conse quence of tbo President's recommendation. Perhaps tbat fact stamped tho character ot tbo mossago moro clearly than any words of mlnecan." "You don't mean actual freo trado with out duty?" queried the reporter. .no," rcpiieu nt. maino.

"I don't know that I qulto comprehend that last point," said the reporter. "I mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that for tho first time In tbo hlatory ot tho United States tbo President rccommonds retain, lug the Internal tax la order that tho tariff may bo forced down ovon below tho fair revenuo standard. Ho recommends that tbo tax on tobacco bo retained, and thus tbat many millions annually shall be levied en a domestic product which would far better com from a tariff on foreign fabrics." Mr. Ulaloo favors tbo repeal ot tho to bacco tax. tie aatd : "I should urge that It bo xloiio at once, even boforo tho Christmas holidays. It would, In tho flrtt place, bring great relief to growers of tobacco ull over tho couotry, and would, moreover, materially lessen the price of tho article to consumers. Tobacco to millions ot men la a necessity. Tho President calls It a luxury, but It Is a luxury In no other sense tnan tea nnacouco aro luxuries, too only excuse for such a tax Is tbo actual necessity unuor wnicn . mo govern ment found Itself during the war, and the 'years Immediately following. To retain the tax now In order to destroy tho protection which would Incidentally flow from railing tho eimo amount of money on foreign Imports Is certainly a most ex traordinary policy for our government." "Well, then, Mr. Blslnn, would you ad vise mo repeal 01 mo wuisuy tax aiaor "No, I would not.

I would use tho tax to fortlfv our cities on tbo seaboard. In view of tho powerful letter addressed to the Democratic party on tbe subject ot fortification by tho late Samuel J. Tilden In 1883, 1 am amazed tbat no attention has been paid to tbo subect by tho Democratic administration. Nover before In tbe history of the world baa any government allowed groat cities on tbe sea- ooara, into rniiaacipnia, now tone, uoston, llaltlmorc, New Orleans, and San Francisco to remain defenseless." "But." said the reporter, "von don't think we are to bavo war In any direction t" "Certainly not," said .Mr. Blalnoi neither.

If ultimately relict ould be riven In tbat direction It would. n my Judgment, bo a wlso and beneficent oncy." Concerning protection to wool growers, Ir. Blaine said: "I should seriously obleet 0 the repeal of tho duty on wool. To re- eai tnai wouiu worn great injustice 10 jany Interests and would seriously dls ourago what wo should encourage, namely, bo sheep culturo among farmers througho ut tbe Union. To break down wool grow ig and bo dependent on foreign countries or the blanket under which we sleep and bo coat tbat covers our backs Is not a wise ollcy for tho national government to en jrco." Ibe question of labor, Mr. Blalno do larcd, undcrlled tho whole subject. The Interview, which Is of considerable cngth, gives a lucid statement of Mr, Halne's views on the tariff of 1840 and Its esults. Mr. Blaine holds tbat "tariff did ot Involve Ino one distinctive point roc mmended by the Prcsidont, namely, bo retaining ot direct Internal taxos order to aimlli'i luuircct taxes ioviou on nolgn fabrics.

Tbo wholo amount ot our export and Import trade together has never, I think, roachod $1,900,000,000 any one year. Our Internal homo trado on 130,000 rallos of railway, along 19,000 miles ot ocoau coast, over tbo five great lakes, and along; 20,000 miles ot navlgablo rivers, reaches tho enormous an nual aggregate of moro than forty billions, and perhaps this year fifty billions of dol lar.

Tho magnltudo of the Union and the Immensity of Its Internal trado require a new political economy. Tho treaties written for European states do not grasp our peculiar situation." To the question concerning tho effect ot tbo President's messago in tbo south, Mr. Blaine said 1 " I don't care to answer thst question. Tho truth has been so long ob scured by certain local questions ot unrea soning prejudico that nobody can hope for an industrial enlightenment among tbelr leaders Just yet. Bat in my view the south, above all sections ot the Union, needs a protective tariff.

UULOAIUA. The Real Object of Massing Troops on Austria's Frontier London, Deo. 7. Tho complications which bavo arisen between Austria and Russia ate becoming moro' and moro dlfll cult of solution and are undoubtedly tho outcome ot tbo recent Interview In Berlin between 1'rlnco Bismarck and tbo czar. Notwithstanding tho assertions ot tho Gcr man press tbat nono of tho publications purporting to state tho substaucoot tbat Intervlewjs correct In a slnglo particular, suspicion has arisen from tho tenor ot tho recent official correspondence by mall and by telegraph from tho informa tion obtained by several reliable corre spondents and from tbe tono ot tbo various continental bourses that the czar quitted tbe German capital In a towering rago, fomented by tbo aggressiveness ot the Iron chancellor. A correspondent gives tho fol lowing version ot what occurred between Bismarck and tbo Imperial visitor, which Is believed. In view ot subsequent events, to bo substantially correct: Tbo czir demanded tho abrogation of the new triple nlllanco be tween Germany, Austria, and Italy, accom panjlng bis demand with an outspoken de nunciation ot the compact as being not only an exhibition ot bad faith, but ot posi tive menace to Itussla. Prlnco Bismarck flatly refused to rupturo tho now agree ment, and'the czar wlthdrow. Russia now hopes to crush Bulgaria, nnd will attempt It bv force ot arms If diplomacy or menaco falls, and this is hor solo object In massing troops on Gsllca, a move ment which was suddenly and vastly ac celerated Immediately after the czar's re turn to Gatschlm. A great deal ot Interest Is centered upon tho result of to-morrow's Imperial and military cooference at Vienna, which will definitely dccldo Austria's po sition, but srogle-handed Austria would bavo no better chance of success against Russia than abo had In her inotnorablo at tempt to chastlto Prussia. Prcsidont Carnot still delays tho forma tion of a new French ministry until tho re publican factions reach a moro dollnlto agreement. Ho Is determined that they shall concontrato their strength, and ultf nrately they will do so. It seems scarcoly possible that they will fall ot this In vlow ot tbe pledges already mado by several ot tbe group presidents, and tbo establishment of a cabinet Is believed to bo only a ques tion ot a few days. Judge Ilolmca,-. ot tho Irish court ot queen's bench, bas granted n conditional order totting aside Mr. Sexton's election and qualifying acts to the ofllco of lord mayor of Dublin, end tbo matter of that gentleman's taking his sent depends en tirely upon tho ultimate decision ot tbo couttwhen the order Is returned andar- ued. Tbo grounds for dobarrlne Mr. exton aro that bo bas violated tbe crimes act. and that in his capacity as hlirh sheriff neglected or refused to perform all ot tho functions attaching to his ofllco. Tbo Si. James Gazette supplement has a highly sensational article to-day on the discovery of gold In Wales, with an edi torial note stating that tho paper Itself ac cepts tbe story cum grano sails.

HU83IAN TliOOPS OS THE FiiONnnn, Berlin, Dec. 7. Tho National (la.iettc says It Is evident the number ot troops on the Austrian frontier Is not sufficient to attack two formidable military powers. Ibe present massing la too small for war and too large for peace. Tbe Moscow Oaxette says tbo futuro of Franco will doclde whether Germany must watth one or both frontiers. , , It Is Sf mt-oluclally denied that tho powers have officially Interested tbemtelves In tho Increase of Ilusslau troops on the Austrian frontier. Austtla will reorganize, and in. crcaso her frontier guard. Tbe fia((adonls that change of treat ment baa Improved tb crown prince's con dition, but says tbe swelling of tbe glands which disappeared was due to tbo teeth trouble Germany and Austria will unite In case cither power goes to war with Russia. In tbat cose Rusalan Poland will be occupied to facilitate mobilization. To offset tho danger Itussla hns increased her forces on tne irontier, it is rcganitu as a purely de fensive move.

8ECUKK THE HI l'OUTAXT CIIAIKSIANSIIirS. Somo Sonntors Dlssnttalled With Tholr Assignment Speaker Onrllsle Some what Ilottiered Congressman Soott for Ilend of tho Ways and Moans Committee. Thomakoupot the Senate committees may possibly be made pnbllc to-day, but li Is more probablo tbat tbo announcement will bo postponed until Monday, Tho do lay la duo, It Is said, to tho ambition ot cer tain senators who deslro chairmanships other than the ones which aro properly theirs. It ts almost certain that Senator Black burn will rctlro from service on tbo District commlttco ashishomo interests reqnlro all his lime. Tho chairmanship of Iho naval committee, in tbo regular succession, will go to Senator Cameron, hut eomo of Senator CbaDdler's friends think bo should bo placed at tbo holm of naval affairs, and tbore Is a proba bility that Senator Cameron may mako way for the senator from New Hamnsblro. Rumor has It that Senator Stanford will bo chairman ot tho committee on public buildings and grounds, and that postoOlces and postroads will bo cared for by Senator Bawyer. Senator Ulscock jrlll, it Is said, succeed Senator Fryo 00 tho committee on rules, and there Booms to be no doubt as to Senator Hawley's securing the military committee Senator Fryo will undoubtedly move up to tho head of tbo commlttoeon commerce Tbe committee on the Judiciary, to which will bo referred tho nomination of Mr. Lamar, will bo composed ns follows! Messrs. Edmunds (chairman), Evarts, Hoar, Ingalls, Wilson, of Iowa, and Toller, Republicans; and Messrs. George, Coko, Vest, and Pugb, Democrats. Although tbu Uouso was not In scsiton yesterday, a number of members wcro In their seats attending to their correspond ence and chatting with ono nnothrr over tho committeeships. Speaker Carlisle spent several hours In ills room hi an ef fort to outline tho organization of the com mittees. He has had prepared a number ot cards bearing tbo names of tho different members which ho Is endeavoring to assort Into committees. Theso cards can be readily transferred from one commlttco set to another, so that changes are mado with facility. During tho day all of tho represen tatives who visited tho capital callod upon tbo Speaker, cither by request or of their own volition, to express their personal pref erence In the assignments to committees. Many rumors wcro current this afternoon relative to tho distribution ot tho chairman ships. Little credence Is generally given to them, however, owing to tho fact that many changes In tbo list are Inevitable even alter It shall have been advanced much noarcr to oomplotlon tbat It Is presumed to bo at present. Ibe appolntmont of tho committee on ruler, which will probably bo mado In a day or two, la awaited with special interest, for tho reason that the chairman ot tho committee on ways and means bas always been a member of tho commlttco on rules, and tbe arrangement ot Mr. Morrison's suc cessor on tbe last named commlttco will bo generally regarded as tantamount to tho selection ot the chairman ot tho commlttco on ways and means. Tboeo who aro familiar with tho commit tees, and who know tho Speaker's prefer ences, have made the following elate and are willing to gamblo on Us correctness : Elections, Tnrner, of Georgia; appropria tions, Randall, of Pennsylvania; Bland, of Missouri, coinage, welgnts, and meas ures; Judiciary, Culberson, ot Texas; rivers and harbors, Blanchard. ot Louisiana; territories, Sprloger, of Illinois: agricul ture, Hatch, of Missouri; postoOlces ami postroads, Blount, ot Georgia: naval af fairs, Herbert, of Alabama; militia, Forney, of Alabama. Mr. Belmont, of New York, Is almost cer tain to retain his position at the head of tbo commltteo on foreign affairs, although there Is a disposition to press Mr. S. 6. Cox for tho placo. Mr. Cox had humorously expressed a preferenco for the chairman ship ot tbe committee ot tbe wholo, but as a stern fact bo will almost surely ornament tho library committee and the commlttco on tne eieventn census. This city will not suffer no matter which of tbo two gentlemen named for tbo chair manship of the District commltteo aro ap pointed. Either Mr. Hemphill, ot South Carollua, or Mr. Barnos Compton, ot Mary land, would watch closely over tho In terests of tbe moro than 200,000 people who have no voice of tbelr own. Tho friends of Mr. C. W. P Breckinridge, of Kentucky, bavo talked qulto confidently of bis securing the chairmanship of tho ways and means committee, hut tbo Ken tucklan's chances have, eo Uamo Rumor says, received a black eye, for tbo gossips bad a story last night, that seemed to be well founded, tbat Mr. V. L, Scott, of Pennsyl vania, a well known tariff reformer, would take charge ot the big committee and would run It In tho Interest ot tbo President's views. Tbo southern members say It would be manifestly unfair to glvo Pennsylvania tho two most Important committees, and any suggestion of Mr. Scott's appointment meets with decided disapprobation. Tbe commlttco on ventilation and acous tics has been awarded bv tho press gallery to "Major" Martin, ot Texas. This la an unti6ual corapllmont to a member In bls.Qrst term, and tho honorable gentleman's friends aro qulto proud of tbe distinction conferred on him. It Is very probablo that during the winter Congress will bo called nnon to Investlcrata tbo eras company. In nhich ovent tbo Speaker will, without doubt, appoint tho "major" chairman of tbo select committee, his expert knowlodge of that watery Illuminator bdug.t full and sufficient recommendation for tbo position, COXGllEsSIONAL- l'ROCEEDINGS. Only a Short Session of tho Senate Held. Thero'waa but a short session of tho Son ato yesterday, and tho llttlo business that ' was transacted was ot tho briefest descrip tion. A letter from the Secretary of tho Inte rior was laid beforo tho Senate, statlnz that an appropriation of $77,405 Is required tocompleto the publication ot the final report on tbo census ot 1ES0 four ot tho twenty-two volumes being still unprlntod. Laid on tbe table.4 After tbo presentation ot various other communications from heads ot departments and tho court ot claims, Mr. Cullom re marked that tbe rulo wus when bills aro Introduced beforo committees aro ap pointed to have such bills laid on tho tablo, and tbat that created unnecessary work. He therefore moved that tho Senate ad journ. But be wlthdrow the molluu tem porarily to permit Mr. Plumb to offer a resolution calling 011 tho commissioner of agriculture for Information as to whether any person In tho employment of that de partment making experiments as to tbo manufacture of sugar from sorghum had obtained or applied for a patent or patents connected wun sucu manuiacture anu growing out of such experiment. The resolution was adopted. Mr. Farwell aek6d his colleaguo to with draw hie motion so, as to allow him to In troduce a bill to perpetuate tho national bank system. Mr. Cullom declined, stating that bo made the motion because bo understood It to bo tbe custom of theSonate not to re ceive bills until after tbo appointment ot committees. Mr. Harris thought there was groat wis dom In the position taken by tho senator (Mr. Cullom). If tbe door were thrown open he would Insist tbat tbere ahouM be no restrictions on tbe right, no hoped the motion would prevail ...

Strong l'rolcst Against President Clove, land's llecointnendatlon. Tho conferenco ot wool growors and wool dealers of tho United States, held yestorday atthoEbbltt House, resulted In tho adoption, unanimously, ot tho following strong pro test against that portion ot tbe President's messago In regard to abolition of tho wool taxi The wool dealers and wool growors of tun United States, representing a capital ot over five hundred millions of dollars, and a constituency of a million wool growors aud wool dealers, assembled In conference In tbo city ot Washington, the flh day ot De cember, 1837, having road tbo first annuil mestsgo of tho President to the flttloth Congress, dcclaro tbat the sentiments ot the messago aro a direct attack upon tbelr In dustry, ono of tho most Important of tbo country, and In posltlvo violation ot tho national Democratla platform of 1881, as Interpreted by tbe party leaders and ac ccpttd by tbo rank and file ot tbo party; tbat Ibe argument mado by tbo President for tho removal ot our protection agttait foreign competition Is the old ono repeat edly mado by tho enemies of our Industrial progress, and effectively answered In nearly every school district ot our land, aud so thoroughly approved by the logic ot facts and demonstration ot exp?rlonco and his tory as to need no answer from us. Wo acknowledge that our "small holdings," ouncattorxd aud unorganized condition, makes us the easy prey ot tbo free trader, but wo bad a right tn exprct something dif ferent from thoCblet Eiecullvo ot the nation, at onco tho most hannv. tiroioerous. snd contented ot any ot tho world, mado so by a policy of protection and develop ment which bo now seeks to destroy. Wo had a right to expect our President would favor tbo wool growers ot the United Slates, nnd confpss our deep disappoint ment that Instead be favored tho Interests ot our ton Ign competitors. Justly alarmed at his imltlon, wu nuke an appeal from his rccmim.mUllons to tho people to all tbo people, to ths Soveti and ibrct-fourlhs millions ot our felloc-cttlzens engaged In agriculture, to tbe millions on goged In manufacturing, to the army of wago carnois whoso wags aro maintained uy too protect! vo system, to mo trauesmen and mcrcbanta nbofo prosperity depends upon ours, confident that tbe Judgmontand decision will bo based upon Justice aud patriotism, and, therefore, for tho mainte nance of tbo American policy ot protection, to which tbe couutry Is Indebted for Its un exampled development and prosperity. To demonstrate tbo Injustice of tho Presi dent's policy, and tho fallacy of the remedy Lo propoecsfor tho reduction of tho surplus, wo point to tbo fact that It tho wholo amount of tbo revonue derived from wool was abolished It would rcduco tbo surplus only about $.1,000,000, or less than 10 cents Eer capita of tho population, which Is paid y foreigners, whllo tbo old war taxes ho recommends retained yield over $110,000, 000. and ts a direct tax per capita ot $3 eocu, anu is wnat mattes up mo great mug of tbo surplus of $140,000,000, and which fosters a most dangerous monopoly. Wo would further add the following sta tistics In regard to the wool Industry: Tho annual icvenuo dorlvcd from imports ot wool under tho tariff ot 1607 was loss than $1,700,000. Under tbo roduced tariff or 18S3 tho revenuo last year was over $5,000, 0C0. Tho number of sheep In tho country lu 1S84 was S0,G20,C2d, and In 1887 44,750, 314, a decicase of noarly 0,000,000, and a dlmunltlon of the annual wool product ot over 85,000,000 pounds, thus showing that reducing tbo tariff by tbo act ot 1S3U has increased tho revenue from imported wools and dimlnrsucd mo numoer ot snecp in tuo United States about 13 per cont. and tho annual product about tbe same proportion. Thol President's policy would bring about tho destruction ot this Industry, and tho same policy of reduction or abolition ot the tariff would end tn disaster to all tbo other Industrial productive enterprises of the couatry. 

DISSECTING THE MESSAGE. It Mnlie the Very Inauo the Itepubll enn Party Uetlrcri. Mr. Rccd, of Maine, said, letcrrlng to the President's message: "l'he messago was certainly a surprising one, but It Is not sur pilslcg becouso thoro Is anything now In It. No one familiar with tbu monotonous misstatements of tho f tee trade argument needed moro than a word hero and thcro to feel that the administration ludgonoovor to tbo Carlisle wlug with no dlsgulso what ever. It II1 bo Imposslblo tor tbo Demo cratic party hereafter to deny Its complicity in the attack nu American Industries without dlsownlrg tho administration. Tbe attempt ut tbo cioso of the long ar gument In Nvor of freo trade to dcclaro tho freo trade quostton irrelevant would bo n broad Jest It It wcro not inn stato paper. To glvu fuller power to his declarations tho Presldout his omitted all reference to other things, remitting all tho manifold concerns of the government to a message to bo glveu In tho future perhaps. To mako suro that tho whole blow shall stilko full nnd fair at American lodustilos ho lauds tho internal revenuo without ex ception. No mention Is mado of sugar; no mention Is mado ot tobacco; not a word of alcohol used In the arts; no free raw material when produced lu this country; only freo raw material whan produced abroad. Surely tbo message Is a surpris ing ono. But It makes tho very Issue wo bavo desired." Judgo Perkins, ot Kansas, on being asked what bo thought of tbo President's messugo, said it was remarkablo In moro particulars than ono. 'iho Prcsidont hud submitted ovcry question ot Importanco to tho coun try, with ono elude oxcoptlon, to Congress without comment and upon the reports ot his subordinate officers; and ho thinks It ho had submitted tho tarlft questlou upon Mr. Carlisle's speech when elected Speaker It would bavo been better for tho Democracy. Ho (ays tbo President's general platitudes aro not as ornato as Mr. Carlisle's, nnd that Mr. Carlisle did not commit tbe mistake of arguing or discussing tbo benefits resulting to tbo country from tho system of protec tion, and hence did not exhlbl ttbe wonderful Ignorance shuwn by tho Prcsidont In the ele mentary principles of our American sys tem. "The President," said he, "spoaks of 'raw matorlal,' and Indirectly recom mends that all duty he removed from such.

CLAIMS Ol' MINNHAl'OfilS. Argument!! far Holding tho Conven tion In tho City ot Flour Mills, Tho great northwest Is a candidate tor tho national convention, and tho pride of Mlnnosota, Minneapolis on tho Falls ot St. Anthony, Is pushing her claims vigorously, bacltod by tho great territories west ot tho greatest flour producing state ot tho Union. The commltteo representing Minneapolis Is armed with a startling array of facts, figures, Aiid fnoclca to hurl at tho commit te this morning In suppott of tholr claims that their city is tbo most doslrablo spot on earth In which to nominate tho next Prcsidont of tho United States. Ever Jealous ot Chicago a tabulated statement Is given showing that of tho seven Republican conventions held sinco 18C0 Chicago has bcon accorded tho honor four times. Its flouring Industry Is referred to, and figures given to show that It Is the greatest city for tbat staple In the world, and Its mills tho largest and best equipped. Tho exact bearing of a flour mill with Its ponderous machinery on tho nomination of a Republican presidential candidate must be inferred. In tho matter ot railroads Minneapolis Is admirably equipped, as tbo statement shows no less than IS railroads centering there; Its accessibility demonstrate! by tho fact that It ts but 37 hours from Washington, 14 from Chicago, 03 from New York, 130 from San Francisco, and S3 from New Orleans. A douhlo column array of hotels giving ficeommOiUtlons for 3,300 persons, when tho resources of St. Paul and Lsko Mlnnotonk are pressed Into requisition, Is also prominently presented, whllo tho dccldidty consoling attraction of boarding hnu.es for the ac commodation of nbcut 10,000 additional strangers Is hild out as a paramount In ducement for lurlog delegates who will nomluato tho next President ot tho Unltod States, with tbelr -frlecds, and others who find an Interest In the mcollngof this great body. A startling and stttuitng array of conven tions already hold In the city is given to show that Minneapolis can satisfactorily handlo largo bodies. In about every other lino tbo Incomparable charm ot tho finest climate on God's green footstool Is elabo rately set forth. As tor a hall well, thcro Isn't but ono ball In tho United Sta os capable of accom modating a national convention. That bell Is tbo exposition building In Mlnnoapo II?, which will hold 30,000 persons, and Its acoustic properties are so perfect a whisper uttered la this hall Is heard with all tho tones of adlcchargoof heavily rolling artil lery tn tho 7cnlth city of tbo nnsaltcd seas. Minneapolis has another characteristic generosity. If tbo convention will go to that city tho residents thereof wilt spend $40,000 to entertain them, board and wish ing ot delegates not Included. Tho fact that Dakota, ft great Republi can territory, adjoins Minnesota on tho west, Is glowingly present.! as another Induce ment for holding tbo convention there.

But It Is not so tar west now as Chicago was lu 1SO0, when tho first repub lican convention was held there lu a wig wam, and that turned out to bo a pretty good convention." "But Omaha Is not eo large a city at Chicago." "Noteo largo a city as Chicago Is now, but Just about tho size that Chicago was when (bo got her first Itepubllcan conven tion." "How largo Is that"' "Well, Omaha has a population ot 110,000, I should say." "By what census t" "Well, now, young man, I am not quot ing figures from tho cyclopedia that Mr. Cleveland Is reported to have travclel with. We can't print statistics fast enough to keep up with western growth. By tho state census of 1SSS Omaha bad 02,000 pop ulation, and she now adds about 23,0) people each year." "Then you think, governor, that Omaha can take care of a national convention 7 " "Why, to bo euro, Omaha can do so, and do It right royally, too." "How many people would you bo pre pared for?" "Wo should expect to entertain about 80,000 a day on an average." "Vou bavo not hotol accommodations tor such a crowd?" "No city bas. Extra accommodations must bo provided, or ought to be supplied wherever tbo convention Is located." "Can thst bo dono in Omaha!" "Not only can bo but will bs If Oji ih 1 Is selected." ."Building takes tlmo." "Yes, In tbo cast, but Omaha Is accustomed to wonders. Why, what would staid oid Washington think of thU: On the lO'.u ot last September tbo Ooiaha Stockyards Com pany let the contract for tho erection of a great bog packing house for Phil. Armiur, tho millionaire packer. Tbo buildlog, or rather the series of buildings, cost a quarter ot u million dollars.

Already ovtr ("10,000 bogs have been killed and packed lu that establishment, hlch cost a quarter ot a million and which was not begun ninety days ago. Now, what do you think of tbatl" "Were tho buildings of frame construc tion " 'No, Indeed; they aro of brick, and tho workmen wore paid high wages and worke 1 like a swarm ot bees, Sundays as well as week duys." "What Is tbo present hotel capacity ot Omaha f " "I understand from tho secretary ot our commltteo, who made an Investigation, that It Is about 8,000." "Omaha Is tho city that Saxo wrote of In poetry, governor, as having very muddy streets, II I remember I" "Yes, Saxo said; "Hast ever been In Omaha, W hero rolls tbo dark Missouri don 11, And four ttrong bones scan 0 can draw An empty wagon through tho town' "Tbat was truo once, but It has all bsen changed. Omaha Is now tho best paved city In tbo west. It has twenty-It vo miles ot paved streets like theso here In Washing ton." "I don't seo where Omaha gets Its wealth." "Makes it, young man, makes It by cu ergy.plutk, and through natural advautigea, Omaha has put eight million dollars Into new bulldlncs this year." "What kind of buildings!" "All kinds. Three new bank buildings alone, each six stories high, cost JjOO.OOJ, and are Just now being finished." "Has Omaha such wealthy banks?" "To bo sure sba bxs. She must have to do her business. There Is an average btl once of about $15,000,000 constantly on de posit In tbo banks of Omaha, and nine of tbira are national banks." "I hardly see why Omaha should have a business ot such magnltudo?" "Becauso she Is the metropolis ot a tract of country having about two million and a half population. With this couatry her wholi sale trade this j ear will reach seventy five million dollars, an lncreaso ot eighteen million dollars over last year." "Are railroad facilities good?" "Excellent. There are some thirteen rail roads centering at Omaha, and live of theso run to Chicago. Tho others go north to St. Paul and Minneapolis, south to Galves ton and Kansas City, southeast tSt. Louis and Cincinnati, and west to Dteer and California. You see wo arc about In tho center of the continent." "Omaha Is not a very rough place?" "Not by any means, Omaha has sixty seven churches, S.000 children In public schools, on which the city expends about $400,000 a year, and several fine open houses and theaters." "Do you expect to get the convention, governor?" "Wo bopo to, 6lr, wo hope to succeed. The gentlemen from the other cities all ex press a kindly feeling towards the west, aud, towards Omaha In particular, and I ant sure no ono Is flcbtlug us excopt in a ftlcpdly rivalry. You see wo expect to bavo a great many people come out to soo us as a result ot the showing which webavo mado whether we get tbe convention oc not." "How about tbo national Democratic con vention t" "Well, young man, I am a Keoubllcao, but I should not bo surprised If tbe Oemo cratlo committee would locate that in Omaha when its mombors learn what I know tbat Mrs. Cleveland owns an eighth Interest In tbo Falsom estato, consisting o lots In Omaba now worth a million and at half, but which cost Mrs. Cleveland's uacla less than $1,000."
