Every person over the age of 16 years who draws a salary is required to pay so mucb of bis earnings to the gov ernment in the nature of an assessment. 5W"hen old age creeps on the per«on so Insured has a small competence to leave -those who are dependent on them. The "Western Editor is the title of a magazine that has been coming to THE ^REPUBLICAN for several months, and jwe have read it with a great deal of in terest from the fact that it contains some very excellent suggestions and ideas pertaining to tie printing and newspaper business. The magazine is ^published at Omaha and has grown '^wonderfully in the number of pages ^printed now and a year ago. Success to the Editor, and may it continue to do sthe good that it set out to do. Senators McLaurin and Tillman, of South Carolina, are again in trouble and in the senate a few days ago they had quite an animated debate over the Statement of McLaurin that an effort was being made by the democrats to •keep him off the important committees -and thus bring discredit to him and "work his state an injury. Tillman de ified McLaurin to resign their seats in the senate and return home to "wash their dirty linen.."' There is an old feud existing between the two senators as to which is the regular democrat, but McLaurin claims the people have endorsed him, but the leaders of the party are endeavoring to annihilate and humiliate him in the eyes of'his constituents. Senator Mark Hanna was quite well pleased with President Roosevelt's message. He is quoted as follows in reference to the message: "Yes, I like the mesjage. I told Mr. Roosevelt so. ,1 think it has made a very good im pression all over the country. It cer tainly pleased nearly everybody I have talked to. You see, we expect tome thing different from Roosevelt than what we would expect from any other president. That is because be is Mr. Roosevelt. There is nobody else like him. It was a candid message. The president said just what he meant, and I must say that I found the philosophy highly edifying. You know a little philosophy now and then is a good thing for everybody. The Boers have some strong sympa thizers in Illinois and Chicago. It was only a few days ago that Gov. Yates of that state issued a proclamation asking the people to contribute money toward the suffering sick women and children in South Africa. Sunday night a pub lic meeting was held in Chicago and was addressed by Bourke Cochran, of New York, urging Americans to use their influence to stop the war. He declared that the Boers had won their freedom and were entitled to maintain it. Meetings of this character will have a big influence in spreading over the country, and it is possible that the Boers may get a.great deal of assist ance coveted from this country, though it will hardly receive the sanction of the Washington authorities. On retiring from the command of the Tammany forces Richard Croker re lieved himself in the following manner in speaking of *,he arduous duties of looking continually after the affairs of thit big organization: '"This role of leader isn't abed of roses. It is too much for me. No man can stand it as long as I have. I must have rest. It has been all work and no pleasure with me. If a man becomes leader of Tam many Hall he might as well give up the idea for all time of having fun. If the people know wha'. I have undergone as the leader of Tammany Hall they would not blame me for wanting rest in England once in awhile. There is no rest for me in New York or any place in this country. If I go to New Jersey, New England or to California the pap ers instruct their representatives to camp around the house in which I am staying. I tell you it is a trying job. It is nice for the rr en who have nothing to do but to look after the fat offices and hold them down. It is the man who has to handle all the troubles of the organization who gets no sleep. There is no end of work in it, and no one man is going to stand it long." 

WHAT THE SENATOR'S DOING. Mr. Pettigrew Devoting His Time to .Making1 Money Now and May Return to Politics Later. Ex senator Pettigrew bas dropped out of touch with tbe public recent and it is not very oftsn ihu anything it h'iard of him, but the senator, since bis defeat in this state, has not been idle and he has Ret to work to recoup bis fallen fortune?. The following inter view at DusMoiae--, Iowa., last, week with his brother will show what the senator is doing at present: 'Senator Pettigrew and Charl-j.v T'.wn5 art-T ving-in New r^ now," If The Bittera trill cur* Drtrajxu, UdlfMtlM.

"They have rented tne magnificent home of the New York tax commission on Fifty-aeoond streat, near Central Park, and will reside ihere during the winter, My brother Frank is manage ing a big gold mining company, and Mr. Toirne is a director and attorney for the Beaumount, Tex., Oil company, at a salary of $lu,000 a year. Both say they have dropped polities, ana for a few years at least wllldevoie their energies to aocumulating a competence' "At present the ex-senator is in Ari zona looking after some mining lands he has there" continued Mr. Pettigrew, "but the biggest property In which he is interested is in California. The com pany has a mine there similiar to the Homestake property in the Black Hills. It is a mountain of low grade ore and practically in exhaustible. The only question is as to how oheaply the ore can be mined. Preparations are being made for tbe laying of tracks, the con struction of smellers and apparatus for mining on a huge scale. It is ex pected that within six months the company will be reducing at least 15,000 tons of ore our day. The ex-senator is doing well and will be rich some day He was always a hustler, and when he quit working for the dear people and started out for himself 1 knew that he would have thinge started his way with in a short time. "No he didn't make a million on the Wall street deal," continued the speak er. "I know that sort of a yarn was spread over the country everywhere. He did, however, make what might be termed a 'killing,' but he only cleaned up enough to square his indebtedness and start him on the road to fortune. But he hasn't any reason to complain, and within a few years he will be well off. Just how much he mad6 I decline to state, but it *am't a million." "Will Senator Pettigrew enter poli tics again?" was asked. "Well, you'll have to ask him. But as he re'ains his residence in Sioux Falls it isn't unlikely that he will stir the animals up in good shape within a few years. He says be has dropped pol itics,but I've heard him eay that be fore. Fact is, be couldn't keep out of the game if he wanted. He's got, like other men who have been defeated, friends to reward and enemies to pun ish, and you know a politician can't jar loose under suoh circumstances." For Over Fifty Years. AN OLD AND

Red field Press: If a game (foot ball) could be arranged between Vermillion and Mitchell it. would be worth going a long way to see. It would be a game for blood from the start. For some rea son Vermillion holds Mitchell responsi ble for the action of the board of col lege athletics in barring Vermillion from contests on account of profession alism. It may be that Mitchell was very active in prosecuting tbe charges and It may be that Mitchell wa3 tbe gainer by the decision of tbe board but it was the action of the properly con stituted judges after due consideration an^ Vermillion has no good reason to hold a grudge against any one college, in fact there is no reason to be mad at all. Vermillion had men in her teams in the contests that should not have been there and in the contest of pure sport they should have baen as glad to have them bounced as any of the teams. If tbe colleges expect the peop to sympathize with them and help them in their sports they must be conducted in an honest and fair manner. We thought Vermillion would get over her mad in a little while but it seems she did not. The students of Vermillion should re member though they aro in a state in stitution they bave no right to keep the institution out of the contests in the state for a little mutter of spite. They have no real grievances. They have no cause at all. If a wrong was done them five or six years ago they have wronged the state every year sicc. If thsy ex pect any sympathy in the future they must quit this toolisb, baby play at.d get into the game-* next year like men. TO IMPLEMENT DEALERS. President Colvin Delivers Splendid Address Before Them at Sioux Falls Tuesday. «.jt The retail implement dealers are In session at Sioux Falls in annual con vention. The Sioux Falls Press pre sents the following as apart of tha ad dress of President John Colvin is tbe members of the association: "We have demonstrated in seme small degree that we did not esociate ourselves together for the purpose of endeavoring to force the manufactur ers to do business in the way we dic tate or in any way strive to coerce them in the matter ef prices, but our earnest eedeavor is to cultivate a reciprocal feeling between the manufacturer and dealer and to strive by moral suasion to do away with any discrimination against any locality or person, and to strlye by concerted effort to bring the manufacturers goods to the consumer at the least possible price. We find a feeling among our customers that we area trust, and some of the dealers have been unfair and unkind enough to try to make the customers believe that this was the purpose for which the as sociation was formed but we have to some extent disabused the minds of our customers of this false idea. "The middlemen deserves widespread recognition as a public benefactor. Through him inventive genius has found its outlet and its application.

Besides adding to hit own fame, the middleman has increased the productiveness of tbe earth.

Certainly he who has made two or three or a score of blades of grass grow where one formerly sprung up, ought to share in the blessings which come to greatful prospsrity.

An attorney of this city recently went to the trouble of compiling a list of the companies which have been incorporated under the laws of South Dakota and yesterday showed it to be a reporter. From the list it appears that over 500 companies have been incomporated in the firBt 10 months of this present year, all having a capital of over $100,000, and ranging to one with a capitalization of 925,000,000. The gross amount of the capitalization of all these companies -it $1,828,175,900, and in addition there were smaller companies having a total capitalization of $10,000,000, swelling the grand total to at. enormous amount.

The total amount of capitaliza tion for the whole year will make an interesting story when the amount for the entire year is given. Tlie Best Plaster.
