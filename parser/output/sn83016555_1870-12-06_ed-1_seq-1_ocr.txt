I-iONDON, November 5.—It is rumored that M. Erlangor i* storing vast quantities of provisions at Havre lor Paris when the siege is over. Earl Granville's reply to Prince Gorts ehakotfs lust note is published. It is dated November 29. The British minister says there is nothing for him to add to Ins pre vious appeal to international law. He is aware that the suggestions for a congress of the Powers to settle this and other ques tions have been made but-not adapted. Ho is also aware that in the contingency of the possession of -the principalities by Austria, Prussia could question the provisions of the treaty of 1856. He is, however, ignorant of such a pifr pose; therefore that uuestiyp could not be introduced. He trusts that all obstacles to the continuance of peaceful relations will be re moved. If Russia lias formed an opinion as to lier rights, but does not intend to act without consulting the other powers, the controversy is already partially closed. Earl Granville concludes by accepting Russia's invitation to a conference, without admitting a foreign conclusion as to the re TOXJBS. Orleans Evacuated by the Army of tbe Loire—Prussians Re-en»er Orleans— Fighting Before Orleans Unfavorable to the French. Tours, December 5. —The Army of the Loire, after spiking gnus and destroying ammunition, evacuated Orleans. The Prus sians re-entered Orleans at midnight. The French retreated orderly. [New York Herald special.] Tours, December 5.—The results of the lighting beiore Orleans are unfavorable to the French. Orleans was evacuated Satur day night and the Army of the Loire re treated to Blois. There was much desultory fighting Friday and Saturday along the whole line, from Ouzore to Artlicnay, and the left wing of the Army of the Loire was doubled up. The Prussians readied the railroad between Orleans and Tours at Ea chapelle, near' Orleans, on Satnrday after noon, when a train which Gambetta was on was fired into. I The army of the Loire then concentrated in lines at Orleans, entrenched a camp 200.000 strong, defended by 500 froumhc navy and determined to hold out there to the last moment, notwithstanding the line of retreat was threatened by the success of the Prussians' left wing, and it was ren dered ineffective for defense. The Prus sians threatened to bombard the city, but to prevent this General Patheres consented to evacuate the city at midnight, when heavy cannon were spiked and ammunition destroyed. The army then withdrew in good order, retreating to the left bank ot the Loire. __ VERSAILLES. The French Driven from Chevilly—Troops Suffering from Intense Cold.

To th«* Senate and House of Representatives^ A year of jieace and general prosperityAp the nation has passed since the last assem bling of Congress. We have, through a kiml Providence, been blessed with abun dant crops, and have been spared from com plications and war - with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been restored. It is" to lie regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise . ha?, by violence and intimidation, been de- " nied to citizens, in exceptional cises, in sev eral of the States lately in rebellion, and tbe verdict of the people has thereby been re versed. The States bf Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have been restored to representa tion in our national councils. Georgia, the only State now without repre sentation, may lie confidently expected to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year, add then, let us hope, will he completed the work of reconstruction. With an acquiescence ou the part ol the whole people in the national obligation to pay the public debt, created as the price ot onr Union, tfie pensions to our disabled sol diers aud sailors and their widows anil or phans, aud in the changes to Cite eon.'titu lion, which have been made necessary by a great rebellion, there i- no reason why we .should not advance -in materia and happiness Wr no after so protracted Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe, the protection of the United States Minister at Palis was invoked i'i favor of North Germans domiciled in Fiance. Instructions were issued to grant the protection This has been followed by an extension of American protec tion to citizens of Saxony. Hesse and Saxe Coburg. Gotha, Columbia. Portugal, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Ecua dor. Chili, Paraguay and Yenzuela. In Paris the charge was'an onerous one, requir ing constant aud severe labor, as well as .the exercise of patience, prudence and good judgment. It has been performed to the entire satisfaction of this government, and, as 1 am officially informed, equally to the satisfaction of* the government of North German v. As soon as 1 learned that a reputiiic nail been proclaimed at Paris, and that the people of France had acquiesced in the change, the minister of the United States was directed by telegraph to recognize it aud to tender my congratulation* amt tr.ose of the people of the United States. The re establishment in France ot ;<• sr.-tom of government disconnected with >ac dynastic traditions of Europe, appeared to be an ap propriate subject, -tor tiie felicitations qi Americans. Should the present snuggle result in attaching tbe ticaxts of the French to our simpler forms of representative gov ernment, it would he a subject oi sti.l xur ther satisfaction to our people. While we make no effort to impose our in stitut.ons upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we adhere to our tradi tional neutrality in civil contests elsewhere, we can not lie indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France. We were asked by the new government We were asked by the new government to use our good offices, jointly with those oi European powers, in tin interests of peace. Answer was made that the established policy and the true interests of tbe United State's forbade them to interfere in Euro pean questions jointly with European pow ers. I ascertained, informally and unoffi eially. that the government of North Ger- | many was not then disposed to listen to , such representations trom any power, . and j tliongh earnestly wishing to see the bless ings of peace restored to the belligert nts. with all of whom the United States are on terms of friendship. I declined on the part of this government to take a step which could oulv result in injury to our true interests, without advancing tlie on jectfor which our intervention was invoked. Should the time come when the action of the United States can ha-ten the l'etuiu of peace bv a single hour, that action will be heartily* token. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number < t persons ol German and FrenTffi birth living in the United State?, to issue, soon alter official notice if A state of war had been received from Loth belligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of tlie, United States as a neutral power and the obligations ol persons resid ing within their territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This procla mation was followed by others, as circum stances seemed to call tor them. Tic peo ple. thus acquainted iu advance of thc-ir duties and obligations, have assisted ii: pre venting violations of the neutrality of the United States. It is not understood that the condition o*' the insurrection in Cuba lias materially changed since tlie close ol the la 3 t session of Congress. In an early stage of the con test the authorities of Spain inaugurated a svstem oi arbitrary arrests, of close confine ment. and of military trial and execution of persons suspected of complicity w insurgents, and of summary embargo of their properties and sequestration of their revenues by executive warrant, but h pro ceedings. so far as they affected the per sons or property of citizens of the United violation of the provisions "iVh'the I outlie t:vent v ' of' 1795"bet ween the inked i Statcs aud Spain. Representations of it ulting to several persons flTainiin pint. to be citizens of the United States, by reuse of such violations, were made to the Spanish government. F#un April, lHi'id. to June last, the Span ish Miuiijterat Washington had been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power wa* found to be withdrawn in view, it was said, "of the favorable condition in which the island of Cuba" then "was;" which, however, did ir-t lead to a revocation or suspension oi the ex traordinary and arbitrary functions exer cised liy the executive power in Cuba, and wo were, obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In the negotiations thus opened, and still pending there, the United States only claimed that for the future the l ights secured to, their citizens by treaty should he respected in Cuba, and that as to the 7>ast, a joint tribunal should be established iu the United States, with full jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such au impar tial tribunal, each claimant would he re quired to prove his case. On tlie other hand, Spain would he at liberty to traverse every material fact, and tlins complete equity would lie dove. A case which at one time threatened seri ously to affect the relations •between the United States and Spain, has already been disposed of iu this way: The claim of the owners of the Golonel Lloyd Aspinwall, for the illegal seizure, and detention of that vessel, wa* referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has resulted iu an award to the United States, for the owners, of the sum of nineteen thousand seven hundred and two dollars and fifty cents iu gold. Another and long pending claim of like nature, that oT the whale ship Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitrament during the present year. It was referred, by tbe joint consent of Brazil and the United States, to the decisionjrf Sir Edward Thornton, her British Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony sub mitted by the two governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of one hundred thousand seven hundred and forty dollars anil nine cents in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial government. These recent examples show thatthe mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, and that it may be rgreed toby either nation without dishonor. It ,s to he hoped that this moderate demand may Vie acceded to by Spaih without further de lay. Should the pending negotiations un fortunately and unexpectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to com municate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject. The long deferred peace conferenoe be tween Spain and the allied South American Republics has been inaugurated in Wash ington, under the auspices of tbe Unified States. Pursuant to the recommendation contained in the resolution of the House of | Our policy should ,,f tjii* policy, "so an to all' interests of* the Spanish more closely to our own, Representatives of the seventeenth of De cember, 18b6, the executive department of the government ottered its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and harmony be tween Spain and the allied Republics. Hesi tations and obstacles occurred to the ac ceptance of the offer. Ultimately, however, a conference was arranged and was opened in this city on the twenty-ninth of October last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers ot Spain, Pern. Chili and Ecuador. Inconsequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia, the conference was adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could be secured, or other measures could be adopted toward compass ing its objects. The allied and other re publics of Spanish origin on this continent may see'sn this fact a new proof of our sin cere interest in their welfare, and our de sire to sco them blessed with good govern ments, capable of maintaining order and of preserving their respective territorial integ rity, and of our sincere wisli to extend our owu commercial and sociul relations with them. The time is not probably far distant when, j in the natural/ourse of events, the European ' political eonuection with this continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped, in view " ' ■' ally the commercial ish American States losely to our owu, and thus give the United States all the preeminence and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Ad ams and Mr. Clay contemplated, when they proposed to join in the Congress of Panama. During the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation of the Republic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. J was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of this country, com mercially and materially, demanded its rati fication. Time has only confirmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the mojueut it is known that the United "States have entirely abandoned the project of ac cepting as a part of its territory the island of San Domingo, a free port will he negotiated for "by European na tion 3 . in the Bay of Samana. A large commercial city will spring up, to which we will be tributary without re ceiving corresponding benefits, and then will be seen tbe folly of onr neglecting so great a prize. The government of San Do mingo has voluntarily sought this annexa tion. i. is a weak power, numbering probably less than one hundred aud twenty thousand souls, and yet possessing one of the richest territories under the sun, capa ble oi supporting a population of ten mil-' lions of people in luxury. The people of Sau Domingo are not capable of maintain ing themselves in their present condition,and must look for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws, our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse them.' " The acquisition of San Domingo is desira ble because of its geographical position. It commands the entrance to the Carribean Sea and the Isthmus, transit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the for est, mine and soil of any of the West Indian islands. Its possession by us will in a few years lmild up a coastwise commerce of im mense magnitude, which will go far toward to us our lost merchant marine, re to us those articles which we __ > ^ _ j t %viJ! t . 0 ,. c , lr _.T go largely and do not produce, ^ i;;s equalizing our exports and imports, j n c ase of foreign war it will give us com n:a:id of all tlie islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. At present our coast trade between States bordering ojt the Atlantic and those border ing on the Gulf of Mexico is cut in two by tin- Bahamas and the Antilles. Hence we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to get by sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida. San Domingo, with a stable government under which her immense resources can be developed, will give re bumerative wages to tens of thousands of laborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of every availa ble means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom audits sequence, each inhabitant receiving the row aid of his own labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abandon slavery as a measure of self-preservation to retain their ianorers. San Domingo will be come a large consumer of the products of Northern farms and manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food, tools and machinery, will nu ke it necessary that contiguous islands should have the same advantages, in order to compete in the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropica! fruits, etc. This win open tons a still wider market fur our product*. The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our an nual imports, besides largely increasing our exports. W ith such a picture, it is easy to sec how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us. including interest, on bonds held »*Y foreigners, and mone^ spent by onr citi ns traveling iu foreign lands, equal to the j entire yield of the precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this re sult is to he otherwise accomplished. i he acquisition of .San Domingo is an ad herence to the ''.Monroe doctrine." It is a measure of national protection. It is us perting our just cluiui to a controlling influ ence in the great commercial traffic soon to flow from West to East by way of the Isth mus of Darien. It is to build up our mer chant marine. It is to furnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops and manufactories. It is to make slavery in supportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil. It i* to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba and end an exterminating conflict. It is to provide honest means of paving our honest debts without overtaxing the people. It is to fur nish our citizens with the necessaries of every-day life at cheaper rates than ever before, and it is. in tine.a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, in dustry and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume among nations. in view of the importance of this ques tion, I earnestly urge upon Congress early action, expressive of its views ns to the 1« st means of acquiring San Domingo. My sug gestion is that by joint resolution of the two houses of Congress, the Executive he au thorized to appoint a commission to nego tiate a treaty with the authorities of Nan Domingo for the acquisition of that island, and that au appropriation lie made to defray the expenses of such commission. The ques tion may then he determined, either by the action oi<tlie Senate upon the treaty, or the joint action of the two houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Texas. So con vinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisition of San Domingo, aud of the great disadvantages, I might almost say calamities, to flow from non-acquisition, that I believe tlie subject has only to l>e investi gated to Vie approved. It is to be regretted that our representa tions iu regard to the injurious effects, especially upon the revenue of the United States, by the policy of the Mexican govern ment in exempting from import duties a large tract of its country on our borders, have not only been fruitless, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege ad verted to has been hitherto enjoyed. 'I he expediency of taking into yottr serious con sideration the proper measures for eouuter acting the policy referred to, will, it is pre sumed, engage your earnest co-operation. It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against the impuntiy oi" those who may have committed high crimes within their border, and who have sought refuge abroad. For this pur-, pose extradition treaties have been con cluded with gpveral of the Central Ameri can Republics, nnd others are in progress. The sense of Congress is desired as early as may be convenient upon the proceedings of the commission on claims against Vene zuela, as communicated in my messages of March 16, 1869, March 1,1870 afid Marli 31. 1870. It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of tlie money which lias been received from that government until Con gress shall have acted ppon the subject. The massacres of French and Prussian residents at Tientzin, under circumstances of great barbarity, were supposed by some to have been premeditated and to indicate a purpose among the jiopulaee to extermi nate foreigners in the Chinese Empire. The .evidence fails to establish such a supposi tion, but shows a complicity between tlie local authorities and the mob. The gov ernment at Pekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfil its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do so. Unfortu nately, the news of tlie war between the U/tvn.nn Clnlnu • i.. ll l*' I 11 111l> Ill'll ( hltia Gcrrnun States and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind lieeaine possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that tlie time was coming when the superstitious masses might expel all foreigners and res tore mandarin influence. Anticipating trouble from this cause, 1 invited Fiance and North Germany to make an authorized suspension of hostilities in tbe East, where' ^hey were temporarily suspended by act of tlie commanders, and to act together for tbe future protection in China of tlie lives and properties of Americans and Europeans. Since the adjournment of Congress^ the ratification of the treaty with Great Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the Sup pression of the slave trade has been ex changed. It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Af rica, whence the slaves are taken to Arabiau markets. The ratifications of the natural ization convention between Great Britain and tbe United States have also been ex changed during the recess, aud thus a long standing dispute between the two govern ments lijs been settled in accordance with the principles always contended for by the United States. . In April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation near Pembina, a corps of engineers discovered that the commonly received boundary line between the United States and the British possessions at that place was about forty-seven hundred feet south of the true position of tbe forty-ninth parallel, and that the line when run on wliat is now supposed to be the true position of that parallel would leave the fort of the Hudson Bay Company at Pembina within the territory of the United States. This in formation being communicated to the British government, I was requested to con sent and did consent that the British occupation of the lbrt of the Hudson Bay Company should con tinue for the present. I deem it im portant, however, that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed by a joint commission of the two governments, aiid 1 submit herewith estimates of the ex pense of such a commission on the part of the United States, and recommend that an appropriation he made for that purpose. The land boundary has already been fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the Georgian bay.* It should now be in like manner marked' from the Lake of tlie Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains. I regret to say that uo conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain, growing out of the course adopted by that government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its views have been expressed, docs not appear to he willing to concede that Her Majesty's government was guilty of any negligence,' or did, or permitted any act during the war by which the United .States has just cause of complaint. Our firm and unalterable convictions are tlffc-tiy the reverse. I therefore recom mend to Congress to authorize the appoint ment of a commission to take proof of the amounts and of the ownership of the several claims, on notice to the representa tive of her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the settlement of these claims by the i "nited States, so that the government shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsi ble control of all the demands against Great Britain. It can not be necessary to add tluTT whenever her Majesty's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the , United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion con sistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. The course pursued by tlie Canadian au tl^ities toward the United States during the past season lias not. been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of tlie convention of 1818, between Great Britain and tbe United States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in common with British sub jects, tbe right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined, the waters not in cluded in tlie limits* named in the conven tion within three miles of the British coast. It lias been the custom for many years to give to intruding fishermen of the United States reasonable warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction to or control of these in-slmre fishing grounds to the colonial authority known i(R the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent hut irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers iu an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized, without notice or warning, in violation of. tlie custom pre viously prevailing, and have been takeu into tlie colonial ports, their voyages broken up and the vessels condemned. There is rea son to believe that this unfriendly and vex atious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this government. The statutes of the dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United- States. They author ize officers or persons to bring vessels hover ing within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada into port, to search the cargo, to examine the master, on oath, touching tlie cargo aud voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given; and if such a vessel is found "prepar ing to fish" within three marine miles ot any of such coasts, hays, creeks or harbors with out a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, etc., shall lie forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as may lie neoessary to protect tlie rights of the citizen* of the United .States. It has been claimed by her Majesty's offi cers that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the opeu jiorts of the British possessions in North America, except for the purpose of shelter and re pairing damage^ ol" purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they have no right to enter at the British customhouses or to trade there, except in the purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart within twenty-four hours after notice to leave. It Ls not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on an al leged construction of the convention of 1818, it can not he acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted <m by her Majesty's govern ment. During the conferences which pre ceded the negotiation of the convention of 1818, the British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the privilege of carrying on trade with any of His Britanic Majesty's subjects residing* within the limits assigned for their use; and also that it should not lie "lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in said fishery to have ou board any goods, wares or merchandise whatever, said fishing grqpad|| and any vessel of tbe United States which shall contravene this regulation may be seized, condemned and confiscated with her cargo." This proposition, which is identical with tlie construction now put upon the language of the convention, was emphatically re jected by the American commissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British plenipotentiaries, and article I, as It now stands in the convention, was substituted. If, however, it be srtid that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes, and not upon the convention, this govern ment can not hut regard them as unfriendly ami in contravention of the spirit if not ot the letter of tbe treaty, for the fhithful execution of which the imperial govern ment is jilorte responsible. Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in tne coming sea son to repeat their unneighliorly acts toward repeat tneir unneigliboriy act* twward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to susnend by proclamation the operation of tne laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchandise in bond across tbe territory of the United States to Canada; and, further, should such an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend the. operation of any laws whereby the vessels of tlie Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States. A like unfriendly disjiosition has been manifested on the part of Canada in the, maintenance of a claim of right to exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with an aggregate population ot about 17,600,000 inhabitants, with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367_tons upon tbe waters which discharge into it. Tlie foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British comjietition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the Ameriean seamen bo excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of the Lake ports with the Atlantic would b« in foreign hands, their vessels on trans Atlantic voyages having an access to our Lake ports which would be denied to Amer iean vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to retute its justice. During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams Mr. Clay unanswerably de monstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Con gress of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the judgment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to-enjoy the navigation of that river to and into the ee». even though passiug through the territories of another power. This right does hot ex clude the co-equal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea, to make such regulations relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably neceMary, but these regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of amity and should not im pose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right ot transit It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement. Tbe United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence which -may be suggested bv Great Britain. If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just, when the population of States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from the increased popula tion, wealth, production and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument iu. behalf of our right, the principle for which he contended has been frequently and by various rations recognized by law or by treaty, ami has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence in 1831, tlie Rhino was declared free from the point where it is first navi free from the point free from the point where it is first navi free from the point gable unto tbe sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835, tlie navigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both crowns. Iu 1853 the Argentine Confedera tion, bv treaty, threw ojien the free naviga tion of the i'arena and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 185b the Crimean war was closed by a treaty wliich provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers Ama zon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the com merce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December. 1866, the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial decree, declared the Amazon to lie opened to the frontier of Brazil to* the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority on this subject, while asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says: " It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may "round her refusal upon strict law: but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that she ex ercises harshly an extreme and hard law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in "hiring and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi." On the ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On the >' round that she iiossesscs both banks ot tbe St. Lawrence, where it disembogues itsell" into tlie sea. she denies to the United States the right of navigation, thoii"h about one half of the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which the river flows, arc the property ot the United States. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard. To the citizens of these States it secures a greater return for their labor. To the in habitants of the seaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation, an increase in the an nual surplus of wealth, It is hoped that the government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Canadian provinces have urged her ad herence. Our depressed commerce is a sub ject to which I called your special attention at the last session, and suggested that we will in the future have to look more to tlie countries south of us, and to China and Japan for its revival. * Our representatives to all these govern ments have exerted their influence to en courage trade between the United States and the countries to wliich they are accred ited. But the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and while this state of affairs exists we cau not control our due share of the com merce ef the world. That between tlie Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted iu American vessels. I would recommend a liberal policy toward that lino of American steamers. One that will insure its success and even increased usefulness. The cost of building iron ves sels, the only oues that can compote with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than in foreign countries, that without some assis tance from the government they can not be sucoeaiffully built here. There will be several propositions laid be fore Congress in the course of the^ present session, looking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the national treasury, I hope such encourage ment will be given as will secure American shipping on the high seas aud American shiti building at homo. The condition of the archives tit the De partim n't of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now rented by that Department is a frail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and from tho other Departments. It is iU adapted for thepuTpose for which > f continued ou uions yaou.
