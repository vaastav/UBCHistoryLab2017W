"My children were afflicted with what they called ringworm of the scalp contracted from a house-cat they were playing with. The ringworm formed on their scalps about the size of a silver dollar and their hair fell out, leaving a round scale or crust on their scalps. Their hair fell out In round spots. There was terrible itching, and they scratched till the blood came. They were very fretful and could not sleep at night, and they were very cross. "They were treated for several months with no Improvement whatso ever. I was told they would never have any hair and would always be bald. Then I began using Cuticura Boap In connection with. Cuticura Ointment and the first week I could see the wonderful remedies were do ing all they w.ere claimed to do and in six weeks' time they were entirely cured.

Poisons excreted by past crops and left behind in the soil to depress the growth of succeeding crops of the same kind have been reported, and be lieved In, by agricultural experts. Their theory is disproved by Work con ducted at the great Rothamsted exper imental station in England, and pre sented in the transactions of the Royal society of London by Alfred D. Hall, P. R.

Some people are wise enough to try hew foods and beverages and then generous enough to give others the benefit of their experience. A wife writes: '; "No slave in chains, it seemed to me, was more helpless than I, a coffee captive. Yet there were innumerable warnings waking from a troubled Bleep with a feeling of suffocation, at times 'dizzy and out of breath, attacks of palpitation of the heart that fright ened me. (Tea is just as injurious as coffee because it contains caffeine, the same drug found in coffee.) "At last my nervous system was so disarranged that my physician ordered 'no more coffee.' I capitulated. "Determined to give Postum a fair trial, I prepared it according to direc tions on the pkg., obtaining a dark brown liquid with a rich snappy fla vour similar to coffee. When cream and sugar were added, it was not only good but delicious. "Noting its beneficial effects in me the rest of the family adopted it all except my husband, who would not ad mit that coffee hurt him. Several weeks elapsed during which I drank Postum two or three times a day, when, to my surprise, my husband said: 1 have decided to drink Postum. Your improvement is so apparent you have such fine color that I pro pose to give credit where credit is due.' And now we are coffee-slaves no longer." - Name given by Postum Co., Battle Creek, Mich.

'UTPiinii raumn iiiiuwuL uiimiiu President Wilson Says Husrta's Message Asks Legislation Farmers Urges Presidential Washington, Dec. 2. The president today delivered the following message to congress: In pursuance of my constitutional duty to "6've to the congress informa tion of the state of the Union," I take the liberty of addressing you on sev eral matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to engage the at tention of your honorable bodies, as of ail who stndy the welfare of the nation. I shall ask your indulgence if I ven ture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called for the action of the several departments of the government or which look to them for early treat ment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which I should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, In which these subjects are set forth in careful de tail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your commit tees and of all members of the con gress who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the government, makes comment and emphasis on my part un necessary. Country Is at Peace. the country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obli gations and the interpretation of those already assumed. Huerta Must Lei Go. There is but one cloud upon our ho rizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace In America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on ill hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States. We are the friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship, work out their own development in peace ana UDerty. Mexico has no govern ment. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national author ity. It originated In the usurpation of Victoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of con stitutional president, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the citizens of other countries "resident within her territory can long be suc cessfully safeguarded, and' which threatens, if long continued, to im peril the interests of peace, order and tolerable life in the lands immedi ately to the south of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the constitution of the republic and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventful downfall would have left the country in a more de plorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the col lapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our pol icy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her leaders as pre fer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions. Currency Reform. I turn to matters of domestic con cern. You already have under con sideration a bill for the reform of our system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with Impati The Easier Way. "How did Calkins , get the right to stick that 'Hon.' in front of his name? He never was in congress, was her' "No, but he once impersonated a member of congress over the tele phone."

J'idge 10 rrvinsn nmin ig iiiCAiuiiii ruuu Prestige Is Fast Crumbling- for Facilitating Credits Needed by Primaries. ence, as for something fundamental to Its whole business life and neces sary to set credit free from arbitrary and artiflcial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early en actment into law. I present to you, in addition, the urgent necessity that special provision be made also for faoilltating the cred its needed by the farmers of the coun try. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. It puts them, upon an equal footing with oth er business men and masters of en tea-prise, as it should; and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in the field of credit The farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special privilege such as extending to them the credit of the government itself. What they need and should obtain is legislation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit resources avail able as a foundation for Joint, con certed local action In their own be half in getting the capital they must use. It Is to this we should now ad dress ourselves. Allowed to Lag. It has, singularly enough, come to pass that we have allowed the Indus try of our farms to lag behind the other activities of the country in its development. I need not stop to tell you how fundamental to the life of the Nation Is the production of Its food. Our thoughts may ordinarily be concentrated upon the cities and the hives of industry, upon the cries of the crowded market place and the clangor of the factory, but It is from the quiet interspaces of the open val levs and the free hillsides that we draw the sources of life and of pros perity, from the farm and the ranch, from the forest and the mine. With out these every street would be si lent, every office deserted, every fac tory fallen into disrepair. And yet the farmer does not stand upon the same footing with the forester and the miner in the market of credit. He is the servant of the seasons. Nature determines how long he must wait for his crops, and will not be hurried In her processes. He may give his note but the season of its maturity depends upon the season when his crop ma tures, lies at the gates of the market where his products are sold. And the security he gives is of a character not known in the broker's office or as fa miliarly as it might be on the counter of the banker. Efficiency In Farming.' The agricultural department of the government is seeking to assist as never before to make farming an effi cient business, of wide co-operative ef fort, in quick touch with the markets for foodstuffs. The farmers and the government will henceforth work to gether as real partners in this field, where we now begin to see our way very clearly and where many intelli gent plans are already being put into execution. The treasury of the Uni ted States has, by a timely and well considered distribution of its depos its, facilitated the moving of the crops in the present season and prevented the scarcity of available funds too oft en experienced at such times. But we must not allow ourselves to de pend upon extraordinary expedients. We must add the means by which the farmer may make his credit constant ly and easily available a'nd command when he will the capital by which to support and expand his business. We lag behind many other great countries of the modern world in attempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left bur farmers to shift for themselves in the ordinary money market. You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embarrassment which have been put upon those who pro duce our food. Study Rural Credit. Conscious of thig backwardness and neglect on our part, the congress re cently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the vari ous systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Eur ope, and this commission is already prepared to report Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to our own farmers. Let Sherman Law Stand. Turn from the farm to the world of business which centers In the city and in the factory, and I think that all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe the business communities of the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been pre vented. I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti trust law stand, unaltered, as it Is, with Its debatable ground about it, In Real Life. "Hear you had a romance at the beach. Rescued by a handsome young man, eh?" ' ' "Oh, no romance. He wasn't hand some and he had been eating limburg er." , A Lesson in Politeness. "Butdaughter, why didn't you tell the young man to stop kissing you?" asi -d the mother. - V'.Yhy, mother, you know you taught me never to interrupt anyone!" but that we should as much as posst ble reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also supple ment that great act by legislation which will not only clarify It but also facilitate Its administration and make it fairer to all concerned. No doubt we shall ill w ish, and the country will expect, this to be the central subject of our deliberations during the pres ent session; bat it is a subject so many-sided and so deserving of care ful and discriminating discussion that I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon It in a special message at a later date than this. It Is of capital importance that the business men of this country should be relieved of all uncertainties of law wjth regard to their enterprises and investments and a clear path Indicated which they can travel without anxiety. It Is as Im portant that they should be relieved of embarrassment and set free to prosper as that private monopoly should be destroyed. The ways of action should be thrown wide open. I turn to a subject which I hope can be handled promptly and with out serious-controversy of any kind. I mean the method of selecting nomi nees for the presidency of the United States. I feel confident that I do not misinterpret the wishes or , the ' expectations of the country when I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections through out the country at which the voters of the several parties may choose their nominees for the presidency without the intervention of nominating con ventions. Independence for Philippines. These are all matters of vital do mestic concern, and besides them, out side the charmed circle of our own national life in which our affections command us, as well as our con sciences, there stand out our obliga tions toward our territories over sea. Here we are trustees. Porto Rico, Hawaii, the Philippines, are ours, once regarded as mere possessions, are no longer to be selfishly exploited; they are part of the domain of public con science and of serviceable and enlight ened statesmanship. We must admin ister them for the people who live in them and with the same sense of re sponsibility to them as toward our own people In our domestic affairs. No doubt we shall successfully enough bind Porto Rico and the Hawaiian is lands to ourselves by ties of justce and affection, but the performance of our duty toward the Philippines is a more difficult and ueoataDie matter We can satisfy the obligations of gen erous justice toward the people of Porto Rico by giving them the ample and familiar rights and privileges ac corded our own citizens in our own territory and our obligations toward the people of Hawaii by perfecting the provisions of self-government already granted them, but in the Philippines we must go further. We must hold steadily in view their ultimate Inde pendence, and we must move toward the time of that Independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and per manently laid. Double Duty Toward Alaska. A duty faces us with regard to Alas ka which seems to me very pressing and very Imperative; perhaps I should say a double duty, for It concerns both the political and the material develop ment of the territory. The people of Alaska should be given the full terri torial form of government, and Alas ka, as a storehouse, should be un locked.' One key to it is a system of railways. These the government should itself build and administer, and the ports and terminal!! it should Itself control in the interest of all who wish to use them for the service and de- elopment of the country and its peo ple. Specially Important. Three or four matters of special im portance and significance I beg that you will permit me to mention in clos ing. Our bureau of mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render even more effectual service than it renders now in Improving the condi tions of mine labor and making the mines more economically productive as well as more safe. This is an all- important part of the work of con servation; and the conservation of human life and energy lies even near er to our interest than the preserva tion fron waste of our material re sources. We owe it, in mere Justice to the railway employes of the country, to provide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act; and a law that we can stand by In this matter will be no less to the advantage of those who administer the railroads of the country than to the advantage of those whom they e fiploy. The experi ence of a large number of the states abundantly proves that. ' We ought to devote ourselves to meeting pressing demands of plain justice. like this as earnestly as to the accomplishment of political and economic reforms. Social justice comes first. Law is the machinery for Its realization and Is vital only as it expresses and embodies it Rather Unusual. "What's your idea in getting up this premium list for tobacco coupons?"
