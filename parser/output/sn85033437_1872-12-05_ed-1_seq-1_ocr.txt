CONGRESSIONAL. SENATE. Washington, Dec. 4 The Senate elected Mr. Anthony President, protem, and adjourned. HOUSE. The House is considering Washington affairs. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Mr. Douglass, with Ex-Commissioner Rol lins, Supervisor Fulton, Mr. Totteu and others, appeared this morning before the Ways and Means Committe, warmly pressing the new bill of the Commissioner for the abolition of tho whole system of assessors and assistant assessors, and im posing the duties of those officers on the collectors and deputy collectors. The Sec retary of the Treasury, Mr. Boutwell, was also present on the same business. The indications are that the bill in substance will be reported by the Committee and w ill be passed by the House. Efforts are likely to be made to unseat the three Liberal Republicans as Chair men of the House Committees, Messrs. Banks, Blair and Farnsworth. Both Re publican organs of this city to-day express dissatisfaction with the continuance of these gentlemen in their official positions as chairmen of committies The Republican attributes the vote of the House last Monday against accepting the resignation of Mr. Banks to the argu ment of Mr. James Brooks, and censures the Republican members for following his counsel. There is a warm feeling on the subject, because the action of the House is regarded as an implied censure on the Sen ate in the cases of Messrs. Trumbull, Sum ner and others. It is probable that Messrs. Trumbull, Fenton and Rice will refuse the chair manships of their respective committees. The Committee on the District of Colum bia was directed to ascertain and report the debt of the District including all lia bilities incurred by the Board of public works, and the sum required to finish the work undertaken by the Board. Hon. R. B. Roosevelt, of New York, who moved the resolution declared that it was his con viction that the completion of the work would cost $20,000,000. A bill was introduced authorizing ten sloops of war. The bill was referred to the committee on appropriations. 

IMPOSING OBSEQUIES. n.it i r- . ' t : i f rOIUICai rnenaS . ana rOeS at Greeley's Grave. PRESIDENT GRANT AND CABINET ATTEND THE SERVICES. Inconsolable Grief of the Orphan Daughters. New Youk, Dec. 3. The interior of the Church of the Divine Paternity pre sented to-dav a somewhat beautiful ap pearance. The pulpit was heavily draped in crape, and long lines of crape were sus pended from everv pillar and every abut meut of the beautiful gotbic interior. The several offerings in tne cnurcn were ex quisito in design and appropriateness. The principal among them were the fol lowing : . I know that my Redeemer Liv eth" in red, on white ground and green body. At the rear of :the pulpitrwas'a sheaf of wheat '.from Chapnaqua. in the form of a crown, and suspended over head a pen and an axe. Around the pulpit were innumerable of ferings of flowers -and wreaths. In front of the pulpit was a beautiful design in flowers with tho words "It is done" in the center on a white border in purple letters with green border. On a tablet to the left of the pulpit was a floral wreath bearing tho letters "H. G." Then tuere were in flowers a plow from the Tribune office, a quill from the German Greeley club, a basket of flowers with a crown and cross from the Lincoln club, and a floral offer ings from the Lotos. Arcadian, Herald. and other clubs. As early as nine o'clock crowds flocked to the church, but only those having tickets succeeded in gaining admission. THE 

GREAT MEN OF THE REPUBLIC PPvES- ENT. By 10 o'clock tho galleries which had een reserved for the ladies were crowded. About 15 minutes before 11 o'clock. Presi dent Grant entered, and immediately fol- owing him were fcenator Wilson, Mims er Washburne and Secretary of War. Belknap. They took their seats on the right of the pulpit. Inero were also pres ent Carl Schurz, Lyman Treraaine, aud Vice President Colfax. Mr. Colfax look his seat next to tne President. Promptly at 11 o'clock the funeral pro-ces-ion started from Mr. Sinclair's house on 45th, street. Many affecting scenes took place there during the morning; Mr. Greeley's daughters were inconsolable in their grief. The corpse was bore by ten men.' Next came the clergy mourners and the Tribune associations and next the Her- aid club. Then followed in succession the military and civil officers of the United States located in this and adjoining cities; the officers of the Government of the State of New York, and of other States now in this city. " .- ? ': The Mayor and members of the Com mon Council of New York and Brooklyn, Jersey City, Long Island City, Newerk, and Elizabeth, representatives from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities. Then came the Judges from all the courts and a line of citizens of immense length. At 11:20 the procession entered the church. The solemnity of the pcene was of the most impressive character. The stillness was such that it seemed as though the people in the church scarcely breathed. Among those present were, Postmaster General Cresweil, Gen. Dix, Gov. Morgan, Gen. Sheridan, Gov. Ran dolph, of New Jersey, and a committee of twenty from the Union League Club. Rev. Dr. Chapin opened the funeral cer emonies by reading a selection from the Scriptures, many allusions being peculiar ly appropriate to the character of the de parted. Miss Clara L. Kellogg next sang very touchingly : "I know that my Re deemer liveth." 

BEECIIER'S FUNERAL ORATION. Rev. Henry Ward Beecher delivered the funeral oration. He said, "No one dies whose death is not momentous. Of all who have passed away not one has gone for a long time who will carry with them so much reverence, so much honor. 41 Who is this man ? Who gets all these civil honors ? Who Is this man ? Was he one of those great. prince3 of wealth? Was he one of great military renown ? No. And yet here are men from every walk in life. Here is our Chief Magistrate. Here are the most prominent citizens from all parts of the country gathered around the bier of this man who Is now no more. Here we see that criticism is disarmed. A little time ago and men's political pas isons.were all aroused and we differ as much on politics as ever, but here lies be fore us this man who but a brief time ago was a great leader in the land, and why do we of all parties gather here in rever ence around his remains ? It is because the man is greater than his politics. Here to day between the two oceans there is scarce ly a man or child who has not felt the bene ricient influence of the character of Horac Greeley. Horace Greeley gave the strength cf his life to education,-to humanity and especially to the poor who could little help themselves. He had a great heart that longed for sympathy. Though he may not be remembered by those me morials which carry other.:" men's uames down, he will be remembered throughout this land for those great qual ities of mind and-heart, which make his character commensurate, as It were, with the genius of this great republic. His in fluence has gone out to teach a noble man hood to the mechanic, the laborer and farmer. What more can we say in eulogy of the character of the illustrious dead ? Alas! alas! He through along and not in tempestuous voyage has reached the shore. "How blessed are the dead that die in the Lord." May God grant that in the sol emnity of these thoughts 'in which 5we have gathered here it may be our happy lot that when we die the angels shall open the gates and receive us into the glory of the Lord. DR. CHAPIN'S EULOGIUM. After music by the quartette from St. James and Xavier Church, Dr. Chapiu said: "To-day, in the freshness of his power, Horace Greeley is laid by the r side of hi3 beloved wife. As a pastor and a personal friend, I cannot now here attempt to depict the worth and greatness of the departed journalist. Horace Greeley's eDitanh is written in everv home through out the length and breadth of the land where are now all petty and religious. J r n" n -r 7 . , . umereuces ( x.asK you 10 consiaer ners what it is that brought forth so much love for this man. It was not any ofhcial post tion he held. Not it. It was not even his unquestionable genius. It was the attrac tion of pure and simple goodness. The hundreds of toil-worn men who, yesterday, waited for hours to look upon the face of the dead, were not drawn there by any mere curiosity ; they went to cast a look at the features of one who had been their consistent and untiring friend. Horace Greelev stuck to what he believed to be right until his mind and heart gave way. Let me remind you that Horace Greeley's life was remarkably practical, ana no man. it seems to me, was more siren to practical purposes than he: How many lives has he stimulated to wnolesome energy? How many of great interests of education and science and progress mourn him now? All these tributes to-day testify ta the re cognition of the virtues of this great and good man. The President of the nation joins in the tribute to the patriot and the man., (Murmurs ot applause.) Let me take occasion to urge Mr. Greeley's views of Christianity. "He lived on the essential truths of Christianity. He laid on them his weary head and weaiy heart and died weary with turmoil of life. Does truth come to us? '1 know that my Redeemer liveth.' In Horace Greeley, I recognize a proof of im mortality. He looked from the troubles of the surging world to the peace of the grave, where 'the wicked cease from troub eling and the weary are at rest.' I thank God from my heart and soul that when all this world was fading from his eyes he re marked, ' I know that my Redeemer liv eth.' It was the triumph of his life and of his death, and now as we take our brother from this church which has known him so often, but will know him no more, let this be our lesson we know that our Re deemer liveth. Farewell, dear friend, fare well noble associate, farewell great cham pion. We know that our Redeemer liveth, and God grant that like thee, we may know it when tho light of thisworld is fading from our eyes." The services were closed at 1:15 p. m., but the procession did not move till nearly 2 o'clock.

Editors : Upon inquiring into our city laws, I find that our City Fathers,- who have ' postponed the Municipal election two weeks, hold their office until their successors are elected and sworn into office. As the weather will probably be very cold at the time when the election takes place, and is very likely very dis agreeabla for candidates to electioneer, 1 pro pose that our City Fathers will postpone the election until the first Saturday in May next. It will give the old board plenty of time to set tle all their affairs up nicely, and also improve all out of the way streets in the surburb3 of our city. . A Tax Payer. Arrival or Frciffbfs.

We give to-day an addition al synopsis embracing points not fully given by telegraph. The. message opens as follows :fv-Vf ;i?r.;r - n',7 ,i To the Senate and House of Representatives: In transmitting to you this, my fourth annual message, it is with thankfulness to the Giver of all good that, as a nation we have been blessed for the past year with peace at home, peaco abroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few peoples. with the exception orrthe recent devas tating fire which swept- from the eartn, with a breath as it were, millions of accu mulated wealth in the city of Roston, there has been no overshadowing calamity within the vear to record. It is gratifying to note'how, like; their fellow-citizens of the city of Chicago, under similar circuui stances a year earlier, the citizens of Ros ton are rallying under their, misfortunes, and the prospect that their euergy and perseverence will overcome all obstacles, aud show the same prosperity soon that thev would had no disaster befell them. Otherwise we have been free from pesti ence. war. and calamities which often overtake nations; and as far as human udcrment can .penetrate the future, no ause seems to exist to threaten our pres ent peace.

.TOST QFJb'ICE DEPARTMENT. .The report of the Postmaster General furnishes a full and satisfactory exhibit of theoueration of the PostofUce Department during the year. The ordinary revenues of the Department for the fiscal year end ed June 30, 1S72, amounted to $21,915, 120 37, and the expenditures to $26,658, 192 31. Compared with the previous fis. cal year the increase of revenue was $1, 878.3S0 95, or 9,37 per cent., and the in crease of expenditures $2,268,088 93, or 9.29 per cent. Adding to the ordinary revenues the annual appropriation of $700,000 for free matter, and the amounts paid to the subsidized mail steamship lines from spe cial appropriations, the deficiency paid out of the general treasury was $3,317,765 94, an excess of $389,707 20 over the deficiency for the year 1871. Other interesting sta tistical information relating to our rapidly extending postal service is furnished in this report. The total length of railroad mail routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was 57,911 miles, 8,077 additional miles of such service having been put into operation during the year. Eight new lines of rail way post offices have been established with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 24,362, 500, an increase of 4,066,502, or twenty per cent, over the number in 1871, and the pos tage thereon amounted to $1,871,257 25.

In referring to the condition of the ku klux prisoners and the circumstances of their trials, &c, he says : I look with confidence to the time, not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all combinations prohibit ed by the acts referred to, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecution or inflict- punishments to protect citizens from the lawless doings oi such combina tions. Applications have been made to me to pardon persons convicted of a violation of said acts, upon the ground that clemen cy in such cases would tend to tranquilize the public mind and to test the virtue of that policy. I am disposed, ' as far as my sense of justice will permit, to give to these applications a favorable considera tion, but any action thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in my determination to enforce with vigor such acts so long as the conspi races and com binations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is regretted by no one more than my self, that a necessity has ever existed to execute the "enforcement act." No one can desire more than I that the necessity of applying it may never again be demand ed. I N'TERX AL 1M ntO VEMEXTS. The attention of Congress will be called during its present session to various enter prises for the more certain and cheaper transportation of the constantly increasing surplus of Western and .Southern products to the Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one that will force itself upon the legisla tive branches of the Government sooner or later, and I suggest that immediate steps be taken to gain all available information to insure equable and just legislation, : One route to connect the Mississippi val ley with the Atlantic at Charleston, rf. C, and Savannah, Ga., by water, by way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, and canals and slack water navigation to the Savan nah and Ocmulgce rivers has been survey ed and report made ly an accomplished j engineer officer of the army. Second and third new routes will be proposed to the consideration of Congress, namely, by the extension of the Kanawha and James riv er canal to the Ohio, and by the extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I am not psepared to recommend Gov ernment aid to these or other enterprises until it is clearly shown that they are not only of national interest, but that when completed they will be of a value commen surate with their cost. Referring to the Secretary of the Interi ors suggestion for a national census in 1875. He savs: it would probably obviate tne con stitutional provision regarding the decen Dial census, if a census taken in lso should be divested of all political character and no re-appointment of Congressional representation be made under it. Such a census, coming as it would in the last year or the first century of our national exis tence, would furnish a noble monnmentof the progress of the Lnited States during that century.
