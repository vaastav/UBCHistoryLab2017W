THE MESSAGE PRESIDENT CLEVELAND PRE SENTS IIIS ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF CONGRESS. THE PRESIDENT OUTLINES THE ADMINISTRATION POLICY REL ATIVE TO HAWAII. Tariff Reform Is Again Urged—An Income Tax Favored—A Modilica tion of tbe Bond Law Recommended —Economy in All Lines Advised — Mr. Cleveland Denounces Free Seed Distribution—Tbe Brazilian Revolu tion, Chinese Exclusion Act and a Score of Other Matters Officially Considered. Washington, Dec. 4. —The following is the message of President Cleveland as transmitted to congress: To the congress of the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give to the con gress information of the state of the union, and fCcommend to their consideration such meas ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, Is fittingly entered upon by commending to the Congress a careful examination of the detailed Statements and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of the heads of departments, who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. In an ef !ort to abridge this communication as much as S consistent with i*s purpose, 1 shall supple hent a brief reference to the contents of these bpartmental reports by the mention of such Executive business and Incidents as are not Embraced therein, and by such recommenda tions as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. Peaceful Foreign notations. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fair ness and love of justice, which, joined with con sistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. Argentine and Brazil Boundary Question. My predecessor having accepted tho office of arbitrator of the long-standing missions bound ary dispute, tendered to the president of the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duly to receive the special envoys commissioned by those stales to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their re spective governments. Tho Brazilian Insurrection. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in tnat country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the established government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the fialional capital and chief seaport, and ticking, as It does, the elements of di vided administration, 1 have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recog nition as belligerents. Thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive but Impartial observer of the unfortunate con flict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impar tial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as flow exists, 1 deemed It necessary to disavow n a manner not to bo misunderstood the un authorized action of our lute naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolted Brazil ian admiral, being indisposed to countenance fen act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrection. Chilian Claim Question. The convention between our government and Chili, having for Us object the 'settlement and Adjustment of the demands of the two countries f gainst each other, has been made effective by he organization of the claims commission pro tided :or. The two governments failing to agree tipon the third member of the commission, 'he good offices of the president of the Swiss tepubllc were invoked, as provided in the treaty, and the selection of the Swiss repre sentative in this country to complete theorgan liation was gratifying alike to the United States and Chili. The vexatious question of so- Wdled legation asylum for offenders against the ■date and its laws was presented anew In Chill by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving Into his of ficial residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt a I revolution and ■gainst, whom criminal charges were pending •Towing out of a fyrmer abortive disturbance. The doctrine o.' asylum applied to this case IS not sanctioned by the best precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and •ife. Under no circumstances can the repre sentatives of this government be permitted, finder the ill-defined fiction of extra territorial ity, to interrupt tho administration of criminal Justice In the countries to which they are ac credited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilian government for the correc tion ot this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to har bor the offenders. , Chinese Registration. The legislation of last year, known as the Jeary law. requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the Jnited States, and the deportation of all not (emptying with the provisions of the act within ho time prescribed, met with much opposition ; rom Chinamen In tills country. Acting upon he advice of eminent counsel that the law was I nco institutional, the great mass of Chinese aborers, pending judicial inquiry as toils val idity, in good faith declined to apply for the fcrtitlcatos required by its provisions. A test case upon pro. ceding by habeas Minus was brought before the supreme court, JajUi op May 15, its3, a decision was made by That tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed Thai under Ihc recent amendment of the act extending the time for registration the Chl filse laborers thereto entitled who desire to re side In this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of estab lishing by lawful procedure their right to re main. and that thereby the necessity of en forced deportation may to a great degree be avoided, The Murder of Missionaries In China. It lias devolved upon the United States min ister <vt Peitin, as dean of the diplomatic body and in the absence of a representative of Sweden and Norway, to press upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder Of Swedish missionaries at Sung-Pu. This oucstlon is of vital interest to all countries whose citizens engage in missionary work in the Interior. The Slave Trade in Africa. By article 1- of the general act of Brussels, signed July S, 

ISUU, for the suppression of the slave trade and the restriction of certain in jurious commerce in the independent state of the Congo, and in the adjacent zone of Central Africa, the United States and the other signa tory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means Jor the punishment of persons selling arms and ftmmunUion to the natives and for the confisca tion of the inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this government to aid in suppressing the nefarious traffic, im- E airing asjit does the praiseworthy and civ izing efforts now in progress in that region, I Recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and intoxicants to the natives in the regulated zone by our citizens. Extradition Treaties. Costa Rica has lately testified its friendli ness by surrendering to the United States, la the absence of a convention of extradition, but Upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a Ooted fugitive from lustice. It is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that cquntry to meet recurring oases of this kind will soon be accomplished In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition should be concluded with all those countries with which the United States has not already conventional arrange ments of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the governments of Costa Rica and Colombia the Kindly desire of the United States to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years Bgo. The Trench Republic. Our relations with the French republic con tinue to be Intimate and cordial. 1 sincerely tope that the extradition treaty with that country, as amended by the senate, will soon be Operative. Germany. While occasional questions, affecting our naiuralized citizens returning to the land of their birth, have arisen in our intercourse with Germany, our relations with that country cop--' unue satisfactory. Great Britain, The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated Ift a spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are In progress be tween the two governments with a view to such Concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Behring sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective; and it is not doubted that Groat Britain will cooperate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the discriminat ing toils imposed In the Welland canal, upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my prede cessor thereupon suspended his proclamation Imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit through our canals. A request for ad ditions to the list gf extraditable offenses coy - tv; ered by the existing treaty between >- - two countries is under consideration. Haytl. During ibe past year an American citizen em ployed In a subordinate commercial position In Haytl, after suffering a protracted imprison ment on an unfounded charge of smuggling, wag finally liberated on judicial examination. Upon urgent representation to the Havtien government a suitable indemnity was paid to the sufferer. By a law of Haytl a sailing vessel having discharged her cargo is refused clear ance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American shipowners who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country has been in sisted on with a view r of securing the removal of this cause of complaint. Honduras. Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Amapala, because her captain re fused to deliver up passengers in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our minister to that ountry under instructions protested against the wanton act and demanded satis faction. The government of Honduras, ac tuated by the sense of justice, and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of Its officers, and expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. It is confidently anticipated that a satis factory adjustment will soon oe reached of the questions arising out of the seizure and use of American vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by the successful government of commercial privileges to those vessels on that account. Kepublie of Liberia. A notable part of the southeasterly coast of Liberia between Cavlly and San Pedoro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally recognized as belonging to that republic by cession and purchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered into by the na tive tribes over whom Liberian control has not been well maintained More recently, nego tiations between the Liberian represent ative and the French government re sulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as an adjustment certain Liberian ter ritory is ceded to France. This convention at last advices had not been ratified by the Liberian legislature and executive. Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of this lit tle commonwealth, the establishment and de velopment of which were largely aided by the benevolence of our countrymen, and which con stitutes ihe only Independently sovereign state on the west coast of Africa, this government has suggested to the French government its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should lake place wiihout her uncon strained consent. Mexico. Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature which should always characterize the intercourse of two neighboring republics. The work of relocating the monu ments marking the boundary between the countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is now nearly completed. The commission re cently organized under the conventions of 1881 and 1889 it is expected will speedily settle dis putes growing out of the shitting currents of the Kio Grande river east of El Paso. Nicaragua and Guatemala. Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at first successful hav ing in turn been displaced by another. Our newly-appointed minister, by his timely good offices, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the controversy involved in the first conflict. The large American Interests established in that country in connection with the Nicaragua canal were not molested. The canal company has, unfortunately, become financially seriously embarrassed, but a generous treatment has been extended to it by the government of Nic aragua. The United States are especially in terested in the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinc tively American auspices, and its enjoyment assured, not only to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our At lantic and Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the world in the interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit of question. Guatemala has also been visited by the po litical vicissitudes which have afflicted her Central American neighbors, but the dissolu tion of her legislature and the proclamation of a dictatorship have been unattended with civil war. Extradition with Norway and Russia. An extradition treaty with Norway has re cently been proclaimed and exchanged. The extradition treaty with Russia, signed in March, 188*, and amended and confirmed by the senate in February last, was duly proclaimed last June. The Samoan Troubles, Led by desire to compose differences and con tribute to the restoration of order in Samoa, wnich for some years previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and na tive strife, the United States, departing from its policy consecrated by a century of observ ance, entered four years ago into the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound with England and Germany to establish and maintain Malietoa Laupepa as king of Samoa. The treaty provided for a foreign court of justice; a municipal council for the dis trict of Apia, with a foreign president thereof, authorized to advise the king; a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom. It imposed upon the three powers that part of the cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the Islands Early in the life of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it was designed to quell revived. Rivals defied the authority of the new king, refusing to pav raxes and de manding the election of a ruler by native suf frage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands. • Quite lately, at the request of the other powers, and in ful fillment of its treaty obligation, this govern ment agreed to unite in a joint military move ment of such dimensions as would probably se cure the surrender of the insurgents without bloodshed The warship Philadelphia was ac cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but be fore she arrived the threatened conflict wag precipitated by King Malletoa’s at tack upon tho insurgent camp. Mataafa was defeated and a number of men killed The British and German naval ves sels present subsequently secured the surren der of Mataafa and his adherents. The defeated chief and ten of his principal support ers were deported to a German island of the Marshall group, where they are held as prison ers under the joint responsibility and cost of the three powers. This incident and the events leading up to it singularly illustrate the Impolicy of establish ing alliances with foreign powers. impon-ant matters nave demanded attention in our relations with the Ottoman porte. The firing and partial destruction, by an unre strained mob, of one of the school buildings of Anatolia college, established by citizens of the United States at Marsovan. and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwithstanding the com plicity of some of its officials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was followed by promises of reparation and punish ment of the offenders. Indemnity for the in jury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American owners secured, and efficient protection guar anteed. Information received of maltreatment suf feved by an inoffensive American woman en gaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordls tan was followed by such representations to the porte as resulted in the Issuance ot orders for the punishment of her assailants, the re moval of a delinquent official, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this country not to identity them selves in good faith with our people, hut with the intention of returning to the land of their birth and there engaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without founda tion. A journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly counsels .its readers to arm, organize ar.d participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces. The Ottoman government has announced its intention to expel from its dominions Armenians who have obtained nat uralization in the United States since 1863. Will Protect Armenians. The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of sovereignty. It is a right asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced by the United States with the sanction of our highest court. There being no naturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey, our minister at Constantinople has been in structed that, while recognizing the right of that government to enforce its declared policy against naturalized Armenians, he is expected to protect them from unnecessary harshness or treatment. Relations with Venezuela. In view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela, consequent upon the recent revolu tion there, a modified arrangement for the sat isfaction of the awards of the late revisory claims commission, in progressive install ments, has been assented to and payments are being regularly made thereunder. The boun dary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet unadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic intercourse between the republic and Great Britain and reference of the ques tion to impartial arbitration, would be a most gratifying consummation. The ratification by Venezuela of the.conventlon.or the arbitration of the long deferred claim of the Venezuelan trans portation company, Is awaited. The Hawaiian Affair. It Is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to the installation of the present ad jnlnistration the existing government of Hawaii bad been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the Islands and the United States and submitted t<? the senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for exam ination,and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount,of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the cir cumstances attending the change of govern ment, and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough aud ex haustive examination Mr Blount submitted to mo his report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the yulted Slates which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our mlptfter, ypjn. ihq developed u seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and restore as far as prac ticable the status existing at tbe time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom plishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instruc tions to that end. A Special .Message Forthcoming. Thus far no Information of the accomplish ment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are soon ex pected. When received they will be promptly sent to the congress, together with all other in formation at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing ail the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all tne materi al events leading up to the present situation. Favorable to Arbitration. By a concurrent resolution, passed by the senate February 14, 190, and by tbe house of representatives on the 3d of April following, the president was requested to ‘ invite,from time to time, as 111 occasions may arise, negotiations with any government witn which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or dis putes arising between the two govern ments which cannot be adjusted by diplo matic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means." April 18. 1890. the international American con ference of Washington by resolution expressed the wish that all controversies between the re publics of America and the nations of Europe might lie settled by arbitration, and recom mended that the government of each nation represented in that conference should comm 1 !- nicate this wish to all iriendly powers. A favorable response has been received from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted in parliament July 16 last, cordially sympathizing with the purpose in view, and ex pressing ihe hope that her majesty’s govern ment will lend ready cooperation to the govern ment of the United States upon the basis of the concurrent resolution above quoted. It affords me signal pleasure to lay this parliamentary resolution before me congress, and to express my sincere gratification that the sentiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authori tatively manifest in favor of the rational and peaceable settlement of international quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration. Grade of Foreign Envoys Raised. Since the passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing the president to raise the grade of our envoys to correspond with the rank in whicn foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain. Prance. Italy and Ger many have conferred upon their representa tives at this capital the title of ambassador, and I have responded by accrediting the agent of the United States in those countries with the same title. A like elevation of mission is .announced by Russia, and when made will be similarly met. This step fittingly comports with the position the United States holds in the family of na tions. During my former administration 1 took occasion to recommend a recast of the laws re lating to the consular service in order that it might become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was intended to subserve. The duties and powers of consuls have been expanded with the growing require ments ot our foreign trade. Discharging im portant duties affecting our commerce and American citizens abroad, and in certain coun tries exercising judicial functions, these offi cers should be men of character, intelligence and ability. Copyright Extended to Denmark. Upon proof that the legislation of Denmark secures copyright to American citizens on equal footing with its own, the privileges of our copyright laws have been extended by procla mation to subjects of that country. Financial Statement. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, amounted to $481,716,561.94 and its expenditures to $459,374,674.29. There \sas collected from customs $2,5,355,016.73 and from internal rev enue $161,027,623.93. Our dutiable Imports amounted to $421,856,711, an increase of $52,453,- W>7 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a decrease from the preceding year of $13,455,447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preced ing year by $7,147,445.32. The total tax collected on distilled spirits we $94,730,260.55; on manufactured tobacco, 181,889,711.74, and on fermented liquor, $32,548,- 083.07. We exported merchandise during the (ear amounting to $847,665,194, a decrease of 182,612,954, from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting to 

SIOB 680,844, and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by $68,485,517. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was $9,375,130.88, an increase over the preceding year of $2,083,053.05. Estimates. It Is estimated upon the basis of present rev enue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1891, will be $430,- 121,365.38 and its expenditures $458,121,365.38, re sulting in a deficiency of 528.000,000. Our Circulation. On the first day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation, or pot Included in treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,- 682. an inciease for the year of $112,404,947. Es timating our population at 67,426,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was 525.49. On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to 596,657,273 and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $136.- £61,553 Silver Bullion Purchases. The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, aggregated S4, 008,162.59 fine ounces, which cost $45,531,- 4.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that tax became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the Ist day of November, 1893, was $168,674,- 590.46 fine ounces, which cost £155,930,- M 0.84. Between the Ist day of March, 1873, and the Ist day of November, 1893, the government purchased, under all laws, 603,- D05,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $316,622,- MB. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 36,087,285. The seigniorage arising from such coinage was §6,977,098.89, leaving on band in the mints 140,- g 9,760 fine ounces of silver, which.cost $126,755- Coinage Statistics. Oar total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of 97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was $80,038,140 in gold coin, $6,343,715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 In subsidiary silver coins and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins. Daring the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1,596,375 line ounces of gold ot the commercial and coinage value of $33,000,000 and 58,000,000 mine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50.- 750,000 and of me coinage value of $74,989,900. It is estimated that on the Ist day of July. 1898, the metallic stock of monoy in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,213,559,169, of which $597,697,685 was gold and $615,861,484 was silver. New ami Suspended Banks. One hundred and nineteen national hanks were organized during the year ending October 81, 1893 j with a capital of $1i,230,000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business and seven remained in the hands of bank ex aminers, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks organized forty-four were located in the eastern states, forty-one west of the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the central and southern states. The total number of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October, 1893. was 3,796. having an aggregate capital of $695.558.12D Net increase in the cir culation of these banks during the year was $36,886,972, Repeal of the Sliver Purchasing Clause. The recent repeal of the provisions- of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the com plexion of our currency affaira Ido not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any. supplementary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, appear to be essential or ex pedient. Confident of the Future. Of course, after the recent financial perturba tion, time is necessary for the reestablishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence the money which has been frigh ened into hoarding places Is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufflciet.. to meet every require ment of our Increasing population and busi ness. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan. In these circum stances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of being in jurious, will increase the probability of wise action. The Monetary Conference. The monetary conference which assembled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to the 3thn day of November in the present year. The considerations just stated and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be ex pected upon the reassembling of the conference led me to express a willingness to have the meeting still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authori ty T o the president to inyite other nations to such a conference at any time when there should be a fair prospect ol accomplishing ah international agreement on the subject of coinage. Recommendation Regarding Bonds. I desire also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of government bonds. The au thority now vested in the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as It should be, and the bonds authorized are dlsad l vantageoas to the government both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. Immigration Statistics* The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, reports that dur ing the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1,0§3 werq not permitted to land under the limitations of Ute law. and 577 were ray *'>ed to •'' coustrle from whence they came, by reason of their hav ing become public charges The total arrivals were 141.034 less than for the previous year. Prevention of Disease. The secretary in Lis report gives an account of the operation of the marine hospital service and of the good work done under its supervision in preventing the entrance and spread of con tagious diseases. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the demonstrated danger of the introduction of contagious diseases from foreign ports has invested the subject of national quarant.ne with increased interest A more general and har monious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere, and con stantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the invasion of disease, and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would. I be lieve, add greatly to the safety of our people. The Har Department. The secretary of war reports that the strength of the armv on the 30th day of Sep tember last was 25. ,78 enlisted men and 2,144 officers. The total expenditure of the depart ment for the year ending June 30, 1893, amount ed to $51,960,074.04. Ot ibis sum, $1,992,581.95 was for salaries and contingent expenses; $23,- 377,828.35 for the support of~the military estab lishment; $0,077,033. Is for miscellaneous ob jects. aud 420,518,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes ¥15,296,876 46 for river and harbor improvements and 1 3.260,141.20 for forti fications and other works of defense. The National Guard. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was on the 3ist of October of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of the army detailed for the in spection and instruction of this reserve of our military force report mat increased interest and marked progress are apparent in the dis cipline and efficiency of the organization Peace lias Reigned. Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic vio lence have called the army into service during the year, and the only active military duty re quired of it has been in the department of Texas, where violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting the warm approval of the civil and military au thorities of both countries. Keorganize the Army. The operation of wise laws and the influences of civilization constantly tending to relieve the country from the dangers of Indian hostilities, together with the increasing ability of the states, through the efficiency of the na tional guard organizations, to protect their citizens from domestic violence, lead to the suggestion that the time is fast approaching when there should be a reorganization of our army on the Hues of the present necessities of the country. This change contemplates neither increase in number nor added expense, but a redistribution of the force and an encouragement of measures tend ing to greater efficiency among the men and im provement of the service. The adoption of battalion formations for infantry regiments, the strengthening of the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller aud unnecessary posts, aud the massing of the troops at impor tant and accessible stations, all promise to pro mote the usefulness of the army, in the judg ment of army officers, with but few exceptions, the operation of the law' forbidding the reen listmenl of men after leu years service has not proved its wisdom, and while Hie arguments that led to its adoption were not without merit the experience of years constrains me to join in the recommendation for its repeal. .Progress iu t'oast Defense- It Is gratifying to note that we have begun to attain completed results in the comprehen sive scheme of seaeoast defense and fortifica tion, entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended, but the cost ot maintenance will be incon siderable as compared with the expense of construction and ordnance. At the end of the current calendar year the war depart ment will have nine 12-inch, twenty KJ-inch and thirty-four 8-inch guns, ready to be mounted on gun-lifts and carriages, aud seventy-five 12- Inch mortars. In addition to the product of the army gun factory, now' completed at Wa tervliet, the government has contracted with private parties for the purchase of one hundred guns of these cali bers, the first of which should be delivered to the department for test before July 1, 1894. 'lhe manufacture of heavy ord nance keeps pace with current needs; but to render these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet, emplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this direction, and it is desirable that con gress by adequate appropriations should pro vide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work. New Kiflo for the Army. After much preliminary work and exhaustive examination in accordance with the require ments of the law, the board appointed to select a magazine rifle of modern type, with which to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle of the in fantry service, completed its labors during the last year, and the work of manufacture is now In progress at the national armory at Spring field. It is confidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the most progressive armies of the world. National Military l‘nt k. The work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with zeal and judg ment, and Its opening will be cele brated during the coming year. Over nine square miles of the Chickamauga battlefield rv iircmynve miles of roau way have been constructed ami permanent tab lets have been placed at many historical points, wffiile the invitation to the states to mark the positions of their troops participating in the battle has been very generally accepted. The work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg battlefield is making satisfactory progress on the plans directed by the last congress. The Military Schools. The reports of the Military academy at West Point and the several schools for special in structions of officers show marked advance in education of the army and a commendable am bition among its officers to excel in the mili tary profession and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country. Under the supervision of Adj; Gen. Robert Williams, lately retired, the bureau of military information has become well established and is performing a service that will put in possession of the government in time of war most valuable information and at all times serve a purpose of great utility in keeping the army advised of the world’s progress in all matters pertaining to the art of war. The -Judiciary Department. The report of the attorney general contains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the depariment of justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as tc needed legislation on various,subjects I can not too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States commis sioners, should be abolished with as little de lay as possible. It is clearly ip the interest of the community that the business of the courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow’. The system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation ol court officials de pend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execu tion of the law and private gain, which cannot fail tc be dangerous to the rights and free dom of citizens and irrisistible temp tation, to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If iu addition to this re form another was inaugurated which would give to the United Stales commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law. In my first message to congress, dated De cember 8, 1885, 1 strongly recommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the present system. Since that time the criminal business of the federal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased. The number of criminal prosecu tions pending iu the circuit and district courts of the United States on the Ist day of July, 1885, was 5,808, of which 1,884 were for vio lations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of such prosecutions pending on the Ist day of July, 1893, was 9.-. OJ, of which 4,203 were for violation of the internal revenue laws. The expense of the United States courts, exclusive of judges' salaries, for the year ending July 1, 1885, was” .12,874,7:13 11 and for the year ending July 1, 1893, 44,528,076.87. It is. there fore. apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the federal criminal law have gained cogency and gained strength in lapse of time. Indorses the Attorney General. I also heartily join the attorney general in recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction, as has been done in many of the slates; authoriz ing writs of errors in behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an In dictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial; limiting the right of review in oases of felony punishable only by fine and im prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the construction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for tne confinement of Umted States convicts. Postal Affairs. The report of the postmaster general con tains a detailed statement of the operations of the post office department during the last fiscal year and much interesting information touch ing this important branch of the public service. The business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the con dition of the business of the country, and depression in financial affairs Inevitably and quickly rtduces the postal revenues. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual be tween the post office receipts and expenditures i i the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general s re port. Enormous Deficiency. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be but a little over 5i,500,000. It amounted, however, to more than *5,000,000. At the same lime, and under the influence of like anticipa tions, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 33, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of s-872,- Bi§.7lj but aow. In view of the actual receints and expenditures during that part of the cur* rent fiscal year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that at its close Instead of a surulus there will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The post office receipts for the last fiscal vear amounted to 75.896,933.16, and its expenditures to 481.074,004 S. This post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter was carried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 800 tons of seed* and grain from the agricultural department- The total number of post offices in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893 was 68,- 403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year Of these 3,360 were presidential, an in crease In that class of 204 over the preceding year Tile Free Delivery System. Forty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, mak ing a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free delivery on June 30. 1893. Ninety three other cities- and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is ndtessarv or justi fiable, and that it not be extended to smaller communities than are now designated. The expense of free delivery for the fiscal year end ing June 3ti. 1894. will be more than SH,oOO,uOO, aud under legislation now existing there must be a constant increase in this item of expendi ture Money Order Dullness. There were 6.401 additions to the domestic money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest increase in any year since the inauguration of the sy tern. The total number of these offices at the close of the vear was 18.434. There were 13,309,735 money orders is sued from these offices, being an increase over the preceding year ot 1,240,293 and the value of these orders amounted to ¥127,576,- 433.65, an increase of 47,509,632.58. There were also issued during the year postal notes amounting to ¥12,903,076.73. During the year 195 international money-order offices were added to those already provided, making a to tal of 2,407 in operation on June 30, 1593 The number of international money orders is sued during the year was 1,055.999, an Increase over the preceding year of 72,525, and their value was ¥16,341,837.86, an increase of $1,221,- 506.31. The number of orders paid was 300,917, an increase over the precedir : year of 13,503, aud their value was $5,283,375.7 an Increase of $94,094.83. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes for the year amounted to $153,821,348 24. The number of letters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,375.- 698, an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent. The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $337,569 30, and the messengers’ fees paid for their delivery amounted to $256,592.71. leaving a profit of $80,976 59. The Kailway Service. The railway mail service not only acids to the promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but it is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and way places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of the postal service has therefore received much attention from the postmaster general, aud. though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to agree with the postmaster general, that there is room for its further improvement. Value of Civil Service Reform. There are now connected with the post office establishment 28,324 employes who are in the classified service. The head of this great de partment gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, after an ex perience that rendei-s his Judgment on the sub ject absolutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system It would be impossible to conduct the vast busi ness Intrusted to him. i desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestions of the postmaster general relating lo a more sensible and business-like organization and a better dis tribution of responsibility in his department The Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy con tains a history of the operations of his depart ment during the past year, and exhibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which has been made in the con struction of vessels and makes a number of recommendations to which attention is espe cially invited. Cruisers Kept Kusy. During the past six montits the demands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Kica. Honduras, Argentina and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our navy, it became necessary, in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Behring sea un der the modus vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel from the .fish commission and three from the revenue marine. Progress in the construction ot new vessels has not been as rapid as was anticipated. There has been delay in the completion of un armored vessels, but for the most part they have been such as are constantly occurring even in countries having the largest experience in naval ship building. The most serious de lays, however, have been in the work upon armored ships. The trouble has been the fail ure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now, however, to have been all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. Our lUK>rganl*e<i Navy. Asa result of the experience acquired by ship builders and designers and material men, it is believed that the dates when vessels will be completed can now be estimated with rea sonable accuracy. Great guns, rapid fire guns, torpedoes and powder are being promptly sup plied. The following vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready for service: The double-turreted coast-defense monitor Miantonomoh, the double-turreted coast-de fense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charleston, Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser Detroit, the gunboats Yorktowrn, Concord, Bennington, Machias, Caatlne and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat Vesuvius. Of these the Bancroft, Machias, Detroit and Castine have been placed in commias a during the current calendar year. The following vessels are in progress of con struction: The secondrc'ass battleship Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marblehead, and the coast-defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite and Monadnock, all of which will be completed within one year; the harbor defense Ram Katahdin and the pro tected cruisers Columbia,Minneapolis,Olympia, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will bo completed prior to July 1, 1895; the first-class battleships lowa. Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be completed by February 1, 1896. and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by August 1, of that year. It is also expected that the three gun boats authorized hy the last congress will ba completed in lass than two years. A Note of Warning. Since 1888 congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more vessels, and the secretary of the navy presents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While I am dis tinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient navy I cannot refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into account the number of un finished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our treasury iu considering the propriety of an appropriation, at this lime to begin new work. The method of employing mechanical labor at nary yards through boards of labor, and making efficiency the sole test by which labor ers are employed and continued, is produc ing the best results, and the secretary is earnestly devoting himself to its development Attention is invited to the statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system. The Pens-iou Rolls. The secretary of the interior has the super vision of so many important subjects that his report is of especial value and interest. On the 30th day of June. 1893, there were on the pen sion rolls 966.012 names, an increase of 89,944 over the number on the rolls June 33, 1891 Of these there were 167 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812,5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,- 518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3,332 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebel;ion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disa bilities or deutn resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30. 1893. who were pensioned un der the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pen sions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 159,155. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123.631 and the number dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions al lowed during the year amounted to $33 756,- 549.98. This includes arrears, or the accumu lation between the time from which the al lowance of pension dates and the time of actual ly granting the certificate. Pensions for Disabilities. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related to military service, yet as a requisite to ilo benefits a disabl'.l’y must exist incapacitating applicants “from the per formance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support, ’’ The execution of this law in Its early stages does not seem to have been In accord with its true intention; but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute and since that time this construction nas been followed. This has had the effect of I.uniting the operation of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com plete examination, giving notice to the pension ers in order that they might have an opportun ity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity. Frauds Should Be Exposed. This, I understand, is the practice which has for a long time prevailed in the pension bureau, but after entering upon these recent investigations the commissioner modified th's rule so as not to allow, until after complete ex amination. interference with the pavment of a pension apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than authorized by law. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Everv name fraudu lently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposi tion upon the kindly sentiment in which pen sions have their origin. Every fraudulent pen sioner has become a bad citizen; everv false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pen sioners rob the people not only of their money but of the patriotic ' sentiment which the survivors of war. fought for the preservation of the union, ought to in -pire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their wed-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appall ing conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no means the least wrong done is to brave ,nd deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs suould not be accused of enmity or in. diffc rence to the claims of honest veterans. Enormous Expenditures. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 3d, 1893. was #156,740.467. U Tne commissioner estimates that 5165,0j0,u0j will be required to pay pensions during the year ending June 30, 1894. Indian Affairs. The condition of the Indians and their ulti mate fate are subjects which are related to a sacred duty of the government and which strongly appeal to the sense of justice and the sympathy oi our people. Our Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 16i reservations, contain ing 86.115.531 acres of land. About 110,000 of these Indians have, to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands In severalty have been allotted to many of them. Such allott rneu's have been made to 10.000 individuals dur ing the lasi fiscal year, embracing about 1 000.000 acres- The number of Indian gov ernment schools open during the year was 19\ an increase of twelve over the preceding year. Of this total 170 were on reservations, ot which seventy-three were boarding schools and ninety-seven were day schools. Twenty board ing schools and live day schools supported bv the government were not located on reserva tions. The total number of Indian children en rolled during the year as attendants of all schools wt.s 21,138, an increase of 1,231 over tUo enrollment for the previous year. h hat Is Best for the Indian. lam sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must be important fac tors in an effort to save the Indian and lead him to civilization. 1 believe, too, that the relin quishment of tribal relations and the bolding of land in severally may, in favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seems to me, how ever, that allotment of land in severalty ought to be made with great care and circumspection. If hastily done before (he Indian knows its mean ing. while yet he has little or no Idea of tilling a farm and no conception of thrift, there is great danger that a reservation life in tfibal relations may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization, instead of its independence and elevation. The solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration. >ht personal fitness of agents and their adapts ability to the peculiar duty of caring for their wards are of the utmost importance. Danger 9f Abuses. The law providing that, except in especial cases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian agents, it is hoped will prove a successful experiment. There is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims for Indian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard be provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of this description The appropriations on account of the Indian bureau for the year ending June 3J, 1894, amount to $7,954,902.89, a decrease as compared with the year preceding it of $387,131.95, Private Control of Public bauds. The vast area of land which, but a short time ago, constituted the public domain is rapidly falling into private ha nds. It is certain that in the transfer the beneficent intention of the gov ernment to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy homeseekers is often frustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who, with their families, are invited by the government to settle on the public lands, is a despicable character who ought not to be tolerated, yet it is difficult to thwart his schemes. Opening of the Strip. The recent* opening to settlement of the lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 6,500,00 acres, notwithstanding the ut most care in framing the regulations governing the selection of locations and notwithstanding the presence of United States troops, fur nished an exhibition, though perhaps in a mod ified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and the fraudulent occupation which have ac companied previous openings of public land. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these outrageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and I hope his recom mendations in that direction will he favorably considered. Preserve the forests. I especially commend to the attention of the congress the statements contained in thesecre tary’s report concerning forestry. The time has come when efficient measures should be taken for the preservation of our forests from indiscriminate and remorseless destruc tion. The report of the secretary of agriculture will he found exceedingly in teresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned in agri cultural occupations. On the 7th ot March, 1893, there were upon its payrolls 2,4 10 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demand of the people for economy in the administration of their government, the secretary has entered upon the. task ot rational ly reducing expenditures by the elimination from the payrolls of all persons not needed tor an efficient conduct of the affairs of the depart ment. Putting Down Expenses. During the first quarter of the present year the expenses of the department aggregated 1345,87676, as against $402,012.42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year ending June SO, 1893. The secretary makes apparent his in tention to continue this rate of reduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,280 than those for the present year. Among the heads of divisions in this depart ment the changes have been exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death aiid res ignations have been filled by the promotion of assistants in the same divisions. These promo tions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been in the interest of official work, but have suggested to tnose in the de partment who look for retention and promo tion that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is $850,000: the estimate for the ensuing year is $700,000. Exports of Agricultural Products. The exports of agricultural products from the United States tor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of 3*00.000,000, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent, of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1803, 526,000;000, of which Great Britain took considerably over $25,000,000. Of heel products of all kinds our total exports were $28,000,000, of which Great Britain look $24,000,- 000 Of pork producds the total exports were $84,- 000,000, of which Great Britain took $58,000,000. In breadstuff*. cotton and minar products like proportions scut to the same destination are shown. Service of Great Value. The work of the statistical division of the de partment of agriculture* deals with all that re lates to the economies of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep tbe farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the world's markets, in which the products find sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. It is there* fore of profound importance and vital concern to the farmers of the United States, who rep resent nearly one-half of our population, and also of direct interest to the whole country ihat the work of this division be efficiently performed and that the informanion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter of congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful In the year 1838 the congress appropriated $l,OlO to be taken from the patent office funds for the pur pose of collecting and distributing rare and im proved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and procuring agri cultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of agricul ture has grown to its present unwieldy and un justifiably extravagant proportions. Dnring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $66,548.61. * The remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expended in put ting them up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuit ons distribution that from this would grow large appropriations for the purpose of distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings, which are common in all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtained at low prices. Wasteful llistribution of Seeds. In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established These stations, hy their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; and yet this indis criminate and wasteful distribution of legisla tion and legislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Under the sanction of existing legislation, there was sent out from the agricultural depart ment during the laatfigeal year enough ofj3*h- J bage seen to Jnsint 19,2u# acres of land, a gum dent quantity of beans to plant 4.000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2.50 C acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7,800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,205 acres with vines, and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plants,67s acres. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was con tained in more than9.ooo.oCW packages and they were sufficient, if planted, to cover 89.596 acres of land. Should Be Abolished. In view of these facts this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit flight to be abolished. Anticipating a consum mation so manifestly in the interests of good administration more than ftOO.dOO has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this or '•he year ending June 30, i89.->, and the secretary recommends Jthat the remaining *35,000 of the esti ate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds, and that these be distributed throughout experiment sta tions. Thus the seed will be tested, and alter the test has been completed bv the experiment stations, the propagation of tne useful varieties and the rejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people. Workings of the Civil Service Law, The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increasing approval of the people of its operation are most gratifying Tne recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the employes at free de livery post offices, which has been hon estly and promptly accomplished by the commission, with the hearty cooperation of the postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system 1 am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the in calculable benefits conferred bv the civil serv ice law. not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. Popular Love of Right and Justice. The course of civil service reform in this country instructively and interestingly illus trates how strong a bold a movement gains upon our people which has underlying it a sen timent of justice and right, and which at the same time promises better administration of their government The law embodying this reform found its way to our statute book more from fear of the popular sentiment existing in its favor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators; and it has lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and not withstanding the querulous impracticability ot many self-coustituted guardians. Beneath all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it there underlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful op eration of their government, if not to its per petuity. An Inconsistency Pointed Out. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the com mission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other departments. There ought not to be such a condition in any depart ment that clerks hired to do the work there can be spared to habitually work at another place: and it does not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform that persons should be employed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devoted to en tirely different work in another department. I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the commission bo regu larly put upon its roster, and that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other depart ments be discontinued. This ought not to in crease the expense to the government, while it would certainly he more consistent and add greatlyco the efficiency of the commission. Economy is Urged. Economy in public expenditure is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must he confessed that our apparently endless re sources, the familiarity of our people with im mense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditures of public , money should in some manner be to their immediate.and personal advantage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a de generated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. At this time, when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life and when enforced economy is pressing upon the great mass of our country men, 1 desire to urge, with all the earnestness at my command, that congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympathy with the strained circum stances of our fellow citizens. The duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the people's burden of federal taxation. Tariff Reform |{c((ir I *. After a hard struggle tariff reform la directly before us. Nothing so important claims our at tention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty—an oppor tunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizns and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by the emphatic man date of the people. After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this re form, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands ot those who are solemnly pledged to it. Tor Revenue Only. If there is anything in the theory of a repre sentation in public places ot the people and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and it political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our efforts until this reform is accomplished by wise and careful legislation While wc should stauchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have grown up among us which in justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually de mand. fieduction Must lie Substantial. Manifestly, it we are to aid the people direct ly through tariff reform, one of its most obvi ous features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpa ble and substantial, see*; and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose high est function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people’s pros perity ad well-being is the removal of restric tions upon the importation ot the raw materi als necessary to our manufactures The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal legis lation, through the imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manufactures as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to out citizens. Labor's Interests Involved. The interests of labor are certainly though I indirectly involved in this feature of our tariff system The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of w-ork in mills and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress in the homes of our workingmen. Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady employment, permitted by free raw ma terials, is the most important factor in their re lation to tariff legislation. The New Measure. A measure has been prepared by the appro priate congressional committee embodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legisla tive action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe It deals with its subjects consistently and thor oughly as existing conditions permit I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation added to existing internal revenue taxation will in the near future, though perhaps not im mediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government The committee, after full consideration, and to provide against a temporary deficiency which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced la their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes de rived from certain corporate investments Will Not Disturb Business. These new assessments are not only abso lutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without.unfavorable business'disturbance when ever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. Must Subordinate Personal Desires. In my great desire for the success of this measure 1 cannot restrain the suggestion that Us success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of tr.eir willingness to subordinate personal acsirca ann ambition* to the general good. The local interests affected ay the proposed reform ate so numerous and so raried that if all are insists., apon the legisla tion embodying the reform. tnt inevitably fail. Conclusion. In conclusion, my intense feeling of respon sibility impe s me to Invoke for the manifold Interests of a generous and omflding people the most scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the ad vancement of the greatness and prosperity of aur beloved country. Grover Cleveland. Executive Mansion, Washington, December i, 1909
