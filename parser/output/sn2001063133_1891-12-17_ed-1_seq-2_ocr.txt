mm TURNER CO. HERALD. W. 0. BROWN. POMJIK— BUBLS1, SOUTH DAKOTA THE man who chops liis firewood before winter will get rid of a good deal of disagreeable experience. .1 fejSbi: A PENNSYLVANIA girl has died from tight, lacing. It is to be hoped her example will not be waisted upon her sex. ICVATIUS DONNELLY probably real izes m.w that there is a vast differ tuiv between "Ctesar's Column" and the newspaper column. "V" OUT of twenty invitations fMit a woman gives to people to call on her, there is usually not more than one that slio would really like to have accepted. ,, X'jf-i JAMES L. FLOOD is proud because he lias beaten the railroad record on the transcontinental trip, hut less wealthy men are modestly content" with heating the railroads. N RUSSIA has made a contract for 2.000.000 rifles to be ready in 1894. Tli is gives inventors at least two years to discover a new engine of death that shall make" this variety of ritlc cbsoletc. THERE is no one in the world so seilish as the man with a trouble he thinks no one is too busy to listen to the story of his woes, and that every man he meets should stop and weep with him. GAIL HAMILTON is surprised at the lack of response to her ill-judged ap peal in behalf of Mrs. Maybrick, but the public has learned to be pretty thoroughly distrustful of anything which Gail Hamilton champions. SOME too officious Sabbatarians in Pittsburg propose to arrest every newspaper man they find working on Sunday. It appears that in getting rid of her smoke Pittsburg has not wholly freed herself of pestiferous nuisances. SOME sour bachelor has written a hook entitled "Don't Marry." It is a great book to have lying on club-room tables, for the life of the club is in man's indifference to home ties, but it will prove a very unpopular work for the parlor. RICHES do not seem to lengthen life. The man who is so rich he can go North in summer and South in winter, does not live any longer than the poor fellow who has to stay at home and shiver or sweat with every change of weather. AN Illinois man has invented an automatic telephone exchange, and the „dear girls who continually chew gum, never answer your rings and forever ?.nd ever cut you off in the midst of a conversation, must go. It is to be hoped that this automatic exchange is not a fake. A SNAKE in the grass has been dis covered to the cigarette smoker. An insect that bores into the cigarette and lays an egg causes the trouble. The worm that results eats the tobac co and virtually poisons the cigarette. The value of this discovery should not be discounted because a St. Louis man makes it. MR. HAGEMAN, a merchant of Jaz ajagjara, Guatemala, says that the revolutions against President Barillas are "small affairs" and that only two men of Jazajagjara were killed in the last one. If either, or both of these men were guilty of christening Mr. Hageman's town, the revolution may not have been wholly unsuccessful. 

EVERYTHING else in the world may fail, but this never will: No man ever injured his neighbor without be ing injured in turn for it. It is the law of retribution. Don't think you will escape it. The longer it is de layed the greater your punishment will be. Fear this law and. you will have in your heart all that there is to charity, faith and religion. IT is estimated that 3,500,000 steel pens are consumed daily. It is in teresting to think what they do. For instance, they make love, write gush ing poetry, scrape out the briefs in a breach of promise suit, cut and thrust at reputation, scratch outreal alistic novels and political editorials, chronicle sensations, puff this and be little that, and, in short, do more to make and break, to save and destroy, to civilize and degrade the human race than anything else under the sun. A ST. LOUIS physician has discov ered bugs in cigarettes He says the hug poisons the cigarette. The dic tum will probably not spoil the de mand for the article, but it will fur nish the perishing dude with a re mark for his part of a little street colloquy. "Wot's eatin' yer?" the gamin will flippantly inquire. "A coleopterous insect," the dude will answer, with a faint flourish of cane and monocle. Then the gamin should wilt. A NEW ORLEANS teller has beaten the records as a bank robber. Ac cording to his confession, his thefts have been going on for sixteen years, and amount to 8190,000. There was a simplicity about his methods, too, that is refreshing. In making up packages of bills he put tens in place of hundreds, and invested the differ ence in wild-cat speculation. Such a story provokes the reflection that a bank where such irregularities could be carried on for sixteen years de serves to lose the money. MASCOUTAII, 111., should take move newspapers and fewer chances. To learn in one terrifying dispatch from that town that "shell-workers" se cured about $2,000 from farmers who came to the circu-i, and that llfty Mascoutah people dropped $5,000 into the treasury of a "benevolent organ ization which promised to give $100 for the use of $50 for one year is like ly to awaken some suspicion as to the entire sanity of the folks thereabouts. One-half that sum expended for newspapers which teach people how to be good shun the s&irjpej would save Mascoutali many thousand dollars annually. MMM lf#§P SPAIN, as the mother country of the Spanish republics of Central and South America, where revolution is a condition not a theory, is still tho scene of plots and counterplots look ing to the overthrow of monarchy. No doubt the government of a great kingdom by a queen-regent in the in terest of a child, around whom al) the ancient flummeries are centered, is a frying-pan state of affairs but, judging from experiences in this hem isphere, the Spanish republic is not a government which makes for stability, pea?e and good order any more than the Spanish monarchy. A KANSAS CITY judge has set a precedent which will be hailed with glee by litigants and particularly by witnesses. When one of the lawyers in a divorce case began to browbeat and bully a witness, the judge inter posed with this quiet remark: "Gen tlemen, if any one is unjustly in sulted in this court-room, I will not tine him for resenting it. This court will not further protect a man who gives an insult." A very Daniel come to judgment is that judge. In his court the favorite practice of bolstering up a bad case by bullying the witnesses for the other side is likely to become unpopular. 

THAT compulsory education as now administered is a failure is not to be doubted by any one who will take the trouble to investigate, and that it will always be in a certain sense a failure is equally certain, and for ob vious reasons. The children of pov erty and crime have had all the nat urally fine sensibilities of childhood blunted by hardship and suffering, and early become materialists. Tha world to them is a place in which they see only the struggle against hunger and the elements, and they are skeptical concerning education, and see in the truant officer only an enemy who would rob them of their liberty to no substantial purpose. WHEN the grippe epidemic made its second appearance last year, the general conclusion reached among physicians was that the affliction had become chronic. Now anew problem presents itself as to the prevention or cure of prolonged and unnatural sleep, various cases of which have puzzled the medical fraternity during the present year. The latest reported is that of a Munith (Mich.) school teacher who has been slumbering for over 130 days. As in the majority of cases of this kind, the sleeper enjoyed good health previous to her lengthy nap, but is now only able to take liquid nourishment, and is rapidly wasting away. Will not the breth ren of the medical profession get their heads together and find a means of awakening those thus overcome by this sleep unto death? THE child of the streets loves the freedom of his life, and it is hard to wean him from it, and that end can never be accomplished by harsh meas ures. Taken from his roving life and set in the school-room among chil dren who enjoy parental care and the co:-* forte of a home, he feels himself a pariah, and revenges himself upon his tsrmentors, the truant officers and the teachers, whom he usually hates with an abiding hatred, by demoraliz ing all the children that come in con tact with him, and imparting to them far more of evil than he imbibes of good from the instruction and associ ations of the school. If placed in a reformatory he still seems an outcast, and there is no incentive to improve ment, and no substantial effect is at tained in educating him. The first step in the eduation of neglected children should be in the direction of manual training. While an ignorant lad might not appreciate the im portance of learning to read and write, he knows by observation that manual dexterity will enable him to earn money. While he is learning to use his hand and brain in the cruder work of manual training, he is at tho same time being prepared for that mental training which is to make him an intelligent workman. Marvels of Bigness. It is commonly supposed that America possesses the tallest trees in the world, but that is not the case. Her highest specimen is said to be a sequoia gigantea near Stockton, Cal ifornia, 325 feet in height, and this is surpassed by two eucalyptus trees in Victoria, Australia, which reach 435 and 450 feet respectively. But we can console ourselves with the knowl-1 edge that we have, at any rate, the most elevated lake in the world— Green Lake, Colorado, 10,252 feet above sea level and in some places 300 feet deep the largest single pane of glass, 180 by 104 inches, made In Marseilles, France, and set in a store front in Cincinnati, Ohio and the largest coil spring ever rolled—a steel spring 6 inches wide, 1-4 Inch thick and 310 feet long, made at Al leghany City, Penn., and after all the large European iron works had declined the order. And Harper's Young People, which names these among other marvels of bigness, des cribes also a miracle of smallness— the writing of 4,100 words on the blank side of a postal card, by John J. Taylor, of Streator, 111. It was done without artificial aid, and must have taxed the skill of the performer as much as the statement does the credulity of the reader. A Hugo Magnet. According to the recent investiga tions of Prof. Frank H. Bigelow, the vast Held of sunlight through which the earth careers in its annual mo tion around the center of the solar system is also a field of magnetic force radiated from the sun, and tho effects arising from the motion of the earth through it suffice to account not only for the vibrations of the magnetic needle but also for the per manent magnetic condition of the globe. This discovery—for it seems most probable that further investigations will confirm it as a genuine discovery —is in accordance with the recent conclusions of Professor Hertz as to the intimate relations of light and electricity. It is a very impressive picture which science is thus beginning to present to us of the solar system— the sun and its family of planets —acting as a great magnetic system, wherein the impulses arising at the center are communicated outward In every direction to bodies hundreds of millions of miles away.

WORLD'S DOINGS. Happenings of a Weeks 7,in Condensed Form. GOULD CAUGIiT SHORT. HE MAY LOSE MILLIONS ON STOCKS. Ha or Bis Relatives ou tlie Short Side of the Market at the Wrong Time—Vau dorbllt Stooks Buoyant While tho Gould Securities Are Depressed. The Withering Touch of the Wizard. THE buoyancy of the Vanderbilt stocks and the exceptional depression of the Gould securities have given rise to the expression that there is some thing like a speculative duel in progress between these two interests. It is uni versally conceded that the. Vanderbilts have always endeavored to build up the properties in which they are interested, and that they never in any circum stances have used any of their proper ties as a "bear club" to knock down prices of stocks. It is equally known that Mr. Gould has never 1 hold of a property that did pot wi at his touch. Ills wholo career Erie to Wabash bears eloquent mony to this, and tho climax is Dished by Missouri Pacific. This erty, which some time ago was said be paying 7 per cent, and earning has been so built up under the Gc management that it is now payingnoth ing and selling down in the fifties. Even the Western Union Telegraph Company, at his magic touch, although paying its dividends, is selling low dowu in the eighties, Tho pronounced weak ness of tho properties in which Mr. Gould is interested, while the general market is advancing, give3 color to the popular rumor that his sons and other followers are heavily short of stocks. Gossip says that they are borrowing about 100,000 shares in London and as many In this country. tho well taken itlior from testi fur- prop to .. 14, Goula THE ILLINOIS CROPS. Beports to the State Board on Corn, Wheat and Other Grains. THE reports of the State Board of Agriculture show the acreage of corn this year was 5,754,000 acros, and an average yield of 37% bushels per acre, or a total of 215,395,000 bushels. In the northern or southern divisions the average yield is 50 per cent, over last year, and in the central division 25 per cent! The quality is much better than in former years the average market price paid at local warehouses and rail way stations is 38 cents, or 7 cents less than tho average last year. The total area seeded in winter wheat this fall was 2 per cent, larger than last year. In the northern part of the State the area is less. Wheat is not in a good condition and is about 80 to 85 per cent, seasonable average. Thirty Lives Lost. THE most serious of all the disasters in tho recent storm off the English coast was tho wreck of the British ship Entrekin off Ramsgate in County Kent. Thirty lives were lost, every person ex cept the apprentice boy being drowned. After the Entrekir. struck, a part of the crew succeeded in launching a boat and got clear of the ship. They wero almost immediately thrown ihto the sea by the swamping of the boat. A boy was the only one of those remaining on board the ship who escaped. What Muddled worcross' Brain. ACCORDING to the statements of the intimate friends of Norcross, the man who threw the dynamite bomb at Rus sell Sage, his brain has been affected by the excessive and regular use of cam phor, alum and sulphur, which he as serted had a great effect in keeping a man in excellent health. A Body Turned to Stone. A REMABKABI.E discovery has been made at Nashville, Ohio, when the body of Mrs. Mary Reynolds, who died there some years ago, was disinterred. The body was found to have petrified and weighed nearly 800 pounds. IN THE EAST. THE comptroller of the currency has called for a report of the condition of national banks at the close of business Wednesday, December 2. THE receipts from customs at New York the first ten days of this month were nearly 81,000,000 less than for the corresponding period last year. THE farmers of Indiana are preparing to demand of the ne.\t Legislature that a law bo enacted reducing the Stai.e rate of railroad fare to 2 cents a mile. ONE of the most interesting archico logical discoveries on record is made in Ohio. It indicates that the mound builders were closely allied to the Az tecs. ATTORNEY GENEKAT, MII.I.ER has de termined to test the right of railways to issue free passes. He will shortly bring suit against one New England railroad as a test case. THE not gold holdings of the Treasury Department are $131,125,587, an in crease of about 52,000,000 since the first of the month, and an increase of nearly $14,000,000 since June last. THE Executive Committee of the Na tional Democratic Committee has de cided to call a meeting of the National Committee at Washington on the 21st of next January to decide upon the time and place for holding the Democratic National Convention. A COLLISION occurred at Mountain Glenn, near Murphysboro, 111., on the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, between freight and construction trains. Three per sons, Engineer Flippen, Simon Olson, and Jo Miller, were killed outright, one fatally and eight badly injured. HENRY L. NORCROSS, a Boston note broker, has been missing since the date of the tragedy in the office of Russell Sago, in New York City, and it was generally believed that he was one of the victims of a railway accident which occurred about tho same time. New York dotectives, however, discovered a clue and went to Boston to try to iden tify the missing man as the mysterious bomb thrower. The detectives took with them a trousers button and a por tion of the trousers worn by tho bomb thrower, as well as a piece of his coat and portions of his underclothing. These were taken to the Norcross res idence and the underclothing positively identified by Mrs. Norcross as belonging to her husband. On the trousers of the dead man were buttons bearing the print, "Brooks, Tailor, Boston." The The pieces of clothing were taken to Mr. Brooks' store and that merch ant positively stated that the firm had made a coat for Henry L. Norcross of tho cloth and also a pair of trousers of the same cloth as the other piece furnishod by tho detectives. The but ton was also identified as a peculiar one used by this tailoring house. It is now believed that the identification of the bomb thrower has been fully estab lished. THE total exports of breadstuffs dur ing the month of November readied $24,588,979. The increase over Novem ber, 1890, was 81C.90C.975. The increase was largely in wheat, corn, barley, oats and rye. The principal exports for No vember, 1891, were: Corn, 2,02C,128 bushels, worth $1,334,811 rye, 942,150 bushels, worth 8940,084 wheat, 14,1:55, 780 bushels, worth $15,710,093 wheat flour, 1,143,602 barrels, worth $5,749, 098 oats, 1,070,141 bushels, worth $470, 047. Corn shows an increase of 767,542 bushels, and in value $5£0,802, over No vember, 1890. Rye shows an increase of 909,381 bushols, and in value 8017, 412. Wheat shows ah increase of 11, 556,350 bushels, in value $12,821,549. Wheat flour shows an increase of 350, 552 barrels, in value 51,873,030. The increase in oats was 1,041,369 -bushels' and of §457,087 in value. The shipments of cotton during the month of Novem ber were .1,073,349 bales, of tha value of 848,207,095. This is an increase over November a year ago of about 83,500,000. Tho total exports of pro visions. beef and hog products wero S9,441,903. This is a small increaso over November, 1890. The total ship ments for November of breadstuffs, mineral oils, cotton and provisions were of the value of §37,108,409. This is. an incroaso over October, 1391, when" ex ports of these products were unparal leled in the history of the government. The increaso isS0,120,l?l. The exports of grain and flour from the United States to supply the markets of Europe have already up to this date exceeded 100,000.000 bushels. Freight rates on tho ocean have gono down nearly 5 cents a bushel, but still, owing to tho great demand, the ocean rates are nearly double what they were a year ago. IT begins to look like a consolidation will be effected between tho National league and the American association, and a consolidated twelvo club league will supply tho demand for the national game the coming soason.1 IN THE WEST. SHERIFF JONF.S and Deputy C. IT. Thompson have arrived at Miles City Mont., with one of two Indians they arj rested at Cheyenne Agency for killing cattle. Another prisoner escaped by jumping from a buekboard and making for cover. Ho readied the hills, though fired at several times. On the roadj subsequently the sheriff was overtaken by two Indian polico with a messago from Agent Tully that a number of braves had gone to the hills "with the. fugitive and sent word that they would fight and that an attack on the* agency could bo expected at any time. Tully sent a dispatch to tho command ing officer at Fort lveogh, asking him to send troops, as an uprising is inevitable The Commander telegraphed depart ment headquarters at St. Paul, and or ders wero issued from there to send troops from Fort Keogh to Cheyenne Agency. Since the order of tho general land oflico allowing settlers who claimed prior rights on the reservation to make final proofs, trouble has been feared. Many settlers were in Miles City last week making final entries. The Indians heard of this and will use all means to drive the settlers from the reservation. No trouble is feared in army headquar ters at Chicago, where it is thought thq danger of an uprising is overestimated. A MEETING of holders of mortgages assigned by tho Nebraska Kansas Farm Loan Company, residing in this vicinity, has been held at Ilalston, N. Y., to consider what action to take to ascertain the validity of such mort gages, and the present status of such liens. The company has its office in Red Cloud, Neb., and Albany, N. Y., and obtained money from parties in this section and sent it West for investment in farm mortgages, which it took from the settlors at 10 per cent, per annum and assigned them to their patrons, tho latter to roceivo 7 per cent. About 8400,000 was thus placed in the hands of the company for investment. THE Minnesota Farmers' Alliance, through Its leaders, has issued another "Hold your wheat" circular. It is urn gent in its demand that all farmers keep their grain in their bins. It says Russia has reached its limit in supply ing its own people wit'h grain, and that India can export almost no more. It gives the exporting capacity of the, United States at 140,000,000 bushels^ more than last year, which falls 40,000, 000 bushels short of supplying the world's deficit. This 140,000,000 bush els it says would supply Europe with bread only nineteen and one-half days. 

TWENTY-ONE State delegations in tho World's Fair convention at Chicago voted for a resolution asking Congress to appropriate $5,000,000 for the exposi tion. The five other State delegations that have not authority to vote on such questions put themselves on record in dividually in favor of the resolution. IN Kansas City Mrs. Lizzie Dennie, alias Smith, was held to await the ac tion of the grand jury on the charge of kidnaping little "Junior" Beats. Bail was fixed at 35,000. The hearing of Albert King, charged with being an ac complice, was continued to Decem ber 22. Gov MERRIAM has issued a circular letter of many thousand copies, which will be mailed throughout Minnesota, setting forth the terrible destitution in Russia, and asking the people to do all in their power to mitigate the sufferings of these poor starving Russians. THE north bound passenger train on the Santa Fe rolled down a steep em bankment near Paul's Valley, Texas A number of passengers were seriously injured. JOHN CUDAIIV, the Chicago packer, has purchased land in Louisville, Ivy., and will erect a packing house and stock yards. THE grip is epidemic in Denver. The physicians assert that no less than 750 cases are now being treated. STRIKING miners at Crested Butte, Col., defied the officers and seven were mortally shot. THE SOUTHERN SUMMARY. ONE of the most remarkable cases that has ever come to light in the State of South Carolina has developed in tho State Supreme Court, and as a result the necks of ten negroes under sentenco of death in Laurens County for tin: mur der of Thornton Nance some months ago will be saved. They were sentenced to liarig October 2t last, but their attor neys appealed to tho Supremo Court, and the notion was to suspend tho hear ing in the Supreme Court and transfer it- back to tho Ciruit Court. Tho ground of this motion was the' confession of an other negro, Henry Super, who was re cently arrested, to the effect that ho alone was tho murderer. His affidavit stated substantially that ho was at the, Pitts church on the night of the mur der that shortly after tho meeting ho started home, and when about a quar ter of a mile from tho church he was overtaken and assaulted by Nance. Then and there, he says, ho shot Nance and killed him. He says he is not re lated to any of tho condemned men, but feels that it is his duty to confess it in order that innocent men may not suffer by him. He says further that any state ment or statements that other persons were implicated in the killing but him self is false, and concludes his affidavit with the statement that when the time comes for his trial for his life he will give all the details and show that there was absolutely no conspiracy. He gave this affidavit to the lawyers to be used as they might think advisable for tho sake of humanity. Tlio Supreme Court de cided the motion, and sent- the caso back to the Circuit Court for rehearing. IT is announced that the Supremo Court of Texas has decided the alien land law unconstitutional. Tho news is recoived with the greatest satisfac tion in business, labor and other circles. The law hardly had a friend in Texas even those who voted for it In the Leg islature saying they were duped as to its effects upon finances and trade. REPRESENTATIVE ENI.OE, of Tennc see, is determined to offer a resolution looking to tho further investigation of Commissioner Raum's administration of the Pension Bureau, and will seek tho appointment of a secret committee of inquiry. BY the burning of two buildings at Louisville, Ivy., sixteen persons lost their lives. FOREIGN JOTTINGS. •THE elections for members of tho Nor wegian Parliament, which began in ^October,last, have been completes! and liavo resultoii in a great victory for tho ^Liberal Radical party of !he Left. Of •a, total of 114 members. 03 are of tho Left, 37 of the Right, and 14 Moderates. It is now bolieved that the relations be tween Norway and Sweden, which since 1S14 have formed the Scandinavian union, may experience a still greater tension than during the last few. years. Norway has always piotested against her exclusion from tho direction of the foreign policy of the Union, and wants a Norwegian to be made Minister o/ Foreign Affairs, which oflice lias alwajz been tilled by a Swede. A strong iigl I will now bo made to bring about thij result. Till' agrarian papers in Germany con tinue their endeavors to keep up tli fiction that American pork is diseased, Dr. Braekbusch, the noted scientist, has made public the results of examina tions of 3,000 specimens of American pork. Dr. Braekbusch found traces o' trichina in about 23-* per cent, of the specimens which passed through lis hands. He experimented with cr.ts ant' dogs, trying to infect them bv fcedin them with diseased meat, but failed en tirely. This the doctor considers posi tive proof that the trichina survive bu! a short time the death of the infeclej animal. He holds that American pork, even of poor quality, is |.orfectly harm less when it reaches Germany. THE terms of the reciprocity arrange ments between the United States and Germany have just been made public and will go into effect at the close of January next. The trade basis is sub stantially the same as adopted in the agreements of Germany with Italy and Austria, and this country is thus place by the land of the Kaiser on a par with its most favored nations. These con cessions do not by any means amount to a letting in of cur produce free by Germany. The new duties amount to nearly 20 cents per bushel ou wheat, 9% cents on corn, and i% cents per pound on meats, including those cut from tho hog. But it is believed these figures are not prohibitive. REPORTS.-of the late storms in Europe and Asia bring many stories of wreck and disaster. Along the coast tho small crafts, fishing boats, and vessels engaged in the coastwise trade are tho principal sufferers. Many of these ves sels have been unable to claw off shor» and have been dashed upon the beaches, where heavy seas have scon broken them up. A dispatch from Singapore, China, states that a severe gale pre vailed at Hongkong Decefnber 4. A large number of Chinese vessels of all descriptions were destroyed and hun dreds of Chinese sailors ami laborers en gaged about the harbor were drowned. SKNOI: ANTONIO MATTA, Chilean Min ister of Foreign Affairs, has prepared for distribution among tlie Chilean lega tions in Europe and America, a circular letter giving Chili's side of the difficulty with the United States growing out of the Baltimore trouble. He denies that there was any concerted attack on American sailors, says the deaths were the result of a drunken quarrel, aud assails Mr. Fgan. THE situation in the State of Rio Ja neiro is becoming critical. The oppos ing forces are arming themselves. Gov. Portello holds Nictlieroy. The insur gents have established a provisional government and selected Karahoa as tho capital. Hiev are organizing foi an attack on Nictlieroy. The govern ment is apathetic. THE London Chronicle's Shanghai correspondent telegraphs that the rebels met a complete defeat. This has been confirmed. Eleven hundred rebels were slaughtered on the field, and those' which were overtaken and captured were immediately executed. Martial law has been proclaimed throughout Manehoria. IN an address in the German Reich stag Chancellor Von Caprivi advised the countries of Europe to preserve their independence against America, and said that for this purpose they must unite together. The commercial treaties just concluded by tile triple alliance give a sure guarantee of the future. AT a recent meeting of miners in, Belgium a resolution was adopted in' favor of universal suffrage. '1 ho men declared that if the next constituent as sembly which is to revise the constitu tion does not concede universal suffrage the Labor party will reconsider tlie question of a general strike. JL'.ST'.N" MCCARTHY, as sole surviving trustee of the Paris fund, lias been served with a writ by the members of the Parncllite Irish parliamentary-party, who request the removal of McCarthy from the trusteeship and-pray for the appointment of proper trustees. A DISPATCH from 1'ekin states that the recent victories of the imperial troops sent against the rebels in Mon golia have brought the insurrection to an end. Forty-two insurgents who had a hand in the mnrderof Christians have been beheaded atTakow. AFFAIRS in Brazil continue critical. A conflict has occurred at .San Paulo between the government troops and in surgents. The advices are not clear as to which side won the victory, but it is reported that ten men were killed. THE British rural conference, in ses sion at London, denounced the heredi tary privileges of landlordism and churchism, and adopt, as a motto to be used at the coming el ctions, "Down with Church and Landlord."' THR Russian government will advance money to peasants in the famine stricken districts who prove that they possess •animals, the object being to prevent a wholesale slaughter of animals. THE Russian press dilates on the ne cessity for the Franco-Russian treaty .being made to embrace other countries if possible, in onb to counteract the effoct of the zollvercin WHII.F. Lieut. Mansfield was making •a balloon ascension at Bombay, India, the balloon collapsed in mid-air and the aeronaut fell a distance of 400 feet and was crushed to death.

Heading of the message closed at 1:43, hav ing consumed exactly an hour and a half. It was listened to throughout with close in terest. The message was ordered to be laid on the table and printed and the Senate adjourned. On the 9th in the House, after an ap proval of tho journal, a recess was taken to await the President's message. After the recess the messago was received and read by the clerk. The reading of tho annual messago in the House never receives much .attention and the last one proved no excep tion to tho general rule. On completion of the reading tho message was referred to committee of the whole and ordered printed. Mr Millar, of Wisconsin, offered a resolu tion requesting the Speaker in appointing tho committees to apportion the satno among the several States and Territories according to the population, and to appoint at least oue chairman from each Statu and Territory.

WAITING FOR COMMITTEES. Very little legislative business is expected before the holiday recess. It has come to be generally understood that while the time before the holiday recess in the long session may be employed in perfecting the organizat ou of tiie two brandies of Con gress, little can be attempted with profit in the line of legislation. Many Senators and Representatives, assuming that the t-e icess will begin before the end of the week, have already made arrangements to leave Washington in a few days. The Introduction of bills and resolutions not presented in the rush iast week, a speech by Senator Turpie on the subject of the election of Senators by a direct vote of the people, and one by Senator Stewart on free silver coinage, together with such re sponses as they may elicit, will probably compose tho record of the week in the Senate. A proposition has been broached that Congress adjourn on Friday, the 1stli. to Monday, January 4. It is believed that until the committee organization nothing can be accomplished by continuing t!u\ nominal sessions of the House into tlui following week before taking the usual re cess. Tho Speaker has been industriously enr gaged in tho work preliminary to the ap pointment of committees, but tiie experi ence of the past warrants the belief that it Is impracticable to complete them in time for announcement before New Year. The Committee on Rules may be announced earlier in order that its members may pro ceed to formulato rules for the Fifty-second House, and submit them for consideration immediately upon reassembling after the holidays. ESTIMATES OF THE MON'KY NEEDED. A comparative statement of the estimates of the appropriations needed for tho next fiscal year, with an estimate on tiie appro priations for tho current fiscal year, lias been prepared by the clerks to the Housj and Senate Committees on appropriations. It shows an excess in the estimates uf the /regular appropriations for the fiscal year beginning July, 1S92, of S9,f22,S"2, as com pared with the estimates a yoar ago for tho current fiscal year. Similar estimates! of ,tlie permanent annual appropriations show reduction of S(i22,!l28. A comparison of •tho estimates for tho next, fiscal year with 'the estimates a year ago, according to the •several heads under which the appropria tions ate made, is: Agricultural, $3,.'iG0,995 for tiie next fiscal year, an Increase of $o4S.!iU_', though only ,S3ii2,842 in excess of the current year's ap propriations. Tii!i is due to the fact that to last year's estimates as submitted, SsSl). 753 heretofore appropriated for under tho •War Department was added to tho agricul tural appropriation bill on account of tho transfer of the weather bureau. Army, §25,049,207, an increaso of SI3:i,fiG2. Diplomatic and consular, S2,13S.4()!i, an increase of $195,801. District of Columbia, S5.002,125, an in crease of $151,910.

The appropriations for tho current year, however, exceeding last year's esti mates by §7,782.377, on account of tiie rati fication in the appropriation bill of several ludian treaties, and the payment of the claims of the Choctaw and Chickasaw na tions.

THE COAL FIELDS. & The Strike May Terminate Within a Week iiiicl It Muy l. ist Far lnlo tho Spring— Tho .Men Say Nothing Short of Starva tion Will Iniluno a Surrender. Hio Situation Is Serious. From the outlook it is impossible to ay what will come of the strike in the the Urazil, Ind., toal fields. It may terminate within a week, and it may last all winter and far into tlie spring. Neither tho operat rs nor tho miners have mado a move toward settlement. Both are determined and silent. The miners say nothing short of starvation will drive them in'.o the mines, aud thero is little prospect of such an emergency in the near future. On the oth haiid tho operator.--, t'l ono or two excep tions, have signed an agreement to allow their p'ants to stand idle until tho spring rather than II ake the increase demanded by the nu n. A rather sensational rumor has l-.een circulated in Torre Haute and Brazil for sorno days, and if it should turn out to be true wi.l undoubtedly prevent an immediate settlement. It that the Hig Four road is using secret^ influences to prolong tho strike. f' There is one feature in the strike which looks favorable to the men. It is the jealousy which exists between the soft coal operators and the block ai operators. They are for tho present pulling together, but a separation may occur at anv time, in thb event tho men may be victorious J. H. .YcCIel land, general manager for tho Brazil Block CVal Company, denied that such a jealousy existed, but some of tiie soft coal men say it does Tlio minors deprecate lawlessness, and iuiet prevails everywhere. Nothing like agitation exists. The men are at home with their families, waiting with a dogged persistence for tho oporators to give in. Things a1 out the mines looked gloomy to a recent visitor, but in most of tho cottages there was an ap pearanco of thrift, and the squalor and dirt one expects to find in mining ham-', lets wa-i want ng. Nothing of the an-,,-4 archistic order was.found. The one orj^ two acts of violence which have ocjurredS were deno'iimcd. Tho miners eallze'*""" that to win they must maintain tho respect of the public. In tlio strike of two years ago," said or.e, "wo held out seven months, and not ono of us was arrested L.r lawlessness.' We have not changod, but away back in the '70s an attempt was made by the op perators to run in a lot of foreigners and then there was a riot. Tho outsiders had to go Under simi ar circumstances vio'ence might o.-cur." Tlio operators all say no attempt will be mado to import labor. They are will-, ing to test the endurance of the miners.
