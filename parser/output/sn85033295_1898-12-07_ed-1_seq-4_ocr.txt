Address The Watertown Republican, Watertown, Wisconsin. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 1898. At the opening of congress Monday all the Wisconsin members were in their seats except Representative Babcock, who is in the state fixing up his fences for tbe senatorship. The Milwaukee wheat market yes terday was weak, and closed at 66%c for No. 1 and for No. 2 North ern, Flour was unchanged. Barley closed at 4.9}4c, rye at 53c, corn at 32%c, and oats at 58%c. Hogs were weak, ranging at $3.30@53.45 'for packing grades. The president’s message, delivered to congress Monday, is generally con sidered a most valuable historical document. It gives a complete re sume of the late war and deals ably with other public questions. How ever, some expected suggestions as to the expansion matters were left un said. We are forced to the conclusion that The Waukesha Freeman has no '‘sporting” editor. Andy O’Dea has gone to Harvard not as a student, but as an ‘‘instructor.” He will teach the boys how to row, and what ever his intellectual attainments may be, they have nothing to do with Lis professional oarsmanship. Some of the railwaj 7 companies have signified their intention of dis tributing annual passes to Wiscon sin legislators the same as heretofore. If the lawmakers have the slightest regard for the platform pledges of their parties they will return tbe passes to thecorapanies at once. No honest man could do otherwise. C. W. Fraser, of Waukesha, is a candidate for chief clerk of the assem bly. He appears to haveetrongsup port throughout thestate and is high ly spoken of by those who know him. It is said he is thoroughly competent, tor the place. Perhaps it might be well to pass the plums around this win ter, instead of electing the same old crowd to the legislative positions. Congressman Sauerhering has ex pressed the intention of having the Dodge county pension board reorgan ized this winter. He says thepresent board is not doing justice to the old soldiers, not a single applicant hav ing thus far been able to secure the board’s endorsement. He further claims that there is but one member who rightly considers the matter of a soldier’s disabilities. He wants a board that will do justice to those who deserve pensions.

Where an election is not close little interest is taken in official returns; but this year, owing to the fight made on the head of the Republican ticket, the official returns have been anxious ly looked for to settle the question as to how much Governor Scofield ran behind the other candidates on his ticket. The official count has been completed and the fact is as certained. Governor Scofield’s total vote was 173,137 and that of the Democratic candidate for governor, Judge Sawyer, 135,335 —leaving Scofield’s plurality 37,802. The total voce for the other candi dates on the Republican ticket was as follows: Jesse Stone, lieutenant-governor, 180,043. W. H. Froelich, secretary of state, 180,438. J. O. Davidson, state treasurer, 180,792. E. R. Hicks, attorney general, 180,073. L. D. Harvey, state superintend ent, 180,339. G. L. Rice, railroad commissioner* 180,106. Emil Giljohan, insurance commis sioner, 180,019. Thus it will be seen that Governor Scofield’s vote fell behind that of the candidate for lieutenant-governor, 6,906. Governor Scofield’s vote fell behind the average vote cast for the state officers, excluding that cast for gover nor, 7,121. Governor Scofie d’s vote fell behind the average vote for state officers, in cluding the vote cast for governor, 6,231. A reference to the complete returns shows that about one-third of the cut on the head of the Republican ticket came from Dane county and Milwaukee county. Washington Letter. I From our Regular Correspondent.! Washington, December 2, 1898. President McKinley is confident that the senate will promptly ratify the treaty of peace with Spain. The treaty will he sent to the senate at the earliest possible moment, but there are formalities that may delay its being sent until after the Christ mas recess. As three of the Ameri can peace commissioners are mem bers of the senate committee on foreign relations, it is expected that the treaty will be quickly reported to the senate from that committee, with the recommendation that it he rati fied. The treaty does not involve the question of a form ofgovernment for the Philippines, nor does it bind this government to keeping them per manently, therefore Senator Lodge was correct when he said: “Under the terms of the agreement those op posing the ratification of the treaty must take the uncomfortable posi tion of opposing a treaty of peace on the ground that the United State* is getting too much from Spain.” President McKinley has been assured by a number of senators that they will vote for the ratification of the tiear.y, although they are not pre pared to commit themselves in favor of permanently retaining the Philip pines. That is a question there is plenty of time to consider; upon which the president has not yet com mitted himself, and about which much more will he known after we have run the islands under a military government for a time. If congress acts as promptly as it is expected to do on the bill provid ing tor an increase of the regular army to 100,000 men, it is not likely that any of the volunteers will be sent to Cuba. Nearly every senator and representative who has come to Washington has called at the war department to request that some regiment of volunteers be mustered out because the men while willing to fight are not willing to remain in the army to perform garrison duty. The president is anxious to meet the wishes of the men, but it cannot be fully done until congress provides for the increase in the regular army. Already orders have been issued to send about 6,000 regulars to Manila, in order that some cf the volunteers may be brought home. Representative DanforL of Ohio, is one of the millions who oelieve in our ability* to meet eyery responsi bility which confronts us, whether it be assumed from choice or from a sense of duty and humanity. He said on the subject: “That the Ameri can people are competent to own and manage the territory wrested from Spain is in the nature of a self evident proposition. Mr. Carnegie is making more fuss by the expression of his fears as to our competency than anybody else, and I suspect that if Mr. Carnegie’s doubt were analyzed it would be found that his anti-expansion views grow out of his dislike to seeing England, Germany, France, et al, admitted to equal trade privileges with the United States in the Philippines. If he could get a shade of advantage for the sale of his steel products over these, I think, he would be as good an imperialist as any.” This week President and Mrs. Mc- Kinley were presented by J. D. Robin son, secretary of the Libby Glass com pany, of Toledo,|Ohio,with the largest cut glass punch bowl ever made. Mr. Robinson is a Democrat, but a strong admirer of President McKin ley’s policy, and his personal friend. The punch bowl is cut to represent the stars and stripes, and on the sides are six shields, each with thirteen stars to represent the origi nal states of the union. Scattered around the bowl are forty-five large stars to represent the states now in the union. The president has several reasons for appreciating this splendid cift, not the least of which is that it is American-made and a constant re minder that the establishment of the industry of cutting glass in the United States which opponents of the Republican party once declared to be an impossibility, and which now rivals both iti extent and work manship that produced by any country on earth, was the direct re sult of Republican efforts. One of the first results of American possession of the Philippines will be the squelching of Aguinaldo and his pinchback government and the dis bandment of his army. Officials do not anticipate that any trouble will follow when Aguinaldo is ordered to disarm his followers and to tell them to resume their ordinary occupation, but if there is any trouble it will be short and decisive, as there are enough American troops now at Manila to make short work of whip ping Aguinaldo’s forces into obedi ence, should it become necessary.
