Now that Mr. Higgins has consented to re sign for his own good, perhaps some induce ments can be offered -which, will make it an abject for Mr. Garland to step down and out. Indianapolis need borrow no anxiety on account of the giving out of anthracite in the Lehigh mines. The supply is sufficient for .this year, and next year natural gas will fill the want. Mr. Pyne, M. P., is too swift for the lum bering English government. He frisks out of his beleagured castle and drives off in his fart before the government can turn around and get its eye-glasses on. The question is whether the President can hold his party up to the rack. There is an evident disposition to give him the shake, and to strike out on other lines than those Mr. Cleveland has mapped out. There is a strong fight going on in the Democratic party, but the President holds the purse-strings, and that gives him an ad vantage that may decide the contest. "We believe Mr. Cleveland will compel his party to come up to the line he has marked out. Eastern mugwumps dislike Senator Chand ler because he is an active, enthusiastic Republican. Now that he is endeavoring to protect Southern Republicans in the exercise of their political rights, they will be more than ever convinced that he is a bold, bad man. A Pittsburg physician favors the estab lishment of a natural-gas crematory in that eity, not for the disposal of human remains, but for the burning of garbage and refuse, accumulations of which are so frequently the cause -of epidemics. The idea is one which may be utilized in Indianapolis "when we get gas. Dr. Burchard, of three "R" fame, having lately called attention to himself by a visit to the White House, the New York Post once more takes occasion to sneer at the idea that his speech had any effect on the result in New York. There is really no reason why the Post should harp on this matter, unless it is jeal ous of Burchard. It may be laid down as a rule that surer methods exist for the accumulation of wealth than suing a newspaper for damages. Mis guided citizens who have attempted to fill depleted pocket-books out of the Journal's treasury by this means will sadly testify to its inefScaoy as they pay the costs of court and lawyers' fees. Loos out for a prolonged howl from the Holid South over Senator Chandler's bill to Regulate the holding of Congressional elections In South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana. White Democrats of these States iave so long been accustomed to doing all the Voting that any attempt to give other men a chance at the polls is regarded as an attack on their personal liberty. Among the great number of things which the late lamented Legislature ought to have done, but did not do, was to provide for the appointment of a State boiler inspector. Had this matter been- attended to accidents Tike that at Seymour might have been averted, and the Seymour case is only one of a long ist of similar calamities which have occurred In the State within the year. The Democrats of Detroit gave a "non partisan" farewell banquet to Don M. Dick inson on the eve of his departure for Wash ington. The speeches were very laudatory of ihe new Postmaster-general, and there were 'Irequent references to him as the coming vice-presidential candidate. The allegiance of postmasters and postal employes will im- toediately be transferred from Vilas to Dick inson! The Missouri delegation is now solid for the President's free-trade ideas. Some of the members kicked pretty vigorously, but the party lash whipped them in. With the ex ception of the Randallites, who favor pro lection from principle, and, therefore, are not Pemocrats on that question, we believe the jgreat majority of the party will be disciplined Jnto line, and committed to the extreme loetrines of the President "s message. It is worth while to remember that it is Democratic postmasters who are striking for iigher pay. Under former administrations the smaller offices were sought and valued not nly on account of the direct compensation received from the government, but for the in creased patronage they insured to the posses sor in other lines of business in which he might be engaged. Third and fourth-class Democrats were hardly installed in office Intil they began to clamor for more pay. What good will it do the Democrats to back and fill on the President's policy? They will have to make the next campaign with Mr. Cleveland as their candidate, and what ever platform they may make, or whatever Bongressional action they may or may not take, the candidate will be the platform, and the candidate has declared in favor of a tariff for the deficiency only. Mr. Cleveland does not even favor a tariff for revenue, but a tariff only for the deficiency that may exist after one-half or more of the revenue neces sary to administer the government has been raised from direct tax upon our own people. In 1 SSI the Democracy denounced the inter nal revenue as an odious war tax, and cen sured the Republican party because it had not repealed it; now the Democracy, by the mouth of their President, declare that the direct tax shall be made permanent, and the tariff shall be reduced below the revenue point, duties upon imports being levied only for the pur pose of raising the deficiency in the necessary revenue to carry on the government. In 1830 the cry of the Democracy was, "tariff for revenue only," American industry to get the incidental protection that might accrue from such a tariff; the cry in 18S8 is to be "tariff for the deficiency only," and American in dustry must be content with the measure of incidental protection that can be smuggled into a tariff on that basis. 

DEMCOEATIG FALSE PEETENSES The squirming of the Democratic leaders over the President's message is very amusing. They all want to compliment it as one of the ablest and most remarkable state papers that ever emanated from human brains, but every mother's son of them is anxious to avoid a clear-cut issue on the line Mr. Cleveland lays down. The sensation the message created was a nine-day's wonder. The ripple it caused has already quieted; nobody and nothing was moved from the even tenor of their or its way; no excitement was produced anywhere; the markets were unaffected; the business of the country declined to get into a ferment to ac commodate the President, or to prove his "scare" statements to be other than the rant of a bumptious amateur. Nothing is more cer tan,as things are now shaping themselves, than that sagacious Democrats will endeavor to blunt the edge of the issue the President attempted to force upon the country, by passing, if they can pass anything, a measure based upon very different ideas than those advocated by Mr. Cleveland. The latest man to procure him self to be interviewed is Mr. Mills, who is to be chairman of the ways and means com mittee of the House. Mr. Mills is a rampant free-trader in theory, but does not want to put his theories in practice just now. He at tempts to ridicule the idea that free trade is the Democratic ultimate; and insists that what the Democrats want is something or anything, but it is not free trade. We are to be treated to a revision of the tariff and a reduction of the surplus in some way, but the peculiar feature of the situation is that all the Democratic papers and statesmen are busy quoting the platforms of the Repub lican party, and the messages of Republican Presidents, and the speeches of such Repub lican leaders as Mr. Sherman, the intent being to show that what they propose to do is exactly what the Republicans would do or have done if they had the power. Now, here's a how-de-do. After all the Democratic blow, the best and the only thing the party can do is to attempt to climb upon the Republican platform, and revise" the tariff and reduce the surplus in accordance with the ideas sug gested by the Republican party. This is a nice backing of their Fat Boy in the White House. Mr. Cleveland has made his first brash effort at being a statesman, and along comes his party within less than a week after he launched his tremendous thunderbolt, and not only repudiate both him and his ponder ous essay, but in every possible way they can they are attempting to assure the country that if anything is done it-will be done after the pattern set by the Republican party. There is no other explanation of the extraor dinary effort on the part of the Democrats to make it appear that the President's message does not mean what every body says it means, and " that what the Democrats propose is nothing more than what the Republicans have been committed to ever since 1868. It is very strange that nobody ever so interpreted a Republican plat form, or a Republican message or a Republic an speech. It is a very remarkable thing that the Democratic party, up to this time, has strenuously opposed the very policy they now assert is what they desire to inaugurate. It is very strange that both in this country and in England the message of Mr. Cleveland was interpreted to mean something very dif ferent from Republican doctrine. It is very strange that in the first blush of enthusiasm such men as Henry Wattcrson "slopped over' upon the fact that Mr. Cleveland had given the doctrine of protection its coup de grace, and that finally "a straight issue" had been made, and that such pseudo-Democrats as Mr. Randall and his followers would either have to become Democrats or go over to the Republican camp at once. What is the meaning of this sudden heat to prove that Mr. Cleveland has recommended nothing more than Republican doctrine for ten years, and that President Arthur and Secretary Folger and John Sher man, in message, and report, and speech, com mitted themselves to the same thing as the Democracy now propose? Is it because the Democrats find they must again masquerade in order to carry their point, or to even ad vance one step in the desired direction? Is it a confession that they cannot so much as undertake the question and expect the public confidence? Is it a confession that they have neither the ability nor the statesmanship to formulate a policy of their own, but must do what they have so often attempted to do, dress up in Republican old clothes, and ask the confidence of the country under a false disguise, as did the cowboys in the revolution, when they lured a vessel upon the rocks by displaying a false lifcht. Whatever it is, certain is it that a change has come over the spirit of the Democratic dream, and Democrats have discovered that the issue they fondly imagined themselves to have found under the sagacious leadership of the White House phenomenon is loaded, and must be handled with the greatest care. It will strike the country now, under the altered condition of things, that if all the Democrats propose to do is what the Republicans would do, and have tried to secure the power to do for the past ten years, that the best thing would be to trust the Republican party with the power and opportunity to do the work. The people will not see the propriety of com mitting Republican policy to the hands of the Democratic party. The Republican party is likely to be the safest and best agent to carry out its own doctrines. The present claim of the frightened Democracy is a sham and deceit. It is an effort to assume Repub lican uniform long enough to make a safe retreat from the untenable position they attempted to occupy with so much gusto and blare of trumpets only a week ago. 

ATTEMPTING A CHANGE OF FEONT. The President, by his free-trade message, has undertaken to execute with the Demo cratic party what is considered a very dif ficult movement, viz., a change of front in the face of the enemy. For many years past the position of the party has been "a tariff for revenue only." They have constantly maintained that sufficient revenue for all the necessary expenses of the government could be raised by tariff duties, and while firmly opposing protection, they were willing that American industry should have whatever ben efit might incidentally come from a strictly revenue tariff. As a necessary consequence, they opposed internal revenue taxes. Thus the Democratic platform of 1884, on which Mr. Cleveland was elected, says: "Sufficient revenue to pay all the expenses of the federal government, including pen sions, interest and principal of the public debt, can be got under our present system of taxation, from custom-house taxes on fewer imported articles. . "The system of direct taxation known as the 'internal revenue,' is a war tax. "We denounce the Republican party for having failed to relieve the people from crush ing war taxes." This denounces internal-revenue taxes, demands their abolition, and demands the retention of the tariff for revenue only. It relies on tariff duties as the only means of raising revenue, and on a reduction of tariff duties as a means of increasing the rev enue, so as to do away with the internal taxes. In his letter of acceptance Mr. Cleve land said: "I have carefully considered the platform adopted by the convention, and cor dially approve the same." Now comes Mr. Cleveland and recommends a total abandonment of a tariff for revenue and the substitution of internal taxes for rev enue, with tariff duties for deficiency. He recommends, first, that the government reve nue ba based permanently upon internal taxes, and second, that the tariff, instead of being made to yield "sufficient revenue to pay all the expenses of federal government," as the platform of 18S4 declared, shall only be made to yield enough to make up the deficiency of internal revenue taxes. What would this be? The total government expenditures in 1886 were $237,034,181; total revenue, $33G,439,727, of which $192,905,000 was from tariff duties, and $116,805,935 from internal revenue. The President now proposes, instead of abolishing these "war taxes," to retain them and make up the balance necessary for government expend itures by tariff duties. Thus, instead of a tariff for revenue, he recommends a tariff for deficit. This is a complete change of front. . The effect of the President's recommendation is to make a present of whatever reduction in the tariff there may be to foroign countries, and to do this at the expense of American industries. Formerly he and his party were committed to the policy of raising the entire government revenue, about $300,000,000 & year, by tariff duties, laid exclusively for revenue, and with such incidental protection to American industries as might be necessari ly involved. Now he proposes raise only about $150,000,000 by , tariff duties and to reduce the incidental protection in the same ratio. The attempt is to transfer the Democratic party from .a platform of a tariff for revenue only to one of internal revenue taxes and a tariff for deficiency, with only such protection to American industry as might necessarily inhere in that kind of a tariff. The managers of a concert in Chicago in aid of the . families of the Anarchists who were hung for murder issued a festival pro gramme containing several pages of advertise ments. These advertisements, of course, were paid for and printed with the expecta tion of attracting customers. In other words, the managers solicited advertisements for a publication to be circulated exclusively among Anarchist sympathizers, thereby implying that they had money to spend. The Inter Ocean, commenting on the absurdity of this, says: 'Five watch-makers and jewelers solicit the trade of these 'oppressed, poverty-stricken' toilers. Four dealers in toys and Christmas presents are anxious for their custom. One photographer and one vender of 'artistic painting' seek the trade of these 'starving poor.' Six 'merchant tailors' wish to gain the patronage of these 'capital-ridden wage earners,' for whom ready-made clothing is not stylish or costly enough." The conclusion is obvious that the mana gers who took these advertisements either did so under false pretenses, knowing that the "down-trodden workingmen" had no money to spend, or else they know their representa tions as to the condition of the workingmen are false. The Washington Post, which is an admin istration organ of a semi-official character, is engaged in making war upon Mr. Randall. The Atlanta Constitution, which favors Mr. Randall, calls the attention of the Post and other free-trade organs to the advisability of fighting Republicans rather than members of its own party. The Constitution realizes the danger of party disintegration from factional fights, and that the only safety lies in the ap pearance, if not the existence, of harmony. It looks, however, to non-partisan observers as though the breach between the factions was already too wide to be healed. E. L. Harper has been followed into the Ohio penitentiary by newspaper reporters who are giving minute descriptions of the pris oners movements, how he ate his first break fast, donned his prison suit, etc This is on the line of glorifying the Chicago Anarchists that so disgusted decent people.' Harper has been convicted of a flagrant crime and is now no more deserving of public notice or sympa thy than any other convict. The reporters should be summarily expelled from the prison and Mr. Harper from the papers. Some of Senator Cockrell's constituents have been complaining of the slow and care Jess methods of transacting business in vogue in the Washington departments, and the Sen ator tells them that this would not be the case if Republican clerks were oustod. He assures them, however, that it is not his fault that so many Republicans are retained in the service, and says he has frequently urged upon the heads of departments the propriety of their removal. . Evidently Mr. Cockrell is a civil-service reformer of the true Democratic brand. He has, however, not yet learned the Administration trick of pretending to favor a non-partisan service while engaged in the pro cess of weeding the Republicans out. Representative Mills, of Texas, boasts that he represents more sheep than any man in Congress, yet is a strong free-trader. It is suggested that if he represented fewer sheep and more Bheep-owners he would take a more intelligent view of the situation. The queerest strike on record is that of the Boston female compositors who refused to set the type for an anti-popery book written by Rev. Justin D. Fulton after they had read a part of the manuscript and found it immoral and indecent. As a general thing, the views of compositors upon the character of the matter they set up are not regarded as of special im portance; but in this case the publishers, after examination, decided that the women were right, and declined to go on with the work. Women are not allowed to "purify politics," but there seems to be nothing in the way of their making literature more respectable. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat says of the reading of Mr. Charles Dickens in that city: "He gave a large body of intelligent people lively satisfaction; he displays none of those elocutionary monstrosities with which profes sional readers sometimes spoil your enjoyment of a favorite author. He is a simple, natural, human reader, whose relationship to the great author intensifies the pleasure with which that author's creations are made vivid in the imag ination." Wherefore, as the Journal said when he read in Indianapolis, let us welcome Mr. Dickens for the contrast he affords with the ordinary pro fessional "reader." The Journal has substantial assurances to the effect that its very full and complete reports of the "mills" between Dempsey and Reapan, Warren and the "Belfast Spider," and sundry other champions, have afforded satisfaction to a large number of readers. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say to these readers that when that distinguished slugger and American citizen, Mr. Sullivan, "does up" Mr. Mitchell, full particu lars will be received by cable. The Journal en deavors to meet all the demands of an intelligent and wide-awake body of subscribers. What with the trial of Mrs. Robinson for the murder of seven people, the rehashing of the Parson-Downs scandal in his suit for back sal ary, and the absorbing record of slugger Sul livan's triumphal tour abroad, Boston is having a real intellectual season. If young Napoleon Ires ever gets ojt of this scrape he will probably confine himself in fut ure , to such financial operations as are within the grasp of his intellect. Banana-stand finan ciering would seem to be about the measure of his capacity. 

ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS. Miss Marie Van Zandt has entirely re gained her health. It is reported that Stanley has been offered $50,000 for a volume describing his present ex pedition. The new Senator from Virginia, John S. Bar bour, adds another rich man to the Senate. He has been a railroad president for over twenty years. Mr. Labouchere graciously remarks that the royal family of England treat the ex-Empress Eugene kindly only because they hope to be re membered largely in her will. The Countess of March, wife of the eldest son of the Duke of Richmond, died the other day from typhoid fever, caught through sleep ing in a bedroom adjoining a bath-room. Miss Grace 3Iatthews, daughter of Justice Stanley Matthews, will spend the winter in Princeton, N. J., keeping house for her brother, who is preparing to enter the ministry of the Presbyterian Church. Epoch: "I think, Mr. Smith," said a friend .of the family, "that your poor wife looked so lovely as she lay there at rest at last." "Yes.V replied the bereaved husband, "Mary always did look well in white." Harper's Bazar: Mamma "Why, Ethel, dear, you mustn't get dolly out to-day. It is Sunday, vou. know. " Ethel "But, mamma, I'm dressing her to go to Sunday-school, you see. and then I'm going to have her read the New York Observer all the rest of the day." Congressman John E. Russell, of 3Iassa chusetts, has made a sensation in Washington by appealing in a bluish-gray overcoat made of wool which grew on his own sheep at his Wor cester farm. It is a remarkable garment, but Russell does not look at all sheepish on account of the attention he attracts when wearing it. The incident is recalled, in connection with the death of Lord Lyons, that when it became his duty in 1863 to inform President Lincoln of the marriage of the Prince of Wales. Mr. Lin coln, instead of a formal response to a cere monious speech, said bluntly, "Well, Lyons, go thou and do likewise." But the diplomate never did marry, and his titles die with him. Washington is a great book -buying centre. In a bookstore in that city one afternoon recent ly the following well-known persons were gathered. at the sT me moment: Mrs. Cleveland. Justices Gray, Matthews and Harlan, several members of the Chinese legation, secretaries Bayard and Whitney, Congressmen French and West and Senators Stockbridge and Edmunds. Wm. D. Howells, the novelist, was in the Whitel mountains for a. time last summer. Henry Rogers, a well-known Boston lawyer, was present at a Tavern Club dinner at the Hub not long ago, when the subject of the modesty shown by authors-was under discussion. "Yes," he exclaimed, "I know something about that. I saw Howells up at the White mountains last summer. He was tli en posing as the Star of Bethlehem." Howells. who was present, did not join in the laugh which followed. Until Mile. Alice Gravy married, says a writer in Truth, (London), the Elysee under her father was a pleasant house. There were, and not seldom, brilliant soirees. The Presi dent was a most gracious host. General Pittie. after the son-in-law came in, tried to react against his prosaic influence; but gradually he became tired, and when he died parsimony and prudence carried all before them. The lights were put out before 10 at night; pleasure was banished for business. The Peruvian, Madame Drevfns. stuck to Alice like her shadow. She crave her a diamond necklace worth $40,000. Of course "donnant aonnanv was implied in tne present. There is extant a letter from DicKens. writ ten soon after the publication of "Nicholas Nickleby." in which he says: "You are right about the popularity of the work, for its sale has left that of Pickwick far behind." How ever this may have been at that time, the state ment is snrelv not borne out by subsequent events, for in the editor's preface to the hand some Victoria edition of "The Picfcwick Papers." just published, it is stated that up to the end of lust vear Messrs Chapman & Hall alone had sold 900,000 copies of the immortal book, to say nothing of many thousands which, since the ex piration of the copyright some years ago, have been issued by various publishers at prices vary ing from a guinea to a penny, or of the sale in the United States, which must have approxi mated, if it has not exceeded, the sale at home. When Modjeska was interviewed the other day in Kansas City on the burning subject of Mrs. James Brown Potter's stage efforts there resulted a vigorous rhetorical outburst. "Let me say," she said, "that Mrs. Potter is a failure, and I am glad of it. She cannot act at all. and why should we, who love art for its sake, take her by the hand I When I was asked to call upon "her I. said: 'No.' For who is she? A wealthy society lady, with a husband who is much handsomer than she, and two lovely childien. Why should artists recognize her! She says she is going to levate the stage; aisd I say, how 1 Is the going to teach us to be vir tuous, to be better wives and mothers by giving up home life I If such be her desire she had better go back to her children. I have no patience that such women, without even talent, (with no excuse of poverty), should be classed with great artists. It is abominable." In Pittsburg the other day Mr. Charles Dick ens, jr., said that he found American hotels very well managed, comfortable, neat, prompt in service and well furnished, but "O dear me, no, they can't cook, one of them ! I don't know what is the matter, whether it is the cooking or the seasoning or the materials, but nothing tastes right. There's something wrong with it all it's bad. that's all that can be said of it." Table etiquette he finds good generally, except for the "beastly practice of bringing on all kinds of viands together, or so nearly so that 'a man sees the next while eating the last.'" He condemns the indecent haste with which meals are brought on and dispatched. He regards a meal-time as a period for leisure, pleasant discourse, tasteful sequences or physi cal enjoyment and dainty attention to details of taste and refinement; a social service in which the dining-room is the temple, the waiters reverent and efficient priests and the partakers respectful and decorous worshipers . Instead of that they are made rude parentheses of ac tion, to be kicked into and out of sight as hastily as possible, as so much waste of time. Lips, however rosy, mast be fed: Songs, however airy, must be hushed; Books, however sinful, must be read; Hair, however auburn, must be brushed. Life 

COMMENT AND OPINION. The Democratic party is just now chiefly en gaged in preparing Republican campaign docu ments for the fight in 1888. Honest confession is good for the bouL Let the good work go on! -Philadelphia Press. One of the things which the American public is waiting to hear is the policy of the Prohi bition party on the tariff question. If thi3 party . expects to elect the next President, that is, if it expects to elect its candidate, the people ought to know what stand the party intends to take. Nebraska State Journal. It is worth noting that only about $4,000 has been raised at Chicago for a monument to the murdered policemen of f the Haymarket; while the Anarchists have raised over $30,000 for a like memorial to the murderers. This may ex hibit the "greed of capitalists," but where are theprints of their "iron heels" on these foreign revolutionists? Springfield Republican. , The whole amount which would be cut off from the revenue by abolishing the duty on wool is about $3,000,000. To effect this small reduction the President would strike down an industry which represents five hundred millions of capital, and a million wool-growers and wool dealers. In this ratio, the havoc that would be occasioned in reducing the tariff to the extent of $S0.000,000 would be something appalling. Bos ton Journal The results of next year's presidential contest will suprise the mugwumps unless we are very much mistaken. The Democratic party has not enough tissue to hold together as one largepiece of political cloth and will be torn into a number of pieces. Mr. Cleveland is making a good many wide gashes in the fabric, and it only needs the strain which comes next year to divide the now almost severed parts. Minnea polis Tribune. We are doing very well indeed under the pro tective system, the only complaint being that we are two rich and are able to shut up a large surplus without being forced to reduce our im portations of luxurious things. We are even able to pay an unnecessary tax of $30,000,000 a year ,pn the tobacco we use. There is a good deal more money in manufactures than in farm ing and the American people are not disposed to help Great Britain out of her prolonged depres sion at the expense of American prosperity. Milwaukee Sentinel. It is rumored, and apparently on good ground, that the attempt to negotiate a new treaty with the British commissioners now in this country has resulted in failure, owing to Canada's stub born insistence on all her claims. In that case, or in case a treaty has been negotiated which is not satisfactory to this country, the President should apply the remedy Congress put in his hands. Canada has snubbed this country long enough. Let us now assert our dignity and in sist on our rights. Other nations will think all the better of us for doing so. Philadelphia In quirer. If the Federation of Labor sets itself fairly in line with American ideas, there is every reason to hope that its career will be great, and prosperous, and beneficial. If it sets itself in opposition to American ideas it may, for a time, seem to prosper, but in due course it must come to the same calamitous end which the Knights of Labor organization is now manifestly ap proaching. The idea of individual liberty is the rock upon which our free institutions are founded. Whosoever falleth upon this rock shall be crushed, and upon whomsoever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder. New York Commercial Advertiser. A great many National bankers are turning their faces toward silver as a security for their circulation. They begin to feel that the stone they, as builders, refused, is liable to become the head of the corner of their structure. They cling, of course, to the interest thought, but they know very well that the plan was origi nated with an idea of cashing the bonds of the fovernment when the war was sore, and that etter terms were given then than can be hoped for with peace restored and the credit of the government the best in the world. The full use of their money, and the guarantee of the gov ernment added, would bo about as good terms as were ever given bankers. Salt Lake Tribune. Some people seem to think that because this government is carried on by popular suffraee free speech agitators of all sorts ought to be let alone until they actually break the law. This is wrong in theory and contradictory to precedent. As we could properly arrest a man whom we overhead plotting to rob a house, so we can justly jail the Anarchist who tells his followers how to plunder a city. But as long as the social revolutionist tries to control the gov ernment by fair and lawful methods he is safe from anything worse than defeat. As anarchy has nothing to do with law its methods cannot be legal, and we promptly convict our Mosts. New York Graphic. THE 

REPUBLICAN OUTLOOK. Chairman Jones la Confident of Sacceaa Blaine and the Nomination. Interview in New Tork Tribune. With the coming convention of Republican clubs and its objects Mr. Jones expressed him self in hearty sympathy, and commended the formation of such clubs as of great value to the party. With reference to the meeting of the national committee at W ashington, and the ar rangements for the national convention next year, he said that he had been gratified by the harmony which characterized the proceedings. "Do you think that Chicago is the best place that could have been chosen for holding the con vention?' apked the reporter. "I favored Philadelphia," he replied, 'but Chicago is more centrally located; and it pos sesses all the accommodations necessary for the gathering. It is easy of access and on the whole I think a good choice has been made." "Is it still looking too far ahead to ask whether Sir. Blaine will be the presidential candidate chosen by the convention!" "Mr. Blaine has not sought and is not seeking the nomination. I do not know whether he would accept the nomination or not. I believe that he can get it if he desires it, and get it al most if not entirely unanimously. I have no doubt that Mr. Blaine is the choice of the great majority of the Republican party. His name is in everybody's mouth, especially since the inter view which the Tribune published. He has al ways been the most popular man in the party, but this interview has, as it were, aroused all the feeling of popular enthusiasm which has been lying dormant since the last campaign." "Naturally, the interview was a good deal talked about by the representatives who were at the Republican national committee meeting?" 'Yes. They were all struck with admiration at Mr. Blaine's response to the President's mes sage. Mr. Blaine took up the views he present ed in his usual spirited way. He seems to have a more comprehensive notion of the situation than any man in this country, and he expressed the views of the party, and. I have no doubt, of the great mass of the American people." - "Do you think that Mr. Blaine's tree expres sion of opinion seemed to indicate that he was speaking as the probable Republican nominee for President!" "Some people so thought, and have called it a bid for the presidency and a clear indication of Mr. Blaine's wishes, and intentions and so forth; but Mr. Blaine's interview was simply a spontaneous reply to the President. He is a man of quick perceptions and made a timely and a telling answer to the message. I think that whether he had been a candidate or not, or whether he ever expected to be a candidate, he would have made that reply. He is just the kind of a man to do that." "Do you care to discuss more particularly any of the points he touched upon?" , "I cordially agree with all 31 r. Blaine said ex cept in relation to the taxation of spirituous liquors. I am in favor of taking oil all the in ternal taxation, as that was a war measure and the necessity of it is over. The income is not needed; and by doing away with it we would get rid of all the offices and officers now neces sary for the purpose of collecting it We would also get rid of the monopoly of manufacturing spirituous liquors which the high tax encour ages. 1 believe in restraining the use of liquor by taxation, but it should be levied and collect ed where it is used and where it causes mis chief." . - "In view of their recent utterances, how do you think Mr. Blaine and Mr. Cleveland will relatively stand with the mugwumps?" "The mugwumps are generally free traders; so Mr. Cleveland's free trade message will ex actly correspond with their views.- I think that the free-trade question will undoubtedly he clearly and squarely the issue at the next pres idential election, and I think, too, that the cit izens of this country will not vote against their own interests. They will not open our markets to unlimited foreign competition." "I suppose you have seen in this morning" Tribune that the President's message has been hailed in Britain with hallelujahs?" - "Yes. If those people on the other side coulc vote Jiere Mr. Cleveland would be elected as of ten as he wanted to on a platform such as he in dicated. Fortunately for us they can't vote but they can talk a great deal." "What, in your opinion, would be the effect oi free trade on this country?" "This country is in a more prosperous condi tion to-day than it ever was before. I do not mean by that that larger profits are being mad by manufacturers and business men; on the contrary, the margin of profit are extreme! y small, but I mean that the volume of trade is larger, and that the people of this coun try, both skilled and unskilled, are more largely employed than ever before, so that there is no necessity at this time for any man being idle. I believe that prosperity to be the result of the momentum of Republican industrial legislation. The effect of Mr. Cleveland's plan would bring ruin upon the country." "What effect would it have on the farming class?" The farming class would be equally affected with the manufacturing perhaps not 50 quickly, but in the end they would all go down alike." "Therefore, Mr. Jones, we want a Republican government. Are we likely to get it?" "There will probably be a Republican Presi dent elected next year, and if James G. Blaini wants it, I think he will be the man." 

TALKS ON THE TARIFF. How the Tariff Operated to the Mind of 1 Man from Denver Who Ha Traveled. New York Press. Mr. S. S. Harper, of Denver, CoL, an exten sive owner and manager of mines, does the tarifi talking for the Press to-day. He is now visit, ing this city. In the course of his business h has been obliged "to visit Europe and has resided for a number of years in London. While in that city he instituted a comparison between the price of several articles 01 every day use in England and this country, which, in view of the statement in President Cleveland's message that the heaviest burden of the protect ive tariff falls upon the consumer, is interesting reading. A reporter called upon Mr. Harper this morn ing and asked him to make the resultof his com parison public through the columns . of the Press. He readily consented, and said: "Upon my first trip abroad I was strongly ad vised by my friends in this country to lay., in a stock of clothing, etc., in London, as those arti cles could be bought very much cheaper there than they could in this country. I did as ad vised, and bought a large amount of under clothing, clothing, neckties, etc Some of the underclothing thus purchased became lost in going from London to Denver, and wishing to replace some pieces. I called upon a dealer in gentlemen's wear in Denver. I desired to ob tain goods as like as possible to those I had bought in London, and, much to my surprise, found that I could duplicate the London under wear for a shade less in price. "The Denver goods so closely resembled th English articles that the clerk could only tell them apart by the firm's private marks. -This rather shook my faith in the statements so freely made by free traders and tariff-for-revenue men, that the consumer was taxed the amount of the tariff. "I then began a series of investigations, and found that most of the articles I had purchased in London, although not such as laboring men and farmers would buy, cost about the same as they do in this country. "For instance, I found that ready-made boots such as I had paid ten and twelve shillings ($2.50 and $3) for in London could be bought in Denver for $2.50 and $3, just about the same thing, as you will see- "I also discovered that I could buy a better ready-made white shirt in Denver for $1 than I could in IiOndon for $1.50, and as the proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof, I purchased one of the $1 Denver shirts and wore it alter nately with the London $1.50 article, with the result that the American garment outwore the English shirt 50 per cent. . "In regard to clothing it is very hard to make comparison. Most of the clothing worn by workmen and the like in Denver is ready-made, and I myself invariably purchase "such clothing. In London, however, no one but the very poor est classes wear ready-made clothing, which is very rough and clumsily made, whereas ready made clothing in Denver is very presentable. The custom-made clothes in Denver cost in some cases nearly double what they do in London, but the cause of this is readily apparent upon a little investigation. A tailor in Denver receives fully twice as much for making a coat as a Lon don tailor does, while the general make-up and appearance of the Denver garment is far superior to that of the London article. On my next trip to London I turned my at tention to agricultural implements and com pared their prices in England with those in this country. "Now I have had no practical experience as a farmer and have had nothing but my observa tion to guide me. "I discovered that the cheapest stubble plow of from three to seven inches, for two horses, costs in England from 4 to 5 ($20 to $25), while in this country tho price of the same ar ticle is 25 per cent. less. ' A. self-binding har vester in England costs from 50 to 5o ($250 to $2o) and a threshing machine, exclusive of horse power, brings all the way from 120 to 140 ($600 to $700). whereas I can buy the same and much better implements in this country at one-quarter of these prices. "An ordinarv farm wagon in England costs from 25 to 2? ($125 to $135), and it is at that such a clumsy and heavy arrangement that no American farmer would have it on his place, I can buy in Denver for from $75 to $90 a wagon which in my judgement is far more satisfactory in every respect. "Take the matter of shovels. In Denver I can purchase a far better shovel foe from 75 cents to $1 than I can in England for the same money, while I found that small quantities of nails cost as much in London as far better ones in every respect do in Denver. "I found it much the same in many more ar ticles, and am firmly convinced that in spite of our tariff the necessaries of life are as cheap in this country as they are in England." , . The Retirement of the Hon. Mr. Biggins. Baltimore Special. The impression in well-informed eircles her is that the retirement of Engene Hirgias is not as voluntary as be would make believe. It was pretty generally understood that if he remained in office until next year he would be made an issue in the campaign, and to avoid this Senator Gorman has consented to his withdrawal from his present position. Hiecins was a visiting statesman to Indiana in 1880 and bis name is not in good repute there, and as Indiana will be a close State it was thought that he ought to be ont of the way. Higgins is doubtless satisfied, because he eoes out with flying colors, and be is too useful a roan cot to be properly cared fcr by his party. He is unquestionably the clever est and boldest practical politician in Maryland. He is a free and easy, broke one day and flash the next sort of fellow, and ba has a great many friends among the gamblers and ward-workers. A friend of his remarked this morning that Engene Higgins would sooner have a $1,000 clerkship in a tobacco warehouse and run a ward than get twice as much salary and be compelled by the civil service rules to abstain from politics or to indulge in them under cover. Six years ago Higeins was president of the Xarylaud Senate. Tbe Legislature meet again in January, and it is quite probable that Sena tor Gorman will provide a comfortable berth for him. The Difficulty In the Way. Philadelphia Pres. Indiana has a fine crop of candidates for the Democratic nomination for Vice-president.whoT so far as heard from, are as follows: Governor Gray, Senator Voorhees. Representative . Hol man and Colonel Denby, present American minister to China. One of these gentlemen would doubtless be nominated . but for the troublesome fact that it is already understood that the tail for the Democratic kite next year must be taken from some other State. Good Advice to Namby-Pambys. Philadelphia Pre. Let the Republicans in New York stop trying to sprinkle salt on the tail of the German vote and m the third-party Prohibition vote, and prove that they are dealing sincerely and courageously with the liquor question, and tho result will bo the same in that State. As Christina Approaches. Minneapolis Tribuue, This is the time of year when the young lady reopens correspondence with her male friends throughout the country and trusts that her long bilence will not be misconstrued as an evidence of neglect and explains that it is merely due to an overpress of aousehold duties.
