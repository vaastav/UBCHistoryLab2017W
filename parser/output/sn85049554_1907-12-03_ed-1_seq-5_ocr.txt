I#' Lr li £1 ft W-i. Os &• "A. r„ I ^3 Washington, Dec. 3.—The. message of President Roosevelt to the Sixtieth congress was read this afternoon. The president points out needed changes v».Jn the Interstate commerce laws, pic |KV-tures the lessons to bo drawn from %'i the recent financial flurry, and dls s.Cusses other live questions, with rec |^f-ommendatlons as to legislative action The message in part is as follows: No nation hus greater resources than ©ore, and I think It can be truthfully {•aid that, the citizens of no nation pos MM greater energy and industrial abil ity. In no nation are the fundamental .' Easiness conditions sounder than In ©ore at this very moment, and it is jfoollsh when such Is the case for peo ple to board money instead of keeping tt la souind banks, for It is such hoard ing that: Is tbe Immediate occasion of money (stringency. Moreover, as a role, the business of our people is con ducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to "farms and fac tories, to railroads and banks, to all oar legitimate commercial enterprises. In any large body of men, however, there are certa'n to be some who are dishonest, and. If the conditions are such that thea»» men prosper or commit their misdeeds. with impunity their example is '-cry evil thing for tbe community. Where these men are busineui' men of grea* sagacity and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckletis, an* where the conditions are such that they act without supervision oi control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many Innocent people int ., making In vestments or embarking In kinds of business that ate really ,unsound. When tbe misdeeds of these successfully dis honest: men are discovered, suffering eomes not only upon them, but upon tbe Innocent whom they have misled. It is ii painful awakening, whenever it occurti, and naturally when it does oc cur those who suffer are apt to forget that the lbnger it was deterred the more painful it would be. In the effort to puiaish tbe guilty it Is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who hare been misled by the guilty. Yet it Is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that- are ..the ultl mate causes of the suffering and, as a means to this end, where possible to punlfih those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental poli cies, but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinch ing perseverance In tbe war against successful dishonesty. Interstate Commerce. No small part, of the trouble that we have comes frtm carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self reli ance, of independence in Initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its fullest exercise compatible with seeing that liberty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro Tided that the national government should have complete and Bole control of interstate commcrce. There was then practically no Interstate business Ijiare such as was conducted by watei*, lland this the national government at lionce proceeded to regulate in thorough Ijgoi.ng and effective fashion. Conditions llhave now so wholly changed that the Interstate commerce by water Is insig nificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged In Interstate commerce. As a result it can be but partially and imperfectly con trolled or regulated by the action of aiiy one of the several states, such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too drasflfc: or else too lax and In either case ineffective for purposes of Justice, pialy the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority aiready exists under the constitution lit amplest and most far reaching form, but It does mean that there should be aa extension of federal activity.

PRESIDENT DISCUSSES NEEDED LEGISLAT Annual Message to Congress Deals With Live Questions—Amendment to Railroad Laws Recent Crisis-No Tariff Revision Now not advocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face and realizing that centralization in business has already come and cannot be avoid ed-or undone a$d that the public at large can only protect itself from cer tain evil effects of this business cen tralization by providing better methods Ifor tbe exercise of control through the [authority already centralized in the national government by the constitu tion itself. There must be no halt in Ithe healthy constructive course of ac jtlon which this nation has elected to pursue and has steadily pursued dur ing the last six years, as shown both In the legislation of the congress and the administration of the law by the ilepartment at Justice.

To aim at the accomplishment of too much usually means the accom plishment of too little and often the do ing of positive damage. Not Repeal, but Amendment. The antitrust law should not be re pealed, but it should be made both more efficient and more In harmony with actual conditions. It should bo to amended as to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by or to lie an incident of a grant of supervisory power to the government over these big concerns engaged In Interstate business. This should be accompanied by provision for the compulsory publication of ac counts and the subjection of books and ready been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no Injustice to the public, still less ^JVE thOBe MU8T 0F fln the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law were abolished there would remain as an equally objectionable fea ture the difficulty and delay now Inci dent to its enforcement. The govern ment must now submit to irksome and repeated delay before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable de cree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control these corporations by lawsuits means to Im pose upon both the department of justice and the courts an impossible burden. It Is not feasible to carry on more than & limited number of such suits. Such a law to be really effec- course be administered executive body and not merely means 0f lawsuits. The design should be to prevent the abuses inci dent to the creation of unhealthy and Improper combinations instead of wait ing until they are in existence and from the hearty then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings. Law Should Be Explicit. A combination should not be tolerat ed If it abuse the power acquired by combination to the public detriment, No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage in ,vhich foreign or Interstate commerce that Is operations create a monopoly or gen eral control of tbe production, sale or distribution of any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of general use and necessity. Such com binations are against public policy. They violate the common law. The doors cf the courts are closed to those who are parties to them, and I believe the congress can close the channels of interstate commerce against them for its protection. The law should make ts prohibitions and permissions as formed for the purpose of or whose J®J ^-operation between the'na- ,-W.

Moreover, discontent Is often expressed with the use of the process of Injunction by the courts, not only in labor disputes, but whe-e state laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am Informed that it will soon receive the consideration of the supreme court. The process of injunction is an es sential adjunct of the court's doing its work well, and as preventive measures are always better than remedial the wise use of this process is from every standpoint commendable. But where it is recklessly unnecessarily used, the abuse should be censured, above all by tbe very men who are properly anxious to prevent any effort to shear the courts of this necessary power. The court's decision must be final. ThB protest Is only against the conduct of individual Judges In needlessly antici pating such final decision or In the tyrannical use of what is nominally a temporary injunction to accomplish what is in fact a permanent decision. The president urges the passage ot a model employers' liability act for the District of Columbia and the terrltorh* to encoUrage corporations to treat in jured wageworkers better. He em phatically indorses the eight hour day. The president urges the Btates to fight the child and woman labor evil. He says: The national government has as IIB ultimate resort for control of child 'la bor the use of the interstate commerce labor from entering Into Interstate com merce. But before using this it ought certainly to enact model laws on tho subject for the territories under Its own Immediate control. Presidential Campaign Expenses.

Then the stlpu latlon should be made that no party receiving campaign funds from the treasury should accept more than a fixed amount from any individual sub scriber or donor, and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could, without difficulty be provided. The Army. Tb'f president recommends legisla tion to Increase the number of officers in tfc.e army, especially ln the medical corps. The rate of pay of officers should be greatly increased, he de clares. There should be a relatively ever, groaler Increase fn the rate of pay of enlisted men if we are to keep the army lu shape to be effective in time of need. The president recom mends severe Examination of officers for promotion up to the rank of major. Froai that point promotion should be purely by election. lie speaks of the recent physical test of army officers with emphatic approbation and recom mends a bill equalizing the pay of officers and men of the army, navy, marine corps and revenue cutter serv ice. Tha Navy. Concen-ing tbe navy the president says: lu my judgment, we should this year provide for four battleships. But It :B idle to build battleships unless, in addition to providing the men and the mtians for thorough training, we pro vide the auxiliaries for them—unless we provide docks, the coaling stations, tha collioi-j tnd supply ships that they ueed. We are extremely deficient lu coaling Btations and docks on the I'a clQc, and this deficiency should not longer be permitted to exist. Pleuty of torpedo boats and destroyers should bo built. Both on the Atlantic and Pa cific coasts fortifications of the best type should be provided for all our greatest harbors. Until our battle fleet ls much larger than at present It should never be spilt Into detachments so far apart that they could not in event of emergency be speedily united. Our coast line is on the Pacific Just as much as on tbe At lantic. The battle fleet should now end then be moved to the Pacific, just us at other times it should be kept in the Atlantic. When the isthmian canal is built the transit of the battle fleet l!rom one ocean to the other will be comparatively easy. Until It is built I earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shifted between the two oceans every year or two. The battle fleet Is about starting by the strait of Magellan to visit the Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships are going under the command of Rear Admiral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two other battleships will meet him in San Fran cisco, whither certain torpedo destroy ers are also going. No fleet of such size has ever made such a voyage, and it will be of very great educational use to all engaged ln It. The only way by which to teach officers and raen how to handle the fleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of war ls to have them practice under similar conditions in time of peace. The president recommends the In creased pny for both officers and enlist ed men and advises promotion by se lection above the grade of lieutenant commander. Foreign Affalis. In foreign affairs, the president says, this country's steady policy ls to be have toward other nations as strong and self respecting man should behave toward the other men with whom he ls brought Into contact. In other words, our aim Is disinterestedly to help other nations where such help can be wisely given without the appearance of med dling with what does not concern us, to be careful to act as a good neighbor and at the same time In good natured fashion to make it evident that we do not Intend to be imposed up^n. The president refers at length to The Hague peace conference. He believes it accomplished much good work. Postal Saving* Banks. The president says on postal affairs: I commend to the favorable consid eration of the congress a postal sav ings bank system as recommended by the postmaster general. Timid deposi tors have withdrawn their savings for the time hslng from national banks, trust companies and savings banks. In dividuals have hoarded their cash and the wcrklngmen their earnings, all of which money has been withheld and kept ia hiding or in the sate de posit box to the detriment of prosper ity. Through the agency of the postal savinsre banks such money would !v
