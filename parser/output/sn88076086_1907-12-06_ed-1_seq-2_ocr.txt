i HlaneapoliB Journtl Justice Stafford delivered his charge to the jury. He asked the jury first to look at the case outside of the ques tion erf sanity. Then the case was given over to the jury for their decis ion. District Attorney Baker urged the jury to cast aside all sympathies and to render its verdict so as to show that immorality is not at a premium in the District of Columbia. Judge Powers of Salt Lake, senior counsel, and Attorney Hoover, for the defense, occupied the morning session, District Attorney Baker following dur ing the afternoon. The defense laid special stress upon the evidence regarding insanity, and contended that it was formar Senator Brown and not Mrs. Bradley who im portuned for the illicit relations that it was not a case of breaking up a home, but that with Mrs. Bradley it was an Attempt to secure a name for her chil dren. Several clashes occurred during the session between counsel. Hoover Talks to Jury. The trial was resumed promptly at ten o'clock Monday morning, Attorney Hoover, for the defense, beginning his argument to the jury. Attorney Hoover argued that it was Brown who importuned for the illegal relation between Brown and Mrs. Bradley that her story of the tragedy was corroborated by the evidence, and that there was ample evidence that she was insane at the time of the shooting. Attorney Hoover finished his argu ment at 11 o'clock and Judge Powers, leading counsel for the defense, im mediately began his presentation of the case. Judge Powers' Argument. Judge Powers argued that Brown dominated Mrs. Bradley that when she sought to leave him he pleaded and begged her to remain and be true to him. When in a burst of eloquence he urged that those "without sin among you cast the first stone," Dis trict Attorney Baker objected on the ground that it was an Improper argu ment. The court would not sustain the objection. The court, at 12:35 o'clock, took a i recess for half an hour, Judge Powers haying finished hi* closing argument for the defense. Court reconvened at 1:13 o'clock and District Attorney ^Baker took lip his argument. Threatened by Black Hand. New York, Dec. 3—William R.

Relief Can Be Granted Only In Individ ual Cases, However—Decision Is Called Unsatisfactory. Washington, Dec. 3.—The supreme court of the United States Monday de cided the case of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad company vs. Mar cus K. Bitterman and others, involving the right of the defendants to engage in scalping the tickets of the railroad company, in favor of the company, the decision being handed down by Jus tice White. The suit was originally instituted by the railroad company in the United States circuit court for the Eastern district of Louisiana, which was asked to enjoin Bitterman and other scalpers from dealing in nonnegotiable reduced fare Louisville & Nashville tickets. That court held the practice to be wrong but decided that relief could only be granted in individual cases, thus requiring a separate action for every offense committed. Both parties to the controversy found the decision unsatisfactory, and both appealed to the circuit court of appeals for the Fifth circuit. The deci sion of that tribunal was favorable to the railroad company, the court hold ing that the wrongdoing was of a con tinuing nature and granting a perma nent injunction. The scalpers brought the case to the federal supreme court with the result that they failed to secure relief there and succeeded only in getting the sweeping action of the court of appeals confirmed. Washington, Dec. 3.—The supreme court of the United States Monday de cided the cases of the Webster Coal company and the Penn Coal and Coke company versus the Pennsylvania Rail road company involving the right to examine the railroad company's books in favor of the coal companies.

CAU3E8 OF THE PRESENT FINAN CIAL CONDITIONS IS MADE THE CHIEF TOPIC. SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND RAILROADS TO PREVENT OVERCAPITALIZATICN. Believes This Would Solve tne Proh lem Together with Provision for More Elastic Currency—Recom mends Postal Banks and Asks for Washington, Dec. 3. President Roosevelt's annual message to congress is a voluminous document of nearly 30,000 words, by far the longest mes sage he has ever submitted to congress. The opening subject of the message is the financial condition of the country, and for which the president lays much of the blame upon unscrupulous stock speculators, and says: "In any large body of men, however, i there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions are ouch that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these man are busi ness men of great sagacity and of tem- i perament both unscrupulous and reck less, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound, When the misdeeds of these successful ly dishonest men are discovered, suf fering comes not only upon them, but I upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the dis tress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it Is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suf fering, and. as a means to this end, where possible to punish those re sponsible for them. There may be hon est differences of opinion as to many governmental policies but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty." He quotes at length from his mes sage of last year in which he advo cated federal control of corporations doing interstate business, and believes that in such control would be found the remedy for overcapitalization and stock speculation which he believes have brought about the present finan cial conditions. He says: "Our steady aim should be by legis lation. cautiously and carefully under taken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action. "This is only in form an innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies and all that I propose is to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also in England before and since this country became a separate nation. Federal Control of Railroad* Is Favored. "No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self-re liance, of independence in initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for it& fullest ex ercise, compatible with seeing that lib erty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. The founders of1the constitution pro vided that the national government should have complete and sofe control of Interstate commerce. There was then practically no interstate business save such as was conducted by water, and this the national government at once proceeded to regulate in thorough going and effective fashion. Condi tions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is in significant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate commerce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax, and in either case Ineffective for purposes of justice. Only the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority already exists under the constitution in amplest and most far-reaching form but it does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. This Is not advocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face, and .realizing that centralization in business has already come and can not be avoid ed or undone, and that the public at. large can only protect itself from cer tain evil effects of this business cen trallzatlon by providing better methods for the exercise of control through the authority already centralized in the national government by the constitu tion itself." There must be no halt in the healthy constructive course of ac tion which this nation has elected to pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur ing the last aix years, as shown both in the legislation of the congress and the administration of the law by the de partment of justice. The most vital need is in connection with the railroads. As to these, iii my Judgment there. .should now bfe Either a national incor poration aet er a law licensing railway companies to engage in interstate com merce upon certain conditions. The law should be so framed as to give to the Interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securi ties, while ample means should be pro vided to enable the commission, when ever in its judgment it is necessary, to make a physical valuation of any rail road. As I stated in my message to the congress a. year ago, railroads should be given power to enter into agree ments, subject to these agreements be ing made pubUc in minute detail «nd to the consent of the interstate commerce commission being first obtained. Until the intionil government assumes proper control of interstate commerce, in tho xerc!se of the Authority ft al ready possesses. It will be impossible either to give lo or to get from the railroads full justice. The railroads and all other great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must come the only question Is as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise it. The courts will de termine the limits within which the federal authority can exercise It, and there will still remain ample work within each state for the railway com mission of that state and the national interstate commerce commission will work In harmony with the several state commissions, each within its own prov ince, to achieve the desired end. Control of Interntnte Bunlneaa Concerns Urged. "Moreover, In my Judgment there should be additional legislation looking to the proper control of the great business con cerns ensured in interstate business, thisf control to be exercised for tneir own benefit and prosperity no less than for the protection of investors and of the general public. As 1 have repeatedly said in messages to congress and else- of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi ness combinations. Modern industrial conditions are such thai combination is not only nm.esaury but inevitable. It is so in the woild oi' bus.ness just as it is so in the world ol lu.oor, and it is as idle to desire to put a.i end lo all corpora tions, to all big- combinations of capital, as to desire to put a i end 10 combina tions of labor. Corporation and labor union alike have rome to stay. Each if properly managed is a source of good and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it should be promptly held to ac count but it should receive hearty en couragement so long as it is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to p«t or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public moral ity, that really puts a premium upon public immorality, by undertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done under modern business condi tions, so that the law itself provides that its own infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success. To aim at the accomplishment of too much usu ally means the accomplishment of too lit tle, and often the doing of positive dam age. "The antitrust law should not be re pealed but it should be made both more efficient and more in harmony with act ual conditions. It should be so amended as to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an incident of, a grant of su pervisory power to the government over these big corporations engaged in inter state business. This should be accom panied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjec tion of books and papers to the inspec tion of the government officials. A be ginning has already been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. "The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injustice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law were abolished, there would remain as an equally objectionable feature the difficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement. The government must now submit to irkBome and repeated delays ^efore obtaining a final decision of the Sourts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control these corporations by lawsuits means to impose upon both the depart ment of justice and the courts an im possible burden it is not feasible to carry on more than a limited number of such suits. Such a law to be really effective must of course be administered by an executive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the crea tion of unhealthy and improper combina tions, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to de stroy them by civil or criminal proceed ings. Investing Public Should Be Amply Safeguarded. "The congress has the power to charter corporations to engage in interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corporations could take out fed eral charters and new federal corpora tions could be created. An essential pro vision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combination within the restrictions of the federal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity in all matters affecting the public and complete protec tion to the investing public and the share holders In the matter of issuing corporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big interstate corporations might be enacted or a combination of the two might be tried. The supervision established might be analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At least, the antitrust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions of the methods whieh ex perience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. The real owners of a corporation should be com pelled to do business in their own name. The right to hold stock in other corpora tions should heareafter be denied to inter state corporations, unless on approval by the proper government officials, and a prerequisite to such approval should be the listing with the government of all owners and stockholders, both by the corporation owning such stock and by the corporations in which such stock is owned. "To confer upon the national govern ment, in connection with the amendment I advocate in the antitrust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefit them as it has benefited the na tional banks. In the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that the institu tions which failed were institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national con trol stood the test. "National control of the kind above ad vocated wopldbe to the benefit of every well-managed railway. Fr.Qm Jhe stand polntof thepubllc thefe ls need! for "ad ditional tracks,•• aditional terminals, and improvements in. the actual handling .of. the railroads,' And £11 this as rapidly as. on auch a matter. Greater Elasticity la Currency la Urged. The president quotes extensively from his last message la dealing with the di -V 1. rect subject of crurrency lfcgtslktlbm and •ays: "I again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this, matter. We need a greater elasticity ih our cur rency provided, of course,, that werecog nize the even greater need of a' safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination! by- the na I tlonat authorities Provision should be I made for an emergency- currency The emergency issue should, off course, be I made with an: effective guaranty and up on conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate' securities approved 1 by the government, and1 must be Issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its re tlrement as the demand fell off. It is worth investigating to determine whether officers and directors of national: banks I should ever be allowed to loan to them- 1 selves. where, experience has definitely shown ^ntee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than of pndp'ivlrinir .."J, y !t oan Trust, companies should' be sub­ ject to the same supervision as banks legislation to this effect should be en acted for the- District of Columbia and the territories. "Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guar- guarantee an Individual against the results of his extravagance. When an in- 1 dividual mortgages his house to buy aji automobile he invites disaster and when wealthy men, or men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become such, indulge in reckless spec ulation—especially if it is accompanied by dishonesty—they jeopardize not only th*ir own future but the future of all their in nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose the whole business community to panic and distress." He advises against any general tariff legislation this session of congress, and says: "In a country of such phenomenal growth as ours it is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or improper bene fits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue hs provided, and that our foreign trade is encouraged There must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only al low for the collection of an ample rev enue but which will at least make good the difference In cost of production here and abroad that is, the difference in 1 the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever be a cardinal point of American policy, The question should be approached pure ly from a business standpoint both the time and the manner of the change being such as to arouse the minimum of agi tation and disturbance in the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of changes represent the pub lic good. This means that the subject cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election, be cause as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it im impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my Judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such elec tion." He asks for the repeal, of the tariff on paper and wood pulp. He reviews and enlarges upon his pre vious recommendations for the enact ment of federal Inheritance and income tax laws. Attention is called" to the prosecution of wealthy offenders against the national laws, and In this connection he asks that the laws under which these prosecutions are brought be strengthened and made more definite. The Use and tke Afeuae of Injunctions. "Instances of abuse In the granting of injunctions in labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that threir rights ar being invaded and their liberty of actic.i and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow. Much of the attack en the use- of the- process of injunction is wholly without warrant but I am con strained to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This ques tion is becoming more and more of prime importance, and unless the courts wili themselves deal with it in effective man ner, it Is certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action. It would be most unfortunate for our social wel fare if we should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that t'^y had just cause for regarding our courts with hostility. I earnestly com mend to the attention of the congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of in junctions and protect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably in vades. Moreover, discontent is often ex pressed with the use of the process of injunction by the courts, not only in la bor disputes, but where state laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am informed that it will soon receive the consideration of the supreme court." Of other legislation in the interest of Tabor he favors federal inspection of rail roads providing limited but definite com pensation for accidents to all workmen employed In any way by the government, and says: "The constitutionality of the employers' liability act passed by the preceding con gress has been carried before the courts. In two jurisdictions the law has been de clared unconstitutional, and In three juris dictions its constitutionality has been af firmed. *The question has been carried to tne supreme court, the case has been heard by that tribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the event that tl|e court should affirm the consti tutionality of the act, I urge further leg islation along the .lines advocated in my message to the preceding congress. The practice of putting the entire burden of loss of life or limb upon the victim or tne victim's family is a form of social in justice in which the United States stands in unenviable prominence. In both our federal and our state legislation we have, with few exceptions/ scarcely gone farther than the repeal of the fellow servant principle of thef old law of liabil ity, and in some of our States even this slight modification, of a complete out grown principle has not yet been se cured." possible.

To fall to stop these prac tices by legislation means to force nonest men Into them, because other wise the dishonest who surely will take advantage of them will have everything their own way. If the statea will correct these evils, well and good but the nation must stand ready to aid them. Inland Waterway Systems Should Be Deevloped. "The conservation of our national re sources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which under lies almost every other problem of our national life. We must maintain for rtur civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization cannot exist. We must show foresight, we must look ahead. As a nation we not Only enjoy a wonderful measure of present prosperity but if this prosper ty is used aright it is an earnest of future success such as no other nation will have. The reward of foresight fot this nation Is great and easily foretold.: But there must be the look ahead,. there must be a realization of the fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land Instead of using it so as to increase Its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our children the very* prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and devel oped. For the last few years, through several agencies, the government has been endeavoring to get our people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our re sources in place of a haphazard striv ing for immediate profit. Our great river systems should be developed as national water highways the Missis sippi. with its tributaries, standing first in importance, and the Columbia sec ond, although there are many others of importance on the Pacific and .Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national gov ernment should undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be made in the present congress and the great est of all our rivers, the MississiDpi, should receive especial attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep wa terway. with deep waterways leading from it to the east and the west. Such a waterway would practically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at once it can be carried through in time appreciably to relieve the con gestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. The work should be systematically and continuously carried forward in accordance with some well conceived plan. The main streams should be Improved to the highest point of efficiency before the Improve ment of the branches is attempted and the work should be kept free from every taint of recklessness or jobbery." Attention is called to the work of Ir rigation and reclamation of govern ment lands. In the same connection he asks for a revision of the public land laws along the lines proposed by the public lands commission. Believes the government should increase its efforts to conserve our forests and should in crease by purchase the existing forest preserves. On the subject of the natural resources of the nation he says: "In the eastern United States the mineral fuels have already passed into the hands of large private owners, and those of the west are rapidly following. It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not »vasted, and it would be well to protect the people against unjust and extortionate prices, so far as that can still be done. What has been accomplished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the action of the administration offers a striking example, of the good results of such a policy. In my judgment the government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas fields in its own possession and to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulations or else, if the con gress will not adopt this method, the coal deposits should be sold under lim itations, to conserve them as public utilities, the right to mine coal being separated from the title to the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked in sufficient quan tity by the several corporations. The present limitations have been absurd, excessive, and serve no useful purpose, and often render it necessary that there should be either fraud or else abandonment of the work of getting out the coal." Progre*M of the Work On tbe Panama Canal. "Work on the Panama canal is pro ceeding in a highly satisfactory man ner. In March the total excavation In the Culebra Cut, where effort was chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic yards. In April this was increased to 879.527 cubic yards. There was a con siderable decrease In the output for May and June owing partly to the ad vent of the rainy season and partly to temporary trouble with the steam shovel men over the question of wages. This trouble was settled satisfactorily to all parties and in July the total ex cavation advanced materially and in August the grand total from all points in the canal prism by steam shovels and dredges exceeded all previous. United States records, reaching 1,274,-. 404 cubic yards. In September this rec-. ord was eclipsed and a total of 1,517 -. 412 cubic yards was removed. Of thiB amount 1.4ST.307 cubic yards were from the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards: were from accessory works. These re sults were achieved In the sainy sea son with a rainfall In August of' l'lr..8S inches and in September of 11.65 inches. Finally, in October, the record waa again eclipsed, the total excavation be ing 1,868,729 cubic yards a truly ex traordinary record, especially la view of. the heavy rainfall, which waa 17.1 inches. In fact, experience during the last, two rainy seasons demonstratea that the rains are a less serious ob stacle to progress' than ha* hitherto been supposed.
