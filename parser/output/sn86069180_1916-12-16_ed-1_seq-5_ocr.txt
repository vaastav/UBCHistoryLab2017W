BIGOTRY Blindly and Ruthlessly Tears Down Both Standing and Reputation. Catholic Lady Injured by Tom Watson's Unwarrantable Persecution. Fnlse Story That Affects Geor gia School Teacher's Career. 

MACON PAPER TELLS THE FACfS Bigotry takes no consideration at all of the results of its ideas and their propaganda. It blindly and ruthlessly proceeds to tear down the standing and reputation of oth ers, in order to satisfy its particular pet halluncinatlon, without any re gard for the possible consequences tor the person or persons attacked. It becomes a very pronounced form of mania, which loses all sense of proportion or of truth. Thomas Watson, of Georgia, is a very striking illustration of that fact. Watson is a bigot of bigots, as is now widely known.. He euffors un der a number of delusions in re gard to the Catholic church arid employs much of 'his time and prac tically the whole of tho columns of his magazine, tho Jeffcrsonian, in a tirade against Rome and its countless iniquities. Tho Macon Dally Telegraph of December 3 contains a long account of what Watson's rash attacks meant in a particular case, that of a Catholic lady-a Miss Rose. Lovett teaching In the Atlanta schools. In the Jeffcrsonian of August 24 Watson in his accus tomed fashion charged that Miss Lovett took the Bibles from non Catholic children and burned them in the stove at the School where she taught. This Mill Lovett denies absolutely. "In regard to the edi torial in the Jeffersonian of August 24," she writes in a letter pub lished in tho Telegraph, "relatlvo to my management of the Onne- wood school, will cay that eadh charge is totally false. I wish to say that I never took away any Testaments from the children in the schools at any time; that I never put them In the stove; none were burned; that I have never burned a Testament or Bible In my life. I wish to say that I never confiscated any property of any Protestant children at any time, nor ever deslioyed any. I wish to say that never, while principal of any school, had I anything whatever to say in regard to the future life of children dying in infancy." But this story, in regard to which Miss Lovett was ofilcially ex onerated, published in the Jeffer sonian, caused such a furore as to compel her resignation in tho school whore she was teaching. She had been there for over eight years, having built up tho school from the beginning. "In June," she says, "the condition grew so Intolerable, and the agitation through the Jef fersonian had so fanned the people that I couldn't stand it any longer and asked to be removed. I was sent to another section of tho coun try to another school a Presby terian section and they refused to havo me. ... I was then trans ferred to another section of tho country, to take still another school. The community was made up of Methodists and Baptists." Here n Methodist minister aroused tho com munity and they refused to accept her. And thus things went on until she was obliged to accept a position as a supernumerary, working only here and there, to fill in where there is a vacancy or need for extra work. The fact that aho and her sister aro obliged to teach in order to help a widowed mother and an other sister docs not make the situa tion brighter forher. And all of ttiis came througti Watson's insano delusions, which unhappily ate shared by many in tho Stato of Georgia, and to aid the candidacy of his camp followers tn tho lato olections! This shows very distinctly the blind injustlco which bigotry pro duces. It should serve to warn those who are Inclined to allow this dangerous form of mania to disturb them to hasten, in considera tion for their fellows, to shake it off. Such propaganda will not aid in raising the life and happiness of the people. It will only toad to frsh hatred and fresh Injustice. It is to be hoped that the American people, whose heart after U la In J the right place, will not permit this canker to spread among them, but will see Its evil effects and will pluck it out. Even some day, it ,1s to bo fondly trusted, Watson's de lusions will be comprehended by his still more deluded followers. Stono throwing after all in any case never pays in tho long run. C. B. of C.

IRELAND. Redmond Says tho Irish Party Is Excluded From Direction of Affairs. Suspicion Aroused "When Caron "Was Taken Into Coalition Ministry. Sinn Fein Has Not Even the night to HoldvPiihlic Meetings. DOWNFALL OF PRIMER ASQUiRH The Irish Press and News Service this week received the following fiom London bearing on tho politi cal situation. Speaking on the col lapse of tho British Government and the downfall of Premier As quit, John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary party, etild: "The Irish party is excluded from any responsibility in the direction of the affairs of the omplro as long aR self-government is denied to Ireland. The present unfortunate position is mainly due to confiding the conduct of the war to a coali tion Ministry, Tho coalition Minis try was formed behind the back of the Liberal party and tho House of Commons, while tho Irish party was not consulted nor allowed to offer an opinion concerning It. They condemned the coalition from the outset, because they were convinced there would be disastrous results for Ireland and that it would be a weak and ineffective instrument In conducting the war. The Inclusion of Sir Edward 'Carson in the Min istry aroused the suspicions of the Irish, causing the impression that home rulo would be killed and that Ireland was again to bo cheated or Its hopes. This, with the stupidity of tho War Office, and the partial restoration of the power of the old Ascendency party in Ireland, checked recruiting, increased tho ranks of the Sinn Felners and led to the rebellion. Moreover the dis appearance of a responsible oppo sition reduced the House of Com mons to Impotence and a position of contempt. Even one can now judge tho result. The same causes which checked recruiting and pro duced all the evils in the Dominions and the United States which have arisen from the trouble in Ireland have now apparently lost the Balkans and caused the present de plorable situation In Greece." In the North Sir John Lonsdale, M. P. for Armagh, is explaining the Unionist policy to the English and Scotch-Irish followersof Sir Edward Carson. He says that the Orange BectlonB of Ulster have contributed more men and money in the war than all the rest of Ireland. "Tho executed rebels had paid the Just penalty for their crimes. Sinn Fein must be crushed and Its fol lowers exterminated. No mercy Bhould be shown traitors to the crown. An independent Ireland Is an impossible dream. After the waf it is certain that the sacrifices of Ulster will unite all England In stern opposition to home rule." One of the leading Sinn Fein men of Cork, a keen observer, had this comment to offor in confi dence: "The time has not come for binn Fein to organize a political party. We nave not even the right to hold public meetings. We can not hold funds though we could secure them. Our brightest men are killed or in prison. English capital controls all Irish industries and all suspeoted Sinn Fein men are deprived of employment. At present we can only conduct a cam paign of passive resistance. Here In Cork our arms have been sur rendered. Wo took no aides In the West Cork election beyond voting ror Healy or Shlpleigh as n protest. The British Government Is breaking down. Ireland's pressing, immedi ate problem Is food." Since above letter was written the Premier of England has been forced to resign and the King of England has announced the appoint ment of Davil Lloyd George to suc ceed Mr. Asqulth. Tho rehabilita tion of Sir Edward Carson is pre dicted as a lesult of the collapse of tho Premier, which spells more trouble for distracted Ireland.
