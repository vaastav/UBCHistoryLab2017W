It -will prove a waste of time upon the part of our Dem ocratic brethren to introduce resolutions recognizing: the independence of the Philippines, at least for yet awhile. On -the 26th of April, 1898, McKinley cabled Dewey "Capture or destroy the Spanish fleet." Dewey promptly responded, "I will wipe jit from the ocean.'- Inside of -three days he did just that -thing:. The die was cast, then and there, in favor of American expansion. Buncombe resolutions of fered in the halls of congress cannot stand against Dewey's victory, nor against the electric cables and chains of com merce which will henceforth bind this government to those far-away Pacific possessions. How like a romance will read the (history of the United States in the Philippines. How Vast and sudden the transformation. It looks as if all the Pacific had fallen into the hands of Uncle Sam. Commerce is the road to civilization. Hawaii and the Philippines are capable of supplying a large portion of the tropical fruits and sugar consumed in the United States. The annual im portations of tropical products into this country amount on the average to about $250,000,000. The Philippines abound in all manner of undeveloped wealth in tropical fruits, gums, dyewoods, tobacco, coffee, spices, cabinet woods, ihemp, and possibly In valuable minerals. "What the natives formerly purchased was from Spain. Soon they will con sume far more, and we are logically the people from, whom they will purchase. The Philippines Imported from Spain in 1SS6 agricultural and manufactured goods to the amount of 58,000,000. What may they not purchase after they ha e learned to have full confidence in us? The Beer Drinkers Feel Better. Germany didn't like McKinley's war on Spain, but Ger many is tickled to death over McKinley's message to con gress. And so the realm of Kaiser "Wllhelm is warming up towards America and we are to hear' less of rotten American potatoes and trichanaed meat from the kraut caters. A dispatch from Berlin says: "It is probably not too much to say that President McKinley's message will have a lasting effect in cementing American-German friendship. A pronouncedly cordial and amiable tone toward the United States has become general in the Ger man press." Independence and American Manhtfod. Socialism and Americanism are diametrically and in every other way opposed. They cannot exist together. If Socialism ever becomes a dominant Influence in this coun try Americanism goes down. The Idea begotten of French communism cannot be made to harmonize with the ideas of the fathers who founded this government. This govern, spent of free institutions and personal liberty was built upon the theory that protected in his natural rights every man Is able to take care of himself and Is the freest and happiest in being allowed to do so. That is the theory, and It has held better In practice than any government ordained f men since the world began. The theoretical government of Golden Rule Jones of Toledo-and of Debs and their con freres in practice would prove a depressing level which would kill off individuality and dwarf the race. The propo sition that everything should belong to everybody share and share alike may be attractive to a class who, too weak mentally or physically, or too lazy to accumulate an aver age share of the sum total of human holdings, but it would t)on resolve itself in practice into a government so irre Eponslble that the man who had got away with his share of the divy coukl without compunction kill and rob the next fellow who had held on to his share. If no division, but all and everything in common, the civilization under that regime would be exactly that of the Indian or negro in his trtbal relations. Governments cannot be resolved Into a paternalism and not degrade the dependent Depend ency and manhood are Incompatible because American man Q.uod signifies Independence. Socialism is silly. Socialism is not a conservator, but an ener'3tor. What He Knocks Them Down With. The new gavel of the new speaker of the house, Gen eral Henderson, is ornate enough. The head is of rosewood, from Moniojo's flagship, and the handle of native osage, brown in Polk county, Iowa. It is decorated by an eagle's I ak bearing a scroll Inscribed "E Pluribus Unum." On the uwer ferrule are doves and a garland, on the lower piUures of the United States steamships Iowa and Des blames. The Iowa arms and Mr. Henderson's monogram ur on the side of the head. And yet it may never be so impeUiuj" as was the gavel in the vigorous hands of T.m Reed of Maine. However, Henderson was brought up to knock-down and kick-out work. The first round-up he ter witnessed was when he was a six-year-old Jn his old yiotland home. He saw his father kick a nobleman out of lus home, to which act Henderson owes his American citi-E-nship, His father had to leave the country ruled by Brit U'i royalty. Lttr, as a fighter this boy won stars, and i w he is the biggest toad in the blg-geet political puddle In America. The Alillions and Rivers in the Beer Traffic. The amount of money that Is swallowed up or gulped down annually by the world of beer drinkers is enormous. Hut so is the amount seat up in smoke or spit out by the, u-rs of tobacco. The aggregate of any expenditure by the Aorld Is almost inconceivable, fot that matter. But as to t.ie manufacture and consumption of beer in the old coun ir s, Gfunbrmus. beer organ published in Vienna, says 'hat there are 2Q.J40 breweries In Germany and 1.S0S In A u-uro-Hwisjary. The total number in the world It gives s 76,17$. with an annual production of 6.250 million gallons. Vhe excise duties paid by the European breweries amounted - 5 1SS to J4S2.W0.000. The largest per capita production i1-, of course, in Germany, amounting In Bavaria, which 1 i 's all beer brewing and consuming countries in the -i iid, to seventy-eight gallons for each individual of the population. Otto Von Bismarck Was a Gallant. Current Literature tells this story of a great statesman, r -w dead: On day a young Swede, a student at tfce Uni--vity of Berlin, received a letter from his uncle saying iv.it his daughter, the young man's cousin, would stop a 3 nm for a few day on her way to Kms, and would be k ily meet her and allow her the citv. The mad coach a -lived and with tt the young lady, who round a line look. in; jcung fallow with a vivid bottteanftk r4tlafT her ar rival. He accompanied her to the hotel. The following morning he called and took her driving in an elegant brougham. These attentions continued during the three days of her visit. The lady appeared overjoyed at the gal. lantry of her cousin, whom she had aever met before. On the day of her departure, while assisting' her into the mail coach, the young man said: "I cannot let you depart with out making a confession." The lady blushed and dropped her eyes. "I must tell you that I am not your cousin. Tour cousin Is a friend of mine. He had not time to accompany you, having to cram for his examinations, so he bade me take his place." "In heaven's name, who are you then?" cried the lady. The young man handed her his card. The postilion blew his trumpet, and the mail coach rolled away as the joung lady read his name on the card: "Otto von Bismarck." Playing for Great Stakes. The Orange Free State has proclaimed the annexation of Bordrecht, about fifty miles north of Queenstown, Cape Colony. Nearly every day we hear of the Boers annexing British territory. It is comparatively easy, for it only re quires a pen, and not a sword, at the present stage of South African proceedings. This business of annexation of course presupposes that the Boers feel sure of winning the war. Of course, should the result go the other way, the British will cfctlm that the unquestioned precedent has been set them for annexing the whole Boer establishment. The Boers are playing for great stakes, and have doubtless made up their minds to abide the fortunes of war Will be Very Wealthy. The woes of South Africa are primarily due to Cecil Rhodes, secondarily to (the greed of his countrymen. The promises made by England to the Boers to be trampled under foot, the (treaties which she has violated, came of the efforts which were inspired by Rhodes. Cecil Rhodes will make an enormous fortune out of the Boer war. II. Ryziger, president of the syndicate chamber of dealers In precious gems of Brussels, was asked about the effect of the South African wrar on the value of the De Beer dia mond mines and diamond prices. He replied: "Since Janu ary, 1898, the price of diamonds has risen 70 per cent, due in the first instance to the l-estrlction of its output by the De Beers, and latterly to the war. The prolongation of the shutting up of the Kimberley mines will cause a further in crease probably 30 per cent in price. If water gets Into the workings, it may take a year, or even two, before the mines will be again in full working order. So prices are almost certain to reach extravagant figures." The Rhodes combination, controlling the diamond imarket of the world, has stock on hand of an estimated value of $15,000,000. So its profit from the war must be enormous. -- ill Tie Onto Our Possessions. At least one recommendation In the president's message has evoked action thus early. Congressman Corliss of Michigan has Introduced a bill for the laying of a cable to Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines. The cost is limited to $8,000,000, and a preliminary appropriation of $500,000 Is made to begin the work. The cable Is to be laid under the direction of a commission, and the bill provides that the rates are not to be more than 35 cents a word from San Francisco to Honolulu, and not more than $1 a word to Manila. -& Can Cook, Sew, Clean and Bake. Paul Kruger, in proving more 'than a match for the English invaders himself, is more than matched by his wife. Mrs. Paul Kruger is said to have accepted her husband's offer of marriage wilth the words: "I can bake, I can cook, I can sew, I can clean, I can scrub." Whether or not that is the customary Boer formula Is not explained, but it is true that the wife of the president of 'the Transvaal has lived up to her words. Oom Paul is said to be worth sev eral millions. Much of this accumulation 5s attributed to the thrift and economy of his wife, who was not only able to do the things that could help to make a man rich, but was not ashamed to. She is still a gentle-mannered, blue eyed woman, who has not changed her method of life be cause the husband she married as a poor man has come to have riches and power. She still attends to the duties of which she told her husband she was capable. The house hold -work is her exclusive duty. That begins at 5 o'clock in the morning with the preparation of breakfast. For making the Ort coffee with the smallest amount of the bean she is famous in the Transvaal. Her days are passed between the intervals of heavier labor, in sewing and darning 1 He Was a Bright Filipino. The slain leader of the Aguinaldolators, Gregorio del Pilar, is said to have been graduated at a European uni versity and to have figured in two revolutions. Even President Schurman, of the Philippine commission, consid ered him clever, and he certainly showed himself an able fighter worthy of a better cause. $. "This," said Julius Caesar, standing in the forum, ""is the first day of the Christian era, and consequently I am living in 'the first century." And then forty-five senators grabbed pencils out of their togas and began to prove to him that he was mistaken. s The supreme court has not held that it Is Justifiable homicide to take a club and brain the man who wants to homicide to take a club and brain the man who wants to discuss with you the real end ot the century, but It "will. $ Possibly that 29th day of February every four years has thrown the century out of plumb. Do not forget that when your neighbor comes up to you and tries to prove that the century doesn't begin until January l, 1901. '. Drop all business and plunge into the discussion over when the century really ends. Business doesn't amount to much, any way, and the exact ending of the century is an important matter. Mr. Williams of Mississippi Is in favor of. surrendering to AguinaJdo if he will give us one little lone coaling sta tion. Ouuade his residence in Mississippi, Mr. WHliams is not an American.

"This is. you may say, the first public recognition of my my ability." She flushed at the egotism of her words, and handed her aunt a printed circular which set forth the fact that the Writers' association Intended to meet at Clinton, Iowa, for purposes artistic and sociab.e, and Mary Bell Duncan, otherwise "Bry ant Hawley," was invited as a represen tative Western writer to be present. Miss Mathilda Duncan, being a kindly woman, endeavored to appreciate the gratification of her niece. Writing had always seemed rather a singular and affected thing to her, especially In the line of fiction. She hadn't so much to say ne-ainsfr McfiiT-c that waa Well enousrh. Bhe had not confessed to any of her neighbors that Mary Bell, who enjoyed the reputation of being a sensible girl, had taken up writing, and as she used a masculine name to disguise her identity in writing, there seemed not much dan ger that she would be found out. Her stories, published in a number of well known periodicals, had, as it transpired, attracted sufficient attention to cause the officers of the Writers' association to in quire of the magazines her true name and address that she might be invited to par ticipate in their literary convention. Miss Mathilda, who was a practical stock raiser, remembered the pride she had felt when she was invited for the first time to be present at the National Poland China Breeders' association, and she, therefore, arose to the occasion and con gratulated her niece. She went even fur ther, and bought her two new gowns. "The thing that gives me the most pleasure in the matter," said Mary Bell that evening, "is that I shall almost cer tainly meet Helen Hepburn you know I have spoken to you about her stories a number of times. She writes about the very things that I would choose to write about if I had the power, and in the way that I would like to do it If I could. Some times, when I read what she has written, It seems to me that I must have written it myself It will be a happy day for me when I meet her. I expect to take a satisfaction in her acquaintance that 1 never have In the society of any one else." "I hope you will meet her," replied Miss Mathilda, just a trifle hurt. She knew she had not been just the person to raise an imaginative, sensitive, bookish girl, but she had done the best she could, and it was not pleasant to be reminded in this thoughtless way of her failure to fill that girl's intellectual needs. But she put vanity aside and saw Mary Bell off in all the splendor of her first tailor-made suit. Mary Bell's eyeB were glowing and her face full of health and expectation. "It is nice to be young," observed Miss Mathilda to herself as she went home to prepare the pedigree of a black hog she was to place on exniDition at ine cuumy falr. All the way to Clinton Mary Bell's heart beat merrily. She was an author going to an author's convention. How little the woman who sat In the seat next her guessed ltl How far from suspecting it the young man who looked like a com mercial traveler. He had a handsome leather case with him a dress suit case, though Mary Bell did not know It which contained without doubt, so she said to herself, his samples. His large, round head with Its close-clipped hair, his hearty laugh and frank, direct manner, and his rough tweed suit marked him, somehow ,as a knight of commerce. "Could anything bo more modern or more commercial?" observed the young authoress to herself. "How different the ideas he will offer me from those I shall get from Helen Hepburn when we meet." And with a view to enjoying the contrast, she kept up a vivacious conversation with the young man.' Mary Bell had not had much social experience, but she was pos sessed of a natural sense of politeness, so she endeavored to talk about things that would interest this engaging Philistine. She discoursed about her aunt's stock farm, and about the relation of trade to politics, and defended imperialism and sympathized with those who had to live on railroad trains and at eatlncr-houses "I once read a touching and beautiful story about a commercial traveler and a little boy: I think it was called 'The Nomad,' and It was written by a fellow of the name of Bryant Hawley. I al ways think of that story when I hear any one sympathizing with the commer cial traveler," said the young man. Mary Bell flushed with exquisite pleasure, of course, the story was her own. She en deavored to show her gratitude In a prac tical way hy talking with the young man about his calling. "What line do you carry?" she asked. "I I beg your pardon?" stammered her companion. "What house do you travel for?" "O ah h h a pencil house. But Speaking of pencils, I don't know any writer today whose pencil I would rather hold than that of the same man I was speaking of Bryant Hawley. I am con vinced that If we were to meet we would prove the best of friend." Mary Bell covered up her delighted em barrassment with a hasty remark. "Do jou sometimes feel that way about people, too?" she Inquired. "Now, that Is just the feeling I have about a certain woman unknown to me at present except through her beautiful work. I hope to have the great privilege of meeting her this afternoon and I am ardently dream ing that she will like me as well as I like her." "Ah!" said the young man, much In terested. "Do you like to tell me her name?" "Indeed," cried Mary Bell, "I would rather speak her name than not It is a distinguished one It Is Helen Hepburn " For some reason that Mary Bell could not "urmle this remark appeared to dis comfit the younsc man exceedingly, though he did not look displeased, but conversa tion flagged between them. It seemed almost as if they had suffered some sort of a misunderstanding At Cllnto Mary Bell got her belongings together and hld out her hand to hr companion as the train moved into the station. She desired to part good friends with him he was certainly a delightful young man! What a pity, she thought, that we cannot keep within our knowledge the people we meet and choose. "Ships that pass In the night, and speak each other In passing.

Someone came bustling up evidently a member of the retention committee "Are you MIs Duncan" I thought o. Whcr! Mr. Denslow? We expected him on this tnIn." Mary Bel!' companion raised his hat.
