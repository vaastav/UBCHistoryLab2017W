Customs Revenue Reduced and Free Ll3t En larared Duties so Ad justed as to Have Regard to the Interests of Our Own People. WAsmsGTOx, D. C, December 11. "Under the operations of the new tariff the customs revenue has been decreased as far as is con sistent with the current needs of the govern xnent by the readjustment of duties in the line of protection to American labor and American industries, the free list has been enlarged by the addition of articles which, from climatic or other conditions, are not produced profitably or extensively in this country; adequate protective duties have been imposed upon articles which come in competition with our own productions; new industries have been established and others stimulated, thereby giving increased employ ment to American labor and better control of our home market to our own people; and the price of nearly every article of common consumption has been reduced to the con sumer. Inasmuch as a considerable portion of our revenues must be derived from duties on imports, it is thcrpart of wisdom and patriotism to so adjust the rates as to have regard first, to the interests of our own peo ple and the rightful demands of American labor for remunerative wages. I do not be lieve that any considerable number of the people desire to see onr manufacturing in dustries destroyed or wages reduced to the European basis, which would be the inevita ble result of the reduction of the duties with s view to revenue only. A comparison of the prices of goods Imported respectively under the old and new tariffs, where rates have been increased, will demonstrate that the tariff is a tax upon the foreign competi tor in our markets in the sale of such articles as are extensively produced here, and that the duties are in fact thus productive if de ducted from the foreign market value, and are paid by the foreigner as a tax for the privilege of selling his goods here." MORE OF THE MESSAGE. Election Reforms Discussed. The president's message contains the fol lowing sections: ELECTION BEFOKSIS. Nothing just now is more important than to provido every guaranty for the absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage within the respective states of all the officers of the national government, whether that suffrage is applied directly as in the choice of members of representatives, or indirectly as in the choice of senators and electors of .president. Respect for public officers and obedience to the law will not cease to be the characteristics of our people until our elections cease to declare the will of majori ties fairly ascertained without fraud, sup pression or gerrymander. If I wero called upon to declare wherein oar chief national danger lies 1 should say without hesitation, in the overthrow of ma jority control by the suppression or perver sion of the popular suffrage. That there is a real danger here all must agree. But the en ergies of those who see it have been chiefly expended in trying to fix responsibility upon the opposite party, rather than in efforts to make such practices impossible by cither party. Is it not possible now to adjourn that in terminable and inconclusive debate while we take, by consent, one step in the direction of reform by eliminating the gerrymander which has been donouueed by all parties as an influenco in the election of electors of president ana mombers of congress? All the states have, acting freely and sepa rately, determined that the choice of electors by a general ticket is the wisest and safest method, and it would seem there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment making that method permanent. If a legis lature chosen in one year upon purely local Questions should, pending a presidential con test, meet and rescind the law for a choice upon n general ticket and proide for the choice of electors by the legislature, and this trick should determine tho result, it is not too much to say that tho public peace might be seriously and widely endangered. 

DANGEHS OP TUE QERKTMAXDEB. I hfcvs alluded to'tho "Gerrymander" as affecting tho method of selecting electors of president by congressional districts, but the primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery havo relation to tho selec tion of members of the house of representa tives. The power of congress is ample to deal with this threatening and intolerable abuse. Tho unfailing test of sincerity in election reform will be found in a willing ness to confer as to remedies and to put into force such measures as will most effectually preserve the right of the people '- free and equal representation. An attempt was made last congress to bring to bear tho constitutional powers of the general government for the correction of frauds against the i IT rage. It is impor tant to know whether the opposition to such measures is reaily rested in particular fea tures, supposed to bo objectionable, or in cludes any proposition to give to the election laws of the United States adequacy to the correction of grave and acknowledged evils. I must yet entertain tho hope that it is possible to secure a calm, patriotic consid eration of 6uch constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to secure the choice of the olncers of tho government to the people by fair apportionment and free elections. I believe it would be possible to constitute a commission, non-partisan in its member ship, and composed of patriotic, wise and impartial men, to whom a consideration of the questions of tho evils connected with our election system and methods might be com mitted with a good prospect of securing unanimity m some plan for removing or mitigating those evils. The constitution would permit tho selection of the commission to be vested in the supreme court, if that method would give the best guaranty of im partiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring into the subject of the law of elections as related to the choice of officers of tho national government, with a tjew to securing to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is attainable. THE 

QCKSTIOS OT BtJTTBAQB. 'While the policies of the general govern ment upon the tariff, upon the restoration of our merchant marine, upon the river and harbor improvements and other such matters of grave and general concern are liable to be turned this way or that by the results of congressional elections and ministrative pol icies, sometimes involving issues that tend to peace or war, to be turned this way or that by the results of a presidential election, there is a rightful interest in all the states and in every congressional district that will not be deceived or silencedVby the audacious pre tense that the question of the right of any body of legal voters in any state or in any congressional district to give their suffrages freely upon these general questions is a mat ter only of local concern or control. The demaad that the limitations of suffrage shall :be found in the law. and only there, is a just 'demand, and no just man should resent or .resist it- My appeal is, and must continue to be, for a consultation that shall "proceed with candor, calmness and patience upon the lines of justice and humanity, not by prejudice and cruelty." To the consideration of these very grave question I invite not only the attention of coagress, but that of all patriotic ritaseas.

Washisgtojt. D. C. December 12. Daring the first work under introduction of business in the senate the "Kansas senators offered these: Peffer offered a resolution which was re ferred to the finance committee, directing that committee to inquire and report as soon as practicable as to the actual expenses at tending the business of money lending, as conducted in the United States, by bankers and other persons (both as to short loans and long loans), the object being, as he declared in tne resolution, to ascertain approximately the actual and relative cost of conducting the business of lending money without reference to the value of the amount loaned. Peffer offered bills: To amend the immigration and naturaliz ation laws; to grant service pensions, with additional amounts to prisoners of war; to provide means for their payment and to re peal section 2 of the pension act of June 17, 1889; to reduce the number of pension rat ings to ten; to abolish pension agencies and to lessen the expense of examining boards. Plumb offered a resolution declaring that "congress desired the removal of the re mains of the illustrious soldier and states man, General Grant, to, and therein interred in the Arlington national cemetery, and that the president be requested to convey to the widow of that lamented man, such desire, tendering to her, on the part of the nation, all necessary facilities for such removal and interment." The resolution was laid on the table. Plumb giving notice that he would call it up at at a convenient time. Plumb offered bills: To provide for the free coinage of silver and the promotion of international free coin ago of silver. lo provide for the retirement of national bank notes and the free coinage of silver. This is the same bill introduced in the senate by Plumb last year, with a few amendments increasing from 20 to 30 per cent, the gold and silver reserve fund fer the redemption of United States notes; forbicding free coinage in the United States of foreign coin, and au thorizing the secretary of the treasury, in his discretion, to call for the payment of customs duties in gold or silver, in whole or in part. What They Say. Losdojt, December 12. The St James Gazette says: ''It's most important point is that which refers to tha tariff. The argu ment presented compares significantly with British figures, which show a stationary con dition of trade. It is all well to say that Americans will presently discover the mis take in the fiscal policy, but perhaps they may not. In the meantime the calculations cf the supporters of the McKinley bill are working out much better than any one in England had reason to expect." New York. The Recordor says the mes sage is American throughout. It is a com prehensive statement of an executive well informed as to the relations of our country with others and always just regarding them, but who considers every topic, first of all with absolute devotion to the interests of the people of the United States, and particularly of tho great moss of population who are wage earners. The document cannot fail to in crease the respect of the world for the Amer ican people's institutions and firmness and dignity which they are considered. The Tribune says the one characteristic of the mosago which must impress every can did reader is its absolute freedom from par tisanship or prejudice. There is in it no straining for effect. It is a simple, clear and businesslike statement of public affairs, full of practical suggestions. The Press says the message is a thoroughly American document, in every line of which spirit and patriotic desire for the public wel fare is clearly expressed. A Son of Joaquin Miller. San Fkaxcisco, Cal., December 11. Jo seph McKay, who is in jail at Ukiah, Col., charged with stage robbery, has been found to bo tho son of Joaquin Miller, the "Poet of the Sierras." The real name of the young man is Harry Miller. He is 22 years of nee and the son of the poet by the latter's first wife, Minnie Myrtle. On November 13 the Ukiah and Eureka stage was held up nine teen miles from Ukiah by a masked man, armed with a rifle. Charles Lambert, the stage driver, upon reaching Ukiah, told the sheriff and the latter started on the trail. He found the empty treasure box and learned that a farm house in the vicinity of Willetts' village had been robbed a few days previ ously of a rifle and other articles similar to those in posession of the masked man who stopped the stage. The sheriff followed to Hopcland, fourteen miles south of Ukiah, and there learned that Miller had been cut ting wood for a man named Willard, and had left Willard's four days prior to the stage robbery and returned there a few days after the robbery. After obtaining bis mail Miller again disappeared. Tho sheriff followed the fugitive to Santa Rosa and arrested him at a hotel there. In relating the story, the sheriff said that Miller, after considerable persua sion, confessed and took tho sheriff to the place where the rifle and ax had been buried. Miller says his life might have been differ ent, but he never was encouraged to go to school or make anything of himself. Safety in the Railroad Service. Washisgtox, D. C, December IL The following is taken from tho president's mes sage: I have twice before urgently called the at tention of congress to the necessity of legis lation for the protection of the lives of rail road employes, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June 30, 1890. 369 brakemen were killed and 7,811 maimed while engaged in coupling cars. The total number of railroad employes killed during the year was 3,451 and the number injured 23,390. This is a cruel and largely a needless sacrifice. The government is spending nearly $1,000,000 annually to save the lives of ship wrecked seamen; every 6team vessel is rig idly inspected and required to adopt the most approved safety appliances. All this is good, but bow shall we excuse the lack of in terest and effort in behalf of this army of brave youug men who in our land commerce are being sacnSced every year by the con tinued use of antiquated and dangerous ap pliances. A law requiring of every railroad engaged in interstate commerce the equip ment, each year, of a given per cent of iti freight cars with automatic couplers, and air breaks and couplers to be used, would very soon and very greatly reduce the present fearful death rate among railroad employes. Reckless Franchise Giving-. Washington, D. C, December 11. Presi dent Harrison's message has this paragraph: The indisenminate granting of franchise! of enormous value, without recompense to the state or municipality from which they proceed and without proper protection -of the public interests, is the rrat noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation. This fault should not be committed in dealing with a subject that will befoie many yeast affect so vitally thousands' of our people. Another War Rumor. Sax Fbaxcxsco, December 1L Paul Ber tr, the special agent for America for the Krupp gun works of Germany, has arrived here from Mexico. He received a cablegram from the Krupp company informing aim that it was probable war would soon be de elarei between Chili and the Argentine coa- fedarafcoa, and lastmcliss sua to t Valasrsiso at eaca. 

FAVORABLE Everywhere In-the Country Ex cept for Cotton Producers. Trade Heavy and Collections Good Save In the South Sixty Millions Tied Up In Low Priced Cotton Carpets Cheaper Than In Ens land. Nw Tome December 14. B. G. Dun Co.'s weekly review of trade says: As the hollfdays draw near all signs indi cate a large volume of business at present, with growing confidence of improvement in the future, except in parts of the south, where the unusual accumulations of cotton and its low price have a depressing influence. There is no lack of money in any part of the country, except at some southern points, and the mere fact that the cotton now accum ulated at a few points ana interior towns represents fully $CO,OCO,000 in value, if paid to planters at once, explains the difficulty and suggests that it is not permanent. It is a good sign, also, that collections are, on the whole, improving, though slow at southern points and only fair in soma lines at eastern cities. Reports from ail points of the country show n very fair activity in the distribution of merchandise. At Chicago the usual increase was seen in breadstuffs, but lack of transpor tation throughout the country causes eome embarrassment, and, perhaps, part of the decline in receipts of cattle, batter and cheese. The merchandise sales much exceed last year's and collections are far ahead. At St. Louis the holiday trade opened very strong and generous distribution is seen in heavy clothing, shoes, groceries, drugs and oils. At Omaha the car famine retards business, and at Kansas City it was quieter than ex pected. The expected reduction in tho price of car pets has come, from 10 cents on body Brus sels to 5 cents on ingrains, which are now said to be cheaper here than in England. Print cloths show some improvement, and prints are more active. The boot and shoe business has clearly in creased, and the iron business is more active. The monthly crop report gave little help to speculation. Wheat has been 1 cents higher, oats cents higher, with moderate sales; but corn is 1 cents lower. Pork products are slightly stronger; coffee H cent and oil 1 cents higher, without great activity in any branch of speculative trade. Exports of domestic products continue largo, and for the last week were 44 per cent, more than for the first week of December last year. The business failures throughout the coun try during the past week were 320, compared with 333 the previous week. In the corres ponding week last year the figures were 370. On the Peaceful Coast. L03 Angeles, Cat., December 15. A ter rible gale has occurred here, when the wind reached a velocity of 6eventy-eight miles per hour. Its severity seems to havo been the greatest in Pasadena and in San Gabriel valley. So far as reported two persons were killed. Mrs. Brown, living near Glendale, was Durned to death, and A. D. Tabor wob killed at Nor walk. In Los Angeles the damage was nominal. Pasadena, however, was less fortunate. Reports from that place announce the wreck of several churches and the destruction of many houses and barns. The Raymond hotel has suffered serious loss. The destruction to orange orchards is reported heavy. In ex posed places tho fruit was blown off. All the wires on the line of the Santa Fe are down except a single wire east via Bar stow. Reports made by passengers coming in are that a number of buildings along the line are blown down and much fruit blown from the trees. The storm was terrific up in tho San Fran cisco valley. I ho old mission at San .Ber nardino was shaken up as it never was be fore. Great chunks of the adobe walls were hurled about. Big timbers placed in posi tion centuries ago were dragged from their resting places. At Burbank the Presbyterian church was wrecked. Here and there along the Los An geles river section barns and fences were wrecked. At Los Felize a Chinaman was caught un der a flying roof and badly injured. Another Chinaman was struck on the head by falling limber. Holiness church at Monrovia was wrenched from its foundation. The Metho dist church was damaged. Three coaches on the rapid transit road were blown from the track. It is reported that the old mission church at San Gabriel was badly damaged. The storm in that sec tion of tne valley was very severe. Reports from nil points as far as San Bernardino in dicate that the storm was general. Silly Chill. Valparaiso. December 14. The substanco of President Harrison's statement of Chilian affairs was received and is a subject of uni versal comment. It is remarked by the Chil ians as decidedly threatening a rupture, as it is believed that the Chilian government will net consent either to apology or any material indemnity, ine majority in congress is known to be opposed to any concessions and the Chilian government would find it diffi cult to carry tho necessary support of any humiliating measures. It is now no secret that the government is proceeding actively with warlike prepara tions, and that artillery of the latest manu facture has been ordered from Germany. The situation is complicated by Spain's demand for largo indemnity. The Chilians have always detested the Spanish. They would challenge Spam if they had not the United States to deal with. Captain Schley declined to express any opinion for the pub lic as to the president's message, but it was evident that he was pleased with it. Murderous. Desvxb, December 15. The strike of the miners at the mines of the Colorado Coal and Iron company, at Crested Butte, result ed much more seriously than the firm antic ipated, and there are yet indications of further bloodshed before the matter is set tled. Two weeks ago 500 Austrian and Italian miners, who were employed at these works, went on a stnke because of a pro posed reduction announced by the company. Since the men went out they have been very ugly, refusing to allow the company to bring in new men. and have stopped the pumps and fans at the worKs, allowing them to fill with gas, until there is danger of the mines blowing np. They parade the streets heavily armed, threatening death to any one who should attempt to assist the company in any manner. Crippled by Grippe. Tofeca, December 15. The Santa Fe shop and yard forces are crippled in every depart ment by the gnppe. ' Every day several new cases develop, thus add ing to the inconvenience occasioneo. This is a particularly busy season because of the extra work incident to the preparing of cars for immediate use. . N Three extra freight trains go east every day loaded with grain and six trains west to carry cars to the wheat country, although not many empty cars arc sent out, the sup ply of cars here being barely sufficient to carry the grain from Shawnee county and vicinity. Storms In the United Kingdom. London, December 14. The severe storm which has been raging over the' British Isles for day3 continues with unabated violence, cansiag much damage to shipping and other property. Floods in various parts of Eng land are again playing a proriaeat part ia the work of destruction, and are iafictfsg further damage upon the farmers, who aavf already suffered so much this year. la fact, several years of uninterrupted prosperity will be necessary in many districts to mak up for what the agricultural communitiet have lost, owing to the series of frightful storms which have swept over the land. Liyxhfool. The gale which has prevailed all over Great Britain increased here to the fury of a hurricane. The wind blew at the rate of forty-eight miles an hour.' An im mense amount of damage has been done and numerous wrecks are reported, the most important being the steamer "Eiffel Tower, which has been wrecked at Formby. The crew sre.believed to have been saved. Lojtdos. The gale which began Thursday night continues, but has increased in velocity and is raging here with unabated fury; alsc in Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Another Prompting1. St. Pact, Mixx.,December 15. The alli ance organ, the State, is out with anothei "hold your wheat" circular, and presents the usual array of figures to show the farmei that he will profit by following the advice laid down therein. It holds that Russia is en tirely out of the race and India practically so, and that present and future deliveries from farmers will fill but a small portion oi the requirements. It does not advise the farmer to create an unnecessary scarcity oi repudiate his debts, but to sell only what he is obliged to when the receipts are large and increasing, and when they are on the decline to sell only a certain portion each month. The exporting capacity of the United States is figured at 140,000,000 bushels more than last year, which falls 40,000,000 short of sup plying the world's deficit. Taking all ttne into account, the author of the circular claims that if the farmer does not get twice what is now offered for his wheat, it is his own fault. Neither of the Wilsons. New York, December 15. The man who threw the bomb at Russell Sage has at last been identified seemingly beyond reasonable doubt as Henry L. JS'orcross, a well known Boston note broker. After identification in Boston by his tailor and his parents of the buttons and remnants of clothing found after the explosion, to make the chain of evidence complete a re porter persuaded H. M. Howes, a former schoolmate of Norcroes, to come to the city to examine the bomb-thrower's head at the morgue. Howes arrived at 9 o'clock. He was met at the Grand Central Btation and taken to the morgue. He positively identified the heal as that of his former schoolmate, Harry L. Norcross. Peake Acquitted. Kansas City, Mo., December 15. William Peake, ex-city treasurer, who has been on trial in the cnminal court during the past week, charged with having embezzled $20,000 of the city's money, has been acquitted. The jury brought in its verdict at 2:30 o'clock having been out for twenty-four hours. A deficiency of $20,000 in the treasury funds was clearly proved, and the greater amount of the deficiency was accounted for by "I. O. U's" found in the cash drawer, signed by Peake. The defense was that these slips originally represented the amounts drawn by Peake against his salary, but that they were raised by clerks in the office, who really got away with the money. A Crank Kicked Out of Doors. Alton, III., December 15. A well dressed stranger walked into the office of the Illinois Glass works, in this city, and asked for the millionaire propnetor, illiam Eliot Smith. He was not in. and the man was asked what he wanted. He replied to Charles Levis that he wanted $1,000,000. Mr. Levis 6aid that he had not that much change on hand, but would give him all ho had, and seizing the strangei by the nape of the neck and the seat of the pants, he threw him out the door. A few well-directed and judiciously admin istered kicks caused the stranger to change his mind as to wanting the money. He took his painful departure in an eastwardly di rection. Another Chilian Outrage. Valparaiso, December 15. Another case of cruelty to American seamen occurred here recently. The American steamer Eeewanee, from new New York, stopped hero for re pairs a month ago. One cr her crew, a sailor named Shields, was arrested in Valparaiso for drunkenness. Tho man admitted he was drunk, but, he says, ho was given no hoaring at all and refused permission to communi cate with the captain of his vessel or tho consul. He was kept at work cleaning tho streets for more than a week and brutally neaten by the police. When released he was scarcely able to walk. His back and arm were a mass of bruises and he also received severe internal injuries. Consul McCreery has laid the matter before the authorities. Mexican Affairs. Crxr or Mexico, December 15. Mail ad vices from Colima say that on the 3d instant the eruptions of the volcano wero unusually grand. The first took place at 3 in the after noon, 'preceded by a rumbling underground noise. Tho second was at 5 o'clock. In both eruptions large masses of las a rushed down the sides of the mountain. A lurid column of firo bursting forth sent up masses of smoke, which, like largo bodies of clouds, filled the heavens and made a magnificent spectacle. All through the night a rain of ashes fell in the town of Collimaand through out the neighborhood. In Haytois the streets and houses were covered thickly with it, as with snow. New Mexico Wind. Albuquerque, N. M., December 15. The torra raged here all day. A review of its work places the loss at about $15,000. In the night the storm raged with increased inten sity, traveling 'westward at tne rato or sev enty miles an hour. The third story of the immense flour mills came down at midnight with a crash. The roof was blown 200 feet away. The Atlantic fc Pacific machine shops are badly wrecked. The storm is the worst ever experienced in this valley. The Coming- Royal Marriage. London, December 14. Arrangements fot the marriage of the Duke of Clarence and Avondale were, it is understood, discussed by the cabinet. Although the act of 188S bars a special grant to the duke, the minis ters hold that a dowry can be voted to th princess, Victoria Mary. The Prince of Wales will visit ths queen at Windsor to state the intention of the mia- ietera. m Where is the Bridegroom? DuBi7QT7K, Ia., December 14. Fred Boomer and Miss Luella Thomas were to be married at Waukon, but when the time came for the ceromony the bridegroom had mysteriously disappeared. No one knows where he has gone. His father is a banker at Waukon, and the prominence of the parties made the affair decidedly sensational. The Lottery Wins. New Orleans, La., December 15.

Repre sentative workingmen, connected with al most every manufacturing industry, and coming from every section of the country, to the number of several hundred were gathered in Erswell's hall when President Samuel Gompers, of New York, called to order tho eleventh annual convention of the American Federation af Labor. The president proceeded to deliver a brief address of welcome. "It was," he said, "the largest convention of the federation in its history. The growth of the organization dunng the past year has been phenomenal, and the delegates before him represented more than three-quarters of a million of organized labor." The financial exhibit showed that the re ceipts of the year had been $21,346 and the total expenditure $13,199, leaving a balance of$8,156. Of the total expenditures nearly $2,500 represented loans und donations to organizations on strike. The statement of expenditures was ren dered notable by the item showing that tho otal outlay for salaries on account of organ ization with hundreds of branches and a membership of three-quarters of a million was but 4,3)0. Iho comparative sum mary showed that four jears ago the total receipts of the organization were but S2.000 for the entire jear. During the past year a loan of $3,S00 had been made to the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of Pittsburg, Pa., to aid them in their strike, and it has since been repaid in full. Two thousand dollars hao also been loaned to the United Mino Workers of Amer ica, to aid tho Iowa striking miners. Tho convention will be asked to make the loan a donation. The Santa Fe'3 Blur Sale.

It is expacted that one of these lines will bo in operation during the world's fair. Senator Plumb Tired. Washington, D. C, December 16. Senator Plumb has been "out of sorts" ever since his arrival in Washington. He was almost worn out when he went to Kansas last fall, and his campaign work and other business, which he was obliged to attend to while in Kansas, gave him no time for recuperaticn. His work in Washington during the past year has been extremely arduous, and his physi cian has told him that the overworked condi tion of his system demands rest. He has decided to leave Washington immediately after the adjournment and be absent uatil the reassembling of congress, which will probably give him two weeks' rest. He will not return to Kansas, but just where this short vacation will be spent he will not know for a day or two. He would like to take a trip to the Bermudas, but it is not likely he will have time now. - Destructive Flood. Panama, December 16.
