Do we own the Philippines or are we still fighting for their possession?- The cables tell of four soldiers killed in battle. 26 Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Mon roe would have been sitting; In 1857 61, Van Buren, Tyler, Fillmore and Pierce. Since 18C8 the number of sen ators of the ex-presidential class would never have risen above two. It Is pos sible that the very fewness of surviv ors of presidential terms in any recent time has militated against national ac tion that would keep them in public life. To develop Rock Island industrially and commercially, there must be op portunity for plenty of roads to enter from the west. An Illinois dairyman boasted his cows milk was so rich that it passed the test even after being watered. His vanity cost him $50. Kentucky's man and woman who kept a plighted troth for 44 years would not require a trial marriage to determine their felicity. When Count Castellane arose to ad dress the French chamber of deputies more than half the membership left the hall. France is not as bad as painted. During all these years the effete east has got all from the government that was coming to it and then some. . Now give the Mississippi valley a chance. No ship subsidy just yet. The recommendation of the presi dent of a graduated income tax re minds us that William J. Bryan, just before he started on his tour around the world, stated he was thinking ser iously of getting an injunction against Theodore Roosevelt to keep him from taking planks from the democratic platform. It Is feared that Mr. Bryan has delayed the move too long; but perhaps a writ of restitution is still available. Mark Twain's Temerity. Mark Twain, 71 years "young," has celebrated his perennial youth by set ting a new winter fashion in dress Arrayed in the whitest of serge appar el, he has made Washington shiver with astonishment. The burden of amazement is over Mark's temerity in departing from the prevailing style. But he is young-old or old youn enough to assert a sartorial Individ uality. In fact Dr. Clemens means that his defection in raiment shall be inter preted as an open attack on the "frights" to which man is condemned by freakish arbiters. He may not yet realize what mischief he is likely to play with the manly mode. Wbat he has done In a perfectly natural course of evolution others may dare to do. In stead of postrlty cherishing his mem ory as that of the greatest joker, it is apt to remember him as the great apostle of freedom in dress. When he claims this snow white suit as his uniform, Mark is simply insist ing upon everyone inventing his own line of wardrobe. He admires the peek-a-boo waists and the low necks and the short sleeves, but he sharply notes that none of them are alike while the men folks look like crows in evening dress and mudhooks in their daily dingies. Mark's effort In his "cheerup' clothes is simply carrying out his philo sophy that a man is as young as he feels and "glad rags" help him to realize immortal youth. Although Senator Piatt of New York Is feeble in the extreme and moves about only with great difficulty he has savage aversion to anyone hinting at his condition. He tottered out of the senate while the president's message was being read and made for a wait ing carriage. A stiff breeze blew his coat tails wildly about and his thin frame shook like a reed. A capitol policeman made bold to take hold of the old man's arm as he tried to mount the steps of the carriage and assist him to enter. Fiercely the New Yorker turned on the cop. "What are you do ing, sir?" snarled the senator. "Only trying to help you in your carriage, sir." politely replied the bluecoat, with a tremor In his voice. "Get away from me," snapped Senator Piatt imperious ly; "I don't need the help of you or anybody else to get into my carriage," The policeman scooted back to his post. Question of Ex-Precldents. The story of Mr. Roosevelt's desire to enter the United States senate at the close of his career In the VrhIte bouse, is still in circulation, says the New York World. Meanwhile, John Bigelow renews and presents In pamphlet form his argument for a con stitutional amendment under which re tiring presidents shall become sen ators without further action. "Our Ex-Presidents," reads Mr. Bigelow's ti tle; "What Shall We Do for Them? What Shall They Do for Us?" The idea of giving senatorial places to former chief magistrates of the re public is very old. Under discussion, it has presented always as a splitting A Matter of Great Importance. The problem that has arisen over the assessment for storm drain pur poses, of the tract of land presented to the Rock Island Industrial commission for factory development, is one that should command the earnest consider ation of the city council, and that body should do all in its power to give sanc tion and encouragement, to a project of such vital importance to the city. The generous donors of the land placed at the disposal of new industries, had no intimation of the fact that an assess ment had been levied against it, amounting, practically, to confiscation of the ground, owing to the fact that the ordinary means of notification were ignored in this instance and it was not until the Industrial commis sion had taken control of the ground for the purposes designed and had al ready secured one new factory that the actual situation developed. The storm drain proposition is an important one in itself, and it is to be regretted that any proceeding in con nection with its construction should have arisen, that might just have been avoided at the proper time. As it is, the council is confronted with a condi tion that demands immediate adjudica tion, for upon it depends the carrying forward of the great work that has been undertaken by the Industrial commission for pushing forward Rock Island's new factory district. The Argus, for its own part, has no doubt that the council will be equal to the emergency that presents itself and will without delay give its cooperation to the efforts that are being made to convert unused lands in the lower end of the city to a hive of industry. illions Spenl fo Halco Glean Boor Cleanest Manufacturing Process Ii That or An American Brewery. We regard beer as a food and the business of brewing beer one of our most important Industries. When we tell our readers that without exception there Is no other brewery in the world so absolutely clean In its process of manufacture as Pabst, we speak from exact knowledge of conditions. The monster Pabst Brewery at Milwaukee represents an outlay of millions of dollars and many of those millions have been expended to make the Pabst exclusive process absolutely clean. Pabst Beer stands alone today, the only food product that from the beginning point of opinion the question as to the J01 5nd i ,ts manufacture is abso v . , . lutely beyond reach of even the con- vuuiig power in me new ciass oi sen ators. Mr. Bigelow meets the point squarely. "Each senator shall have one vote." This is a proposition to overthrow the principle of state equal ity in the senate, without the accept ance of . which the constitution itself would have failed of adoption. Objec tions to this change are not met by Mr. Bigelow's argument based upon differences in state populations. It was because there were big states and smaller ones that the rule of two senators each was fixed. Representa tion on a popular basis was left to the other house of congress. Until the last spark of jealousy be tween states shall be extinguished there will be little hope for Mr. Bige low's scheme entire. General consent might be obtained to a proposition that former presidents should sit as honor ary members and advisers of the sen ate. But this position of limited use fulness would scarcely satisfy the as pirations of a man like Mr. Roosevelt, leaving the presidency as he will do at El. still full of strenuous impulses and Ideas. Had It been arranged at the begin taminating germs of the air. Doctors boll their Instruments in water to sterilize them. Pabst boils his brew In closed kettles and thus sterilizes It. From there It passes through sterilized pipes to sterilized hermetically sealed tanks where It Is fermented. Then through more sterilized pipes it goes to sterilized hermetically sealed storage tanks and when bottled it is pasteurized. Throughout the entire process it never Is touched by human hands and comes in contact only with sterilized air. This process of manufacture is the exclusive Pabst method. It Is one rea son for the "always the same, always the best" reputation of Pabst Beer. The cleanest beer and the richest beer, Pabst Beer has no equal as a mild, healthful beverage. It is brewed only from Pabst eight-day malt, choicest hops and pure water. Pabst eight-day malt,, the perfect malt, con tains all the food qualities of the finest barley in predigested' form. It is this high food value and the Pabst exclu sive process of brewing and thoroughly aging the beer, that gives Pabst beer Its rich, mellow flavor, its refreshing zest. M.
