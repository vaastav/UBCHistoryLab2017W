London, Dec. 7.—(By The Associated Press.)—With the tension and anxiety of the past weeks giving place to general rejoicing this has been a day of all around congratulations, of recalling the memories of great figures in the Irish struggle, whose work and sacrifices, paved the road to today's accom plishments, and of preparations for the necessary formalities for bringing the new Irish Free State into being. Nowhere is there a real idea that<^ Nowhere is there a real idea that<^ anything can now happen to prevent it« birth, nlthough differences of de tail may have to be encountered. King George and David Lloyd George, to whom the public accords chief credit for bringing about peace, were photographed together in a smil ing group of his majesty's ministers on the terrace of Buckingham palace Wednesday. Premier Praised Dining street, where stands the Official residence of the prime min ister, was inundated with telegrams of congratulations from all over the world. The premier presented to Lady Greenwood, the wife of Sir Hamar Greenwood, chief secretary for Ire land, the pen with which he signed the Irish treaty, as "an appreciation of your husband's efforts for peace." Preparations are afoot in London, Dublin and Belfast, for the considera tion of the treaty. The king has sum moned parliament to meet at West minster, December 14, to ratify tfre treaty, and cabinet councils have been summoned at Dublin and Belfast. De Valera Silent Eamonn de Valera has as yet given no hint of his attitude but it is gen erally assumed, as the delegates to the London conference were plenipo tentiaries, that the treaty will be ap proved, at least in principle. Oppo sition seems to be expected from the extremists both in Dublin and Bel fast. Sir James Craig, the Ulster premier, in a public speech in the Belfast par liament Wednesday, adopted a rather non-committal attitude, guarding him self against any jjirect opposition to the settlement. But in a statement sent to a political meeting through his wife, he took a sanguine view that peace would soon be achieved, and rep resented as a victory for Ulster the freedom of choice accorded her by the treaty. It is believed that Ulster will not at first send representatives to the all Irelan'' parliament, but will wait to see the effect of the new regime be fore deciding upon what course to adopt. Await Ulster's Reply The signing of the treaty has been received joyfully by the labor party, a joint manifesto was issued by the va rious bodies comprising the party, ex pressing satisfaction and the hope that Ulster would wholeheartedly adopt the agreement, and also appealing to the Belfast worTcers to secure industrial peace in the interest of industrial trade solidarity. The Irish delegates on leaving Lon don Wednesday night for Dublin hud a widely enthusiastic send-off from thousands of London Irish men and women, gathered in Euston station. The Ulster cabinet resumed consid eration of the proposals. Mr. Lloyd George's secretary is waiting at Belfast for Ulster's reply but this is certain to be delayed in view of the Ulster premier's desire to investigate the details of the agree ment signed by the British government and the Sinn Fein delegates. "Wet Newspapers" Are Obstacle in Way of Drys, Claim Washington, Dec. 7.—"Wet news papers" were described to the anti saloon league Wednesday as the first obstacle to complete enforcement of prohibition, in an address by General Superintendent P. A. Baker. Behind this obstacle, he said, are "Judges, sheriffs, prosecuting attorneys, may ors and city solicitors," who seem not to have learned that the 18th amend ment has been adopted. Rev. Mr. Baker referred to the query attributed by Lord Northcliffe, during his recent visit, of "when does pro hibition begin in this country?" as "impudent," and declared that the Brit ish publisher returned home "to pub lish false articles" on the subject. "Publicists of the Northcliffe type," he said, " will greatly add to the mor al standards of this republic by stay ing home."

Washington, Dec. 7.—The Republi can party's leadership from President Harding down was assailed in a speech in the senate Wednesday by Senator Harrison, Democrat, Missis sippi, who declared Mr. Harding was doing "the very things for which he as a seuator had denounced President Wilson." The president's message to congress Tuesday, he added, consti tuted an appeal to partisanship and warning to Republicans to disavow their allegiance to "bloc" organiza tion. Refers to Wilson. When Mr. Wilson opposed or urged legislation, Mr. Harrison continued, then Senator Harding described him as a "dictator and an autocrat," and when Mr. Wilson issued his appeal in 1918 for the election of a Democratic congress, Mr. Harding was equally bit ter in his denouncement . "Yet we have the spectacle," he said, "of i he president coming here and making a speech against the soldier bonus, a thing unprecedented. Then Tuesday, he came here and appealed to the agricultural group to line up to behind the party banner.

City officials declared that starting of additional paving and high way projects in Livingston would soon relieve 4}e unemployment situation herey Orientals Clear Path for Satisfactory Deal Involving East Problem Washington, Dec. 7.—(By the As sociated Press)—Optimism prevailed in both Japanese and Chinese circles Wednesday night over the prospect of a satisfactory solution of far eastern questions at the Washington confér ence, as a result of meetings Wednes day at which many of the involved prob lems were discussed. The important developments included: Adoption of a resolution involving the preservation of the territorial in tegrity of China, giving her control over all foreign wireless stations on Chinese soil. Adoption of a resolution providing for the neutrality of China in future wars to which China is not a party. Agreement by the Japanese delega tion, subject in part to approval by Tokia, that all public property in the Kiao Chow leasehold of the Shantung province, be transferred to China. A tentative agreement by the Jap anese delegation to delay no longer than Saturday, further discussion of control of the Kiao Chow-Tsinan Fu railway in Shantung. Somewhat offsetting the progress made toward settlement of points of contention between China and Japan were assertions and denials of further resignations and dessensions in the Chinese legation. Dr. Alfrd Sze, Chinese minister to Washington, and one of China's lead ers, denied there had been any resig nations of high officials other than that of Dr. Philip K. C. Tyau as general secretary, which was announced Mon day. In other Chinese sources, it was in sisted that Admiral Tsai Chow Tsu Chi and General Huang Fu, superior advisers had resigned through displeas ure with the manner in which the Shantung controversy was being treat ed. Efforts to obtain direct state ments from these officials, however, were without avail. At the meeing of the Far Eastern Mrs. Obenchain Predicted Death of Kennedy, Claims Witness in Burch Trial Los Angeles, Dec. 7.—A conversa tion in a beauty parlor, involving a prediction of the death of J. Belton Kennedy, was the major topic of the testimony Wednesday in the trial of Arthur C. Burch. accused of murder ing Kennedy. The conversation was described by Mrs. Mary A. Bailiff, of I.os Angeles, who said Mrs. Madalynne Obenchain, accused jointly with Burch, had made the prediction of Kennedy's death. Long cross-examination failed to change her story. Mrs. Bailiff said she met Mrs. Oben chain first at the beauty parlor last spring. Later, she said, they met again at the same place, and she de scribed to Mrs. Obenchain a dream she had had, in which she saw Mrs. Ob enchain on a country road with a crowd approaching. "I couldn't tell whether it was a funeral or a wedding procession," the witness declared, and added she thought it strange she should dream such a thing about a stranger, where upon Mrs. Oberchain said: "I know exactly what it meant. I feel something is going to happen. Bel ton will soon pass out." And later she said "Belton will soon pass out. I could almost put my hand on the spot where it will happen." Asked how she knew who was meant by "Belton," Mrs. Bailiff said Mrs. M. I,. Wilson, proprietor of the beauty parlor, had told her "Belton was Madalvnne's sweetheart." Mrs. Bailiff said Mrs. Obenchain on July 25 invited her to luncheon with her at the hotel where Mrs. Obenchain was stopping and she did so no July 12. Then, she went on, Mrs. Oben chain told her she "would never marry Belton." "1 asked her why, and she answered because he had deceived lier," the wit ness continued. During the same conversation, Mrs. Bailiff testified, Mrs. Obenchain call ed Kennedy a "degenerate." "Did she say she would mot marry him because he was a degenerate?" Defense Attorney Paul W. Schenck asked, in cross-examination. "No, she said she would not marry him because he had deceived her." The witness said Mrs. Obenchain telephoned her to come to the hotel August 1 and when she did so. told her Kennedy had come to her room at 10 o'clock "the night before and urged her to marry him. , "She said he had a revolver with him and took it out and laid it on a dress er," the witness said. "Later he put it in the bath room and she said she got it and that he struggled with her for three hours trying to get it away from her. She said she knew it would be safe with her but. she didn't know what he would do with it. He stayed until 3 o'clock in the morning, she said, and during that time his par ents called up twice on the telephone trying to find him. "I said: 'It seems to me if you want ed to marry him you ought to have done it when he asked you.' "She said: 'It's his parents. What he has is tied up in his father's bus iness. He said his mother would com mit suicide if he married me'.' Sirs. Obenchain also said, according to the witness: "I wonder how long he thinks lie can play with me and get away with it ?" On another occasion the witness said Mrs. Obenchain had Baid: "I feel I am going to see Mrs. Peete and talk with her. I can just see my self in jail." Mrs. Louise L. Peete« committee Wednesday, when it resum ed its sessions after a three-day pst, Dr. ^Wellington Koo, on behalf of China, made a statement concerning Manchuria and other leased territories in China in response to the Japanese position taken at the meeting last week, "that it would not at this time" withdraw from that province. There was said to have been con siderable further discussion of leased territories in China, but no final agree ment was reached, the Chinese and Japanese delegates explaining that their separate negotiations regarding Shantung were somewhat involved in the conference question of leased ter ritories and that therefore it was con sidered advisable to make further headway with the Shantung negotia tions before further commitments should be made in the Far Eastern committee relating to leased territory. Dr. Koo, in his presentation of Chi na's case regarding Manchuria did not accept the Japanese view of Japan's right to remain in Port Arthur and Dalny, nor the British view concern ing the nation's occupation of Kow loon, on the mainland opposite Hong Kong. Dr. Koo's reference to the Japanese interpretation of the consortium and America's assurance regarding Man churia brought from Secretary Hughes the statement that the posi tion of the United States when the consortium was arranged was - clearly set forth in the full correspondence made public several months ago and that it spoke for itself. This, it was recalled, stated that 'the consortium should not be used to the detriment of any single nation's interests in China. The question of foreign troops in China again came up for consideration at a meeting of the sub-committees on draft. Statements were presented by the Japanese and Chinese delegates, but were not made public, and further consideration went over until Thurs day. ' convicted of the murder of J. C. Belton, is in the Los Angeles county jail. It was brought out in the cross-ex amination that Mrs. Bailiff repeated these conversations to several persons, including an attache of the Los Ange les public defender's office. Word of them reached District Attorney Wool wine for the first time last night and he went to her home with J. I). Kenne dy. father of the slain man, and secured her statement. Mrs. Bailiff, also in cross-examin ation, said she had visited Mrs. Oben chain in the county jail. "Didn't you tell Mrs. Obenchain there you wanted to help her all you could for you believed her innocent?" asked Attorney Schenck. "No." "Didn't you tell her Mrs. Wilson had talked too much and was hurting her case?" "No. She said Mrs. Wilson had lied before the grand jury. I told her I didn't think Mrs. Wilson would do that and she had to talk a good deal about the case to persons who came to her place." She said Ralph I#. Obenchain, former husband of Madalynne, who was pres < i.t. suggested having a talk with Mrs. Wilson, and Mrs. Obenchain said: "Don't make her mad." Mrs. Wilson, next witness, identified several postcards and letters she said Mrs. Obenchain wrote her last June. In one of these was a reference to Kennedy, which contained the words: "This is his last chance." Mrs. Wilson was not questioned about the testimony of Mrs. Bailiff and it was announced that she would be colled as a defense witness. The last witness of the day was E. W. Cumniings. who testified that on the night that Kennedy was slain in Bev erly Glen, he saw an automobile parked in a side road near the scene of the slaying. He said he noticed it because "the dimmers were on the headlights." This was about 9 o'clock, he said. The prosecution contends Burch left a rent ed automobile at this spot while he lay in wait for Kennedy, in front of the lat tcr's sunnier cottage.

PRESENT'S PUN FOR FLEXIBLE RATE Penrose Expresses Opinion Congress Should Go Slow on Giving President Power. Washington, Dec. 7. — President Harding's suggestions for flexible ta riff rates and provisions for pro claimed American valuation apparently have been well received by many of the republican members of congress charged with the drafting of tariff legislation, but a formal decision on them by the senate finance committee is likely to be deferred uitil the actual rewriting of the house tariff measure is started, probably next month. Plan Is Favored Chairman Penrose, of the senate committee, plans to confer soon with the leading republicans of the house ways and means committee regarding the subject. Ile said Wednesday that he had heard much favorable comment on the president's suggestions. Senator Penrose expressed the opin ion that careful thought would have to be given to the manner of delegating authority to the president to change the rates or proclaim American valu ations as the basis for assessing duties as changing conditions might warrant. Amendments to the house bill prescrib ing the means of making the grant of authority already have been proposed by Senator Smoot. Utah, a member of the committee, and these were given study by members of the committees as well as other senators and house members. Continue Work Chairman Fordney. of the house ways and means committee, said he favored the drafting of a bill fixing minimum and maximum rates with authority for the president to fix the amount of duties between those figures at such intervals as conditions might warrant a change. Hearings on the house measure were resumed Wednesday by the senate committee under a schedule which will keep it in session almost every day from now until the Christmas holi days. The tobacco schedule occupied the committee today and tomorrow it will take up cotton manufactures. TO

Washington, Dec. 7. — President Harding transmitted to congress Wed nesday the annual report of the na tional' advisory committee for aero nautics with the recommendation that a bureau for the regulation and de velopment of air navigation be estab lished in the department of commerce as proposed by the committee. "I think there can be no doubt," the president said, in a message which ac companied the report, "that the de velopment of aviation will become of great importance for the purposes of commerce as well as national de fense. While the material progress in aircraft has been remarkable, the use has not as yet been extensively de veloped in America. This has been due, in the main, to lack of wise and necessary legislation. Aviation is destined to make great strides and I believe that America, its birthplace, can and should bo foremost in its de velopment." The report, which supplemented one made last April to the president, rec ommended continuation of the air mail service and development of aviation for military and naval purposes. InLM
