This is a mistake. A letter was yesterday re ceived from Col. Thoburn, stating that the imprudent lieutenants were Hall, of Capt. Melvin's company, and Freeman, of Capt. Stephens' company. They were captured at a place called French's, about nine miles from Romney, whilst they were vainly en deavoring to talk an old woman out of some butter. ,B&"Mittens for the Soldiers.?Capt.

This means, of course, that the campaign is over in Western Virginia, and that winter quar ter? are the only matters to be attended to at present. The campaign there has been a hard one, and our boys will doubtless be able at the close tff the war, to look back upon those mountains as the scene of the most trying experiences of the war. Much terrible marching and some (rood fighting has been done over and about the Western Virginia hills, but the rebels having given up the field in disgust, our men can now build their cabins and sit down to talk over the events of the vear.?Pitts. Chronicle. BiayROBBKRY AT THE McLl.UK HoUSE. Night before last, two or more of the nu merous young thieves who infest the city, went into the McLure House aud stole about a hundred dollars worth of clothing from the boarders. They raised the win dows and threw the clothing into an alley back of the house, and their confederates carried the articles away. The house was full of people, and the robbery was perpe trated at a very early hour in the evening.

Question.?t am a youth of eighteen years, have just completed my course at the Pub lit School, and am beginning to think at tentively concerning a business for life. I have not chosen an avocation. But what ever business I think of, I find will require of me some knowledge that I have not, j and which ray echool course neither inciu- 1 ded nor inculcated. Wealth, of course, is ! one of myjobjects, and I know it is to be i acquired by industry,- butig there notsome science of wealth, some fundamental rules, a 1 knowledge or which would aid roe In my abot 1 I ace men wasting their substance in law cuits. -t wiah to learn the relation : ctwecn ordinary business transactions and the laws of the country, that 1 may! avoid the vloletlftn of the latter, and so el- 1 cape litigation. Again, in our country,! ?where banks are eo numerous, whose is- I wait* most of the enrreocy, ii seems j 1 to me that every business man ought to un ; derstand the principles of Banking and Cur ; rency. Are there not also many valuable , maxims by men of wealth, in regard to ! the net of acquiring and managing pro. : perty ? Upsides these subjects, account ; antship must be indispensable to every intel ligent business man, to say nothing of its ! being of itself equal to a trade or art by : which to gain a livelihood. Can you, Mr. ! Editor, direct me to the most eligible books ; or other means of acquiring these various I branches of knowledge ? Answer.?Vortunateiy it is in our power to afford our correspondent the informa. ! tion he seeks. Mr. Hitchcock, a gentle man who possesses the treble advantage of ' being at once a practical business man, 11 j thorough accountant, and an urbane and skillful instructor, devotes his entire time to aiding young men in acquiring precise ly thosekinds of knowledge which our cor respondent asks for, and to him we com mend all who are similarly deficient.

(TKimwzn?, or From Missouri 1 Sedalia, .Mo., Dec. 5?Yesterday a p-ir ty ot' exasperated citizens, of all parties, attacked a gang of returned rebels from ? Price's army, under Oapts. Young and Wheatley, about 20 miles west of here, killing seven and wounding ten of them. Among tbe killed was Capt Young. None of the citizens were killed or severely ; wounded. Tbree of the wounded rebels i have since died. Judge Birch, who has been a prisoner iu Price's camp for some time past, arrived here to-day, having been released on pa I role. I Rolla, Dec. 5.?Advices from the South west say McCalloch has goue into winter quarters on Pea Ridge, near Bentonsville, Benton county. Ark., where he is putting up barracks for his troops. Nothing definite is known of Price's movements. Gen. MuBride was at Springfield with ^,000 men on Sunday last. St. Louis, Dec. 5.?Gen. Thos. L. Price, commanding at Jetfetaon City, will run for j Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the ' I expulsion of John \V. Reid. Judge Wo, A Hall, member of the State Convention, and M. C. Hawkins, have been named for the race in the district lately , represented by John B Clark. Both are understood to be stroug Union men. Kansas City, Dec. 5.?By order of Gen. j Hunter, Col. Jennison's regiment moved U> a point midway between Kansas City and : Leavenworth yesterday. All communication between here and Iudependen i3 cut off. The rebel Havs, with 300 men, visited Independence on Monday, and seized all the horses belonging to the Pacific Stage Company, and made a geueral confiscation of all the property of Union citizens. St. Joseph, Dec. 5.?Gen. Prentiss made a speech to a large crowd ot citizens here yesterday, in which he said, ''As God is my judge, evert" secessionist in this city shall take an oath of allegiance to the U. S. Government and to support the Stars and Stripes, or I will send them to work oil the trenches of Fort Smith, and all per sons who are hereafter found expressing secession sentiments shall take the oath." The speech caused great consternation among tlic secessionists, and was received with applause by the loyal citizens. Troops were sent down to Platte county last night to look after Sigordon's band of rebels. Sedalia, Dee. D.?Our latest advices from the South are that Price has removed a part of his force from Oscela to a point 5 miles distant, where he has established bis headquarters, Gen. Rains' command remained at Osce ola. A train of DO wagons, fiomx Lexington, laden with supplies for Price's army pass ed unmolested within IS miles of this pinri- on Monday last. There are four recruiting ollire> o;i*n in Lexington, enlisting recruits fur I'rie. 's army. Meetings have been held in Lexington and in Clay, Ray and other river counties, urging a united effort in behalf of the reb els, and subscriptions for money, clothing, are in circulation. It is believed to be a fact that the Coun ty Court of Saline County (CI lib Jackson's residence) in July last authorized Commis sioners to raise $100,000, to be expended for the benefit o! Price's army. Oilier counties alongthe Missouri are believed to have done the same thirg. It is stated on good authority that when Price was beseiging Lexington a delega tion of citizens was sent to him from Saline cotin'y, with an urgent request that lie -bould not allow his army to enter that county, which was complied with. The renson.for this request was the dread en tertained by the inhabitants of the plun dering propensities of Price's rebels. The counties on the Missouri river west of Jefferson City are the richest iu the State, and have furnished as many men and as much means in behalf of tlie rebel lion as the balance of the Slate, while they have been almost entirely exempt Iroin marauders, and have been rarely visited by Federal troops. Leavenworth, Dec. G.?Brig. Gen. J. \V. Denver has arrived, and has been as signed to the command of all the Kansas regiments. A portion of Lane's brigade remains at Fort Scott. The Fourth regiment is ordered to Wyandotte. TheFirst Cavalry, known as Jennison's regiment, is stationed at Johnny Leake in tbe Delaware Reservation, nearly opposite Parksville, Mo. The Second regiment is nearly recruited, and will occupy the village of Kic.ipoo, 10 miles above this city. The river remains open, but trouble is anticipated with marauding parties when it freezes over. Trains are again running on the Platte Count}' road, and our mail communications east are re-established. Kentucky Legislature Louisville, Ky., Dec. G.?K. F. Bnrnes, I)isuuiou,of Owen county, offered a se ries of resolutions, iacluding a demand 00 the Federal Government for the return to Kentucky of Ex-Governor Moorchead and other political prisoners, and affirming that the President's Message foreshadows the impossibility of preserving or recon structing the Federal Union. Referred to the Committee on Federal Relations. The Union members to-night are itold a caucus to agree upon the resolutions re garding the present state of affairs, which will probably be offered to-morrow. New York, Dec. 6.?The Ship Yorkshire from Liverpool, reports on the 28th Nov., in hit. 44? 14', long 60? 41', passed a steamer, bark rigged,showing the rebel flag. She appeared to have lost her bulwarks. She had a spread Eagle on her stern and a white wheelhouse. She was steering South East. The steamer Vauderbilt arrived to-day, and will return to Port Royal im mediately, with Quartermasters supplies. The steamer Baltic sailed this morning for Fort Pickens, with the 75th N. YorkReg iment. The French steam frigates Pomore and Calinet sailed to-day. The steamer Bavaria has arrived from Southampton. Her dates are to the 20th ult., and have been anticipated. The U. S. steam transport steamer Van derbilt has arrived from Port Royal. She left on the 3d inst., but brings no news of importance. The town of Beaufort is still unoccupied. -? Loctsvjlle, Dec. 6.?The steamer Pinlt Varble, from here with a c?tton mill ma chinery, proceeding to Nashville tinder a oermit from Secretary Chase, was seized i>y the rebels, and ts held by Lieut. Mc Gavoch, commander at Fort Donelson, awaiting orders from Gen. Johnston. The machinery was taken to Nashville. The Louisville papers unanimously con tlctDU tbe policy of Secretary Cameron In reference to the emancipation and pros pective arming of the tlave*. The Jour? ?at nays the President la equally censura ble. Prom Washington Washington, Dec. 6.?Lieut. Col. Rey nolds lias been appointed resideut agent at ort Royal, under the general regulations relative to securing and disbursing of tlie properly found or brought within the ter titory now or hereafter occupied by the U. S. forces in the disloyal States. He bus been ordered to report to the Secretary of the Treasury. A bill will soon bo introduced in Con gress authorizing the organization of a steam fire brigade, as a large amount ol government property has recently been de stroyed for want of some such organiza tion. There can scarcely be a doubt ot the passage of the measure. There are 4G persons from Maryland and Virginia in the county jail, arrested by .constables on presumption that they are fugitive slaves. A difficulty exists in the : way of their immediate discharge, from the fact that it cannot yet be ascertained ' whether they are all contraband and as I lojal citizens have the light to claim a surrender of their property. ,1( i Philadelphia, Dec. 6.?Papers contain I extracts from documeuts accompanying the Presidents Message relating to foreign af- j fairs in the course of Secretary Seward's ' instructions to Minister Adams. He says ! the President neither looks forr.or expects ! any actual and permanent dismemberment ! of the American Union, especially by a line ! oflatitude. The improvementof our many j channels of intercourse and the perfection : of our scheme of internal exchanges, and the incorporation of both of them into a ; great system of foreign commerce concur- j ring with the gradual abatement of the force of the only existing cause of alienn tiou, have carried us already beyond the danger of disunion in that form. The so j called Confederate States, therefore in the I opinion of the President are attempting ! what will prove a physical impossibility. Necessarilv.they build the structureof their j government upon the same principal bv i which they seek to destroy the Union, j namely, the right of each individual mem- j ber of the Confederacy, to withdraw from j it at pleasure and in peace. In another part ! the Secretary says : In short, all your ar- ! guments must belong to one of three classes' ' namely, first arguments drawn from the ! principles of public law and natural justice I which regulate the intercourse of equal | states. Secondly, arguments which con- ' cern equally the honor, welfare and hap- j ptness of the whole Union. Thirdly, argu- j ments which are equally conservative of ' the rights and interests and ever sentiments of the United States, and just in their bearing: upon the rights, interests and sen tments of Great Britain and all other na tions. And again Secretary Seward says, the President would regard it as inconsis tent with his habitually high consideration for thegovernmeutand the people of Great Britain to allow me to dwell longer on the merely commercial aspect of the question under discussion. Indeed he will not for a moment believe that upon the considera tion of merely financial gain, that the gov ernment could be induced to lend its aid to a revolution designed to overthrow the institutions of this country and involv ivg ultimately the destruction of the liber tics of the American people. The President will not dwell on the pleasant recollection that Great Britain,not a year ago, manifested, by a marked atten tion to the United States, her desire for a cordial reunion, which, all ancient pre judices and passions being buried, shall be a pledge of mutual sympathy and interest forever; therefore, the United States are not indifferent to the circumstances of a coiutnon descent, language, customs and religion, which recommend a closer sym pathy between themselves and Great Brit ain than either might expect in its inter course with any other nation. The States are one of many nations that have sprung from Great Britain herself. It has been thought by many who have studied modern history profoundly that the success of the nations thus deriving their descent from Great Britain might, through many ages, reflect back upon that kingdom the proper glories of its own great career. The Government nnd people ol Great Britain may mistake their commercial in terests, but they cannot become either un natural or indifferent to the impulse of an undying ambition to be distinguished as the leaders of the nations in the ways of civilization and humanity. From Fortress Monroe. Foktukss Monroe, Dec. 5, via Balti more, 0.?A flag of truce arrived from Norfolk to day, bringing several Charles ton passengers, but no news of any kind can be gleaned from them, except what is contained in the Norfolk Day Bool- of to day. It contains the message of Gov. Letcher to the Rebel Legislature of Vir ginia. One of the main points in it is the regret that Portress Monroe is not in the possession of the Southern Confederacy. The rebel Congress, at its session on the 3d inst., passed a resolution of thanks to Gen. Sterling Price, for his active services in Missouri during the campaign. Gov. Letcher uiges a forward movement and says that the batiks of the Potomac is not the place to fight, but the struggle should take place on the banks of the Sus quehanna. Gen. Wool also dispatched a flag of truce to Norfolk, with a number of letters and considerable clothing for the Union pris oners at Richmond. The steamer Illinois will leave this even ing for Port Royal, with troops for Gen. Sherman. The Richmond papers of the oth inst. contain the following news from the South : Savannah, Dec. 6.?Sixteen of the ene my's ships are now inside of the bar, and an attack on Fort Pulaski is hourly ex pected. The Richmond Dispatch of the 5th says that a report is current that Gen. Floyd's command has been ordered to another im portant post of duty. A telegram from Nashville, dated the 3d inst., says that Gen. Floyd has fallen back to within 30 miles of the Viiginia & East Tennessee Railroad. Baltimokk, Dec. 6.?The Stb New York Battaiion, which returned from the Eastern shore of Virginia, .yesterday, paraded this morning. Leaving Federal Hill, they marched through the city to General Dix's headquarters, bearing with them a large rebel flag captured in Dixie. The flag was carried Union down, On depositing it at the headquarters, the battalion gave three rousing cheers for General Dix and the American Union. New York, Dec. 0.?The ship Pampero nnd the Gunboats Dcsotn, Anderson and Seamen, were at Key West on 24th ultimo. The British Bark Callnda was abandoned at sen in a sinking condition on the second.

The British mail steamer for Martlnque arrived at St. Thomas on the 12th, and reported the pirate Sumter at Martinque. The United States gunboat troquols got up steam and started in pur suit. From Port Royal ( New Yohk, Dec. 6.?A letter from Port Royal, received by the steamer Vamlerbilt, , slates tliat the 79th New York Regiment made a reconnoissancc towards Charleston, capturing three batteries, and after spiking: the guns they returned, having approached within 20 miles of Charleston. A large amount of cotton was found raady for shipmeut, but the rebels were destroying most of it. About a thousand contrabands were em ployed about the forts, and others were coming in.

We are not aware of any prospective improvement in commerce to warrant these figures, which are much higher than in the baukrupt era of 1837 and 184", It is whispered about that some parties are placing all their funds iu Europe for iear, perhaps, the high way robbers of the world may penetrate our good city.
