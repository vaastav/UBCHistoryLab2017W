Tins enterprise, we believe, has now reached the footing anxiously hoped for by its friends. We arc going ahead, at least, in the right direction. The meeting on Tuesday, which was an adjourned one from the 23d of November last, received the reports of the various com mittees which had been appointed at the last regular meeting, and took several for ward steps toward the furtherance of the work, by appointing a committee to obtain from the Legislature an act ofincorporation, and also by continuing the Committees on Conference and Survey of Route and the general Executive Committee. An en gineer of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad Company has been here to take a general view of the country through which the road will probably pass, and has been since written to by the Com mittee on Survey, and is expected on at once, in accordance with his own appoint ment, to commence that part of the work. Upon its completion and his estimates, from actual surveys, a meeting will be convened to adopt the location of the road. Mean while the efforts of the friends of the work will be continued to secure the necessary amount of subscriptions, for upon this must depend, after all, whether the road is to be carried to a successful completion or the contrary. This is the one considera tion now to be anxiously looked to. The work is within the means of our people and can be accomplished ; but it can be accom plished only by continued and persistent effort and exertion. That it will be done we have every reason to expect, and there is now that shape in the enterprise which will make every effort tell. There is no mistake about the fact that our people are in earnest this time, and be ing so, results will be reached ‘that are solid and tangible. Nay, that is the great result already reached—that they arc in ear nest. It is regarded now as a business en terprise that will pay; and the best and shrewdest business men in our midst arc those who are giving it the most attention. We believe it is generally conceded—for we have heard many express themselves whose judgments in this matter are entitled to respect —that if this road shall not be built, and the effort now making fails, real estate in a large section of this county will rapidly depreciate in value, at all events it will not be marketable; for there will then be no inducements to offer pur chasers from abroad that we will probably in a short time be nearly connected by rail with the city of Baltimore or other outside markets—because the probability will then be rendered most positively and unequivo cally remote. The failure of the effort would most undoubtedly result in active consequences of disadvantage to us, which would be much worse than the negative disadvantage of not having attempted it. But, as we said before, we believe it is to be carried at last to a successful issue, for our real estate owners cannot afford to suf fer it to fail. The question of the route, as we predic ted, is now the one that, is exciting the greatest attention and interest. The nat ural anxiety prevails in each individual’s mind that it shall be made upon that lino which will contribute most to the value of his property or the convenience of his busi ness, consistently with the public interests. But it is a question which, it seems to us, must go fur to settle itself, when the differ ent routes are actually surveyed and the es timate for each is made by the engineer. The most direct and cheapest line will in evitably be adopted, unless inducements shall be offered to vary therefrom, by extra subscriptions, or actual work for the road when completed. These, it seems to us, are the considerations to be offered by any who shall advocate any other than such a route as above named. But these are legit imate reasons for a change, and if shown, should be listened to and weighed by the meeting of those interested, which shall determine the matter. At this end of the line we are aware that it makes little dif ference which way it shall go, within rea sonable limits ; but we nevertheless respect the opinions of those whoso interests and advantages are not upon so easy a footing. When the surveys, therefore, are to be made, every one should see that the advantages of a particular route of interest to him are fully ventilated—so there will be full data, at least, upon which to arrive at a correct conclusion. Meanwhile, we shall endeavor to keep •our readers posted in any news respecting the road, its actual prospects rather than speculations concerning it, and cordially invite co-operation, through our columns, in pushing forward the good work. The amount of subscriptions is now 100,350. The Mobile Weekly Reoisteu, the old est Democratic paper in the South, is said to have reached a larger circulation than was ever attained by any' journal south of Mason and Dixon’s line. It is full of interesting varied matter, having an able agricultural department, presided over by the veteran editor and successful agriculturist, Hon. C. C. Langdon. Its general literature, poetry, stories, &c., make it highly acceptable to the utlies The coining year will open with a new con tinued story, of deep interest, by one of the most distinguished writers of the day. The price was recently reduced to $3.00 a year, which, for so large a paper, (12 pages,) is extremely cheap. NEW 

YORK JOURNALISM. We have received, with a request to no tice, a cop}' of Theodore Tilton’s celebrated paper "The Independent" —and taken alto gether it is a specimen of Northern journal ism that deserves to be noticed. The con tributors comprise such names as Charles Sumner, Rev. Lyman Abbott and others of that class, who claim to Represent the “ad vanced ideas” of the time and nation. It claims also to be a religious journal, and the major part of its original contributions are furnished by authors with the prefix of Rev. before their names, and “holds to the com prehensive creed of the equal civil ami po litical rights of all American citizens, without distinction of color or sex,” according to its own declaration of principles. Beyond any doubt its circulation is immense, and its in* fluence, proportionate thereto, firmly estab lished in moulding, to some extent, public opinion al the North. By the fact of our re ceiving this number, we presume it is also endeavoring to extend southward its circula tion, and it becomes us to scan the features and appearance of the new-comer, and listen to the peculiar doctrines he professes to teach. The contents of this number are of varied style and composition, but in the main are simply changes rung upon the one idea of the superiority of the North over the South, and the keeping up of sectional distinctions, based upon the assertion of superior civili zation and culture. As a specimen of its claims upon our people, we give a few ex tracts from a “private letter to a friend,” by the "wife of a naval officer” visiting Rich mond, Va-, which is published on the first page. The lady is first attracted, of course, by a “fine-looking fellow,” a mulatto, who had never been in slavery, it is true, but nevertheless had seen a hard time generally, from the fact of his residence in the South.— After noticing his “musical talent” and that he is a ‘ wide-awake student, 1 she leaves him, first proposing to defray the expenses of his edu cation and giving him the opportunity to study music, and proceeds to "do" Richmond. Wc cannot, of course, describe the many ob jects of interest that met her notice there, but refer to one in particular, which was the famous Libby Prison—“no longer, according to our fair correspondent, “used as such, but as a mill for grinding sumac. It was filled with yellow dust—but I waded through it up the stairs into that fearful room where our poor hoys dragged through their months of agony. I told my husband it would he some relief to my feelings to knock down the one wlnteman on the premises; but I did?nt do it." “1 have a picture of the wicked old den.”— The italics In the aforegoing are ours. Wc only fear that that “naval officer,” unless he is an extremely “jolly tar” indeed, must have a serious time with a better-half who speaks j so composedly of knowing people down. Again says the lady, in reference to this wicked city of the South, “every body chews tobacco, from the small boys up,”—and she was in “mortal dread every where of being used as a spittoon.” Rut the closing remarks of the letter strike us as the most extraordi nary. One would naturally suppose that she fled in horror the accursed spot and from such uncouth people, and recurred withgloomy re collections to the period of her visit there. Not so. “On the whole,” she concludes, “/ have had a pleagant time" —but I am less a patriot for the journey, 1 fear, for 1 have made up my mind that our country south of Pennsyl vania is hardly worth bragging about. These people have nothing in common with us, not even the language.” “It is too much trouble to hate them.” Here is a specimen of what is daily pub lished and circulated broadcast among the masses al the North, by a journal of twenty one years standing, under the patronage and support of Senator Sumner and lead ing men of that class, whose gathering cry at the last election was, “Let us have peace.” It strikes us that it was a queer copy, containing the above letter, to send as a specimen “south of Pennsylvania”—which is all the comment we have to make. Henry Ward Beecher was at one time the editor of this paper. The public may have been shocked, to some extent, but we scarce ly think surprised, at the latest exhibition, ou the part of this gentleman, at the bedside and ou the occasion of the funeral of Rich ardson, in New York—a man overtaken in his infamy, and slain crimine delicto as it were, by an outraged husband, whose peace he had forever destroyed; but, as avowed by the Rev gentleman himself, in his funeral oration over his remains, because he had been loyal dur ing the war, his sins in this regard were not to be remembered. Loyalty is more than chari ty, if it can cover up crime of this revolting character. Wc do not believe our people “South of Pennsylvania” wish to learn of men such as these, and, as our fair correspon dent above noticed remarks that our "people have nothing in common” with them, we are sure wc can agree with her, to this extent, at least, that there arc many peculiarities and notions existing thare, which we hope wc shall never have in common with them or anybody else. -- THE NEWS. Recorder Hackftt, of New York, in his charge to the grand jury last week, in refer ence to the McFarland-Richardsou case, said in conclusion : “If there has been bigamy committed, aided or abetted by any persons, no matter how elevated in life they may be, fearlessly investigate the matter, and arriving at the fact of probable guilt, promptly in dict.” Beecher and Grcely are both making explanations in regard to the affair, with a view to clear their skirts of the odium incur red by them in connection therewith. —Four or five lives were lost at Parkersburg, West Virginia, on one day last week, by the steam er Rebecca, of the Wheeling and Parkersbuig line, colliding with Pier No. 4, and sinking. —The ladies of Baltimore realized about $12,000 from their proceeds of the fair held for the benefit of the Inellriate Asylum, and that institution is to be opened at once, with the services of Dr. St. Clair as resident phy sician, in a suitable building near the city— The great (Ecumenical Council at Rome was opened by the Pope on Dec.

CoNoiiEss.—The proceedings of Congress for the past week have not been produc tive as yet of many results, good or bad, except as looking to the coming occupa tion of that body for the remainder of the session. The Reconstruction Committee of the House has had the question of the admission of Virginia before it, and will no doubt report favorably for the re-ad mission of that State. A bill to define the powers of the. Supreme Court in certain cases, has also been introduced in the Sen ate. The bill to provide for taking the census has chiefly occupied the attention of the House of Representatives. Local Affairs. Christmas and ouh Mekchants.— Christ, mas is coming, and, in the language of one Of our enterprising citizens, the Bel Air and Fallston merchants “are ready for it.” For every thing you may wish in the li quor line—and who would not indulge in a little about Christmastime—see the advertise ments of L. Cahcn and Jos. E. Bateman & Co. For any' or everything else, read in our advertising columns the inducements offered purchasers by Herman & Ewing, Charles W, Norris & Bro., and A. 11. Greenfield. If you come from "down the pike,” let us candidly tell you that you may possibly save a longer ride by stopping at Fallston, at either Moore & Hollingsworth’s or Painter & Wat son’s, or both. The cold weather, too, may induce you to purchase stoves, etc., to provide a warm room in which to gather the family' group to celebrate the festivities of the season. If so, there is no necessity to look further than our friend I. Amos’ establishment, in this place. All of our merchants above named have provided for Christmas in away that bids fair to make the season this yearn merry one. We wish we could enumerate in detail the many beautiful and cheap goods offered by each, but wc arc conscious that an effort to do so would only result in a failure to do justice lo any. So we say to our citizens everywhere, call and examine for yourselves. You cannot go astray in any particular in dealing with any of our friends above enu merated- If you should wish a good, piping hot plate of oysters, at any lime, friend Lytle at the New Restaurant, on Courtland St., or A. J. Prigg, at the corner, will accommodate you iu that line, with the cl cetoras to suit- Fox Chase. —There was quite an excite ment in our usually quiet village, on Tues day morning last, at an early hour, caused by the gathering of hunters and hounds for a fox chase. The fox had been cap tured some days previous, by Mr. Samuel Scarff, near Col. 1!. McHenry’s Mill, in the first district, and notice having been given he was brought here on Tuesday and let loose just below the town for the sport. He was suffered to get some fifteen minutes start, when the hounds were put upon the trail and the chase commenced. Ho led his pursuers quite a round-about route, but was, we learn, finally brought to, about sundown, somewhere in the neighborhood of his first capture. Concert. —We call attention to the con cert to he given by Hr. Kerr and other friends, ladies #nd gentlemen, at the Court House, on Thursday, 23d Inst., for the benefit of the Presbyterian Church in this place. From the well-known character of Dr. Kerr, it is useless to say, that we feel assured that those patronizing this concert will be more than repaid. We understand that the entertain ment will not be entirely musical, hut will be varied by the introduction of elocutionary exercises of a comic character, performed by Messrs. Thompson and McCarrier. — Three Card Monte. —This morning James Morgan approached Sir. John T. Ayers, of Harford county, and requested him to drive out the Harford road with him, and to tlusMr. Ayers assented, and they drove out to a tavern just outside the city limits, where Morgan introduced Mr. Ayers to a man named M. Emmet, who said he was engaged in purchasing slock. After some conversa tion one of them introduced a board and throe card monte game, and inducing Mr, Ayers to bet, they swindled him out ofsll. — He, however, quickly appreciated the fact of his having been sold and called in to his as sistance officers Merrick and McKcwcn, who arrested Morgan and Emmet, carried them before Justice Oorsuch, who committed them for the action of the Baltimore county au thorities.—Baltimore Commercial of Wednrs day. ■ ■ Maryland Central Railroad.— A meeting of the friends of this road was ad vertised to be held on Tuesday lust, and in accordance with the notice a few of those interested gathered on that day in the Register’s office, in this place. No action was taken, and the meeting adjourned sine die, after a brief session. There has been a failure to procure the necessary amount of subscriptions, which is tire cause of the suspension of the cnterprizc. - Painful Accident. —We learn that an aged man, named John Andrews, residing near Webster's Mill, in this county, had his leg broken one day last week, by get ting his foot entangled in the lines of the harness, whilst driving his wagon to the mill, which caused him to fall and the wheel passed over the limb, causing the painful accident above mentioned.

An adjourned meeting of the friends of the Harford County Railroad was held at the Court House in Bel Air, on Tuesday, the 14th Dec., 1869, when James Kean, Esq., was called to the chair, and Geo. Y. May nadicr appointed Secretary. The chairman of the Committee on Con ference, Col. E. 11. Webster, reported that said committee had had an interview with Mr. Hinckley, President of the Phil., Wil. & Balto. Railroad, and stated the proposi tions offered by him—(a report of which was published in the proceedings of the Executive Committee, last week.) Gen. Wilson, one of the committee, also read a letter received, by him from Mr. Hinckley, stating that his (Mr. IPs) board would sustain him in the propositions offered. On motion, the report of the com mittee was accepted. The Committee on Survey of Route, re ported through its chairman, Wm. Young, Esq., that application had been made to the Phil., Wil. & Balto. Railroad Company, and the services of an engineer secured, free of charge, who had been in this county on yesterday (the 13th) and had looked at some portion of proposed routes, and who “would come on again, prepared to commence the surveys, when notified by the committee. On motion, the report of this committee was accepted. The general Executive Committee made the following report; 

REPORT OP THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE Your committee would respectfully re port : That they met in Bel Air, immediately after the adjournment of the public meet ing on the 23d of November, Col. Ramsay McHenry in the chair, and appointed George Y. Maynadier Secretary and Treas urer, and then adjourned to meet on the 25th of November. Your committee met on the 25thJof No vember, and appointed Wm. Young their agent to solicit subscriptions and donations for the construction of the Harford County Railroad, at a compensation of SIOO. Your committee met again, pursuant to adjournment, on the 2d of this month, and appointed a committe of six, viz: Messrs. Amos, Herman, Sawyer, Moore, Howard and others, to solicit cash sub scriptions to defray the preliminary expen ses of the road. Your committee mot again, pursuant to adjournment, on the 10th of this month, at which time it was resolved that their treasurer pay their agent his compensation when lie shall cull for it, and pay also all printers’ bills when presented. Your committee beg leave to report that up to this date they have obtained, princi pally through their agent, subscriptions for the construction of the Harford Coun ty Railroad, amounting to the sum of $00,350; that of this amount about $7,850 was subscribed on condition that the road should follow a certain designated route; but your committee hope and believe that tlie most if not all of the subscriptions will be made absolute, upon any route that the road will probably take. Your committee would further report that the sum of $73.58 has been collected to pay preliminary expenses, in view of the amount of subscriptions already ob tained, and the ascertained fact that very many persons deeply interested in the con struction of the road, living between Bel Air and its terminus, have not yet been called upon for subscription, and who will subscribe cay sot lees than $25,000, your committee believe that the construc tion of the road can be accomplished within a reasonable time, and would recommend that efforts to that end be continued with increased energy and zeal. Your commit tee have learned that the Phil., Wil. & Balto. Railroad Company have consented to furnish a corps of Engineers for the sur vey and location of our road, and would urge upon the Committee on Survey the necessity of pressing the surveys to comple tion at the earliest possible moment. Your committee beg leave to offer the following resolutions: Ist. Resolved, That a committee of six be appointed by the chair, to procure from the Legislature, at the earliest day practicable, an act of incorporation for the Harford County Railroad; one terminus of which road shall be at Bel Air, and the other at some point on the Phil., Wil. & Balto. R. R., lying in Harford County, witli the right to extend from the Bel Air terminus in any direction within said county. 2d. Rooked, That the Committee on Sur vey be requested to proceed without delay to make surveys of the various routes that have been or may be suggested for said road, and to prepare careful estimates of the cost of construction upon each route surveyed; and upon the completion thereof, said committee shall immediately report to the chairman of this meeting, who shall call a public meeting of the subscribers to assemble within two weeks of that date, to determine the location of said road. 3 d. Resolved, That the present Executive Committee be continued, for the purpose of procuring additional subscriptions, and that they lie requested to appoint a sub committee, residents of Harford, whose especial duty it shall be to solicit subscrip tions from the merchants and business men of Baltimore. The resolutions were taken up separately, when, on motion of Col. McHenry, the words “between the Bush and Gunpowder rivers” were inserted after the words “lying in Harford County,” in the first resolution. The resolutions, as amended, were then adopted. Wm. Young, Esq., then offered the fol lowing resolution, which was adopted : Resolved, That the present Committee of Conference be continued, and that they be and are hereby instructed to keep up their communication with the officers of the Phil., Wil. & Balto. Railroad Company in regard to the procurement of such terms from said road as will enure to the benefit of ours, and that they confer with the Maryland directors in said road to the same end. On motion of Col. E. 11. Webster, the name J. Crawford Neilson, Esq., was added to the Committee on Survey. The chair appointed the following named gentlemen as the Committee on Incorporation, as pro vided by the Ist resolution in the report of the Executive Committee, viz : 11. D. Far handis, 11. W. Archer, S. Archer, Jas. D. Watters, Col. RMcllenry and William 11. Waters. On motion of Col. McHenry, the follow ing resolutions were adopted: Ist. Resolved, That this meeting tenders it? thinks to the active and efficient agent of the Executive Committee, and acknowl edges the obligation of the friends of the road to the provisional Secretary and Treas urer, whose laborious and useful services were generously rendered without compen sation, 2d. Resolved, That we arc much indebted to the Bel Air press for kind countenance and spontaneous encouragement. We in voke a continuance of its favors, confident ly trusting that “its bread cast upon the wa ters” will be manifoldly returned through the accessions to its patronage which the increased trade, wealth and activity, arising from the construction of our road, will draw to its support. On suggestion of many gentlemen pres ent, Mr. Young made a statement of the re ception he had met with as canvassing agent for the road, and the prospects of raising sufficient means to inaugurate tbs work. Mr. Y. stated that lie regarded the prospects as encouraging in the extreme; that all seemed to be interested in the road, and many were willing to increase the sub scriptions already made by them—some to the amount of double the sum subscribed. One gentleman to the amount of $2,000 above his first subscription, and another to the amount of 

SI,OOO, and others in pro portion ; that his reception everywhere hud been kind and encouraging, and witli ex pressions of good will for the enterprise lie was engaged in. On motion, the meeting then adjourned, subject to the call of the Chairman, as pro vided in the resolutions offered by the Ex ecutive Committee. JAS. KEAN, Chairman. Geo. Y.
