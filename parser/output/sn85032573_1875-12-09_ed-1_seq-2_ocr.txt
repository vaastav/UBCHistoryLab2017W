MUUEOCK, Cditor. .VI CI1ITA. THUKSD .VY. DEC. 0, 1875. That Third Term Business. In an editorial, a few days wnci-, the Common wealth deprecated the "third term" talk, taking grounds t-quiuely against the nolicy its plausibility or .possibility. The Lawrence Standard, the next day commends the m.tiily po sition of the State paper, declaring that no other Republican paper of the State h-icl been so outspoken. Follow ing the latter tlio,iVtc1iioii Chnmpim makes quotations and asserts that, uol only a largo number of the State in Republican Conventions .leseinblcd, bad declared against a "third term," but that the Republican parly of Kuii sas had formally done the same thing, which action had been most .heartily and uuaiilmnurly upheld and endorsed by the Republican papers of Kansas. Wc have mislaid the articles alluded to and cannot, therefore, quote the words, but the Champion U right. The question arises in our mind why, at this time, the Co.wii'inwealth's article? The ' third term" business was an invention of the New York Democracy in the first place. Asa proposition to startle, as an assertion that Irom its nature was. hard to put down or deny, it proved nn effective weapon against our part for many months. As a party, we knew that such a political programme wa never dreamed of, nor did we believe that our patriotic I'rcsideul e, er contem plated buch ti step, nevertheless, the Democracy kept asserting, and the Republicans, in convention, denjing. until the "third term' scare had lost all its force. II the Commonwealth will permit us we will venture a statement of the reason for such an article at this time, nud it is this : Notwithstanding its Democraticauthorship and its continu al spurning by the President and the Republican party and its organs, the "third term" idea is rapidly gaining ground throughout the entire Nation ! And this "third term" sentiment is not traceable to Fedeial ofliseholduieith er, for the chances of a Republican success ,with .ucli a foneeded load arctoodespernto'for them to risk its juWoCuc'y, but it comes from a convic tionbased upon a thousand circum stances and overt acts that Hie country, its institutions and lately gained liberties would be safer in tried hands! What answer? Opening of tho XLIVth Concrees. The opening of the Fort -Fourth Congress at Monday noon, was marked with the largest crowd that ever be fore gathered at the capital of our country upon a like occasion. The House was called to order b Mcl'herson, the clerk of the last House and the hall was denied. Lamar moved that the House pro ceed to the election of Speaker. Agreed to. Lamar put in nomination for the of fice of Speaker of the House of Repre sentatives of the Forlx-lourth Con gress, Michael C. Kerr, member elect from the State of Indiana. Wheeler, of New York, nominated for the same position Ja?. G. Blainc,of the State of Maine. The clerk asked whether there wcic any other nominations, and there being no response he appointed as telleis llolman, Clyuicr, Danforth and Banks- The House then voted with the fol lowing result : Whole number of votes cist. 280; necessary to a choice, 141 Michael C. Kerr received 173 voles; J. G. Blaine received OC; A. S. Williams, of Michi gan, 1; Win. Anderson, of Illinois, 1. The clerk appointed Randall and Blaine to escort the Speaker elect to the chair. AsMr. Kerr wa conducted down tin main aisle to the Speaker's chair then was considerable clapping of hand on the Democratic side of the lIotii. which was stilled as Mr. Kerr began a short speech, promising complete fairness and impartiality to all. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, the oldest member of the Houe in continuous scrvice, adiniiiisteied the oath of office to the Speaker. The oath was then administered by the Speaker to mem bers, beginning with tlio-e from the New England States. What is known as the iron-clad oath was formerly ad ministered to members generally, but some of the Southern members being unable to take that oath, the modified oath was adminiterrd to them. The Senate whs promptly called to order at 12 m., by tho Hon. T. W. Fer ry, of Michigan, President pro icm. Tho Rev. T. D. Sundci land, chaplain offered prayer, in which lie invited the Divine blcsing on the President of the United States, Congress, and upon the whole Nation, and referred to deaths occurring since the lat session. Mr. Cooper, of Tennessee, presented ,,lheercdcntiaU of David M. Key, ap- k poijitwtl.Uuitcd States'Benator in place ,'effAmlrew Johuscu, deceased, and tic r waswarrf,iii. " " 'fite'tnftfal resolutions to notify the House and the President that a quorum of the Senate had assembled and was ready for bu-iu'ess, were adopted, and at 12 m. took a recess for a half hour. On reassembling, Mr. Boutwcll an nounced the death of Vice President Wilson, and said that at an early day resolutions relating to his life, charac ter aud public services would, be of- ed. ' '-'' Mr. Anthony said it wasnotCp'roba blc that any message would Wrcceived from tho House to-day, or, if at all. it would bcat-'a-very late hour. He, thcreTofeTttoiigbt, that the Senate JiiighlasiftweiL(ljourn. He made a WrOtioHje that effect, which was agreed tcVMdtat!T:4S the Senate aujourned till to-morrow. The President's Message. The President's message was not de livered until Tuesday noon, so we learn by a private telegram from Topcfca. It is a very lengthy State paper, contain ing nearly 18,000 words, and covers al most two pages of matter. By bidd ing back the Kaolr two or three hours aud keeping our force up all night, we ore enabled to present it toourrcadcrs in tho form of a supplement. The Champion Thief. The papers of yesterday contain the not unlookcd for announcement that Boss Tweed had escaped from custody and Is now at large. Tho old sinner begged to be allowed to visit his wife's room alone. The policeman having him in charge, thinking he was too long about it, attempted, to find him, whnn. Iiolinlillip. had flown. A nrettv ,, ..v.., Vw..v., - - . commentary upon redeemed New VcJrjc. , ( Tlsat Apportionment Again. Two weeks since we wrote a short artirle on the State apportionment to be made this winter. The. whv we said anything, probably, wa. treatise, the question was receiving considera ble attention at the hands of the edit ors throughout the State. What we said was that newspaper articles amounted to cry little, and that "af "ter thi winter it will bo tho fault of "the people of the interior if all the "offices nro ;:iveii to a few tovn, if all "the -latroungo is bestowed on men "and places representing only a frac linii of the population and wealth of "State; the fault of the rural districts "if each and every section the west "and south as well as the cast are not "honorably and fairly represented and "carod for politically, commercially "aud materially for all future time." Of the effect of this squib we allude in an article under editorial notes on the first page. Since writing that the Topeka Commonwealth comes to hand containing not only our article in full but the following sharp reply made by that able, and ordinarily fair, journal the Atchison Champion, which sa s : "Our friend Murdoch docs avixy unjust and mischievous thing in thus attcnipliuir to create a prejudice be tween different portion of ho State, and wo regret very much to see this lame spirit exhibited in papers in Western d Southwestern Kansas. It is not true that any injustice has been done Southern or Western Kansas in the apportiomcut If counties in that region have a smaller leprcscntation now than their population entitle them to, it is due to theirrapid growth and not to anything for Which the Leg islature is responsible. Apportion ment, are based on population returns, as friend Murdock well knows-, ami wo believe that the present apportionment of tho was, if not entirely, very neail his own work, while a member of the State Senate. Of course E.i-icrn Kansas had for a long time, a majority of the Legisla ture because it had" nearly all of the population. As settlement extended westward this difference in population decreased, aud has now :diuost entirely disappeared The representation ol the west has increased with each suc ceeding apportionment, and as the number ol Representatives aud Sena tors was limited the representation ol the east has decreased. We outgrow the apportionment in Kansas as rapid ly as a boy does a suit of clothes; and this growth is. very naturally, more marked in the western than the eastern counties, because there is more room for growth in the west. In one respect, however, Eastern Kansas voluntarily gac the new and sparsel settled counties the advantage in appoitioiiiueuls. The constitution, ailopted when all ot what is now known as Western Kansas was unin habited, provides that each organized county should have at least one Rep resentative. The con-equeiice of 'his provision i, that while one Represent ative in many ol the eastern counties represents ti oin six to eight thousand people, in many of the western coun ties the Representatives represent not more than from four hundred to a tliousaud people. But outside of all these thing', Kan sas is Kansas, and whatever benefits one section of the State benefits all other sections. We arc just as proud of the rapid growth and splendid de velopment of the Arkansas Valley as our friend Murdock can possibly be. and uc believe that we can say with perfect truth, that the Champion, here uti the eastern border of the Slate, has published as much concerning Western Kausns, has done as much to direct ini migratiou thither, ami has always man ifested just as lively, active and help ful an interest in the growth, develop ment and prosperity ot that section of the State as has the'Wichita Eacli:. Eastern Kansas has never maiulc-t-cd any jealousy of Western Kansas. Tin! people of the eastern border and central counties feel that they aie identified with those of the west in interest and in sentiment, and thai wtiatever i elps one of them helps all of thuin. Even dollar added to the value of Sedgwick enmity helps to p-iv the expenses of the State government, aud takes something from theburdeu. of Atchison county, and vice versa. If this city had a hundred thousand inhabitants and a taxable valuation of a hundred million dolla-s, would not every man in Sedgwick county be tieuelited llierenv ( In unci, we are all interested mutually in the prosperi ty, growth and development of even, piiitioii of the State, and there is no cause or rea-ou for jealousy or bicker ing between different localities. If the Eacilr means to provoke a sectional feeling that would lead to tho uouiiusiiiou aud elect ion of un worthy or inco.Mpotent men living in one section, or to thedcleat of worth and competent men bee me they hap pen to live in another, it is doing a very mischievous thing. Nobod) knows better than the editor of the Eaoi.i: that it would be prepoterous 1 absurd to preeut a man as a cindi diitc for auv position simply becau-e of his locally. If Sedgw.ck count can present the best man in the State tor Governor. orSenator, or Congress man, he ought to be elected; but it not, and she presents a candidate sim ply because he lives within her bor ders, he ought not to receive any con sideration whatever in any part o." the State. We do not mean to say, of course, that the best men lnvc ahvas been seicctcd in this State, because niieh an assertion would be notorious ly untrue. But we do mean to say that the mere fact that a man lives in SMiuthcrn, or Northern, or Eastern, or Western Kansas, should not entitle him to any support, nor should it pro voke opposition to him. T'-ie Eagi.h's article intimates that Western Kansas will soon be in a po sition to make war on Eastern Kansas people, and seems to advie and en courage vuch a war. Wo don't believe that friend Murdock means any such thing, and still less do wo believe that he could induce any general co-operation of the poople of Western Kansas in such a war, if he did. Wo f Ivan s;is arc one people, having common in lercst, common associations and sym pathies, and a common govcruuiciit. We shall prosper or fail together. And vc will continue, we hope, to appre ciate this fact, to act together, and help one another, knowing that whatever helps one sectiun helps all the rest". To all of the above wo briefly and succinctly answer: No attempt was made upon our part to stir up local strife, or to create a prejudice between different portions of Kansas. The animus of our article will admit of no such conclusion. Colonel Martin does us infinitely too much honor in speaking of the present apportionment. At that time wo rep resented a different portion ot the State entirely. Ho must have been thinking of tho Congressional appor tionment. We were a member of both committees, but to Sol. Miller, then Senator, tho rural districts owe, more than to any one else, what they did Set. That there is more room for im provement in the western than in the eastern counti.es we admit, in a material sense, but in political generosity aud fairness we can't see it. The history of the Republican party in Kansas docs violence to the presumption. That the constitution gives the new and sparsely settled counties an ad vantage in apportionments, is a spe cious humbug. Under this delightluli advantage we, two years ago, tried to t represent 60.OC0 people of a dozen ' counties in the State Senate. ThafEustcrii Kansas has never man ifested any jealously of Western Kan-- sas, is a proposition mat mignt no swallowed bv a man who never was a member of a Kansas Legislature, or a Kausag State Cotrvcntion and,- rrurid- iug, ho had uol read the article to which wc aVe replying. That the Eaqlk is provoking a sec tional feeling which would lead to the nomination and election of incompe tent men we think is true, in the esti mation of the Champion. Was not Colonel Martin a member of the last State Convention? Wo thou ask him where Prof. Norton is to-day? aud how felt the solid southwestern dele gation that asked his nomination after being snubbed by Eastern Kansas on another small office? In conclusion, for the sake of that harmony so largely dwelt upon by the Champion, and to make proper amends for wounded feelings and fears caused by our ill-advised words, wo will ac knowledge that Southwestern Kansas Congressmen or Governors; that it is has no men fit forUtiitcd States Senators presumption in us, because of our newness, to even ask a representation in tho Legislature, and. that rather than provoko the opposition and feel ing so soundly contemned, wo will agree to let Northeastern Kansas go on furnishing all the officers, only hop ing that our people will not bo denied tho humble privilege of voting for the able men whom Eastern Kansas, in her "common associations" and "sym pathies" may present for our suffrage and support. Tho Democratic Beacon. The Wichita Beacon, our cotempo rary, becomes a Democratic headlight, not only for Wichita but Southwest ern Kansas, wc judge. In its issue of yesterday morning i says, in conform ity with the original design it declares for Democratic principles. Well, we don't know any reason why it should not. One half of Congress the popu lar half over one half of the State Governors is of that stamp, and the impending great National light will be maintained on tho otic side by that party. If tho Deacon but maintains its present literary excellence ami local enterprise, it will not onlv hold tho same relation to the Democratic parly in Southwestern Kansas that the Ea gle has held to the Republican party, but will be recognized by the Demo cratic party of the State as a promi nent organ and valuable auxiliary. Regardless of the sigusof the times, and notwithstanding anydesigns upon the post office, we wish our neighbor continued prosperity. Tho Board of Directors of tho South western Kansas Fair Asso ciation. From R. L. West, tho Secretary of the above association wo learn that at the meeting of tho stated directors called for last Thursday, Win. Mat thewson, T. D. Fouls and R. L. West, of Sedgwick, Hon. II. C. St. Clair and Dr. A. K. Culbertson, of Sumner, and H. W. Beck, of Butler counties were present. After rcauiug and approving of the minutes of the last meeting, the com mittee, to whom was referred the work of drafting articles of incorporation, reported that they had duly obtained the charter under the laws from the Secretary of State. After reading some letters from Hon. II. A. Ensign, of Harvey county, Hon. II. C. St. Clair delivered a short address touching the benefits to be de rived from the organization to the counties interested, and Wichita ac the natural center for such a society aud its exhibitions. He was followed by Hon. John Kelly aud Col. T. D. Font', of this county, to the same end. Mr. II. W. Beck, o'f Butler, made a shirt speech in which he s'ated that Butler county would bo fully up with her large and growing interests. Upon motion an election of perma nent officers was proceeded with. Hon. II. C. St. Clair was unanimously cho sen as the Society's first President. Win. Grillenstein. of Sedgwick, Win. Harrison, of Butler, Mr. Humphreys, of Sumner, J. P. Cochran, of Cowley, T. W. Kellogg, of Harvey, Joshua Cowgcll, of Reno, were elected Vice Presidents: 11. L. Wc-t, Secretary, and Sol. II. Kolm, Treasurer. At the meeting of tho Society next day many matters of interest wcredis euscd, a large number of citizens and siockholdcis of the Sedgwick County Fair Grounds being present and taking an active pail. Among other plans, all of which appeared feasible, it was proposed to transfer the proper!, grounds and improvements of the county society to the district society, the latter proposing to add three thou sand dollars in improvements previous to the fair of 187G. Culbertson, Kolm; Matthewson, Balderstou, A. A. Moore, W. B. Smith and others endorsed the plan with much enthusiasm. Col. Fouts was appointed to revise the by-laws, when the association ad journed to meet Thursday, the Cthday of January, 187G, at Wichita. Tho Explanation. Besides, it js not long sinco wo saw in the Sun a good editorial advocating D. W. Wilder as a candidate for Gov ernor J Milton, my boy. which Gov ernor arc you for? Paoli Spirit. Both, by Susan ! The Sun has not yet said which particular, individual man it loves most for Governor. "It shines for all," you know! But then since the opportunity is presented it affords us great pleasure to say that we think "M. M. Murdock would make a good Governor." Marsh is voting. brim full of energy, and has plenty of talent. Uosi tiie potnvistor ot t'aoia lovo any one for Governor? Don't flirt, Perry! It's wicked. Parsons Sun. Immolated ! and by friends, too. Shame upon such trifling with the cherished aspirations ol one who nev er wished his brothers aught but good and that contiuuallv. "Grant is an awfully corrupt man," shouts the constitutional croaker. "Jewell is a Jewell of a Postmaster General," is the next utterance. "Bris tow is a host in the work of reform," occurs in tho next paragraph, and now "Old Z.ich Cliandler is purging the interior ol all the rascals." Yet this same Grant has called theso honest and cfllcicnt officers to his council, made them his confidential advisers, ami supports them in their work. The two stories don't agree at all, the logic is bad, and is not believed by those who make the charges against him. But this is Democratic logmand Demo cratic honesty both.

LETTER FROM WASHINGTON. The Kansas Delegation, RobelLoaf ora, and Things Generally. Washington, Dr.c. 3, 1875. iron. 21. 31. Murdock: Editou Eagi.e : In compliance with your request, I embrace this first op portunity of jotting down a few ob servations made- during my travels. 1 left home on the tenth ulttimo.arrivcd in Washington on the 15'h. Tho lGlh and 17th wa3 engaged in arguing con test land cases ucforc tho General Land flico. At that date but few members of Congress had arrived, but tho hotels were filled with Democratic office seekers. Candidates for ivery office, from chief clerk down to pages, were here, each anxious to present his claim first. On tho morning of the 17th Hon. John J. Ingalls, the United States Senator from Kansas, arrived here with his family. HiR residence is 939, "K" street. As an index of the stand ing of Senator lugalls in tho National capital, it is but necessary to state thai he had not been in the city more than half an hour before the news wa spread over the city and at tho De partments, that Senator Ingalls, from Kansas, had arrived. In him Kan-as has a representative possessing abilin aud influence. The Farmer-Granger Senator, James M. Harvey, has not yet arrived, at least I havo not heard of his arrival. Congressman, Win. A. PhiHips,froiu the first district, is hero. He and Sena tor Ingalls arc both busy looking aftei the interest of their constituents. Hon. John R. Goodin, fi'om tho sec ond district, has not yet arrived, he being detained in Ohio by the illnes of his mother and sister, who I learn are lying dangerously ill. His coming is anxiously looked for by the domi nant patty in the House, also by man aspirants for office, all of whom con cede that Mr. Goodin will be a leadei among them. Hon. W. R. Brown, who was elected by tho Republicans of the third dis irict to represent the people of said district, is in tho citv, at least, Alex. Banks says ho is here. Bythowa.v, that prince of good fellows, Alex. Banks, for years chief clerk of the Kansas House of Representatives, i now private secretary to Senator In galls and chief clerk of the Committee on Pensions, of which tho Senator is chairman. On tho ISth I went on to Philadel phia. Remained there one week, ex amining the various Centennial build ings in course of erection. The Main Exhibition, Agricultural and Memori al halls are all approaching completion rapidly. They are magnificent build ings. The main hall covers 21.47 acres, the agricultural hall, 10.15 acres, the memorial buildiug,1.7o acres, machine ry hall 13.94 acres. Ton to fifteen large hotels have been erected near the grounds, containing from one hundred to fifteen hundred rooui3 each. Exten sive arrangements are being made all over the city for tho accommodation of the legions that are expected to be there during 1S76. Every man who owns a business house, hotel or dwell ing thinks he has a bonanza. After eating a sumptuous thanks giving dinner at thoGirard I took the train for New York and spent Friday and Saturday viewing the city, visit ing all the places of interest. At iia p. in. the body of Vice President Wil son arrived 'ahtl'was escorted through the city by the old Seventh and other New York regiments. The mililar display was grand in the extreme. On Sunday morning, the 23th, I, in com pany with Frank Shannon, formerly of Wichita, who is now residing in New York and engaged at tlicManhat tan gas works, while his estimable wile i3 keeping a first-class boarding house at 79. McDougal street. Went over to Brooklyn to hear Rev. Hour Ward Beecher vrcach. Alter the usu al prayer and singing he read for his text the eighth chapter of Romans, sixteenth ver-e, from which he preach ed an eloquent and powerful sermon. He is still alive, notwithstanding the efforts ofTiltou aud Mrs. Moultou to kill him. In the afternoon wc visited Coutr.il Park and took a stroll up 'Fifth Avenue, which it is said con tains a greater number of elegant resi dences than any other one street in the world. Chief among them is tho mar ble palace of A. T. Stewart, the mil lionaire. I returned to this city ycrterday to find the excitement a fever head. Th grcat fight is for the Speakership. The contest at present is between Randall, of Pennsylvania, and M. C. Kerr of Indiana. 1 think R.iudall is the com ing man. For the interest of the Re publican parly ho is undoubtedly the best take. Banks, of Mississippi, for Chief Clerk and Thompson, of Ohio, for Sergcant-at-Arin, will, in all prob ability, cirry off the bets. But of all the old fossils in tho world, tho old rebel hunkers who have been dead for tho last fifteen years, but who have been rcsuriccted since tho last fall elections and have come up here with the moss still growing on their backs, as seekers after office, beats thorn all. The lame, the blind, the spavined and tho string halt are all hero crving, "give, give! for I am tho best rebel of them all." They have been cursing tho Government ever since 185S, but now that they have a chance for a suck at tho public tit they arc furious, con stantly boasting of their chivalrous deeds during the rebellion and of how many d d niggers they have killed since. 1 inquired -of a prominent Dem ocrat, a former member of Congress, to-day as to how the fight was going. His reply was, "Colonel, I have partici pated in all the political contests in Washington for the last thirty years, but this is the meanest and most dis graceful one I have ever witnessed." It has narrowed down to a personal fight among the leading candidates. They are charging each other with be ing thieves, ring masters, robbers, murderers, gamblers, ete. You may look for an explosion in the caucus on Saturday. John Morrisey is here bet ting heavily on Randall, offeiing ten to two. Pools are constantly selling, with Randall first choice, Kerr second aud Cox third. Important changes havo just taken place in the Indian Department. Agent Gibson goes out and Cyrus Beetle, now chief clerk for Superin tendent Hoag, takes his place. Super intendent Ilnag also goes nut aud Dr. Nicholson, of Lawrence. Kansas, suc ceeds him. This is good news for the citizens of Southwestern Kansas. But as this letter is already too long I will stop. More anon. Truly yours, W. S- J. Fitzhugh, elected doorkeeper of tho House, held the samo position in the Confederate Coagressi Annual Report of the Postmaster General. Tho Postmaster General's aniiual.rc port shows the receipts to be $27,441, 360 and tho expenditures .$33,911,309. Tho receipts exceed those of 1874 by one and thirteen one hundredths per cent., and expenditures by four and sixty-two one hundredths per cent. The actual amount drawn from the treasury was 4,716.329, or$514,G0Gless than the previous year. The recorded complaints of missing numbers wcro 5,645, of which 2.G77 wore registered letters containing bonds, dralts, etc., amounting to $76, 216, while tho'uiiregistcied letters con tained valuable contents amounting to -S75.999. Of the former 1,083 were satisfacto rily accounted for, 911 actually lost and 083 remain under investigation. Arrests for violation of the postal laws numbered 307, the greater portion not being connected with tho postal service. There were 107 convictions and 107 awaiting trial. Tho report shows the operations of the various bureaus of the department concerning which much information ha already been published. The money order department, the annual transactions of which have reached about eighty millions, shows an apparent profit of $120,000, though it is really in arrears more than that, if the clerk hire and stationery required for tho business were charged directly lo its account. Tho increase of rates on small orders, made by authority of last Congress, will, it is believed, ena ble tho the bureau to hereafter pay its own expenses. Tho tact that but one American steamship line carries mails across the Atlantic ocean and none to South America is regarded humiliating to American pride. Mr. Jewell thinks that as a matter id national pride, as an aid to a levivalof American commerce, and as a moans of supplying an efficient steam marine, available tor immediate use by the Government in case of war, provision should bo madr for transportation of our mails, on the important ocean rotiii's, on steamers officered and manned by our own citizens, and sail ing under our own flag. A moderate compensation in excess if postage now allowed, would enable ihe establishment and mafiiicuaucc of American lines to Europe and South America, and a moderate mail com pensation for a lino to China and Jap an, will doubtless continue tho mail service to thoe countries in American -hips after the termination of tho ex isting subsidy contract, which will ex pire on the 31st of December, 187G. The fast mail service i praised, and ihe opinion is expressed, that at no distant day the business of the depart ment will bo so great as to induce rail road companies to run similar trains iioiu New England to Ihe Gulf, and horn the Atlantic to tho Pacific. It is recommended that ani person be permitted, without additional eliarge, to write a form of presentation in any book, pimphlct, or magazine. or auv other matter of the third class; .mil also that the sender of any pack age be permitted, without additional charge, to write his or her name and address on the outside thereof, with the word "from'" above or preceding the same, so as to inform the person addresed of the name of the sender, and to write briefly on any package the number and name of the articles en closed. As to transient printed matter, the Postmaster General says: "I recom mend that the postage on transient newspapers and periodicals, books, printed matter of all sorts, lithograph ing and maps.shectniusic.photographs and manuscripts designed for publica tion shall be reduced to one cent for each two ounces or fraction thereof, which was the rate before the enact mniit .if the l-nr .idvnui'iiiif it during the closing hours of tho last session of Congress. Concerning newspaper postage, ho says: "The new law which went into effect on the first day of January, 1875, from present indications will realize about one million dollars for the first calendar year. This is not a material variation from the average results of the old law. though dining the last year in which this hitter wa. in operation the amount was increased by the payment of post age on newspapers circulating within the conutv of publication a require ment that "was discontinued at the end of one year. While there has been no increase in the aggregate receipts, ihero has been a largo net gain by saving tho commis sions, on collections allowed by the old law, as under tho present law ihcgre.it bulk of postage is paid at th" large of fices, where salaries aro not affected by this item. The new system has worked so ad mirably, and " lias given such general satisfaction that no change has been deemed necessary. It is recommended that the compen sation of postmasters of ihe fourth da's bo based upon the business ol i heir respective offices as determined by the cancellation of stamps, the amount being duly sworn to for each quarter and returned to the Sixth Au ditor. There is a great want of equity in the compensation of postmasters of the first, second and Ihiid classes; it sala ries of smaller offices aro not excessive those of larger cities are certainly too low. I find postmasters, as a class, to be efficient, capable ami attentive bevoud my expectations, and their salaries should be ptoportionatc to their du ties. In estimating the expected revenues for the year ending June 30ih; 1677, wishing "to be on the snfesideeti:3ates have been submitted which show an expected deficiency of $3,181,602, but it is believed the deficiency for that year will be very much less than the esti mates, basing tho estimates of the rev enues at thcsmallest amount aud of the expenditure! at the largest.
