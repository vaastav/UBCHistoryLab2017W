': lIKRKIMKH. N. T., Dec. The Jury In th.- trial of Chester. K. Gillette for the murder of his sweetheart, Grace Brown; at.

When Marshal Heath, the foreman, declared that a verdict of guilty In the first flejrrr- 0 liail been found the pris oner gave no sign of emotion. He was taken back to his cell. One juror held "tit for acquittal until thr sixth ballot. Ollletto sat motionless In his chair as the Jury was polled and when the twelfth man had responded the stolid indifference or studied composure of the boy was exhibited as never before. Leaning over a nearby table he drew toward him a hit of white paper and taking a pencil from his pocket wrote this message: "Father: I am convicted. — Chester." This was one of the earliest dis patches carrying thp news of Gillette's doom beyond the walls of the court house. It went to his father in Denver. Prosecutor Grills Defendant Pistrirt Attorney Ward early today resumed his summing up of the case Against Chester E. Gillette, charged with the murder of Grace Brown. He described Gillette's life in Cortland as outwardly correct, but actually lust ful, as shown by the wrong he admit ted he had done Grace Brown. "Gillette." Ward said, "wanted to stay In Cortland society. He never intend ed, never for a moment, to take Grace Brown anywhere except to her death. He concocted a plan to rid himself of her. The girl received her death blow, I am sure, with a grateful heart out there in the woods." Mr. Ward described Gillette as an unmitigated coward. "The cool, clever, courageous scoun drel," the prosecutor declared, "said upon the stand thnt he asked Grace Brown to go with him on Decoration day. A man can be drilled into a long Btory to cover guilt, but the lie will come out." Calls Him a Rat The prosecutor's address was intense with feeling. As he read the letters of Grace Brown and pointed out the sentiments that she expressed, saying that the writer was a girl of pure thoughts and in the same breath re ferred to the defendant as a rat, Gillette broke Into tears and It was some time before he was able to regain his com posure. The district attorney concluded his address at 4:15 this afternoon, when Judge Devendorff began his charge to the Jury. Judge Devendorff completed hia charge and the Jury filed into its room at 5:50 p. m.
