THE SEMI-WEEKLY HIRER. BUTTE. MONTANA, DEC. 8. 188«. PRESUBTTS MESSAGE. devoid of merit, bat eo surrounded by sen timent and patriotic feeling that they are hard to remet. I suppose it will not be denied that many claims for pensions are made without merit, and many have been allowed on fraudulent represetations. This has been declared from the-Pension Bureau, not only in this bat in prior administrations. Estimates from the best information obtained, are that about 9,000 of those who have served in the army and navy of the United States are now supported, in whole or in port, from public funds or by organised charities, exclusive of those in Soldiers' Homes under the direction or controfof jtbe government. Only 13 per cent, of these are pensioners, while of the entire number of men furnished for the late war something like 20 per cent., including their widows and relatives, have been or ore now in the receipt of pensions. The American people, with a patriotic and grateful reward for our ex-soldiers, too broad and too sacred to be monopolised by any special advocates, are not only willing, but anxious, that equal and exact justice should be done to honest claimants for pensions. In their sight the friendless and destitute soldier, dependent on public charity, if not otherwise entitled, has pre cisely the same right to share the provision made for those who fought their country's battle as those better able, through friends and influence, to push their claims. Every pension that is granted under our present plan upon any other grounds than actual service, injury, or disease incurred in such service, and every instance of the many in which' pensions are increased on other grounds than the merits of the claim work an injustice to the bra veand crippled but poor and friendless soldier, who is en tirely neglected, or who must be content with the smallest sum allowed under gene ral laws. There are far too many neigh borhoods in which are found glaring cases of inequality of treatment in the matter oi pensions, and they are largely due to a yielding in the Pension Bureau to impart unity on the part of those other than the pensioners who are especially interested, or they arise from special acts passed for the benefit of individuals. The men who fought side by side should stand side by side when they participate in a grateful nation's kind re membrance. Every consideration of fairness and jus tice to our ex-soldiers and the protection of the patriotic instincts of our citizens from perversion and violence point to the adoption of a pension system, broad and . comprehensive enough to cover every con tingency, and which shall make unnecessary and objectionable a volume ofspecial legisla tion. As long as we adhere to the principle of granting pensions for service and disabil ity as the result of the service, the allow ante of pensions should be restricted to cases presenting these features. Every patriotic heart responds to a tender con sidération for those who, having served their country, long and well, are reduced to destitution and dependence, not as an incident of their service, but with advanc ing age or through sickness or misfortune. We are all tempted by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief, and are often impatient of the limitations of public duty. Yielding to no one in the desire to indulge this feel ing of consideration I cannot rid myself of the conviction that if these ex soldiers are to be relieved the v and their cause are entitled to the benefit of an en actment under which relief may be claimed as a right, and that such relief should be granted under the sanction of law, not in evasion of it; nor should such worthy ob jects of care, all equally entitled, be remit' ted to the unequal operation of the sym pathy or tender mercies of social and po litical influence, with their unjust discrimi nation. The discharged soldiers and sailors of the country are our fellow citizens and are in terested with us in the passage and faith ful execution of a wholesome las. They cannot be severed from their duty of citi zenship by artful appeal to their spirit of brotherhood born of common peril and suffering, nor will they act as a test of de votion to their peril and suffering, nor will they act as a test of devotion to the wel fare or willingness to neglect public duty in their behalf. 

PATENT OFFICE. On the fourth of March, 1885, the cur rent business of the Patent Office was on an average five months and a half behind, and at the close of the last fiscal year such current work was but three months in ar rears, and it is asserted and believed that in the next few months the delay in obtain ing an examination of an application for a patent will be but nominal. The number of applications for patents during the last fiscal year including re-issues, designs,trade marks and labels equals 40,678, which is considerably in excess of the number re ceived during the preceding^year. There ceipts of the patent office during the year aggregates $1,250,167.30, enabling the of fice to turn into the Treasury over and about all expenditures about $163,701. The report of the Commissioner shows the office to be in a prosperous condition and constantly increasing in its business. No increase in force is ssked for. The amount estimated for the year ending June 30. 1887, was $853,969. The amount esti mated for the fiscal year ending June 30 1888, is $778,770. PACIFIC SUBSIDIZED ROADS. The Secretary of the Interior suggests a change in the plan for the payment of the indebtedness of the Pacific su bsidized roads to the government. In considering the plan proposed the sole matters which should be taken into account, in my opin ion, are the situation of the government as a creditor, and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of the debt. By a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States it has been adjudged that the laws of the several States are inoperative to regulate the rates of transportation upon railroads, if such regulations interfere with the rate of car riage from one State into another. This important field of control and regulation having been thus left entirely unoccupied, the expediency of federal action upon the subject is worthy of consideration. The relations of labor to capital and of LABORING MEN TO THEIR EMPLOYERS are of the utmost concern to every pa triotic citizen. When these h re strained and distorted unjustifiable claims are apt to be insisted upon by both interests, and in the controversy which results, the wel fare of all and the prosperity of thecountry are jeopardized. Any intervention of the general government within the limits of its constitutional authority to avert such a condition should be willingly accorded. In a special message transmitted to Congress at its last session, I suggested the enlarge ment of our present labor bureau and adding to its present functions the power of arbitration in cases where differences arise between employes and employers. Wbsn these differences reach such a stage as to result in the interruption of com merce between states and the applica tion of this remedy by the general govern ment might be regarded as entirely within its constitutional powers, and I think we might reasonably hope that such arbitra tion, if carefully sdected, and if entitled to the confidence of the parties to be effected, would be voluntarily called to the settle ment of controversy of less extent and not necessarily without the domain of fedeial regulation. I am of opinion that this sug gestion is worthy of the attention of Con gress. But after all has been done by the passage of laws either federal or state to relieve a situation full of solicitude, much more remains to be accomplished by the re-instatement and cultivation of a true sentiment which recognizes the stability of American citizenship. This in the light of our traditions, and in loyalty to the spirit of our institutions would teach that a hearty co-operation on the part of all in terests is the surest path to national' greatness and the happiness of all our peo ple, that capital Bhould, in recognition of the brotherhood of our citizenship, and in a spirit of American fairness generally, gen erously accorded t o labor, iB a just com pensation and consideration, and that contented labor is capital's best protection and faithful ally. It would teach, too, that the diverse situations of our people are in separable from our civilization; that every citizen should, in bis sphere, be a contribu tor to the general good that capital does not necessarily bend to the oppression of labor, and that violent disturbances and disorders alienate from the promoters of true American sympathy and kindly feeling. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, representing the oldest and largest of ogr national industries, is subserving well the purposes of its organization. By the in froducttOB of new subject« of farming en are on of in by in or or on oi of of re to of be in of is ■ proepçrrey. xnrougn in is Med through an investigation subjects it bas is chars*, g other things, be practically teeprise aad by opeslng as» sources of ag ricultural wealth sad the dissemination of early informatioa roaerraing production and priées, it has contributed largely to the country's p rosperity. Through this agency, advanced..... touching the should, among other applied to the home production, at a low cost, of articles of food which ate now im ported from abroad. 8aeh an inno vation will necessarily, of coarse, the beginning . be within the do main of intelligent expérimente, and the subject in every stage should receive nil possible encouragement from the govern ment. The interests of millions o(our citi zens engaged in agriculture are involved in an enlargement and improvement of the results of their labors, and a zealous regard for their welfare should lie a willing tribute to those whose production are the main source of onr progress and power. Hie existence of PLECBO-FNEUMON1A among the cattle of the varions States has led to burdensome and insomr cases disas trous restrictions in an important branch of onr commerce, threatening to effect the quantity and quality of oar food supply. This is a matter of such importance and such far-reaching consequences that I hope it will engage the serions attention of Con gress, to the end that each a remedy may be applied as the limits of a constitutional delegation of power to the general govern ment will permit. I commend to the con sideration of Congress the report of the Commission« and his suggestions concern ing the interest entrusted to hie care. CIVIL SERVICE. The continued operation of the law re lating to our civil service has added to the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of note that every public officer who has a just idea of his duty to the people testifies to the value of this reform. Its staunchest friends are found among those who understood it best and its warmest supporters are those who are constrained and protected by its re quirements. When the civil service yields more ftiUy to an examination the system will then have large additions to the num ber of its biends. Now onr civil service reform may be imperfect in some of its de tails and it may be misunderstood and opposed; it may not always be faithfnlly applied; and its designs may sometimes miscarry, through mistake; it may some times tremble under the assaults of its enemies or languish und« the misguided seal of impracticable fri* nds and fail. 'We people of this country never submit to the banishment of its underlying principle bom the operation of tbeir government. They will not abandon the sorest guaran tee of the safety and success of American institutions. I invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of the Congress. I renew my recommendation made last year that commissioners be made equal to oth« offices of the government having like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable appropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the usefulness of the cause they have charge of. freedmen's bank. I desire to call the attention of Congress to a plain duty which tbe government owes to the depositors of the Freedmen Savings and Trost Company. This company was chartered by Congress tor the benefit of the most illiterate and humble class of people, with the intention of encouraging them to industry and thrift.Mostof the branches were presided over by officers holding tbe commission and clothed in the uniform of the United States. These and other cir cumstances reasonably, I think, led these simple people to suppose that the invita tion to deposit their bard-earned savings in this institution implied an undertaking on the part of the government that their mouey should be safely kept for them When this company failed it was liable in the sum of $2,939.925.22 and had 131 de positors. Dividends amounting in the ag gregate to 60 per cent bave been declared and the'sum called for and paid of such dividends seem lo be $1,648,181.72. This sum deducted from the entire list of de posits leaves $129,144.50 still unpaid. Past experience has show that quite a large part of this sum will not be called for. There are assets still on hand amounting to tbe estimated sum of $16,000. I think the remaining 38 p« cent, of each of these deposits as have claimants should be paid by the government upon principles of equity and fairness. The report of tbe Commissioner, soon to be laid before Con gress will give more satisfactory details on this subject. 

DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA. The control of the affairs of the District of Columbia having been placed in the hands of purely executive officers while the Congress still retains all' legislative author ity relating to its govern meut, it becomes my duty t-o make known the most pressing needs of the District and recommend their consideration. The laws of tbe District appear to be in an uncertain and unsatis factory condition, and their codification or revision is much needed. During the past year one oi the bridges leading from the District to the State of Virginia became unfit for use and travel npon it was for bidden. This leads me to suggest that the improvement of all the bridges crossing the Potomac and its branches from the City of Washington is worthy the attention of Congress. The commissioners of the District repre sent that the laws regulating the sale of liquors and granting license therefor should be at once Amended, and that legislation be made to consolidate, define and enlarge the scope and power of charitable and penal institutions within the District. I suggest that the commissioner be clothed with the power to make, within fixed limitations, police regulations. I believe this power granted and carefully guarded would tend to subserve the good order of the municipality. It seems that trouble exists growing out of the occupations of the streets and avenues by certain rail roads having their terminus in the city. It is very important that snch laws be enac ted upon this subject as will secure to tbe railroads all the facilities they require for the transaction of their business and at the same time protect citizens from injury to their persons or property. Hie com missioners again complain that the acom modations afforded them for the necessary office for district business and for the safe keeping of valuable books and papers are entirely inefficient. I recommend this con dition of affairs to be remedied by the Congress, and that suitable quarters be furnished for the district government. In conclusion I earnestly invoke snch wise action on the part of the people's legislators as will subserve the public good and dem onstrate during the remaining days of this Congress as at present organized Its ability and inclination to so meet the people's needs that it shall begratefully remembered by an expectant constituency. Grover Cleveland. Washington, December 6,1886. 

ARRIVAL OF PRESIDENT DANA. The Montana Union and Its Excellent Management. President N. J. T. Dana, of tbe Montana Union, accompanied by his wife, arrived in this city yesterday morning. Mr. Dana will remain in Butte for some time, to look after the interests of the Montana Union. He expects to make a visit over the line in a few days, in company with Manager Blackwell. YVhat changes »ill be made in tbe management of the road he was una ble to state. Manager Blackwell, who has so ably conducted the affaira of the com pany in the past, desires to be relieved, so as to enable him to return to Omaha, where his family now resides. It was un derstood at the time of his accepting the position of Manager of tbe Montana Union, that it should only be temporary. Who his successor will be has not yet been made known, Rumor has it that the position will be tendered to agent Dawson, who is now tbe joint agent of all the lines which center in South Butte. No better selection could be made, for Mr. Dawson has been a Division Superintendent on the Grand Trunk Railroad for a great many yearn prior to hia arrival here, and is thoroughly competent to fill the position.

Lippin cott met with a very painful accident yes terday about noon. The Judge and sever al oth« gentlemen were taking a drive ont to Brown's Gulch, and when opposite the Pavilion, on West Granite street, the driv«'e whip sccidentty dropped out of tbe carriage. Mr. Lippincott volunteered a* once to go back and get it. Mr. Peterson who was driving, stopped the team to let him oat. Mr. Lippincott pat one loot on the brake block and was in tbe net of jump ing oat when his right foot slipped, landing him on the ground with the whole weight of his body on the right leg, breaking it in two pinces below tbs knee. Kind hands at once carried him into Dr. Johnston's office, which was dose by. The doctor set snd and dreseed the broken limb. Mr. DeWittt noon after notified Mm. Lip pincott of tiie accident-, who asked him "Have you told me tha worst?" When so assured she at once set to work to prepare for hie comfort. ms arrival at home. The party soon arrived with the suffer«, who was carefully laid on the bed which bod been prepared for him Dr. Johnston was seen last evening at Mr. Lippincott 's residence, where he went to look after bis patient's welfare for the night. He stated to a Miner reporterthat one of tbe fractures had taken place right above the ankle and the oth« break was fonr or five inches higher up. The outer ligaments had all been tom from the flesh, while the ankle had also been dislocated making it a very painful limb for the J udge for some time to come. As soon os it was reported in the city yesterday that Jndge Lippincott had broken his leg. kind friends at once flocked to his horns to offer and render any assist ance that lay in the ! ' <ow ef. At a late hoar last evening Mr. ^..ppincott was rest ing as comfortably as could be expected, and bears op bravely und« bis severe af fliction. That he may speedily recover is the wish of tbe Judge's host of friends in the city and vicinity. SECOND-CLASS DINING CARS. The Put Union Pacific Will Soon Them on its Lines. It has been rumored for some time past that the Union Pacific railroad contem plated patting on its main line second-class dining cars between Omaha and Ogden which it intends to run in connection with its second-class sleepers. It is generally un derstood that the Central Pacific will fol low as soon as the Union Pacific inaugur ates the new schedule. Tbe new dining cars of the Union Pacific have just been turned out of the Bhop at Omaha, and are neat in appearance, being built after the pattern of the dining room cam now in use on all tbe eastern roads, they look more like first-class diners than second. Tbe price of a meal on these cam has been placed at the mod«ate sum of fifty cents, thus enabling all to partake of a square meal in a dining room car when traveling. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE; In this issue The Miner presents the con eluding portions of President Cleveland'i second annual message. The paper is very lengthy one, bnt this great country has grown to such magnificent proportions and contains such a vast aggrega' ion of interests as important as they are diversi tied that - large space is required to present them all intelligently to Congress with the suggestions which naturally occur from close and careful study of the nature and scope of each. The message is a very able one and evidences in a pronounced degree the thoroughness of research, the breadth of view, the thought and admir able arrangement of topics which charac terize the state papers of the executive, The President's views upon the several subjects considered are eminently sound and conservative, and his suggestions practical and to the point. He shows, with a clearness which cannot be misunderstood, the necessity for a reduc tion of the present tariff taxation, and un less it be the desire of Congress to accumu late a vast surplus in the Treasury, that body will immediately shape legislation in accordance with the President's sugges tions. Ail the public debt which can be called in and paid for many years will fall due within twelve months and be paid. His remarks concerning civil service re form, the pension laws, the repeal of some of the land laws, the relation of capital and labor, etc-, will meet the views and receive tbe endorsement of every man who has given them due thought. Onr relations with foreign Powers are at present satisfactory, but the President di recta the attention of Congress to the necessity of this government of ar riving at a definite understanding with Mexico concerning the status of American citizens within the borders of that Republic, The Cutting cuse is referred to and conclu sions drawn therefrom, which plainly in dicate that the President does not approve of the action of the Mexican government in the premises. Contrary to the expectations of many Mr. Cleveland does not refer to the silver question. He evidently belives tbe people are decidedly in favor of the coinage of the metal and would disapprove of Congres sional action which would impair the integ rity of silver or circumscribe its circula tion in trade channels. Hence he refrains from suggesting a coarse of action upon the part of Congresss in regard to silver coinage which would pro voke hostile legislation. Mr. Cleveland evidently comprehends the fact that he is tbe servart of the people—not their lord and master—and will subject his views to the will of his constituency. The coinage of silver will not be interrupted by this Congress. Taken altogether the message is tbe best state paper that bas been issued from the executive department of the government for many years. The questions are fairly stated, their discussion candid and the con elusions logically drawn and are irre sistible . The most radical Republican in the country cannot reasonably antagonize them. The message is replete with matter for favorable criticism. John Sherman's friends are saying that Ohio will be solid for him at the Republi can National Convention year after next. Well, Ohio was solid for John in 1880, bather delegation never did an honest hour's work for him from the time it reached Chicago until Garfield was nomi nàted. If Sherman wants a delegation that will stand by him he must get himself put at the head of it. Ohio Republican politi cians will swap him again for the first available man if he don't. The Pioneer Press, inmentioning the per sonal friends of the late ex-President Ar thur have already contributed about $50, 000 towards the erection of a $100,000 monument to his memory, and that they are determined no appeal shall be made to the public in this behalf, very sensibly adds: This is eminently proper. The money will be much sooner forthcoming in the way they have elected. Recent experience in monument fund* in this country, depend ent upon public enthusiasm, has been rather unfortunate. 

SECRETARY LAMAR'S REPORT. It seems the Secretary of the Interior has met with several surprise« since he as sumed control of that department. Among them is one of the legacies of the late Re publican administrations left to President Cleveland iii the shape o! shiftless, careless surveys of the public domain. These "go as-you-please'' surveys of the agricultural lauds in this Territory have been and are still » great «tumbling block in tbe way of homes in the Territory. A stoke ar mound of section cornera ore os hoed to find os Os govern meat surveyors who van the lines on plats in their offices. A noth« surprise which excited the indig nation of the Secretary was the large areas of the public lands that were fenced in by tbe ca ttl e m en of Wyoming and New Mex ico. He cannot comprehend tbe eabHme audacity of the "cattle growers" of those terri to ri «, who not only appropriate what rightfully belong* to the government, bnt unblushingly contend that their rights nie invaded when commanded to move tbeir mÜMof barbed wire feme« from the na tional domain. Hie determination, how ever, to give every stock grow« a chan« at the water conn« of the great rangea tbe country will be commended by every fur-minded man. The Secretary is emi nently level-headed in his recommendation that the right of way to build a railroad through tbe National Park be denied by Congress. THE 

DIFFERENCE. Some of our Republican contemporaries still frei very sore over the removal of Stone and the reinstatement of Benton by President Cleveland, and vent tbeir ill humor on every possible occasion. Now tbe difference between those two men is this: Benton made speeches defending the administration and urging people to sup port it while Stone attacked it and held it up to ridicule. As the burden of tbe charge against Stone is that there was something peculiarly vicious in his attacks upon an administration whose creature and servant he was, it follows, logically enough, that whether he held his tongue or not he was not the best possible agent for a Demo cratic administration to entrust its affaire with. Silenced or speaking, Stone was an enemy of the existing ordre, and his private attacks upon it were probably more nu merous and effective than anything that be may have said upon the stump. The same thing is trne of all oth« Republicans who now hold positions of trust and re sponsibility under Mr. Cleveland. If they are honest men they do not approve of the present administration and they will not lose an opportunity to tell the world of it. If they are willing to shape their political opinions and utterances so as to please Mr. Cleveland they are abont the most hypo critical specimens of the spoilsman that can be found in the conntry. . A Chicago crank has got the end of all things comfortably fixed. He bolds that the world will last until 1900. We believe that it will, if not longer. An exchange says Susan B. Anthony, a short time ago, said that Abraham Lin coln was one man ehe could have loved The many friends and admirers of the dis tinguished statesman will now congratulate him for being dead. The Louisville Courier-Journal is respon sible for the following: "The Bible which Mr. Blaine is to kiss when he takes the oath as President of the United States, like the lost books of the Talmud which are only revealed once in a thousand years to saints in their dreams, will perhaps be shown to Mr. Blaine when he awakens in the world to come. Bnt not before." A wicked Republican contemporary sug gests that "Secretary Bayard should select a tank of sufficient capacity to represent this government at Mexico. So far he has flattered his men by giving them credit for being able to carry more than they were originally built for." How would some of the old whisky-riBgers who flourished like green bay trees under Grant's administra tion do ? Advertised Letter List.

Macallister, who last evening gave his first entertainment at the Grand Opera House. The featB per formed were not the stale repetition of worn-out tricks, but fresh and surprising exhibitions of all that is wonderfuly in the wizard way. His canary bird and Nep tune's vases performances were surprising and uncomprehensible to the aud : ence. and displayed almost supernatural powers. But the most pleasing part of the entertainment was exbibi te 1 in the distribution of pres ents. Mr. George Frank Marsh drew the $10 prize, and Mr. Charles Warren's little daughter was selected as the little girl to draw the ticket from tbe hat. Mr. George Frank Marsh, when receiving the $10 prize, told the professor to stop when he had counted out $5 and said to him, "The other $5 goes to tbe little girl." Tbe pro fessor will appear in an entire change of programme this evening. Ram at the Pavilion.

NEIGHBORING NOTES. Helena barbers are now shaving for 15 cents a shave. It makes one laugh to read the accounts of the capture of Corey as published in the Butte papers.—Dillon Examiner. In the next Territorial Council the one just elected will not number one amongst them, while in the Legislature there are four.

We have been informed that at the re cent visit of Gen. Pearson to Fort Belknap he was informed by the Aesinaboine and Gros Ventre Indians that they were anx iously awaiting the arrival of the Indian commission, and expressed a willingness to surrender their rights to the country if the government will set apart a tract of land for them back of Broadwater's Landing, near the head of People's Creek. They ear nestly desire the railroad to be constructed through the reservation.—River Press. It is reported in Bismarck that a fight took place between a band of Crow Indians and some Canadian trappers on the Mis souri River in Montana. It is said that the Indians caught the trappers stealing game from their traps and a vigorous fight en sued. The trappers numbered five armed with Winchester rifles and ten with shot guns. One trapper was killed but the In dians were driven back and pursued reven miles, "Corey is one of the men who was mixed up in the bogus gold-brick game by which Colonel Jenks was swindled out of some $1.500 some mouths ago, and was in jail awaiting trial at the time of his escape. He has the reputation of being a desperate man, and his action at the time of his ar rest evidently carries out the assertion." Tbe above is the account as it appeared in the Examiner. Neighbor, you should post yoursrif on the subject. Corev is not one of the gold-brick swindlers who fleeced Col. Jenks several months ago, but at the time of his escape was confined in the county jail for pawning a bogus brick on Mrs. Abraham's on East Park street, for $5.

An Interesting; Dosassent Fro« tits In terior Deportment. Washington, December 5.—The report of the Secretary of the Interior which is made public to-night is an instructive revis« of the work of tbe Interior Department for the *ee*i year ended last June. Concern ing INDIAN AFFAIBS Mr. Lamar says: "During tbe year there has been practically no actual disturbance or serions alarm caused by any of them, exrept the Chiricahua Apaches. It is high ly gratifying to report that oat of an In dian population, estimated at 260,000 less than 100 have been engaged in opeD opposition and resistance to the authority and control of the government. There has been steady though not rapid improvement in the moral, material and intellectual con dition of the mass of the Indian popula tion daring the past- twelve months. The report urges Congress to pass the bill "to provide tor the appointment of a commiseioner to inspect and report on the condition of Indians, Indian affairs and for other pu pores," and also calls the at tention of Congress to tbe need of indus trial Indian schools at Salem, Or., and the Carlisle school, for the proper training oi Indian pupils in agricultuaral industries. CONCERNING CALIFORNIA The Secretary says: A Senate bill was pending in Congress at its last session, pro viding for a commission to make jnst and satisfactory settlement with the Mission Indians, residing in the State of California, upon reservations to be secured to them as their own property. It passed tbe Sen ate, but did not become a law. The pas sage of this bill, or what I think is better, the incorporation of its provisions into a bill creating a general commission on In dian matters, is important. So serious have become embarrassments to there In dians by ENCROACHMENTS BY WHITE 8ETTLEBS upon their lands, that tbe Inspector who rerently inspected tbe affairs of that agency strongly urged the use of military for« to clear the reservations at once of all white persons claiming lands within tbeir limits. Tbe bill prepared in this de partment and presented to Congress at its last session, providing for tbe allotment of lands to Indians on Round Valley reserva tion in California, extinguishing of claims of settlers, and for the sale of any surplus lands, passed the Senate, but failed to be come a law. This reservation embraces an area ol 102,118 acres. Tbe Commissioner reports that ranchmen and others claim ing title to ODly about 1,080 acres within ils limits, are occupying nine-tenths of the res«vation. TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT of tbe Indians therein. I concur with him that if the bill referred to or some other, measure for the protection of the interests of these Indians does not soon become a law it will eventually become necessary to abandon the leservation and turn*the Indians loose on the surrounding country. This is one of the difficulties of Indian matters that should be more intelligently presented for-the action of the executive and to Congress by the commission here tofore recommended. The Indians are well prepared to take land in severalty and Congress is urged to graDt legislative authority therefor." On the subject of PUBLIC LANDS the report says: The commissioner's re port upon public surveys, though interest ing, is a painful exhibit. It appears from this document that available agricultural land in most of the public land States and Territories has been largely returned as surveyed and surveys paid for by the United States, but in many instances the reported suiveys are so defective and erro neous as to be without merit and mislead ing and that in other rases no actual sur veys were made but plats were manufac tured upon the basis of FICTITIOUS FIELD NOTES. The proportion of unsurveyed lands is reported substantially as follows in the States and Territories named. In Arizona one-fifth; in California seven-sixteenths; in Colorado seven-eighths; in Dakota one half of the Territory; in Florida, five-sixths: in Idaho one-fifth; Minnesota four-fifths; Nevada one-half; Montana one-fourth; New Mexico, two-fifths; Oregon two-thirds; Washington, one-half; Wyo ming, three-fourths; California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and Wyo ming unsurveyed areas are generally moun tainous or heavily timbtred. In Florida the unsurveyed lauds are principally in the vicinity of everglades and on islands and keys on the coast. In Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Wyoming the country is reported to be largely occu pied by cattle ranches. In the present con dition of there surveys it - is very difficult for the government to prosecute successfully trespassers upon public lands and depre dators upon timber, and it is almost im possible for settlers to identify the lard they wish to enter. Examinations of de posit surveys in Washington, Oregon, Cali fornia, Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado, Utah aud Nebraska show them to be, in numer ous instances, unreliable, defective or ficti tious. The obvious deductions from the statements of this report, which, 60 far as I can judge, are based upon patient and the faithful study of the reports of subordinate agencies of the bureau are: First—There should be an inspection of all work returned as executed in the field preliminary to the official acceptance of the moneys and payment therefor. Second—That the present extension of the public surveys over new territory is not largely required in the interest of legiti mate settlement. Third—That, owing to extensive frauds committed in surveys under the deposit system, a re-survey of a considerable por tion of the several States and Territories is becoming a matter of urgent necessity. Fourth—The enactment of a law making false and fraudulent returns of public sur veys a penal offense, and providing also penalties for willful destruction or removal of surveying monuments. The report recommends the modification of the deeert land laws, so as to render them less liable to abuse or their repeal. The repeal of THE 

TIMBER CULURE ACT is also recommended. The Secretary says: The statement made in my last annual report that large bodies UNLAWFUL ENCLOSURES of land were unlawfully enclosed for pri vate purposes by individuals and corpora tions engaged in what they call "growing live stock and 'ranching" have been veri fied by the reports of special agents from that time until now as shown by the re port of the Commissioner of the (rpnprnl Land Office; 375 of the unlawful inclosures covering an area of nearly 6,410,000 acres have bren brought to his attention up to the present time. It is believed that this does not represent nearly all the area ille gally inclosed. Proceedings to compel re ?K°nnkn aVe bee ?, brou « hfc - involving 2, 250,000 acres. Cases embracing 3,750, 000 acres are pending examination and from part of these the fences are now being removed. The total area from which fences have bren and are being removed,as shown oe ^ P011 0t T the , com mis«oner, is 2. 714,926 acre?. In order to obtain direct information on this subject I instructed two inspectors appointed under the act of i* ^eir special dfrectlt n d to report tothe department directly. One was sent to the Territory of Wyoming and the other to the Territory of New Mexico. The results of their investi gations within their limited time has fur nished to the department enlarged and Thev S' , " ,or " a « on «Pon th^subject They report a number of inclosures, and the area inclosed in these two territories far beyond what I have been led to ex^ct. HOW 

ILLEGAL OCCUPATION and possession of the public domain could gro r n to Bucb enormous proportions is beyond my comprehension. In its social moral and political aspect, not less in «ow e thM m,C R r f* U, . t8 ' the ««ten« 2nd ÄttKÜ 3SM represented that ÏÜBfite the entira grazing country wmt of the nn£ hundredth m*ridl*a hid becn lencSd by In of of for In has the of on and at the oi was pro and Sen pas a In In who that of de its of be an the him a to well and re and as the the sur is the the for de as of of of is cattlemen, I could not give credenre to the statement of such lawlessness and rapacity bnt the testimony of residents of tbe Terri tory who have no motive for misrepresen tation, corroborated by reports based on personal inspection of agents and survey ors Dow on record in the department established the fact. Indeed, it is publicly announced by the trespassers themselves, wbo not only acknowledged but they have unlawfully fenced in public lands that they justify tbeir action aud complain against the execution of the law as an oppressive and unjust hardship. 

PROGRESS OF TERRITORIES. In reviewing the reports of the Governor* of Territories already published in these dispatch« the secretary says: The general condition of the Territories shows marked and io some instances striking progress in population, tjxable property, settlement of land, education, mechanic, arts, road enterprises and many other of the element* which promise to make them -great and prosperous states in the future. The re port earnestly recommends that authority for the building of a railroad through the Yellowstone National Park be denied HEETINC OF COMGBÏ8S. Prelimlr ary Business and Matters to be Considered. Washington, December 5.—Tbe secoud session of the Forty-ninth Congess will be gin at noou to-morrow. After prayer and roll call each House will appoint a com mittee to inform the other of its readiness to proceed to business. New members who are to fill vacancies caused by death and resignation will then be sworn in. Upon tbe completion of formal organiz ation a joint committee will wait upon the Presi dent to inform that a quorum of each House is assembled and that Congress is ready to receive any communication he ■nay be pleased to'make. THE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE will then be received and after its readings formal announcement in the Senate of the death of Pike and of the deaths of repre sentatives Beach and Arnot will be made, folio* ed immediately by adjournment in respect to the memory to the deceased. A legislative business session is expected to begin on Tuesday. Among unfinished business in the senate is the vetoed private pension bill, reported from the Committee on Pensions with the recommendation that it be passed over the veto. The first of special orders is the Pacific Railroad funding bill, which has been at the head of tbe calendar since Ia6t Ma It is not known whether Mr. Hoar, who has it in charge will press it for considéra tion at once or suffer it to He over. Senator Platt's resolution for the con sidération of executive nominations open session is the special order for Wed nesday. and its consideration will be urged without further delay. With these three exceptions, no measure on the calendar in a position to command the attention the Senate during the week, the remaining special orders being assigned to days of the following week. The calendar contains "07 bills and res olutions from which number a majority the body will make its selection for consid eration. There is a prospect of an early agreement by confreres upon the inter state commerce bill. It is hardly proba ble that any business of consequence will be transacted in the House of Représenta tives duiing the early part of the week, report may be presented to the House by the confreres on the fortification and ap propriation bill which failed of enactment last se-sion by reason of the total disa greement of the confreres, in which .-vent new conference will be ordered. The Ap propriations Committee has made such progress in the preparation of the sundry civil appropriation bill that it is believed this measure can be reported to the House in about a week. If the temper of that body prove favorable the bill can taken up for immediate action, and fair progress made by the end of the week. Several measures of interest were made, continuing special orders atthelnst seesion and may be called up at any time if the House is so disposed. They are the Free Ship bill, Electoral Count bill. Pacific Railroad Funding bill, Washington, Da kota, Oklohama Territorial Admissio bids, Array Reorganization bill, and sun dry bills of minor importance reported from committees on Labor, Ways and Means, Banking and Currency, Agriculture, and Indian Affairs. Unfinished business for mornirg hours if the House decides to follow the routine is the bill to indemnify Chinese sufferers by the Rock Springe mas sacre. Not in order on this calendar is the hill providing for the construction of the Hennepin canal. 

ARREST OF A BIGAMIST of Who is Suspected of Murder and the Rob bery of the R I. Express Car. Chicago, December 5. —Henry Schwartz, formerly of Philadelphia,now inthecount; jail here charged with bigamy, is strongly suspected of being the man guilty of the daring robbery of the Rock Island express train last March when Kellogg Nichols, express messenger, lost his life and $37,000 was stolen from the express car. Schwartz for two years has been a brakeman on the Rock Island road. Friday right as he came out of the depot with his train au officer took him by the arm and marched him to Harrison street station. Yesterday he was arraigned for having married a wife in Philadelphia seven years ago and with having MARRIED A CHICAGO WOMAN two years ago. At his own solicitation his case was continued in $1,000 bail until December 14. At first he maintained a dogged silence but now volubly alleges that the Rock Island Company does not care whether he has one wife or a hundred if he er some one else can be sent to the peni tentiary for the robbery of the express car. He confesses that he has spent \uch mere money than he earned or coulcTTiave received frem home, but he is not ready to tell where the money came from. As brakeman, Schwarz was one of the crew OF THE II.L-FATED TRAIN in which the messenger was attacked. No suspicion was directed toward hi:n at once. When, in compliance with telegraphic instructions, Schwartz was returning to Chicago to attend the inquest, the conduc tor of the train found in the toilet room of the car, the one in which Schwartz was seated, a black hand bag which some one had tried to force down the closet pipe. It was empty, but sticking in the folds was a piece which looked like a part of a check. Schwartz was notably confused by the dis covery. Various minor circumstances pointed to him as the owner of the bag. Subsequent investigation showed that the torn bit of paper fitted into a mutilated check that was among the scattered con tents of the rifled express car. From that time Swartz WAS SHADOWED DAY AN.I) NIGHT. He was spending with a lavish hand money stolen from the express car, mostly bills of large denominations, and about $2,000 in $50 bills that Schwartz had been spending here and in the East were obtained by de tectives. From the first it has been con ceded that the crime was committed by a railroad man. Now the railway and ex press officials hope that the mystery of the cold-blooded murder and dariDg robbery is soon to be cleared away. Desperate Prize Fight. Pittsburg, December 5.—A desperate prize fight between Thomas Gillespie and David Jeffries, heavy weight iron workers, took place in the rear of Liggett's mill, Al legheny City, this afternoon. Eight rounds were.fought, with the advantage in favor of Jeffries, when his opponent struck him two powerful blows in the face, knocking him senseless. The fight was then given to Gil lespie. Opera House Burned. Washington, December 5.—Shortly be fore 3 o clock this morning a fire was dis covered under the stage of Herzog's Opera xloussjn this city, which in n short time enveloped the whole building in flames, aided by a strong wind and the inflamma ble material in tbe opera house.

He promised that at th» first sitting of the commi'tee he would state the reasons wh the measure was so urgent. Herren Longwerth and Von Zimmern op posed the bill on the ground that the prie ciple of the septennate deprived the coun try of the control of the government pol icy, and that maintaining a large armyfos tered a craving for conquest. The tenor of tbe debate is considered highly encouraging to the government. All sections under stand and approve of Gen.
