It ifl a very satisfactory document. A careful reading, we are ?iw, *?!? convince our readers thst it is iu 1 exhaustive, and as to both the utfi contained in it and the manner of! &eit exprewion, will compare without jjyardtfeuieut with most former Presi isotiil nieces. Iudeed, few mee have exhibited the same ? fb degree of statesmanship as this one. The remarks in regard to the past olence and present frauds in elections in south have tho riirht ring, and yet are x iach a dispassionate vein as to com s-nd them to thoughtful men of all par Hid recommendations in regard to education ol the masses, though trite, psrbipa. aro timely and appropriate tfoojh, and gain new force from their yre-en: connection. Tiiepsrt of the message devoted to the onaideration of "Civil Service Re jjra)" is worthy of special attention. i disposition has been shown by itveral papers ol Democratic prociivi rrt t0 retsr to the fact that this topic is fives so much attention at this time as ifllurtuniitu for the Administration. These remarks, based upon the brief synopsis of ?ieMenage heretofore given to the press, se any force they may have seemed to poafis when the words of the President ire at baud. The plan proposed as a itfia# oi .securing reforms which it is ttaem'.lv agreed are desirable, if not BH-ttsary, is worthy of the weighty con lideratiou of Uougress and the country, icdtiiH explanation of the partial failure ol reforms heretofore attempted, is entitled to attention. la n gird to the bold and unblushing tioUiim of the laws of morality 3nd de <?aey practiced by an isolated people in the A'e.n under the guise o! religion, the P;aident also makes some suggestions of a nature to arrest attention and projroke dbctueion.

Tii.tt there has bmm no persistent ttfjrt to slanjp out the evil must be re garded as the reverse of creditable to the tiweromeut, aud thn plan proposed by President Hayes should be welcomed, and it hand to be wise and practicable, put iaw operation. The review oi our foreign relations con taiaaianch reason f?r congratulation, and ?}taefi'i-e for anxiety. There eeems to no reason, however, to apprehend any reaaiu bat thosa niont acceptable to this ouatrv. from pending negotiations in re gsrd to the fisheries dillicolties, tho Pana ma canal project, or tho recent discourte liesto American vessels by .Spanish sea tteo. l'ne consideration of the needs of oirforeiirn commerce is fraught with in-1 tereat to public-spirited men, and will no j doubt receive that reception at the hands ol Congress which the magnitude of the interests concerned demands. The financial part of the paper has aUeady been forecast in our columns by the pub lication of the reports of different officials the Treaeury Department. We may repeat, however, that the showing made is most creditable, and must fee a source of considerable satis faction to partisans of Hayes's ad ministration. The recommendations in re* <aru to the coinage of silver are not to be lightly dismissed. Ihe President emphasizes the reco'm-| meatUtioas of Generals Shetman and Sheridan in relation to the adoption of a new policy for the conduct of our mili ary affairs, and also those of the Secre tary of the Navy concerning that Depart ment of the public service. The state ments about the two great rivers of the continent, and the recommendations in ? regard to their improvement, will commend themselves to our ?ead era as containing more than oanal interest to residents of the Ohio Valley. Tho complimentary allusion to Ueueral Grant, and tho suggestion for bin future, is manly and appropriate, and will commend the message to many who uiiijht otherwise be disposed to regard it with less favor. The review of Indian affairs, the workings of tho Agricultural Bureau, the Public lands Commission and other minor branches of the government, make up an fjyxMi of the situation of onr public iuterests, which is singularly free from causes of uneasiness, and fruitful of felicity for those who have the well-being of oar country close at heart. tiie HtaNAuE i.\thk m.ula.

ANNUAL MESSAGE ' fr >. ?; t vJ : ? OF Til i: FHCHIOEHT Of Till! DNITEl) NT AT EM. At llif Ojm uIhk of Ibe Sfcoiid of lite IonjHilxlb ('onirw-A Hlron*. Able and Manly Prfirotn lion of Perllueut Polnla (if Public Polity. Fdlotc-CUisau of Oir SniaU and IIoiw of Rqmtentaivtt: I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have bean blessed, during the past year, witb bealtb, with abundant harvests, with profitable employment for oil our people, and with contentment at home, and with peace and friendship with other nations. ?TKe. occurrence of tbe twenty*fourth electron of Chief Magistrate has afforded ?ncrther opportunity to the people of-the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the public servants whose terms of office are about to expire, to Iheir newly-chosen successors. This example cannot fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which republican institutions afford. Tbe inynediate, general and cheerful acquies cence of all good citizens in tbe result of tbe election, gives gratifying assurance to our country, and to its friends through out the world, that a government based onftbtfree consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses , elements of strerigtb, stability and permanency not found in any other form of government. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of citizen ship, conferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to the Consti tution, still prevails in several of the slaveholding States. It has, perhaps, no' been manitested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violence or in timid^tiqn. It has, however, !?y fraudu lent practices in connection with the bal lot"', with the regulations as in the places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning, amf canvar-sing the votes cast, been successful m defeating *he ?xeYcfoe of tbe rigbr preservative ot a'-l rghtr, the right of fcutTrjge, which the Couytituiion expressly confers upon .our enfranchised citizens. - . SECriOXAI.HSI ANli ITS KIN DUE0 

EVUJ. Tt is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in pur politics should disappear. They profffr that no secticu of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition tore fuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rights amendments 10 the Con stitution, is all that now stands in tne way of a,complete ? obliteration of sectional lines in'V>ur political contest!!. ATlong as either of these amendments is Ihgrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to As sume that the people who placed them in. the Constitution, as embodying the legiti mate results of the war for the llninn, and who believe them to be wise and neces sary, will continue to* act together, and to insist that they shall bte obeyed. The paramount question still is,as to the enjoy ment of the right by every American citi zen who has the requisite qualifications, to freely cast his vote and to have it hon. estlv counted. With this question rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the contentiona.pl the past; bygones will in deed 1* bygones; and political attt party ?refnes with respect to economy and effi ciency of administration, internal im provements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, tinance, and other important subjects, will then receive their full ahare of attention; hue resistance to and nullifi cation of the results of the war, will unite tcgather in resolute purpose for their sup port all who maintain the authority of the tfovernmtot and the perpetuity of the Unfon, and who adequately appreciate the | value of the victory achieved. This de termination proceeds from no hostile sea. timent cr feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our Government. They are the solemn ex pression of the will .of the people of the United States. The sentiment that the constitutional xighta of all our citizens must be main tained does not grow weaker. It will con tinue to control the Government of the country. Happily, the hiitory of the late election shows that in many parts of the countrv whore opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment h*s heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is lifceiy to caaae alto gether, if firm and well-considered action is taken by Congress. 1 trust the House of. Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, will see to It that every oaf* of violation of the letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment is thoroughly In vestigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It wijl be the duty of the Execu tive, with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citUsnsp( the righta guaranteed to them by the Con stitution. POPULAR IDt'CATIOS. ~ It is not, however, to be forgotten that the kest and surest guarantee of the pri mary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for celf-protectiou which can belong only to a people whose right to nnivereai suffrage is supported by univer sal education. The means at the com mand of the local and state authorities are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur nish Tree Intimation to all who need it. TbU is especially true where, before eman cipation, the edncationo/ th? people was neglected or prevented, in the interest* of slavery. Firmly convinced that the sub ject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the! | whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of the United States, I respectfully re comuosd that Congress, by suitable legis lation and wUb proper safeguards, supple ment the local educational funds in the several states where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been dieted on uneducated people, by devot ing to the purpose grants of the public land*, and, if necessary, by appropriations from the Treasury of the United btatea. Whatever the Government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue and social order pre vail. sod civil and religious liberty are secure. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the ur gent necessity of a reformation of the elvti-aerviee system of the government My viewe ?ou^rning the dangers of pat ronage, or appointments for personal 01 partisan considerations, b/w* Leer strengthened by my observation anxf c* jxerience in the Executive office, and I be lieve these dangers threaten the stability of the Government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tol erated. They tend to become more alarm ing with the enlargement of administra tive service, as the growth of the country in population increases the number of oiii oera and placemen employed. i * The reasobsarelmperitfvf fortheidop. tlo'n of flx?d ru!<8 for tne regulation nfat> pointments, promotions and removals, es tablishing a uniform method, having ex clusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal right* of all citizens, and the most economical and efficient administration of the public busi ness. .... Competitive examinations, in aid of iin partial appoiirtfientH and""ptoinotions," nave been conducted for ijome years in several of the Executive Departments, and by my direction this system hr.s been adopted in the custom-houses and pOBt odices of the larger cities of the countrv. In the city of New York over (wp thou sand positions in tW civfl-setviee have been subject, in their appointments and tenure ot place, to the operation of pub lished rules for this purpobe, during the past two years. The results of these prac tical trials have been very satisfactory, and have continued inv opinion in favor of tbis system of selection. All are sub jected to the same tests, and the result la tree from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for the po sition applied for the best qualitications attainable amoDg the competing appli cant* > It. ia an elfectuaf promotion^rom Ihe prapfbie^importjjnity jradr rj any other course pursued, largely exacts the time and attention of app?inting ofli cers, to their great detriment in the dis charge of other official duties, preventing the abnse of the service for the mere fur therance of private or party purposes, and leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the obligations imposed bv pat ronage, to depend solely upon merit for re tention arid didvar?*m$m, andjwith this constant incentive to exertion and im provement. These invaluable results have been at aiued in a high degree in the Mfices where :ho rules for appointment by competitive jxamination have-ijeen applied. A mfethod^btek-has stf'appfQvedinelf ?v experimentaUeata at points wherubuch ests may be fairly coneidered conclusive, f'nould be extended to all subordinate po rtions under the Government. I believe hat a strong and growing public senti ment demands immediate measuies for lecuring and enforcing tbe highest possi ble efficiency in the civftiervice, .and Jts wotectjoi^^on^eccgtnyd abuses, .4ld .hat the experience referred to Las ue nonstrated the feasibility of such meas ures. ? The examinations in the custom houses ind post offices have .been held oflder many embarrassments and without pro vision for compensation for tbe extra la bor performed by the officers who have conducted them, "and jvhoeo commendable interest in the improvement of tho public service has induced this devotion of time ind labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these lal>ora gratuitously aught not to bo expected, and without an appropriation By Congress for'compensa tion, it is not practicable- to extend the system of examinations generally through out the civil service. It is also highly im portant that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 17">3 of the Revised Statutes authorizes the President l,n?prescribe the regulations for Admission to the civil service of the L'nited States, and for this purpose to employ suit able persons to conduct the requisite in quiries with reference to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability, for the branch oi service into ,which he seeks to] enter;" buf the law is pjacticallv inopipra-1 Uve for gant of.the^^uisitg appropria tion. I therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meot the expensee nf a commission, to be appointed by the President in accofdence with the terms of this section, whcse duty it shalll be to de vice a just, uniform, and efficient system of competitive examinations,,and to super vise tbe application of the sftrrie through out'the entire civil service of the Govern ment. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the titness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of Congress as it will be to the President end heads of Departments, but lbat.it will'also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and constantly attend the con flicting claims of patronage betweeu the Legislative and Jtocecutive Departments. The moat effectual, check upon the perni cious competition of intluenwand official favoritism, in tbe bestowal of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicants, in which everv one can make his own record with the assnrance that his success will depend upon mis mono. i also recommend such legislation as, while leaving ovary officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opin ions and to use his means for thoir ad vancement, ehall also enablo him to feel as any privgte citizen in refusing all de mands_upon his salary ior political j??r poseir ATaw which snohlfl thns pnaran tee true liberty and justioe ta,all who are engaged in the public service, ar.d liLo wiao contain atrinyeat provisions again.4 tba uawof official anlhorfiy to poerpe the polirical aeiio?iif private' fcitfstens T)r 'o* official subordinates, is greatly to be de sired. 

EVILS OF TIIK SPOILS SYSTEM. The most serious obstacle, however, to J an improvement of .the civil service, afcd especially to a reform in tba method of I appointment frr.dTjftMovaT, Harbeen found '19 be the practice, und*?r what is known aa tbr? epoila system, by which the ap pointing power bca been so largely en i croached upon by.members of.Congress. The firat jrfeD in the reform of. tfite civil service mult be a complete" <J?vorre be* j tween Congress and the Kat-outi ve in the 'matterof appointments. The corrupting [doctrine that "to the victors belong the spoils," is inseparable from Congressional palroan;:Ga*lh?UM>tablulu;d rnlaiuuL prnc Itiiwotpartieain powfr. It cimeej to be understood t^applidrat#f6r officerSnd by I the people generally, that ueprafontatives land Senators are entitled to dfaborce the patronage oi thair respective districts anil state?. It is not necessary to recite at longtl* the eyil? resulting from this ipvj sioa oj tlw* Executive Juncuins. The trne principle oT government on the sub ject of appointments to ottice, n? atatud in the National Conventions of the .leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American people, and have not been called in ques tion in any ?inarter.ThepeauthenticexpreS' filoU or p^fhlip opinion upon this all-im portant subject. we tne ftatajirpt of prio ciples that belong to the conatltuttonai ftninture of the government. ?'Under the Constitution, the Preaiden and heads of Departments are to mak< nominations for ofllce. The Senate is t< adviap ana'ponWnt to appointments, am the House of KeppsfeutatirM &io accuse ftnil prosecute faithlera officers. The be* i.?ter?jfc oi tb$ public service demand that these distinctions be respected; tha Seiiatora and Kspresentatires. -who ma' be judge* ami ajttuaers, should not dictat appointmenta to office." To this end th co-operation of the Legislative Pepan tnent oi the trovernment ia requited, alik by the necettlties of the Carfe and *by put Uc opinio:?. Members of Congress wi not ne tetters iroiu ijje demanda mad upon them with reference to appointment! to office until, by legislative enactment, the pernicious practice is condemned and forbidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the relations of mem* bora of Congress with respect to appoint* i iripnt tooliice by the President, and I also recommend that the provisions ot section 1787, ana of the'wctfons following, of the Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure* of-otfice act, of march 2,1867, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only bv the co operation of the Legislative and Executive Departments of the Government, I again commend the whole subject to your con siderate attention. . TUX UTAH EVIL* . It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to sup press polygamy where it now exists in our Territories, and to prevent its extension. Faithful aud zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Expe rience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires ex euaion, modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian or ganization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries, it! poetesses large influence over thu admin istration of justice. Fxerciiiag, asthe heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the law of | Congress on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement Polyg amy wiil not be abolished if the enforce ment of the law depends on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only bo suppressed by taxing away the politi I ctl power of the sect whlchencourages and fuetains It. The power of Congress to en act suitable laws to protect the Territories l is ample. It is not a case of half-way measures. The political power of the Mor mon sect is increasing; it controls now I'one of our wealthiest and most populous | Territories. It is extending steadily into | other Territories. WhereveT it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian politi cal power. The sanctity of marriage and j the family relation are the corner-stone of our American society and civilization. I Religious liberty and the separation of ! Church and State are among the element ary ideas of free institutions. To re-estab lish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have imper illed, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, in a great degree, closed to general immigra tion by intolerant and immoral institu tions, it is rrcommended that the govern ment cf Utah be reorganized. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a Governor aud Judges, or Commissioners, appointed by the President and conflrmea by the Senate?a government analogous to the provisional government established for the Territory, north west of the Ohio, by the ordinancO of 17S7. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recommend that 'he right to vote, hold office, and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah, be con fined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures ar? adopted, it ia believed that within a few years the evils that now alliict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in good time become one of the moat prosperous and attractive of the new States of the Union. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. ? Oar relation&ii-ith all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for con cern as t"> their continued maintenance' My anticipation of an early reply from the British Government to the demand of indemnity to our fishermen for the in juries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay, in January, LS76, which I expressed in my last annual message, was disap pointed. This answer was received only in the last part of April in the present year, and, when received, exhibited a fail ure of accord between the two govern ments, an to the measure of the inshore fishing privilege secured to our fishermen bv the Treaty of Washington, of so serious & character, that I made it the subject of u commnuication to Congress, in which I recommended the adoption of the measures which teemed to me proper to be taken by this government in maintenance of the rights accorded to our tiabermen under the treatv, and towards securing an In demnity for the' injury these interest had suffered. A bill to carry out these recom mendations was under consideration by the Houie of Representatives at the time of the adjournment of Congress in June last. Within a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's Gov ernment, renowing the consideration of the subject, both of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay, and of the inter pretation of the treaty in which the pre vious correspondence had shown the two Qovernmenta to be at jrariense. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a-friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an indemnity for the transaction at Eortone Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to farther conference, and by an asspnt to the view of this Government, presented in the pre vious correspondence, that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of the Provincial sea-coasts, and the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be made the sfabject of conference and concurrent iir-atwuient between' the two Govern ments. 1 sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of viawa in the inter pretation of the fishery clauses of the Treaty of Washington, which, as the cor respondence between the two Govern ments stood at theolose of the laat session of Congrets, seemed to be Irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts and industries, which was held laat year at Sydney, New South Wales^s well as that now in progress at Melbourne, tlie United States have been efficiently and honorably tcprefpnted. The exhibitors from this countiy at the former place received a latge number of awards in some of tho most considerable departments, and tng participation of the United States was rerogniteil by a special mark of distinct ion. In the exhibition at Melbourne, the share taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of success is confidently expected. THE 

ATTITUDE OP EUROPEAN POWERS TOWARD OCR GOVERNMENT The state of peace and tranquility now enjoyed by all the nations of the conti nent of Europe haa its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial rela : tions with them.

Pugh, successor of George S. Houston, o! Alabama, ana Jamea E. Brown who succeeds Gen. Gordon, of Georgia, took the oath of office. The credentials of Senator Edmunds, re-elected his own successor, were re ceived. The annual report of the Secretary of the Senate was ordered printed, also a communication from the Attorney General explaicing the methods of diatributing the appropriations for that Department. The Vice President was proceeding to lay other communications before the Sen ate when Mr. Thurman suggested that it would be more orderly to wait notification if the Houbo was in session, and offered a resolution, which was agreed to, directing the Sec. etary to inform the House of the readine&nof the Senate for business. A committee was also appointed to in form the President that Uae Senate was readv for business, and a recess was tcken till 12:4b. The committee not being ready to re port at that hour a further recess was taken till 1:30. Soon after the reassembling the Senate Secretary W. K. Rogers appealed and de livered the message of the President and it was read. The reading of the message was con cluded at three o'clock. It was ordered printed. On motion of Mr. Wallace the Senate adjourned until 12 o'clock to-morrow. 

SENATE COMMITTEES. Upon adjournment of the Senate this afternoon the Democratic members held a caucus for the purpose of revising the list of the Senate committees. The only change in the membership of the Senate since last summer being the admission of Pugh in place ol Pryor, as Senator from Alabama. It was agreed that the standing committees should be reappointed with out another change than the substitution of Pagh's name for that of Pryor on the Committees of Privileges and Elections and Claims. It was next decided to drop from the list of select committee* the fol lowing which have completed their in vestigations and submitted reports: Sena tor Wallace on "Alleged frauds in the late election," Senator Ktrkwood on the "lie1 raoval of Northern Cheyenne and Ponca Indians to Indian Territor>;." and the selectcoinmittee, of which Senator Davis (W.

Jona than Scoville, member from the Thirty second New York district, took the iron clad oath of office. After appointment of the customary commissioners to notify the Senate and President of readiness for buBinbbs, the Speaker called for bills and resolutions. Under a call of the States thirty-one bills and resolutions were introduced in the fjoose to day, among them the fol lowing: By Mr. Converse: Fixing the salary of the "President at $25,000 per annum, pay able monthly. By Mr. YVard: Appropriating $100,000 for the monument of lien. Lafayette, to be erected upon the tield of tho battle of Brandy wine. Mr. Calkins, of Indiana, introduced a resolution reciting the allegation that there was in the Washington postoffice certain bags of mail matter which were attempted to be sent through the mails under a frank, although they did not contain frankable matter, and calling on the Postmaster General for a report of all the facts relat ing to the detention of such mail matter. By Mr. Cox, of New York: A resolution requesting the President to communicate to the House any correspondence and treaties with China having reference to emigration and commerce between the two countries. By Mr. Hurd, of Ohio: A joint resolu tion relative to tariff. It declares that legislation on tariff should be governed by the following principles: First?That tariff iu a tax on imported goods, which is ultimately paid by the consumer. Second?That a tariff for protection, so called, does not, in most cases, protect tne interest it pretends to protect. Third?That a protective tariff does not increase the wages of workingmen. Fourth?That the protective tariff builds up one citizen at the expense of another. Fifth?That the protective tariff disturbs the primal law of trade, which governs exchanges by the supply and demand, Sixth?That the protective tariff has driven American commerce from the high seas. Seventh?That tho protective tariff in creases the probability of the .crime of smuggling. Mr. Bicknell, of Indiana, inquired if it was in ordor to take up at this time the Senate joint resolution prescribing a meth od of counting the electoral vote. Mr. Keife'r, of Qhio?Why calMt up now J Mr. Bicknell?For the purpose of voting upon it. Pending aotion, the President's Message was received and read. At first the Message was listened to with some attention, bnt after a few pages bad been read the members generally entered into conversation, and but few followed to the end. The reading occupied two hours. The meseage was referred to a committee ol the whole. Mr. Bicknell again endeavored to call upon the Senate a joint resolution propos ing a joint rule for counting the electoral vote, the consideration of which had been postponed until to-day. Mr. Weaver raised the poipt of order that the day being Monday, the gentleman could not take the floor anjl prevent the members Trom moving to suspend the rules. ?he Speaker ruled that the {potion to suspend tho rules was one of the privileges. He wished, however, that the question bo permitted to lie ever to day, so as to afford him opportunity to enquire whether the joint resolution presented the question of privilege. . Mr. Conger objected to that course. He did not desire iny continuing orden. Mr. Cox, of New York?Give as a vote on it. Mr. Conger?No. Mr. Bicknell demanded a decision as to whether bis joint resolution presented a question of privilege. Mr. Conger moved to adjourn, pending which Mr. Briggs announced the death of i his colleague, E. W. Farr, and then the House adjourned. The Senate joint resolution not being a continuing order, cannot come np to-mor row except as a privileged question; but the Speaker will undoubtedly be called upon to decide that question. Mr. Weaver desired to offer the follow ing resolution to day: Wukrsas, Grave abuse* exist in the management of commerce between States whereby the producing and shipping in terests of the country are constantly com pelled to pay moBtunjnst and exhorbitant rates for transportation; therefore, Rcaolvcd, That in the judgment of this House, it is the duty of the General Gov ernment to at once exerciae its constitu tional right to regulate commerce between the States by the paseage of such laws, and establishing such regulations as will secure to the whole people just and impartial rates for the transportation of both freight and passengers.

Referring to the election lawe. the Attorney General Bays: "While I bellevo there has been a Bteady progress of sentiment in fAvor of the election laws of the United States, and of their honest execution, aud while in certain portions of the Union the Con gressional elections have been peacefully and.honestly conducted where, heretofore, there has been just cauEe for complaint, yet information from many districts has satisfied me that recent Congressional elections were there accompanied bv Buch open violations of law aud such gross frauds aa to demand the attention of Congress and perhaps additional legislation. Meet ings assembled for the peaceful advocacy of the merits pf candidates hove been re peatedly urokeu up entirely or invaded by bands of armed rutlians.' In some in stances public avowal lias been made of the intention to act, aud public invitation to that effect, while no effort was made by the local authorities to prevent such outrages. Violence and intimidation are not reported to have occurred however to the extent that prevailed in the elections of 1S7U and 1878. I respectfully submit to the consideration of Congress whether the time has not now arrived when an elec tion law should be passed which shall take into the control of the United States offi cials selections for members of Congress.
