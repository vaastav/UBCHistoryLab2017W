The time of grace having oxplrcO , his orders declaring paclficos or country aettlere who did not by a certain day remove with their families Into towns garrisoned by Spanish trorw | to bo without the pale of the law , are now being rigidly carried Into effect.

Private Information from Cuban sources Just reverse the figures. The correspondents of Madrid Journals are Indignant at the rcfueal of General Weyler'a press censor to allow them to cubic the facts to Madrid , and say , too , that It General Weyler continues his present efforts to con ceal the truth from the people of Spain , who are making sc | many sacrifices to supply the necessary alnews of war , ho Is doomed to early recall and personal disgrace. The representatives of the Liberal and the Hcr- aldo o'f Madrid , find themselves compelled , . . . . Havana 'to6eh'd' the Inilk'of their dispatches to Key West for transmission therefrom. The Lucha , In a significant editorial , makes between the lines , n most vigorous protest , warning General Weyler that neither poli ticians nor generals , who would bo popular and ouccfssfnl , must forget that the press l/i fiftfMt ttilnrlitlnt * tltntt ( ( in fit id nin nnf bo trampled upon or nnubbed with Impunity , that the whole world respects it , and that no ono man , however despotic or arbitrary , can absolutely control it.

WEYLER'S FUTURE PROGRAM. I learn from seemingly trustworthy authoi- Hy that General Weyler will return hereon on or about the 7th to welcome his son , now on the way here from Spain. Whllo ho is In Havana. It Is expected that the captain general will Icsue a new proclamation , claim ing that peace has been virtually restored In Plnar del Rio and Havana provinces , but declaring at the same time that the scat tered groups of Insurgents still remaining there under Macco and Agulrrc's direction are simply bunds unworthy of pursuit by the regular army. Ho will leave them to bo hunted down by mounted forces of the civil guard and local guerrillas , while he turns hU attention to Mntauzas und the central and eastern districts , now overrun by the rebel armlcf ) of Gomez , Callxto , Garcia and Lacret. A committee of army and navy officers has been appointed with Instructions to take Immediate steps to strengthen the coast and harbor defense ! ) of Havana and other Cuban ports of Importance.

HO.JV would expect ft-om an attorney general having1 his high- Ideals of public duty. - . I can recall some dlscucslon of the char acter and qualities of Judges Strong and Uradley among meinbcrae.t the cabinet , but not a single word of reforcnpo to their opin ions , on the legal tender .question or to any case pending , or likely to' bo pending In the supreme court. Nothingc'c.ould bo plainer than that the attorney.general -was earn estly determined to recn.ilrtond only such men as combined the qualities of able luw- ycrn with those of perfectly pure , single- minded and upright citizens. When the nominations were madeVlve felt that Just such men had been selected. I .am the more Hiiro Uhat I would have been quick to notice anything Inconsistent with the goer pur pose I have described , bedauce , as a matter of fact , my personal convictions then were and still arc that the opinion of Chief Jus tice Chase In Hepburn versus Grlswold , as well no la the subsequent Icgill tender cases , so-called , was the betterjnno In law , and a sounder ono In statesmanship , ns well as a solid barrier against nil forms of fictitious or "flat" money.

The charge to which you call my attention Is this : That In the year 1S7U the supreme court was packed by "President Grant for the purpose of reversing the legal tender derision In the case of Hepburn against Grlswold. and that , whcn the names of Messrs , Strong and Uradlry were sent to the senate In February , . 1870 , the nature of the decision In the above named case , although It had not been Announced from the bench , was known fo the president and cabinet. I was a member of General Grant's cab inet at the time mentioned and I was pres ent at one or more cabinet meetings when the subject was considered and when opin ions were expressed us to the fitness of Messrs. Strong and Hntdley for the vn- cent places upon the bench of the su preme court. The legal tender controversy was not spoken of nor In' any manner re ferred to by the president nor by any mem ber of the cabinet. IndcctI the conversa tion was limited. Strpng and Uradley were then without controversy at the head of the profession In the states of Pennsyl vania , New Jersey , Maryland and Dela ware. At that time there was a Justice on the bench from Now Kngland , ono from New York and ono from'the Pacific coast and four from the central states of the west. At that time the south was not con- Biuprcu. Since the controversy was opened the statement linn been mada that Judge Strong had recognized the constitutionality of the legul tender law In his place as Judge of the supreme court of Pennsylvania. I can not say whether that rapt was known to the president or to any member of the cab inet. but there waft no , rcforcnco to the opinion of cither Strong or nrndley. Very truly. GUORGtJ S.

TO COMPETE WITH CARNEGIE John D , Rockefeller Intonth to Piguro as Y a Now Iron King. BIO PLANT TO BE BUILT NEAR CHICAGO Standard Oil Mmrmitf One * Into Slccl Hull Mint Armor I'latc Iti uu III * Own Account niul I on a I < nrKc Scnlo. CHICAGO , Dec. C. A morning paper makes the following announcement : John D. Rockefeller is seeking to outdo Andrew Carnegie as an Iron king , and has plans al ready matured and about to be carried out aiming nt that end. The Standard Oil com pany , directed by Rockefeller , will bo the fee of the Scotchman. This company has purchased In South Chicago along the shores of Lake Michigan and at the mouth of the Calumet river a plot of ground several acree In extent and with a water frontage * of 3,200 feet. On this , H Is sai rolling mills will bo erected , to ccst 110,000,000 , and pos- olbly twice that amount. With this plant for manufacture , with the vast mines In the -3'rasaba region for the raw product , and with eighteen tank vessels to carry the ore to the very doors of the works , all owned by the Rockefeller company , that corporation may bo able to dictate tcrmo to Mr. Carno- gle and his associates , Instead of being dic tated to. Mr. Rockefeller's scheme la not now. He has had it In mind for several ycaro , but not until now has he been ready to put It Into effect. His prcllmlnaty movements have , as usual , been kept quiet. Not until today did anything reach the public , and then accidentally. Some weeks ago a large plot of land was purchased In South Chicago. The sellers were the Calumet Canal and Dock company , and several private Indi viduals ; the real buyer waa not publicly known. The price was In the neighborhood of $500,000 , divided Into three payments. The first Installment waa paid when the dcc-d waa signed , and the next two will be made December 15. It was not necessary that Mr. Rockefeller should divide the sum. The Iron and steel business at leant that part of It dealing In steel rails la controlled entirely by Carnegie and his two allies , the Illinois Steel company of Chicago , and the Colorado Fuel and Iron company of Pueblo , Colo. The prlco of ralKi at I'lttsburg la $23 , at Chicago $29 , at Pueblo $33 , whichever of these three concerns 1s nearest the purchns- ciu , gets the order. Ralfa cannot bo had of any ono else. This Is the situation which Mr. Rockefeller hc tackled. Ho expects to make steel ralla from 25 to 50 per cent cheaper than the trust can and can sell them much cheaper. The new mills at South Chicago cage will not bo confined to the manufacture ot stccJ rails , however , but will make struc tural Iron of all starts 03 well. It la stated further , and on good author ity , that Mr. Rockefeller may even go Into the armor plate business. The site of the now worKa is good ror a mammotn roiling mill. The river at this point Is twenty feet In depth , enough to float the largest lake vessels , and provides a perfect entrance for the Standard Oil ehl , which will carry ore from the mines aT 'Lake ' Superior. These same boats will ocrvo as a powerful whip In the hands of the Standard Oil magnate. In case .the .railroads attempt to fight him , for they can also be used for the'grain trade , and literally demoralize freight rates In every , direction. ! , . CHEA11 TELKIJIIOXKS FOR ST. LOUIS. * GlKiiiillc Deal to Include Varloun Klcvtrlcnl EiiteriirlHCN. ST. LOUIS , Dec. 0. A gigantic deal , In volving a revolution In the telephone and electric lighting business of St. Louis , has been consummated. Three big companies with an aggregate paid up stock of nearly $3,000,000 , have been organized by about twenty of the most prominent and -wealthy cltlicils of St. Louis. Ono of the companies will Introduce a new telephone system In St. Louis at much lower service rates than Uicno prevailing at present. It will estab lish a home telephone plant which will In time extend to neighboring points. The second company , owned by the same per sons , will operate an Immense electric plant , supplying power of all kinds for public and private use. The third company will con struct the telephone and clcctrl ; plants for the two other companies , manufacture the equipments and will construct a complete system of underground conduits. A fourth company Is also In the deal , but It will not figure In the proceedings at present. The local capitalists Interested In the new com panies arc : E11U Walnwrlght , Adolphus Uusch , August Gehner , Sam M. Kennard. Julius S. Walsh , Rolla Wells. Charles H. Turner. William F. Nolker , William T. Haar- tlck , William F. Marquard Forstcr , Henry Nicholas , George J. Kobuscb , Philip Stock , Lawrence B. I'lcrce , IJrecklnrldgo Jones , C. K. D. Walsh. Otto Von Schrader , Wil liam D. Orthwcln and II. S. Priest. The Klnloch Telephone company Is the name of a concern chartered at Jefferson City Sat urday , with a paid up capital stock of $1,500,000. The corporators were the St. Louisiana just named , and Hionklns J. Han- ford of Evanston , III. , and James H. Par ish of Brooklyn , N. Y. The capital stock of the company , however , will all bo taken by the St. Louis parties. Articles of In corporation of the St. Louis Electric and Construction company , with a fully paid capital of $000,000 , were filed In the re corder's office of this city. The papers con tain the same list of Incorporators. Late yesterday afternoon the same gentlemen held a meeting and clcccd a , deal which put them In possession of the Citizens' Electric Lighting and Power company and the Telephone - phone and Telegraphic Service company , both of which have had but a nominal business for many years. The Citizens' Electric Lighting and Power company wan then practically organized with a fully paid capital stock of $750,000 and officers were elected. The deal Is one of the largest ever ac complished In St. Louis , and Its effects arc far reaching. The combination was made for the avowed purpose of revolutionizing the telephone and general electrical busi ness In St. Lout * . The local capitalists start out with the announcement that the new telephone company will provide tele phones at $36 per year for residences , $50 for physicians and $ GO for business houses , The present telephone rate Is $100 per year for the Hell telephone service. The new company will open general offices next week and will at once get out and hustle after prospective subscribers. The local capital ists apparently mean business , as they filed their applications for conduit space with the Hoard of Public Improvements late yea- tcrday afternoon and also filed four bonds aggregating $140,000 with the mayor and council ,

The much discussed steamship line from Japan to a southern California port , which Japanese capital la said to have been toying with for some months , will bo owned by Ameri can ! . The press dispatches from Chicago stated that E. C. Potter , son of 0. AV. Pot ter , the noted financier of that city , Is working on the rutablUhment of such a steamship line. It Is learned from Secre tary Wlllard of the Chamber of Commerce that the nown Is correct , uud that the en terprise U In a fair way to bo uucces ful , Mr. Potter has been In southern California for Homo dayct , and la now at the Coronado hotel. The project li hacked by himself In connection with the larger holders of Santa Fe securities and the Cramps , ship builders at Philadelphia. The project will not be olllclally connected with the Santa Fe railway , but will bo In full sympathy With that corporation. TheH ltat stock will bo about $10,000,000.

The tlmo on freight will also be materially reduced and rates consider ably reduced. The whole enterprise Is based on the lines of magnificence and the greatest popslblo speed , with the ex pectation of depriving the Canadian Pacific of Its trade and the English Peninsular & Oriental company of a good proportion of theirs. The service Is to bo ecmt-mnnthly at least. The port has not been selected , but Is likely to bo San Diego until San Pedro Is made a deep water harbor. iv.\cin.\o i.v ot Mm.

A special to the Journal from Lexington , Mo. , eays : At about 1 o'clock this ( Monday ) morning a mob of Ray county farmers broke Into the county jail here , secured Jesse Winner and James Nelson , held for the murder of Mrs. Winner and her two babies , and lynched them. The mob broke Into the jail with little dllllculty and speedily accomplished their object of meting out punishment to the alleged butchers. Lon Lackey , who has also been In jail under a clmrgo of complicity lu the murder , was taken to Richmond Satur day , which fact alone saved his life , as he would certainly have been lynched with the others. The probabilities are that vcngoanco will be mctcd out to him later , possibly before morning. Several attempts were made to lynch Winner and Lackey , whllo they were In jail at Richmond , which led to their re moval hero for safekeeping. Nelson has been In Jail hero only since Saturday , hav ing been arrested on the strength of a con- fccalon made by Miss Maggie Katron , who made a sworn statement that she , Winner , Lackey and Nelson committed the murder. The crime for which Win ner and Noaon ! were lynched was the brutal butchery of Mis. Winner , wife of the lynched man and of Clara Win ner , aged 3 years , and Pearl Winner , a boy aged 18 months. The Winners lived north- cast of Richmond. On October 26 Winner left homo for a day or tv.v > and the next day Mrs. Winner and the two children were found with their throats cut. Mrs. Winner's head had also been split 'with an axe. Her body lay Just outride the house and war frightfully mutilated by hogs before It was dlocoverr-d. CO.VfJllHSS OK I.AIIOU M T WHISK.

( ration Tutu * ulltt Many I'nrty Lenders on ( IncMlloit of l.etf- and Appoint men IN , WASHINGTON , Dee. 6 , That tonight was the eve of a new wsslon of congress was apparent In the Washington hotelp , which are always barometers of political activity under the dome. Sonatoro ami members com ing to the city by every train , reinforced by the attaches and lookers on of coiiKreiw , were drifting Into the lobbies , greeting ono another Ilka schoolboys after a vacation ; with much handshaking , with reminiscences cf the campaign nnd many explanations of how their re-election or defeat had been brought about. There had boon comparatively small Interest In the work of the coming session Ityolf , apart from the prMldcut'ii message , but clouds of speculation were afloat dealing with the politics of tlio new administration to bo Inaugurated on the 4th of March and with the personnel of the cabinet. It was unani mously conceded that the republican program wna to Ignore the Dlngley tariff bill and to summcn an extra session of tinFiftyfifth congress ) for the ICth of March for the pur- poao of passing a new tariff measure , so thc o features of the situation which have absorbed the attention of palltlclans recently had ceatild to bo of Interest. In their place came the cabinet predictions and the meyaigo. Curiosity was expressed over what reference , If any , Prci-ldcnt Cleveland might make to the Issue and the result of the presidential campaign , and particularly as to his policy upon the Cuban question. The central figure of the night was Mr. Marcuo A. Hanna , who Is looked upon hero as the advance agent of the McKlnloy ad- mlnlotratlon , with a commission to feel the pulse of congress and to cammunlcato the policy ot the president-elect to the leaders. When Mr. Hanna appeared In ttio Arling ton lobby after hlo dinner , accompanied by II. C. Payne of Wisconsin , who Is scheduled as a cabinet probability ; C. W. Dawcs ot Chicago , n member of the republican com mittee , and General Horacci Porter , the mar shal of the Inauguration parade , the party was surrounded by congressmen and other politicians , who escorted them to Mr. Hanna's room ? . Tlio republican chairman had been Invisible during the day , trying to put aside politics for Sunday , ho explained ; but throughout the evening ho wao beset by visit ors. Some ot the most consplcuojo men about the hotel , most of whom talked with Mr. Hanna during the evening , were Senators Platt of Connecticut , and Aldrirli of Hhodo Island ; Chairman Babeock and Vice Chair man Mercer of the congressional campaign committee ; General Grosvrnor of Ohio , Con gressmen LMcey cf Iowa , Glllctt , McCormack and Wilson of New YorK. KCBS , uciunap auu Larimer of llllncls , Chairman Cinnon of the committee * on approptlatlons , and "Deacon" S. V. White , the Now York financier , who served a term In congress and pcldom falls to attend the opening of a session. With most of his callow ? Mr. Ilsnna did much listening and little talking. The chief pur pose of his visit , to make preliminary ar rangements for the Inauguration ceremonies , was dropped over Sunday. MARK HANNA'S BUSINESS. Mr. Hanna had breakfasted with Con- in-cssrnan Buttcrworth of Ohio and with W. W. Dudley , former commissioner of pensions , and had opent the afternoon driving with Senators Sherman of Ohio and Proctor of Vermont. Regarding the position of chair man ot the Inauguration committee , which has been tendered to Mr. S. W. Woodward , a prominent business man of the city , Mr , Payne eald : "Mr. Woodward will glvo a definite answer tomorrow. He fears that the duties of the position would take more tlmo than ho could spare from his biiBlncss. Ho has talked with othcta who have been con nected with Inauguration committees , who tell him that ho would bo obliged to devote two-thirds of Ma tlmo this winter to the work. He does not feel that he can male : the sacrifice. Mr. Payne said emphatically that Mr. Woodward's hesitation waa not Inspired by the objections made against him. by local republicans on the ground that ho la a gold democrat. Mr. Woodward will glvo a definite reply tomorrow. The visit to Washington of Mr. Dawca of Chicago Is enlil to be connected with the proposition to maintain permanent republican headquarters at the capital , which will bo discussed whllo Mr. Hanna Is here. Chairman Babeock of the congressional committee wca noncommit tal when asked whether his organization would Join with the national committee/ the project , saying the matter would have to bo dlsciifdcd by the committee. Interest In the affairs of the Hawaiian republic haa been rekindled' by the dinner which was given Saturday night by ex-Secretary of State * John W. Footer to Mr. Hanna. The guests , numbered a dozen , Include. ! the Hawaiian minister of foreign affairs , ilr. Cooper , who U lii the city , Minister Hatch and Secretary Hastings of the Hawaiian legation , and half a dozen members of the senate committee an foreign relations , among thorn Senators Mor- irnn _ Hnln nnil I.adun. who nrn flili'nmtcct of annexation. It Is believed that the move ment fur annexation la to bo brought forward again , with the advent of the next admlns- tratlon. and It Is likely to lie ono of the leading nitrations with which President Mc- Kinlcy and the Fifty-fifth congress will have to deal. Vice President Stevenson , who is now In the city , will call the senate to order at noon on Monday. Tlio first day of the pjii'lon will bo dovntod almost entirely to receiving tlio president's message providing It Is sent in on Monday as It la generally conceded It will be. Immediately after tlio opening prayer , committees will bo appointed to notify the president and the titut'3 of representa tives that the nenatc Is organized and ready to recclvo communications and proceed with bucilneu' . The ecmitu will then In all proba bility take n recess until It bccomcu known whether the president will fend his mes sage In on that day. If procedcnte are fol lowed there will bo an adjournment Boon after the receipt of the mew2o. | {
