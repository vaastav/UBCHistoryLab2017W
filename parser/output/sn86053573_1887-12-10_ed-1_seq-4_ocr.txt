The pcoplo ore. more ittcrcsttd In cheap mutton than they aro In freo wool. Some Republicans favor placing suaiar on thefreo list; others, oppose. It as Inconsistent with the prlnclplo of protection. It this latter class prove to be In the maorlty, then all Itepubllcans should unite In wiping out hll Internal revenue taxes, including whisky, anil all the machinery for Its collection. Tlio Kinncellcal Alliance. More than two thousand delegates, com teg from every country ot tho world and repreecntlcg every phaee ot religious thought except that taught by tho Romin Catholic Church, have, been assembled In this city for tho past three days In a general Christian conference, under tho auspices ot the Evangelical Alliance. This convocation Is ono ot the most nota ble that could have assembled In any part of tho world, representing, as It does, the conccDiusof the religious thought of over one hundred million people. But It Is not only In tha ideas rcpro tented, but In the men who represent them, that this conference under tho auspices ot tho alliance. Is distinguished. Many ot tbe ablest divines of the 1'rotcstant Christian churches have been consulting tojttucr for days with numbers ot the leading hy men ot their various congregations upon questions of the gravest Import. The evangelization of the churches, tho bringing them Into closer union with the people, is ono ct tho great objects of tho conference Just closed. It seeks to abolish pew holding and other modorn Ideas that have penetrated Into the churches and have made distinctions that are unknosrn to and not consonant with the doctrines taught by the divine founder of tbe church. Many ablo papers have been lead before the CQLferencc upon subjects ot Interest, not only to those connected with the cburcbtr, but to all the cl'.lzens of this coui.tr' und the people ot the world. The meeting of this conference Is another proof ot tbe necessity for the erection In tbls city of a grand ball capable of setting several thousand porsous. Not even the delegates to tbe conference could at any time get together Jn any building fn Wash ington. The wot Is of tho conference Is close, Its members will soon bo separated, gome go ing to "the uttermost parts of thooutu," but tho iceults of the meeting will bo felt for gocd during "all tho coming years. Theie Are Worse Things Thun n Sur plus. The New York Sim, In on editorial on "Why tho Internal revenue should bo touched first," says : There is nothing Immutable, lacvltablo la tho surplus; even with tho taxes as they are. In ono year from to day, In stx months, per haps In three months, anew condition of af fairs may arise. which will require cery dol lar of tho revenue that now goes Into tho treas ury, aud moro, too. No tarlfUtateemanshlp Is worthy of .respect If, In dealing with tho fact ot & surnlus, It rails likewise to take Into consideration tho posal Willy of a deficiency in thonear future. lug internal revenue tax is nroscrly tho emergency tax. It Is always odious, but It can bqiaKcnoff and restored again with far less disturbance to the business Interests of tho country than must result from equivalent changes in tho customs tariff. I.cavo this lax untouched, and mako the reduction colcly In tho. customs duties, and then what happens In tho evont of a changed candltlou of afTalrs, demanding moro rovenuo than the new Khedulcs produce 1 Tho margin of safety Is no lODger available. It has been used. It Is no longer there e The additional revenue must bo raised by In ternal taxatlon-jiot by Intcrnaltaxatloa la Its least oflcnslvo form; that Is to say, upon alco hol and tobacco, lor tboy are already taxed, hut by levying new taxes upon other products ot homo manufacture, perhaps directly upon tho earnings and savings of tho citizens. The tborl-ilghtcd poller of surplus reduction, which lets (he Internal revenuo tax stand In order to get a back at the outtovns duties In tho Interest of free trado, shapes its way straight toward tho lucomo tax, that most hateful and oipieislvo of all Imposts. Tbe surplus Is a bad tblnj, but thcro aro worse things than a surplus. Tho .Sim Is right. There aro worse thing tLon n surplus. Tho Itep-ibltcan part when it camo into power found an empty treasury and tbe country without credit. These aro worse than a surplus and were tho result ot Democratic financiering. The same remit would follow a few years of Democratic rulo now, ot which fortunately there Is no danger, Tho Itepubllcans, with an appreciation of the needs of tho country and of how to trull o It great, rich, and prosperous, enacted laws by which an ample royenue was col lected. Under their rule it became so rich and prosperous that the Income exceeded the greatest needs, and tbe Democrats do cot teem to possess ability enough to re duce the Income without ruining tho coun try. But tho Republican, party did mors than to provide an ample incomo for tho gov ernment, making It the richest In the world, and with tho best credit. It made tbftpeoploilch. InlSfiOUje valuation of property in tho United States was less than that of Ureal Britain by $8,478,000,000. In thst porlod this couutiy has been embarrassed in Its progress, by, agrat wari.and, yet at tho end uf twenty .years' it has overtaken, add jiaestd Great Britain In tbe face, and In 1SS0 bad $3,878,000,000 mora of wealth, than bar free trade rival had In 1983. Do such ftcts show that protection has hampered tho de velopment of Industry In this country ? Mr. Mulhal), tho most rellablo of Eng lish statisticians, falls to give tho full value of allot (treat Britain's manufactures, but In 1853 wo find that they amounted to t 000,000,000, whllo In the United Statos In lbSO the product ot tho manufactories was valued at $5,GOO,000,000. A comparison of tho cotton and wool production of tbe two countrlosctn.be easily made, and the results aro sUrtllng. The value of the cotton and woolen pro ducts ot Orcat Britain In 18C0 was $J30, 000,000, against $703,000,000 In 1931. The value of tho samo products In tho United States In lbfiO was $185,000,000, against 1348,000,000 In 1SS0. In other words, Great Britain's gains In theso products Ins been 31 per cent., whllo that ot tho Uultel States was 203 per cent. In 1S60 tho value of all manufactures In this country was $1,070,000,000, and In 13S0, $-.500,000,000-tho largest ot anv country In the world. It may ho hero added that this marvelous Increase was to supply tho dem tnds ot our own country. Tho freetraders say that manufacturing has been stimulated by protection to tbe Injury of all other Intcnsti To rcfuto this it Is only ncceistry to give tho figures from the census of tho two periods named. The. value of farms, cattle, crops, and Imple ments In the United States was $9,210, 000,000 In 1SC0, and $15,100,000,000 In 18. Tho value of the crops In the United States In 1SC0 was $915,000,000, aud $J,075,OOd,O0 In 1S0. Infrec-trado England fnim 180 to 1831 tho Ellin bor of acres under tillage decreased frcm 34,073,000 to 23,O?S,O00-a falling oil uf 1,197,000 acres In eleven years Tbcto facts prove that the protective policy which has built up the manufactur ing interests ot the country has also csuscJ the agricultural Interests to thrive, and that a woreo thing than a surplus woull bo the adoption ot the rutrou free Iradu policy advocated by l'ntldent Cleveland and his winters In tho Democratic party. or Courso Wo Will Oi'iMtilrn Ono ot tho organs of Democracy, nc tempting to break the terrible force wltu which tbe cxposuro of tho methods fur suppression of tho vote In Uoorgta 1m struck tho people of the country, says : If tho statistics of Ibo southern congrcsslon l elections that aro now belog priseMed In its publican papers provo anything llko suporcs sion of votes, they prove that, In come dis tricts, tho wicked Democrats la chargo of the pollh'K places and ballot boxes act sally cheated thousands ot their owu politic il brethren out of a chanco to voto. This 1 somewhat awful, but w o can too only ono pas slblo remedy. Let tho Republicans organize, put up candidates, rally tlielr men, and thus luluto interest Into the proceedings sulllclent to call out a full vote. Aud then they will learn that their brother In black Is getting: Into a habit of thinking for himself aud voting with his friends. Tbls effort to meet tho Impression created by tho simple statement ot facts as to the voto in Georgia Is an exceedingly weak and, wo might say, puerile attempt. Tbe Demo crats bavo not suppressed their own votes, but when they know that their conduct and their acts bavo prevented Itepubllcans from voting or from darlog to attempt to vote, It becomes unnecessary for them to call out their forces to the ballot boxes. As for Republican orgiilzatlons, It Is a knouu fact that no such uro permitted, and It Is that fact which Is arousing tho people, of the United States to the Infamous wrongs being committed upon the franchise by theso southern Democrats. We can Inform our contemporary that the Keptibllcans will organize In these states whero the ballot has been suppressed by fraud and violence; they will present can didates; they wilt rally their men; they will Infuse interest Into tho campaign, and when Ibis is dono they will sweep away theso fraudulent Democratic majorities as the cyclone sweeps away a straw lu Its path. A Man for the Tluio. The election to the united States Seuite of Wm. E. Chandler marks an epoch lu New England Itcpubllcuultm. 1'or tomi years previous to lbS7 tho Hepubllcins of some sections suffered from tho nauiby pambylim of Mugwumpcry under thu more attractive name ot Independence, Tbcyhad refused to recognize cuueutes; they had sacrificed leaders at the demand ot tbo pro fessional assassins of character; they had given away advantages through foar ot of fending tha chronic kickers: they were los ing ground all tbo time because they subor dinated their convictions to their tears. The result ot last year's election awak cued tho Itepubllcans of New Hampshire. They renewed their faith with spirit. And who, fn the time ot a political revlvaUIke that, could rally them to pew achievements so well as William E. Chandler? 'lis Is a Republican, twenty-four hours In the day, and he never allows personal differences to divert htm from the support of Republican principles. Tho Republicans remember with pleasure that when bis vigorous methods inspired tho. leadership ot tbe party their victories wero uniform, and de cided, lie encourages men by his aggres siveness, and his keen Intellect will find plenty of work In thoensulog session. Itepubllcans will prosper as long as men like Mr. Chandler are chosen to represent them, and will sutler a rclapso whenever such men aro repelled. They will lead In tho ensuing national campaign. About Jtaw Materials. Wo congratulate tho New York Sim upon tho quickness with which it seizes on a good idea, and tho ability displayed In handling it. Treating upon the' subject of raw.sqaterlals, on, Nov, po, tho.NATiqNAL Republican dosed an artlclo with the fol lowing words I Nothing upon which tho labor of man h'ai been expended Is a raw material. Of course Mr. AbramB, Hewitt will class tho Ironorn, coal, and llmostona which ho wants to uso la his furnace as "raw mateilal," Juvt aa the fcundrymnn elasscs tbo pig Iron which Mr. Hewitt makes in his furnace ai tho "raw ma terial" needed at tho foundry. DuttheAmorlcan lronortt, coal, and llrao s'one each had a brawny"Workwau engaged la taking them from tho canh whllo a capi talist laail bis money invested in tho mines, and these aro as much entitled to protection as Mr. Hewitt'' money and workman, Jtaw material Is a myth, Kg such thing iilsts. The Nsw York Sun of, tbe 8th lnitant, discussing the recommendations ot tbe President for "the reduction of tho duties Imposed on raw materials,1' says: But what aro raw materials? Almost ovcry cno would say that coal, pig iron, copper, load, lumbc r, sail, and sugar should bo so regardod, and so they should bo for some purposes, But In another asocct they aro as much manufac tured goods as tho most olaborato productions of human still. To the miner, who digs ooal from tho ralno, the coal bed is tbe raw mate rial, and coal ready, for burnin? It tho manu factured product. To tho Iron smelter tho oro in raw material and the pigs a manufacture. Trees aro tbd raw material of tbe lumberman, ami logs thoso of tbo sawyer,. Tho tamo may bo tald ofsalt, sugar, and all tho other articles lu tho list. Tbcy arq produced by human la bor and (kill, and can nowberq bu found In naturo ready for consumption. Tho industries connected with the produc tion of so-called. raw,iuatcrlalaarc, therefore, nulte aa Important m any others lu tbe coun try. If tbo men who usa coal, Iron, lumber, and other articles of, that sort aro worthy of consideration by Cpngrcss, so are thoso who producs them, It Is lmpowlbio upon principle IT' i . to d aw any lino which shall Include, ono cls and exclude the other. If we aro to have tui trade for ono set, wo must havo It for all, ntn) lr we protect on , wo must protect all. An? other policy woold bo delusive. The National Hei'Ijdlioan Is truly glal that the New York Sun, "first among IU equate" as an exponent of advance-! thought, has taken tho correct position oi( the question ot raw materials. Tho only raw materials which exist aro thoso which) como from the great alembic of nature prepared by tho wonderful forces which ar continually constructing blades ot gras-v gigantic pines and oaks on too surfaco o tho earth, or down beneath tho surface making coal from theso trees of past nce or iron or copper or gold or sliver by conn blnations unknown to man. When the hand of man touches any o( thcea products ot nature It Is no longer raw material. The Uorllele Despotism. The national Houso of Representatives H supposed to bo a representative body, Thu; purposo of its creation was to giro volca hi tho pcoplo's demands, and no toaro:ent dato tho majority havo been fairly served In Its action. But with tho organization of tbe prefent House begins the third succi clvo term of a despotism which suppresses tho majority, and prevents all legislation except that which is Indorsed by an inslg nlficant minority. Slnco tha election of tho forty-eighth Congress tbo popular dcniiud has been for tho reduction of taxes in such a way at to unburden the people and to prevent tho hc cumulatlnn of a surplus In tho treasury Tho Carlltlo-Morrlson cabal, representing a comparatively small part of tho Industrie) of tbe United States, havo set up a rule oi legislation which Is an organized assault upon American labor and enterprise Through a bare majority of their party In tho llouso they seized upon it orgauli lion, and slnco then tho Democratic mln r Ityandlho whole Republican sldooftn House, together .constituting a large ma Jorlty of tho people's representatives, bitc had no power to originate, legislation una no volco in promoting it, oxqept suah n had the trade mark of the Carll9le-.Morrl-.oi dictators. Tbls majority havo bad to can tent themselves with a defensive policy they have easily defeated the destructive schemes ot tho usurping cabal, but have betn powerless to lcglsl to for tha relief of tho taxpayers. The Instances ot glaring Injustice perpe trated by this usurpation tn Ihe last Con gress will at onco suggest themselves t. thoso who recall Its history. It was n wel known fact that a large majority ot tin House were In favor of an act at oncq re pealing tho tobacco tax law, which would havo relieved the taxpayers and the pro ducers and prevented a further accumula tton In tho treasury of thirty millions an nually. Carlisle and bis .minority refused to rccognlzo any one ot the majority oven to mako a motion to consider It was equally truo that a large majority wero in favor of distributing tho already dangerous surplus for tho benefit ot the people at large. Tbo Senate bill appropri ating money to promote education In the states was stlfind by tho refusal of the Carlisle minority loallow.lts consideration, Examples ot this despotic, rulo were as thick as files In August. Tho oligarchy was as rigid as it was Infamous. It al lowed no latitude tor debate or criticism. It demanded its own specious legislation, and refused all recognition of tbe popular desires. Tbls rulo of the cabal was made possible only by tho treachery of representative-' who were elected to legislate against Car llelclim. The voices of Vlrglnlt, North Catollna, and West Virginia wero emphati cally favorable to moro liberal legislation. They demanded relict from tho interna1 revenue impositions, and tho Blair educa tional bill was of special Interest to them BUt tbe nomination of Carlisle stlencev their appeals. The Democratic nuiuoe from those states swallowed their convlo tlons, and have now cltctod for tbo thlu time an organization pledged to freo trade as a means ot reducing, tho revenue, an i Inimical to all legislation to promoto popu lar Intelligence. So long as constituencies allow them selves to be misrepresented In tbls out regcous manner tht-ro can lie no end ot this ruleot an unprlnclplo 1 minority. Athlr,. ttlal of tbls rule may provoko Inqulrlo among tha people thus treacherously repre sented. Can tbo people who havo. pecu re peatedly cheated quietly submit to auothoi fraud In tbo election of men who dellbcr eratcly misrepresent them ? It Is clear that every man elected as a Democratic protec tionist, from Randall down to tbo smallest neophyte, must come up to tho support of the party machine engineered by tbe Carlisle despotism. It Is cquilly clear that no whole some legislation can emanate from that des potism, and that this condition will exist as long as constituencies v. ho want progressive legislation will submit to be strangled by their representatives, Tboretncdyls simple. It Is to elect representatives who will repre sent. A Reptibllcan, House of Representa tives alone can jestoro that body, to its representative character. Unless ibo ad ministration, awed by tho terrors of an ap proaching, national, campaign, advlso the Carlisle rump, to moderation .and decency tho country mutt- wait for- a Republican Congress, to glvo it relief. Some Truths JfcVoni a iXraoornt. A Democratic congressman from. New York Is reported by the Charleston Jfewi ami C'omiVr.as saying: That whllo there Is no doubt that Prcsidont Cle eland will ogalu bo tbo noraluoo of his party, yet tbore Is no certainty of hit ro-eleo-tlon unless tho. Democratic party Is thoroughly united north, south, oast, aud wost.' Absolute harmony In, New York city, above all things, should bo maintained, for should there ha any trading or dealing with Republican! It might throw th'o tUtOfbaclt Into tbo radlcal)oo A change of a. few hundred votes la Florida might turn that staio over to tho enemy, as there is less than one tboutand votes difference between tbo two patties at present. Ho saia. there aro. also twa,dr threo other southern states, but ho doca, not name them, ,tbat need watching next fear, and, therefore, it will not do, for lhe Denaocaljp parly to relax their vlglianje, or place too much depondonce oulho excellent record made py.tkapresont administration. It is well enough to go into battio confident of victory, but without Jull clous action by tbo party leaders in Congress and eggrassivo work at tho polls. President Cleveland's reelection tt by no means as sured, ,TbQ Republicans have bsen quietly at work all tho summer batching tbulr plans for tbocoratngeeisloiofCongrfiss, and thoy will mako a desperato fight to outgonoral tho friends or the administration in matters of legislation, and, falling In that, they will use ct cry means known and unknown lu political warfaro tojoyorthrow thu pasty rlu power at the next election. Ho adjltss liii D jtnocratl l brethren to stand together on tho tarllf aud allothcr questions of national Importance, and present an unbroken front totboonomy when tbo bsttlo begins. Tho congressman Is correct .Inmost of what he says, and particularly right as to the "two or three qther soiithef u, stoics." Ills modesty, a thing for wklchiNovn York congressmen are especially noted, kept htm from naming tbo, states, but lie, doubtless meant Virginia, Wast Virginia, North Caro lina, feflucisce', and Maryland, thrco.pf which are reasonably certain to'co Into tbe Republican column, with tbo other two leaning that way strongly, As to New York: every. Indication points to ilia pploton that It will ho tb.rpwa."t)ick Into Hie Radical line." Tne Republicans, aro recovering their old time aggressive', nets. They are standing up for principle vital to tbe proap-fily and fnturn of tlnj eountry.and appealing to tho voters la thttl Way will secure thu majority. As for Judlcous action on the pirtof the Democrats in Congress, that ' not to '' expected, unless tho new congressman ,ira great Improvement on their predecessors, Tho "excellent rocord made by too pres ent administration" lsot course a plca oil mild sarcasm. It It wero possslWo for Cou Kress tondjourn alter simply passing tbo appropriation hills tho Ropublicanj would bo well pleated to mako the next campaign on tho "record of the present admlnlstra' tlon," exccllont as the Now Yorker may claim it to bo. Tho policy of contraction which roduoes' tho farm values of throo of. tho loading food products of thocouutry wheat, corn, and oat tho enormous sum ot $3J0,O0J, 000, as compared with tho same quantities ot theso products under Ropubllcan rule. Tho Republicans want no .potter Isauo thin that partot tho administration's record. Then they would possibly havo some thing to say about tho b.ittlo flags iboat tbo veto ot pension bills about tho Ina bility to deal with surplus about tho failure to remove tho infamous ox lotions from tho pcoplo la tbe continuation of tbo Internal revenue tax on tobacco. By all, means lot us havo a canvass on the "excellent record mado by tbo present ad ministration." That Is what tbo Republi cans want. A Well Defined Issue. Mr. Ilenry I.ahoucherC, tho ablo editor ot London Truth, says that tho tariff Is a local issue, as Gen. Hancock esld In his letter ot acceptance ot tho Democratic nomination. But Mr. Labouchcreglvcslta broader sense than was Implied In that letter. Ho says; I nm no fanatical freo trader; I nm ono geo graphically, If I had been an American 1 should havo been a protectionist. Being an Englishman I am a freo trader. If I wero a' Canadian I shonld advocato a customs union Willi tbo United Slates, although, as aq Jl'ig lltbtnan, I should bo sorry II tbls union wero effected. Tbo mlstako of political economy Is to suppose that It Is based on principles of uni versal application. My reason, as an Eogllsh man, for being a freo trader Is not any thoorotl cal admiration or freo trade, bat h?causo wo should lose moro tbau wo should gain by pro tection. Tho editor of i"ni(i may bo correct; pos sibly Is, as to tho necessity ot, an Eogllsh man being a freo trader. Ho ts ccrtainlv correct in tho assertion that an American should bo a protectionist. It Is tho duty of the American pcoplo, as a people, to pro tect their trade against tho Incursions of freetraders. Unfortunately thcro are somo men In America who either havo not the ability or tho inclination to comprehend the great principles which underlie tho protect ive policy of the Republican party. Hence ii hi i I " bccomct necessary that thoso who do un luo subject uetun'i luo ,uhjcct should placo it bofpro tho public In a proper light. Protection Is tha great safeguard ot American interests and of American work lngmen. Without It capital .would be destroyed; jabor would bo reduced to serf dom. -These aro facts whlchvft la tho duty ot tho Republican cress snd the Republlcau speakers to impress upon tho mind ot thu Amerlcau.vottr. Tbo weak platitudes of President Cleveland and ot other Ameri cans llko him, who are laboring tn tho Interest of English free traders, whether corruptly or beoaise ot tha want of knowledge, can easily bq, refuted, and It Is , to that ttttl; that 'the Republican press should devote Itself during tho Coming campaign. Clovelandlsiu tn-Itelapso Enough time has elapsed since the publi cation of tbo ofilclal returns of tho N'ew York elections to havo exhaustol a supe rior selection of fireworks over tho antljl pated re-election ot Mr. Cleveland. But the fireworks are not forthcoming and the boomers aro not booming. Something has dampened tho ro-clectlon, powder, and tne display Is indefinitely postponed. Thcro was a promise ot more than 23, 000 plurality tor the Dcuiicratto ticket. It has dwindled. Tbe head ot the tSfite' leads with less than 17,009, and the Othm candidates lag with various figures down to 13,000. The averago Is less than tho Demo cratic plurality tho yoar previous to thu Burchard achievement la electing Cleve land by a meager 1,100. Even tbls meager outcome ot an oloctlon Into which was thrown tbo.whole power of the national administration, tho state a I ministration, the New York city alralul tratlon In person, by letter, and by chock was procured by means which nppeirto rob It of its first charms as received by tele graph at tbe white bouse. The head ot tbe Democratic ticket Is a brewer. In the brewery districts ho ran several thousand votes ahead of bis associates; but through bis Intluence and that of tbo chairman of tbe state committee, also a liquor manu facturer, a groat fund was raised, which helped tbo freo whisky ticket as a whole. Add to tbls tho fact, stated by one , Demo cratio authority, that the running ot a re form and. a boode,Democratlc candidate f or attorney In tbe city added 5,039 .votes to tbe Democratic., column; and. ,that the boodle aldermen with their henchmen stood by the administration tn the 0ght,and,tbp real Democratic plurality seems tp .repre sent.very little in tbo re election. 'campion. Tbc6pAfftit8, and tfigures havo set the soberer Democrats, to thinking.', i'ho Bos ton O&t'o and the. New York World tapir tlcular havo turned their efforts to warning tbetr brethren not to bo content with re electing Cleveland tbls year and letting next year go by default. Tho HViM shows how mucb.more prosperous tbe Democratic party was in 1$S3 than now. ."Contucky," It 6ays,r'was Democratic by over1 4,4,000 majority, .Maryland by 12,000, and Missis sippi ,by, an pvcrwholmlng vote. Virginia bad revolutionized the stato legislature to a Democratic majoilty ot twenty. West 'lr-' gtnla had elected Suyder, Democrat, to fill a vacancy In Congress by a good majority. The IJemocrats hti carried N,ew York by 17,000 pluralltyp'New Jersey by 0,800 plu rality. Indiana stood Inline with n Demo cratic governor-elect and a Democratic leg islature." On tho other hand, the Ropub-. Ilcans bad lost Michigan and Ohio, and their! "majorities in other, states had dwindled down to moderate pluralities." Tho World contrasts the' condition otiatfaira then and' now, preceding another presidential coqtostj "Tbe Republicans have tbls 'year renewed' their strength la their own states and rqade Inroads. In. some of tbe Democratic states,") it continues, ' whllo tho Democrats Ohavo! lost New Jersey and Indiana," Its con-j elusion is tbatf'tho Democrats pan hardly' expect to'tylpnext year d single Republican) state which voted tor Mr, Blalna in'lS31, and that; tho. voto of this state along can' seeure a Democratic vlctpry," and It Is notj apparently , happy at the prospect evn In New York, for It tels tho Democratic .man agers "there Is no margin for blunders," This Democratic, cerspectlvo of Democ racy is sad. Yet H does not Include all tho sad features. Outsldoof New York;.clty, New York ptato Is more strongly Republi can than it was in 1883 by enough to over come double, tbo lato Democratic plurality.

The President should have followed out this lino of alleged reasoning. For exam ple, tho message should havo re corded that tha farmer who ralsos potatoes Is mulcted by tbo duties on bis tools to such an extont that his ".tariff profit" is "swept away," Reason it out In this wise : Tho farmer purchases a plow, a (hovel, a hoe, and other tools to tho value or $50. Tho so-called "tariff profit" paid on theso perhaps would bo $15. With these tools ho can raise at. least 3,000 bush els of potatoes. It, as tho Prosldont asserts, tbo price Is raised to Just tho extent of tho duty, his "tariff profit" above tho free trade profit would be 15 cents per hushol, or $300. .Ilow.a "tariff profit" of $300 can ho "swept awayt' by a tariff expenditure ot $15 wo can safely leave tho President to answer. Tbls presidential Cobdcn Club sophistry1 relativo to other Interests might be as easily laughed down, but It is a waste of time It Is not. true, as tho President assumes, that tbo prices of nil commodities are en hanced by Just so much as tbo amount of tariff duties imposed. Tho articles which tbe fatmcr purchases aro all from tun to sixty per cent, cheaper now than Ibey wero under a free- trade policy. Tho farmer Is actually beneflted by tho duties upon manufactured goods by, reason of tho encouragement thoy give to competition, Mr. Randal) should -give the President lessons in tho intermediate grade ot politi cal economy. Tho, primary, courso Is in adequate. ' Don M. Dickinson Is mad bcciuso a' Chicago newspaper says his father was born an Englishman.

The Pres ident runs through tbe gamut ot tbo pro tective argument and exposes with cruel courtesy' its every fallacy.

Tbe Issue Is now fairly Joined, Philadelphia Daily Nan: Abuse Is not argument, and tho only arguments pre sented by thoProsldcntln his messige,aro based on Ignorance and au Inadequate com--prehension ot the dialing stato ot afftlrs, " As a campaign document for, tho free traders the President's message will bo excellent; but we doubt If it will ho satis factory even to bis psrty.

Philadelphia Ledger) It Is only a day or two since that It was tho duty of tbe Ledger tossy that tho Democratic party occupied tbo position of advantage In tho matter ot tho approaching presidential election, and about tho best outlook for tbe Republicans was that tbe Democrats, bocauso ot their fatal facility for making mischief for thorn-' selves, might destroy their ndvintago be tween now and tbo election. That seems to bo the work they are pursuing with great diligence at this time. "Oh, that mine adversary had written a book." Mr. Cleveland has written the hook for them.

Tho peoplo of this country have longod for such a manifestation of Jacksonlan back bono in tbo white houso. Wo think this courageous stato paper will satisfy their longing. The key note of 1833 has boon sounded. Philadelphia Inquirer: lie has laid down tbe platform on which tho campaign of 1S88 will b6 fought. Ilehss given us tho freshest, best argued, and most Important luniL paper mat uas appearcu. inr many years. Despite his deprecation of free irado sentiments, protectionists will rccog, nlzo it as tbo most subtile argument against tbo protective tariff within tho memory of the present generation. It will put the Re publican psrty on tbe defensive unless Its' representatives In Congress shall be wise enough and prompt enough to offer a modified tariff bill before tho Democrats can prepare a slightly disguised freo trade enactment. It nominates Grover Cleveland for President in 1SSS. New York Star: Wo greatly doubt whether tbls strong and patriotic appeal will produce the effect to which it Is enti tled. Tho protected Interests havo hither to failed to show any disposition toyiold to any impulse wbatevcrexcept their own selfishness. They havo .stood banded to gether against any chango which might ro ducetbo profits they extort from tbe toll ing masses. They havo refused to glvo up tho tax upon lumber, which has despoiled our forests, or upon salt, .which Is, neces sary to tho preservation of food, or on fuel, without which no, labor can be per formed. All these taxes aro admitted tn lm ,cruel,and "unnecessary. ,They ho,vo been ,contlcucd merely because tho .conspiracy euum nob ue,muintaiutu except uy couceit.

As to the va6t Interests ot tho Interior workings 'of tho covernmoat, the .Internal revenue, pensions, Indian affairs, postal matters, foreign relations, and tbo all Important (to New England) question of tho fisheries he has not a word, Mr. Cleveland has sunk tho President into tho partisan to a remarkable dogroo. Louisville CourioJounial: "Two classes aro likely to find the messagoa very trouble some paner. Tho first embraces the ltennb. Ilcans. who aro already denouncing It aa a sfreo trade. The second consists of those -democrats wuo bavo persisted In believing that they could defeat tbo movement for revenue reform by obstruction , devices, and who to tbls end have sought to muddle tho question In tho public mind by the ceaseless mlsrenrtsontloir of the nurooses nf t.tin .filends of reform.

New York Timet: Mr. Cloveland has dono an act of plutmuanshlp Inthobost senso. Recognizing a groat duty bo has performed It with tourogo, with firmness, and at the right tlmo. And ho has per formed It so that every honest man must sea that it is an bonost act, disinterested, faithful to tho requirements of conscience, without bono or purposo of personal or pstly odvsntagi! e xcipt tuch as comes front the public recognition of tmblla sorvlce. Judged by any otdlbary standard of polit ical expediency Hie Piesldent'aact is Inex pedient. Hobos fiucod upon his party an Issue as to which the party Is divided, and so divided that unlts tho minority yield, It can defeat the will of tho majority. Ho has dono this on the evo of a national contest, In which a considerable number ot men ot Influence In the party have boon urging blm to avoid this Issue, and threatening hint und tbo party with disaster Ifhodld not nvcl'llt. On tho other hand, thero Is nothing in tbls issuo, thus pre sented, by which Mr. Cleveland could hope to draw from tho Republican party any votes to compensate thoso be Is in danger of losing and which bo has been warned over and again b loaders of his own party that he would lotn. Not this nlono, for If tha protectionist faction In tho Democratic psrty carry out tbclr own desires, or da what tbey have continually declared that they would do, Mr. Cloveland has done tho ono thing by which ho could Imperil tho prospect ot his own rcnomlnatlon. From the point of vlowot tbo politician, ho has. shown a couragx that Is temerity in tho pur suit of an end of no value to himself. Philadelphia Times: When It la conald. ercd that President Cloveland keeps so dis tinctly In view tho maintenance of our manufactures and tho labor employed therein, all assumption ot free trado theory or purpose perishes from tbo minds ot tbo American people; and when it Is further considered that the reduction of protective duties proposed by him would not go below the standard ot protection fixed by tho dls tlLctlvcly Republican protcctlvo tariff ot 1801, known as tho Morrill tariff act, tho people will better understand what Is meant by tariff reduction to rcduco tho revenues. In point of fact, any reduction of duties In Industries which are In compe tition with foreign Industries, holow the standard of full ptotcctlonto both capital and labor, would incroaso rather than reduco tho revenues on those ar ticles. Thus when tho prlnclplo of malntBl ting our manufacturing industries is recognized, tariff revision to reduco rovo nue must maintain tho standard of actual protection to avoid increased rovenuo. Tho chltf obstacle to wlso tariff revision is In tbe fact that the necessities of war com pelled largely Increased duties on many manufactured articles, and manufacturers are reluctant to assent to any reduction from war, taxes. Thu fact that many arti cles ot homo necessity could and would bo produced cheaper than they aro now fur nished to consumers Is shown In tbo pointed reference ot tbo President to tho rsnldlv .multiplying trusts or combinations which are wier-ucu to maintain oroirrarv anu ex tortionate prices to consumers. Tariff re vision Is called for that will not only pro tect manufacturers In their legitlmati profits, but at the same time largely ro duce the present cost ot articles which aro common necessities of tho people.
