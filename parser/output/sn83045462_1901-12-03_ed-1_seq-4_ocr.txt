THE EVENING STAR. WASHINGTON. TUESDAY .......... December 3, 1901. CROSBY S. NOYES ............ Editor. THE EVENING STAR has a regular and permament Famfly Ciselation much m1ore than the combined e1-. culation of the other Waehlugton daillies. As a News nd Advertising Medium it has no competitor. gri order to avoid. delays on ae eount of personal absenee, letters to THE STAR should not he addressed to any Individual connected with the O0ee. but simply to THE STAR, or to the Editorial or Business Depart meats., according to temor or purpose. The Mensage. The fear expressed that the President's message would be' too long was idle. It is safe to say that no man will count the words, but that every one who takes it up till read it through with relish. From the first paragraph, with its tender tribute to the mem iry of Mr. McKinley, to the last, with its earnest expression of appreciation of the foreign sympathy offered to the na tin in its hour of sorrow, the paper is one of individuality and of interest. It leaves no important question untouched, and it discourses of none in any obscure or halt ing fashion. The man of opinions gives his opinions in clear and concise style.- and so as to impress upon the reader the belief in the author's absolute sincerity. A trained writer and thinker holds the pen, and he holds it very firmly. Congress, at any rate, cannot complain. because the constitu tional requirement that the President shall from time to time make suggestions to that body with relation to the state of public business and the public welfare was never more completely complied with. Here are suggestions enough to last the session. And all of them are good. Lucky will the coun try b if even the half of them are fol lowed. The President's arrangement of his topics puts the question of the anarchists first, There Is no more important question, and Congress should deal with it in some effec tive form. Nor will it suffice simply to suppress the fiends who are now harboring in this country and openly boasting of their views and publicly rejoicing when some ruler is assassinated by one of their num ber. Our immigration laws are, and for some years have been, sadly in need of overhauling, with the view of keeping out of the I'nited States people without the ability or the desire to take up and dis charge the burdens of good citizenship. And, appropriately enough, the President clises the paragraph with an appeal for the renewal of the Chinese exclusion act. The paragraph with regard to the tariff and reciprocity, while strictly in line with Mr. McKinley's Buffalo speech. cannot be set down as the offspring of that. It will be recalled that Mr. Roosevelt, then the Vice President. spoke at Minneapolis sever al days before Mr. McKinley did at Buffalo. and in much the same strain as to our in dustries and foreign markets. The two men. without a conference. were thinking along the same lines and to the same ends. Both were protectionists. Both stood to their protection guns. But both urged a logical application of the policy to the new times and conditions. Mr. Roosevelt, in biblicai phrase. calls reciprocity "the hand maidn of protection"-a very just and happy characterization. And it will not be overlooked that Mr. Roosevelt agrees with his predecessor in the opinion that there are some of our Industries which no longer need protection, and that it would be wise and right to shift the favors now bestowea upon them to more deserving objects. or use them in making terms of trade with other mations. And for the reciprocity treaties now before the Senate he asks considera tio.-n. The President speaks for peace, but of c-urse upon the only line which Insures peace. We must get, and stay, good and ready for war. The navy must take rank with the best. We must have ships of the most approved pattern. and men enough, and to spare, thoroughly drilled for fight ing them. We won against Spain because we were ready on the sea: and we must be prepared there at all times and against all lpssible comers. The army, too, should be kept smart and fit. Whatever is necessary to the maintenance of a system working for the production of capable offiers and hardy men should be wllingly and abun dant'y supplied. Surely the west will like this message. Her wants are remembered in the warm est terms. No other President has ever sp.'ken at such length or so explicitly on the subject o)f irrigation. It is probably true, to,. that nto other President evet had so wide an acquaintance with the subject as Mr. Rtoosevelt possesses. He is, as it were. an adopted child of the west, and knows her wants and sympathizes with them. In the far east, in early times, the man who digged a well was listed as a public bene faotor. His name was recorded with honor. And it is safe to say that if Mr. Roosevelt can induce Congress to lay the foundation for reservoirs which will husband for the great empire beyond the Mississippi the water necessary to add the desert reaches there to habitation anu productivity he need lose no sleep about the enduring quality of his fame. The main argument which some Ameri cans advance against the re-enactment of the ('hinese exclusion law is that it does not exclude. If this be true, Minister Wu Ting Fang and Consul General Yo How hav thughtlessiy permitted themselves to be. m- ,xited. Those gentlemen who de chire that the exclusion law is a nullity, are wrong. The fact that the law Is violated d.>-s no.t prove their case. The Ten Comn maindmenits are violated, but the Christian world wil not repeal them because of this fact. The. faat that few Congresses succeed in beig as gil as sonme of the messages they get fortuintly does not exercise any influ erce on the men whose duty it becomes to 1-reisare the documentM President Castro proceeds on the theory that the first duty of a government is to collect a war tax. Thse P'resident on Distriet Nieeds. The President's references to the District of Culumbia, In the course of his message, are few but pointed. He recommends the enactment of a. local factory law, the en lirgement o-f the habited alleys into minor streets and the extension of the civil ser vice law to the District government. It is natural that he should wish to see the fed eral capital given the benefit of the best possible laws. He pleads in his message in general for a closer study of the welfare of the wage-workers, as contributing to the solution of many of the social problems which now await remedial attention. Among the needs of this clams is more careful legislation to prevent injustice and barsh treatment and to permit the working class to better Itself mentally and physi-. eally. The District has no specific factory Jaws, and despite the general excellence of industrial conditions here tber, is room for Improvement, especially in the light of the contempiated increase In the manufac tigring Interests of the District. A well eesid~ered fatory law enacted now will perhaps prevent the growh of serious corn ditionm later. when adationl industries have been estahinaha here and give em ptorysent to large numbers et people. Along the -am line of seini bettment is the Prestent's 1 n=madte tat the shm as 'the ct. comnetssi witin the thickly populated alleys, be converted Into mdnor streets and given the benedt of the pabIlic improvements pertaining to -much thoroughfsres. Mdi has already been done in Washington toward the regenea tion of the alleys. Model tenements have been built through the enterprise of public spirited citinens, and have shown the way to the solution of some of the sanitary and moral problems which beset the worker among. the poorer classes. But much more remains to be done. in the direction of the President's suggestion, and an enactment on this subject will materially faolitate the transformation of the slums of the cap ital into places of reasonably .wholesome residence. The recommendation as to the civil ser vice law is the most important of all those affecting the District. It is the first time a President has thus specifically urged that the local government be given the benefit of the system which maintains the merit pr4nolple In the general departmental service. Commissioners of the District have uniformly urged this measure of good gov ernment for a number of years, pointing to the success scored by the merit system In the federal departments, and empha sizing the non-partisan nature of the'local administration. Failing to secure such an extension of the law they have in a oertain measure set up a civil service system of their own, which works fairly well, con sidering the handicap of political pressure to which they are continually subject. The direct Inclusion of the District govern ment within the scope of the civil service commission, by either specific act or by presidential order, authorized by statute, will greatly relieve the Commissioners from embarrassmert in the selection of their subordinates and facilitate the transaction of the municipal business. The Commissioners' Report. The District Commissioners' annual re port places the needs of the capital before Congress In such a manner that the case may be broadly considered in the light of the actual necessities as well as in view of Secretary Gage's formal reminder that the District is in debt to the federal gov ernment and his perfunctory recommenda tion that the appropriations be cut below the estimates. The Secretary in thus call ing the attention of Congress to the need of further legislation to meet the existing and prospective conditions states the case from the point of view of bare statistics. The Commisioners' report shows on the other hand that the sums named in the estimates are necessary for the mainte nance of the federal capital upon an appro priate plane of municipal efficiency. It has been brought to its present level as a model city largely through wise expenditures in the past. Despite the rapidity with which the annual appropriations have of late been Increased there yet remain many important projects reqdiring attention, and the Dis trict stands ready to assume Its rightful share of the cost if Congress will but so order. More schools, more sewers, more police men, more firemen, more Inspectors for the preservation of the public health, more public servants in almost every depart ment to ensure reliable results in adminis tration-these necessities are clearly dem onstrated by the Commissioners. Their re port of the year's progress evidences the requirements of the year to come. They point to a community well governed, with great care taken to ensure health and pros perity, safety and comfort. They disclose high standards of efficiency maintained In the municipal service. They express the reasonable hope that Congress will not now take a retrograde step. The sole reason alleged for curtailing the budget is that the District owes noney to the federal government, and that its reve nues are mortgaged to pay such heavy ex penditures wholly out of Its own resources that it is impossible to meet the estimates. The District Is not responsible for this con dition, and it should not be made to suffer because of It, as The Star suggested yesterday. The Commissioners' report is wisely couched in a spirit of confidence that the justice of this proposition will be recog nized by the houses. The Commissioners urge the construction of the Memorial bridge and of a national me morial to the late President In this city, the improvement of the Anacostia river, the construction of a worthy official home for the District government, the proper main tenance of the Public Library In view of its approaching occupancy of the new building provided by Mr. Carnegie, the es tablishment of a high pressure water ser vice for fire fighting, the enactment of addi tional laws to regulate the sale of milk, and various other changes in the laws to permit a greater degree of eficiency in the public service. This report bespeaks with confidence a ccntinuation of congressional consideration for and interest in the development of an Ideal municipality, such as Washington is rapidly becoming. Although this is the long session of Con gress no attempt will be made to deliver all those speeches which would appear to have been delivered. The leave to print will do business at the old stand and the Record will continue to be the refuge of gentlemen with weak lungs, shy nerves, sore throats and hoapseness. If the rule of "leave to print" could be so enforced as to strike a balance between the silent and the clamorous orators the effect would be pleasing. But the silent speaker will per sist in committing pious frauds upon his constituents and the vociferous gentleman will continue his efforts to produce rain with vocal bombs. The Boers are pegging away with a per sistency which would indicate that they are not allowing themselves to depend very far on the expressions of sympathy once so nu merous in this country. No man worthy of the office would refuse the presidency because of the physical danger that might be attached to It. But this fact Is no excuse for a laxity in sup pressing anarchism. There Is some disposition to throw diffi culties in the way of the picturesque, Cin emnnatus, -want-you-my-honey features of Mr. Gorman's return to the Senate. Mr. Bryan takes cheer from the fact that a man never gets over being a more or less remote presidential possibility, so long as he has his health. Sixto Lope. is wandering about lUke a "me too" politician who- has slipped his moorings and lost the important part of the combination. Some rising oriental statesman may come Into possession of the yellow jacket. But he will hardly fill Li Hung Changs shoes, Imsular AaAwes The decision of the Suapreme Court as to the status of the Philippines clears the way for action by Congress along the line of the President's recommenatioa to legis late for the Philippines. The mes=sage be speaks consideration for the welfare of the Wsand. through the developinent' of their resources. The court's decision points toE the need orat least the wisdom of specific legislation preiing for the cellecsa a revenues through carefully formulated tap, tIf schedules. Thus the case ssuhes asrw aspect, and the house.shebuld regarti it s of paeasmeunt Importhnee in' .the sessiha The court declares thpt the leaer act is valid in'e @5ts aspects.

Whereas it may be passible that the Premant or the Phiipplnes commisiot now has authority under the Spooner amendment to conect tariff duties upon importations from the United States for the maintenane of the Insular *aministration, which would with stand .the scrutiny of the pupreme Court. yet it is the short cut to absolute cer tainty to follow the example set in the case of Porto Rico. Then there would be no room for the litigious exporter or importer t3 stand before the court and embarrass the Insular administration. The President's recommendations as to the islands relate specifically to the enact ment of laws for the development of their resources, through the grant of franchises for a term of years. He is careful thus to restrict the proposition. He evidently fore sees the dangers in the wide opening of the doors to exploiting corporations. He wants the Islands developed for the sake, pri marily, of the inhabitants. Yet the In vestor will not go there without an Induce ment and Congress should at this session provide a reasonable course of legislation which will encourage investments in the Islands for the sake of the upbuilding of industries there and the consequent pros perity of the natives. It is to be assumed that as far as possible Congress will take care of the American interests in the fram ing of the necessary statutes. The Emperor of Germany had six nons before his heart was gladdened with a daughter, and the fortune teller who proph esied that such would be the case now says that the Czar of Russia will have six daughters before there is an heir. It is lucky that the fortune teller is not a Rus sian citizen or there would be another through ticket to Siberia issued right away. It Is said in railroad circles that if the northwestern legislatures continue to throw themselves upon the railroad tracks' coro ners will demand an increase in salary and the; price of burial sites will rise. Representative Littlefield, In introducing two anti-trust bills on the first day of the Fifty-seventh Congress, took the earliest opportunity to Inform the Octopus of his return to Washington. Edward M. Shepard appears as a rival of Arthur P. Gorman for the role of demo cratic Moses. Mr. Shepard did not win. Neither did Mr. Gorman; he just got there without winning. A tramp was arrested In Chicago for sleeping In a church. Possibly some of the regular members of the congregation have inadvertently been- guilty of a simi lar offense. If T. Plerpont Morgan was traveling In Europe now he might be seized with an impulse to buy Miss Stone's release as a comparatively inexpensive incidental. From the appearance of the news and edi torial pages of American newspapers today one may easily be convinced that Washing ton is the only city on the map. I I Ir The people of Wantage have not risen to protest against the rumor that Richard Croker may prolong his visit to America. Sir Thomas Lipton says he will try again1 but reserves his remarks about having a winning boat.for the near future. The average prize fighter is as haughtl 4s if defeat, sooner or later, were not ai absolute certainty. Richard Croker has money enough to hir biographies written until he gets one that suits him. The man with a bill which combines profit with patriotism is on hand as. usual today. Yellow butterine is another form In which the yellow peril threatens. The day dawned as clear as a Supreme Court decision.
