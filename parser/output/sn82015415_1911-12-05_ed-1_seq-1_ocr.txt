Hp m m mm Tijr 1 I I 10 A 1 i GET TR TO CAR IM It has been suggested that there may be a possibility of the Territory getting the use of a United States transport that is laid up, for the work of bringing Immigrants to Hawaii from Europe. A prominent citizen said this morning: "I hoar that often a transport is laid up for a long stretch of time. Now could not the Territory come to terms with the federal authorities, and ar range to charter the steamer?. Not only could immigrants be brought out from Europe, but large cargoes of pineapples could be sent to the old I Land Commissioner Judd announced this morning that the Board of Agri culture is working on n scheme to in itiate regulations that will tend to keep banana plantations free from scale, blight and injurious Insects. Tho rules and regulations will help 'out a' lot in tho matter of keeping down insects that are or are likely to becomo injurious to tho plants. The object aimed at is to get authority to proceed in the matter, and also to ad viso peoplo what to do In case the scale or some other blight appears in their orchards. The board will also, through the government veterinarian, formulate nnd adopt rules regarding a quaran tine against Imported dogs. It is al leged that there is a lot of rabies on the mainland at present, and that all dogs coming into Hawaii should bo placed in quarantine for at least nine ty days. The question of quarantining dogs will be threshed out and then a draft of the proposed regulations will be submitted to the committee on animal industry. No further word has been received from the Callforian authorities with reference to "the fruit fly campaign. It was thought that the now commis sioner would write by the last mail. As far as was known this morning Ihe U. S. S. Maryland will leave to morrow for Hilo, lu order to 'enable the sailors to see the volcano. Each vessel will leave in turn. The program i has not yet been definitely drawn up, but it is certain that the boats will go to Hilo, starting with tho Maryland tomorrow. The Idea now is to despatch tho ships one at a timo, giving each ves sel about live da,ys there. The flag ship California will bo about the fourth to leavo here, and is expected back by December 23, thus enabling the offi cers and men to spend Christinas Day here. Arrangements nro now being mado to allow tho marines to go Into camp. Tho mnrlnes will be stripped from all the ships, leaving none at all on board, sailors being assigned to all the duties usually carried on by the marines. Perhaps n change may bo mado by tho officers to enable them to retain somo marines ns ordorllos. The meu will bo encamped at Pearl Ilarbor, negotiations now going on to obtain the uso of the necessary laud at Bis hop Point us a site ..for the camp. To day some time it Is anticipated the ' nocesBary transportation will be ar ranged. This morning the flagship Califor QUARANTINE AGA1NS RABIES Maryland Goes First On the Volcano Trip ANSP0RT RY OUR M GRANTS world from here. Europe will take large quantities of canned pines, and thero is a huge market there." The Immigrant steamer Willesden Is still tied up nt the quarantine wharf. Tho Immigrants are being landed in batches, after fumigation. They will be well looked after on Quarantine Island, and when discharg ed from there will go over to the Im migration, headquarters, there to bo examined by Raymond C. Brown. Aft er liat proceeding is finished, the im migrants will be housed and sheltered at the old flshmarkct, which has been turned into a first-class place for such a purpose. It Is possible that certain "groups" of immigrants, who hnve not come In contact with the sick people, and who have passed the number of required days in quarantine, will be examined by Mr. Brown and nllowed to sail for the plantations, A death o:curred among the Willes den's passengers yesterday, a child passing away from some undetermined disease. Other cases of smallpox have developed, but the doctors hope to keep the number down from now on. PLANTERS VARIOU This morning the Hawaiian bugar Planters' Association discussed, most ly in conversational manner, two of the committee reports of which sum maries are printed elsewhere, and this afternoon they will discuss anothor report, that on machinery. Upon the manufacturing of sugar and utilization of by-products tho de bate resulted In no definite conclus ions, and tho remarks wero generally rather casual and desultory. Thero Is therefore no answer as yet to the al cohol and molasses problems revived by the committee. There was more c.nlniutlon in the discussion of cutting, loading and transportation, in which George F. Benton and Andrew Adams took lead ing parts. Much interest was taken In the suggestion of the uso of gasoline trucks. P. C. Jones, on tho question of burn ing tho cane boforcutttng, stated nia finished up coaling, having taken on about 1500 tons. The South Dako ta is also finished up now, and only the West Virginia remains to bo coal ed. The Colorado and the Maryland are outside at anchor. The Colorado wilt leave tomorrow, and her anchor age will be taken up by the South Dakota, thus leaving only tho flagship and tho West Virginia In port. It Is bolioved that only tho flagship will remain at the wharf, the other vessels being sent to anchor outside. It is stuted that sailors prefer their vessels to ho anchored to being moor ed to the wharves, us they can keep their boats cleaner whllo at anchor .than they can at scu. This morning the sailors from tho West Virginia spent a lot of time drill ing at tho foot . of Fort street, and naturally their work created a great deal of interest. No official announcements have been received by tho fleet concerning tho results of tho target practice. Governor Will Entertain. Governor Frear will entertain tho admirals and captains with nn auto mobile party, during ho weok. A run will bo mado to Halelwa, whore lunch will bo sorved. Later on a luau is to bo tendered tho visitors at Pearl Harbor. So far no definite announcements have been made In regard to this. tranter of NACdDbTTH Henry Young, a passenger arriving by tho S. S. Sierra last Friday, was the same evening drugged and robbed of. $300. Young was having a good time round town on Fiidny and in the even ing was driven by a hackmnn on the Bethel street stand to Iwilel. On leaving the latter district to re turn to town several sailors in uni form Jumped into thj hack and accom panied Young up town. j The lights went out for him then and when he' came to about 11 a. ni. he was In the Manhnttan restaurant on Hotel street, overy cent In his clothes gono and even his cuff links and tie pin having been taken away, t He has been 111 ever since, and ISj certain that he was. drugged and robbed, though ho has no Idea by whom, j Young had In his pockets five $50 . hills, one $20 1)111. two $10 bills and! CUSS IEP0RTS that the method was tried at Pahala as far back as 1S80, but the manager at that .time was greatly opposed to it because he believed everything pos sible ought to go back into the soil. In those days, It was pointed out, tho plantations cannot successfully dispose of all the waste material in the soil. Therefore, tho refuse 1 to be burned anyway after If not bo lero cutting. IN STREAM At 12:4S ii. m. tho body of a 'Japan eso boy, six years of age, was' taken from Nuuanu stream near''' Hotel street. The body was takon to u Japanese store in tho vicinity ami has since been moved to tho morgue. No further details are forthcoming nt present. E A load of coal was delayed for a long timo this morning by an assist ant hack Inspector refusing to allow the driver to proceed, as tho horse hud a soro leg. Tho inspector said that lie was thero to see that no animals wore al lowed to pass him if they were af fected in any way, and ho was going to do his duty. A big man covered with coal dust tried to point out to tho hnckmnn that tho horso was all right, but tho inspector preferred to take his own opinion. Bill Lursen nnd Tommy Dunn Joined tho crowd. Larson explained that it was a shoe boil tbat tho horse was suffering from, nnd that tho holo there was caused ,by an operation. Dunn told tho hack Inspector how serious it was tp interfere with the work of tho United States. None of which moved the Inspector. A lot ot talk took place, and ovontunlly tho horso was removed and anothor put Into tho shafts. The off foreleg of tho horse had a horri ble soro on it nnd, without any scien tific knowledge being brought to bear, it would Boom that tho inspector did only his duty In refusing to permit tho horso to bo worked any further. ears SORELEGGED Some some small change. Tho $."i and $20 hills were in a red pocket book in his inside coat pocket. The $10 bill and the change he carried In IiIh trousor pockets. Took Links and Pin. His links wero silver and abalonc, and tho missing stick pin is a cameo of a woman's face set in Indian gold. Young asserts .that a soldier In uni form was with him during the after noon and evening and that they had several drinks together. Ho says that this man was continually meeting him ami that he didn't seem to bo able to get rid of him. Chief or Detectives .Mr Unfile is in vestigating tho matter. Young intends to leave Honolulu by the S. S. Mnruma tomorrow. Has Great Discovery. He Is a mining engineer b profes sion and is the Inventor of a method of preventing the corrosion and de composition of metal. When he left Australia some timo T DP I ii "More homesteads have been taken up by Americans than most people imagine," remarked Governor Frear this morning. "Tho homesteads are not all on the hills either, although somo of thorn arc above the cane land belt. Tho land taken up at Wnhlawn, Haiku and other places is good enough for anything." Extracts from tho Governor's an nual report show that, during a period of sixteen years, 2-102 homesteads jhavc been taken up. Of these llfifl I wore taken up by Huwniluns, r:!l by Portuguese, 100 by other Americans ; find 249 by other people. Of this lot it might be said that 715 wero Anglo j Saxons. These settlers .are not all on tho land now, as some of them havo, sold put and removed from the Ter ritory. "Since last June the Anglo-Saxon homesteader has boon Increasing," HOMES ING RE THE WAR ON MOSQUITOES BEING Doctor Marshall, who Is In charge of the mosquito campaign, reported this morning that the oxtra teams wero ull working on the removal of rubbish Ifrom tho stroets. Twenty wagons, hired by the committee, and j nve county wagons are now uusy in apauns 3 and 5. 'Doctor Marshall thinks that It will take from ton days to two weeks to complete tho Job of ! cleaning up. Tho full forco of nion today will at tack the garbage proposition, nnd also the digging out or banana stumps. Tho gutters and awnings will have to wait for a short time. "Tho garbage on tho streets is an eyesore," remarked Doctor Marshall this morning, "and tho sooner it is i all removed tho better for everyone, j If necessary, moro teams will bo en gaged and tho work rushed to a con clusion." Thero is very littlo water in the catch basins of tho city at present, and what thero is has been oiled to prevent tho mosquitoos depositing tholr eggs there. Tho drip cans aro being prepared, however, and they will bo Installed lu tho noar future. Doctor Marshall ls experimenting with various mixtures and. salt, oil and larvacldo aro being used. Tho best possible stuff for killing tho larvae is being sought, while tho proper doso to apply per Bquaro foot, together with jngo Young presented his brother with . tho Australian rights to his discovery and the latter has made a great sue cess with it. Henry Young intended going to Scotland to interest Colonel Denny, one of the big Clyde shipbuilders, who Is a friend of his, In his discovery. He didn't have to go so far, how over, for coming into contact with Mayor Wadham of San Diego and C. A. Spreckels, they entered Into an agreement with him to put his discov ery on the market in America. His mission to Australia Is to col lect all possible data as to the uso and results of the discovery as oIm served and reported by uBers in the Colonics. Mr. Young claims that his discovery does away with the using of zlno slabs in boilers. If this is so, It is undoubt edly destined to be a very big thing, for It costs an ordinary steamship In the neighborhood of $0000 every year for zlno slabs for tho hollers. E I said the Governor. During the last fiscal jenr 172 homesteads hnve been taken up. Of these 132 were Hnvvaii Inns, seventeen Portuguese, sixteen other Americans and seven of other nationalities." That more land nt Haiku will bo opened up is probnble, according to the Governor. White people nro tak ing up lands right along. Two asso ciations of twenty-eight persons havo been formed to apply for lands. On Thursday next tho Governor and a party of naval officers will niako tho tour of Oahu In automobiles. I.unch will bo served at Hulelwn, and an enjoyable day Is being looked for ward to. Norman II. Smith of Snn Francisco nnd Domlngues' Fcrrelrn, a loeni man, yesterday both concluded short torniB In prison for opium smuggling. other details, will bo studied. A great deal of the banana plants and stumps will bo dumped in low ly ing places and covered with earth. It is thought to bo bettor and cheaper than hauling to the waterfront and then taking out to sea. Tho forco of men at work still remains at 350 and, with tho wagons now In use, It is thought that tho cleaning up will go ahead rapidly. E IS Tho Mills banana caso has again been postponed, this timo until Decem ber 12. It was set for this morning, at which timo testimony was to havo been taken on tho merits of tho caso. Judge Whitney, however, was occu plod with another mattor today and expected to be for somo days to como, so Harry T.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mills' bananas aro still waving bravely In tho breozo, while those of his loss fortunate neighbor's have been laid low and left to rot In tho public highway.
