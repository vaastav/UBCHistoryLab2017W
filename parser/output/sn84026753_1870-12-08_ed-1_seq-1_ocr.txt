To the Senate anii Haute of I?et>re**niatirrs : A year of peace and general prosperity t?? this nation liar* passed since the last assembling of Congress. We have, through a kin<i l*r??vi denee. been blessed with abundant crops, and have been spared from <Amplications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative harmony has been restored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has, by violence and intimidation. been denied to citizens in exceptional cases in several of the Stares lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people thereby been reversed. The States of \ irginia, Mississippi, and Texas have been restored to representation in our national councils. laeorgiu, the only State now without representation, may confi _ dently be expected to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year, and then, let us hope, will he completed lite work of reconstruction. With sin acquiescence on thj} part of the whole people in the national obligation to pay the public debt, created as the price of our union ; the pensions to onr disabled soldiers and sailors, and their widows and orphans : and in the changen to the Constitution winch have been made necessary by * great rebellion, here is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever did, after >o protr uded and devastating a war. 

PROTECTION Ol inRKlii N KRS IN IK\N? K. Soon after the existing war broke out in Kurope, the protection of the Inited State* M inuter in Paris was invoked in luvor t?t North Germans domiciled in French territory. In Ktructions were issued to grant the protection. This has been followed by an extension of American protection to citizens of Saxony, Hesse, and Saxe-Coburg Gotha. Colombia. Portugal, Fragility, the Dominican Kcpuhlie, Kcuador. Chili, Paraguay, and Venezuela, in Paris. The charge was an onerous one,requiring constant and severe labor, as well ?? the exercise of patience, prudence, and good judgment. It has been performed to the entire sat isfaction of this Government, and, as 1 am ofli?-tally informed, npialiy so to ii??- sati-faction of the government of North Germany.

The re establishment. in France, of a *ystem of government disconnected with the dynastic traditions of Fuivpe appeared to he a proper subject f?r the felicitations ol Americans. Should the present struggle n -nit in attaching tije hearts of tlie I rer-cii to our simpler forms of representative government, it will h a siihji'et of still further satisfaction t?i our people. Whiie we make no (ffort to itn pose our institutions upon tlie inhabitants ol ??ther countries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil eont* sfs elsewhere. we can not he indifferent to tlie spread ol American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France. TilK 

XON-INTKRVKMION FOLICV. We were asked by the new government 1g use our good offices, jointly with those of European Powers, in the interests of peace. An swer was made that the established policy and the true interests of the I'nite 1 Sta'es forbade thent to interfere in European questions jointly %th European Powers. 1 ascertained informally and unofficially that the Government oi North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any Powers : and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents, with ail of whom the United States are on terms ol . friendship, I declined on the part of this Gov^ eminent to take a step which coa.d only result in injury to our true interests without advancing the object for which our intervention was invoked. Should the time eoine when the action of the United States van hasten the return of peace, hy a single hour, that act:on will bo 0 heartily taken. I dtemed it prudent, in view f of the number of persons of Geriaaa and French birth living in the United States, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had been received from both belligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of the United States as n neutral, and the obligations of persons residing within their territory to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This proclamation we followed l?v others, as circumstances seemed to ~ r call for them. The people, tbu-? acquainted in advance of their duties and obligations, have assisted iu preventing violations of the neutrality of the United States. TIIK CITAX WAR. It is understood that the condition of t.ie insurrection in Cuba has materially changed since the close of the last session of Congress In an early stage of the contest the uiuhori ties of Spain inaugurated a system of arbitrary 1 arrests, of close confinement, and of military trial ami execrath u of persons suspected nl complicity with the insurgents, and ol summary embargo ol their properties, and sequestration , of their revenues by executive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they aticeted the person* of property of citizens of the United States, were in violation of the provisions of the treaty of 179;?, between the United States ami Spain. Representations ol injuries resulting to several persona claiming to bo citizens of the United States by rea-on of such violations w ere made to the Spani.-h Government. From April lSb'J, to June last, the Spanish Minister at Washington had been clothed with a Inured power to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to l?e withdraw n, "in view," ft* ii was said, "of the favorable situation in which the Island of Cuba ' then "was ; ' which, how ever, did not lead to jl^-cvocation or sti pension of the extraonbuany and ai bitimy (miction! exercised by the cntive power in Cuba, ant we were obliged/to make our compl ?ints a Madrid. > Til K SPANLCll AM?

Hefore sucl an impartial tribin.a! each claimant would hi required to prove his ease. On the oilier ham Spain would he at liberty to traverse every luu ti-rial fact, and thus complete equity would b< done. A case which at one time threatens seriously to aft'ifl the relations between tie United States and Spain has already been dis p ae l of in this way.

Should the authorities of Canada a tempt to enforce it, it will become u?v d ity to t.alcc such steps as may be necessary to protect the 1 du> ol the citi/.ons of the I'uited States. It has ft,urn claimed by h< r Majesty s ofiie.or that the fishing vessels of the I nited* States have no right to enter the open ports ? f the Ifritish possessions in North America, except for the purposes ol shelter atul repairing dam- , ages, ol purchasing wood, and obtaining water; that they have no right to enter at the licitish ! custom houses, or to trade there except, in the purchase of wood and water; and that they must depart within twenty four hour-* alter no- i tiee to leave.

So tar as the claim is founded on an alleged construction of the convention of 1818, it can not be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped tnat it will not be insisted on by her Majesty's Government. During tin# conferences which preceded the negotiations of the convention of IS 18 the ; British commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the tishermeii of ttie United States from "the privilege of carrying on trade with j any of his Britannic Majesty's subjects resid- i ing withiu the limits assigned for their use," and also that it should not he '\awiul for the vessels of tin? United States engaged in said lishery to have on hoard any goods, wares, or merchandise whatever, except such as may be )N, D. C.. THURSDAY. DEC EM necessary for the prosecution of tl: ir voyages to and from the said fishing grounds. And any vessel of the United Stares which shall <?ontra vene this regulation may he seized, condemned, and confiscated, with her cargo. This prep, sirion. which is identic a! with the eonstiaction now put nt>i>n the Irinnu:?<ro of the Uonvention. was emphatically rejected bv the American Uoininissioners, and thereupon was a landotiod by the British plenipotentiaries, aud Article i, as it stands in the Uonvention, was substituted. If, however, it ho said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes and not upon the Convention, this <j .vernment < an not hut regard them as unfriendly and in contravention of the spirit, if not of the letter, of the treaty, lor the faithful execution of which nit* imperial i.overniw'ni is alone responsible. Anticipating that an attempt may possibly bo made by the Canadian authorities in tlie coming season to repeat their uniieighborly acts toward our fishermen, I recommend you t ? confer upon the KxCeutive the power to suspend by proelaiiiatiou the operation of the laws authori/. ng liie transit of goods, w ires, and inerehandixo in bond across th.e territory of the I nited Sfat;s to Canada ; and further, should s?nh an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend tin* operation oi any laws w leicby the ve: scls of the Coniiiiioh of Canada are permitted to enter the waters < ! tiie I nit d Siatt s. \ \Vlt:\ITo\ OK TUK ST.

Murine, the administration of John (tuincy Adams, Mr. Clay unanswerably demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United Stales to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna, in opening ttie llhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of Ktiropean jurists and Stat 'suien, that the inhabitants of a country, through which a navigable river parses, have a n itural right to enjoy the navigu ion of that river to nn I into the sea, even though passing through elm territories of another Mower. This right does not e v dude the coequal right of the sovereign poss^sring tlie territory through w It:< h id 11\ er deboiielies into tho sea, to miko sueh regulations relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary ; but those regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not impose 1 n?erl]ess burdens upon tlie eonimeree w hich ha^ the right of transit. It has been found, in ! practice, move advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement. The United Stales are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of tlie St. Lawrence which may be suggested by tlreat Hritain. II the claim made by Mr. ( lay was just when the population of the States bordering on the shores of the Lukes was onlv A liMiOiio n .? derives ^rcaior force and equity from th?> in creased population, wealth, production, and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in helm!! ot our right the principle lor which he contented has been frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or by treaty, and lias been extended to several other great rivers. ]?y the treaty concluded at Mayenee, in 18dl. the Jtliiuc was declared free lroni the point where it is first navigable into the sea. lly the c->n\ention between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1S;J5, the navigation of the I>ouro, tl:roiighout its whole extent, was made frne for the subjects of both Crowns. In IS,oil the Argentine Confederation, |hy treaty, threw open the free navigation ol tie Panama and the I 'rugnay to the merchant vessels of all nations, in ISfiG the Crimean war was closed by a treats which pro%ided for the tree navigation of the 1'anube. in IS,,; J Poll via, by treatv, declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and l.i Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels, opened by nature, for the commerce of all nations. In I Sol) the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December. 1 Sob, the Emperor of Brazil, by imperial decree, declared t lie Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships ol all nations. The greatest living licit i ' authority on Puis subject, while asserting the-abstract right ol tlie British claim, says : " It seeius tlillieuit to deny that Croat Britain ma ground her rofusul upon strict hit'\ but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises liar-hJv an extreme and hard law ; secondly, that In r conduct with respect to t hi* navigation of tin* St. L awreijce is in glarmp, and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to tin* navigation oi the M ississippi.

Our representatives to all these (Governments have exerted their inlluence to encourage trade l?? tween the United States and the countries to which they are accredited. Hut the fact exists t hat the earn ing is done almost entirely m foreign bottoms, and while this state ol a Hairs exists we cannot control our due share of the eomuioree of the world. That between the Pacific States ami China and Japan is about all the currvintf trade now conducted in American vessels. I would recommend a liberal poiicy toward that line ol Amur.can steamers, one that will insure its success a id even incre ised usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than in foreign countries that, without some assistance from the (Government,they cannot be successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before Congress, in the course of the present session, looking to a remedy for this evil. Uvea if it should bo tit some cost to the national Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be given as will secure American shipping on the high seas and American ship building at home. 

NKCE8.SITY FOR A NEW BUII.DINO FOR TilK STATE DK PA HTM ISN'T. The condition of tbe archives at the Department of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now remcd by that Department is a frail structure, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion, and from the other Departments ; is ill adapted to the purpose for which h is u ei ; has not capacity to accommodate the archives, and is not lireproof. Its remote situation, its slender construction, and tbe absence of a supply ol water f ' m m ? y ?w 1 BER 8. 1870. in ihe neighborhood, leave but little hope of safety for either the building or it-i contents in ease of the accident of a fire. It* de^lruothm would involve f^e loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of < ongr< sof th?? historic records ot The Uev lufi n ami of confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archive* sir.ee the adaption ot the Constitution, and of the many other valuable record* and papers left with that Department when it was the principal depository of the governmental archives. I recommend an aj propriation for the construction of a building fur the Department of State. TRANSFER OF BI REA I s RECOMMKNl EI>. 1 recommend to your consideration the propriety of transfering to the Department of rhe , Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, ail powers and duties in r<datitn to the I\ rritories with wtiich the Department of State is now charged by law or usage; and from the Interior Department to the War Department the Pension I'urcau. eo far as it regulates the payment of soldiers' pensions. 1 would further recommend that the navnomt of naval pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy Ih'partment. ESTIMATES FOR THE NK\T K ISC At. YEAR. The estimates for the expenses of the Government f<>r the 11oxt fiscal year are 818,2 ' I, ' I <'! less than for the current one, but exceed the , appropriations for the present year for the same items ?8,972,127.7'k In this estimate, however, is included j?22,o&\278 ?>7 for public win ks iieretof >re begun under 4'ougri*y>ionnl provi-lon, . and of which only co much is asked as t'onpre-s may choose r?> give. 1'Jie appropriations for tli?? same works for toe present fiscal year was 81 1,98 t.als.iK.

With the ! revenue stamp dispensed by postmasters hi every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjii-tmcnt of the tariff, which will put a doty only upon tense articles which we eou d dispense with, known as luxuries, ami on those which wo use more of than wo produce, revenue enough may be raised, after a few years j of peace and consequent reduction of indebt-1 I edress. to fulfill all our obligations. ffvfvrf. reform. A further reduction of expenses, in addition to a reduction of interest account, may be relied on to make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it means this, has my hearty support. II' it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of Government, for the payment of principal and interest of the public debt, pensions, Arc., by directly taxing the people, then 1 am against revenue reform, and confidently believe the peonle are with me. It it means failure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of Government, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then lain still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform has not been defined l y any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man's want without any costs or effort on h.s , part. A true revenue reform can not be made in a day, but must be the work of national legisla- . tion and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensed with, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of universal u=e not produced by ourselves. The necessities <>f the country compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An ariuv ot asses sors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to I the cit 7. n, but that or a tariff for rc\enue is necessary. Such a tariff, so fur as it acts as an encouragement to home production, affords employment to labor at living wages, in contract to the pauper labor of the Old World, and also in the development of home resources.

This policy, must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the navv, and it is in itself far 11o!n economical, as eat it year that it is pursued the necessity tor mere repairs in ships an ! navy yards becoums more imperative ami more i oslly ; and our curr nt expense? are annually increase ! t??r tiie mere repair of ships, many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. 1 hope, during the present session ol t\>ngress, to he able to submit to it a plan try winch naval vessels can be built and repai.s made with great saving upon the present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents a country with over u,lK)0 miles ol coast line, on l?oth oceans, exclusive of Alaska, ami containing 40,000,Otk> of progressive people, with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inuuequatv. means of enforcing any foreign policy, either of protection or redress.

CIVIL SEhVICF. REFORM. Always favoring practical reform , I r -pectfully call your attention to one ahuv?? of lone standing, whwli I would like to se" remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would ? :v ? it go heyond the mere living of the tor ere ri' rlliee of clerks and employees who do no* require "the advice and consent of the ^ mate " to make their appointments complete. 1 would have it govern, no: the tenure, hut tie* manner, of making all appointments. There G n > duty which s? tnue.h embarrasses the Kxeoutive and heads of Departments as that of appointments ; nor is there any Mich arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The i present system d.,es not secure the best men, and oivcn not even tit men for public place. The. elevation and purification of ttie civil ser vice of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Reform in the management of Indian ntfairs has rem i\ed the special attention of the Admin irsir.ition from its inauguration tu the present day. 'Clu* experiment'if making it a missionary ' work wa? tried with a few agencies, given to the denomination of Friends,and has been found to work most advantageously. All agencies and superintend* ncies not so disposed of were ; given to officers of the army. The act of Congress reducing tl e army render- officers ineligible for civil p. si ions. Indian agencies being civil offices 1 determined to give all the agencies to such rel ic ions denominations us hud ' heretofore e-tahlished missionaries among the Indians, ami perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the work on the same terms. > as a missionary work. The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents, subject to the approval of the Exeeu tive. and arc expected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries, to Christianize and j civilize the Indian, and to train him in the arts of peace. The Government watches over the official acts of these agents, and requires of them as strict an accountability as if they were appointed in any other manner. I entertain the eontident hope that the policy now pursued will, in a few years, bring ail the Indians upon reservations, where they will live in houses, have school-houses and churches, and will be pursuing peaceful and self sustaining av ?ea- ! 'ions, anil where tl ?y may be visited by the law abiding white man with the same impunity that he now visits the civilized white settle-j meats. I eall y ui special attention to the report of the Commissioner of Indian AO: "i<- lor lull information on this subject. tttt: prnt.ic domain*. . During the last fiscal year S. 005,-1 acres of' public land were disposed of. Ot th..- qu antity .'1.61^,91o.nj were tnk"ii under the iioMesread law, and 2,150.51").S1 acroa sold for ca-h. The ' reinumder was located with military warrants, college, or Indian scrip, or appiieu n sati.-fac- ! tion of grants to railroads, or for o;l r public uses. The entries under the homestead law, ; during the last year, covered Do I V15 acres more than those during the proceeding year. Surveys have been vigorously j rosccuteJ to the , fn 11 extent of the means applicable to the purposo. The quantity of land in murk* t will amply supply the present demand. The claim ; of the settler, under the homestead or the preemption law-, is an', however, limited to lands subject to sule at private entry. Any unappropriated surveyed public land may, to a limited amount, be acquired under the form >r laws, il the party entitled to enter under hem will comply with the requirements they proscribe in regard to the residence and cultivation. The netu il settler's preference right of purchase is! even broader, and extends to lands which .were unsurveyed at the time of his settlement. 11 is right was lotuierly confuted within much narrower limits, and a? one period of our history | was conferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from :ime to time to legalize what w as then regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon the national domain. The opin:on that the public lands should he regarded chieliy a> a source of revenue is no longer maintained. ! The rapid settlement and successful cultivation of them is now justly considered of m< re im 1 portanoe to our weft-being than i the fund which the .?;?!e of them would produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new States and Territories attest the wi-d<*m of the legislation which invites the tiller ot the soil to secure a permanent home on terms within i the reach of all. The pioneer, who incurs the dangers and privations of a frontier 1 fV?. and tiius aids in laying .he foundations of new commonwealths, renders a signal service to his country and is entitled to its special <avor and protection. These laws^secure that object, and largely promote the general welfare. They I should, therefore, he cherished a? a permanent feature of our land system. flood faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. i'he time-honored and ben fivent policy of setting apart certain sections of public land lor educational purposes in the j now Slates should be continued. When ample provision shall have been made tor these objects, i submit, as a question worthy of sen- < ous consideration, whether the residue of our national domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provis>ons of the homestead and pre-emption laws. In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the .States in which they are situated, the lands taken under the agricultural college acts, and Ibi internal improvement purposts, under the act of September, 1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed, up to the close of the last fiscal year, by patent or other equivalent evidence of title, to States and corporations, twenty seven million eight hundred and thirty-six thousand two hundred and titty seven and sixty-three hundreths ai res tor rail ways, canals, and wagon roads. It is estimated that an additional quantity of 17 t.7;t.V>-d acres is still due under grants for like usi s. The policy of thus aiding the States in I adding works of internal improvement was in lugurated more than forty years since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois, to aid those Slates in opening onnn's to connect the waters of the Wabash with those of Lake Krie. ana the waters of the 111 nois with those of L ike Michigan. railroad sit as i oils. li was f.Unwed, with some modifications, in tie* grant to Illinois of alternate sections of public land within certain liuuts of the Illinois Central ttailwav. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similar .-ubsidies in connection with railways completed or iu process ot' construction. As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, the -ale of theui at the enhanced price has thus, in many instances, indemnified the treasury tor the granted lauds. The construction ot some of these thoroughfare? has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the development of our resources, and the settlement of the mure distant portions of the country. It may, however, be well insisted that much of our Icgislatum 111 this regard has been characterized by indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The T'nited States should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by States or corporations, nor grant lauds iu any instance, unless the projected work is of acknowledged national liu- j portance. 1 am strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and uunece: sary to bestow subsidies of either description; but should Congress determine otherwise, 1 earnestly reconuuend that the rights oi Settlers and of the public be more effectually secured and pio ected by appropriate legislation.

PFNSIOXS. I Miring the last fiscal year the sum paid to pon-onnors. including the cost of drttbursement, was S-7,7^,811.1 I ; 1.7bounty land warrants were issued. At its close 19*,f>86 names were on the pension rolls. The labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutiny of the evidence submitted in favor of new claims, and to the discovery of fictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed. The appropriation for the employment of special agents for the investigation of frauds has been judiciously used, and the results obtained have been of unquestionable benefit to the service. KDCCATIOS AND AURICL'LTURE. MM - t " i no Funjpet oi education and agriculture are of great interest to the success of our republican institutions, happiness, and grandeur as a nation. In the iuterest of one a bureau has been established in the Interior department? the Bureau of Education; and in the interest of the other a separate department, that of Agriculture. I believe great general good is to How from the operations of both these bureaus if properly fostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too highly the reports of the Commissioners of Kducation and of Agriculture, nor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure their efficacy. POLICY OP TilE ADMINISTRATION. In conclusion, I would sum up the policy of the Administration to he a thorough enforcement of every law; a faithful collection of every tax provided for ; ccouomy in the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment of every debt of the nation ; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit; reductions of taxation and tariff, to be 90 arranged us to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number; honest and fair dealings with flM other peoples, to the end that war, with alt it* blighting consequences, may be avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation duo to ns ; a reform in the treatment of Indians and in the whole civil service of tin* country; and, finally, in securing a pure, untrammcled ballot where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so just once at each election without tear of molestation or proscription ou account of his political faith, nativity, or colorU. S. GRANT. Fvr'U rrvF. Mansion, December .">, 1870. Murdered Uluisters. Just before leaving for Philadelphia word tame to this office that one of our ministers in Alabama had been murdered. We have not yet learned anything of the facts in the case from the papers, but from other sources we have ascertained that the man murdered was Rev. A. Tramel, who was received into the Alabama Confer* nee at its last session in Edwurdsville, and appointed by Bishop Scott to Fredonia Circuit, East Alabama district. We understand that he was assassinated in his own house, and that his body was pierced with forty balls. His son was also murdered. The only fault with which they are charged was Hunnnrtin." :i mrhonl for noli>rn.l Tf J 4 n - ~ WWW* VVi j/V7J'iV. At ff C can get the facts from parties whom we know to he reliable, we shall give them. Such has been our care in similar cases heretofore that no staterneut made in our columns has been specifically denied. General denials and sneers have been hurled at us, but not a contradiction of facts as we have stated them. If this missionary of Jesus had been murdered in India or China, or by the American Indians, the indignation of the whole civilized world would have demanded retribution, and universal sympathy would have been awakened in behalf of the tr leads, the school, and the church of the fallen. Here, however, right under the shadow of the Stars and Stripes, no attention is paid to the event. Members of other Christian (?) churches smile and congratulate themselves that another "Yankee nigger" is out of the way. We confess that we arc ashamed of our church, with all its boasted power, so long as it stands by and sees one after another of its missionaries smitten by the hand of villainy, without uttering a word of couipluint to tnc Government. We are ashamed of ourselves, that we have said so little aiid spoken in terms so mild in relation to this matter. We have not hidden the truth, but have been so exceedingly careful to not over-state facts or unnecessarily annoy the well-disposed portion of the people, that we may have failed to do our whole duty in defence of the lives of our brethren. The church must assert its rights in behalf of our colored neonle. or those murders will rnntimio \V hen the noble and talented Randolph was assassinated two years ago, the whole church should have been stirred and acted unitedly for the protection of its preachers and people. Not long afrer one of our laborers in Texas (a brother Brooks, i! we do not mistake the name) fell by the hands of assassins. In January last Peter Smith, an exhorter, in this State, received a martyr's crown, and now brother Tramel has gone up to carry his story of wrong to the throne of (Jod. How long shall these things continue before the Methodist Episcopal Church is aroused. Auuual Conferences should speak out. The Government should be made to feel these unrebuked wrongs against ns. Add the scores of our people who have fallen martyrs to their love of old Methodism and their country, the hundreds who have been wounded and beaten, and the churches and the school-houses that have been burned, and we can present a chapter of cruelty unparalleled in modern times.

The apparatus essentially consists of a small funnel, having a loog, narrow stem and a caoutchouc base. This instrument is tilled with mercury to a ccrtam distauce up the stem, and its base is applied to the heart or an artery; the oscillations of the mercurial column are then photographed by wellknowu processes. It is said w?th this apparatus the apparently single stroke of the pulse is snown to eousist of three or even four in succession.
