President Taft ent hia annual message to congress today. It ia as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre- ' sentatives: During the part year the foreign re lation of the United States have con tinued npon a basis of friendship and good understanding. The year has been notable as wit nessing the pacific settlement of two Important International controversies before the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration of the fisheries dis pute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the fcouree of nearly continuous diplomatic correspondence since the fisheries con vention' of 1818, has given an award which is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration Is particularly note worthy not only because of the emi nently Just results secured, but also be cause It is the first arbitration held un der the general arbitration treaty of April 4, 1908, between the United States and Great Britain and disposes of a controversy the settlement of which for nearly ninety years has been the cause of friction between two countries whose common interest lies . in maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations with each other. The United States was ably repre sented before the tribunal. The com plicated history of the questions aris . lag made the issue depend more than rdlnarily la such cases npon the care and skill with which our case was presented, and I should be wtmting in proper recognition of a great patriotic service if I did not refer to the lucid historical analysis of the facts and the signal ability and force of arguments six days in length presented to the ourt la support of our case by Mr. Elihu Boot. As secretary of state Mr. Root had given close study to the in tricate facts bearing on the contro versy and by diplomatic correspond ence had helped to frame the issues. At the solicitation of the secretary of . state and myself Mr. Root, though bur dened by his duties as senator from Xew York, undertook the preparation f the case as leading counsel, with the condition imposed by himself that la view of his position as senator he should not receive any compensation. The tribunal constituted at The Hague by the governments of the Unit ed States and Venezuela has completed its deliberations and has rendered an nward In the case of the Orinoco Steamship company against Venezuela. The award may be regarded as satisfac tory since It has, pursuant to the con tentions of the United States, recog nised a number of important principles making for a Judicial attitude in the determining of International disputes. In view of grave doubts which had len raised as to the constitutionality f The Hague convention for the es tablishment of an international prize court, now before the senate for ratifi cation, becaaaa of that provision of the convention which provides that there . may be aa appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, this government proposed In an identic Areolar note addressed to those powers which bad taken part in the London . maritime conference that the powers signatory to the convention, if con fronted with such difficulty, might In sert a reservation to the effect that ap peals to the International prize court In repect to decisions of Its national tribunals should take the form of a di rect claim for compensation, that the oreedlngs thereupon to be taken tould be In the form of a trial de iwvo sod that judgment of the court should consist of compensation for the illegal "apture Irrespective of the decision of he national court whose judgment had bos bewn Internationally involved. .4s the result of an Informal discus sion It was decided to provide such pro-r-edore by means of a separate protocol Which should be ratified at the same time as the prize court convention it self. Accordingly the government of the Netherlands at the request of this gov ernment proposed under date of May 24, 1910; to the powers signatory to The Hague convention the negotiation nt a supplemental protocol embodying stipulations providing for 'this alterna tive procedure. It Is gratifying to ob serve that this additional protocol is being signed without objection by the , jowers signatory to the original con vention and that there is every reason Is beuve that the International prize court will be soon established. - -The Identic .circular note else pro , poeed that the international prize court . when established 'should be endowed i with the functions of an arbitral court ' sf justice iitultnr and pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the lust Hague conference. The replies recelv ' ed from the Tsrions powers to this pro posal inspire the boM turn; this also nay be accomplished wilhin the, rea- and New Labor Laws It is believed that the establishment of these two tribunals will go a long way toward securing the arbitration of many questions which have heretofore threatened and at times destroyed th peace of nations. TO 

APPOINT PEACE COMMIS SIONERS. President Is Waiting For Expres sions From Foreign Powers. Appreciating these enlightened tend encies of modem times, the congress at its last session passed a law provid ing for the appointment of a commis sion of five members "to be appointed by the president of the United States to consider the expediency of utilizing existing international agencies for the purpose of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by interna tional agreement and of constituting the combined navies of the world an international force for the preserva tion of universal peace and to consider and report upon any other means to diminish the expenditures of govern ment for military purposes ' and to lessen the probabilities of war." I have not, as yet made appointments to this commission because I have in vited and am awaiting the expressions nf foreign governments as to their will ingness to co-operate with us in the appointment of similar commissions or representatives who would meet with our commissioners and by joint action seek to make their work effective. -Europe, Canada, Etc Several important treaties have been negotiated with Great Britain in the past twelve months. A preliminary diplomatic agreement has been reach ed regarding the arbitration of pecu niary claims which each government has against the other. This agree ment, with the schedules of claims annexed, will, as soon as the schedules are arranged, be submitted to the sen ate for approval. An agreement Between the United States and Great Britain with regard to the location of the international boundary line between the United States and Canada in Passamaqnoddy bay and to the middle of Grand Ma han channel was reached in a treaty concluded May 21, 1910, which has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed, thns making unnecessary the arbitration provided for la the previous treaty of April 11, 1908. The convention concluded Jan. 11, 1909, between the United States and Great Britain providing for the settle ment of international differences be tween the United States and Canada, including the apportionment between the two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of commissioners to adjust certain oth er questions, has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed. The work of the international fish eries commission appointed in 1908, tinder the treaty of April 11, 1908, be tween Great Britain and the United States has resulted in the formulation and recommendation of uniform regu lations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and the United States for the purpose of pro tecting and increasing the supply of food fish in such waters. In comple tion of this work the regulations agreed upon require congressional leg islation to make them effective and for their enforcement in fulfillment of the treaty stipulations. 

OVERTHROW OF KINS MANUEL United States Recognized Portugal Provisional Republic. In October last, the monarchy in Portugal was overthrown, a provision al republic was proclaimed, and there was set up a de facte government which was promptly recognized by the government of the United States for purposes of ordinary intercourse pend ing formal recognition by this and oth er powers of the governmental entity to be duly established by the national sovereignty. ' Liberia. A disturbance among the native tribes of Liberia in a portion of the re public during i-.jbe early part of this year resulted in the sending under the Jj-eiity of 1862 -of an American vessel of war to the dUaffeeted district, and the ijLiberian authoritien,- assisted by the good offices of the Ajn-rican naval fhc-s, were able to restore order. The negotiation whicff'litfVe been un dertaken for the amelioration of the condition found in Liberia by the American commission, whose report I transmitted to congress on March 25 last. -are being brought to ooucluslon. nd it is thought that witbin a short time practical measures of relief may In Message flees of this government and the cor dial co-operation of other governments interested in Liberia's welfare. The Near East Turkey. To return the visit of the special em bassy sent" to announce the accession of his majesty Mehemet V., emperor of the Ottomans, I sent to Constanti nople a special ambassador, who, in addition to this mission of ceremony, was charged with the duty of express ing to the Ottoman government the value attached by the government of the United States to increased and more important relations .between the countries and the desire of the United States to .contribute to the larger eco nomic and commercial development due to the new regime in Turkey. The rapid development now begin ning in that ancient empire and the marked progress and increased com mercial importance of Bulgaria, Rou mania and Servia make It particularly opportune that the possibilities of American commerce In the near east should receive due attention. Montenegro. The national skoupchtlna having ex pressed Its will that the principality of Montenegro be raised to the rank of kingdom, the Prince of Montenegro on Aug. 15 last assumed the title of king of Montenegro. It gave me pleasure to accord to the new kingdom the rec ognition of the United States. The Far East. The center of interest in far eastern affairs during the past year has again been China. It is gratifying to note that the ne gotiations for a loan to the Chinese government for the construction of the trunk railway lines from Hankow southward to Canton and westward through the Yangtse valley, known as the Hukuang loan, were concluded by the representatives of the ' various financial groups in May last and the results approved by their respective governments. The agreement, already initialed by the Chinese government, is now awaiting formal ratification. The basis of the settlement of the terms of this loan was one of exact equality be tween America. Great Britain, France and Germany in respeet to financing the loan and supplying materials for the proposed railways and their future branches. The application of the principle un derlying the policy of the United States in regard to the Hukuang loan viz, that of the internationalization of the foreign interest In such of the railways of China, as may be .financed by for eign countries was suggested on a broader scale by the secretary of state ia a proposal for internationalization and commercial neutralization of all the railways of Manchuria. While the principle which led to the proposal of this government was generally admit ted by the powers to whom it was ad dressed, the governments of Russia and Japan apprehended practical difficul ties in the execution of the larger plan which prevented their ready adher ence. The question of constructing tho Chinchow-Aigun railway by means of an international loan to China Is, how ever, still the subject of friendly dis cussion by the interested parties. The policy of this government in these matters has been directed by a desire to make the use of American capital in the development of China au instrument la the promotion of China's welfare and material prosperity with out prejudice to her legitimate rights as an independent political power. This policy has recently found fur ther exemplification in the assistance given by this government to the nego tiations between China and a group of American bankers for a loan of $50, 000,000 to be employed chiefly in. cur rency reform. The confusion which has from ancient times existed In the monetary usages of the Chinese has been one of the principal obstacles to commercial Intercourse with that peo ple. The United States in its treaty of 1903 with China obtained a pledgs from the latter to introduce a uniform national coinage, and the following year, at the request of China, this gov ernment sent to Peking a member of the international exchange commission to discuss with the Chinese govern ment the best methods of introducing the reform. In 1908 China sent a com missioner to the United States to con sult with American financiers as to the possibility of securing a large loan with which to inaugurate the new cur rency system, but the death of their majesties the empress dowager and the emperor of China interrupted the ne gotiations, which were not resumed un til a few months ago, wheD this gov ernment was ssked to communicate to the bankers concerned the request, of China for a loan of $50,000,000 for the purpose under review. A preliminary agreement between the American group and China has been made covering the loan. For the success of this loan and' the contemplated reforms which are of the greatest importance to the commercial interests of the United States and the civilized world at large it is realized that an expert will be necessary, and this government has received assur ances from China that such an advis er, who shall be an American, will be engaged. It is a matter of interest to Ameri cans to note the success which is at tending the efforts of China to estab lish gradually a system of representa tive government. The provincial as semblies were opened In October, 1909, and lu October of the present year a consultative body, the nucleus f the fnfitre national parliament, held Its first session at Pttklng. The year has further been marked by two important international agree ments relating to far eastern affairs. InJheKui!-Jfcai4tise ajirwiiipnfcjriv latlng to Manchuria, signed July 4, 1910, this government was gratified to note an assurance of continued peaceful conditions in that region and' the reaffirmation of the policies with respect to China to which the United Btates together with all other inter ested' powers are alike solemnly com mitted. The treaty annexing Korea to the empire of Japan, promulgated Aug. 29, 1910, marks the final step in a process of control of the ancient em pire by her powerful neighbor that has been in progress for several years past. In communicating the fuct of annexa tion the Japanese government gave to the government of the United States assurances of the full protection of the rights of American citizens in Ko rea under the changed conditions. Friendly visits of many distinguish ed persons from the far east have been made during the year. Chief among these were their imperial highnesses Princes Tsal-tao and Tsai-Hsun of China and his imperial highness Prince Higashl Fushiml and Prince Tokugawa, president of the house ot peers of Japan. The secretary of war has recently visited Japan and China in connection with his tour to the Philippines, and a large delegation ot American business men are at present traveling in China. This exchange of friendly visits has had the happy ef fect of even further strengthening our friendly international relations. 

TROUBLES OF LATIN AMERICA. We Are at Peace, but War Bothers Southern Republics. During the past year several of our southern sister republics celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of their independence. In hcraor of these events special embassies were sent from this country to Argentina, Chile and Mexico, where the gracious re ception and splendid hospitality ex tended them manifested the cordial relations and friendship existing be tween those countries and the United States, relations which I am happy to believe have never before been upon bo high a plane and so solid a basis as at present. The congressional commission ap pointed under a concurrent resolution to attend the festivities celebrating the centennial anniversary of Mexican Independence, together with a special ambassador, were received with the highest honors and with the greatest cordiality and returned with the report of the bounteous hospitality and warm reception of President Diaz and the Mexican people, which left no doubt of the desire of the immediately neigh boring republic to continue the mutual ly beneficial and intimate relations which I feel sure the two governments will ever cherish. At the fourth pan-American confer ence, which met in Buenos Aires dur ing July and August, last, after seven weeks of harmonious deliberation three conventions were signed provid ing for the regulation of trademarks, patents and copyrights, which, when ratified by Hie different governments, will go far toward furnishing to Amer ican authors, patentees and owners of trademarks the protection needed hi localities where heretofore it has been either lacking or inadequate. Further, a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of important resolutions pass ed. The conventions Will in due course be transmitted to the senate, and the report of the delegation of the United States will be communicated to the congress for its information. The special cordiality between representa tive men from all parts of America which was shown at this conference cannot fail to rnact upon and draw still closer the relations between the countries which took part in it. The international bureau of Ameri can republics is doing a broad and use ful work for pan-American commerce and comity. Its duties were much en larged by the international conference of American states at Buenos Aires, and its name was shortened to the more practical and expressive term of pan-American, union. Located now in its new building, which was specially dedicated April 26 of this year to the development of friendship, trade and peace among the American nations, it has improved instrumentalities to s'erve the twenty-two republics of this hem isphere, j I am glad to say that the action of the United States in Its desire to re move imminent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growiDg out of a boundary dispute, with the co-operation of Brazil and the Argentine Re public as joint mediators with this gov ernment, has already resulted success fully in preventing war. The govern ment of Chile, while not one of the mediators, leat effective aid in further ance of a preliminary agreement likely to lead on to an amicable settlement, and it is not doubted that the good offices of the mediating powers and the conciliatory co-operation of the govern ments directly interested will finally lead to a removal of this perennial cause of friction between Ecuador and Peru. The inestimable value of cordial co-operation between the sister repub lics of America for the maintenance of peace in this hemisphere has never been more clearly shown than in this mediation, by which three American governments have given to this hemis phere the honor of first invoking the most farreaching provisions of The Hague convention for the pacific set tlement of international disputes. There has been signed by the repre- sentatives of the United States and Mexico a protocol submitting to the United States-Mexican boundary com mission (whose membership for the purpose of this case Is to be increased by the addition of citizen of Qwa dJ.ULe.ja.ijjjfferphrn$y oyer v.i.-, ,.,".. .... , ..m-u nes wiuiui the present physical boundaries of the city of VA Paso, Tex. The determina tion of this question will remove a source of no little annoyance to the two governments. The republic of Honduras has for many years been burdened with a heavy bonded debt held In Europe, the Interest on which long ago fell in ar rears. Finally conditions were such that It became imperative to refund the debt and place the finances of the republic upon a sound basis. Last year a group of American bankers un dertook to do this and to advance funds for railway and other Improve ments contributing directly to the country's prosperity and commerce an arrangement which has long been de sired by this government. Negotiations to this end have been under way for more than a year, and it is now confi dently believed that a short time will suffice to conclude an arrangement which will be satisfactory to the for eign creditors, eminently advantageous to Honduras and highly creditable to the judgment and foresight of the Honduranean government. This is much to be desired since, as recognized by the Washington ' conventions, a strong Honduras would tend immense ly to the progress and prosperity of Central America. During the past year the republic of Nicaragua has been the scene of in ternecine struggle. General Zelaya. for seventeen years the absolute ruler of Nicaragua, was throughout his ca reer the disturber of Central America and opposed every plan for the pro motion of peace and friendly relations between the five republics. When the people of Nicaragua were finally driven into rebellion by his law less exactions he violated the laws of war by the unwarranted execution of two American citizens who had regu larly enlisted in the ranks of the rev olutionists. This and other offenses made it the duty of the American gov ernment to take measures with a view to ultimate reparation and for the safeguarding of its interests. This involved the breaking off of all dijSlomatic relations with the Zelaya government for the, reasons laid down in a communication from the secretary ot state, which also notified the con tending factions in Nicaragua that this government would hold each to strict accountability for outrages on the rights of American citizens. American forces were sent to both coasts of Ni caragua to be in readiness should oc casion arise to protect Americans and their interests and remained there un til the war was over and peace had returned to that unfortunate country. These events, together with Zelaya's continued exactions, , brought him so clearly to the bar of public opinion that he was forced to resign and to take refuge abroad. In the above mentioned communica tion of the secretary of state to the charge d'affaires of the Zelaya govern ment the opinion was expressed that the revolution represented the wishes of the majority of the Nicaraguan peo ple. This has now been proved beyond doubt by the fact, that since the com plete overthrow of the Madriz govern ment and the occupation of the capital by the forces of the revolution all fac tions have united to maintain public or der, and as a result of discussion with an agent, of this government sent to Ma nagua at the request of the provisional government comprehensive plans are being made for the future welfare of Nicaragua, including the rehabilitation of public credit. The moderation and conciliatory spirit shown by the vari ous factions give ground for the con fident hope that Nicaragua will soon take its rightful place among the law abiding and progressive countries of the world. It gratifies me exceedingly to an nounce that the Argentine Republic some months ago placed with American manufacturers a contract for the con struction of two battleships and certain additional naval equipment. The ex tent of this work and its importance to the Argentine Republic make the plac ing of the bid an earnest of friendly feeling toward the United States. Tariff Negotiations. The new tariff law in section 2 re specting the maximum and minimum tariffs of the United States, which pro visions came into effect on April 1. 1910, imposed upon the president the responsibility of determining prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the Unit ed States and its products in any coun try of the world with which we sus tained commercial relations. In the case of several countries In stances of apparent undue discrimina tion against American commerce were found to exist. These discriminations were removed by negotiation. Prior to April 1, 1910, when the maximum tariff was to come into operation with respect to importations from all those countries in whose favor no proclama tion applying the minimum tariff should be issued by the president, 134 puch proclamations were Issued. This series of proclamations embraced the entire "commercial world, and hence the minimum tariff of the United States has been given universal appli cation, thus testifying to the satisfac tory character of our trade relations with foreign countries. Marked advantages to the commerce of the United States' were obtained through these tariff settlements. For eign nations are fully cognizant of the fact that under section 2 of the tariff act the president Is required, when ever he Is satisfied that the treat ment accorded by them to the prod ucts of the United States Is not such as to entitle them to the benefits of the minimum tariff of the United States, to withdraw those benefits by procla mation, giving ninety days' notice, after which the maximum tariff will apply to their dutiable products enter ing the United States. In Its general operation this section of the tariff law has thus far proved a guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there are. however, unfortunately In stances where foreign governaeats deal arbitrarily with American inter ests within their Jurisdiction In a man ner injurious and inequitable. trade relations with the Dominion of Canada which was initiated in the ad justment of the maximum -and mini mum provisions of the tariff act of August, 1909, has proved mutually beneficial. It justifies farther efforts for the readjustment of the commer cial relations of the two countries o that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contiguous coun tries and be comtnensurate with the steady expansion of trade and Indus try on both sides of the boundary line. The reciprocation on the part of the Dominion government of the sentiment which was expressed by this govea-tt-ment was followed In October by the suggestion that it would be glad to have the negotiations which had been temporarily suspended during the stam mer resumed. In accordance With "fats suggestion the secretary of state by. my direction dispatched two represent atives of the department of state, as special commissioners to Ottawa tow confer with representatives of the Do minion government. They were a thorized to take such steps for formu lating a reciprocal trade agreement mm might be necessary and to receive and consider any propositions which the Dominion government might care te submit. ' Pursuant to the instructions issued conferences were held by ' these ' com missioners with officials of the Domin ion government at Ottawa in the early part of November. The negotiations were conducted on both sides in a spirit of mutual accom modation. The discussion of the com mon commercial interests of the two countries had for its object a satisfac tory basis for a trade arrangement which offers the prospect of a freer in terchange for the products of the Unit ed States and of Canada. The confer ences were adjourned to be resumed la Washington in January, when it Is hoped that the aspiration of both gov ernments for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be realised.
