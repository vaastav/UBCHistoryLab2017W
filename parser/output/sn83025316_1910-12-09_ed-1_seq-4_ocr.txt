Iy i)sdev4 J. Haskin. 'The armistci e between the two bat- 1 tleng parties In British politics which tolldwed' the death of ,Cdward VII cooled the passions of men .on both sides and leAt to a 'general desire to settl0ethe controversy .between the two houses of perllamnt by co ro Silse. The party leadersa n for, and .ith6y seleoted ur i ais representing the mlnlsfy and four tories representing the opposition, and gave them plenary powers to treat. This unofficlal comfMssion to decide the -fate of ..the oonstitution. of the greatest nation on earth had no stand ing in law, but with the spirit of con fldenge 'in public serivants so 'carac teristic of the British people, practi p~lly all divuslion of thil 'great qtestion was stopped. It was a truce Q,. GQd.. With chrmK.ingg;.Iipplicity the British empire delegated its future to eight men and called them the Con ference. Sometimes someone would say "Constitutional Conference." but usually the one word with its capital "C", was sufficient. The Conference ,met 22 times. Not a word leaked out ef the Council cham ber. The .whole nation waited breath IwPsly for the decision, Iut. it also waited patiently $ndt' with Confidence. the British people were divided into camps and each camp w.sle presented in the parley by four npn. As a mat ter of fact there was not the slight eAt "chafnce o 'f -an' ' ratEement. "The question under conslderlttion was fun damental. If one '6f the fotlr radicals had wavered the democracy of the nation would have torn him limb from limb. If one Of the tbrles 'had capltulated. in the slikhtesti matter, the aristocracy of Britain would have drunk his 'blood. Finally' the enid came." The prime minister.announced through the press in four lines of type the fact that the Conference had come *tb no agree ment: The truce was ended and mat . trs were back where they stood when death claimed Edward VII and ele yited George' V to. the throne. The ilberal governalent was unwilling to proceed to its business of legislation Wtless it was assuired .that:. It, had a chance of passing ith measures into ltw. With the house of l.ords.-'coni trolle#l by an overwhelming! majoiity of tories there was no such chahce tnder bthe existing constitutlon 'the commo'ns had won before 'the' people 14 t)ieir contention that they might pAntrp1i the money bills. ,But the gov einment was .not conteit: to go on tinlea.' its powers Were 'enlarged 'so that it' nmight censlder other matters of legislation with ,some reasopable hope of success. The parliament. reas senmbled and the veto bill was brought out: " t\.he prime minister, with that di rg.ms . e4.. inrtasslbie. In .,anM..Ame.rtcan statesman who is slave to the calen dltr, said the Conference' had failed and that 'there wks' no use of Iteep ing up the' farce any longer, 'Either the people's' chose"' r'ipieiedtatives 'had the right and power to legtslsete o,, they didl not tiavb that;. right and' 'power. The bill giving 'them that power; ubject' 'to the "dilaltOi'y:iut 'nut: conclusble, veto of the upper chant her, was sent to 'the lords; . The lords lMotied 'the' -bill and.-: 'onnrltered' by' proposing a soheme fOrethe reform of the, upper chamber, vtluntarlly aban doning the heriditary principle in part and making sweeping concessions with respect to the form of 'their house. But their concepsions were not such as to cohiyince the liberals that they 'would result ,in. the control of .the. house by any other than the arlsto cra'tic and plutocratic elements now dominant' there;' The radltals' desired to' end, not, mend, the second cham her in its preseqt character. .'So the lords passed their "reform" resolutions and the commons passed their "veto" bill, each hiodie Ignored the action of the other and the king, by advice 'of his ministers, 'dlssolved the parliament and 'the campaign for a general election 'was on' , In the conference the liberals were represented by three commnoners and a peer, the consergatlves'by two peers and two commoners. the radial mem bers were Mr. Asquith, Mr. Llyod, George. Lord Crewe'. and Mr. Birrell. The tory conferees were Mr. Balfour, Lord Lansdowne, Lord Cawdor 'and Mr. Austen Chamberlain. But whether nobles or commoners, the eight men divided. as Englishmen will, with ref erence 'to the' substance' and'. nit the form of things. Lord Crewe, judged by -his record as- the leader= of the government in the house of 'lords. is well nigh as radical a democra' 'aas is Mr. '.loyd-George himself. Mr, 'Balr four, although a commoner, is of the (ecil 'blood and an aristocrat who sin cerely and honestly believes that thle triumph' of the- democratic forces would mean the eej d 9f all that is great and glorious and good in Eng land. SIf the Conference had had under consideration' a political quarrel, a 'fliancial 'question, a sdocal problem, or' anything. othet than a fundamen tal 'constitutional Issue, there Is. little doubt but that a compromise would have been reached. The Englishmahi swears by compromise. It represents the fair-play 'doctrine ?Qr give-and take, and it is by a series of compro mises that John Bull has cemented the stones of his unmatched national edifice. The British constitution is nothing more than a series of compro mises, more often expressed in gentle-' men's agreements than in official proclamation. The king is bound' to act by the advice of his ministers as a result of a 'long series of compro mises. in avhich the' crown gradually gave up one after another of its pre rogatives in emachange for the boon 'qf its perpetuation. The most' difficult purely political problem in British affairs is the Irish question. ' Ireland has been ruled against its will: by the English for a ihatter of 700 years. A little' more than 'a century ago its separate par litament was ektinguished b the treabhery of its own representatlves, corrupted by #ritish promises "- and bribes. Ever since the p e of the "act of union" the' IAih have been struggling by every, means at hand to' get back their freedom, at least as far as their internal affairs were concerned. In the past half century Sn o helt, deiand h bee xpes b thir slhsga ule for Ire d.' Mr. Gladst e, 'the `grea t iberal leader, gradually progressing toward complete democracy, suddenly decided 1 to give the Irlsh *h-itat they wanted. o Under his leadership the commons paned' a bill giving Ireland its long- t prayed-for home rule. The bill was re ejeted by the lords. and an appeal was had to the country. What remained iof the old whig aristocracy in the liberal party deserted the, Gladstone banger and, calling themselves liberal-union ists, joined with the tories. The lib erals were defeated and for years were unable to regain power except at the price of suppressind home rule. The issue was so great in interest and Im portance that the name "unionist" after a time superseded the name "conservative" as the official title-of the major fractiqn pf the tory, party. The liberals, mindful of their disaster under Gladstonp.oand being, after all, nothing more: nor less than English men, were ch.rry of opening the Irish question. In the parliament, elected last Jan uary the Irish party.- held the balance of power, and .John iRedmond, the Irish leader, became the "'dictator" of England. It was very fine for Eng land 'tq rule Ireland, but ,many Eng lishmen soon found that it was pos sible under the terms of the, union for Iieland to rule England-a very different matter.. So. there arose in the unionist party a strong sentiment in favor of going back on their rec ord of seven centuries, and on their very name, that they might win Irish favor by consenting to a federal home rule plan' which' would place Ireland in the -same relatlor4, to the kingdoin that Ohio bears to the American union or that Ontario bears to the Dominion of Canada. Acute as is the Iriih question, the apparent willingness' of the unionists to consider a 'compromise Indicated that if the conference of eighit had been called upon to decide the vexe~d question of hime rule an agireoment would have been .resched. But the time had come w neh' home rule was only one of the man., things that the democratic element demanded an its right. The 'controver l# between the lords and the commnpnU c,uld not be quieted by a deal With an Ilrish pbli tician. Neither the Irsh. anr the liberals were willing, to a,:';)t this sop. The liberaly' wanted to .havw the right to oojitrpl the goverlsqj"t ~her. rq power on an equal basis with conservatives when in power, antd' td tdo this they must, remove th- ý;et'-,·-.woer of the lords. The Irish wHere convinced Ihat they never would-get more than half a loaf until the lor d were hurled "fropl power. The coalition stood in spite of' all. the efforts made to break it,, 'nd ini spiteof, the gllve- bjanches held - iut by " the now 'thoroughly (rtightened tories. No one knows what was said in the conference, but it is genegally be lieved that other political questions were' discussed and that there was room for compromise on ail of them, as 'well as on the much 'mooted Irish question. BBdt 'the conservatives; would not yield in their adherence to the principle that ' the' upper chamber ought to represent certain interests removed fltom the people and.. that these Interests, might. of right nega tive the people's will as expressed by their 'chosen' representktives. On the other hand, the liberals' Would not wield one jot or .tittle ferom their de clared principle . that the commons ought to have the right to, eahet into law any measure thrhi'e: a.re0d ,upon within the lifetime 'of a slhigle' parlia ment. When the conference brqke up there was nothing to tell. Both sides came otmt as they went in. Each: was deter mined to place its propositionis before the people. The electors were given the same arguments that were made in conference, in essence,. 31nd now they are speaking their will The liberals said the campaign was that of the people against the peers. The conservatives said that the cam paign was that of the " constitution against tile demagogues. Everybody 'had an opportunity to judge for him self and to vote as he saw flt--that is, provdlng he lhad a vote, soine tfree Enp.lishnien have no vo4e k : a ill; and others have many votes, 'but that' 1s a mere detail.
