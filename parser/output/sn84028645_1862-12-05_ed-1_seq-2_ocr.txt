Oinui le the treat erpsueDt of the princl plei tad measures of the sdvance guard of the R.m.MliMn a Abolition OMtT. Speaking Ol that wi of the President's meeMge whioh re- ., letae to slavery, Gemlit says la the Tribuni of the 31 bet.: "Essentially, the President aeea and Moclalms that slavery has become the im placable foe of the American Union, and that the Blare Power must die in oraer mat tne no- ttrbllo mar life." The Slave Power" slavery moetdie muet he ebolIahed-ennibUeied'. Tula Is the Aboil tlon decree -the great end for which, on radloal DtlndDlaa. the war la to be prosecuted. They may deny it and say they do not want an Aboli tion war; that It ie treason to obargetnem wits such a desiini bat what else does Gniui mean when he say s the President "can only sere the Union by ftntUllng 1U arch enemy" that U alaven. Accordini to Guulbt and the raa- . ieele, throttle or destroy slavery, and the work Is done. Thedestroottonof slavery la the g'eet, the practioable and Immediate object in the radical mind to be attained by the war. Bat Ouiur, like other Republicans of the same stamp, talks of "saving the Union." Sav ing the Union 1 What Union 1 Not the Union WajMitfOTOW and the fathers made. Not that at all That, according to the Abolitionists, is deed and gone past saving. They declare In effect that the rebellion has triumphed and de stroyed the old Union, and now they want to .f"h1estroy slavery, end then the work of desiruo . t wlllbe complete all round. bkclct says, in the paper quoted from ' aL jve, that President Lmcolw would gladly Uave restored the Union ae it was; but that was vot possible- So here the radicals have set down the stake us the point of departure for them, namely that a restoration of the Union has become absolutely impossible. Searing this in mind, we shall know how to estimate all the Republican or Abolition talk about saving the Union and a war for toe Union. They don't mean the Union as it was. This they hare themselves asserted over and over again Therefore, a there never was but the one Union la this country, they don't mean (At Union at ell, bnt some humbng or hoc as pocas of their own contrivance. On the main point the destruction of slavery and the Impossibility of saving the Union Gimir says he heartily agrees with the Presi dent; bnt he differs with him on the subject of gradual emancipation and negro exportation. Ouii.it Is for Immediate total emancipation end for keeping all ths niggers in the country. "Bat so long as the great sod" the destruc tion of slavery and of the Union "is kept steadily in view," Guelit and the radloals "can waive all Incidentals." Though the President in hit message does not come fully4 p to their stand-point, yet as gradual emend- pation, oompensatiaa for slaves, and negro ex porta tlon are bnt tubs thrown to amuse the whale meaning, of course. Conservative Un lonlam GitaxiT advisee bis radloal brethren; In tha nam lima, to ha "natlant and work." The President's Compromise. The President has fuUy imbibed the radical , Idea that this -war Is a war solely about slavery, sad that to end the war ilavery must be abolish ed. Be, therefore, In his message, proposes a compromise between radicalism and slavery. He suggests amendmenti to the Constitution, whioh will require the assent of two-thirds of both branches of Congress, and of ail the free States end seven of the slave States. This plan. shows that the President, instead of rising "high with the occasion," sinks Infinitely What the country needs in this fearful crisis Is something practicable, Immediate and de eislve in Its operation. While Congress is dis cussing the President's amendments, the wtr will go oni the waste of life, the expenditure of mosey, end the destruction of property will eostlsos. It Is not at ell probable that the President's propositions will be finally noted tpoa la Congress before January 1st. ; Indeed, the President himself doee not seem to antici pate that they will be, for he says that nsitbrr the war nor proceedings under the proolame tlo of September 22, will be stayed because of the recommendation of Us compromise plan. So the war will be prose on ted while his eon etltuUonai amendments are being discussed In Congress. Even should they obtain the tcqui site two-thirds majority la Congress, so mortal enppoees that three-fourths of the States will adopt them 'pilor to the first day of January Then, if the President keeps his word, sn edict win be Issued; in pursuanoe of his emancipation proclamation, declaring eS the slaves without eaoeptioa la certain States and parts of States forever free And this act of total and Imme diate emancipation is to be earrled Into effect by the army and osvy of the United States, la the teeth of hl message end la direct opposi tion to tha letter sod. spirit of the President's own propositions for constitutional provisions for gradual emancipation by the States them oeivtt, for eompenwtlon and "colonisation, sad oa has ate, tbe for in. iv u ra vat rendlDa before . - k. 4ttA adnntlnn nf tila gent Liihoomi insist - r -- plan will etey both the war ana prooeeatngs under his proclamation, when hs knows that it Is not possible for his plau -to be adopted oeiore January 1SI, wueo tu enauoiiiakiuu ummrm n w bs issued.

Mr. Lovejoy moved to lay the motion on tbe table. Carried by 74 agaiost eu, We desire to place these resolutions on rec ord, as evidence forever of the utter tyranny which has been sanctioned by the dominant (ar ty. In voting down Mr. Cox's resolution, they condemn every principle of constitutional lib erty asserted in En-land for hundreds of years, and repeatedly re asserted In tbe Bill of Rights of every constitution In America. These prin ciples of civil liberty, so salutary to pnblio safe iy, were applied by Republicans when their par ty. was "young and pure," to the alleged wrongs of Kacsas. Oa the 18lh of Jane, 1856, at tbe National Republican Conveatloa la Philadel phia, a protect was entered egalnet tbe usurpa tion of officials "sustained by the military pow er of the Government," to enforce end make tyrannical and nnconatitutlonsl laws; and ths right of the people to be secure in tbelr per sons, houses, pipers and effecta against unrea sonable seisores was promulged, as if It were something novel then. . At the same time, it was charged that the people of Kansas were "deprived of life, liberty and property, without du prtctn cf Ua, What more doee this resolution of Mr. Cox allege? If its allegations be not true, why re fuse inquiry into the facts as called for by Gov RicBauDsoiTs resolution f We are pained to see the names of Messrs. HoaToaand Hamisoh vot ing to crush out such principles of publlo liberty and all inquiry Into them. We expected better things from them. Bat with Bimohsji, Colfax, Lovijot, and the rest, sueh votes sre in ever lasting harmony with their natures. When suoh ststeamsa as Judge Thomas of Mass, Gov. Csirrainin, Gbamou of Michigan, Shit- nxLBof Rbode Island, Wicxurvi of Kentucky, and others, vote to condemn such sets, and when such votes represent as they do the now dom inant sentiment of the nation, we may hope for better days-

PENSIONSâ€”TO WHOM AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES GRANTED. For the benefit of the now very large and in creasing number of invalid (tick or woacded) discharged soldiers or seameu, we publish a synopsis of the law relating to Fensiots, as con tained in the act of Congress jif July 14tb, 1862: BP By this set it is provided that the following persons shall be entitled to receive pensions, under (be prescribed regulations governing tbem: I. Invalids disabled since March 4, 1861, In the milltiry or naval service of the United States in the line of duty. II. Widows ot officers, soldiers or seamen dying of wounds received, or of disease con tracted, in tbe military or naval service, as abovo. III. Children, nnder sixteen yeais of age, of such deceased persons, if there is no widow surviving, or from tbe time of tbe widow's re marriage. IV. Mothers (who have no husband living) of officers, soldier or seamen, deceased as aforesaid, provided the latter have left neither widow or children under sixteen years of age; and provided, also, that tbe mother was depen dent wholly or to part upon the deceased for support. . . v V. Sisters, under sixteen years of age, of snon deceased persons, dependent on toe latter wholly or In pari for support, provided there are no rightful claimants ot either of the three last preeedlns classes. The ratee of pension are distinctly set forth la the act, end are according tj the elasses or grades ranging rrom eight ) to thirty (30) dol Jars per month. - Unit one pension in any case Is allowed to one person or the relatives thereof. When more than one minor child or orphan sister becomes entitled to pension it must be divided equally between them. . . The pension, under taia law, will commence from the data of the pensioner's discharge, if applied for within one year thereafter. Other wise the pension will commence from tbe date ef the application pensions to widows and minors from the date of the death of the person upon whose service the calm is based. The Identity ol tbe claimants must be es tablished in accordance with the provisions of the act. If possible, the certificate of the Captain or some other commissioned officer nnder whom he served, should be produced, stating time and place of the applicant's having been wounded or disabled, etc. II for any reason it be impracticable to ob taia such certificate, it must be, stated by ap plicant under oath, and the ' fact substan tiated by other witnesses of known respectabili ty, ete. - ." ' A sureeen'e certificate mast show tbe char acter and degree or tbe claimant's disability, ine namta or tne annnoant. and bis rami na tion since be left the service, moat be shown by . - iili. . . iwu ureuiuie wimuBues. If the applicant be a widow, she must prove the legality of her marriage, the death of her nuaeend, and mat she is still a widow. 8h must also furnish tbs nsmee and aces of t .Lfll ner cuuarea unaer sixteen years or age, and toe piaoe oi nor resilience. If married strain, her neosion will cbaia and her minor children, If any be living, will re ceive tbe pension in her stead, from the date of such marriage. If the applicants be minors, ths proof of the marriage oi parents will suit DO required. If the applicant be a mother of tbe deoeased soldier, similar proof will be rrauired of the marriage ot ine oiaimant and ot her widow hood. -. The same proof of mtrriase and of rela. UonshiD will be rrauired If the claimant he a sister. Tbe above comprises the main feature of the law, which we have abstracted from a printed copy of tbe Act.

Ibe above is a lie no other word will nro perly meet such a false and unfonnded asser tion.

V.wmn hv aitrllnf tnffth Aah1 Wslte's votes, in this District, and counting them all as Republicans, tbe Demoorata still have a majority on the vote for Cona-reasmen. in the State, of 1,665. But it is manifestly unfair to count Waite's vote as Republican, be cause one-half, at least, of the voles he receiv ed were oast by Democrats. Tbe vote on the 8 tats Ticket In this District will fairly show the relative atrsngth of parties, taking which, (the vote on Supreme Judge,) and tbe vote for Cooeress in eaob of the other Districts of the State, and we have a Demooratio majority of o,oo eonsiaeraoiy greater man onr average majority on the State ticket.

The Honse of Representatives has mads a bad beginning oi Its second session, In tabling tbe reaolution of Mr. Cox. It is evident that the salutary change whioh has overtaken public sentiment bas not yet reached Congress. Tbe system of arbitrary arreste In loyal States bas not any defender among the people. More over, it bas been virtually repudiated by the Ad ministration itself, and It remained tor tbe re assembling of Congress to discover backers for an outrage upon law and constitution, which has become a hissing and reproaoh throughout society.
