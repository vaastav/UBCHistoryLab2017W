FIGURE OUT THIS ONE SOMETHING THAT YOU PROBAB LY NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT— WHEN WILL IT OCCUR AGAIN Thursady, December 12, 1912, was the 12th month the 12th day and the 12th. year of the 20th century. In oth er words the date was written, as is the usual custom by business men, as 12-12-'12. Last year you were able to use three elevens in writing the day of the month, the month and year, for instance, ll-ll-'ll, which •was November 11, 1911. Likewise in 1910. Did it ever occur to you just when you will be able again to write the month, date and year, using fig ures all alike. You will not be able to do it next year, because we have no 13th month. We have not taken time to figure this out but will leave it to our readers. See what you can figure out of this and give us the results to publish. The astronomers tell us just about how long it will take .for the big comfets to make the rounds, but we are anxious to knoW when the calendar will revolve to this similarity, and on What date previously we were able to write the date in this manner. Come on with your calculation. MANY MINERS EMPLOYED COAL MINERS NUMBER NEARLY THREE—QUARTERS OF A MILLION The total number of men employed in the coal mines of the United States in 1911, according to the United States Geological Survey, was 722, 336, of whom 172, 585 were employed in the anthracite mines of Pennsylvania and 549,750 in the bituminous and lignite mines. The anthracite miners aver aged more working time than the bitu minous miners, working 246 days, against 211 days for the bituminous miners. The average production for each man employed was 524 tons in the anthracite mines—an exceptionally large tonage—and 738 tons in the bi tuminous mines. The average daily production for each man employed was 2.13 short tons in the anthracite and 3.50 tons in the bituminous mines. In most of the bituminous mines of the United States the 8-hour working day prevails. In 1911, out of a total of 549,750 employees in the bituminous coal mines, 330,045 worked in mines that were operated 8 hours a day 57,351 worked in mines that were op erated 9 hours a day, and 137,576 worked in mines operated 10 hours a day. The business of the railways for September while showing a consider able improvement over that of Sep tember, 1011, does not maintain the rate of increase set by the record breaking month of August The total net operating revenue of 00 per cent «f the steam railways increased $6, flMUMO for September, while for Aug ust was $13,066,022, NEW PARTY SPENT $665,500 Washington, Dec. 10.—The flaal statement of the contri butions to an expenditure from the progressive party's presidential campaign fund HI* ed with the clerk of the house yesterday, showed total contri butions of $676,672.72 and ex pendntures of $665,500. The list of contributors is a long one. SOME TIMELY SUGGESTIONS FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION ISSUES WARNING ABOUT CHRISTMAS DANGERS This office is in receipt of a bulletin from the National Fire Protection Association, which contains many valuable suggestions and warnings about the dangers of fires at Christ mas time, resulting from decorations of Christmas trees, and in stores, churches and at bazaars, and many other ways in which a dangerous fire may be started which so often results in loss of life and property. The sug gestion contained in- the bulletin are timely indeed. The bulletin says:—"Holiday 'fires in places filled with people are usually holocausts. Light, in fiamable decorations make fires easy to start and easy to spread. A match, an electric defect may do it. Do not make the slightest change in electric wiring without consulting the elec tric inspector. Before attempting any hasty or ill-advised decorations which may cause fire, examine your insurance policy and see if the policies contain anything like this:—'This en tire policy unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed hereon or add ed hereto, shall be void if the hazard is increased by any means within the control or knowledge of the insured.' If you burn you want your.indemnity do nothing to impair your contract. ™rf Children Burned "Every year in America children are burned to death from Christmas can dles. Do not decorate your Christ mas tree with paper, cotton or any other inflamable material. Use me talic tinsel and other non-inflamable curely so that children in reaching for things cannot tip it over. Do not use cotton to represent snow. If you must have the snow effect use asbestos fibre. Do not permit the children to light, or relight the candles while par ents are not present. They may set fire to their clothing instead. The tree itself will burn when needles have be come dry. Do not leave matches within reach of children at holiday time. Candles are to be lighted and if the children can get hold of matches they will experiment. They imitate their elders. A house of merriment is better than a house of mourning."

TOWNSITES OF NO VALUE FOXHOLM MAN SAYS LAND WILL BE OF NO VALUE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS Minot, N. D., Dec 9.—That the boom in western Canada in destined to mean ruin to many of the inves tors who have bought real estate in the various Canadian cities, is the opinion of J. W. Swennes of Flaxton, who is in Minot today. Mr. Swennes declares that many of the cities where land has been sold on a large scale will not grow to the point where the suburban lots will be of any value for nearly a hundred years. In the meantime those who can not afford to keep their holdings for that length of time will find them selves in bad shape financially, ac cording to Mr. Swennes. A company of real merit, scenic equipment unsurpassed by any com pany travelling and a play simple in story and pare in sentiment are some 0f the features of "Along the Ken- nebeC» THIS MARKET IS IN AND THAT TOTAL WILL BE BETWEEN TWO AND ONE HALF AND THREE .ION BUSHELS FOR YEAR— That Williston is one of the largest primary grain markets in the North west there is little doubt. Figures ob tained from the local elevators and grain men establish this fact. Nearly A Million. Up to Wednesday at noon nearly one million bushels of grain had been marketed at Williston out of the past summers crop, and the grain still con continues to pour in by the dozens of wagon loads. When asked for an es timate as to how much of the total crop had been marketed here the grain men all expressed an opinion that on ly about one third has been brought in and sold in the local markets. Reach Three Million. These statements would indicate that from two and a half to three mil lion bushels will be the amount to be marketed here this year. The eleva tor men say. that very little grain has been brought in from McKenzie coun ty across the river about fifteen per cent from this source .As soon as the river closes up this grain, will begin to pour in rapidly to the Williston market. Loading Cars. So far little trouble from car short age has been exeprienced. On one or two occassions the elevators were blocked but generally they have been able to handle the large business. Cars were being Loade-1 at all the elevators the newest big success which 1 will be seen at Gates opera house on Decmber 14th. Th play and company have pleased and return dates have been solicited. Vast audiences wherever presented. A splendid feture of this season will be the introduction of some eleven character specialities. All special Hmrj is carried for the production thrdougheut A^rt, but the grain has been coming in about as fast as it can be loaded out. Once the elevators are full a car or so or even a half dozen cars make little impression. Railway officials say that to-date about 400 cars of grain have been shipped out. Totals So Far. Acording to figures obtained at the local elevators the totals to date are as follows: Mill Elevator 200,000 Farmers Elevator 120,000 City Elevator 52,000 Victor Elevator 62,000 Independent Elevator 126,000 Hanson Elevator 55,000 McCabe Bros. Elevator (Est).. 65,000 River Market 100,000 Total 780,000 The totals include all grain handled, flax, wheat and barley. Wednesday wheat and flax were selling at the lowest mark touched this season. Wheat was quoted at 65 cents and fl^x at $1.01. The highest reported earlier in the fall was wheat 75 cents, and flax $1.51. This shows an average price of 70 cents for wheat, and $1.26 for flax during the past months. Reports from Minneapolis are to the effect that North Dakota wheat ia pouring into the markets at such a rate that storage capacities are taxed. The section of the state around Willis ton is certainly produueing its share. IMPROVEMENTS PRES. TAFT WANTS FLOODS PRE VENTED—WOULD OPPOSE ANY SCHEME NOT ADEQUATE.
