C. Lea of the Postoffice and Benjamin Ingouf of the Marshal's Office. A. C. Lea having qualified as required by law, has assumed charge of the Shreveport postoffice as the postmaster, being the successor of Mr. Steere, de ceased. As United States marshal Mr. Lea has acquired a knowledge of public business which will facilitate him in the management of the postoffice. Besides, he has an able assistant in Mr. Pretz. As is generally known, the appoint ment of Mr. Lea to the Shreveport postoffice created a vacancy which has been filled by Benjamin Ingouf, who is in every respect well qualified to fill this all-important position. His promotion from a deputy to the head of the mar shal's office in Shreveport is well de served. In these two officials Shreveport may be congratulated as well as the two gen tlemen who beyond a doubt will fulfill their duties faithfully and creditably. SERIOUS COMPLAINT Against the Union Depot-Sanitary Of years ago. Either the flush pipe of that (To the Caucasian) Homer, La., Dec. 3, igto.-Having for many years been so fortunate as to be a reader of your paper, and believing it to be ever for justice and right, I wish to lay an injustice before you. The wrong is the ladies waiting and toilet room in the Union Station of Shreeveport, La. I had occasion to spend several hours in that depot on November t6. I found the sanitary conditions very poor. Re turning five days later I found them worse. The weather was cool and the waiting room was close and stuffy, the only ventilation coming from the public waiting room. There was strong evi dence of tobacco and other unwholesome adors. In plain English the toilet was vile. There are two closets in that room. One s without a screen and was without two ficer Should Suppress the Evil. :loset was not in working order or else hose using the closet were ignorant of applying the flush, as the closet bowl had iot been emptied, apparently for some :ime. The stench from those closets not )nly pervaded the ladies waiting room )ut greeted us as we entered from the street. The bath was unclean and without a stopper. The toilet was without the mmuchlneeded mirror. It seems to me that in such an im )ortant station, where so much business s transacted, those numerous railroads hould be forced to keep a woman at endant. Now, I have not written this for pub ication. However, if you think it neces sary to print this for the good of my fellow women, then do so. I can, if you desire, furnish you with he names of other ladies of' my party who will, I am sure, testify to the un sanitary conditions of the station. X.

Minds crammed with matter and not having the remotest idea as to its value or use. Page after page is gone over and learned "by heart." Books gone through and laid aside. Scholars tired and yet how little do they know. The most simple, practical things of life they can not solve, are mere blanks and failures. Minds stuffed and crammed and yet can apply nothing. More teach ing-causing to know-is what is want ed, and let cramming, and there will be less worry, less fatigue, less friction and mote lit kearts, brilliant minds and wutss .in il SERIOUSLY INJURED J.

In the Grand Opera house Sunday af ternoon the Elks held their annual Me morial in the presence of a large gather ing of their friends. The musical numbers were rendered by Mrs. W. J.

L Pennington, exalted ruler, on the life of Joe Goff, and by F. G. Snyder on the life of Ben Sour. The roll of the dead, thirty-seven in number, was read by S. O. Williams. The "eleven o'clock toast" by Hon. W. A. Mabry was soulfully sympathetic and drew tears from many eyes. The oration was by Hon. Lewell C. Butler. "In Memoriam' was his theme. His tribute to the dead was splendid. His enunciation was clear and distinct and his words fell on ears receptive who gave the closest attention to his admir able address. These annual memorials by the Elks are always inspiring and lead to thoughts celestial. To review in words of love the friends gone before is not only appre ciative, but recalls the fellowship of the past which is linked with the hope of the future when there will be no partings and no tears. AUTOMOBILE ROAD TAX SUS PENDED. The collection of the road tax from owners of automobiles is being suspend ed until the Police Jury decrees if such a tax shall be required from the autoists. The plea is that these should be exempt as they are required to pay a license of $2.oo to the city. J. K. NORMAN Has Settled by Compromise the launagK Fixed Against Him. A few days since it was annotuncet that J. K. Norman of Oil City for kiss ing a widow had been assem>ed to pa $5oo. 'Thie suit against him was fot (2ooo. The statement in the first rep )rt was mild. It has developed that Nor man had insulted the widow, Mrs. Hun ter, of reputable character, and Ahe ha( resented his insinuation by slapping Iris face, and thereupon he assaulted her with his fists as if she were a man. His assault was brutal and cowardly. Through the widow's attorney . Scheen & Blanchard, Norman has settled by paying nearly the full amount of the damage assessed against him. It was the best that could be done, and under ex isting circumstances the widow and her attorney did well in getting what they did. DR. WARNER The Directions for His Funeral not Ob served-Excellent Suggestions. The True Democrat, published in St. Francisville, La., says: "'The death of Dr. Beverley E. War ner, rector of Trinity Church, New Or leans, suddenly on Sunday was a great blow to his church and to the civic in terests of New Orleans. Second to- no :hurchman in intellect and scholarly at ainments, he was above all things else, towever, the good citizen, and some of he most solid benefits that the city has secured were due to his iniatiative. "The letter of directions for his Funeral, written to Warren Kearny, a nember of his vestry, contains so much -hat is excellent in suggestion and ele ated in spirit and tone, that we can not forbear publishing it in full, as follows: "If I should die in or about New Or eans, I should like to be buried there. "I solemnly charge th e who shall lave charge of my burial put my body tway with the least expense possible. I lave seen so much extravagant waste itt :onnection with funerals that I shrink loth from the display and from the cx imple of putting under-ground what nught to be kept for the maintenance of he living. "I die a poor man, and all that I have peen able to gather should be husbanded or the support of my family, but if I were a rich man, I should still desire hat my funeral expenses should be at he lowest point needed for a decent in erment. "I wish nothing more than the service If the church to be read over me. Neith r at the hour of the funeral nor at any uture time do I wish memorial services tr addresses. Let my life be remem tered as long as people recall it natural y. If I have helped people, I thank ;od, but I do not want special addresses o be made to tell hte community of that. "My life has been the ordinary mix ure, I suppose, and I know that I have ccomplished far less than many people eem to think; I will know how little it as been by the. time these words are ead. I do not want additional cause or discomfiture in the other world, vhich would surely be mine (if I could :now of it) while a memorial service vas being conducted in this world. "I say this not without a deep appre iation of the many kindnesses I have eceived, but I know my own weak esses too well to be misled by the raise of those who do not. "I would like to have my funeral as hort a function as possible. For the ake of the living, and as an example or others, I charge my friends to drive s rapidly as possible from the church a the cemetery. I prefer that the horses hould not walk a step of the way. "I don't want a memorial in the church there I have served more than half of iy ministerial life. I have had experi nce in getting up memorials, and I on't want a soul on this earth ap roached for a dollar to perpetuate me. ks long as pecple remember me, their temories will be better than any formal ribute. When strangers come, they till not care, naturally, who was rector f Trinity from 5893 until-whcn ? "I die believing in the creeds I have sught, in the church at whose altars I ave ministered, in the sacraments I ave ministered and the prayers I have ifered. Most of all, in God, our Father i heaven, to whom I. pray for mercy as Smiserable sinner. B. W. "June 6, 1907. "And yet in the face of this simple but loquernt appeal for only decent essen ials, honorary pallbearers, resolutions, tc., were arranged for, so inseparable rOm pomp and circumstance is the torking of the average human mind in rranging for the last sad rites for ones o deeply loved and revered as Dr. War Cer."
