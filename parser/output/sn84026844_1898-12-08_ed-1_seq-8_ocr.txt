THE SIGNIFICANCE' Of President McKlnley'a Message to Congress. OUR FUTURE RESPONSIBILITY AS TO THE PHILIPPINES XND WHY HE POSTPONED DISCUScinv nil" THT5 STTflLIEf!T?Tl ATTWT cation or treat* looked for-the reform op the currency a vital matter to the country at large. work of! committee on uankino. -> NEW YORK, Dec. 7.?The Washington correspondent of the Journal o( Commerce says: There was some disappointment In Congress when It was J found that the President had postponed I the discussion of our future responslbll. ( j<f in PhllinnlnoR until li? should submit the treaty of peace. There Is oven some- doubt whether he will discuss the subject fully even at' that *!me. President McKlnley does not usually cross bridges until he comes to them, and thereby gets the benefit of all public discussion before taking a position. This in his purpose In regard to the policy of tho United States In the Philippines. He may decide to'submit his views regarding the moral obligation Imposed upon t^e United States In the premises and the commercial opportunities opening for them, which were recently*stated in these dispatches in his message transmitting ^he treaty of Paris, but he may decide to wait even longer until the treaty has made ?Ko phiiinnlnes a definite possession of the United States. The President looks for the ratification of the treaty as submttcd by the American commissioners. He has intimated to one or two senators, however, that It might not be fatal to ratify with some amendments if public opinion Seemed to justify it. The amendment suggested was that the United States should take the Island of Luzon only and reduce the compensation to Spain in corresponding proportion. The President will stand as firmly as possible for the ratification of the entice treaty and t may prefer an extra session of Congress | rather than see it fall, dui ir tne senate should adopt such an amendment he would submit it to the Spanish government without considering the action of the senate as an affront to the administration. The recommendations of the President regarding the reform of the currency are very gratifying to the promoters of the Indianapolis movement. The President does not undertake to outline a complete measure of currency reform, but he declares flatly for the three fundamental propositions of the monetary commission, the establishment of the gold standard by law. the protection of the treasury from gold raids, and the Issue oC an elastic ra;?er fttf mnntincr business demnndn. Representative Mitchell, of New York, who Introduced Jn th'o last Congress ;i bill Tor setting aside the sold reserve for the redemption of legal tender notes ar.d paying out the notes cnly In exchange for oold.' expressed much gratification that this recommendation had been repeated by the President and hid the approval of Secretary Gage. Mr. Mitchell desired to pass this measure at the last session, but yielded to the representations of those who favored more comprehensive legislation, and tv.is appointed on the sub-committee which framed the McCIeary bill because Chairman Walker recognized the fact that he was not wedded to any particular measure. It has not yet been determined by the promoters of the currency reform movement whether to ask consideration of the McCIeary bill at the present session or to bend their energies to obtain an extra session of the new Congress In the spring. Member? from the 0031 ana ihe middle west have generally come hack to Washington Impressed with the desire of ihe business community at home for some currency legislation. Man? of them declare that action should be taken if possible at the present session. Many of these and other members, who do not conBlder action essential at the present session, insist that there should be an extra session and that the Republican party will never have a better opportunity to prove the sincerity of its pledges and to place the monetary system upon a stable basis. The prospect of legislation by means of an extra session has been rapidly improving since the conference between Mr. H. H. Hanna and President McKinleir last week. The members of Congress who have reached Washing ("II l rum ciunt: uinuiviD( niKiiv ??v port of the business element was felt In saving the districts for sound money, are generally outspoken In favor of nn extra session. If It can be made short and harmonious. It has been the attitude of President McKinley and other Republican leaders from the beginning t'lat an extra session would be useless. There ivas some reasonable ground for the belief that the sound-money majority In both houses of the new Congress could agree upon an intelligent measure f"r the protection of the treasury from gold raids and the provision of an elastic paper currency. The suggestion of fIfri?r.il Henderson, of Iowa, that a similar course be pursued tr> thnt which resulted In th?" prompt action of the , hotirn on the Dingley bill, Is attracting 'i aeai or aircnuon. j nu bu^k-i.tlon r,r Ocner.'jl Henderson is that thnsf member* of the present conimitf ' on banking who will !) ' member* of Jf"- next house sot to work ut oncv to ure biirmonv upon, a bill aftd that they admit to their consultations member* ?,f th?* house who are likely to be on <hc committee In the next Congres*. It is possible thnt this plan will be broadened>.ao us to bring Into consulatat;on several of the house leaders who will not.be On the bank committee. It is believed that they can thrfsh over the ground of a conservative measure, which will go a rtood way a in -the direction desired by the admirers of currency legislation without causing any uneasiness among the friends of th.- present legal tender notes nor among those who bualneaa aaad*.

Buch an agreement would cut the session down to narrow limits In respect to time and enable the sound-money majority to put a measure on the statute books In time to be In successful operation when the demand .(or money arises next autumn for movement of the crops. The cordial promise given br President UcKiolgr to Mr. Hanna, and quoted by Mr. Hanna before the New York chamber of commerce, has materially cleared the air and given courage to ftf locrlatatlnn tuhn tnai?n#i thnf the old lacteal harmony In the committee and floor might be made the excuse Tor further postponement of action. The President has received a variety of advice on the subject and it is not surprising, even to the advocates of the action, that he has hesitated to summon Congress in extra session, without the certainty that the session wovjld prove productive KUl?d by Explosion of a Mint. 

BOSTON, Dec. 6.?Pour men1 were killed and several seriously injured at Fort Independence, on Castle island, In Boston harbor to-day by the explosion of a mine, which had been removed from th* channel by a diver. The dead: Sergeant Morris McGrath, Hiram Vaughn. Private Brennan, (a diver), ? Ryan, cltixen. The three men. Vaughn, Brennan and Ryan had plnced the mine on the team and started to take It to the place where the o^her ammunition was stored. The road along, which , they passed waa-unumrally smooth, having been constructed with a view to the necessity of care in transporting explosive material. Suddenly, and without warning, the mine burst. The horse and cart and the three men wen* blown to fragments. Sergeant McGratb was standing fully twenty feet away. He was Instantly killed by the concussion. His body doea not bear a mark of any kind. llaYnna's Unsanitary ComtlCnn. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.?Advices received in official quarters here from United States officials in Havana, dcpict the state of the Cuban capitol as filthy and unsanitary In an almost inconceivable degree. This is true especially of the poorer quarter of the whole city, und it is apparent that the task of cleaning up the city, is going to be of the greatest maimltude. Unfortunately the report* express the belief that frost will not come this season to relieve The situation. An illustration of the conditions there Is afforded by the fact quoted that the death rate per day in the suburbs of Guanabacoa now ?Quais the entire annual death rate. llo out Is to Dlamt. "WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.?The finding? of tho court of Inquiry concerning the abandonment of the Maria Teresa during the storm of October 29, were made public to-day.
