The Christmas decorations of the New Store are unusually elaborate this year and reflect great credit on the store.* clever decorator, Joseph L. Hall. The decorations are not only very elaborate within the ibig Nicollet avenue store but tha window displays and exterior decora tions are also very beautiful. Coming up or down Nioollet in th© evening, while still far away from the store, the eye catch.es glimpses of five great Christmas trees mounted on beauti ful white pillars on the curb in front of the store and fairly aglow "with many electric lights of all colors. The effect la very novel and attractive, and strange would it to© if ithe >big store were not al ways much observed. The big electric Bign bearing the words "New Store" also helps out the scene wonderfully, and there is much brilliancy in all. The windows of the New Store are models of attractiveness and beauty, there •being unusually fine displays of holiday goods of all lines. Three of the windows deserve special mention. In one window is shown "The Nativity" in a house made of handkerchiefs. 'The Virgin is looking over a cradle and a white angel is hov ering aibove. The suggestion andi execu tion is remarkaMy delicate and well done, and the window attracts much attention. Another window shows a beautiful dis play of jewelry under a greet arch, with dragon heads whose eyes and tongues are in electric lights. Still another window, purely decorative, shows a beautiful ser ies of white arches and 'beyond a fine per spective can ibe had of people going to church, the whole picture being brought out with a revolving wonder lamp, which flashes and shows many colors on the pretty scene. IA real live Santa Claus adds life to the window, and he is the center of much corament and delight from the crowds of young folks looking in. \ ;, The interlc<r of the New Store is cer tainly the rlace to catch the holiday spirit. Miles and miles of evergreen, are used in streamers, and every pillar is adorned with a Chrißtmas tree. Over the dress goods section is a fine oil painting of the Wise Men of the East, worshipping the Christ child. It is a (beautiful work of art. Every department 'has something a little out of the usual run of decora tions, and cleverness and good taste per vades everything in the matter of the store's holiday dress. From Ibasernemt to top floor, the store is full of holiday things and those who come only to visit and look on will find much to see and interest them. Evans, iMunzer, Pickerinig & Co. certainly have taken a lot of pains ito make their store attractive for their customers and they have made their place one of the Ibig sights on Nicollet avenue. ST.

The Minneapolis Arts and Crafts society has a sister or K uuiz:iti<>ii in Chicago that is now holding its annual exhibition. A visit to the exhibition inevitably suggested comparisons and it was a matter of much gratification that the work of the Minneapolis society in provid ing Interesting and educative exhibitions did not suffer in the comparison. The Chicago society now has lt£ workshop in the south tower of the Woman's temple and the exhibition, which continues through De cember, is held in the same place. It ia quite largely a local exhibition, the chief outside exhibitors being the Deerfield art craftsmen, who show a variety of interesting work in rugs, baskets and needlework. Tfie baskets and rugs are a comparatively re cent development at Deerfield and for that reason attracted much attention. The rugs are old-fashioned cotton rag carpet weave whose chief reeomniendatlin is that they are well made and In good colors and will wear. A few are striped fiut the majority are in plain colors. Another collection from Chicago of woven rag pieces are much more closely woven and have effective striped and geo metric patterns. These are chifley sofa pillow covers and portieres. 'lhe reed baskets from Deerfield are nearly all in the natural straw color and in a plain 6imple weave much like leghorn or panama hats. Originality was shown wholly in the form of the baskets. In the grass, raffia and rattan baskets . many of the patterns are elaborate and colors are used freely. Even the rattan has been colored and maidenhair fern stems, sweet grass and other fibres are used to give variety. Probably the most interesting piece of I needlework is a coat of Chinese satin designed and made by Bertha F. Howard, which is truly a work of art that is novel without be ing eccentric. The oriental tone is carried out harmoniously in every detail, although the cut of the garment is an approximation of the current modes. The material is a pur plish braid, brocaded in a small, diapered pattern. In trimming, wide blue black and gold bands are bordered by narrow mixed braids and the front is of fine handsome linen ornamented with a simple drawnwork pat tern. The silk cord lacings end In amethyst balls atid a oriental buckle gives the finish- CLUBS AND CHARITIES Club Calendar. FRIDAY— Mnemosyne club, Mre. B. A. Rose, 710 Sev enth street 3E, afternoon.

There are sample bedspreads exhibited by Berea college and the Deerfleld society, and the hitter shows a constantly increasing va riety in its novel needlework patterns, whioh now employ every color of the rainbow in ad aition to the simple blue and white with which the work begun. Home cross fltitch pat terns are Introduced and all of the work is highly reminiscent of the olden days in which needlework was the chief form of art expres sion of the gentlewoman. Metal work is always fascinating and the email collection contains some very attrac tive work in enamels and jeweling. Among the exhibitors of buckled, brooches, neck laces, pendants, boxes iand small dishes, are Mrs. Madeline Yale Wynne, Florence D. Koehler, Jane Carson, Jessie Luther, Isadore P. Taylor, Bertha L. Holden and Mabel Wil cox Luther. A repousse panel of copper, showing a Japanese fish, by Miss Holden, is beautiful in color, and a copper hood for a fireplace similarly treated, and a huge cop per jar to hold a palm, by Louise C. Ander son, are excellent pieces of work. Mrs. Wynne has some shopping bags in calf skin, with the hair left on, and in Persian embroidery. They draw up in box plaits at the top, the cords running through slits and fastening around a flat metal medallion. The fastenings at the ends of the cords are odd bits of carving. The china shows some fine pieces in con ventional all-over patterns in peculiarly soft colors. The shapes were simple, several be ing old t'avoritee with our grandmothers. The chief exhibitors are Lillie E. Cole, Helen M. Topping, Grace IH. Peck and Matilda Mid dleton.

APOLLO CLUB CONCERT The Apollo club gave its first concert of the season last night at the Lyceum theater be fore an audience made v? of most of the peo ple of prominence and cufture of the city. The club has always had a strong hold upon the leaders of society, who have given it their approval and patronage, and this year shows no change in this respect. There was especial interest in last night's concert, particularly for the musical people, from the fact tftat It was the first appearance of the club i nder the direction of Charles Graninger, who was given his formal wel come as a musician. He was warmly re ceived and his work strongly approved, for the chorus showed marked efficiency in its work. An excellent program was given with splrft. Signor Campanarl was received with great enthusiasm. The great barytone was not a stranger to his audience and his welcome was that of an old friend. He was in evctllent voice and sang with a spirit that was a de light. He sang in splendid dramatic style the prologue of "I Pagliacci," the beautiful "Christmas Song" by Ratolli, and from be hind the scenes the "Serenade" by Leva. He was called out for an encore and even this did not satisty the audience. He then seated himself at the piano and sang the dashing "Toreador" song from "Carmen," which is one of his famous achievements, playing his own accompaniment. With tfce club Signor Campanari gave the closing number of the program, "Lovely Woman Governs All.-" Miss Mac Louise Campbell has a soprano voice of high range and limpid quality and was well received. hSe sang "VillaneUe," and with the chorus "Jubilate Amen," which was one of the best numbers of tht; evening. The male chorus is always popular and did some good work on the program, inci dental solos being sung by local singers. The numbers were- arranged in pleasing contrast, the favorite being the arrangement of the Strauss waltz, "The Blue Danube." Mr. Graninger accompanied Ciguor Campanari, and H. S. Woodruff, as usual, furnished sat isfying accompaniments for the club. The house presented a brilliant appearance. The stadge was decorated with chrysanthe mums and polusettas, and handsome gowns, rich opera cloaks and jewels made the house glow with beauty aud color. The number from the younger sets present was noticeable and indicated that the seal of fashion hea been set unmistabably on music this season. There were numerous parties and the boxes and loges were filled with notables. Thf> promenade before the concert and the linger ing groups after the program suggested a re ception. Mrs. S. T. McKi.ight entertained in her box her guests, Mrs. D. R. Moon and Mrs. Por ter of Eau Claire. Mrs. Alice Rogers was hostess for a party of young women in the J. C. Young box, Her guests were Misses Clara Harrington, Effie Hughes, Helen Ken ney and Charlotte Esmond. Mrs. E. W. Run yaii had as her gueats, Mrs. W. P. Walker of Peorla, 111.; Mrs. W. F.
