Congress Urgently Called Upon to Reduce the Treasury Surplus. Our nesent Tariff Laws Character ized as Vicious, Inequitable Qnd'lllogoli The Repeal of the Internal Revenue Tax on Whisky and To bacco Opposed. To the Concre.s of the Unite 1 Motes Yon are confronted at the threshold of yow legislative duties with a condition of the na tional fnances which imperatively demands immediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually exacted, thioueh the operation of present laws, from the Industries ana necessities of th tiemdV inruaiv exceeds the sum necessary to meet the exi gencies of the Government. Wben we consider that the theor of nnr In. stitutions guarantees to every eitinn the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with onlv such iiinrtinn his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this la 

INDEFENSIBLE- EXTORTION, and a culpable betraval of A and justice. This wrong, inflicted uion ilk se who bear the burdon of national tn.va.finn iibA other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil conae. quences. The nublio treasure, whlnh ahoni.l fx'! f !HM,',U eonveylng the feopIe'S tribute to its leKitimate object! of expendi ture, becomes a hoarding-place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the peo ple's use, thus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, pre venting investment in productive enter rises, threatening financial dUturbarce, and in viting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our Treasury is not altogether new , uu iv nn more man once or late been submitted to the people's representatives ih the Congress, who alone can apply tho remedy. And yet the situation still continues, with aggra vated incidents, more than ever presnuina tin an. eial convulsions and widespread disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation booause its dangers are not now palpably imminent and apparent. They exint none tho less cortainly, and await the unforeseen, unexpected occasion wnui suddenly iney will be precipitated upon On tho 30th day of June. 1881. the excess of revenues over public expenditures, after coin plying with tho annu il requirement of the sinking fund act, was l7,8".l,73i.3i ; during the year ended June 3 PW i, snch excess amounted to fi!,405,ft4.'5.0, and during the year ended June n 167, it reached the sum of S5),5J7, 810.51. The annual contributions to tho si during the three ytars above specified, amount ing In the aft rotate tj M.is.n msi.'.u. ami dn. ducted from tho Hl.rjJus.as Utjdwer oiulal per corn, oomis oi in i udvi umtDt inuring wo six months pricr to Juue 3 J, 1887, the SURPLUS REVENUE bad grown so large by repeated accumulations, and it was feaiei the withdrawal or tins erem sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the country, that the sum of $7g,HtM,ioo of such surplus was ap- lied to the payment or the principal nu nterest of the tbree per cent, bonds still outstanding, and which were then pay able at the option of tie uovermneni. The precarious condition of financial affairs among tbe people still needing reiier, immocu atelv after the 30th dav of Juno. 18-47. the re mainder of the 3 per cent, tonds then outhtand ing, amounting, with principal and Interest, to tho sum of l,R77,.')lK were called in end ap plied to the sinking-fund cohtrihut on ror tue current fiscal year. Notwithst Hiding these op erations of the Treasury Deportment, represen tations of distress In business oircles not only continued but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. Iu those circumstances me contribution to the sinking-fund for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the expenditure of f7,rH4,i3.55 in the purchase of Government bonds not yet due bearing percent interest, the premium paid there 3n avnaxlng about '24 per cent, for ihe former and 8 per cent, for tbs tat ter. In addition to this, tho iutereft accruing during tho present year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the Government was to somewnat tncroane tnoir deposits. Whilo the expedients thus employed to re lease to the poople the mono lying idle In the treasury served to aveit Immediato danger, our surplus ravenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amount ng on the first day of December to 5 ,'2 H.701. l'., ui.d estimated to reach the sum of fl 11.00 V)) on tho uotbof June next, at which date it is expecU d that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in tae Treasury to $14 ', OOO.OlO. There seems to be no assurance that with such a withdrawal from use of the people's cir culating medium our business may not in the near future be subjected to the samo distress which was quite lately produced from tho same cause. And while the t unctions of our Nation al Treasury should be few and simpl". and while its best condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with pri vate business interests, vet when, by a perver sion of its purposes, it idly holds money useless ly fubtracted from the channels of tr.ule, there seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by tho Government to restore in an emergency, with out waste or extravagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted executive 

POWE3 OF RELIEF. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent bonds, which were payable at the option of the Gov ernment, has afforded a means for tho disburse ment of the excess of our revenues; but those bonds have all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to fie sinking fund wnich furnishes the occa sion for expenditure In the purchase of boi:a has been already made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In the present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing executive )ower to restore at this time any part of our surplus to the people by its expenditure, consists in the supposition that the Kerrctary of the Treasury may enter the market and purchase tne bonds of the Government not yet due at a rate of pre mium to be agreed upon. The onlv provision of law from which such a power could be derived Is found in an appropri ation bill passed a number of years ago ; and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as temporary, and limited in its application, in stead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority. Nooondition ought to exist which would justify the grant of power to a single official, upon bis judgment of its necessity, to withhold from or release to the busines4 of the people, in an nnusual manner, money held in the Treasury, and thus affect, at his will, the financial situation of the country; and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of the Treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested, and provided, as far as possible, with such checks and limitations as will define this official s right and discretion and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of PCnCBAHlNQ 

HONDM as a means of restoring to circulation the sur plus money accumulating in the Treasury, it should be borne In mind that premiums must, of cours, be paid upon such purchase, that there maybe a large part of these bonds held as Investments which cannot be purchased at any prloe, and that combinations among hold ers who are willing to soli may unreasonably enhance the cost of such bonds to the Govern ment. It has teen suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest, and the difference between the old and new security paid lu cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the Treasury. Tho success t this flan, it Is apparent, must depend upon the Toll ion of the holders of the present twnds ; and It is not entirely certain that thtt Inducement which must bf pffered (hem would rpfuit in 

GRAYLING, more financial benefit to the Gove nnaent than the purchase of Lends, while the letter roposal would redude the i r aipal of thsd ibt by actual payment. Instead of extending it. The proposition to deios t the niraey held by iu rovemment in Dan us tnrougncuttbe coun try for use by the people, is, it seems to me, EXCEEDINGLY OBJECTION ABLE In principle as establishlns too e'ose relation. snip between the operations of the Government treasury ana tne business of the country, and too extensive commingling of their money, thus ii'sienng au unnatural reliance In private busl ness npon publio tuuds. Il this scheme should be adopted it suould only be dona as a tempo rary expedient to nieot an urgent necessity. Legislative and executive effort should peuer- any oe iu me opposite direction and should have a tendency to divorce, as much aud as last as can saitiy be done, tho ri re usury De partment from private enterprise. Of course it it not expected that unnecessary and extravagant appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revrnue. Kuch expenditure, be sides the demoralisation of all lust contentions of publio duty which it entails, stimulates a uaou oi reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our poople or the high aud beneficent purposes of our Govern ment. 1 have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my oouutrymeu, as weii as fiuar&d-wttlTtiiereslKm relief, the OUAVITT OF OUll FINANCIAL SITUATION. Ihe failure of the Congress heretofore to pro le against the dangors which it was qu.te ev idont the very nature ot the dlfhcul y must necossarlly produce, o.iuaed a to.ditiou of financial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment whiob taxed to the utmodt all the authority and exped ents r ithiu xeou tiveoontrol, aud these spptar now to be ex hausted. If disaster results from the contin ued inaction of Congress, the resuonsibi itv must rest where it belongs. Though the situation tuus far considered is fraught with danger wnioh should be fully re alized, and l bough it presents features of wrong to the people as well as peril to the coun rry, it 1 but a result grow lug out uf a perfectly palpable and apparent chush, con stantly producing the same clarming circum- Btinoes a Congested Nltlonsl Trnamirir ami a depleted monetary condition lu the business of tne country, it need hardly be stated that, while the present situation uemands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of tho cause. 

BCHKMK OF TAXATION. Our scheme of taxation, bv this needless surplus Is tiken from the people and put into the publio troasury consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importation from abroad, and internal-revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of too icoo and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be oouceded that none of the things subjected to Internal revenue taxa tion are, strictly speaking, necessarlos : there appear to be no just oomplnint of this - toy sua consumers or tneso articles, and tliere seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any nort.on of the people. itut our rresent tariff lawr the Vicious, in equitable and illegal source of unnecessary tax at.on ought to be at once revised and amend ed. Thcso lams, as their prlmiry and p ain etTeot, raise the price to consume! s of all art. ties import! and subject to duty by prvi.eiy Ihi sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of tue duty incasur.s the tat paid by tnose who purchase for use these imported articles. Many cf these tilings, how ever, are raised or manufactured in our own country, aud tho duties now levied utv on foreign grains and products are called pro- luuuuu u muse noiiie muuuiuciuros, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed ar ticle and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imiortod goods that have paid customs duty. Ho it happeus that while comparatively a few usi tae Imported articles, millions of our i eople. hj never use and never saw any of tho imported i roducts, purchase and use things of the samo kind made in this country, and pay thero fir nearly or quite the same enharojd price which the duty adds to the imiortod articles Tuoso who buy inijicrts pay iho duty charged thereon lut tie publio irtssury, but Fist VuPl.VAirirakorl9'eViJf6,utV1.

FALSE PHILOSOPHY FOB FARMERS. The farmer aud the agriculturist who manu facture nothing, but who pay the increased price which the tariff imposes, upon every agri cultural implement, upon aa ne wears and upon all he uses, and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds aud such things as bis husbandry produce from the soil, is invited to am in maintaining the present situation, and he Is told that a hluh duty on imp jrted w ool ii necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the prloe of their wooi may oe increased, i ney, or course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no sneep is ujr mis scneino obiigou in tils pur chases ot clothing and woolen goods to pay a tribute to bis fellow farmer as weu is to ut manufacturer and xner- cbant: nor Is any. mention marie of the fact that the beep-owners themselves and tneir households must wear clothing and use other arUcles manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and tbus as consumers must return their share of this increased prioe t i the tradesman. 1 think it may be fairly assumod that a large proiKirtion of the sheep ownd by the farmers Jocks" nnmiVliiiVWVnr-iwenty.nvo to"f37Ey! The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is 10 cents each 1 er Hiind if of the vulne of .iu cents or less, and i i ceuts lr of the value of more- th m 3 J cents, if the liberal estimate of iixpaunds be allowed fir each fleece tue dsly then on would be tiO or VI ceuts, and this may Le tiken as the utmoit enhancement of its price to the farmer by roasou of this duty, eighteen dollars would tlus represent the incraatei prico of the wool fioiu tweaty-nve sheep, and that from the wool of fifty sheep, and at present values this addition would amount to abjut ouo-thiid of its pr.o j. If, upon its sale, the farmer receives tuis or a loss tarilf profit, thu wool leaves bis hands charged with pre cisely that sum, whl h, in all its changes, w ill no tiero to it until it reaches the consumer Wtion manufactured into cloth and other goods aud muterial for use, its cost is not only increas ed to tne extent of the farmer's tin iff profit, but a further sum Lai been added for tue bone tit of the manufactuier under the operation of other tuilff laws. In the meantime, the day ar rives wLen the farmer fiuds it necessary tj purchase woolen goods and material to tlotho himself and 'family for the winter. When be la.es the tradesman for that purpose be discov ers that he is ot liod nut only to return in the way of lucrousod prices, his tariff irolitonthe wool he sold, and which then perhaps lies be fore him iu manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meot a further increase in cost raused by a taiiff duty on the manufacture.

The taxation of lux uries i resents uo feature of hardship, but the necjssarios of life used and c uisumed by all tne i eople. the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should bo greatly cheapened. '1 Im radical reduction of the dntlas imposed on raw material usod in manufactures, or iti free importation, is of eotme an important fa tor in any effort to rednce the prico of these neciSHaiiis; it would not only relieve thoin from the Increased cost canto 1 by the tarilf on such material, but the inanufao.nred product, be ng thus cheapened, that 1 art of the tariff now laid upon such products as a compensa tion toour manufacturers for the prcs tnt price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Huch reduction, or frea importa tion, would serve beside to largely re duce the revenue. It Is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effeot uikjii our manufacturers. On the contrary, It would appear to give them a better chance In foreign markets with the manufacturer of oth er countries who cboapen their wares by free material. Thus our poople might have the op iNirtumty of extending their sales beyond the limits of home eonsumptlou saving them from the depression, int rrup ion in bualnesa, and lost caused by a glutted dome tio market, and affording their employes more certain and steady labor, with its resulting quiet and con tentment. lb- question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approac-hrd In a sririt higher than partisanship, and considered in the light of that regard for

Ohovkr Cleveland. W'ASfiixaTON, December 6, lt87i Hours of Labor in Russia. An inspecting committee of factorial exists in litissia, and this committed has lately published, sajs Iron, a re port "which contains some interesting data concerning the hours of labor in that country, taken from the inspection during the past year of 2,214 manufact uring establishments, representing 125 different branches of industry, i'rom the information tbus collected, it ap pears that a great difference exists be t ween the working hours at the various establishments, in the large majority of them men and women work equal time. The number of daily working one or two special cases, tinintejruptoa toil is prosecuted for the twenty-lour hours by relays. It is remarkable that these great divergencies in the number of working hours occur in the samo branches of industry, within the same inspector's district, and among estab lishments whose produce realizes tn same market price. A ainerence oc curs of from one to eleven hours in manufactories of the same nature. The probable cause of this is the extent of the works and the greater or less local demand for the articles produced. The longer hours aro, however, to bo found iu those establishments of primitive construction, and belonging to propri etors who are either ignorant of, or profess to be ignorant of, modern tech nical development. Night work is pur sued in 247 establishments, or 2U per cent of the total number, but princi pally in tho governments of Moscow and IaJimir. lne majority oi tne es tablishments open at 5 a. m. and close not later than 9 p. m. Those rep resent DOC, or 74. per cent, of the total number inspected, so that the law of June 1, 1882, for the protection of children, and fixing their maximum number of hours of day labor at from 5 a. m. to U p. m and of night labor at from 9 p. m. to 9 a. m., docs not affect them, any more than the law of June 3, 1885, by which female night labor is promuiieu in certain indus tries, notably the textile industry. A largo proportion of establishments (some 749) commence work only at C a. m., or even later, and in some cases as late as 10 a. m., and the hours of closing vary from 4 p. m. to 9 p. m. Crime in Ireland. The statistics for crime in Ireland for the year 188(1 show that the total number of criminal offenses was 223, 202. or 45G.5 per 10,000 of the esti mated population, as compared with 2:11,81?, or 4W.7 per 10,000 of the pop ulation in 188. showing a decrease of 8,111 in number, and a decrease of 18.2 in the rate per 10,000 persons. Of fenses not disposed of summarily con stituted tho more serious groups of crimes, and were somewhat more nu merous than in any of the three years immediately preceding, but snow a decrease of 3,291 as compared with the rear 1882. and the absolute number (7,:J15) or these onenscs ana ineir ra tio to the estimated population (15.0 rer 10.00U) were below the correspond ing average for the three years ending with 1881. The distribution of criminal offenses is ai follows: Leinster, 90, 911, or 910.8 per 10,000 population; Munster. 54.387. or 40-Ui: Ulster, i4, 257, or 311.3; and Connaught, 23,644, or 287.0. The total cost of the repres sion of crime for the year was 2,039, 02", being a decrease of 27,787 as compared with 1885. Of this sum 1,531.166 was for police, 55,473 for prosecutions, and the remainder for prisons, etc Notes of Ireland, It is said that the table upon which Generals Grant and Lee signed the famous paper at Appomattox Court house, which virtually terminated the rebellion, is now owned by a Mr. another, cf Chicago, who paid $1,000 for it.

Whether this ought or ought not to have boen done heretofore is a question which it would be useless now to discuss. It is sufficient for us to know that the financial con dition of the Government and the private business of the' people alike demand the prompt consideration of these subjects and the speedy enactment of some substantial measure of relief. Unfortunately, we are menaced by dangers from opposite directions. While a policy of non-action must inevitably re suit, sooner or later, in serious Injury to the country, we cannot be unmindful of tho fact that hasty and inconsiderate legislation on subjects more or less af fecting large financial and Industrial interests might produce, temporarily at least, dis- up under our present system of taxation ought not to be rudely disturbed by sudden and rod leal changes in the .policy to which they have adjusted themselves ; but tne just aemanas ox an overtaxed people and the obvious require ments of the financial situation cannot be en tirely ignored without seriously imperiling much greater and more widely extended inter ests than any that could possibly be injuriously are tod hy a modorate and reasonable reauo- Nothino was done in either the Senate or House of Representatives on the Ctb Inst, be yond receiving and reading the President's message.
