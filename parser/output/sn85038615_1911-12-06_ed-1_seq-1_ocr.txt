TAFTS MESSAGE Stands Firmly by Act as Interpreted by Su? preme Court. BUSINESS MUST STAY WITHIN PALE Suggestion Made That Federal Incorporation Law and Supple? mental Legislation Be En? acted by Congress?Big Bus? iness Done Legally Should Not Be Disturbed. Washington. December ">.?President Taft's message on the trusts was read In both branches of CongrcsH to-day. and wns generally well received. The President's objection to repeal of the Sherman iaw was approved by s-mo of the leaders on both sides, al? though the Democrats held that his first message should have dealt with the tariff. Democratic Leader Under? wood said the President and the ad? ministration were trying to over? shadow the tariff with trust Issues. "The message Is an able one from the President's standpoint," said Sir. Underwood, "but we feel that the lead? ing message should have dealt with the tariff. There seems to be an ef? fort on the part of the President and the administration to force trust Is kuos ahead. ! am opposed to a repeal of f c Sherman law. but there may be tuppleincntal legislation to define lt. i do not think the House favors a Federal incorporation act." Speaker Clark said he could not dis? cuss the message until he had studied It thoroughly. Republican Leader Mann, who has riot always agreed with the President, jiral* d the message. "11 Is probably the strongest ut? terance President Taft has ever mode." he nald. "it shows that hr is on the Kitte of the people, that he Is not con? trail-d by the trusts and that he does not wish to cause undue violence to ji -oprr combinations of capltnl." In the House, the reading of the message was Interrupted by applause fi.-in the Republican side. Defrnd* Phermnn Act. The President defended tho Sherman ec.. us Interpolated by the Supreme '.'ourt of t.h<- United States. Indicated I'lainly his opposition to the repeal or amendment of this statute. ,but sug? gested that Congress pass a Federal Incorporation law and Hiipplemcntal legislation that "would describe and denounce methods of competition that are unfair." To supervise corporations chartered under Federal law, President Taft pro? posed the creation of an executive bureau or commission, with powers akin to those of the Interstate Com mere i Commission. Speaking of tho much discussed dls solution of the tobacco truBl, the Pres? ident declared that In his opinion "not in the history of American law has a decre more effective for such a pur pone been entered by a court." Portions of his message of January, 1DI0, proposing Federal Incorporation, were referred to in this message. "1 renew," continued the President, ?'the recommendations of the enact? ment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of corpora? tions to engage in trade and commerce among the States and with foreign na? tions, it is even more manifest how than It was then that the denunciation of conspiracies In restraint of trade whould not, and does not, mean the de? nial of organizations large onough to be intrusted with our Interstate or foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than It was then that t>. purely negative statute likte the anti? trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate na? tional and foreign commerce." ' The .supplemental legislation the President desires. Is explained in a paragraph. "The attempt and purpose to suppress it competitor by undersell Ing him at a price so unprofitable as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are re? quired to give up associations with other manufacturers and numerous kindred methods for stifling competi? tion and effecting monopoly, should be described with sufficient accuracy In' a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten its task by prosecuting single misde? meanors inpteud of an entire con? spiracy, and. on the other hand*, to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community what must be avoided." Should lie Rigid Rules. Mr. Taft did not attempt to set forth the details of. the Federal Incorpo? ration act he recommended, bin sug? gested that combinations of capital allowed to become federal corpora? tions should be subject to rigid rules as to organization and procedure. In? cluding effective publicity, and to the "closest supervision" as to stock and liond Issues by the proposed execu? tive bureau or commission In the Com? merce and Labor Department. Federnl incorporation, the President declared, would not exempt any concern or its officers from prosecution under the Sherman act for Illegal acts. Such an act could be framed so as to prevent "vexatious and unnecessary invaaion by the States." but yet permit control by the Stales with respect to purely local business. The courts should bo empowered, the President' said, to in? voke "the aid of the Bureau of Cor? porations in determining the suitable reorganization of corporations dis? solved by decrees. This work, he pointed out, might be Intrusted to the proposed supervisor:- commission, ?which "should he an executive trl <Coutinucd on Seventh Page)-" Citizens' Committee Will Ask Aldermen for Amendments.

Should the amendments fall, the advocates will fall In and use every effort to get the substitute ordinance through the Boar*!, making a clean sweep of the city's business affairs and going as far toward commission government as Is possible under the State Constitution. If amended by striking out those three boards, the paper will have to go back to the Common Council for con? currence in the amendments, and as the Council Is almost unanimously on record as favoring an administrative board, favorable action there is re? garded as reasonablj certain.

At a meeting of the board of direc? tors of the Business Men's Club last n'jht. the members unanimously in? dorsed the action taken by members of the special committee In standing on the report as origlnaly Introduced, not Interfering at this time with the Fire, Police and Health Boards. Pres? ident N. D. Hills was directed to ap? point committees by wards to inter vl w the various Aldermen, and the club membership pledges Itself to back up the original proposition. in every circle the situation was being ranvasscd yesterday, and while practically all those Interested In the ehangen agree that the unification of all departments under one paid board is the ultimate goal, and will un? doubtedly be reached, there was divi? sion ns to the expediency of attempt? ing so sweeping a change nt one move. Th-? critical* hIoko In the Inaugura? tion rjf the plan would lie in the first election, when five men are to be chosen?later, but one at time Is to I be elected. It has men pointed out t at In this first election certain Is? sues might fie injected?for instance, some elements might centre on men In .11 ed to what Is known as n "wide open" town, while a reform clement might throw Its entire strength to men who would be aggressive In enforce? ment of Sunday closing and simllnr 1: s. hut who at the same time might not have the business ability needed fcr s-> important a post. At the first election It Is especially desired that the attention of the voters be centred on securing business men of Integrity and ability, without the Injection of special issues. Later, when I the board Is in office and giving proof I of its ability, and when the plan oi 'election makrs the voters of the en? tire city centre r.n one man each year. It would, it la argued, be a simple mat? ter to transfer all police, fire and health problems to It. This feature was much ilis-cussed yesterday. Some Predictions. A hasty rrnvnss of those at the City Hall last night and of such members ' of the two branches of the Council as could l>e located, resulted in the pre? diction by some of the best known' political workers In the city that the four-ward plan would go through the board with {.evoral votes to spare, and without amendment; that it would be signed by the Mayor and put Into ef? fect at the spring election. It was also the consensus of opinion that the City Council is now overwhelmingly pledged to the establishment of an administra? tive board, practically oIoik the lines Indicated in the report of the special committee, the only point now nt issue being whether the Pireo boards shall be included. As to this point the prophets thought that while there wa.s a remote chance of the whole plan goipg through the Hoard of Aldermen at this time, the balance of probablH ties was of the lloard passing the reso? lution with amendments eliminating the Fire. Police and Health Depart? ments, and that the Council would practically without objection concur In tho amendments. An active canvass of the entire Roard of Aldermen Is In progress, com? mittees of the business men's organi? zations endeavoring to. find Just how each of the members stands as to the four-ward plan, as to the Hlrschberg plan" of 'administrative board, and ns to the committee's pUn of administra? tive board. WILSON ADMITS ASKING PENSION Feared to Trust to the Remuneration of Pol itics.

Md.. December r>.?Gover? nor Wood row Wilson, in a signed statement here to-night regarding tho story printed in a New York paper to? day to t:;c effect thut he had applied to the Carnegie Foundation for a pen? sion, admitted that he had made such application before his election as Gov? ernor of New Jersey. The Governor justified hl.? action, however, on the* grounds of long service as a teacher: that he had no private means to de? pend upon, and that "a man who goes Into politics bound by the principles of honor puts hi.i family and all who may be dependent upon him for sup? port at the mercy of any Incalculable turn of tho wheel of fortune." The statement follows "The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Is not a plan for old age pensions, but for tho granting of retiring allowances on the ground of length and quality of ser? vice. Before I was elected Governor of New Jersey, when I had Just en? tered the uncertain field of polities. I applied to the foundation for a retiring allowance, to which I understood my? self to be entitled under the rules adopted by its trustees. I have no private means to depend upon. A man who goes Into politics bound by the principles of honor puts his family and ail who may be dependent upon him for support at the mercy of any incal? culable turn of the wheel of fortune, and I felt entirely justified In seeking to provide against such risks, particu? larly when I was applying for what l supposed myself entitled to by right of long .?ervlrc as a teacher under the rnle-s of the foundation, and not by favor. "I understood that upon the receipt of my application the executive com? mittee of the trustees of the founda? tion restricted the Interpretation of their rule and declined to grant tha allowance. Why the matter should have come up again now I do not know. I have had nothing to do with It since the early autumn of 1910. I have not renewed the application." Hin Application Denied. New York.

Censures President and Secre? tary of ?tate for Secret Use of Funds. HE ALLEGES THEIR MISUSE Says "Only God and Little White House Crowd Know" Where- Money Went. Washington, December 5.?Criticism of the President and Secretary of State for their Interpretation of the statute governing the secret fund for the State Department was mnde by Roprcscnt.i- I live "Ramlln^ of, Missouri, in a speech In the House to-day. Mr. Hnmlln is chairman of the Committee on State Department Expenditures, which has been making an Investigation of this matter. In six years, said Mr. Hamlin, de? partment officials had expended secret? ly $732,SSI, averaging $122.000 a year, when the secret fund' appropriated for such a purpose was only $00.000 a year. He called upon the House to amend the statute to prevent the fund becom? ing "the very haven of official piracy." Urges Passage of Ilia BUI. As a remedy, Mr. Hamllti urged Iht passage of his bill to create a Joint I committee of throe Senators and three ; Representatives, to whom the Presl- , , dent shall make an Itemized report on l the first of each December on expendl | lures of tlio money given him for the preceding fiscal year for 'emergencies arising In the diplomatic and consular service." The bill makes misuse of the fund high crime and misdemeanor, and an Impenehaule offense. "I have found enough out about this secret fund," declared Mr. ITamlln. "to make me anxious to know how many thousand dollars have been expended each year on portraits, pleasure trips, dollar diplomacy. Increased salaries and other things that Congress never contcmpluted should be paid from the 3ccrel fund. "I^tst year," he said, "we spent nearly $200,000 when there were no ' j war clouds on the horizon. The Presl- I I dent, bearing the olive branch in one hnnd. with the other was pulling out ; the money from the Treasury at the I rate of $483 a day. Including Sundays, j I We are toll" the money went for secret i ] purposes, but where It went only God ; Land the little, crowd at the White . House and State Department knows." i I "During the last six flscrl years." I he continued, "the State Department I has used money from eighteen funds , besides the emergency fund, and cover? ed the expenditures by a blanket certl- ; Acute of secrecy." How I'ntwin Are Used. Among the funds so used Mr. Hani lln mentioned contingent expenses of; foreign missions. International sels mologlcal association, international prlzo court conference at London, St. | .lohn's River litigation, celebration of 'disco, cry of Lake Champlalu, $10.000 1 spent from th Champlain fund to en- ' able this country to participate In the cole ration being covered by n secret | . voucher. Mr. Hamlin snld that If this money was actually used for that celobra- ' tion, "It probably went for railroad fare, hotel bills, automobile hire, ban- i quetlng, wine und the like. ".Yet,",' said he, "Instead of furnish-! Ing vouchers the President causes the Secretary of State to make a certifi? cate solemnly declaring that 'the na- i ture and object of this expenditure It is deemed Inexpedient to make known." This is a monstrous proposition freighted, with great dnngcr to the public treasury." He. said that such a construction would open a limitless Held "by which It would be possible to make this fund the very haven of official piracy." ?gro Is Lynched. Valllant, OUla..
