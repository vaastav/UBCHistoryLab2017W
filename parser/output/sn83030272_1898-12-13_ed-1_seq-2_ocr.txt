The Nlcarnituan Canal ' ft1 bill ran token up In tho Senate to-day, nnd Mr. , ( ji; Mortcon (Dem Ala.), In chareo of It, had tome ) , W modifications made In the arrangement of tho' V. UxU J ; p Mr, Tnrple IDrra., Ind.l, an adversary of tho i 1 bill, suggested the postponement of Ita consld- j oration until the first Monday In Janunrr, by ; which tlrao tho report of the Nlcaraguan Com- i ;f mission would havo been received ami filed, ; Mr. Morgan said that the presenco ot tho j, 11 commission's report wna not necessary for tho ' 1 remarks which ho proposal to submit to tho4 i r Benato to-ilny. and ho hopod to convlnco the ijh, Bonntotlint there was no occasion for delay for 1 f; action on tho bill. Ho would not go now Into a , dlsousslon of tho necessity for constructing a 1 . Nlcaraguan canal, for the country had como to 'L Ita own conclusion on that point. He hoped to Jj satisfy tho Benate that It would not bo wlso to 5 Allow this session to pass without somo action i having boon taken on the subject f Tbo general public, ho said, had an Incorrect S Impression ' as to tho real purport of tho bill, 1 I "i and It was his duty to put tho matter In such a f llsht that tlioro could be no further question as , t f to what was boing attempted to be dono. Tho fc 'J bill was an Amendment of tho charter ot Fob. j j 20, 1880, tbo right to mako such amendment ' sal being expressly reserved In that act. It tho j ,' proposed amendment suttod the Governments -1 i i of Nicaragua and Costa Itlca and the stock- ffit' holders and owners of tho concession (tho ' i" Maritime Canal Company), well and, good. If g It contained matters which they woro not will- ; .)- Ing to accept, and whlah thoy hud not ostopped j ffi? themselves from objootlnc to, what they had to 1 jBj do.wasto decline and to act on other lines of H1 legislation. But the United Btates Government j Wf bad committed Itself In the charter to an effort j 1L to carry into effect tho concession from Nlca- i K- ragua and Costa Rica. ,$!!! Nicaragua and Costa Rica evidently reoog- ' i , nirod tho universal opinion that the canal j j ?, across tho Isthmus must be under tho proteo- r" tlon and control and management of somo !rr Rreat maritime power. It was indlspensablo, in K tho viow which tho whole world took of tho 11 question, that some great Qovemment should L have the pocul(ar charge of that waterway. f" Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica recognized tho t- fact that a company chartered by one or both ( would not meet tho requirements ot the marl- time and commorcial countries of tho world. i- Under the treaty of 1808 with Nicaragua the T ' United Btates had the right to send Its army Tr into that country to protect people and prop- L crty against usurpation, wrong or Injustice 1 " Suppose," said be, " that a canal has boon i' built there with whloh wo havo got no connoc- f tlon nt all built bv Nicaragua or Costa Rica, or by Franco or Great Britain and suppose that Mexico and Guatemala havo united for tho purposo of capturing tho canal or taking it into ; their possession, as we havo taken the Philip- ", pines, what Is the right ot tho United States V" t1nHaitinaA nlMiimD(nnHAa 4 TVV. n a li baS 'Is , J- obligation 1 It Is that we -will go thero nnd W j , protect tho canal against that Invasion : that we ;J will protoct the people and property of what- r Bl ', jvor nationality ngnlnst tho wrong which may 1 vKi be practiced on them. That la tho legal nttl- 3 , tuile which wo hold to-day by treaty with Nica- k I i ragua " i i u Mr. Morgan asked whether tho conditions of C U 8 the treaty of 1H08 (or 1807) wlth.Nlcaraguo l i was in conflict with tho Claton-Bufwer treaty l of,lK50. Tho latter treaty stipulated that 3? neither powor would orcct fortifications on tho V 5 line of the canal, but. In tho case relerred to, ! t would Uhlted Btates troops bo debarred from if h the right to fortlty themscUesngainstthecom- s ) 15 blnea armies of Mexico ami Guatemala? If i -1 the treaty ot 1808 wore n violation of the Clay- . : 9J ton-Bulwer treaty, then tho latter treaty had , Bono into thin air seven years bror; fonllrent ft,, Britain had In 1800 made a similar treaty with ?: , Nicaragua. 8o ho thought that tho question of '! I British intervention or British opposition In jjs the matter was a very rcmoto question. Ho m believed that If the seUSe'of tho Senate wero fr tSklP to-day. ihcBonoto would declare the I 'S Ciayton-Bulwer treaty nbrogatod-tho chief lit difficulty In tho way pr.dolng so bolng the ac- ' Ijj tlon of Mr. t:ieelandIu' withdrawing from tho Ji f benntp tho Irellnphuysen Cavallos treaty as a V J? violation of tho Cloyton-Bulwer treaty. J .The V,niil,,C 'lll.-ho doclarpd. was a bill to I C; strengthen the hands oMho United States In if dealing with tho canal question. It was a hill I t which declared that that method of legislation Ji was not In conflict with the Ciayton-Bulwer f fe. treaty. It did not declare that the Clayton- R.l- Bulwcr treaty was dnfunct or obsolete. It 't r i" merqly declared. In effect, that there was no tl P.rqlBlonlnthetiilllnconflietwIthtbeClayton- fc II Bulwcrtreaty. ButthoeommlttOo. in report- I l ins this bill, did not propose to encounter tho i Is Bulner treaty ns an antugonlst. The commit- i " I too took the ground that the bill was a bill to ' f execute the Clayton-Rulwor treaty, and not to ! conflict with It. I it , Mr. Bacon Ipem..

For the completion of the canal as thus authorized! Including the harbors at Grey town and Ilrlto. 

14O.0O0.0OO Is appropriated. It is furthor provided that In his negotia tions with Costa Rica and Nicaragua the rres Irtont is' authorized to guarantee the treo use of tho canal to ships of those States and ot , citizens belonglntrto them. , , . A meeting of tho Interstate aud Foieicn Compierce Committee will bo hold to-morrow, nt which the bill will bo considered. Mr. lien. , bum said that lis has not conferred with the 1 military or other authority as to the amount of land that should be acquired for canal pur- poses, but belle red that it should be what ' er was necessary. The Frellnshuysen treaty of 18M.'I provided for a strip twelvo , miles wide. However, he said, that could bs ; scttlod by the negotiators. i "My reason for lUslrlng to secure sover eignty oer the territory," Mr. Hepburn said, "is that I don't believe it wise for the United States to put $140,000,000 Into tho soil of those countries that wo.can't take out and over which wo will not havo. absolute control. I am In favor of paring those oonntrles'for sov ereign rlghtsHn-thfl esnal'oroperty. rather than giving IhS canal company from S11.000. 000 to 10.000.000 for franchises only. This proposition Ignores the. concessionaires en tirely, and proposes to deal direct with tho governments .interested." Senator Morgan, when Informed ot the terms of Mr. Hepburn's bill expressed his sur prise at their lenor. "Mr. Hepburn In an Intelligent man, nnd ha certainly must know that 'such a rchsmo Is Impossible of execution. Neither ot those countries." he said, "will barter its sovereignty over an inoh of territory. Thoy would con sider It an Insult for the President to make tho suggestion. The .Frellnghuyson treaty with .Nicaragua gave tho United States a right of way twelve njllos wide for canal purposes, but 'the sovereignty of tho State .was ex pressly reserved. The.' arrangement , was praotlcallr a lease. I, doubt that ar majority of Mr. Hepburn's oommlttee will approve their Chairman's proposition."- yojuiNATioxa or jtbe pobbidbs.t. i - .

The workmon began to ' wodge tho yacht up on hor oradlo at 0:30 o'olock, and an hour later, when tho special train of two parlor cars arrived, bearing Com I modore Morgan nnd his guests, on the scene, I all tho preliminaries were completed an'd the launching party at once repaired to th'o plat form that wns rosVrved for tho favored guests., "Ichrlston thoo Corsair," said Miss Louise' Morgan, tho second daughter of tho popular' Commodore, as the graceful vnoht began to move toward deopwater,atthee.imotlmsihat-' taring tho customary, bottlo of champagne. In cased In a largo bouquet of Amerlcan'Beauiy roseB, noross the sharp prow of the yaoht. The entire population of tho village augmented b,y 'several hundred guests from this city who bad journoyed to tho shipyard, cheered In unison as tho yacht began her descent toward tho water, and the din was augmented 'by tho hoarso scroatns that emanated from a dozen, steam vessels that were In tho offing. Among the guests on tho platform were: Commodore and lira. J. Pierpont Morgan, W. K. Vanderbllt, William Bockefellcr. 'Joieph'H. Choate, Chauneey M. Depew, Mr, and Mrs. 0. Oliver laelln, CoL-E.

Irving Cox and 'other oxpertawere enthusiastic over the lines and unusually well-finished workmanship i of tho-new yacht., "lt.wos the most successful launch 1 have over witnessed, and tho yacht Is a beauty," said 'Commodore Kane to the re porter of Tns Sun )as tho yacht slid down tho well-greasod ways. Secretary J, V. B. Odd lo ,or the Now York Yacht Club echoed the opinion of the Chairman of tho Regatta Committee of that olub. Designer Cox was loud in his praises of the noworaft. "It Is the prettiest yacht that has evor been launched In this country." said he. ' The design Is as near perfect as anything I havo soon. and. tho workmanship Is all that could bo desired." Nothing except tho hull was sentovorboard. and tho craft floated fullyslx'feot above her designed water lino when she wns water-borno. She floated nearly over to thoBastorn bank of the river before being nicked un bv tho tuir E. C. Baker, which wont after her and eventually warped hor In alongsldo of tho pier. Then Commodore Morgan and his frionds climbed aboard nnd inspected tho Interior of tho ornft. In designing the Corsair J. Beavor Webb has closoly .followed tho principal lines of tho soc ond Corsnlr. which Is better known to the pub llo as tho gunboat Gloucester. Hor bow.'how ever. does not appear to be ns rakish or as yachty as that of hor noted namesake, and, owing to hor Increased length, tho stern has not the same graceful overhang that char acterized tho craft that Commodore Mor gnn sold to tho United States Government, he Is fitted with bilge keels, eighteen Inches wldeamldshlps.that run atrlllomoro than one third of hor entire length. Her ontranco nt the designed water line is carried out In lines that are slightly convex nnd extend uft almost to the beginning of the bjlgo keels. Her floors nt the midship section rise at an angle of about 3() from the keol, and only for tho bllgo keels she would roll badly In n seaway. The after lines of tho yacht are carried out in swooping curves. Tho design alt follows closely tho con tour of tho second Corsair, with the exception of a slight concave formation In tho profllo of thecounter. v The now yacht's sheer lino Is perfect from the point of view of an artist, and, with the ad dition of along bowsprit und two pole masts. Blip will compare favorably with tho best Eng lish vcssoln. Designer Wobb has followed the Idea that he found successful In the Sovereign br leaving tho lower end or tho rudder post without a stay or brace of any sort, so that the twin screw can havo plenty of room to turnover in solid water. 'To this end ho has spread tha channels In which tho shaft revolves fully nvo feet on each sldo of tho keel lino. Tho Corsair Is built entirely of stool, with plates worked In flush nboo tho water lino. Her Interior arrangements consist of ten state rooms, n library, six bathroom and n dining saloon on tho lowor deck. On tho main dock, arrangements have beon madn for a deck saloon, aalloy. chartroom nnd deck stateroom, with officers' nnd crews quarters forward, whllo the boxes, storerooms, Ac nro arranged In the forward hold. HcrprinclDal dimensions ft? dSB ened by Webb are: 302 feet ovor nil. 252 feet on tho water line, 3.1 feet 3 Inches ex treme beam. 20 feet U Inches depth of hold, nnd 14 feet 0 Inches draught. She will bo eauippod with two triple axcanslon engines, and steam wl be furnished by two doublo-ond Scotch boilers. Tho craft will also hate a completo electric plant in duplicate for llghtlngand other purposes. She will carry three launches, one lifeboat, pno gig and one cutter on aavlts. Rho is classed 100 Al. United States standard. Tho yacht will be towod to the Flotchor works In Hobokon. where her boilers and engines will be put Into place nnd woodwork finished. Her deckhouses are of calvanbed iron and will bo covered Inside and out with mahogany trim mings, and waterways and rails of teak. 1Jr'!J!,r!lS,nt that was launched yesterday is tho third Corsair that was built for Commodore Morgan. Theflrst was constructed at tho Cramps' yard. Philadelphia. In 1880. She was afterward, rechristenea Kanapaha. The seo "nd Corsair, which was from designs by Beavor Webb. In April. 1801. afterward transformed , Into a gunboat, renamed the Gloucester, did excellent work on the Santiago blockade. Bho was mado by NcofiV k Lory, and lengthened by tho samo firm In 1803. Ynchtemen In Executive Seaalon. Charles T. Plerco of tno Rlvorslde Yacht Club , presided at the meeting of the Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound, held at tho Windsor Hotel Inst evening. The object of the session was to discuss the scheme of restric tions as to scantling construction for all classes of yachts 30 foet racing length and under to the end or establishing cruising classes as dis tinct from racing classes. Tho report, as sub mitted by the Executive Committee, was a voluminous one. rehearsing in detail tho dlf rerencos between the regular classes, which for convenience were termed "cruisers" nnd tho racing-machines pure and simple. The gJrtli rule which was recently recom mendeTby tho Yacht Racing Union of North America was rejected for nil classes below tho .14-footors. for the reason that It was round not to be acceptable for smaller .yachts, and Ita adoption would involve much labor In the re ineasuremont of existing boats.

VEST TALKS AOAINHT COtONZBS. He Bays W Save Ha Bight to Acqnlre Ter ritory and Govern It ns a Colony, TTAiniKororT, Deo. 13. Tho resolution In troducedlln the Senate last week by Mr. Vest (Dern-. Jto.), deolarlng that theretls no power tinder the Oonstltutlohlto acquire territory to bo hetd arid governed permanently aa colonies, was taken np to-day, and Mr. Vest addressed tho Senate. He said It seemed to him peculiarly appropriate at this time to examine what was the power ot Congress In regard to the acqui sition and government of new territory, when thovMtorney-'General. the great law .officer ot theGovornment,dcolared publicly that tbo Con stitution, made for -tho thirteen half-rasaued colonics, had-grown too small for the greatest nation on the face' of .the earth. Mr. Tost quoted the dlotum ot the Supreme Court In the Dred Bcott decision, to the effect that no power had been, given to tho Govern ,mont to establish or maintain colonies, or to .enlarge the territory of Ulie United States, ex cept by 'thej admission ot new States; and he asserted that no tribunal Federal or Stato. 'and no 'public man of'emlnenco had over con tradicted thV.portion of the Dred Bcott i deci sion until' within-lbs last six months, when -the orate for expansion seemed to have taken possession of a very large portion ot the Amer ican peonle. Tbo fundamental principle ot the C6nstlt,ut)on was olUzenshlo to all Within' tho -Jurisdiction of-the'Oovomraent, except as to tho Indian tribes. But It had been said that that doctrlno had been abandoned by prece dent In the oases 'of the Northwestern Terrl tory, ceded by Virginia to the general Gov ernment, of Louisiana, of Florida and of Alas ka, no denied that-claim. In thoVnso of the Northwestern' Territory ,lt bad .been provided that, whon tha population rcaohed G.QOO thoy would have. a-riaht'to a Territorial Govern msnt.' In the act of tho cession ot-LoilIslana .from, France there vVasa provision that as soon a possible tho Inhabitants should bo . made cltircns -of the Unl'.ed Stales. There was a llko provision In tho act of cession of .Florida by Spain. When Ilussla ceded Alaska the samp, provision was put In tho, act of ces sion. Ho; cHaractorlaod as monstrous tho proposition now nut forward that Territories were not within tho soope ot the Constitution cf the United States, and that the Constitution spotted alone to the States ot tho Union. It was monstrous to'aasert'tnat the citizens ot a Terrltorr wereiunder tho 'Constllutlon, ox clndea fromi the bill ot rights and were at tho .merer of Congress without limitation. He had not controverted 'and should not propose to controvert the power otithe Federal) Govern ment to acquire, and covern torritory. but he did deny that territory could be acquired to betheld as colonies. I ",Wo are told" he continued, "thnt this coun try can do anything. Constitution or no Consti tution. Wo are a. great people, groat In wnr, 'great in peace ; but we are not greater than the people who onco conquored tho world, not with, long-rgnge guns and steel-clad ships; but with bnp short swords of; tho llomnn le gion and' tho .wooden 'galleys wblch sailed across the.

For myself. I would rather quit pnb llo llfo this minute nay. I would be willing to risk lire Itself rathor than glvo my consent io 'tats fantastic and wloked attempt to revo lutionize our Government and to substitute the the principles of our horeditary enemy for tho teachings ot Washington and his assoclato " When Mr.vyest closed his speech ho was asked by Mr. Piatt gtot.. ddnn.) whether ho desired action on his resolution. Mr.. "Vent suggested that It remalnion tho table, to be called up if any Senator desired to speak on It- . . Mr. Plntt I am not prepared to speak on 'the resolution to-day; but lest my silence should be misconstrued. I wish to say that I do not recognize the doctrine announced iu a dictum of the SuDreme Court or'the law as stated by the' Senator from Missouri. I.belleve that tho right to.acqulre torritory exists as an inherent right in the nation. That has been the doc trine of tho nation ever since the Louisiana treaty was ratified and oonflrmed. That right has no limitation either In the Constitution or elsewhere. It. wo are fighting a.war and ac quiring territory wo have not cot to eton as wo go along and to have -our armies -cease oper ations uutll there has:heen some declaration somewhere that -we are'golng to make States out ot the conquered territory. Mr. Hoar Does the Senator from Connecti cut olalm that we have a right, under tho Con stitution, permanently to govern subject o vassal States or peonle who havo no constitu tional lights of their own? - Mr. Piatt I believe that our power to gov ern any province, country or land wWch wo have the) right to acquire Is full and plenary and Is given by that clnuie of tno Constitution which says that Congress shall .have the right to make all needful rulos and regulations for the government of a Territory. , Mr. Hoar I do not propose to enter Into the dlesusston.pf the resolution at this timo. I understamutho Senator from Connecticut to avow the doctrine that, under the Constitution of the United States, and In conformity with Its provisions and principles, we have a right to govern permanently subject orvsssal peo Pleor races'without constitutional rights of their own. From that opinion I wish to ox press my ontlre dissent. Tho resolution remains on the Vice-President s table. Mr. Hoar presented petitions from citizens ot Concord, Mass., remonstrating against tho extension of American sovereignty to tho Philippine Islands -and against absorption of other foreign islands without previous consent of their peoplo. Other petitions on the same subject were presented by Mr. Hale (Berl.. Mo.). They wore ' all referred to the Committee on Foreign lie lations. Itepresentatlvo W. P. Hepburn of Iowa pro posed to the ilouso to-day tho form of a con stitutional amendment Intended to meet one ot the remote objections against the acquisition war.
