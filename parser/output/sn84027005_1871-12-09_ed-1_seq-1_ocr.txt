The New York Daily Bulletin-a com? mercial journal of high standing-in 1 publishing the report of the committee 1 of citizens, who recently "examined the ' books of the State Treasurer, at Colum? bia, ss far as practicable," says: ' -'WoBhall not venture to prejudge the accounts of tbe Financial Agent; but ' that ho should control such nu enormous j amount of bonds, and that nothing, should be known at the State Treasury respecting the naturo of his operations, the condition of his accounts, or tho ex t! tent to which he has involved the credit I pf the State, is a mutter which, to say ( tho least, demands the promptest remo-li dy. Mr. Kimpton's promised statement I1 should not bo delayed ono day; nor do" we Bee why it ueed be; and it is due to himself that he should invite, at once, BP full examination of his accounts by par- \ ties who would command public conti-! dence. The public very properly ask, how is', it that the State authorities know, or ! profess to know, so little of tho opora ! lions of tho New York agency, wheu alb tho debt operations have been conducted j4 through it? There is cither gross uo-jj gleet or something worse in this appa? rent ignorance; aud the publio can only!1, be expected to discredit the Statei officials until the mystery is cleared upi', and everything told. If people distrust ? the Government, and, as Governor Scott ' complains, tbo prim has protested and ' tbe peoplo have begun to mutter the| foul word "repudiation," what wonder, 4 ; when the most extraordinary irregulari-^ ties aro wrapt up in profound secrecy?! Until the Governor gives tbe publio a i1 f?ll and fair statement of everything, he!' C?n only expect to be distrusted, and all'1 who hold positions of financial trust!' und?r him. It appears, from the report of the com-!' mittee, that tbe Financial Agent has 1 "hypothecated $3,773,000 of bonds, * ngainst advances amounting to something' ! over 8900,0110; but, ou what aooouut this!! rooney was borrowed, they fail to show.' Their report states, relating to a summa-11 ry of the debt, which we give below: Is "In tbo above statement it will be ob-' ' served that tho sum ofS'203,000, already 1 referred to, has been deduct ed from the!' estimated debt of 1869; whether iii' should be so deducted must necessarily r depend upon tho report of the Financial" Agent. It is admitted that this amount ( of the debt has baen redeemed, but its'' fitiul position'in the account cannot now''' be ascertained with certainty." ; WP ?nderatapd this to imply that the'1 pommitteo wns unable to satisfy itself ol'1 tU?'iuo'orrectne*3 of a report current 1 hore that bouds received for redemption,'' orin tbe way of conversions, have been1' used as collateral for loans. Respecting!' tho $200,000 held in tho sinking fund,11 fatso deducted from Raid statement oil debt,) tbe report makes the darkly sog 1 gest j yo remark: I <?Tbia sum purports to bo on hand for the retirement of that amount of tho ex? isting debt. If tho whole of it or any portion has been ufced, (which can only appear by tho report of tbo Financial Agent,) tho amount so used becomes a portion of the floating debt." Thus, tho committeo suggest a grave, doubt that not only hus tho sinking fund!1 boen diverted from its proper use, bat Jj that retired bonds huvo been redstttled. ! What have tbe State officials to say to'1 these imputations? How long do tbcy! suppose tho bond-holders and tux-pay-!1 ern will keep their patienco undor the'] dark suspicious thus inevitably sng-! gested? Their reticence is naturally1! construed as an evidence of guilt; and . ?et Governor Scott, in au official bullo-1 tin, assumed an air of injured virtue! r The oommittoo deserve thunks for ! what they bavo done; but sonia explana-'1 tion is required of tbe reasons which ! prevented them from extending their ex? aminations to tho office of the Financial Agent, where only they could expect to] hud tbo information ubont which the!! publio are most conocrned. j I The Bey of Tunis recently seut Gen..! Grant "his cordial and friendly greet? ings." Whon informed of it, be imine* ! diatoly rang for tho White HOUHO stow-" ard. Upon tho appearance of that'! functionary, Gen. Grunt dr?w bim aside1 and nervously asked if ho bad received that cordial, how many cases thorn were,!' aud where ho stowed it. A tap on the" Chief Executive's shoulder by Gen,j Horace Porter, who wns present, how-'1 over, speedily rel laved tho steward from: embarrassment. 1 TUB PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.-The th i rd annual message/.of President Grant opens with a reiteration of the policy announced in his inaugural message. "The policy has heoa not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, hut to learn their spirit and intent, and to enforce them accordingly"-a senti? ment which, if literally adhered to, would preclude tho Executive from mak? ing many useful recommendations for the repeal or modification of laws found to be bud. Tho exceptional calamities by fire and flood which hare marked the past year, und which huve led to tho dis? play of so much active benevolence and generous sympathy ab homo and abroad, receive appropriate mention, while the year is recognized to have been, '.'under i wiso Providence, one of general pros? perity to tho nation." , , Under the heud of foreign relations, the couutry is properly congratulated apon tho beneficial tlleots likely to re? mit from the treaty of Washington, both UR u settlement of our differences with Great Britain, and an un example to the world bow wars may bo avoided without a eacrince of national, honor. Jredit is gives to our diplomatic aud consular agents nt Paris for the manner in which they have performed their do .icato duties without wounding tho sus? ceptibilities of Freuch or (lennans dur .ug tho trying scened iu France of thc past twelve mouths. Some surprise will doubtless be felt tc Iud M. Cutaoazy elevated to tho dignity if a national grievance, and tho puroly personal, difficulties between that obnox OUB euvoy und tho administration ni Washington deemed worthy of a place u the President's message. lu formet jases, such as those of citizen Genet luriug the administration of Washing on, and of Mr. Crampton, during th< Jriuieau war, it was tho violation of lav -athcr than bf personal.or diplomata properties, which incurred tho cenaun >f the Exeoutivo, and which was brough o the attention of the nation, liefer moe is made to thc diplomatic failure ii Joren, and to tho success achieved b; Vd m i ral Rodgers over u semi-barbarous jeople, and tho whole subject is lef "for such adieu us Congress may seo ? o take." The abolition of slavery' by Brazil i nade the subject ol' presidential nongra iulutiou, and the enactment by Congees >f u stringent law is recommended t 'each the casu of American citizens whe u their business dealings with planter iud others in countries whero slavery i itill tolerated by law, may become intel sated as mortgagees or otherwise in thi ipecies of property. Tho rumors whic lave been rife of pending difficult ie vith Spaiu, und possible Intervent ion i he affairs of Cuba, hud uo uouuteuauc n what is said iu the message upon thee leads. Turning from foreign to " dornest: kffdirs, the first and most important r< sommeudation of the inessago is, thi joth the tani! and internal laws bo m< lided, with a view to lightening tl lurdens at-present imposed upou tl jouutry. It is recom mended that "fi ?axes from internal reven uo sources I ibolished, except thuse collected fro ipirituous, vinous and malt liquors, t jacco iu its various forms, uud fro itampe," which amounts to a tacit r lornnieudation to abolish tho income ta [n any re-adjustment of tho tariff, it .ecommended that thone articles not pr luced at horne, but which enter lurge uto geoeral consumption through mei jinns, compounds, Sea., aud from whi ittle revenue is derived, should bo plac >u the free list, and that "should a ft .her r?duction bo deemed advisable, should bo made upon those artic! which can best bear it without distui .og home productiou or reducing t labors of American labor." Thia latt recommendation hus tho merit of bei io exceedingly general, that it prohal will give no offenoo uvou to tho nu irdent protectionists. For particuh ipou this hoad, Congress is referred -he report of the Secretory of the Tn lury. Tho fluctuations in the cu rr er ire deplored, and tho wisdom of Ce jreas ia invoked to find a remedy, whi s the nearest tho President comes ibo wing any coucern upou tho subject ipecie payments. The message rei rates the condemnation heretofore p jounced hy tho Secretary of tho Tr mry upoo the present infamous syst )f moieties to informers in the revei iervioe of tho country-a system whi while condemned iu theory, is said practice, however, lo flourish exec ugly. lu tho navy, the employment oi sar. lumerary officers iu tho merchant i tice, (as in Eugluod and other co ;rios.) uud that promotion ubovo rank of captain ho mudo by sulecti .?atead of seniority, (us ut prcHont,)si o be recommendations worthy the mention of CongresH. The plan of unit .ho telegraph service with tho ordiu postal service of tho county is ur j ipon tho favorable consideration of C tress, ns recommended by tho Postn :er-Geiieial. Tho revenues of tho ?artmeut continue to improve. Tho meuaures taken for tho cufo nout of tho Ku Klux law aro next viewed. The proclamation of Ootc 17 is justiiitid, upon tho ground that requirements of tho proclamation of ;ober 12, requiring tho members of awful combinations, within tivo dav mrrender "all their arms, ammunit luiforms, disguises, mid other means implements used by them for carr; jut their unlawful purposes-," hud been complied with, Tho existent the "unlawful combinations," " posea," "arms," "uniform" uud "iu menta" ia taken for grunted. "Ar or trial in the judicial tribunals of United States" ia promised tho pa who have been arrested, ia numbers t ll und reds, and wo may add, also, 1 conviction, inasmuch ns it is added: is believed that no innocent peru now in custody." If a "regular" tr to tako place, tito question of gui innocence, ono would havo .sappi might have been left to tho ..joel tribunals." A reign of terror ht been mungi)rated, tho fact that nun of persons havo "absconded" is uasi to bo "good ground for supposing ill such persons have violated thc lu The suppression ol polygamy in Utah, with a provision for tho legitimization oi "innooent children" np to a certain date, is suggested-the latter only "ns a sug? gestion, not a recommendation." The "peace policy" heretofore adopted by the administration with reference to the Indians, (though somewhat varied in practice by exploits like thoso of the "Fiegan" massaore,) ia recommended to be adhered to, "not only because it is ? humane, Christian-like and economical, I but because it is right." Political amnesty is recommended, upon the ground, apparently, that no good comes from excluding a particular I class of men from office, beoauso they had violated their oath to support the Constitution, while thousands who would havo done so had they been in the simo position, aro admitted to bo eligi? ble. It is added, "If there bo any great crimiuals distinguished abovo nil ol bor? for tho part they took in opposition to the Government, they might, iu the judgment of Congress, bo excluded from such amnesty." It is needless to re? mark that such amnesty would not be "general,", and that tho vcr}' "excep? tions" would go far to defeut its effect, llegret is expressed that tho old citizens of tbe Southern States should not tnko a moro prominent part in public affairs, but tbe causes which binder them from so doiug seem most imperfectly compro bended. Tbe wretched misrule of the carpct-bag governments of those States, uow upheld by Kn Klux legislation, bus far mo: a to do with their prescht "un? happy condition" than any feeling of personal hostility or "social ostracism" on tho part of the older iuhabitnnts to? ward thuBO who differ with them in po? litical sentiments. Natural causes, such as climate, Roil and the state of the labor question, with present mnl-admiuistra tion, have quito us much to do with re? tarding "immigration and tho flow of much-needed capital" into the South, ns any of tho causes which tho President enumerates. In conclusion, Ibo President declares himself in favor of such civil service re? form as will visit tho responsibility for bad appointments upon thoso who re? commend improper persons for oflWo to the appointing power. Ile refers to the commission appointed under tho Act of Congress of March 31, 1871, to devise regulations for tho reform of tho civil service, and promises to give to thc ex? periment a fair trial. Taken ns a whole, the message is of moderato length, eirnplo and uupreten? tious in its style, rather negativo than positive in its merits, and certainly less aggressive in its tonn and recommenda? tions than might havo been apprehend? ed, and porhups, by a certain elas-s ol political extremists and factioniatp, was desired.-Baltimore Sun.
