Theke are some Republicans who seem to have an idea that the Presiden tial campaign Is already on. Better turn off some of the pressure boys. You haven't fuel enough to keep it up three yeare. The Republican press should get to gether. One Republican editor says the new tariff bill discriminates agnlnst the south, while another says the Wil son bill is simply a sectional measure, favoring the south. Get your heads to gether, gentlemen. Chairman Wilson and his demo cratlc collengues on the House Ways and Means committee should consider the abuse they are getting from Re publicans because of the tariffbill, the very highest praise that could have been bestowed upon them. II is cer tainly regarded as such by all other good Democrats. Sugar should be on the free list, but a tariff bill that puts it there is not a tariff bill advocated by Democrats. New York Tribune, It was the Republicans who placed a tax upon sugar and also granting a bounty both outrages upon the cou sumers.. Democrats hare started to cutting off ths bounty and the tariff will be taken off iu time; Since' the Wilson tariff reform bill has been made public and President Cleveland sent his annual message to Congress, the Republican calamity claquers are making more noise than ver.

This country was Intended for others outside of a few Republicans bosses, rich corporations, and grinding mo nopolista. The President's Hewt. We lay before our reader this week the message of resident Cleveland. The document Is lenghty, but U wan ly, straightforward and easily under stood. As the document will be read by everybody, it Is useless to here go over nil it contains, but a few choice sayings will not be out of place. The president Is still Arm In his be lief that the tariff needs revision, and he heartily endorses the Wilson bill and counsels Its passage; he starts In on tariff revisl-m with a lecture on that problem, iu which he congratulates the country on the fact that the friends of tariff reform are at last at the helm. He then turns to congress and assures that body that "if there Is any thingiu the theory of a repre sentation In public places, of the peo ple and their desires, if public officers are really the servants of the people, and If political promises and profes sions have any binding force, our fail ure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. .Nothing should intervene to distract our atten tion or disturb our effort until this re form Is accomplished by wise and care ful legislation." As a legacy from the Republican ad ministration the following statements of Mr. Cleveland are pertiment. At this time when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged In a hard strug gle for the necessities of life and when enforced economy is pressing upon the irreat mass of your countrymen. 1 de sire to urge with all the earnestness at my command Iliac congressional legi luiion be so limited by strict economy as -to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the treasury and a sympa thy with the straitened circumstances of our fellow citizens. The duty of public economy is also of immense importance in lis intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet re ducing tho people's burden of federal tuxutiou. Indeed, it is true that no question is of such great Importance as the tarifl question at this time. Business is at a standstill, money lies Idle in our banks, workmen are anxiously waiting in idleuess at their homes, hoping and ex pecting that something will be done by which business will be resumed and prosperity come again. The pension question is dealt with fairly and honestly. In dwelling up on this matter the President says: "I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed aud corrected with thor oughness and vigor. Every name fraudently put upon these rolls, is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pensions have theirorigin; every fraudulent pension er lias become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension ha made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pensioners rob the people not only of their mouey, but of their patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war, fought for the pres ervation of the Union, ought to in spire. ' The thousands of neighborhood? have their well known fraudulent pen sioners, and recent developments b, tho bureau, establish appalling con spiracies' to accomplish pension frft'igg. By nonltaus uo lust wrong don is to brave ana deserving pensioner who certainly ought not to be con detuned to such associations. l'hosa who attempt, in the line 'of duty, to rectify these wrongs shoulo not be accused or enmity or ltidiiter- etice to the claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account oi pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893, was $150,740,407.14. The cntnmiMtloner estimates thai $105,000,000 will bo required to pay pensions during the year ending J uut 30, 1804." Got Vaccinated Quick. While not desiring to be considered an alarmist, Secretary Probst, of the State Board of Health,' believes that public attention should be called to the necessity for vaccination. "We have not had a general small pox scare in this country since 1881," said the Doctor, "aud the result is that very few of the children born since then have been vaccinated. There are lots or them ana an epidemic ot small-pox might carry many of them to their graves." Dr. Probst says there are seats of the epidemic now iu New York, Connecti cut, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio. Indiana, Illinois, fttinnesota, Kentucky and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania there are eight places where small-pox is epl detnlc, and in five of them the health authorities have been unable to dis cover its origin. This puts them at great disadvantage In trying to contro it and stamp it out. It was due largely to the inability of the State Board of Health of Ohio to discover the real origin of the disease at Akron last year that prevented prompt control of the epidemic there. The discovery of the origin of the epidemic at Knoxville and Nashville Tenn.. shows that the condition is alarming there. At the first-named place it has beeu traced to a man who cleans the railway cars, and at Louis ville, Ky., to a man who is employed in a laundry where the bedding of Pull man sleeping cars is washed. These facts are taken by Dr. Probst to show that the germs are scattered along the channel or travel in these states and there is no telling how many have been Infected. The lesson of the hour is that every one, and especially every parent, who have children that have not already been vaccinated, vaccinated at once The Wilson tariffbill is all right, notwithstanding the Republican howl against It. In fact, that howl is enough of Itself to convince any doubting Domocrat that the bill is all right. Bucklen's Arnica Salve, The best salve in the world for Cuts Bruises. Sores. Ulcers.

HAWAIIAN NEWS. HINISTER WILLIS AWAITING INSTRUC TIONS FROM WASHINGTON. tine Ilia Arrival New . Development Hare Hade It Necessary Far Illm to Ileur From Mr. Cleveland Before Pro ceeding to Carry Out Original Iiisiruc tiona It May lie Several Week. Port Townsknd. Wash.. Dee. B. The barkoutino Klichitat, Captain Cut ler, has just arrived from Honolulu with advices to Nov. 'JO, fonr days after the steamer Alameda sailed for Sun Francisco. In an interview published in the Honolulu Evening Star, Minister Willis is reported to have said: "You are authorized to state that no change in the present situation wil 1 take place for several weeks. I'brought with me certain instructions from the United States government on the Ha waiian situation. Since my arrival contingencies have arisen about which neither the United States government nor myself were aware when I left Washington. I have thought best to exercise the discretion allowed, and submit those matters to Washington before proceeding further to carry ont my original instructions. No one need fear trouble and no lawlessness will be permitted." This statement gave the annexation its much satisfaction, aud the royalists were much displeased. The? editor of The Evening Star re quested Minister Willis to submit a statement to tho public to allay the general feeling of uncertainty. In a published interview Mr. Willis said: "Yes. I believe that the time has come when it is right and proper for me ro use my discretion in this matter. You are authorized to say for me that no change in the prosent situation will take place for several weeks." Mr. Willis then made the statement quoted above and added: "1 forwarded my dispatches to Washington by today's steamer, and until I receive an answer to them no change will take place in the present situation, nor will any bo allowed." "What do yon mean by the expres sion 'nor will any be allowed?' " "I must say just this, that until the time comes for me to carry out my in structions the peace and good order of this coinmun ity will be kept undisturbed in the interests of humanity; that any attempt made by any parson or persons j to make trouble will be promptly checked and punished. "You may put ths matter more plain ly, and say that even if the provisional government discharged all its troops today no lawlessness would be allowed for one moment under the present situ ation of affairs. The whole Hawaiian question is now in abeyance, and noth ing that the newspapers can. Bay or do will alter the situation one iota. I make this statement on my own re sponsibility and in the hope that it will allay the present excitement. JNo one need fear trouble and o lawlessness will be permitted. After this statement rumors began to fly about that the queen's supporters would make a final rally in her behalf. The crews of the United States men-of-war Philadelphia and Adams were held in readiness to be landed on a moment's notice. The ouaen's advocate came out the next day with a denial of the Willis in terview, saying he was misquoted, and bv inference gave encouragement to the idea that Willis had or would re ceive an imperative order to restore the queen.

Officials of the Btate department have received no ad vices from Hawaii by the barkentine Klicklitat, which arrived at Port Town- send from Honolulu. They are inclined to discredit and question the accuracy of the purported interview witn minis ter Willis in tne tionoiuiu evening Star. They say that it would have been improper for Minister Willis to have thus expressed mmseir, ana tney do not believe he made the statements attributed to him. The president and the department ot state were evidently not expecting any news from Honolulu Tuesday morning, and the Associated .Press telegram, giv- inn news received by a vessel irom Honolulu, caused surprise. Secretary Gresham was engaged Tuesday morning with Justice Harlan, presumably on the Bearing sea negotiation, and would not ba seen. The impropriety of Minister Willis' expressing as lie was reported to have done bo was tne onty reason ad vanced by other officials for discredit ing the reported interview. OFF ON A

DOWN ON A TRESTLE- Lady Killed and Several People Injured at F.a.t Liverpool, O. East Liverpooi, O.. Dec. 2. A hor rifying accident, resulting in tho death of an estimable yonng lady and the in jury of a number of others, occurred on the electric street railway shortly be fore 1 o'clock Friday morning. About 20 Enst Liverpool people at tended a private party at the bouse of John Robinson, half way between the sity proper and the East End. Shortly after !!i o'clock the affair broke np. The party from the city hailed the next car westward, but was informed by the mo lornian that it would run only to the power bouse, a distance of a few blocks, und that his was the last car. The party then concluded to walk to town, and to do so had to pass over a trestle work, a distance of 100 feet. They anticipated no danger, despite the darkness, owing to the assurances of the motorman that there, would be no more cars. When half way across the trestle the party was horrified to see a car approaching from the east, down a heavy inciine, at a terrific speed. Their screams were heard by the mo torman, but he was unable to check the car. and it came thundering toward them. Some members of the party jumped over the trestle, a distance of about 13 feet, while others allowed themselves to drop through the tics. In the party were Mr. and Mrs. Mil ler J. Harsha, a young couple, married a little over a year ago, with their in fant babe. Mr. Harsha advised his wife to slip through the ties and acted upon this advice himself. With the baby in one arm he hung to the tie, urging his wife to make haste, but be fore she could follow him she was struck by the rapidly moving car and killed. A number of others were painfully but not dangerously injured. Out of 14 in the party all but three were more or less injured. SKYSCRAPERS AND EARTHQUAKES. A Chic:. Architect Hal Little Fear For Structure! of Steel. CniCAGO, Dec. 1. The earthquake shocks reported from Montreal, Albany and other eastern cities, have set the occupants of Chicago skyscrapers seri ously to thinking of what would prob ably be their fate if this section ex perienced a like seismic disturbance. Chicago architects, however, do not seem to feel any great apprehension as to the danger to Chicago's tall build ings from earthquake shocks, although they admit that tho quake at Montreal is bringing the matter pretty near home. "TThiie it is true that Chicago has some extremely high buildings," said an eminent architect in on interview, it must be remembered that these same buildings are constructed on a new style of architecture. They are built on skeleton frames of steel and iron and are riveted and screwed to gether from top to bottom. They could not be shaken to pieces, and could withstand any shock that was not great enough to topple them over completely. The real danger is m tne old cmia- ings, constructed on the old plan. They might rattle down, but none of them are very tail, and many or tnem are now being torn down and new style ones built in their stead. In California buildings are erected with earthquake anchors attached to steady the walls against shocks. I was in an earthquake in that stats four years axo, and it is not a pleasant experience. V hue tnere might be no danger to the occupants of ths tall buildings here in case of a shock, I would nevertheless prefer to be on the ground." INCOME TAX Will Probably Not Touch Personal Earn ings nt All. Washington, Dec. 2 .Congress meets next Monday and the president s mes sage will undoubtedly be one of the most important ever delivered to any congress. The silver question, the Hawaiian question, the tariff question and the income tax question will doubt less all claim much of the document. It is now Drettv well understood that the committee on wavs and means have prepared an income tax bill in aceord- ance with the president's views. Chair man Wilson says tne new tarin Din win leave the revenues about &,000,000 short, and Secretary Carlisle agrees with him in this estimate. 1 bis is to be made np by a tax, not on private earnings, but by making the levy on corporations, successions and legacies. The incoms tax will hi confined to these limits. Successions and legacies in this con ntctions apply only to personalty and inonevs. The Democrats of the com mittee have also debided to increase the tax on cigarettes and to impose a tax oa playing cards. Both of these points are definitely decided, the object, on the on hand, being to tax a "nuisance," and on the other to tax an article which can bear a heavy burden without any individual feeling the weight of it. The internal revenue tax on whisky is still an onen -.nestioru Cincinnati Is about to annex square milei of territory, adding 22,000 to its population.
