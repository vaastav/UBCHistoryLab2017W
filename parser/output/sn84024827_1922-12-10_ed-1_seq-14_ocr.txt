"Blood and Sand" at Eagle Today " "The Valley of Silent Men" A picture which combines magni ficent scenic beauty with a thrilling story i9 "The Valley of Silent Men," adapted from James Oliver Cur wood's famous novel of the same name, as a Cosmopolitan production and released by Paramount. Those familiar with the novel. Which ran serially in Good House keeping Magazine in 1920, will recall that it is a story of the Royal North West Mounted Police, with the Rocky Mountains for a background. It is a picture of tremendous power, baring as it does the souls of five men and a woman who are isolated in a little narrow valley. For the purpose of imparting' this realism to the screen, the entire com pany went to Banff, in the Canadian Rockies, and there practically every foot of the action was enacted and photographed. The result, apart from the dramatic value of the production, is a picture of unsurpassed scenic beauty. The picture, which was directed by Frank Borzage, and which features Alma Rubens at the head of a small but powerful cast, is coming to the Central theater Friday and Saturday, and to the Eagle theater next Sunday.

A Fred Niblo production made from the notable Vicente Blasco Ibanez novel of the same name That "Blood and Sand" might be correct in every respect, Palomar not only supervised the dressing of Valen tino in toreador costume, but taught him every step of the intricate evo lutions which mark the graceful sword and cape play of a matador. Although Valentino is a trained dancer, he found even more difficult than tango or mixixe the complicated Bteps Palomar taught him for two solid months. And accuracy was de cidedly essential for with a bull in front there's only one mistake tobe made, and when that occurs the undertaker has his inning. Rafael Palomar won, the training assignment because of his 12 years as a bull fighter in Madrid, Seville, Cadiz, Mexico City, Guadalajara and other Spanish and Spanish-American cities. He Is the brother of Jose and Francisco Palomar, equally famous as favorites of Spanish bull ring audiences. The hiring of Palomar was but a part of the plan to-make "Blood and Sand," which comes to the Eagle theater today and Monday correct in every, detail. The story, however,' tells of the life of Juan Gallardo, a bull fighter, rather than of bull fight ing. .

"My Dad" ia based upon the nobility of sacri fice. The son, played by Mr. Walker, risks his life, undergoes the tortures of numbing cold, the dangers of frozen trails to procure the evidence that proves his father innocent Puilt up to a smashing climax, in which is depicted one of the most thrilling hand to hand conflicts ever flung upon the screen. If we we're to make a choice between this fight scene and the fight scene in "Tol' able David," we would hesitate long before making our selections. Perso nally, we think that the fight in "My Dad" is more thrilling and that it- is done with a trifle more realism, thanks to the skillful acting of Johnnie Walker, who is at home in this type of role. Still another striking feature ,'of this production is the snow-capped grandeur of the mountains, amid which the action takes place. The vastness ot the snow lands, the utter desolation of winter, the loneliness of the trails, frozen tight from the numbing cold, all combine to make a picture of rare pictorial effective ness. It is a production well worth seeing. mount coming to the Eagle theatre Friday and Saturday and to the Central theatre next Sunday, were filmed in the monster stadium erect ed by the Hollywood Post of the American . Legion, where amateur bouts are staged every week before large audiences ot motion picture and boxing fans. About a thousand persons were employed as extras.
