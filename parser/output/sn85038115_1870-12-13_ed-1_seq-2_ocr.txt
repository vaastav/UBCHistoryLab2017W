TLhe re-estanlishment in trance or a system of government disconnected "with the ' dynastic traditions of Europe ap peared to be a proper subject for the felicitation of Americans.

We were asked by the new Government to nse onr good offices Jointly with those" of the Eoropean powers in tho interest of peace.

It Is not understood that the condi tion of the insurrection in Cuba has ma terially changed since the close of the last session of CoRgres. In an early stae of the contest the aathorities "of Spain inaugurated a system of arbitrary arrests, of close confinement . ot milita ry trial and . execution of persons . sus pected of complicity with the insurgents and of the summary 'embargo .of their property and requisitions of their rev enues by the executive . warrant , Such proceedings as far as they have affected the persons or property of citizens .ot, the United States were in violation of the provisions, of the treaty of 1795, be tweea the United States and Spain. Rep resentations of injuries resulting to sev eral persons claiming to be citizens of. the United States,: by .reason of such violations, were made to the Spanish government, from April, ,1863, to June last.. The Spanish Minister , at-Wash ington had been clothed with . a limited power to aid in Tedressing such wrongs That power was found to be withdrawn in view, as it was, which, however, did not lead, to a revolution .or the suspen sion of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised .by. the .executive power in Cuba,-and we were .obliged to make our complaint at Madrid.- In the negotiation thus opened and still , pend- .1 .1. .

On the other hand Spain would beat liberty to traverse! every ; material fact and thus complete equality would be done, a case which at one time threaten ed seriously to effect the notions. . Be tween the United States and Spain it has already been disposed of in this way. - - - arbitration of claims.; ' ,'s -V The claim of the "Colonel Lloyd As piriwall" for the illegal seiznre aud de tention of that . vessel, was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and 5 has resulted in an award to the United States for the owners.of the sum ot $19,702.50 in"" gold'.'.' Another and long pending claim of a like nature, that of the whale-' ship Canada,' has been disposed of by friendly arbitration. During the pres ent year it was referred by the joint con sent of Brazil and the United States to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton,' Her . Britannic Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the volum inous mass of correspondence and tes timony submitted by the two govern ments, and awarded to the United States the sum of $100,740 09 in gold which Jias since been paid by tire Imperial Gov ernment. These recent examples show that the mode which tbe United' States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just und feasible and that it jiay be agreed to by either nation without dishonor, ft . is to be . hoped that this moderate demand may be ac ceded to bvciipain without further delay, Should the nendins resrotiations unfor- lunately and unexpectedly be without result, it will then become my duty, to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject.

SOUTH AMERICAS PEACE CONFERENCE. ' The long deferred peace conference between Spain nrtd the allied : South American Republics has been inaugora ted in Washington under the auspices of the United States.' Pursuant tv the re commendations contained in the reso lution of the House of Represeatatives of. the seventeenth of December I860, the Executive Department of the Gov ernment offered its friendly offices for the promotion ' of peace, and barnio between Spani and the allied : replinirtjs Hesitations and obstacles occurred !fo the acceptance of the offer. 'Ultimately,- however, a conference was arranged and was opened in this city oh the 29th'of October, last, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to -preshro. ' It was attended by the Ministers of Spaih,.P7e -ru-. Chili and Ecuador.' . In eonsequepCe of the absence of a representative from Boli-ia, the conference was .adjourned until the attendance of a plenipotentia ry from that republic could bo secured, or other measures could be adopted to wards compassing its object --.Tho allies and the" republics of Spanish reign on this continent may see in this fact a new proof of but sincere interest in their welfare, our desire to- see them blest with good government capable of main taining order and preserving their re spective territorial integrity, and of our sincere wish to" extend our own commer- cial and social relations with them.-The time is not probably far distant when in natural course of events the European political connection with this continent will cease.- -' Onr policy should be shaped in view of this probability so as to ally the'coramercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to; our own and thus give the United States all the pre eminence,: and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contemplated when: they proposed to join the Congress of Panama;.

The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than $100,000- 000 of our annual imports, ; besides in creasing our exports; - With snch a pic ture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us, in cluding interest of bonds held by for eigners'aud money shipments to our cit izena traveling in foreign lands, which are equal to the yield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easv to see bow this result is to be Otherwise ac complished. The acquisition f San Dominjro is an adhesion to the : Monroe doctrine. It is a measure of national protection. It is Asserting our just claims to a controlling influence over' the great commercial traffic soon to flow from Eat to West by way of the lath" inns of Darien : it Is to build our oier- ehant marine. It is to furnish new mar kcts for the products of our farms,shops anjd manufactures j it is to make slavery unsnpportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once, aud ultimately so in Brazil : it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cu ba, and end an exterminating conflict, it is to provide honest means of paying onr honest debts without overtaxing the people ; it is to furnish onr-citizens with the necessaries of every day Jife ' at cheaper rates than ever before, and it is a rapid stride towards tlnrt greatness which the intelligence, indnstry and en terprise of the citizens of Ihe United States 'entitle this country to assume among nations. . ) HOW TO DO IT, 7 In view ' of the ; importance Vof this question, I earnestly urge upon Con gress early action expressive of its views' as to the best means of acquiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that by a joiut resolution of the two Houses" of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a Commissioner to negotiate for a treaty with the .authorities of San Domingo for the, acquisition of that is land: that appropriation be made to de fray, the expenses of such commission! Tbe question may be then determined by the action of the two houses of Con gress .upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Tex as. . So convinced am I of all the ad vantages to flow from the acquisition of San Domingo and of the great disad vantages, I mteht almost say calamities to flow from non acquisition, that : I be JieVe the subject has only to be investi gated to be approved. . . . ''' . '' THE TUEXICAN QUESTION. . ' It is to be regretted that our represen tatjons in regard to the injuries effected especially upon the revenues of tee uni ted States, by the policy of the Mexican government in exempting from import duties a large tract of its territory on our borders have not only been fruitless. but that it is even proposed in that coun try to extend the limits within which the privilege erlvertcd to has hitherto ' been enjoyed. The expediency of taking'in to your serious consideration proper means for countervailing the policy 're terred to -will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention.-:. It is the- obvi ous interest, especially of neighbecmc nations, to provide against injury to those' who may nave committed high crimes within their bowlers and who toay have sought refuse- abroad. '.

The Cab inet of London, so far as its views have been expressed, does not appear -to be willing to concede that Her Majesty's Government was guilty :of negligence, or did or permitted auy aet during the war by which the United States, has just cause "of complaint. My firm . and nn nlterablo r"nviction8; are directlv the l-evei as,- and I .therefore recommend, tos Congress to authorize the appointment of a comnHssioucr to take tho proof and the amounts, and the ownership of these claims, on notice to the represen- tative of Her Majesty at" Washington, and that authority be given for the settlement of hesoraimsrby the United States. I so' that the Government shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the responsible contro) of oil" tile demands against Great Britain. It can't be necessaryto jidd.that whenever Her luajesty s Government shall enter tain a desire for a full and friendly ad justment of. these claims, the United States will enter upon their considera tion with an earnest desire for a con clusion consistent with the -honor and dignity of both nations. t ;' i - THE FISHERIES. Tlie course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By. the first article of the covention of loio, oeiween ureal joruam aim me United States,, it, was. agreed. that the inhabitant of the United States should have forever, iueommon with, the Brit ish subjects the right , of, taking, fish in certain waters therein defined "in the wa ter not including'iu these limits named in the convention of -three "miles of the ports of the British coast.'; It has been the custom for mauy years to, give to the intruding -fishermen, of .the, United States treasonable warning of their vi olation of the technical rights Of Great Britain. ' The Imperial Government is Understood to have delegated the whole, or a share of its jurisdiction and control of the sea shore fishing grounds to the Colonial authority, known as the Do minion of Canada, and this: semi-indeT pendent but irresponsible agent has ex ercised its delegated power in an un friendly way. : Vessels have been seized without notice or warning,, in violation of the custom previously prevalent and have; been tabeu into the colonial : ports, their voyages broken up, and their ves sels condemned.' ; ' ' 1 - - ' , ' THE WAIL OF THE FISHERMEN. ,';', . Tliere is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatmeut was designed to bear harshly Upon f the haiv. dy fishermen of the United- Slates, with a view to political effect upon this r Gov ernment, -The statutes of. the Domin ion of Canada assume a. still broader and more, untenable jurisdiction oyer the vessels of the United States; Ihey authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering within three marine miles of any -of the coasts, bayscreeks or harbors of Canada into portto search the cargo and . examine the. master on oat Ii touching the cargo and voyage,and to inflict npon ; him a ; heavy pecuniary penalty if a true answer be not- given, and if such a Vessel is found preparing' to fish within three marine miles of any j such coa8's,j-.bays, cieeks-of Jiarborsi without a license, or after the expiration of -the period named ih the last license granted to it, this provides that the ves sel, with her tackle," fcc;, ' 4c, slmli .be forfeited. ; It is not' known that any condemnations have been made under tons statute.. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it : will, be my duty to take such steps as may , be necessary to protect the rights of the citizens of the United . States.. It has been claimed by her. Majesty's : officers that the fishing.: vessels of the United States hove no right to eEterr the open porta of the British possessions in North America, except for the purpose of shel ter and repairing damages, of purcha sing wood and . obtaining' water ; that they nave no right to enter at the . Brit ish custom houses, or to trade, except for the ; purchase , of wood and water ; and that they must depart within twehty fonr hours after notice to leave." - It is not known that, any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag : of the United States has been made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on any alleged construction, of the Convention of 1818 it cannot be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped ''that it will not be insisted on by Her Majesty's government :; During .the ' conference which preceded , the negotiation -. .of the Convention proposed ; to expressly , ex clude the. fishermen of the United States from (lie privilege of carrying on trade with any of Her British Majesty's sub jects residing within the limits assigned for their use, and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishing to have on board any gOods, wares or merchan dize whatever except such - as may be necessary for ; the prosecution of their voyage to and from said fishing grounds, and any vessel which shall contravene this regulation, may be seized, condemn ed. and confiscated with : their cargoes. This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put npon the . Ian guage of the Conventiori,' was emphat ically regretted by; the Commissioners, and thereupon was abandoned by the British'plcnipotentiaries," and Article!, as it stands in the Convention, 'was' sub stituted. If, however, it is said that this claim is founded -on ' provincial or colonial statutes, Rnd not npon the Con- vention, this Government cannot but re gard them aS unfriendly and !. In contra vention of the faithful execution of which the Imperial Government is alone responsible. - ,11 'anticipate', that an j at tempt may ' possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coming sea son to repeat these ' onhelghborly ; acts towards Our fishermen; - 7 i .: J . ,., ..: u ... . vi.- ., ..-- V.--- - , 5 BUTLER'S N0 INTERCOURSE PLAN. ; 7 ' J I recommend yoa to confer the pow;er to suspend, by proclamation, the operar tion of the laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares", and ..merchandise m Jiond across the territory of the United States to Canada ;. .and further 6houl such an extreme measure become necesr saryi to suspend the operations of any of the,-laws, whereby the yessels of the Dominion of Canada, are' permitted to enter .the waters of the United States. A like" unfriendly disposition1 has been manifested on the part of Canada with the maintainance of a claim of the right to exclude'- the citizens" Jof the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. v':i"-!--5'V:- : - f ,-. . NAVIGATION OIP THE ST. LAWRENCE. The river constitutes" a natural outlet to the ocean, with ah aggregate popula- tion of 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with anl aggregate, tonnage, of 661,867 Ions npon the waters which discharge into it ! The foreign commerce of onrporti ih ! these waters is open to British'competi-1 tion, and the major .'part of it is done In British bottoms'. If the American sea men be excluded .from this'natural ave nue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake ports of the Atlantic would be in foreign hands,. their vessels on trans-Atlantic voyages,havIng ah, access to our lake ports, wich would be denied to American vessels on a sim ilar voyage. v To state' "such a proposi tion is to refute its justice. During . the administration of John Qaincy Adams', Mr. Clay unquestionably demonstrated the national right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that tbe act Of the Con gross of Vienna -Inr-opening the Rhine and . Other rivers to all nations showed the judgment-' of European ; jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a coun. try through which a navigable river pasr sea have a national right to enjoy the navigation of that river to'and Into 'the sea even though passing through the ter- ritory ot another power. -This -right does not exclude the coequal right of the sovereigTJossessing the territory thrughjwhich pie river debonche3 into the sea, t make 'such regulations relative! toUie pofjcy of the navigation as may, be reasonably necessary but thdse eg-j iibtionshoulcl be framed in a liberal! spirifof comity and should notltfipose needless' burdens upon the "commerce which has the right of transit It has been found ih practice mote adf antaf goqus to, arrange these regulations by mutaal 'agreement The' Unite1 States are'l'eady to make any reasonable' ar rangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence . which may ; be si'iggeste by Great Britain. If the claim by Mr. Clay was just when the population of the States bordering on ' the shores of the lakes was only 3,400,X)00, it now derives greaterfor ce-and equityf rom.-tlie- in-. creased population, wealth,1 production and tonnage of the States on the Cana dian r frontier! tfn6i. Mr Clay advanced his 'arguments in behalf of our rights: v -.' ' ' . PRECEDENTS. : --.: ;. The principles for which he contended has been frequently and by various na tions recognized by law or bv treaty and has been extended t!o several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at May ence in 1821 the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable unto the sea. By the conventionetween Spain and Portugal it was concluded in 1835 that the navigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both the crowns. In 1853 the Arsentine Republic, by treaty, threw qjen the free navigation of the Parana and Uruguay to the merchant vessels.of all nations. v . : In 1856 the Crimean war was closed by a-treaty which provided for the free livia, by a treaty, declared that it regar ded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with the fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December, 186fi,tlie Emperor of Brazil, by Imperial decree declared the Amazon to be open to all the frontier of Brazil and to the merchant ships of all nations. .The great est livins British authority on the sub ject," While asserting the abstratft right ofj the British claims, says: It seems dull cult: to 'deny that- Great Britain, way ground her- refusal npoa strict law, but it is equally difficult, to deny",,, first,, that in sodoliiK she exercises harshly an ex treme and hard law. Secondly, that her ci niitfct wTtn. respect to the navigation of the St ' Lawrence is glaring and dwcredi taljy inconsistent wite her conduct with respectto tbft navigation bt the Missis sippi. On the ground, that she k)ssessed a small domain in which , the Mississippi took its rise.she insisted on this right to navisate tbe entire volume of its. waters On 'the ground that she possesses both banks of the St Lawrence where it dis- cbarffes into the sea. she denies to the United" States the -right of navigation, though about one-half of the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie,f Huron and -Superi or, " and. the whole of Lake Michigan,1 tl'rough . which, the river flows, are tli6 property .oT the United States. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultu ral Stares of the " West to the Atlantic seaboard ; to the citiaens of these States it secures a greater return for their la bor; to the inhabitants of the seaboard it offers cheaper food ; to the nation an increase in the annual surplus pf wealth. It is hoped that thegovernment of Great Britain, will see tne justice ot aoanaon ing the narrow and . inconsistent claims to which,, her Canadian province have urgeq Jtier adnerence. - i.- -v (DECLINE OP COMMERCE. .
