WAsnrsGTos. Dec a The second ses sion of the fifty -third congress began at noon today with the vice president in the chair ia the senate and Speaker Crisp wielding the gavel in the house. For some time before the wsslon was called to order the members of both houses were gather tug in the chambers, collecting in knots und discussing the rcccut political cy clone, as a trrncral thing, bat in some caws talking of coming legislation. Among the members of the dominant part- in the house, over half of whom were defeated for re-election, there is a great deal of feeling against the adminis tration for real or fancied grievances. It will be the purpose of the Democratic leaders to enrb as fur as possi ble the display of resenmiont. publicans will spare no puins to provoke nnd good their defeated adversaries into letting loose their vials of wrath. Finances Will Give the f'liance If the president outlines a financial scheme in his message, as anticipated, it will protiably furnish the opponents of his banking and finanri.il views their de sired opportunity. The sennte vr'.ll be lart;!y governed as well as the liouse, so far as liveliness is roneorne.l, by the finan cial recomnieirjiiiions, for there lire many senators who hnve no nt fur those views generally accoprcd as held by the admin istration. Without the finances, how ever, there is plenty of business to kep both houses employed forsome we-ks, and this question may not come up nntil after the holidays some timu. In fact it is al most certain not to come up until that timu, nnd it is doubtful if much business of any k'.ni will be done before Christ mas. Report of Comptroller Eckels. The iiuain-Lil question as presented by the supposed views "of the administration is lnrgely a question of banks and paper currency, and that being the case the re port of Comptroller Eckels is likely to present the ideas that prevail in adminis tration circles. The report is out and is largely devoted to the question. The comptroller snvs that the defects of tbe currency exist in the note-issuing powers of the national brinks and he holds that 'no section of the law should be disturbed which cannot lie materially improved upon and no amendment engrafted unless such amendment will work out better re suits than flow from the existing order of tUiusrs. As for the present law it must be conceded it has been successful in every material feature, excepting in the matter of bank note issues, and here the failure has been but a partlid on t. Th notes is sued by the banks under government su pervision huvc been uniform in appearance, nnd nnder any and nil circumstances of the full face value which they purport to carry. r.lnsticity the Ooe Thins; Wanting. ''They have possessed the first requisite of r. good bank note issue Immediate con vertibility intocoin upon presentation. It is probable that there could be no better plan for simply insuring the note holder against loss thnn tlie present requirement of a deposit of bonds to secure a bank's circulation; but it is equally certain that, a ni.'tluid could bo devised not less safe in this resect and in addition thereto pos sessing that which is essential and is now wholly wanting elasticity of issue. The complaint, therefore, made against the present system is that lacking in elasticity of isstie it fails to meet as fully ns it ought the varying wonts of the country's trade and commerce. Mrttrs the Cause of tlte Defect. "This defect must attach to everv scheme for n currency issued by the banks against a deposit of bonds the market value of which fluctuates, while the percentage of Issue, l-ss than the value of the bonds grouted the lmnks, remains nnchanged. It must also be wanting in such a meth od tieeuuse of the delay in the face of a piesning need, occasioned by a tight money market or other reasons, in secur ing and depositing the bonds required and taking out the circulation thereon." HOW TO 

SUPPLY THE NEEDFUL. Proposes to F.liminate the (Government ISond as the Security. After stating that any attempt to rem edy the defect noted must provide a cur rency as absolutely safe to the noteholder as the present the comptroller says: "It is rcsiicctfully suggested that not only as irood, but lietter results would be attained if the present bunk act were amended by repealing the provision thereof requiring each blink as a pre-requisite to entering the system nnd issuing bank note cur rency to deposit government bonds. In lieu of such provision should be substi tuted one permitting the banks to issue circulating notes against their assets to nil amount equnl to at least 50 per cent, of their unimpaired capital." The comptroller follows this suggestion with the further one for tho maintenance of a safety fund to be provided by gradu ated taxation upon the outstanding cir culation of the banks until the same shall be equal to not less than 6 per cent of the total of such outstanding circtibrrion, this fund to lie held by the govern u. ..t as an agent only and for the purpose of immedi ately redeeming the notes oi insolvent hanks. It is immediately to be replenished Dut of the assets of the banks on which it shall have a first and paramount lien and be exempt from assessment to the extent tf the double liability on the shareholders. Continuing tho comptroller says: "The profit upon the issue of circulation to the bunks by such change would be so aug mented that it is giving to them a fran chise for which it is suggested they should be culled upon to make proper return to the general government. The return should not, however, be of such a char acter as to defeat the ends sought in the privilege given. "The currency redemption of the legal tender issues and the treasury issues uu !er the act of 1890, and the reissuing ln .tead of cancellation of the same must al ways create distrust of the government's :redit abroad and at home so long; as the laws now upon the statute book remain unchanged. "The axtpcral sotfirxunent owtht to be wholly free from the direct Issuing ana redeeming of notes to pass aa money among tbe people. No government has rver yet successfully engaged in so doing, and the experience of the government of the United States has proven no exception to the rule. . Tbe general cost and loss en tailed upon the government and the periods. of uncertainty as to the govern ment's credit and the stability of our monetary system have been so great art to make the legal tender and treasury issues of 185 one of the extraordinary burdens placed upon the people. . 

6HOULO CANCEL THE GREENBACKS. Th Comptroller Wants Pnrle Sam to "Re tire from the Ranking ltasineaa. "These issues ought to be redeemed and sstncelled, and the government thus en- tbled to retire from the banking business. a business for which it is so poorly sqnlpped. The Intention of those who first authorized the legal tender issues was that it should so retire at the earliest prac ticable moment. The first congressional nactnient signed by President Grant after his inauguration as chief executive was ane reasserting the determination of tho government to preserve unquestioned the public faith, and the closing clause of it was: ''And the l"nited States also solemn ly pledges tta faith to make provision at '.he earliest practicable period for the re lemptlon of United States notes in coin.' "In the light of the present condition of the government's finances that which ought to have been done when there was a surplus in the treasury cannot now be undertaken, and the conditions must con tinue to weaken the country's credit and plague the lines of business nnlessa means is devised for removing these issues from the channel of current redemption until such time ns the govcrnaient finds itself in a position to do that which at first was the intent of all gradually redeem and cancel tltci.i. The ultimate redemption in coin of course must all lie upon the government, but the embarrassment does not arise from their ultimate, but from their current redemption. "It Is therefore suggested that if 

COTV press shall repeid the provisions of the present act requiring the national banks to make a deposit of government lKinds in order to secure circulating notes and sub' stitute therefor a provision giving them instead tho right to issue the same against their assets, it incorporate therein and as a part thereof that, as a prerequisite to so doing, the banks be compelled to deposit with tho treasurer of the I'nited States legal tender issues or issues nnder the act of lSisi equal in amount to the difference between the percentage of their capital stock of issues granted against their assets and the total of such capital stock. "The deposits thus made ought to re main with the treasurer until the bank ceased, either through voluntary or in voluntary liquidation, to do business; and in either case the government ought then to redeem and cancel such treasury issues deposited. Against this depirsit of legal tenners and treasury notes so made there should lie issued to the banks, dollar for dollar, national bank notes, either of the same or different design, as might lie deeuied best. The percentage of liank notes Issued against this deposit should be free from any taxation imposed upon circulation. "The government should not undertake or in any wise become responsible for tho current redemption of these- notes. Its responsibility should end with its re demption of the notes deposited to secure such circulation, when Jhe bank ceases to exist. At present a eurrent redemption fund of 5 per eent. of the outstanding cir culation is found sufficient, and it is prob able that in the future no greater amount would lie required." The comptroller makes several other suggestions in the line of chanires in the lnw necessary to carry out his ideas and then refers to the proposal to croute a commission to revise the system as fol lows: "A commission, non-partisan in its character, ronijHisrtl of men of eminent abilities, could unquestionably devise a currency system sound in every part and one which would commend itself to every interest of the country." But be advises its creation only in the event that con gress itself does nothing directly at this session on the subject. The "I'nspeakulile Turk. Xew Youk, Dec. 3. Tho Hendshack, an Armenian pcr publishd weekly in London as the ofliuiul organ of the Hend shack revolutionary tK-ioty, says that in Takat, a small village in Scvas, the public crier called upon all Mohammedans to do like their brethren at Sassotin.
