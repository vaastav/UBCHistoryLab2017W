THE PARISIAN, PARIS, TENN. EMPTY MARKETS Europe Will Need Our Help, Says President In Message to Con gressShips Our Greatest NeedNew Tasks and Du ties Imposed on United States by the War. Washington, Deo. I. The necessity for legislation to prodvide for trans portation of our commerce by sea was strongly urged by President Wilson In bis message to congress today. The president pointed out that the markets of the greater part of the world are empty and that ours is the duty to sup ply the needs not only of the coun tries of Europe, but also of the coun tries which hitherto have looked to Europe for their supplies. The mes sage in part follows: ' The session upon which you are now entering will be theje'osing session of the Sixty-third congress, a congress, 1 venture to say, which will long be re membered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal response to the thought and needs of the coun try. While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best that was in us, whether of char acter or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult undertaking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. We face new tasks, have been facing them these six months, must' face them In the months to come face them without partisan feeling,' like men who have forgotten everything but a common duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind In such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and anxious. . . Europe Will Need Our Help. . War has Interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of production. In Europe it is destroy ing men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and ap palling. There Is reason to fear that the time is near, if It be not already at hand, when several of the coun tries of Europe will find it difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto been always easily able to do, , many essential and fundamental things. At any rate they will need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them before; and we should be ready, more Ct and ready than we have ever been. If is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually sup plied with innumerable articles of manufacture and commerce can now u get only a small part of what they formerly Imported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. Here are markets which we must supply, and we must find the means of action. H ; We Need Ships. -7 It Is a very practical matter, a mat ter of ways and means. We have tbv resources, but are t Mly redy to use them? And if we can made ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not fully ready; neither have we the means of distribution. We are willing, but we are not fully able. We have the wish to Berve and to serve greatly, gener ously; but we are not prepared as we should be. We are cot ready to mo bilize our resources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their best, without delay and without waste. To speak plainly we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine. And now, when we need ships, we have not got them. i have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omis sions. The time and the circum stances are extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also. LX Use and Conservation. Fortunately, two great measures, I A finely conceived, the one to unlock, . with nrnrutr (tafeeuards the resources I' of the national domain, the other to epurage the use of the navigable liters outside that domain for the generation of power, have already passed the house of representatives and are ready for Immediate consider ation and action by the senate. With the deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. And theie la another great piece of legislation which awaits and should receive the sanction of the. senate: J mean the bill which gives a larger measure of self-government to the peo- i of the Philippines. I cannot believe bat the senate will let this great I measure of constructive Justice await the action of another congress. Its jpass age would nobly crown the record

But I think that you will agree with me that this does not complete the toll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of which I have spoken if we have not the certain and constant means of transportation upon which all profit able and useful commerce depends? And how are we to get the ships If we wait for the trade to develop with out them? The routes of trade must be actually opened by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges before streams of merchandise will flow free ly and profitably through them. ' Must Open Gates of Trade. Hence the pending shipping bill, discussed at the last session, but as yet passed by neither house. In my judgment such legislation is Impera tively needed and cannot wisely be postponed. The government must open these gates of trade. I very earn estly hope that the congress will adopt this exceedingly important bill. The great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it is a matter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have seemed to render it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session. But it cannot be perfected yet. Economy Is Urged. Before I close, may I say a . few words upon two topics, much dis cussed out of doors, upon which it is highly important that our Judgments should be clear, definite and steadfast. One of these is economy in govern ment expenditures. The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful study and assessment of the tasks to be per formed; and the money .spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns in efficiency and achievement And, like good stewards, we should so account for every dollar of our ap propriations as to make it perfectly evident what it was spent for and lb what way it was spent. It is not expenditure but extrava gance that we should fear being criti cized for; not paying for the legiti mate enterprises and undertakings of a great government whose people command what it should do, but add ing what will benefit only a few or pouring money out for what need not have been undertaken at all or might have been postponed or better and more economically conceived and car ried out The nation is not uiggardly; it Is very generous. It will chide us only if we forget for whom we pay money out and whose money It is we pay. These are large and general stand ards, but they are not very difficult of application to part'-ular cases. The National Defense. Th- 'iner topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the princi ples of our national life and policy. It Is the subject of national defense. It cannot be discussed without first answering some very searching ques tions. It is said in some quarters that we are not prepared for war. What Is meant by being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief no tice to put a nation in the field, a na tion of men trained to arms? Of course we are not ready to do that; and we shall never be In time of peace so long as we retain our pres ent political principles, and institu tions. And ..liat is it that it is sug gested we should be prepared to do? To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means' to do that, and shall find them whenever it Is necessary without calling our peo ple away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military service in times of peace. Fear No Nation. We are at peace with Jl the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a Just and candid interpretation of realities can say that there is reason for fear that from any quarter our indepen dence or the integrity of our territory is -threatened. Dread of the power of any other nation we are incapable of. We are not Jealous of rivalry In the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our lives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are, Indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we theraten none, covet the possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friend ship can be accepted and Is accepted without reservation, because It is of fered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect Therein lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and Raymond" L. Ditmars, curator of the Bronx zoo. The snakes were placed upon the dinner table in a glass recep tacle from which they could easily have escaped. When they appeared, several women at nearby tables, not knowing that they were tame, hastily departed. But the snakes were not alone! There was a large jar of frogs and toads of many strange varieties, that kept the cafe frequenters interested with an undertone of croaklngs. And the center of the table was occupied of concord. And we should be very Jealous of this distinction which we have sought to earn. Just now we should be particularly Jealous of It, because It is our dearest present hope that this character and reputation may presently, in God's providence, bring us an opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing settle ment of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship of nations. This is the time above all others that we should wish and re solve to keep our strength by self-possession, our Influence by preserving our ancient principles of action. Ready for Defense. From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked, are you ready to defend yourselves? We reply, most assured ly, to the utmost; and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We must depend in every time of national peril, In the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our ac customed principles and practices, to provide a system by which ' every citizen who will volunteer for the training may be made familial with the use of mrdern arms, the rudi ments of drill and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps, We should encourage such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value. The National Guard of the states should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not Inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the estab lished policy of our government And this, also, not because the time or oc casion specially calls for such mea ures, but because It should be our constant policy to make these provi sions for our national peace and safe ty. More than this earrles with it a re versal of the whole history and char acter of our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit me tc Bay, would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that we had been thrown off our balance by a wai with which we have nothing to do, whose causes cannot touch us, whos very existence affords us opportune itles of friendship and disinterested service which should make j ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble, This is assuredly the opportunity fol which r. people and a government lik ours were raised up, the opportunity not only to speak but' actually to em body and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting con cord which is ba.i',; ron justice and tab and generous dealing. Ships Our Natural Bulwarks. A powerful navy we have alwaya regarded as our proper and natural means of defense; and it has alwaya been of defense that we have thought never of aggression or of conquest But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build? We shall take leave to he strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will be no thought of offense or of provo cation In that Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the ex perts tell us just what kind we should construct and when" will they be right for ten years together, if the relative efficiency of craft of differ ent kinds and uses continues to change as we have seen it change under our very oyes in these last few months? But I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There is no new need to discuss it Let there be no miscon ception. The country has been misin formed. We have not been negligent of national defense. We are not un mindful of the great responsibility resting upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experi ence and every new circumstances; and what Is needed will be adequately done. Great Duties of Peace. I close, as I began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of peace which challenge our best powers and Invite us to build what will last, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times the free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we pos sess. To develop our life and our re sources; to supply our own people, and the people of the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade; to enrich the commerce of our own states and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms, and our fac tories, with the creations of our thought and the fruits of our charac terthis is what will hold our atten tion and our enthuslar-n steadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive to show In our life as a nation what liberty and the inspirations of an emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for Individuals, for states, and for mankind. by a fern filled with chirping Insects, known throughout Japan, whence they came, as "walking sticks."

A railroad from Nome to Cape Horn Is being considered, and sometime we may be able to take a through sleeper from one end of the American continent to the other. In that case we would sample all kinds of climates from arctic to tropical and we would encounter endless variety of surface and scenery. Popular Mechanics says that several routes for such a rail road are being considered, but which ever one may be chosen the lines al ready built and covering over half the distance would be utilized. The fact that these exist makes the project seem less like a dream, but if we smjie over it we might remember that men of affairs laughed at Cecil Rhodes when he suggested a railroad from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo the en tire length of Africa but that road Is now being built Is more than half done, indeed.
