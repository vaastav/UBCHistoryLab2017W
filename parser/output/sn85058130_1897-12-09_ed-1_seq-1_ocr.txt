SOUTHERN OPPOSITION Many of the southern serators it is said oppose annexation because they fear that the Republicans will ulti mately secure political advantage by the annexation of the islands Of the Republicans in the senate by far the greater proportion accept Hawaiian annexation as an established Repub lican doctrine There are however quite a number especially from New England who are opposed to annexa tion of any more territory by the United States SIXTY VOTES REQUIRED The full membership of the senate is 90 It therefore requires 60 votes to pass the treaty as a treaty and with out resorting to the subterfuge of a joint resolution Thirtyone senators can defeat the treaty entirely and a much smaller number if sufficiently belligerent can prevent action for a long enough time The opponents of annexation say that at the present time they can count on 25 Democratic senators seven Republicans and three independents making a total of 35 or more than enough to defeat the treaty There are many senators who believe that by withholding their votes on Ha waii they may be able to force the president and his advisors to do some thing for Cuba V u V > 

KANAKA WOMEN Representative Tawney of Minnesota who visited Hawaii in company with Uncle Joe Cannon says it is the women among the natives who are opposing annexation The reason is he says they have an eye to future social prestige The native women are now I I recognized as the equals of the white I women and are classed in the same so cial set There is a disposition on the part of the white women however to class the native females as negroes and the natives believe that annexa tion will increase the number of white women in the islands to such an extent that eventually they will le relegated to the negro class entirely The na tive women are doing everything in their power to arouse a sentiment against annexation I JOINT RESOLUTION Washington Dec 8It is stated by those in a position to know that the reason that the Hawaiian treaty is not pushed in the senate is because the friends of the measure have grave doubts as to their ability to secure the necessary twothirds vote to pass it The impression prevails that it may be necessary to pass a joint resolution and annex the islands by legislation It has been found that a number of I senators who were counted for the I treaty are against it while others have I expressed doubts about the hasty ac tion Views of Japanese Minister Omaha Neb Dec SToru Hoshi Japanese minister to the United States passed through Omaha this evening er route to Washington accompanied by his private secretary Concerning President McKinleyr message and particularly as referring to the relations of Japan and the Unite States in connection with the proposer annexation of Hawaii Mr Hoshi de clined to express any views beyond reiterating what he said at the outset that there would be no disposition on the part of Japan to resist the acqui sition of Hawaii by the United States but that he hoped to be able through diplomatic negotiations to bring abou a peaceable solution of the matters ir I controversy
