An increase of $3,000,000 in the pub lic debt in four weks is doing fairly well for an economical reform adinn-i-i ration. The republican majority In the sen ate have resolved that Mr. Cleveland cannot palm of! that political chest nut known ns the "offensive parti san" on them Del. News. The Cleveland leader, (detn.) says: "The most ludicrous failure In the president's message, is the revamping of an old republiean stump speech against Inflation and attempting to palm it off as democratic statesman thlp." According to Oov. Ireland, of Texas, the area of land under cultivation in the Unite V States has Increased in fif teen years 97 per cent., and yet our manufactures have increased so rapidly that only about 8 per cent, of our total agricultural products are obliged to heck a foreign market. Gen Sherman turned suddenly up on an interview In St. Louis the other day and exclaimed : "Now, look here ; there's been enough written and said about 1en. Grant to give him a prop er place in history. You might as well question the greatness of Wash ington. iou fellows have done harm enough with your gossip already." The Otsego Herald says: "Our long legged rival up the street is like the the proverbial boy who had nothing to My. We knocked him out in one round with our bilious attack." It must have been severe wh?n it effect ed a person away up the street. You must certaiuly feel better now. If you are subject to these attacks it is a won der you have not been abated by the Board of Health. The partisanship of the Ohio su preme court, awarding the certificates to the democratic senators from Ham ilton county, will give the democrats a majority in the upper branch. The republicans, however, still maintain a majority on joint ballot, which insures another lease to the official life of that iinselftVh patriot and typical Ohio man, Senator John Sherman. Det. News. In his message the president re marks: "The fathers ot our families are the best citizens of the republic; wife and children are the resources of patriotism, and conjugal and and pa rental affection beget devotion to our country." This is decidedly re'reth-t-ff . ..... io come from an old bachelor whose efforts in the direction of becoming one of "the best citizens" have been to some extent clouded with suspicion. Det. Journal. Ilolert Gibbons of the Michigan Farmer, who has been around the state for some time, reports times among farmers better than they were nt the same period of last year. "Many farmers are holding their wheat until next spring, at which time they expect better prices. The wheat this year is of excellent quality, and the farmers holding.it are in a financial condition to warrant their doing so. General Meade Post, G. A. II., of Philadelphia, has passed resolutions strangly condemning President Cleve land for the removal of Postmaster Huidekoper. 'The resolutions state that the president has broken hi promises made to the Grand Army of the Republic not to remove old sol diers from 'office. This Philadelphia Post is simply wasting time and words. Republican old soldiers are removed wherever and whenever a democrat wants the place. Republican old soldiers may now retire into obscurity, no matter what was their patriotism or service or suffering. Greenville In dependent. Gen. Rosecrans has an article in fhe December North American Review, en titled. "The Mistakes of Grant," in which he makes an attuck on the Old Commander for statements in th article by the latter on "The Battle of Chattanooga," in the November (Jen ttiry. But whatever Rosecrans may Fay, he cannot change the facts of history. Grant defeated Bragg, raised the confederate siege of Chattanooga, and lifted from the country an intoler able weight of anxiety, and all of this In what Rosecrans failed utterly to do. It Is strange to hear Roserrann' at tempting to iliow that Chicamaua avos not, in effect, au Union reverse. He admitted It to be such on the field, nt the close of the struggle, to more than one of hta offleers. The verdict of history cannot be reversed as to Chicamauga.nor us to Grant and Rose rmns. The latter was a conspicuous failure ai a general, and he writhes un der the knowledge that the ccuntry Knowa it. Blade. A lare poitiou of our paper U tak en up with the Pro&idei:t' Mesge. It U lung enough for every purpose, and treats of the different subjects from everything elae but a democratlo stand-point. If the government Is conducted in accordance with the same, we shall not complain, but as the President's actions heretofore have not been in accord with his message, and as his message is not in harmony with the principles of his party, we expect to see but little good accom plished during the present session of congress. - Reports concerning the winter wheat so fur received are as follows: Illinois has a lessened acreage, but the pros pects are regarded as the best for sever al years. Michigan has sown the usual breadth, and in the main has a thrifty crop. Indiana reports a large acreage and generally excellent condition, al though the fly has done some damage. Kansas has a great acreage in wheat. and pronounces the chance better than ot the sume time last year. In Nebras ka, with about the same acreage, the plant looks well, but does not gain in favor. From the limited area in Ohio the crop is reported in better condition than usual. Toledo Blade. The Otsego Independent says : 'While thirty ur forty-prliillti,niete were jm rading the streets of Detroit last week, people on the sidewalks threw stones and ancient eggs at them, and we'll bet a cent thofe persons who threw the stones and ancient eggs were all re publicans ' That's right, never over size your pile when betting. Republi cans are not in the habit. of engaging in this kind of work, and it smacks pretty strongly of a habit the democra cy had in days gone by when it requir ed considerable courage to differ with them, as rotten eggs and stones were their most convincing arguments. It might have been republicans as the assailants stood on the sidewalk. If it had been those of like proclivities as the editor of the Independent, they would have taken their favorite posi tion in the gutter. For nearly two months the Detroit Tribune has been under Its present management, we have merely noticed the change in our columns. Why? Because an acquaintance with the Messrs. Nimmocks from their boyhood led us to believe, what has proved to be a fact, that the Tribune in their hands would be its own best advertis er. As the Post under Mr. Stlckney was a wondrous improvement over its former management, so now the Tri bune has taken a monstrous stride to the front. Republican to the last line, fearless and jut throughout, fresh news in nvery paragraph, and typo graphlcally almost perfect. It is the de sideratum long wished for by the par ty whose principles it upholds, and we be like the present, unparalleled In the history of Michigan journalism. The Detroit Journal says: "The Lan sing Republican enjoys the proud dis tinction of being the only newrP" In MW(r inat referred to the lute Vice President Hendricks as a copper head." He was a copperhead and one of the worst type on account of the in fluence he exerted. If he had lived up to his principles and went into the con federate army, he would have been en titled to more credit, as it would have shown that he had courage to uphold his convictions. If It had not been foi such as him the war would have been over months sooner and many lives and much treasure would have been saved to the country, for it is well known thnt it required nearly as many men to protect our homes from "but ternuts" and "copperheads" as we had in the field fighting the enemy. The grave covers many faults in our esti mation, but treason and cowardice are excepted. The supreme court of Ohio has done jnst what it was expected to do. It has decided that the confessedly, forg ed returns made to the board of can vassers In Cincinnati must be corrected by that board, overruling the decision of the circuit, court, which held that returns carrying the evidence of forg ery on their face should be thrown out. The effect of this decision is to give certificates of the election to the democratic delegation from Cincinna ti In the legislature, and reduces the republican majority in that body In joint ballot to the narrowest margin. So gross an outrage upon en honest ballot has never before been sanction ed in this country by any court of last resort. And it wos only made possible by holding upon the bench; in defense of law, one judge, Atherton, who was defeated in t lie last election by a ma jority of i'3,000. Had the laws been obeyed, the returns In his case would have been canvassed, or could have been, days ago, and u certificate issued to his successor, he being appointed on ly to fill a vacancy, which vacancy will cense to exist as soon as it pleases the democratic manipulators who have the whole swindle in charge to canvass the returns and declare the result. It hn not pleased them to do so yet, for. manifest reasons, and Athet-tou 1 meantime making way for his party as rapidly as his declining sun will allow It te one of the most impudent and out rageous proceedings that haj ever dis graced Ohio jurisprudence, and that is saying a good deal. We withhold further comment until we can see the decision promulgated under such circumstances and with such disgraceful surroundings. Det. Tiibiim. From 11 dir ctlons toiuo Imlicutious of htalthy activity and a satisfactory improvement in all brunches of general tra-ie. The movement of merchandise U reported of fair volume and increased confidence among dealers. The sharp changH to winter will probably largely increase the volume of sales in season able goods. The aggregate salts of dry goods are reported to exceed in a slight degree those of 18SL The in creased thinness in the rates of interest show that the amount of idle capital Is considerably reduced, it having been drawn off into the channel of trade. The railroads show largely In creased earnings. Lumber interests keep well up with the general Improve ment, and the outlook is hopeful and promising. D. V. Tribune. Today the republican partv simply insists that every citizen of every state shall have the right to cast his ballot according to the dictates of his own judgment and his own Interests with out fear, compulsion, restraint or mo lestation, and shall have that ballot correctly counted. That is and always has been an article of republican faith, and today is one of the unfulfilled pledges of the partv-unfultillfd because of tho hostility of the bourbon J of the solid south toward it. Because the republican party thus insists, the old abominal lie of sectionalism is again raised and howled and reiterated through the land to the bewilderment and deception of many good citizens. Fliht Globe. This "is the most unkindest cut ot all." President Cleveland must have failed to consult the Evening News concerning his message, or worso than that, failed to embody therein the ideas of Scripts. The message does not suit the theory of the News and poor Cleveland is thoroughly pommel ed in every issue, and among other vile epithets applied, is even called a "re publican." Hear him ye bourbons, and weep with him as he says: "But how does Cleveland stand en this sub ject. (Free trade). We quoted all he had to say yesterday. There is no see sawing in his phrases from protection to free trade. He opens with protec tion, continues in it and closes with it. He expressly confines reduction of tax ation to revenue which the govern ment receives, but interposes his veto in advance against any reduction of revenue which the favored monopo lists receive. He says not a word about cheapening ruw material by putting on the free list those which produce no revenue. He is willing that the income of the government shall be cutoff, but he.lnsfsts that the protected manufacturer shall cut hi pound of llesh out of the popular body. Thus a careful examination of tlie message tal questions of the day, which excite popular attention and which formed the issues of the last campaign, has an tagonized his own party, and now stands shoulder to shoulder '! Lc republicans." Scripp's complaint Is almost equal to Nasby's In his tirade against education at the X road, when he said "they thought a little education would help them and one of their number was taught to read , but as soon as he learned that the d d fool went and voted the republican ticket." In the memoirs of Adm Black, just published by his sons in Edinbnrg, is Mated an Incident which occurred in Adam's youth, and illustrates the se vere sort of orthodoxy that then pre vailed among the Kvangelicals of Scot land: "On one sacrament Sabbath morning, the wife of the Rev. John Colquhoun, of Leith, being desirous to have him nicely rigged out for the occasion, had his coat well brushed, his shirt white as snow, hi bands ban? ing handsomely on hi? breast; when she surveyed her gudvman she was so delighted with hi comely appearance, that she suddenly took him round the neck and kissed him. The Rev. John, however, was so offended by this car nal proceeding that he debarred her from the sacrament that day." . JJucklon's Arnica Salve.
