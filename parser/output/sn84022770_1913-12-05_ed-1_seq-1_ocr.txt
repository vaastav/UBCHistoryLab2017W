Would Open Alaska—Says Social Justice Should Rule—Wants Trust Law. President Wilson laid before Con gress last Tuesday the legislative am bition of the Democratic administra tion. Applause punctuated important utterances, and when he had finished there was an enthusiastic demonstra-j tion, and among those congressmen who would discuss the message there was a general indorsement of the ad ministration's Mexican policy. Less than 3,000 words long, the mes sage was one of the briefest and most novel of American state papers—a marked contrast as presented by its author foday to the hitherto lengthy marked contrast as prescribed by its -documents. There was another contrast conspic uously apparent. President Wilson iiad read three messages before—on the tariff, on the currency and Mexi can affairs. The first time he person ally addressed a joint session there was an atmosphere of stiff formality, applause was liberal, but perfunctory, and there was an indefinable air of precedent being broken —or a century old custom being revived. Tuesday the president's reception was warm, almost uproarous as he concluded his reading. The message in full is; Gentlemen of the Congress—ln pur suance of my constitutional duty to "give to the congress information of the state of the Unlou" I take the lib erty of addressing you on several mat ters which ought, as It seems to me, particularly to engnge the uttentlon of your honorable I tody, ns of ull who study the welfare und progress of the nation. 1 shall ask your indulgence If 1 ven ture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting before you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called •for the nctlon of the several depart ments of the government or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list Is long, very long, and would suffer In the ab breviation to which I should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of several depart ments in which these subjects are set forth in careful detnlls and beg that they may receive the thoughtful atten tion of your committees and of all members of the congress who may bnve the leisure to study them. Their •obvious lmi>ortanoe, as constituting the Tery substnnce of the business of the government, makes comment and em phasis on my part unnecessary. 

WANTS TREATIES RATIFIED. Asserts That United States Leads In Peace Negotiations. The country, 1 am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us •of n growing cordiality and sense of •community of interest among the na tions, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More aud more readily each decade do the nations manifest their willingness to bind them selves by solemn treaty to the proc esses of peace, the processes of frank ness and fair concession. So far the United States has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will. I earnest ly hope and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of ar bitration uwaitlng renewal by the sen ate. In addition to these It has heen the privilege of the department of state to gain the assent. In principle, of no less than thirty-one nations, representing four-flfths of the population of the ■world, to the negotiation of treaties by ■which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of Interest or of policy arise which cannot be resolved by the ordi nary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed and re ported upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation deter mines Its course of action. There Is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies 'between the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements—our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the World.

Ferris, in his annual report just filed, suggests that during the fire season of 11)14 operators of logging roads remove the exhausts from their engines and lengthen their stacks to give better draughts. By this means, he believes, the fire hazard can be re duced materially. The Simpson Logging company, one of the largest operators in the state, tried this method, after experiment ing with all kinds of spark arresters and finding them all ineffective. Mark E. Reed, general manager of the com pany sets forth his experiences after removing the exhaust, and states this method was a complete success. If other operators, after adopting this method next season, find it to be successful. Forester Ferris suggests that the law relating to spark arrest ers be changed by the next legislature. OIL "SIBF AT TJip "FIAL" Investigator Reports No Sign of Oil and No More Gas Than at Mound Before. The reported oil "strike" at the Ta hola gas mound on the Quiniault In dian reservation a few miles above Mo cllps by the Indian Oil company is a "fake," according to information brought back by a special correspond ent sent to the field by a Tacoma news paper. He sums the situation up in these words: "Oil has not been struck. There Is no gusher. Gas in small quantities is seeping up the prospect while the drill is out of commission and 'makes' in larger quantities when the drill is shaking up the bore. But this gas is not under a pressure of 200 pounds. Gas has been seeping through the mud crater of the Garfield mound for cen turies. This gas has built up the mount to an elevation of at least 150 feet around the original hill. Gas is to be found on several mounds in the reservation, 10 to 15 miles apart. There is no question but gas in small quantities is seeping through the ground all along the coaßt, but the lo cation of the source of supply is prob lematical. "At Tahola there Is no visible sign that oil of any kind other than that used to lubricate the bearings of the drill is to be found. No oil has come through the casing. There is no oil in the waste in the tailings. A careful examination of the small stream which runs from the bore down the side of the hill fails to disclose even a slight streak of oil. The vegetation shows no sign of oil. "At the derrick the so-called oil sand, ground from a marie shale at a depth of 350 feet, lies out in the rain, but the water fails to disclose any signs of oil. The 'sand' has not the 'oil smell.' "A visit to the scene of operations fails to substantiate the report circu lated along the Harbor cities and through the Northwest that a gusher had been struck and that a new prec dent had been set in the oil world by the striking of a gusher of a parafflne base oil at a depth of 350 feet." The Grays Harbor cities have "put over" their usual misrepresentation, but here is the truth. No newspaper would print such a story unless it were. TO DISCUSS CREDITS.

The machine, for which the rig ging is already constructed, is a stand ard and rotary combination drill, de clared to be the most complete of any of the drills now working in Western Washington. From the "log" of the old Christo pher well, near which this well will be sunk, the Crescent people estimate that their machinery will drill from 50 to 60 feet a day, and if that estimate prroves true they will make consider able headway by the first of the year. It is the intention of the company, also, to erect and equip another "rig" on another portion of their leased property near Little Rock, and the ex act location will be determined at a meeting of the directors today.

This decision was made by the coun ty commissioners last Monday after only one protest was presented to the proposed sale, and an "upset price" of $35,000 for the county property was fixed, meaning that the property must be sold for at least that sum. Report has it that T. A. Davies and associates offered $40,000 for the property. C. B. Mann, the local seedman, was the only one to protest to the sale, giv ing it as his opinion tHat. the present building should be repaired. In case the court house is bought by T. A. Davies, who is said to be the only prospective purchaser at the present time, the deal will involve the ex change of property at Fifth and Franklin streets recently purchased by him as a site for the new county building. As an alternative site for the new court house B. M. Price this week made an offer to the county commis sioners to sell the Lobby property at Seventh and Adams streets to the coun ty for $7,000, in which price is includ ed the removal of the present wooden building.

OLYMPIANS REACH EAST Loral Traveller* on Three-Year Teat (or I'rlae of $20,000. C. C. Beck, J. B. Ransom, G. W. Beck and R. G. Rayne, who left Olym pla May 1, 1912, with Ave horses and a watch dog on a trip to every state cap ital, reached Middletown, N. Y., a week ago last Sunday according to an Associated Press dispatch. The object of the trip is to test the endurance of one of the horses named Pinto, a group of Western stockmen having guaranteed the men in the company $20,000 if they make a trip reaching the capital of every state in the Union and arrive at San Fran cisco by June 15, 1915, the day of the opening of the Panama-Pacific exposi tion.

In no preceding sale has enthusiasm reach ed its present height, nor has partici pation been so general. From railroad magnate to humble bread winner, from the largest city in Washington to the remote country home, requests for Red Cross seals have poured into the offices of the Washington Association for the Pre vention and Relief of Tuberculosis. This is the one time during the year when the usually despised pennies may do a noble work and have a part in financing the world's greatest fight —the fight against tuberculosis.
