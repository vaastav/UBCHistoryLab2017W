Tho president's message to the Flfty rfxth congress la as follows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives. At the threshold of your delibera tions iou ure called to mourn with your count! vmen the deaih of Vice President Hobart.who passed ftom this life on the morning of Nov. 21 last Ills great soul now rests In eternal peui e Ills private life was pure and elevated, while his public career wns ever dis tinguished by large capacity, 3t'ilnless Integilty, and exalted motives. He has been removed fiom the high office which he honored and dignified by his lofty charactei, his devotion to dutj, his honesty of purpose, and noble vlr tues remain w Ith us as a priceless leg acy and exumple The Fifty-sixth congress convenes In its ilrst regulai session with the coun try In a condition of unusual prospet lty, of univcisal good-will among the people ut hiine and In relations of peace and friendship with every gov ernment of the world Our foreign commerce has shown great Increase in volume and value. The combined lm poits and oxpoits for the yeai are tin' largest ever shown by a single year in nil our history. Our expoils for 1893 nlone exceeded by moie than a billion dollars our Imports and oxpoits com bli ed In 1870 The Impnrtf per capita are 20 per cent less than In 1870, while the exports per capita are 68 per cent more than In 1 i70, showing the en- larged capacity of the United States It satisfy the wants of Its own Increasing population, as ;c!l as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations Uxports of ngilcultuial productsworo $7M,T76,142 Of manufactured products we exported In value $339,592,140, being larger than any pievious jenr. It Is a noteworthy fact that the only jears In all our hlstoty when the pioducts of our manufactories sold abroad exceed ed those bought abroad were 1S9S and 1)9 Government receipts from all sourpes for the fiscal vear ended June 30, 1S99. Including $11,79S,314 14, part n lyment of the Central Pacific rallioa'l Indebted ntos, aggicgated $C10,9S2,0U 35. Cus toms redpts were J200.12S.4S1 73. and those from internal levenue $273,437, J61 51. For the fUcal jcar tho exnendltuies Were $700,593,504 02, leaving a deficit of $89,111,559 07. The secretary of the treasury esti mates that the lecelpts foi the current libcal ear will aggregate $G10,9;j,ll.', nnd upon the basis of present appro priations the expenditures will aggre gate $G00,95S,112, leaving a surplus of $40,000,000. For the fiscal jear ended June 30, 1899, the Internal tcvenue receipts were increased about $100,000,000. The present rratlfjlng strength of the treasury is shown by the fuct that on December 1, 1S99, the available cash balance was $278 001,837 72, of which $239,744,905 30 was In gold coin and bul lion. The conditions of confidence which pievail tluoughout the rountry have brought gold Into more general use and customs receipts are now al most entirely paid In that coin. -i Buying Bonds. Tho strong position of tho treasury with respect to cash on hand, and tho favorable chow Ins mado by the reve nues, have made It possible for tho sec t;etaiy of the treasury to take action under tho provisions of Section 1,091, 'revised statutes, t elating to ihe sink ing fund. Receipts exceeded expendlt- uies lor mo nrsi live months of the curient flbcal yeai by $13,413,399.91, and, conditions It was deemed advisable and proper to resume compliance with vfi i. wiiiKing iunu law, i which foi eight years has not been done, because of detlclencles In the revenues. The treasury department then ortared to nui chase during No vember $23,000,000 of the f per cent, loan of 1904 or the 4 per cent, funded loan of 1907, nt the curient market price The amount offered nnd pur chased during November was $1S.40S, C00. The premium paid by the govein ment on Mich purchases was $2,283,521, and the net saving in Interest at about $2,885,000 Tho success of this opera tlon was sufficient to Induce the gov ernment to contlnuo the oifer to pur chase bonds to and includim the 231 day of December, Instant, unless tho remainder of tho . k nno unn oniiQH ,-,.. no uiviHiuiim uuinc, me secreiarv ot i mprciai uiumpns. i am satisfied tho ' L iuhb-jjchuhiu uounuary dispute the treasury estimates that there will Judgment nf the mimtn fnm-o, n, ' between the Argentine lemiblic and be a surplus of annioximatplv Jjn nnn n n nolipv nf nhi in mm .n"i,. i .

This Is especial ly noticeable at- tho crop harvesting and ci op moving peilod The National Banks. In Its earlier history the National Banking Act seemed to prove a reason able avenue through which needful ad ditions to tho circulation could from time to tlihit bo made. Changing con ditions havo apparently rendered it now Inoperative to that end. Tho high margin In bond securities required, re sulting rrom large premiums which government bonds command In tho market or the tax on note Issues, or both operating tocethcr, appear to bo tho influences which Impair Its public utility, The attention of congress Is respectfully Invited to this mattei.wlth the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modifications can be mndo In the National Hanking act as will render Its service In tho par ticulars hero leferred to more lospon elve to the people's needs. I nguln urge that national banks be authorized to organize with a capital of $25,000. I urgently recommend that to sup port the existing gold standard, and to maintain the parity In value of tho coins of the two metals cold ami ll- ver and the equal power of every dol lar at nil times in the market a d In the payment of debts, the secretary of the treasury be given additional imnr and clnigcd with the duty to sell I dinted mutes Ponds and to employ such other effective means ns may be necessary to these ends. The uthor lty should Include the power to sell bonds on long and short time, as con ditions may require, and should pro vide for a rate of Interest lower than that lixed by the Act of January 14, 187C. 'While there Is now no commr r clal flight which withdraws gold from thi government, but on the contrary, such wldcspiead confidence that gold seeks tho tieasury demanding paper monev in excharge, yet the very situ ation points to the present as tho most rutins lime to make adequate provls lon to Insure the continuance of the gold sta-dard and of public confidence In the ability and purpose of tho gov ernment to meet all Its obligations In the money which the civilized world recognizes n3 the best.

The re-establishment of our mprchant marine Involves In a largo measure our continued Industrial progress and the extension of our co mark as an upbuilder our sea-carrying capacity for the products of agrleul- cure ami manurncture, which, with the Inci ease nf our navv. mean more work and wages to our counti j men as well as a hateguaid to Ameilcan interests in every pari or tne woilil. Tho Trusts. Combinations of capital organized into ti lists to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle com petition, limit pioductlon, and detei- mine the mices of products used and , consumed by the people, are Justly pio voklng public discussion, and should early claim the attention of the con gress The Industrial commission, created uy me vci oi congress or Juno IS. ISIS, has been engaged in extended hpnHnn-u u,m vuriviv, ur tivune ana extent, or the Injuiies to tho public which mnv icsult for the laige combinations con centrating more or less numerous en terprises and establishments, which pievlously to the fonnatlon of the com bination wero carried on separately. It Is universally conceded that com binations which engross or control the mnrket of any particular kind of mer chandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by suppressing natural and ordinal y competition, whereby prices nio unduly enhanced to the general consume), aro obnoxious not onl to the common law, but also i j the uubllc welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If the nresent law can bo extended more eeitnlnly to control or check these monopolies or trusts it should be dona without delay. What ever power th congress popsessps over this most Important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted. President Harrlsbn in his annual message of December 3, 1889, tavs: "Karnest attention should bo given uy corgress to a consideration of thu question how far the restraint of thoso Combinations Of CQDltal mmmnnlv called 'trusts' Is matter of federal I m Jurisdiction. When organized, ns they often arc, to crush out all healthy com petition nnd to monopolize the piodue tlon or sale of an article of commerce and Bonernl necessity, they nie danger ous conspiracies against tho public good nnd should bo made the subject of tho prohibitory and even penal legis lation." An uct to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraint and mon opolies was passed by congress on the second of July, H90. The provisions of this statute aro comprehensive nnd stringent. It declares eveiy contract or combination, In the form of a trust or otheiwlse, or conspiracy In the re straint of trade or commerce among the oevernl states or with forclcn na tions, to bo unlawful. It denominates as a criminal every person who makes any such contrnct or engages In nnv such combination or conspiracy, and provides a punishment by fine or Im prisonment It Invests the several cir cuit courts of the United Staies with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain vlolatlors of tho act and makes It the duty of the several United Stntos dis trict attorneys, under the direction of the attorney general, to Institute pio ceedlngs In equity to prevent and re strain such violations It furthet con feis upon nnv pel son who shall bo In jured In his business or piopptty by any other poison or coiporatlon by rea son of anything forbidden or declared to bo unlawful by tho net, the power to sue therefor In any circuit court In the United Statou, without respect to the amount In controversy, nnd to re cover threefold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, In cluding reasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the act Is nlmed at everv kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly In re straint of lnter-state or international commerce. The prosecution by the United States or orrensos under tho Act of 1S0O Ins been frequently resorted to In the fed- Nicaragua canal commission in their 'tics for, nnd obstacles to, the enlarge cinl courts, and notable efforts In the approaching Investigation of tho Pan- ' "K'nt of makets In China for the raw restraint of Interstate commetce such lama canal nnd othir projected routes i Pioducts und manufactures of tho as the trans-MlsourI fi eight n'socla- across the Isthmus of Darlen.

"Though congrcs has been compelled to deal with this matter by legislation, me laws passed for that purpose thus tar have pioved Ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty, If the Insufficiencies of existing laws can bo lemedled by further legislation, it auviuiu ue none.
