They even have taken the country and the world into their confidence resanlins what Great liritain will demand at tho peace conference. The prime minister, T.loyd George, has told the people that, if he is elected and has a parliamentary ma jority in the house of commons, he will demand the surrender of the kaiser for trial before an international court. Also ho has placed Critish financial loss because of Germany at forty billion dollars and will demand that Germany make that sum good to the extent of her ability, of course after paying Kelginm and France for the ruin wrought in those countries. Vinston Churchill has stated, as has tho Hritish premier, that Hrltain never will consent to give up her naval policy, and the minister of-foreign affaiis, A. .7. Ttalfour. has dis cussed wilh Hie utmost frankness his position on how a league of nations should be constituted. Policy of Tru IH-mocracy. Tho approach of (he elections mny have caused these Hritish leaders lo speak wilh .more than usual fulness regarding the purposes of tho govern ment, if returned to power. l.loyd George has also declared for a dis criminative tariff in favor of the colo nies ami for protection of Hritish agri culture and' Hritish tabor, which also means the protection of Hritish capi tal from foreign competition. This has long been tho way of I'.rit ish democracy: To conceal nothing from the people that could - possibly be revealed. All through the war the public was kept informed of the prog ress of 'affairs, Whether the news was good or had. And now the questions before -the pome conference are re ceiving candid consideration by the Hritish voters who will determine whether the policies of the l.loyd George government shall be sustained or not. This should be the policy in every democracy. Different in Amerleit. Hut in the United States wS had tho sajme sort of elections as are now be ing held in the Hritish Isles for congress, lluj tho president elected to keep his own counsel. He did not see fit to tell the American people, when he appealed to them for the return of a democratic party majority, vhat ho purposed to do with that majority if the voters heeded his plea. 1 When congress met, the president delivered a message, but in it he failed to discuss with the people what his plans are when he Sets to France. He has not let it be known what the j official attitude is regarding the ex-j tradition, trial and punishment of the cx-kaioer. As for Mr. Wilson' plans regarding the freedom of the seas, wq do not in the least know what, he means by tho phrase, nor "what proposal he Is to make to the other delegates re garding it. Also what he purposes regarding the details of a league of nations is closely locked in his own breast, and possibly in the breasts of his other solves, the delegates chosen by him to represent himself. - Momentous (Question. The Journal does not hesitate to say that probably the most moment ous question which will be solved at the peace conference, so far as this nation is concerned, is what shall be the luture relations between the fni ted States and (ireat liiitain. Are the two great Knglish-spoaking democracies to continue to he friends, or are they to 'become suspicious rivals.' Are thev tolshare the respon sibilities of safeguarding the world's peace on the basis of mutual trust and helpfulness? If so, why lias Sec retary Daniels come out in advocacy of the construction of a navy greater than that of (ireat Hritain. n nation that must absolutely depend upon its navy for its security? The president has declared for open diplomacy, for an end to secret cov enants, lie once talked of "pitiless publicity." He has before him the example of tho frankness with which Hritish statesmen speak to the Hritish people. Will he wait until the con ference lias completed Its work to tell his constituents what his policies are? It has been intimated that he plans to reveal his policies in a sneech to the American armies in Eur.e.' That was how tho kaiser was wont to re veal his policies of government to the armed power of the omnire. Wo do not believe the president will make such a mistake, as would be the case of refusing to speak frankly to tho American people when addressing llieir representatives in joint session of congress and then disclosing his purposes lo the American nrmy, Also the American people' would j hardly excuse him should he wail until speaking in London o- Paris to ma lie known tho purposes ho has in mind iu attending the peaeo confer ence. American correspondents in nor many express surprise at the arrogant manner in which Teuton officials to them just how matters should be set tled to insure a lasting peace and pro mote prosperity in the ruined dis I riots of lielgium and France. sr.i: (;i:i:.vkivs iif Ti inx The show at tho I.yric Gerard's: "My Four Years in Germany" is a liberal education in itself. The form er American ambassador to the court at Herlin tells of German official life. He not only tells, but with actors of ability he pictures (hat life before your eyes. Tho scenes preceding the war and loading up to it are given with an accuracy that is astounding. Then you have America's answer to the German challenge. You see the marching armies, you almost hear the rumble, of the artillery as it moves to attack. You see men fighting to the death. One of the finest pictures is that of the Hritish grand fleet at the Kiel maneuvers, just when Germany was preparing to launch her mighty at tack against civilization. Another picture of more than usual moment is that of the "Eaborn affair" which raised a storm of protest in Germany against militarism: Along with it is the picture of the debate iir thrt reich siag, witnessed by Ambassador Ge rard from the callery, when the so cialists challenged militarism and re--fused lo stand and cheer tho name of the kaiser when the session adjourned tho first time in history when such honor was not paid t.) the jni ;.croi-.

Of course you have learned that your furnace, whether hot air, hot water or steam, heals admirably in hot weather. Also you probably have learned that in cold weather some thing is the matter wilh it. that can not he remedied until the south wind blows. The government has taken a hand and has put out a bulletin on how you should treat your furnace, if you would keep it in a good humor during cold weather. Hut householders are slow to take advice regarding the fur nace, even from tho government. T'nclo Sam may he all right to con duct great wars, and the like, but he never had the running of a furnace. That is supervised by the janitor, who can hardly be classed as a government official. Hal her, he Is a functionary who, regardless of his duties, keeps Hncle Sam's officials too hot in warm weather and too cold in zero weather. Like the mule, the furnace Is the problem of the man who has to work at It. Whatever furnace he has he wishes be had some other sort.

LEAGUE WHAT IT REALLY MEANS H' JOSI II V. KEKD. (The Morning Journal Is opening a nv- department for the discussion of the League of Nations idea, under the direction of .losiah V. Heed. Under this beading articles will appear every day. Cut them out. . Study them. See how far you can agree wilh them. It is hoped that the public will make this column their own. All questions with regard to the League of Nations will be carefully and cheer fully answered.) In the last article it was stated that people do things as nations whicli they would scorn to do as private Individuals, Diplomatists, too, often represent only the immediate material and economic interests of their peo ple. And indeed people, .qs a rule, fail to notice any discrepancy between their morality as individuals and their morality us a nation. They are led astray by Jungrfist talk. They take more pride in their country's bigness than in her honor. Yet in the highest sense the people of a free nation are responsible for their country's policy. After all, there is nothing so very fine about the toast, "My country! May she always be right, but my country right or wrong." We must get away from that idea. There Is another toast, not so well known, but a great deal better, "My country!, May she always be right; Vint when she is wrong, my God before my country!" Surely in a man's private life there is no question as to whether he shoujd put his conscience before his material interests. Why should there he this doubt when it comes to the life of a nation? Why is it that the people of tho world have a dual standard of morality one code of morals for themselves, another code for their country? The answer is not so very interest ing, yet there is no fact more gen erally accepted among sociologists. Tho lan;r history of mankind makes the matter very clear. Over individ uals there has been the restraint of authority. Over nations there has heen no restraint. When Individuals banded themselves together in triheir, it was against the tribal law to steal, to cheat, lo murder. There gradually grew up a moral code appropriate to the civil code and actions which were originally forbidden because they stirred up trouble within t);e tribe which were fell to lie infringe ments of what was ri;;iit and decent also. Yet the tribal code made no such restrictions upon conduct to ward rival tribes. The same chief who forbilde stealing within the tribe encouraged it on tiie outside. Thus arose the dual standard of morality. At this time the tribe was the unit. Members of the tribe felt that com petition between tribes was the only possible arrangement. Yet a time came after trade relations had be come more important when the lead ers saw that war between the tribes did much harm to both and little good to cither. Their interests were seen to lie together. It was suggested ihat they bury Hie hatchet and unite for peaceful trade and common de fence. There were doubtless sincere men nt. that time who were suspicious of the suggestion. They knew about them, but what did, they know about the people twenty miles away? Could it be that they were much the same as themselves, with the same human nature, with similar purposes and capacities, with the same varying pro portions of good and evil in them all? It did not seem likely. There were dif ferent. They could not be trusted. How many times had they shown it? Over against these views were placed the progressive nations of the period. Wo know what happeneed. In the end, as was inevitable, the tribes came together to form a state. Certain rights which they had con sidered inherent In the tribe tlrey entrusted to ' the larger unit. The thing to make clear is that thev were abandoning no right. The tribe In the first place had had no rights ex cept what they gave it. Now the right to declare war they were vest ing in the state instead of the tribe. That was all. The advantages were obvious, once tho arrangement was working. Hitherto a wrong done by, one member of a tribe to a member of another tribe was .likely to embroil both tribe In war. Now gucli dls- t-r-i U 6 i-U, ' T' rl km, i V t. rz:ir-i-: v OF NATIONS putes could be settled by the common tribunal. Instead of mutual distrust und suspicion, there gradually grew up confidence and respect. We have hero gone into one epoch in the history of the world. And the history of the world has be'en made up of just such epochs. In the be ginning there was confidence only be tween a mother and her child and that only for the period until the child could shift for itself. The next step was confidence within the family and mmiuni in an outside. Then came peace within the tribe and war with other tribes. Now 4it last we have peace within the nation und war with oi nor nations. The inevitable goal is1 evidently world peace unless nor. I chance some gentleman on the planet Mars discovers a way to gas the earth; in which case all nations will cheerfully unite to sco what can be done about it. But must we wait for that to achieve world union? Let us get it firmly in mind that tnu League of Nations involves no radically new idoa. It merely pro- poses a larger unit than anv hitherto worked out. Hut since in tho past each acceptance of a larger unit, where such acceptance was both real and voluntary, has heen productive of good, surely in common purposes. There will he peace. There will be rivalry in good rather than in evil. And because in a properly constituted league, there, will be restraint upon the nations, an opportunity will be given for the growth of a national morality. Tho dual standard will be done away. Nations may continue to cheat sometimes, just as individuals do, but the face of the world will be set against it. There will be organized authority lo check it. And surely there will at last be an end to the reckless torturing of men and women and little children, an end to compet ing armaments and horrible instru ments of death. The Prince of Peace "camo that they niigh't have life and might have it more abundantly." To many persons this argument will bo inconclusive. Hut it should prove at least that ultimately the world will unite, if it disposes of the argu ment that there has always been war and always will be, this is enough. H shows that repeatedly men have united in larger units when thev be came wise enough to sen that it was in their best interests. Are we of to duy to be less broad-minded than the tribes which united into nations, than the districts which united into the Uepublic of Switzerland, than the territories that made Hrn7.il, or the states that made America? Certainly union will come event ually. Is now the time? Are we ready for it? Has .a suitable sclujnie heen yet devised? These questions will be discussed in future papers. MOIH-XTY TRULY HKCOMING.

"My country is too little to commit so great an infamy," is what Venozelos is reported to have told the German minister when the latter offered Monastic- to Greece and as much more of Serbia as she wanted if she would join in the murder and robbery of her ally. An analogous proposition was laid before the Hritish government at the beginning of ihe war, and It was re jected as promptly, if not in terms as grimly and humorously contemptuous. In Turkey and Bulgaria the Germans had U'tter luck, for In those "little countries" no need to. restrict propor tionately the size of infamies commit ted was felt. Their standards and tra ditions were different from those of Greece, and the barbarians of the nortli and tho south came easily to terms. K("rs TO TtKMKMIlRIt.

They have no place in my life! I have othur things to think about!" These were the exact words spoken to me a few years ago by Field Mar shal von Hindenburg. We were seated on the veranda of Hindenburg's favorite little cafe in Hanover. Along the street below had passed a shabbily dressed, careworn woman whom I recognized as the wife of Hindenburg. My observation that he never took her out gave rise to the cryptic utterance which appears above. . It typifies exactly the attitude of the idol of Germany towards women. Love has played no part in his chequered life. His career can be searched thoroughly, but no trace of those questionable scandals which seem to be part and parcel of the lives of great Huns will bo found. Hindenburg's wooing was prosaic. There wns no romance about it. Its counterpart can be found by the thou sand in industrial towns and villages all the world over. When ho was 21 yef.rs of age Hin denburg's mother died. She was the only woman for whom he ever show ed nny love. Out of his small pay as an army lieutenant he scraped a few marks weekly and denied himself so that she could have this small allow ance. Hi lorose, silent, self-reliant, intoler ant of the favors of other men, he yot felt the need of having somebody to look utter the little house his sainted mother had so long occupied. He looked about in Hanover 'where he then lived, and his choice fell upon Frauline Solf. She was a child of tho people, plain, unintelligent and unin teresting. Hut, as Hindenburg fou.id out, she was an excellent hD'isevifc. lie put his proposal before her in a businesslike manner. He so far un bent as to dilate upon his prospe?t!, and be offered her a hom and her. keep in return for marriage. She ac cepted the offer. For the daughter" of an agricultural laborer the was "doing very well for herself." Tho whole ceremony, apirt from he wed ding ring cost under 2 pounds 10s (512. no). There were no bridesmaids, no honeymoon, and no festivity. -I tin denburg's wedding gift to his wife, which I have seen many times, con sisted of an illustrated Uible with gilt edges, costing eight marks. The bulk of the impounds. 10s was spoilt ).i-. a wedding meal. The married life of this strangely assorted pair proceeded without a ! ripple. Hindenburg never consulted his wife about anything. She was his l.l'IV.t IlWlV'a fhutl hlti wl'a drift cn Innir si IK T as she prepared his meals and looked jt titter his jiome ho did not trouble. X Hut she nevertheless 'ived in secret terror of him; she was afra;d to have a thought of her own. From the moment the kaiser re called Hindenburg from Hanover his wifo has dropped entirely out of his life as though she never existed. Through his lawyers he now makes her a generous allowance, but he does not care a rap lur.v she spends it.

HAMPERS CIHXA. One of the greatest obstacles to : commerce in China is the "likln," the ' Internal tux on goods in transit, orlgi- nating as a war tax during the Taip- ing rebellion. The "likin" was origin- i ally a tax of l-10th of 1 per cent of the Value of the goods when it was first imposed, about 1853, but today its amount is apparently determined arbitrarily by the collector.

WAVAl escort OF PRESIDENT mm sight ft MONtNQ JOURNAL eeCCIAL lKD WIKC1 On Hoard the V. S. S. George Wash ington, Dec. 13 by the Associated Pres.-;.) The American battleship di vision joined President Wilson's ship at 5 o'clock this morning, providing cue of the few naval spectacles in many months of the vessels maneu vered with lights, and the sight was an inspiring one. Long before daylight the battleship Pennsylvania, leading the presidential convoy, picked up by wireless, ihe ves sels approaching from tho north. The night was partly cloudy with the moon visible now and then. Suddenly the Pennsylvania got a series of rapid sig nals from a destroyer, hovering off on the skyline and began signalling. The searchlights pointing a long illu minated figure into the sky, she wrote a message in flashes on the big black clouds. In a few seconds, tho answer, written on the sky by a battleship nwav over the horizon, began to come back. Then the top lights of the fleet came ever tho curve, one by one, and stood by the president's ship, w-hich pro ceeded on her way until daylight, when all the ships in the convoy spread out and fell into their appointed places on the right of the line of formation. The battleship Porisyivania was at the head of the center column, having on either side a line of destroyers, Ihen a line of four battleships, Ihen n line of destroyers on the fxtreme oul side. The battleship Wyoming, wll'n Vice Admiral Sims on board, headed the line on the left, followed by the Utah, the Oklahoma, the Nevada, and the Arizona in that order. The lino of the right was bonded by the New York, followed by the Texas, the Ar kansas and tho Florida. At 11 o'clock, a French fleet began to come, up from the soulh. There wore twelve cruisers steaming in one column. The French warships fired a salute slowly as Ihcy approached the George Washington lo the leeward and puffs of black smoke could lie seen all along the. line, but onlv a. few reports were heard. The American battleships moved ahead to make room for ihe French escort. A big hydro-airplane then appeared from the direction of Hrest. Jt circled and dipped over ,',he fleet as it ex changed signals wilh the flagship. Ijiler a big French dirigible floated by. flying the American colors. When the French warships had tak en their places, more than forty ves sels were steaming- in the line of col umns, the formation reaching both ways as far as the eye could see. President Wilson and the members of his party s-iood on the bridge of the George Washington to witness the na val spectacle. A mixture of two or more honeys always is darker than any of tho orig inal ones. (r - omg Out of B osssiess 'MY
