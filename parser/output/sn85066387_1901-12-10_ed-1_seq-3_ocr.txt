SINGLE CLUMP YIELDS FORTUNE Dredger Brings Up Gold in Folsom Mining District. SACRAMENTO. Dec. 9.— Donald Cam eron, manager of the Ashburton Mining Company, the stock of which is owned exclusively by Eastern capitalists, report ed this afternoon that yesterday's clean up of the dredger working near Folsom netted $6000 in gold dust. Cameron said this figure represented the average weekly earnings for some time past. He added that two more dredgers were being built by other companies near the one he is operating. Cameron said he visited the Blue Wing mine, near Folsom. recently, and while he was there a panful of earth was taken out which when washed yieldel $200 gold dust He is confident that the Folsom country is rich in gold. These for the most part are diggings abandoned by miners in the sixties as "worked out," but it appears modern methods bring forth the mineral which the early miners were unable to get through their primitive appliances.

BLAMES NO ONE FOR BAY WRECK Coroner's Jury Ends In quest Over Body of Crandall. Special Dispatch to The . Call. SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 9.— No censure 13 contained in the verdict of the Coroner's jury returned to-day at the close of the inquest over the body of William G. Crandall, the heroic passenger who, after aiding in the saving of many lives, went down with ,the ferry-boat San Rafael after her collision with the Sausallto. After "a short deliberation the jury re turned a verdict to the effect that 'Cran dall "came to his death by exposure or drowning in the waters of the bay of San Francisco as a result of the collision of the steamers San Rafael and Sausa llto." .. The jury was composed of L. A. Lancel, B. W. Studley, W. E. Robertson, E. S. Rake, Peter Brunn, C. P. Ware, P. Ross. Ben Merritt. M. Rovanagh and Owen Casey. During .to-day's proceedings the facts of the bay accident were retold by sev eral witnesses. The testimony was the same as that ■ given before the United States authorities at the- time of their investigation. Captain 'J. T. McKenzie of the San Ra fael described the events immediately preceding and following the accident. After every one was believed to have been taken from the San Rafael he made a complete tour of the sinking craft and saw no one remaining aboard. Captain W. T. Tribble of the Sausalito next told his story. Richard S. Wooser, engineer of the Sausalito, told of the speed of that vessel on the fateful night. Frank Dean, a waiter on the Sausalito, described the rescue of passengers. .John Petersen, second mate of the Sau sallto and lookout on the night of the collision, told of the collision. Charles Jensen, second mate and lookout of the San Rafael, said. the passengers and crew of that boat behaved, very well. The crew did. everything possible. Louis Werez and Clinton Mason, *pa.ssengers, testified that the crews, rendered all pos sible aid to the passengers. PHOENIX. A. T.. Dec. 9.— Constable Hop kins of Santa Barbara left here to-night -with George . Hayford, alias Rev.

' -, CARNEGIE'S GIFT TO GOVERNMENT Ten Millions to Establish University for Higher Education. Donor to Furnish All Money- Needed, Not One Cent Being Asked From Uncle Sam. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.— The Post to morrow will .eay: President Roosevelt has received a letter from Andrew Car negie, in which the latter offers to make a donation of $10,000,000 , to the j United States. The letter will be referred to Congress by the President in a special message. \ Carnegie's gift is for the purpose of es tablishing In Washington a university for higher education. "As far as his idea has been developed it proposes a gift after the manner of the bequest of James Smithson, the Englishman who gave $1,000,000 for the establishment and main tenance of what Is now known as the Smithsonian Institution. Smithson de sired the institution founded by him to be a factor in "the diffusion of scientillc knowledge.',' Carnegie 'proposes that the university which he is to endow shall be the great est institution in the world for the devel opment of higher education. He has consulted President Gilman of Johns Hop kins University, President Hadley of Yale, President Eliot of Harvard, ex- President White of Cornell and all the leading educators of the country. They heartily indorse his plan. The proposed university will not Inter fere in the least with the educational in stitutions already established, but will supplant them, for, according to the present plan, its doors will be open' only to those who desire to take up a post graduate course. Carnegie also wants the new university to take the lead in original research, so that the United States can eventually stand side by side with Germany, if not excel that nation in scientific develop ment. Carnegie's plan does not propose a na tional university In the sense that an ap propriation will be asked or needed. The Government is simply to be the trustee of the magnificent endowment, just as it administers the fund bequeathed by Smithson. It is probable that a board of regents will be appointed, as in the case of the Smithsonian Institution, or it may be that the Government will be represent ed on the board of directors, which, it Is contemplated, shall consist of men of national reputation. , : Carnegie has kept the proposed endow ment a secret until he could definitely ar range the plan and scope of the new uni versity. Even yet all these details have not been arranged, so that little more than the outline of his gift can be pub lished. It is known, however, that he does not pronose to ask from Congress a single foot of land upon which the university building will be constructed. The entire expense Is to be borne out of his en dowment. No site has yet been selected. It will, however, - necessarily be very large, as it is proposed to erect a series of magnificent structures. The amount of money to be given by Carnegie equals the sum of the present endowment fund of Harvard, and is con siderably more than the invested fund of Yale. 

OFFICIALS SEND AGENTS TO TREAT WITH BRIGANDS Reliable Information Beceived as to the Place of Concealment of • Hiss Stone. 'SOFIA. Bulgaria, Dec. 9.— According to Information received from Salonica, Miss Ellen M. Stone and Madame Tsilka, her companion, are concealed in the vicinity of Rilo (about live miles south of Dub nitza, in Bulgarian territory). »The news was brought by a Macedonian who left there December 1 and who furnished pre cise information regarding the hiding places and the names of the agents sup plying ftfbd for the brigands and their captives. It is understood that the . in formation is considered reliable enough to Justify the American officials in Turk ish territory to dispatch agents to treat with the bandits and that application has already been made to the Turkish Gov ernment for the free passage of the emis saries across the Turkish frontier, which is guarded by troops at every hundred yards. Claims the Will Is Forged. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.— Mrs. Caroline Blickle of Allegheny, Pa., has written to President Roosevelt asking his assist ance in securing what she alleges is due her from a fortune of $100,000 or more left by an uncle, Charles Brenlg, who went to Hawaii in 1860 under the name of Sim-. eon Weibert. She alleges that the will under which Samuel M. Damon, formerly a member of President Dole's Cabinet, is made chief beneficiary was forged. Crushed to Death by Falling Tree.

S /3o/*3/p ? I HIGHLY DRAMATIC SCENE IN THE SENATE CHAHBER Senator Tillman of South Carolina Challenges His Colleague, Senator McLaurin, to Resign With Him After a Brief but Bitter Controversy Concerning Their Respective Policies WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.— The Senate chamber was the scene of a highly dramatic episode to-day when Senator Tillman of South Carolina challenged his colleague, Senator Mc- Laurin, to resign with him on the spot. In order, to use his own language, that they might be able to "wash their dirty linen at home." McLaurin did not take up the gage. The Incident to-day was the -direct result of the very bitter con troversy which arose between the Senators in South Carolina last spring. McLaurin arose to a question of personal privilege to-day and proceeded to explain what he charged was a conspiracy to discredit him in his own State for facts and views which did not meet the approval of cer tain Democratic leaders. - A stir in the chamber followed when McLaurin of South Carolina arose to a question of personal privilege. He had before him a huge pile of manuscript. McLaurin Shows Much Emotion. "I arise to a question of personal priv ilege in connection with the publication of the statement that I have been ex cluded from participation in the Demo cratic party caucus," he announced. Witn evidence of considerable emotion he pro ceeded to explain that if such was the case and if he were to be without assign ment upon committees the rights of nis State, which he in part represented in the Senate, would suffer. The only notice he had ever had, he said, that he was to be excluded from the Democratic caucus came last spring before the adjournment of the Senate, when the chairman of the Democratic National Committee asked him why he no longer attended the Dem ocratic caucuses. He had replied that in view of his opinion of the questions grow ing out of tne Spanish war he thought his presence might.be embarrassing. Ihe Democratic chairman had replied: "Then perhaps it would be less embar rassing to you not to.be invited to the caucuses?" _ . . McLaurin said he had replied: "Certain ly " - This incident, McLaurin declared, was the culmination of a long series of events in a contest waged by an element pi the Democratic party against him. . Continuing, McLaurin said he could be silent did he not fear that the movement against him was one to keep alive section alism. For many years the people of the South had realized that they had not ob tained their fair share of the national benefits. McLaurin recalled the fact that although Samuel J. Randall had ad vocated a protective tariff he had been voted for in a Democratic national con vention for President. Hancock, although he declared the tariff was a local issue, had been nominated for President, and David B. Hill, although he opposed the in come tax. had not been read out of the Democratic party. :.\ , .. '.; .'. Explains Several of His Votes. The holding of such views by Northern men, no matter how diverse, did not en danger the position of certain political leaders, and consequently they were im mune from attack. But when a Southern man, said McLaurin, tried to get the ben efit of the tariff for his people, those whose political career might be ended by the success of his efforts were ready to crush and humiliate him. Now the principal charge against him was that during the McKinley adminis tration he had "been bought by patron age," and that he had renewed his for mer contract with President Roosevelt. Entertaining the high personal regard that he did for both the late President and his successor, McLaurin said it would be unnecessary for him to say that neith er would stoop ;to- so ignoble an act. He had voted for the war with Spain, and declared that in the same spirit in which ho had cast that vote he felt that he was compelled to support the administration that conducted it. He still thought that the conduct of the war should have been non-partisan, and during its progress he had never heard from President McKln- Iey's lips a word concerning party advan tage. While without official knowledge of the charges brought against him -by his Democratic colleagues, from the newspa pers he "understood that the principal charges were that he. had not opposed the ratification of the treaty of peace with Spain: that he had upheld the ad ministration in its efforts to restore or der in the Philippines, and to that end had voted for an increase in the stand ing army, and that he was in favor of the upbuilding of the American merchant marine. Excoriated New Democratic Leaders. "If these are the only charges," said he, dramatically, "they are true, and I glory in them. "But," he declared, "the dictates of rea son and conscience should not be stifled by the party lash." With bitter words, McLaurin then pro ceeded to excoriate the new leaders of the Democratic party, who had, he said, guided the party to its destruction during the last few years and were trying to crucify those who would seek to draw the Democratic party back to its old al legiance. "When McLaurin took his seat, Jones of Arkansas took the floor. Some of the statements made by McLaurin Jones con sidered a reflection upon himself, and said he desired to offer a statement concern ing the incident to which McLaurin had referred. At the extra session of the Senate last spring he had been asked by the caucus officer tor the list of Senators vho were to be summoned to a caucus, and McLaurin's name being mentioned, he (Jones) had said that he himself would see the Senator from South Carolina, "I met him In the cloakroom," said Jones, "and, recalling the fact that hs had not attended a Democratic caucus for more than two years, I asked him what his status was. He replied that his relations with the party were such that he thought it would be embarrassing for him to enter the Democratic caucus. I then said to him, 'You do not wish to be invited, then?' and he replied, 'Certainly.' As to the charge of ulterior motive on my part," continued Senator Jones, "I am content to treat it with the contempt it deserves." Tillman of South Carolina was on his feet when Jones concluded. In his char acteristic way he answered that while his name had not been mentioned, he wa3 the cause of it all. He would not at this time make an extended reply. Briefly he reviewed the controversy between himself and Senator McLaurin which led to the joint tender of their resignations to the Governor of South Carolina last spring, and told of the Governor's suggestion that the resignations be withdrawn. Tillman said he contended that the Gov ernor was simply "a box into which he had put letters for the Legislature." and that they could not undo the act, but Mc- Laurin had hastened f.o withdraw his let ter. Tillman said he had examined the record, and that of about 200 cases in the history of the Government where Sen ators had resigned McLaurin enjoyed the distinction of being the only one who had withdrawn his resignation after offering it. McLaurin made no reply to Tillman, but in replying to Senator Jones said that he did not desire that there should be any thing Dersonal in his charge that there had been an "ulterior purpose" in any thing he had done. Hoar of 'Massachusetts addressed him self to the legality of the resignations which the South Carolina ' Senators had sent to the Governor of their State. He declared that the resignation of a legis lative officer vacated the office at once, and that he doubted whether such resig nations could be withdrawn. In his opin ion neither of the South Carolina Sen ators had a right to address the Senate if the statements made by Tillman were correct. Tillman said he had been of the same opinion himself, and he suggested that the Judiciary Committee' look into the matter, as he should enjoy .nothing so much as washing the. "dirty linen" at home. Tillman Again Proposes to Resign. Jumping to his feet McLaurin declared In ringing tones that he was ready to meet his colleague at any place or at any time for the discussion of the Issues between them. Thereupon, in most dramatic fash ion, Tillman challenged his colleague to resign on the spot. "Let us draw up the papers now," said he, "and tender them to this man (pointing to the presiding of ficer), and that will settle it." All eyes were turned upon McLaurin, but the latter did not rise from his seat or make reply. Hoar • explained in detail the occasion upon which Speaker Blaine had held that a resignation immediately vacated a seat ih the House, and said a resolution for the expulsion of a member from South Caro lina was about to be voted upon, and the member, knowing that the resolution would be adopted, sent his resignation to the chair, with the intention of address ing the House and then offering it before the vote on the resolution was taken. As soon as Speaker Blaine saw the nature of the communication sent to him he .imme diately declared the seat vacant, thus put ting an end to all further proceedings. Hoar contended that if the facts bearing upon the case of the South Carolina Sen ators had been correctly stated it was doubtful whether they were entitled to seats- upon the floor of the Senate at this time. Tillman said if his colleague would pre pare any document that would vacate his seat as well as his (Tillman's) he would be glad to sign it. Lodge at this point announced smiling ly that while the resignations were pre paring he would move that the Senate go into executive session. After a half-hour behind closed doors the Senate at 2:53 p. m. adjourned. •
