Twenty-First Annual Meeting or the Beard of Managers Encour aclnx Reports Knlnrgtnc the ll.me-Worlt That Ilaa sseem Done Darlnsr the Past Year Election or Officers. The board of managers of the Home for the Friendless held their twenty-first annual meeting yesterday afternoon in the Center church chapel. There was a good attend ance. The report of the secretary, Mrs. Samnel Harris, was heard. She referred to the work done daring the past year at the Home and it was felt that it had been a year of prosperity. The matron has devoted herself in a most useful manner to her duties at the Home. Neatness and order prevail, making it a de sirable place for those who otherwise would roam about unprotected and nncared for. Mrs. Harris cited several instances of the past year where people had been taken in and of the good that had been done. The health of the children has been good. The assistant matron has done her part well in taking care of the small children in the nursery. She teaches them verses from the scriptures and hymns to sing. There is a Sunday school for the children, conducted by Mrs. Beebe, and a Bible class which is still in the hands of Mrs. S. D. Phelps, whose labors are highly appreciated. There is also a class for the adults, which is conducted by one of the members of the different church es each Sunday. Gratitude is extended to the press of the city for its kindness and courtesy. One of the principal things to be done now is the enlarging of the home. An other addition should be made, ft is now too small to accommodate the number of older women. This is one of the necessities of the coming year. The home should be enlarged as soon as possible. This can only be done by donations, and it is earnestly hoped that we will not be forgotten in this respect by our oitizens. It is to be hoped that they will continue to donate as they have in the past. The Home has already ac complished a great good, and it should be re membered in the wills of our wealthy citi zens. As we look forward to another year we are encouraged, tor the Jttoms is be tter prepared than ever for its much needed work. Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford, who had been the visitor to the home from the board of managers during November, being called upon for her report, stated that she had vis ited the home five times and was greatly pleased with the cleanliness, eoonomy and thrift evident. She referred to the little children who are tenderly cared for, and to the aged women who are spending peacefully their last days in this comfortable home, and appealed in behalf of the matron that one article for her comfort (viz: a wardrobe for her own room, in which there is no closet) should be donated by some benevolent per son. She also added an earnest "Amen" to the appeal of the secretary, Mrs. Dr. Harris, that the amount necessary for the erection of a home for the aged should be raised as soon as possible, and that the Home should be re membered in the wills of our wealthy resi dents, as it is an institution which has al ready accomplished great good. The report of Mrs. MoAlister. the visitor from the executive committee, was also read by Mrs. Hanaford and gave many intereetmg aetans concerning the Home, and the fore sight and thrift of the energetic matron, urs. wiieox. The report of Mrs. Timothy Cowles showed that the riome was in a most prosperous con dition. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year : President Miss E. W. Davenport.

C. Hendrick took the visitors in hand and showed them the many good qualities of tha truck. An exhibition of how it was worked was given on the Atwater bnilding on Grand avenne and on Broadway.

The semi-annual sessions of the Grand Temple and Grand council of this order were held yesterday at the hall of Anchor temple on Grand avenue. There was a large attend ance Cf representatives from all parts of the State. The sessions were presided over by T. H. L. Tallcott, Esq., of Glastonbury, grand worthy templar. The reports of the various officers showed the order to be in excellent condition, there being a healthy increase in membership. A new temple was organized last week at Cromwell with twenty one charter members. Means and measures were adopted for an aggressive propagation work and it is expected that several new temples will be organized during the winter. Judge Sylvanua Butter, Rev. J. W. Denton, C. D. Hall, Mr. G. P. Otis and C. M. Jacobs were in attendance from Safety Temple of this city. Veteran Firemen. The following veterans have been appointed a committee to make arrangements for the eighth annual ball and reception of the asso ciation, to come off soon: G. W. Stoddard, B. F. Brookett, Henry Howd, O., P. Levers and Henry Kumpf. The veterans propose to make their eighth annual surpass all previous efforts. The United States Programme com pany of 24 Broad street, New York, are en gaged on a very neat souvenir for the ball in the shape of a book giving brief histories of the veteran volunteer fire department and the Veteran association, for gratuitous circu lation. Wait for the Veteran Firemen's ball. Tho Homeliest man on Earth. The editor of a paper in Dubuque, Iowa, ones handsome, was a little over six months ago changed into probably the homeliest man on earth. This terrible change was due to a sudden attack of paralysis of the muscles of one aide of the face, following prolonged neuralgia. After electricity and the doctors had failed he tried Dr. Bnckland's Essence of Scotch Oats, and in thirty days was peiieotlv cared, and lost the unenviable notoriety of ibeing the homeliest man on earth. , : . .

Insurance Commissioner Fyler places the assets of the Continental Life 'of Hartford at $1,333,000 in round numbers, and the liabilities $3,070,000. The investigation has reduced the assets $1,077,000 as compared with the company's report January 1. The real estate is weighted with mortgages, and in many cases the equity in the property will not net a dollar. Tho shrinkage in the Sharp's works at Bridgeport a'one is $175,000. Policies which have been cancelled during the year, reducing liabilities $--!5,0C0, will have to be restored, the company hav ing no right to abrogate them.

The hearing is as signed for Saturday, before Judge Carpenter of the oupreme court, rresiaeni rarsons nas been ab sent Irom the city since his resignation last weetc. A criminal prosecution against him is not unlikely to result irom cue investigation.

Dimock that upsets the long accepted ruling that the evi dence taken bef ere a coroner is solely for the use of the State's attorney.

Dimock, the clerk of the Superior court, refused to produce the evi dence aud the matter was by mutual consent sub mitted to the Supreme court, which now decides in tavor oi iaiy.

Fair Haven's Second Industry Per sonal mention General Notes and Gossip. Fair Haven's other industry, the card printing uuBiuesn, ib uwiuiuk at present anu tne many a eat ers in this placa and vicinity will have all thuy can attend to in all probability until the frost gets out of the ground in the glad springtime. 1 he growth of thiB business is truly wonderful and it is a fact that a majority of-the printers began in an amateur way sbsut ten years ago with presses worth from $6 to $.'5. One printer who is worth quite a good deal of money now went into the business a few years ago without a cent. A great many have gone into this kind of business, but have met wi'h little success. It requires a good deal of business sagac ity and long-headedness to make much money on a pack of fifty printed visiting cards that retails for ten cents. The printers obtain their business pri marily through advertising, and when they obtain rcjjtira tu Mtvai umittouts nou ub largo circular? pamphlets, etc., and in this way suceeed in obtain ing agents all over the country, but principally ii tke West and South. Some of the printers speni replies to advertisements send nut large circulars. obtain- in printers snend large sums of money yearly in advertising and sev- eraplace contracts for a season aggregating janses BurKe or SDrtnetieid.

DOLLS TO BE SOLD, A Fine Display In Ex-Governor Elm Street A Ingersoll'e House On Unique Sale. There are lots of dolls in the front room of rx-Governor iDgersoll's house at No. 69 Elm street. These dolls have all been nice ly arranged for the sale which is to be held this afternoon. They have been prettily dressed, some of them, the more expensive ones, being magnificently attired. In fact, dolls of all kinds and descriptions, dressed in many different styles grace the room where the sale is to take place. The sale begins at three o'clock this after noon and lasts until seven. It is for the benefit of the Leila Day nursery. During the past two or three weeks the ladies who have the management of the iastitution have worked hard and faithfully to get everything in readiness for the sale. They have left nothing nndone to make the sale a success. Most of the dolls have been dressed by their hands. They have originated many new styles of dress for the little things. Minia ture bedsteads, chairs, hats, shoes and other like things grace the room. mere is one doll whiuh is sure to attract a great deal of attention. It is a fine one, and is as large as a three year old child. It is dressed in full English sailor costume, and the material cost nearly $50. The sale wnl, in all probability, be a splendid success. Campus Rote. The university catalogue Is now in press. The engagement is announced of Trnslow '86 and a Miss Baboock of Brooklyn. The barge was placed in position in the rowing tank in the gymnasinm yesterday. The president and Mrs. Dwight hare issued cards of invitation to the seniors to a recep tion at the president's residence next Monday evening. Professor Weir's lecture on "sculpture" was fairly attended yesterday. This highly interesting course should arouse greater in terest among the seniors. The noted botanist, Professor Gray of Har vard, is said to be in delicate health, The freshmen to-night debate the resolu tion that unions are injurious to laborers, The candidates for the crew took a ran in the direction of Weetville yesterday. Wooten '86 reads a paper before the Politi cal Science club to-morrow evening on "Trades anions and strikes in tha United States between 1834 40. A junior signs a communication in yester day's Yale News complaining of the ex amination schedule '91." Why lay this thunder to the poor freshmen's oharge? He should have signed it sophomore. Reply to aa Enquirer. To the Editor of the Journal and Courier: In your Monday morning issue is a com munication nnder the caption of "An En quiry," which would indicate that the writer was unaware that such a meeting as he con siders desirable has been held for almost a year, last season in Calvary Baptist church and this Tallin Center church chapel until the present week. A committee is now en deavoring to secure another and still more central place and the result will be an TUB 

COURT nounced in the Saturday papers. This meet ing is attended by two hundred teachers and others, as indicated by the general average. Blanks for taking notes of illustrations, ref erences, orientalisms, etc., are furnished at each meeting. Either your correspondent is unaware of the facts of the meeting at Tremont Temple or somewhat ambignous in expression. The great meeting for Bible study at Tremont Temple, formerly led by the Eev. Meredith, D. D., and now by the Christian novelist George W. Cable, is not held Sunday after noons, but Saturdays, and follows the inter national S. S. lessons, aa does the one held in New Haven, also another fact which does not appear upon the surface relating to the thousands who do not know how to spend the afternoon profitably, and that is the large number who attend the temple meet ings are recruited considerably from surrounding places. The idea advanced by your correspondent is a good one and hearti ly coincided with by a large number of the active Bible students of the city, as is shown by the fact that a committee of ladies and substantial business men of New Haven are already supporting such a meeting. Let all unite in pushing the work. DR. U'BIALLEY INNOCENT. RHse Annie Davis Swear That She Has Falsely Accused Him. A dispatch from Wilkesbarre yesterday morning fully confirms the dispatoh of a sim. liar nature published in our issue of Decem ber 5. Dr. James O'Malley is vindicated. He is not guilty of the operation he is reputed as having performed on Annie Davis. The girl herself has made an affidavit to this effect. According to Dr. E. S. Hayes, the physi cian who attended Miss Davis during her recent illness, it was while his patient was nnder the influence of morphine that she made the statement which temporarily proved so injurious to Dr. O'Malley's reputa tion. Dr. O'Malley aud his family claim that the entire scheme was concocted by parties who are lealous of the doctor s professional stand ing and influence. They emphatically declare that while the innocence of the accused can be established bevond the shadow of a doub: the damage already done can hardly ever be thoroughly repaired. Miss Davis' affidavit with great detcil sets forth that deponent is ol sound mind and memory, and that she has no recolleotion whatever of any sworn statements made by her last month before any justice of the peace. She declares the sworn statement purporting to be made by her about Dr, O'Malley of Pittston "utterly false and un true." midwinter Trlpa to California.
