LENGTH OF THE PAPER PATRIOTIC IN TONE AND CHAR ACTERISTIC IN PHRASE. Objection to the Zeal of the President for Centralization?Not a Cold Chronicle of Events. From the New York Tribune. The supreme emphasis of the President's message Is placed, as was expected, on the relations of the government to corporations. Various phases of this subject are dlscusssd at great length and with many character istic expressions of sociological and moral convictions. From the point of view of those- who seek In a message merely a chronicle of progress and an outline of specific measures this seems academic and superfluous. President Roosevelt, however, is not making merely conventional recom mendations. Sincere and Earnest. From the Philadelphia Ledger. The President had so many subjects on which he wished to express his views at length that he was not able?even by omit ting the usual detailed information?to bring his annual message within such compass that the busy man may easily read It. Like all that Mr. Roosevelt writes, the message bears the impress of his personal sincerity and earnestness, but it might have been made more effective by condensation. Centralization. From tlie New York World. "This government is not and never shall be government by plutocracy," says Pres ident Roosevelt In his message to Congress. "This government is not and never shall be government by a mob." Fine words, but they butter no parsnips. Mr. Roosevelt has submitted to Congress the most amazing program of centraliza tion that any President of the United States has ever recommended. Stands Pat on Rates. From the New York Sun. Mr. Roosevelt's first annual message as an elected President of the United States went to Congress yesterday. It Is a very protracted document. It might have been shorter, but it could not have been more painstaking in exposition, more character istic In phraseology or more patriotic both in intent and in tone. At the front is the question supposed to be foremost in the President's mind at the present time. Would Regulate Everything. From the New York Herald. The art committee of a nearby county fair offered not long ago a premium of $10 for "?the largest and heaviest oil painting owned in the county." Measur ing art by tilt foot rule or on the scales may not be aesthetic, but if the fair com mittee had made It presidential messages instead of canvases Mr. Roosevelt's 23,000 word document submitted yesterday to Con gress would have taken the prize without doubt. Compared in size with the massages of his predecessors it makes them look like the Declaration of Independence engraved on a 'three-cent piece. Centralization of power In Washington, federal control of pretty nearly everything and everybody is the dominant tone of the President's views, and which he urges Congress to back up and make possible by federal laws. Pieachment. From the New York Times. The Congress has never before been so preached to by any President as by Mr. Roosevelt in the message sent to the Capitol yesterday. It Is a sermon exposi tory of the rules of human conduct. It is unsha.ka.bly founded upon the changeless principle that right Is different from wrong It is solidly- built up with granite blocks of ethical precept. It bristles with moral maxims, which only men whose hearts have been steeped in turpitude would have the hardihood to dispute. The senators and members who listened to the reading of It must have risen from their task wearier but better men. Mr. Roosevelt's passion for utterance and his obedient and practiced pen spun the document out to the doubtless unprecedented length of 28,000 words. It Is a book in itself. The great length of the message is due to Mr. Roosevelt's haoit of composition. The Navy. From the Philadelphia Inquirer. President Roosevelt, through his numer ous addresses, has kept the public so well Informed concerning his views upon na tional questions that It is probable that most intelligent citizens could have given in advance a fairly good synopsis of his message to Congress. In fact, it contains nothing that is particularly new unless hta attitude toward the navy can be so con strued. Informing. From the Baltimore Sun. The President's message deals -with a large variety of subjects, some of which are treated with apparently unnecessary elaboration. Nevertheless, it is an inform ing document. A Message to the People. From the New York Mail. The President's message is first and fore most an earnest brief for government rate making; secondly, a preachment. In the best sense of the word, of democratic equal ity and forbearance on the text "Taken as I a whole we must all go up or go down to gether;" thirdly, a veritable arsenal of spe cific suggestions as to those matters, In cluding the tariff, in which the executive interest Is real, but not quite as great as in the railroad question. Above all. the document may be regarded as a message to the people, in which Mr. Roosevelt fully recognizes the responsibility of his Influence as a leader of public opinion. Too Long. From the New Yolk Evening Post. The greatest possible defect of a book, declared the Port Royal logicians. Is not to be read. The same is true of presidential messages, and Mr. Roosevelt has made his of such inordinate length that it will be little read.
