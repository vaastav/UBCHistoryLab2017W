GILBKKT Staff Corrrspondfnt t the Ktenlnc Tubllc Led ter Washington. Bee. 3. The Presi dent's illness is again agituting Wash ington. The Senate, especially the Re publican side of it, is busy suggesting that the President is incapacitated at present, manv senators declaring yes terday that the President did not write his lust message to Congress. Several circumstances have con tributed to this new outbreak of rumors. For one thiug the President's: recoverj has been extremel.v slow. Then, too, there have been no official bulletins in nian.v weeks. Those bulletius were stopped becnuse there was virtually no change In the President's condition from day to dav, nnd so the daily announce ments were meaningless Then failure of Senntor Hitchcock to secure an appointment with the Presi dent on Saturday started the story that Mr WiIon was worse The attitude of those who surrounded the President adds to the rumois. Questions about the President's actual condition provoke resentnunt The im plication is that speculations us to the President's health are prompted by politics and not by a legitimate in terest of the public in the chief of the nation. The President's friends allow the rumors to grow and grow until a denial liwwr MtmmltttoM&atim'ixn. - Hr Z4 VV llPll '& ZQf- - C3" B

Some formal statement about the President's condi tion cannot be much longer delayed. As to the President's actual condition It Is difficult to obtain anything moro than Indications. The frtilnro to see Senator' Hltrhcock was without signifi cance. Hitchcock's relations with the President are complicated by the con test over the Senate leadership. Neither he nor Senator Underwood cau go to the While House without starting rumors thnt the White House Is favoring one or tho other In the Sen ate contest. Beneath the surface some obscure maneuvering is goiug on toget each on the front page of the newspapers or to keep one or the other off that page. This situation in some vvnjcoii tributcd either to the announcement that the President had summoned Mr. Hlchcock or else to his failure to ob tain an npjSolntment. The President did see Secretary Baker ou Sunday, just before the secretary's departure for Paunma. This was the day after the failure of Mr Hitchcock to sec him. It should set at rest the storj thnt the President had suffered a relapse and become once more unable lo rcccivo visitors. i There is another little fuirly well authenticated story which iudicntcs the President's activity und capacity. Mrs. Wilson showed a friend at the White House n mass of stenographic notes which she says the President had pre pared as memoranda ou some subject upon which he was working. These notes were described by the person who saw them as perfectly clear and well formed. "Impertinent" and Persistent If this story is true, and there is no reason to doubt it. it should dispose of the rumor that Mr Wilsou is par alyzed in his right baud Uveu accent ing the story that the President can I sign his name with his left hand, per haps invented by some one to account for his undisputed signatures to docu ments, it is not to be supposed that he can write stenographic characters with his left hand, nor for that matter with i(kvimnlQM , F' Imagine llie consternation of early Pluladclphians in the days when Captain Kidd and Biackbeard were familiar figures along the Delaware. Think of the excite ment and anxiety with which they hurried to bury the family valuables in some safe 1 place. The household chest never was and never will be a secure place in which lo store valuables They are not safe from loss, either by fire or theft. 1 Our vaults defy both flames and burglars. We invite your inspection of them and will gladly answer inquiries as to terms, etc., either in person or by mail. n right hand uhlch has been recently paralyzed. , .These two circumstances to show how film ia the evidence regarding the Pres ident s Actual coudltlon.. If jou nBk, you arc told stories like the foregoing, but anything more definite Is refused. It may be simply that those who sur round the President nrc unnble to un derstand the public point of view nnd regard his illness as a private matter regarding which everybody is some what inipertiueut. Or it mny be that they are so clear In their own mluds about his condition that they cannot understand the doubt and confusion existing thioughout the couutry. 'Bid Not Willo the Message This much inaj be confidently as serted, the braiu of the President is perfectly clear. vIIis mind functions as clearly as ever it did, but his nerv ous condition is such thnt not much mental work can be dono by him. The quality of his mental operations is as good as ever, tho quantit.v of them has to be restricted. And it is almost equally sure that the President has suf fered no such paralysis as would be ap parent In speaking, in his face, or iu the use of his right hand. It inny be uccepted as true beyond doubt thnt the President h mcntnllv capable of performing the duties of his ofhee, but that in the interests of Ills recover he is forbidden by his phj -slcinus from performing any of them that it is not absolutely necessary for him personally to do. , There is little doubt that he did not write the message.

DISCOVERY THAT BENEFITS MANK8ND Two discoveries have added greatly1 to human welfare. I , In 18S5 Newton originated the vac-. uum process: for condensing milk with cane sugar to a scmi-tiquid form. In 1883'Horlick at Racine, Wis., dis covered how to reduce milk to a dry povder form with extract of malted grains, uithout cane sugar.- This product HORLICK named Malted Milk. (Name since copied by other..) Its nutritive value, digestibility and ease of preparation (by simply stirring in water) and the fact that it keep3 in any climate, i has proved of much value to mankind ' as an ideal lood-drink from infancy to old age.

X IhwII he did or did not, but tho evidence is sufficient that tho message was put to gether from the recommendations of various cabinet officers. It is not like ly that Urn President's physicians would permit him to write n long message such as that. It was not necessary for him to per form this labor. The usual Presi dent's message for many jenrs has been But together much as this one vvns. And doctor Orhjsou would naturally Insist thnt the President should avoid this labor. The failure to write the message is not significant. The Republican sen ators nre plajlng small persoual politics in Insisting upon It in public statemeuls as Important. Is SI 111 "a Verj- Slew Man" Doctor Grajson 'said to me, n few days ago that tho President was "still a very sick man and would be so for n long time." Physicians do not allow "very sick men" to indulge in pro tracted mental labor, when that labor can be uvolded. Even though he did not write It, the message Is the President's, icad, ap proved and signed by him. Cabinet Regains Powers In the same way the President is not lr!ne rnnsiilted unon the Mexican situ ation. The probability is that he is mmlznnt of the difficulty with Mexico nnd if Secretary Lansing's handling of Unturpatitd faeilitiet, a long tithed and well organized Company, dtitlngulth Packard Philadelphia Service. ejla6
