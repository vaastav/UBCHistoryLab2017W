( Appropriations Asked. Chicago, December :».— A special from Washington says : Senator Platt, Chair man of the Senate Pensions Committee, j lielieves that $150,000,000 will be required to pay the pensions for the fiscal year end- j ing June 30,1884. Congress will make the I appropriations for that year this winter. ! The amount appropriated for the current fis- j cal year was $100,000,000. The Commis sioner of Pensions has asked Congress to give him for the fiscal year ending June 30, j 1*84, $103,90*2,980. ! lt is understood that Secretary Lincoln will recommend a slight increase of the j army, but Congress is not likely to appre ciate his arguments. No more Indian wars are anticipated. The settlement of most of! the Western country by the whites has pro- ; gressed far enough to render an erneute ou j the part of the Indians powerless to do harm withont the resistance of a strong military force. The strength of the savages appears to be thoroughly oversloughed, aud with the ! exception of little marauding parties on the 1 Mexican border, no further trouble is ex- j pected. The reasons for the increase of the ; army are disciplinary entirely. The army is not large enough to give the officers the re -1 quisite practice in handling troops. The I Secretary is also likely to recommend that j the pay of soldiers lie raised from $13 to $16 \ per month—the old figure. The policy of 1 the Secretary will be to consolidate the dif lerent commands as far as possible and aban- ; don all the little posts in order to get sol- j diers enough together to make a respectable showing. It is said the Secretary will dwell at some length upon the subject of desertion List year 16 per cent, of the enlisted men ; deserted, and to fill their places it cost the j department $370,000. A large number of 1 men are constantly enlisting from the East who simply desire transportation to some far Western Territory with the intention of de serting as soon as they get there, which they proceed to do upon arrival at their destina tion. Comparatively few of them can be ar rested and brought back. This is one of the most troublesome questions to be met by the War Department, and the Secretary will, it is believed, as a remedy measure, reconi- j mend of Congress a slight increase of pay. ----— — - ------- j English Press Comments on the Presi- i dent's Message. London, December 4. —The daily Tek yraph says : President Arthur's message to Congress wilLiot rank with the great efforts made on similar occasions by many of his predecessors. If ever a State paper presaged the waning influence and coming downfall of a political party it is the message delivered yesterday by a man so blind to the true inter ests lying ahead of him and so infirm ot pur pose as President Arthur. Daily News: "It seems that President Arthur has taken to heart the lesson of the late elections. The passage in his message pronouncing in favor of civil service reform must be intended as an offer of reconciliation to disaffected Republicans." Referring to the financial part of the message the Ne tes says "If the reduction of the national debt pro ceeds at last year's rate protective tariff must fall to the ground, because there will be no means of expending the enormous surplus when the debt is effaced." The Times says: "No doubt President Arthur, after a series of cautious tactical movements, has placed himself at the head of the Stalwart party, and succeeded in de taching from Republican connection the re formers and independents, who, if few in numbers, are amoug the most eminent for capacity and character^ _ Dead. Washington, December 2.— Rear Admiral ltobert H. Wyman, who was stricken with paralysis yesterday, died to-day. Railway Exposition. Chicago, December 5. —The National Exposition of Railway Appliances will be held here from May 31st to July 7th. A distinguished list oif commissioners and rail way men back the scheme. Gold. New York, December brought $50,900 in gold. 5.—The Servia ! 

JOTTINGS OF A WANDERER. A Dark Adventure---Pioneer--Deer Lodgc--Thc Patron Saint of Mon tana Journalists. iFUOM OCR TRAVELING CORRESPONDENT. I Leaving Missoula one afternoon I again took the homeward course. The roads were in wretched condition which materially ad ded to the discomfit resulting from a heavy ^ gt(mn The ^ drew rapidly to its , ^ and soon its ^ber pall to the list of besetting difficulties, Slowly picking a way through the pine for ests we finally arrived at the foot of the highest grade upon the road. Its ascent and passage was not a particularly happy pros j ^ bat ^ nQ alternative appeared the sit uation was accepted wit h all the cheerful uess 1W3sible while ascen ding the darkness j , rapidly iacre ased till two spots, a trifle j blacker than the night, was all that could be j seen 0 f p0 nies. The summit was at-1 taineil and the animals, anxious to reach j shelter, started along the road at a rapid j . trot. Trusting entirely to their sagacity | ^ be y were allowed to arrange the matter of J speed, the correspondent reserving only the j a gtjfj* re j n jmd a fo^ on f} ie b ra k e , j w h en the P itcli of the buggy indicated that' , we were descending. Five hundred feet be- 1 j QW con ]d be plainly seen the dull glare ofj r j yer w jjich gathered from the heavy I g] 00ni a sufficiency of light to indicate its j eourse y heavy roar suggestive at times of i a moau or wa i] } surged up throught the pine j ^ rees c ij n g t 0 the mountain sides anil 1 1 seemed a warning of impending peril. At , intervals, and far away along the canon, the flames of hug h fires indicated the locality of i ( railroad camps and by their bright glare < served to aggravate the darkness about us. j down hill we go and rapidly with many ( a curve and turn, till a final pitch straight down into the inky pit, lands us safely in the bottom again. Soon after lighted tents ap pear and we are shortly at the graders camp j of Bass aud Fisk. Mr. Bass kindly greets us, supplies "a soldier's bed" and first-class j fare, all of which we were sorely in need, I Continuing the journey I arrived in good ! time at Pioneer, a placer camp that in years j past has yielded large quantities of gold dust. Here I found Mr. A. G. Wilhelm, who has been engaged in merchandizing since the j palmy days when "dust" was the principal ! circulating medium. He is located in a suh stantial stone building and carries a large j stock of general merchandise and miner's supplies. The United States mails are distributed , by Mrs. G. A. Clarke, Post Mistress, who has ; discharged the duties of the position very j satisfactorily for several years, Mr. Allan Johnson represents the black smithing business and has a large and well equiped shop. As a knight of the forge he ! is a success and the music of his anvil is 1 seldom silent. j A sixteen mile drive brings us next to j ; Deer Lodge, which shows little of change or , growth. The scream of the locomotive and -1 the clang of the bell which greeted my eais I on arriving seemed a singular and altogether j unnatural innovation and forcibly sug \ gested the truth of the saying, "the world 1 mo\ es on. The most extensive mercantile institution ; iu the city is that of E. L. Bonner & Co., j who occupy a handsome brick block with an immense line of dry goods, carpetings, ready made clothing, boots, shoes, rubber goods aud notions. The firm also has a grocery ; house in a separate building, which carries a j large line of staple and fancy goods. Mr. 1 Arthur J. Farnsworth, chief bookkeeper of the firm, is an old friend, who occupied a similar position in the office of the Bozeman Courier some years ago. His many friends will be glad to know that success has been his constant companion since leaving Boze man, and that his future is bright with promise. Mr. V. R. Goss some months since opened a large saddlery and harness shop and car j ries a heavy line of custom made single and double harness, saddlery, hardware, findings, j whips, blankets, and all the appurtenances i of a fi re t-cl*» establishment. A skilled workman himself, he has associated with him Mr. Thomas D. Rockwell, and the two gentlemen together make a strong team. Peter I-ansing still presides at his strong hold on Main street and will defend his colors, which represent a big boot and a little shoe, so long as boots and shoes are worn. His stock of everything in the line is large, and includes ladies' and misses' kid shoes of standard manufacture, gents' wear of every kind, rubber goods and find ings. No man, woman or child in Deer Lodge has any excuse for damp feet and bail; colds so long as the big boot and the little shoe and Peter Lansing survive. The banking facilities required by the town are supplied by the firm of Donnell, Clark and Larabie who have branch estab ishments in Butte and in New York City. The firm is one of the soundest in the West. Mr. Larabie has a weakness for blooded horses and has imported from the states several of the finest animals in the Terri tory. The business career of Mr. W. B. Miller illustrates how mach can be accomplished in a comparatively short time in Montana by skillful and industrious mechanics. Ten years ago he arrived in Deer Lodge with a ! j ar g P family and worldly assets that would no t aggregate one hundred dollars. A hamessmaker by trade, he at once opened a shop and began work. The small sums ac cumulated at first, were invested in stock and material and his business rapidly ex panded. He now owns a fine farm of 3*20 acres about a milejfrom town, which is con veniently divided into pasture and hay fields, and he has a band of eighty horses. For several years he has devoted much at tention to breeding hlooded stock and has a number of fine colts that in a year or two will command handsome prices. He still continues bis original calling apd the pros perity of the past year is evidenced by a j j j j j | J j , j 1 I j i j 1 i < , j , handsome frame dwelling house that is now being constructed on his farm. The Scott House maintains its prestage as a first-class establishment and the genial "Sam" seems to be growing younger as the years roll by. The hotel is well kept, neat and quiet. While in Deer Ivodge I was glad to meet Johnny Gerber, who is the same jolly, even tempered little gentleman that every one re members pleasantly, for several years past. Keeping only first-class goods, he has always had first-class customers, and as a necessary sequence has enjoyed as he de serves, a first-class success Dr. A. H. Mitchell, the veteran practi tioner, may justly be called the patron saint of Montana journalists. Toward this pro fession as in every other particular he is decidedly liberal and as he is a bright ex ample of what all men should be I here with give the list of Montana papers to which he is a subscriber : The Daily Helena Herald, Daily Helena Independent, Daily Butte Miner, Daily Butte Inter-Mountain, the Bozeman A cant Courier, the Madisonian, the Husbandman , the Mlssoulian, the Dillon Tribune and the Neto North- West. Is it sur prising that the doctor is successful iu the practice of his profession, in politics, and in every enterprise undertaken. If every pro fessional and business man in the Territory would only take as many Montana papers as does the Doctor, wealth and prosperity would roll in upon us as a flood, rich har vests would bless the soil, aud plethoric bank accounts would be the order of the day. ^ _ F. M. W. The Sioux Treaty. Chicago, December *2.—A special from Standing Rock says : The Sioux Commis sioners, after four meetings, Thursday after noon secured the signatures to the required agreement making the nothern boundary of the reservation the Cannon Ball river ; the eastern boundary the low* water line of the Missouri ; the southern boundary the Grand river, and the western the 10*2d meridian, making about sixty miles river front. Three hundred Indians are now here, and 1,500 more are expected from Sitting Bull's band and the Crow Creek agency. Each man, woman and child will be given a cow. They will be given aid in building houses and farming. Mechanics will lie furnished free for ten years, and the government maintains the schools for twenty years. Annuities will continue until they become self-support ing. A similar agreement was made with the Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Santee Agencies, and an immense acreage will be thus thrown open to white settlers. The Message. New York, December 5. —Among the Washington comments on the President's message is the following from Representative Page : "From what I have heard of it, it appears to be one that contains a great deal of valuable information, and also a review of the important mattere of the government. I think the message contains many valuable recommendations, and I agree with most of them. Upon the whole, I regard it as a strong State paper. Rumors Denied. Chicago, December 5. —President Porter denies that Vanderbilt has any interest in the Omaha road, and all other rumors about his resignation. 

FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS. a a a a SENATE. Washington, December 4.—The Senate met, and after prayer the President was noti fied that the Senate was ready for busi ness. Hale introduced a bill to increase the num ber of Judges in the Alabama Claims' Com mission to five. The Senate reconvened at 1:30, and soon after the President's message was read. Edmunds, in discussing an army measure, said that the country seemed dissatisfied with everything Congress did of late. After disposing of a few private bills vari ous reports and announcements were heard, and the Senate then adjourned. 

HOUSE. Washington, December 4—In conse quence of the unréscinded order of last ses sion fixing 11 a. m. as the hour for the daily assembling of the House of the second ses sion, that body was to-day opened by the Speaker at that hour. The gallery was com fortably filled. On the floor the bustling throng of members were engaged in friendly greetings and exchange of jocular remarks in reference to the recent election. The ap pearance of the chamber has not changed. The same dingy carpet covers the floor, though the revarnishing of thé desks tends to make the hall look brighter. The desk occupied during the last session by the late J. T. Updegraff, of Ohio, was taste frilly draped in black and ornamented with flowers. In the opening prayer the chaplain alluded to the death of Lowe and Updegraff, and gave thanks for the other members preserved during the recess in health and prosperity. The Speaker then declared the session open and the clerk proceeded to call the roll. Two hundred and two members were present and the new members were sworn in. Calkins presented a memorial against the swearing in of Shelly. Referred. Moulton presented the credential of Caine claiming to be a Delegate from Utah. The President informed the House that lie was ready for business. The Speaker presented the report of the tariff commission. Douglass, (Me,) embodying the points agreeded upon by the commission on ship ping and providing for the importation in bond free of duty of supplies for vessels en gaged in foreign trade. Ryan reported the Indian appropriation bill for the Committee of the Whole. Herbert, (Ala.,) introdneed a bill prohibit ing political assessments. By Rosecran8, to incorporate the Yellow stone Park Railway. By Ka&son, for the better regulation of the Civil Service. By Lefevre, a resolution asking the Sec retary of the Interior whether there had been any attempt to consolidate the Union Pacific with any other road. If so by what authority was it attempted. By Valentine, to compel the Union Paci fic to pay the cœt of surveying, selecting and conveying lands granted it. By Cox, asking the Secretary-of War what money appropriated by the River and Har bor bill had been withheld. Hasson'sresolution was adopted, allowing the Civil Service Commission to report at any 'time. This caused many jocular re marks. The President's message was then read. The deaths of Lowe and Updegraff was announced. Adjourned. !
