DESTITUTE ARTISTS MAKE APPEAL Sir Superannuated Painters and Sculptors Apply for Needed Help. Six destitute sculptors and painters, aped and in firm, well known In their profasatoes, it was learned yesterday, have this week applied for help to the Artists" Aid Society. One of these artists, who has a reputation both '" a «*ulptor and a painter, is more than seventy years of age and has recently become paralyzed. Another sculptor is seventy years old. and his aged wife Is heroically making a pathetic. and hope less attempt to earn enough to keep them both nlive. The other artists, through illness or similar misfortune, are unabl« to continue th« practice of their profession. These new and unex>»ci».l appeals for help, most reluctantly made by these victims of cir cumstances, may, it '■* hoped, excite sympathetic Interest in the movement started by the Artists' Aid Society and the Artists" Fund Society to raise J.V.000 to plae* superannuated artists and their wives in homes already established. As told in The Tribune, when it -a. is learned that more than a dozen w«-rj known artists In this cit7 we utterly destitute William Y. Havemeyer, chairman of the board of trustees appointed by the two artlsiB 1 benevolent societies, contributed »l.°oo and Samuel P. A very ?6'>> toward th« pro posed j-../.., fund. NOTES OF THE STAGE John Drew, who lias had the greatest dramatic success of his career In "His House in Order," at the Empire Theatre, enters on the last two weeks Of his present engagement there to-night. sir. Drew will be followed at the Empire by Miss Maude Adam*, whose engagement will be limited to five weeks, during which she will play "Peter Pan." Liebler & Co. yesterday completed arrangements with the New York Theatre management to bring back to this city for an extended run "The Van derbllt Cuj>." which was successful at the Broad way Theatre last season. Elsie Janls continues to be the chief excuse for the show. The opening date her? is »f>t for January 7. Grace George will give the 100 th, performance of "Clothes" at the Manhattan Theatre on next Mon day eveninc. Th»re will be souvenirs. On January 8, In London, Charles Dillingham will give a copyright performance of "The Red Mill." the new Blossom-Herbert musical comedy. After a ten days' absence from tho sice", Miss Marlon I,«a, who plays "Vida" in "The New York Idea" at the Lyric Theatre, resumed her parJ last night. THE 

PRESS AND MESSAGE. Spirit of the Comment of Support en and Opponents. TRUSTS. FTom The New York Times. Tli<» ■»M«»st «*oimsel the President Rive* to COS gress is contained in that passage of bis message wherein he recommends the amendment of the. Anti-Trust law of IWi to "obviate the evil' of pro hibiting all combinations of capital, whether good or harj. The President h»a b?<~ome convinced that "the effort to prohibit all combination, pood ov bad, is obnoxious where li Is not Ineffective." Combina tion of capital, like <-omh!rmtior. of labor, he r<» rrards as a necessary element of our Industrial sys tem; it cannot be prevented, and, If possible. Its prevention would do damage to the body pollti?. THE 

RIGHT OF APPEAL. From The New York ftur>. With the recommendation that the Government should b*» allowed a right of appeal on questions of law in criminal cases we heartily concur. Of roi'rpe. If the defendant in a criminal prosecution lihs been acquitted by a jury It is impossible to est.iW!«h any fivstem of reviewing the judgment which will en title the government to place the accused upon trial b eecond time. To do this would be to put him twice ln Jeopardy, In violation of Article V of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States. There is every reason, however, why the government should have the right of appeal in '■riminal cases in order to secure a review of the rulings of the court adverse to the prosecution upon pure questions of law wherever this can be done without Interfering with n verdict Of acquittal. • j PEOPLE WILL CONCUR. Frcm The Philadelphia Record. The mass of the people of the United States, how ever, will i^ad the long m^Fsntie with practical con currence in th» greater part of Its recommenda tions. md in the greater part of the pr Ing with which Mr. Roosevelt Interlards his stale papers. Becauai of the lack of bristling partisanship he lias not offended one-half the people while nursing Th» prejudices o* the other half. The tone is too Imperialistic; but that will he overlooked as the outflow of a self-confidence riot Inconsistent with ;ui undiminlshed popular faltli ln the Presidential F"od intent. » 4 "BULLY."

ACTING EMPRESS. Archduchess Appointed to That Dig nity in Austria. Archduke Francis Ferdinand's ever growing influ ence In aeain appar«nt In the appointment of his half sister. Archduchess Maria Annunctata, to the dignity of flrst lady of the land In Austria and Hungary, and as grand mistress of the various feminine orders or knighthood In the dual empire. It Is a dignity which may he described as that of acting Empress, and she receives as such all the presentations ..• women at court, natives as well as foreigners. Th» status was enjoyed by the wife of the Arch duke Otto until his death recently. Strictly speak ing, it should have, gone thereupon to Archduchess Alice, who Is also Qrand Doebwa of Tuscany and consort of the last sovereign of Tuscany, who lost his throne when his dominions v.ere absorbed by the Kingdom of Italy «n l^" Emperor Frauds Joseph, after consulting with the agnates, that la to mv, the adult mate members of the Hot ■-• of Hapsburg, and ■nlth his ministers, deckled thnt neither the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, who i» by b rth a Bourbon of Parm.i, nor yet the wife of h*r •eeond son. Archduke Joseph) who la a princess >»f the Neapolitan branch of i\v Bourbons, could possibly I* oalesated to take the part of acting Empress without causing all kin«ls of compllca tions and awkward rontretempa ("onflequenl on th? recommendation of thr- h^ir ni>r'arc::t. hii favor ite half-sister, to -v- did he la devoted, and who waa preset at his morganatic marriage, waa appointed to the dignity, which she will retain, not only until the death of her uncle, Francis Joseph, but nlso throughout the reign of her half-brother, Francis Ferdinand, ov.lnp; to the morganatic chnra< tei of his marriage. Of course, tha archduchess would have to sur render this honor in case of her marriage, a3 the etiquette and laws of the court of Vienna demand that the wife should always assume the rank and precedence of her husband when the marriage has been a right-handed instead of .i left-hand&a union. Thus, the Empeior's younger dauebter, Arch duchess Valeri* !<>st t!;<^ i>rei-edoni-« which had been hera i>y birth when she married Archduke Francis Balvator, of the Tuscany branch of tlie Hapsburgs, and now- shares I Is place low down In tho table «>f precedence, while Arcliduchesp Kllza betfa, the grandchild of the emperor, and the only offspring: <>* the late Crown Prince Rudolph, for felted her states and j>r«M-<?dpnce as an Imperial archduchess v.hen Khi> became the wife of Prince Otto Windlsi igraal • although the lattr-r. as a-Aon of a m°diatized anil formerly sovereicn l-.ouse. Is entitled to mate with princesses nf the rrljfning house» on a footing of equality. ONI.T WOMKN WITH EPIBCOPAL PRr2ROOA TIVES. Archduchess Maria Annunelata the new actlnj: ESmpreaa, although unmarried. Ins enjoyed the rank and status of a married woman ever since ■he bcame abbess of the so-called Convent of the Noblfi. T.adles of the Bradarhtn, at Pra'cue. The place of abbess of this order la Invariably held by one of the unmarried archduchesses, and was filled by Archduchess Christina until her marriage with the late King of Sr«ln. Although only bound to celibacy as long as she remains abbess, the arch duchess, b? such, possesses nlor.e .".rrtoiig ,'i!l wom?n in holy orders the right of exercising certain rji'scorinl prerogative?, among them that of crown liijt the Queen of Bohemia, when the r'rirr.ate of noherr.l.i crowns the Emperor as King of Bohemia, with the crown of St. Wenceslaa. On F*atc occa sions, and at church nnd court ceremonials, she appear?" with a species of mitre shaped Jewelled ho.-ddrcss. carries in her hand a jewelled crosier, similar to those borne by bishops and archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church, and wears with a peculiarly fashione.l black silk dress a lon* black mantl°. v.ith pweepln? train. The convent of which she is abbess was founded many centuries ag-o by the old Ings and queens of Bohemia^ but was reorganized and endowed anew by Empress Maria Theresa to s»rv« as a species of institute for Impoverished women of illustrious birth. All kinds of genealogical qualifications are required for admission. But once a woman belongs thereto she has no further care for anything, betng provided not only with a most comfortable resi dence in the royal palace of Hradachin and food from the royal kitchens, but also with servants, carriages and oven an allowance of money for minor expenses. The only thine :< c l:> of her in return Is that she should attend mass in the morn ing and vespers In the afternoon, offering up at these services certain prayers for the reisninp: fam ily. They are all either widow? or unmarried v •iii rn, and in case of their marriage ai compelled to resign their membership in the order. While they b^lonu to it they are entitled "<-aniir;e=s" or "cha nolnne«?e," ai d have tho stattis of married wom en, qualified, therefore, even if single, to act as chaperons. The Archduchess Maria Annum la 'a now thirty yearK .'!. Is a stately, handrome woman, who has Inherit* much of the comeliness and. many of th« talents of her mother, formerly tii<-> most beautiful anil still th*> mest gifted and brilliant princess of the reigning house- a sculptress, a painter, a poet and an equestrienne whose feats of horsemanship rivnll^d those of her Eister-in-law, th« late Empress, Totii' the TCnip^ror and his nephew. t!i» heir a;' rmrert, as well as some of the other aimatec, wished that the princess should ri'suin- the dignity of act ins empress, which she held after the assas sination of Empress Klizab«"t!i until the death of her own husband, Archduke Charle-s l^iuis, but ah wo'.iM r.ot liear of it, :ir..l it was in consequence thereof that :h° office was bestowed upon lit r daughter. HER JILTED FIANCE NOW INSANE Maria Annunclata Is extremely religious. In deed, after the somewhat s«n«atlrnal bre«kins: off of l.er engagement to D ike Siegfried of fjavarla oi\ the eve of ths dat<s appointed for th< marriage, she was bent for a time upon takhig llie vows of a full-fledged nun and withdrawing forever from the world. This desire was further strengthened wßen subsequently her former, fiance lost hia reason, which he has never recovered, for aha regarded herself ns in n. measure responsible for his Insanity, which she believes to have been caused by li«r pre clpltate actlc>a In jilting him when the profligacies and riN'-ir.ations r.f his previoua life were suddenly revealed to her by some officious relative or frienjl. She had been deeply In love with him, and under the circumstances it Is tiot astonishing tliat her demeanor ever since should liavo lieeu character ized J>y a certain melancholy, The Emperor would not permit her to take the vows of a uun, pointing «ii!t to her that It would he contrary to the inter ests of the dynasty, and that she could accomplish just as much good work, and even more, ;<s abbess of the Convent c-f the Noble lies of th« Ilrad schln. Recently she was able to convince herself of the truth of her uncle's worts, for had shA been a nun of the strict order which she had been anx ious to join s*ie would not have been able to nurse her unfortunate half-brother. Archduke otto, through his last dreadful Illness, or to have helped her mother to soothe both his sufferings and his dying moments •■ the absence of his wife, who had declined to remain at his bedside or to have anything more, to do with him. \je* me add that Archduchess Matin Annunclata is ntreroely fond of her half-brother'a morganatic wife, the Princess Hohenberg, is the prodmother of the latter*i chil dren, and in her new dignity of acting empress may be depended iip° r - *° do evrything in her power to Improve the position at court of the won derftilly al.le pr'.r.cess.

It was thought then by this reviewer that the you::g man had something to say to the world which would at least merit very serious attention, but | there have been disclosures since which diminish"-.! j his needling stature. PucdnJ'a name dawned on an lat»r. and h-an continued to emit considerable radiance ever since, ilk* that of I>»oncava!!o In his one irueccssfu] opera"; Spiaelli's came and went Six years ag in :i brief Irrupti.'ii of "A Basso Porto"; Mtignone has an yet rental Insloriously mute, for us. but we shall have to wait but a few days, If Mr. Conrie»l r.oeps his promUe. before Cilia's name will be made known *■> ua through an operatlfi version of •'Artrienne Lecouvreur." Tii^ juxtaposition of "Fednrn.'.' and •*Adrk.nne" Intli ctt»p a reversion to an^early manner of Verdi In th= choice of subjects, though there has been a worM of change since "[.a Dame dux <*a!n«>ii!as" became M lia Travlata*' and Schiller's "Ka'.>ala nnd IJebe" was transmogrified Into "Lulsa Miller." In one respect the ißtter day tend»nelt*s of the verltlsts Is commendable. It Is better that they should at tempt the Impossible with plays of Sardou and Scribe than to continue to wallow in the filth of the barnyard and shafnbles. Kven the most blood thirsty lover of the new Italian muse was bound to (;iow weary of the musk si style which only a decade ago was threatening to Infect Germany as well as France. It is hardly necessary to say that operatic mii?i- Is no longer what it was when Verdi redeemed his consumptive wanton with hi 3 melodies. Then It never attempted to meddle with the action, but confined Itself to characterizing the people of the play and celebrating the moods and passions con tured up at Intervals by it. Now. as wo wore com pelled to observe last night, the play no longer exists for the music, but th» music for the play. . Sensuous beauty is no longer sought: the tones have become only a condiment, a hot spice, which occasionally give raised expression to a shriek, but lor the rest retard the action and disturb attention which might more profitably be employed else v here. Puccini possesses the power of characteriza tion, ana can color with his melody as well as his harmony anil orchestral pigment. Nothing approach ing his skill could be found In Giordano's- "Fedora." A more sluggish and Intolerable flrst act than the legal leanest can scarcely be imagined. Frag ments of inconsequential tunes float along In a turgid stream, while above it the people of th* play chatter and scream, and become Intelligible and interesting only when they lapse Into ordinary speech. Ordinary speech Is the only speech that an expeditious drama can tolerate, and It is not raised to a higher power by the blowing of brass or the beat;::? of drums. The frankest confession of the futility of Giordano's effort to make a lyric drama- out of "Fedora" Is con tained 1 In the fact that only those moments In his score are musical in she accepted sense when the play stop", as ln the ease of the Intermezzo, which cuts the second act In two, or when the oM operatic principles waka again into life, as in Lorisfa confession «>f love. Here, in th* first Instance, a mood r^eehes musical delineation] and in the sec ond ■ jiaMsion which is naturally lyrical receives utterance. One device new to the op^nitic stage In its external^, at least. Is Ingeniously employed by the composer. The conversation In which Feiora extorts a confession from I^>ris i* carried on while a |>lanist entertains the princess's guosts wtth a sola upon liis instrument. But the fact that stnaj- Ing tones are useil and no! spoken ad'is nothing to the value of the scene. This opera, like Puccini's "To?ca," which Is In finitely Bner, would be Intolerable without (rood acting, and It has been the good fortune of both to ?::;.! operatic artists who are something mure than mere singers. Mm.- Cavalier! !h only a sin) ln the third instance, so to speak. In the first she is a marvellously beautiful woman, with a ."kill fn dress and v gracefulness atnl eloquence of carriage and pose which have an irresistible charm In them- selves; in the second, she is an actress of admirable parts. As a singer !i*r province can only ; be found in works like this of Giordano In which none of the elements of good Rinsing— not even the ! elementary one:; of correct intonation and agree- i able voice quality— ner>j ent«T. Her vocalization is not worth discussion: her voice is void of charm; j her (Terence to the text amazing. Yet she had ; her triumph, which was second only to that of i Caruso's, a. triumph won by Ida glorious voice, with j its sensuous beauty wedded to the accents of pas- j .slim. Other artists took part in the performance and acquitted themselves well, even these o; in- ; ferior lank. Th« ability t<> do that is one of the j advantages which this style of lyric drama offers i to tUose of little >r!fts. There n^ed re no particular- j ization. A record of the c;t.-i will sti3lcc at least j for to-day: I-v^ora limp. < ava:i-rt ; f I !*•»- tii-jt Hi'pearan-^. i • OlE* V.i*: \lt~n ! l>:n:ltrl Miss Mat!f«-!.J | In l*lccofc> Sav.iiirtio Mm*. .ia>.>*y .

Writer Secures Interlocutory Judg ment Against Publishers. George Bernard Shaw yesterday secured, through Sackett. Chapman A Stevens, Interlocutory judg ments in the Supreme Court against Herbert B. Stone & Co.. and Fox. DujSeld. & Co. These Judg ments were entered In an equity suit brought by Mr. Shaw to require th* reassignment to him ©f certain copyright*, an accounting for certain un paid royalties arj ths payment of damages for the alleged wrongful retention of the copyright!. Tha complaint sets forth Mr. Shaw's authorship of certain books: that his first license to publish his works was given to Grant Richards, In London, who subsequently, with Shaw's consent, transferred h!s rights to Herbert P. Stonw * Co.. of Chicago. The latter took out American copyrights as trustee for Shaw. It la further alleged that stone failed to account to the plaintiff tor royalties on large quantities of Ids works sold by them, and that many thousands o* dollars are due him from Stone arising out of f=uch publications. It was also claimed that aftr r a!' th- defendants had notice of, the claim« of tlie plaintiff. Stone transferred, to Fox. l).ittiftlci «t Co. their publishing business, in cluding the plates and unbound volumes of plain tiff's works Th.) dofendiints demurred to th* complaint, plead ing: that, admitting the truth of plaintiffs allesa tior.s. h* had not made out a cans* of action and that causes of action were Improperly united. Judge O'Gorntan's decision overruled the demurrers, hold ing that all the defendants were properly Joined and that "the facts alleged present a case for equitable relief." Th» judgments entered provide for final jiiiisrm»nt unless the defendants pay the coats and servo tbeir answers within twenty (Java.
