ssau The Emporia News. JACOB 8TUILEH, Kditor and Proprietor X&SIX'OllIA ica.ma, Friday, : t December 10, 18GO. , CHAXGE OP FIRM. It Is said that ' 'change' ' la written on all material things. Tire Emporia News Is no exception, and has had to succumb to this dec ire of fate. We hae sold one half of our printing es tablishment to V. W. Williams, late of Marshalltown, Iowa, but for some mouths a resident of Emporia. lie will, after the first of next month, be associated with u as an equal partner in conducting the paper and all brunches of the printing business. We have made this change principally be-c-AUKthe business has Increased to such an extent as to make it impossible for us to be editor, book keeper, manager, etc., and bestow upon each of these departments that care which they demand. We hope, by the change, and a division of labor, to make a better paper, as well as to devote more at tention to the mechanical Interests of the office. Mr. Williams Is a graduate of Hillsdale college, Michigan, and for two years before coming here had charge of a Seminary atMarshalltown, Iowa. lie brings to the discharge of his new duties a good education. sound Republican principles, industry, en ergy, and a determination not only to lm prove the paper, but to work with all bis might for the best Interests of the community and country In which be bas cast his lot. We can cordially recommend him to our pa trons as a gentleman In every way worthy or their confluence. We are especially thankful to the people or Emporia, Lyon county, and south wes tern Kansas generally, for the liberal support they nave extended to Thx News In the past. Our relations with this people for many years nave been, to us, of the most pleasant nature. We only hope we have deserved the sup port and confidence of the people, and we hope, also, that these pleasant relations may continue for long years to come. Be assured, dear readers, that we shall not abate any effort to make it so. We expect to make TnK News under the new arrangement, which takes effect January 1st, 1870, still more worthy of the patronage of the public. and desire that all should use their efforts to extend Its sphere of usefulness. And we would say, right here, that we desire to close up the old books before that time. All accounts for advertising and jeb work are to be paid to the present editor. The new firm will take the subscription book as It stands at that date, fill all contracts, and receive all dues. Completion of the U. P. South ern Branch Railroad to Emporia. We really have a Live Railroad. THE 

CARS HAVE COME ! A I.IXTI.U SCRAP OF HISTORY. THE IRON HORSE SSOKTETII THRO THE SE0SIIO VALLEY 1 ALL. THE PEOPLE PLEASED Tho latter part of last week it was announced that the track-layers on the Southern Branch Kail road would reach V A C?.l " r 1 n "i ucik uu ouuuuy ur .oxunuay. r ew cred ited this report. Others went out to where the force of hands were laying track and become convinced. Saturday night it was announced that the track was within half a mile of the Neosho bridge, and that tho hands were going to run in on us Sunday. Sunday hun dreds of people visited the workmen north of town. In the afternoon they ran out of tics and iron, and were com pelled to stop. The supply train came in Sunday night and the track was com pleted to the depot grounds Monday. Many people remained near the bridge Sunday night until tho supply train crossed, and greeted it with boisterous cheers, which were distinctly heard in town. The people were overflowing with joy. Every man we saw, includ ing the one reflected by tho mirror, felt just like a four year old boy with new boots. Here many had been watching for this event for twelve or thirteen years, subject to all the hopes and dis appointments of that long period and it had at last come ! It was difficult to realize 1 Our mind reverted to that day in June 1857, when the first railroad meeting was held in Emporia. John j. v attics maao a epeecn. we were then agitating the Arney road. He had mode a horseback survey of the route We remember of quarreling, that day, with a citizen because he would not ad mit that the Arney road would be built in less than five years from that time. The Neosho Valley, or Southern lirancn union Pacific, road was one provided with a grant of lands In the original system of roads in the bill passed by Congress in 1863. In that bill it was provided for as a branch road from where the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe road should cross the Neo sho to au intersection with tho Galves ton road where it should cross the Ne osho. The bill was afterwards amend ed and the road extended to an inter section with the Kansas Pacific. Other amendments were afterwards effected which made it an Independent road. In 1866 it received an additional grant of 125,000 acres of land from the State grant for internal improvements. Ac cording to the terms of the bill the franchises of this road were held by the A., T. & S. F. Co. The first attempt of the people of the Valley to avail themselves of the benefits of these rich franchises was made in a series of meetings held in the Valley in the spring and summer of 1861. I At tho instance of prominent men throughout the Valley, a conven tion was called at Ottumwa, Coffey county, on . the 9th of March, of that year. Two delegates were allowed to eajh representative district A. G x'roctor ana uie editor of this paper . were tho delegates from Emporia. G R. Harper, F. R. Page, J. H. Hunt, P. B. Maxson' and R. W. Randall repre sented the balance of this county. Col Goss was a' delegate, and at this meet , ing manifested that earnestness which - has characterized his efforts in Its be half ever since. In this convention Ly on, Coffey and "Woodson counties were T lolly represented, resolutions were adopted in favor of forming a separate company for the Valley road; asking the A. T. & S. F. road to relinquish to " the local company a fair proportion of the franchises ; asking an extension of the road to Fort Riley, etc N. S. 'Goss, P. B. Maxson and J. M. Rankin were appointed a committee to confer with the A. T. & S. F. Co., who made fair promises through S. C. Pomeroy. Subsequently the local company found out that Pomeroy was too sharp, for his own pocket's sake, to release those fran chises until they got more valuable. We understand when they were finally released Old Pom. made a good thing for himself out of them. This meeting adjourned to meet at Emporia on the 25th of April. At this meeting, in addition to the above coun ties, Riley was fully represented The committee reported that we had but lit tle to expect from the company holding the franchises. At this meeting steps were taken to have this road organized as a branch of the Pacific railroad, and to ask for it the additional franchises in bonds that had been granted to the Kan sas and Nebraska routes. Messrs. Ran kin, Eskridge and Goss were appointed a committee to prepare articles for the organization of a railroad company to connect Ft. Riley and Ft. Gibson. Af- ter attending to various other matters to further the object of the meeting, it adjourned to meet in Emporia on the 4tn day of June following. At the June meeting, Davis county was represented, in addition to those that had been represented in the for mer meetings. ' The committee appointed at the for mer meeting to prepare articles of asso elation, reported in favor of the imme diate organization of a company for the construction of a road from Ft, Riley via the Neosho Valley In the direction of Galveston Bay. After some other business, the following Board of Direc tors was elected : S. D. Houston, R. McBratney, R. M. Ruggles, J. H. Hunt, P. B. Maxson, J. M. Rankin, William Manson, N. S. Goss, and one to be af terwards selected for each of. the coun ties of Morris and Allen. This board organized by the election of the following officers : President, IC M. Ruggles ; Vice President, N. S Goss ; Treasurer, J. M. Rankin ; Corres ponding Secretary, R. McBratney ; Re cording Secretary, Jacob Stotler. Rug gles, Goss and McBratney were appoint ed to get up the necessary writings. Thus the movement for building this great line of road was put on foot. Of course it was ridiculed. But the men engaged in it believed in its final suc cess, paid their own board and livery bills, and went along. The matter rested here until the fol lowing spring, when a new company was organized under the State law which was passed at the session of 1865. It was organized quietly, and none of the old members were taken in except Messrs. Goss and Maxson. It was charged that the reason of this was, a part of the programme of a majority of the new board was to leave Emporia "out in the cold." Whether this was true or not we never heard. The new board of incorporators went actively to work. A thorough canvass of the matter was made from one end of the route to the other. The requisite stock was finally taken. Emporia did not readily take hold of the enterprise because of the threats to leave her out. But through the efforts of Col. Plumb this gentle man having been elected a director1 finally took hold of the matter. "We have not room to particularize now. Suffice it to say that in June, 1867, the counties along the line voted bonds to aid in its construction. The company finally got possession of the landed franchises. The same year a contract was let to an Eastern company headed by one Beach, to build the road. He and bis company proved a failure. But the local company, through skillful man agement, prevented their getting con trol of the franchises, and as soon as it was ascertained that Beach was a hum bug, let the contract to the present com pany, headed by Judge Parsons, of New York. They have built the road, and considering all things, built it quickly and well. Among the local company who de serve especial mention for their unself- sh and untiring efforts to secure the success of this great enterprise, we may mention Col. N. S. Goss, Col. P. B. Plumb, Hon. P. B. Maxson and S. S. Prouty. Never have the interests of a road, for a long time struggling between life and death, been more skilfully, eco nomically and ably managed. None of them, although they and their associ ates had tho management of the en tire franchises, ever made a cent. Col. N. S. Goss, we presume, is out hundreds of dollars, and the oth ers have also spent more monev and time than they have ever received pay for. Col Go6s was put at the head of the local company at an early day, and it seems he was the man especially pro vided for this occasion. He traveled from New Orleans to New York, spent his winters at "Washington, paying his own bills, and in fact, has thrown his whole soul and time into the enterprise for five years. He, together with Plumb, Prouty and Maxson, may well be proud of the grand triumph which they have achieved over difficulties that would often have discouraged and driv en from the enterprise men with less energy. They deserve and receive the thanks of the people of the Valley Of course there are scores of other men who deserve great credit, but we have not time nor room to further particular ize. We have the railroad. It is a errand monument to the enterprise and energy or a Deonie strn!r!riinsr with covert v. They had faith in the country, believing it would not only support railroads,' but would become a wealthy and prosper ous country. They will, we hope and believe, Boon begin to realize their fond' est expectations. 

SETT CONSTITUTION. Some of our State exchanges are discussing the question of having a constitutional con vention to form a new constitution for Kan sas. Some of the leading papers are favor ing the move with considerable earnestness That there are many provisions In our con stitution which need amending no one will deny. But the question occurs to us, would it De bettered by a new convention? The answer Is one full of doubt. While some glaring errors might be made better, oth ers unseen might be Incorporated in the amended constitution, and after a few years experience we might find ourselves just as badly oa In this respect as we are at present But the main Objection, In our present con dition of high taxation, would be the ex pense of a new constitution. Directly and indirectly it could not be furnished to us at less than $100,000. And we think the strong probability is the figures would reach $la0,000 before we got through. ' Ourjudg ment is against the matter. Let us get along until such a time as we can have anew con ven tion without its hurting-our pocket books so D&aiy. A. D. Richardson died on the 2d inst. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We hope no citizen to whom this document shall be accessible will fail to give it a careful perusal. There wa3 a time when General Grant, although unirersallv acknowledged to possess the highest capacity as a military lead er, was nevertheless deemed, by thous ands 'of good people, rather poorly qualified for the highest civil office in the gift of the people. But this can justly be said of him no longer. His whole administration thus far, proves that bis qualifications for this high of fice are of the highest order. Ilis message, free from the bombast, ego tism and dictatorial tone which inva riably 6tood forth as prominent fea tures in all State papera emanating from his predecessor, is a wise, able and statesmanlike document. Its lan guage is simple, its matter suggestive, and its views clear and comprehensive. With regard to Reconstruction he congratulates Congress , upon what it has thus far accomplished. Seven of the eleven seceding States have been restored to their proper places in the Union, while the eighth (Georgia) had once taken the proper preliminary steps for admission, having held an election ratifying her constitution, re publican in form, and electing a gov ernor, members of congress, a state legislature, etc. The governor was installed, tho legislature met, the re construction laws wero complied with, when, in defiance of the constitution she had just ratified, she ejected cer tain of her members because their color was darker than that of tho oth ers, and in their places admitted those who were disqualified by the third clause of the fourteenth amendment to tho constitution. As a remedy for this disordered state of affairs, he re commends to Congress the speedy en actment of a law authorizing the Gov ernor of Georgia to convene the mem bers of tho legislature as originally chosen, requiring each to take the oath prescribed by the reconstruction act, admitting none who are inelligiblo by reason of the third clause of the 14th amendment. Three states are yet to bo admitted. These are Virginia, Tex as and Mississippi. Virginia, however, has taken the proper steps for admis sion, and will probably be received without delay, and it will not be long until the other two shall be also restor ed. This will complete tho wofk of reconstruction. The matter of the finances deserv edly receives much attention at tho hands of tho President. Ilis views are important and well worthy of consider ration. He recommends an early but gradual return to specie payments. Immediate resumption he pronounces undesirable even if practicable. It would operate to the great detriment of debtors, and throw thousands upon tho verge of bankruptcy. Fluctua tions in tho value of paper currency ho deems very detrimental to tho in terests of trade, and as a remedy pro poses that Congress authorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation the currency thus redeemed until sold again for gold. The President recommends a roduc- tiou of taxation, especially that upon incomes. This counsel is wise and op portune. There is no longer a neces sity for such burdensome taxation. By reducing it at least ono-third, the na tional debt can still be canceled in fif teen years. Wo think that the income tax might well be abolished altogether. The object for which it was created no onger exists. It bas always been considered more annovinff than anv a w f other. It creates the necessity of pry ing into the private affairs of each in dividual onco every year. As the laws which brought it into being are soon to expire by virtue of their own limit ation, it seems to us that it would be unwise to renew it even under a modi fied and less objectionable form. As to foreign matters, the only ques tion of any considerable importance is that of the Alabama Claims. On .this subject tho President's language is far from being equivocal. He deeidedlv approves of the rejection by the United States Senate of the treaty in which Roverdy J ohnson so eminently distin guished himself and humiliated his country. lie deems it more desirable for the American people to allow this great wrong on the part of England to go wholly unsettled and unattoned, than to submit to a settlement which in nowise satisfies our ideas of justice, nor offers any adequate compensation for tho grievous wrong we have bus tained. He hopes that the time may soon come when the two governments may approach the solution of this great question in the right spirit and with a sense of what is due to tho dig nity, honor and right of each. There are other features of the message-, such as "China," "Indian Af fairs,". &c, which are equally interest ing, but we. have not tho time for a further review. Wo hope all of our readers will read the message in its en tirety. No previous administration has been a greater success than has been General Grant's thus far. We seem to be living again under the ad ministration of Abraham Lincoln. We have a safe leader. Our future looks bright. The breasts of the American people are warmed with hope and strengthened with confidence. May the signs of the times never bo less propitious.

In a recent editorial. The Commonwealth, betraying an ignorance unusual in that jour nal, confounds the distinct educational pro jects inaugurated in the north part of the State, and now under discussion in educa tional circles. 4 'Another Normal School' ' is one thing; the Public School University scheme is another, and entirely different thing. The two should be kept separate in the minds of the people. The Northern counties desire the establish ment of another Normal School, basing their desire upon the manifest need of a lar ger number of well educated teachers, and the efficiency of Normal instruction to ac complish the end sought. They propose to inaugurate this movement by asking the Legislature to appropriate, at the coming session, an amount sufficient to maintain a Normal Institute for a six weeks session next summer. The Public School University project is, as nearly as we cau make it out, a propo sition to create a Faculty of Professors inde pendent of all existing institutions whose duty it shall be to establish a set of degrees to be by them awarded to public school teach ers who, by passing a satisfactory examina tion Del'ore the Faculty, show themselves fit ted "to adorn the higher walks of the teach ers profession .'
