H i s c e II a !i v MY l'JSXXV IMP From Blackwood's Magazine. What was it ? A tallow candle, to bo Mire. Toe gas wouldn't burn, the kerosene stranded me with its noxious odor, the flu id "( uttered , burned blue, and went out. I ani alraid of the dark ; that ghostly black atw wiu'oh makes one's eyes ache " with its want of light . that palpable gloom which seems to beat like a roomful of palpitations of the heart around you, above you, about yon, everywhere ; that visible nothing, which holds the tables, the chain, the por traits you arc InuiUar with, yet hides them in its black veil from your view ; that emp ty fulness through which you thru6t oat your groping arms, then shrink back, op pressed with a presence you can neither near, see, nor fed. "Milly," I said to lay little maid, "run somewhere and get me a light." She ran to the grocer's wife, and came back with a penny dip in a brass candle stick. As she placed it on my table, went out and shut the door, the little boy in bronze on my mantle raised his hammer and struck the figure of time twelve ringing blows upon the heart. It was midnigt.t. The candle burned clearly. I resumed the old volume of Germ. in legends I wag reading, and as T laid my finger on a para graph, and paused to j Kinder on the poesibi 1 1 ty of spirits retu rot apt to earth to wreak vengeance on foes, or work weal to friends.

Iam come to tell you there arose a yell in Pande monium.

Infante were crawling into cor ners : thne vear old toddlers were tottering u t of the way. Older ones were hastily uu lmg seats, and all faces wore a listening xtwun.

Jf I cried, I was trotted; if I screamed, I was trotted ; if I was still, 1 was trotted ; I became little better than a human churn, from which the butter had been taken, and the sour milk left standing. My brains turned to bruises, my blood to whoy, my bones grew so sharp they almost pierced the knees which trotted them. As I began to cut teeth my tongue was constant ly jolted between my jaws, and in danger of being bitten off. f dared not whine, fori knew the penalty ; I began at last to calculate how long the "torture could possibly continue. Warm weather was coming on, and I thought one or the other of us must soon give up the ghost ; and as my nurse's exertions were almost sujierhuman, I imagined that per haps Imightoutlast her. One unlucky day, however, my mother entering the room un expectedly, I smiled at her. I had never done so before. "The darling," cried my parent, "see, it knows me. "Poor thing, rather," Faid the nurse, "it lias wind on its stomach !" "forthwith she proceeded to trot it out. Every thump of her foot on the floor wag, I knew, a nai' in my coffin. I felt I should never smile again. My faithful nurse con tinned her efi'jrts, and I was trotted out of existence on the poor old woman's knee." "As the speaker ceased, one of the older occupants of the room descried me,'' said my grandmother. "He at once made room for me to cntcr.and begged me to remain awhile aad hear the remarks. I consented, and took a seat near the entrance. "I," said a little fellow rising from his seat, with his blue eyes all bloodshot, and his curls matted together, "died of delirium tremens. At the age of six months, I was a confirmed drunkard. 1 had not been a very qaiet baby, and every time I was uneasy a little liquor was administered to do me good. I did not want wine, but water. I was nat urally a very thirsty ceild, and everything that was put lictween my sjieechless lips in creased my thirst. My mother's milk was sweet, the panada given me was sweet, and if now and then I was blessed with a draught of goat or cow's milk, it was warmed and sweetened first, to make it as much like my mothe r's as possible. I used to cry. No other wav do c poor Iwbies have of express ing our feelings, and the chances are ten to one that we will be misunderstood. To stop my crying, I was put to tho breast ; this, at such times, 1 would indignantly refuse. Then there would be a comnution. "Nurse," my mother would say, "what shall we do with him?" The nurse was a stout, hearty old woman, wbo always made a practice of tast ing whatever was provided fur her charge. I ler sovereitrn remedy was liquor. 1 was taken, and a spoonful administered at a time. At first I rebelled 1 strangled, kicked, and coughed. The firm hand held the spoon to my little tongue, and down went its contents in spite oi me. Little by little the dos; was increased. I soon likel it. In my thirsty moments I cried for it. It was given me readily ,for after a few moments of wild glee, I fell into a drunken stupor, which cave mv attendants many opportunities of enjoying themselves, as my sleep was sure to be long and sound. "At length mmnta a potu assailed me. Dur ing my whole life no-one had ever thought of giving me a single spoonful of the water I had craved the cooling, cheering.relreshing drop of water ! Now, L no longer cared for it. In my wildest frenzies 1 was accused of having the colic; down, as usual went the fiery drink, until finally 1 was literally b lrnt out. I was nothing but a cinder within, a shell without. My stomach was cooked to a crisp, my intestines were shrivelled my lungs no longer filled with pure air, belched forth only the fiery fumes t.int had consumed me. I died. I was good for nothing. I hone whutewr form tjr dost im lnntinel to take on earth, it will not be watered, as when f inhabited it, with alcohol.' "As this speaker ceased, there arose a wail of sympathy, such as had first attracted me to the pandemoniac chamber ; as it sub sided, another little figure had taken the stand 'My lege,' he said, 'brought me out of the world. My mother labored under the strange delusion that her child was born a llignlana laaaie, oi American parents anu in America. I was dressed.or felt undressed rath er, in short piaia stocKings, reaenmg to tnc calf of my leg, nnd an elegant kilt reaching just to the knee. My linihs were moulded in cherubic tonus, ana wnen cxposea in tne nursery were pretty. Hut the nursery was too narrow a field in which to display my beauty. On bitter cold days I was walked out over the icy streets, the keen wind chapping my flesh and chilling my blood till my knees looked like twin nutmeg graters painted purple. 1 ued to look at my mother s 1 ng comfortable skirts and leggings drawn up over warm hose, and wondered it she could survive a fashion such as 1 were, if adopted by herself. I became ailiicted with infliui- matory rheumatism, auu unanic to endure the pain, gave up the ghost.' "I lelt," mid my grandmother, "that this victim was a sacriGce to a fashion start ed since my day. 1 know that vour lather was never dressed in such a ridiculous style when a little boy, for with my own hands I knit his warm woolen stockings and saw that his comfortable little trousers came well over the instep of his little calfskin shoes. "The next speaker was a dreamy faced lit tle girl, who trembled as she rose and said " 'I am an opium cater. My death-warrant was written on the label of the first bot tle of Godfrey's Cordial brought into my mother's house. A few drops at first suf ficed to hush my feoblo cries. Then God frey's Cordial would not do. A few drops of pure laudanum was administered. Soon I could not go to eleep without it. Then my nurse would givo mc a small opium pill in my panada. Of course I was but little trouble. I was a deep sleeper, but my diges tion became impaired too much sleep weakened mc, and I knew no natural slum ber. My eyes became like those of a sleep walker, full of dreams when wide awake I lost my appetite : my neau grew lull ot min : mv baby heart was always aching closed my eyes one day forever on the home where I felt 1 could be little loved, when my low wails were never permitted to appeal to those around me, but were hushed at onoe , where my blue eyes were scarcely ever per mitted to look around in the world in which they had been opened, and where, instead of proper care and food and exercise, the bale fni nill nml enervating sleen were all that was offered mc. There arc many parents who srem to think children must pass their childhood 'out of the way,' and only get m the way when they have become, in spite of all sorts of ill-treatment, useful or ornament al members of society.' "This child was still speaking," said my grandmother, "when 1 rushed out. l had Hn n mother once, and I could not listen to these innocents m that fcarlut waumg chamber, recapitulating the woes that Had sent them there, any longer."

SEASONABLE HINTS ABOUT PERSONAL COMFORT. A thin shawl may be made warm by fold ing a newspaper inside of it. The paper is impervious to the wind and cold air from outside,and prevents tho rapid cscapo of tho warm air from beneath it. Every one knows that the heat of the body is carried off much more rapidly in a high wind than in a calm. The wind blows away the heat evolved from the bady ; but in a perfectly still air this heat remains, and constitutes an atmospher ic envelope so nearly of the ainc tempera ture with the body itself, that the latter in not so quickly robbed of its natural heat. There are some interesting facts about the body in its power to niako and contain heat, which are familiar to all, when told, but which aro seldom thought of in daily expe rience. For example, the body will hold a great deal more heat than it gets from its own furnaces. The stomach is a furnace, and our food is tho fuel. It keeps up a uni form tcmperatii! e in tho blood eaual to about 98 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. If tho stomach could consume food fast enough tn maintain that heat, the body could not be frozen by any extreme of cold. But in proportion to the severity of cold to which the body is exposed, is the rapidity with which it loses heat. Some substances taken into the stomach make a hot blaze much sooner than others, as brandy. To put brandy in the stomach is liko putting pitch under a steam boiler. It soon burns out, and the greater heat injures the furnace. Wu say that the body will hold more heat than it gets from its own furnaces. Heat is measured by degrees. On going out from a warm room, the body will immediately begin to lose its heat, ani it must part with a cer- ain number ot degrees uelorc it can to begin to feel cold. The direction has sometimes been given " Don't hug the ttove, if you are going to set out on a cold journey." lint experience says do hug it. Get in as many degrees of heat as you can carry, if it is 500. Then wrap your self up well, and you can economize these 500 degrees through a long ride. But if you had taken only 100 degrees at tho start, they would have been exhausted mid-way of the journey, and then you would have be gun to feel cold. Nevertheless, it is an un healthy habit to accustom one's self on or dinaryocensions to moro heat than is actually needed. This is a very common fault and bearson the pocket as well as on the health. One may easily get the habit of rtquiring two or three moro blankets on a bed than are necessary. Some families will bum twice the fuel that others do, and en joy less comfort. The extremities of the body get cold first, often to a painful degree, while the trunk is warm. But so long as the trunk keeps warm, in a person of common vigorous heilth, there is little fear of "catching cold" by aching toes or fingers. In rail car riding, it is much safer for the health to let the toes ache, than to allow tho lungs to feed on the foul air around the stove. When you fret out on a winter journey, if you are liable to sutler from cold toes, which many jople do in spite of "rubbers," fold a piece of newspaper over your stocking, which you can rapidly do, i' your books or shoes are not irrationally tight. This is better than "rubber," which are, in fact, very cold comforters in extreme, while they make the feet sweat in moderate weather. The main use of India rubber overshoes is to keep -out water, and for that they are second only to a stout water-proof, first-rate calf skin boot. There is not a more villainously unwhole some article of wear made thau the high topped rubber boot, It makes tho foot tend er, especially in children, it gives mi ugl,y gait, And wnen leliofrm iiny wentlier, tho wearer is liable to"catch cold." Saint Crisp in is the best ftiend of the human foot, when his leather and stitches are honest. Although the body can take in a greater number of degrees of heat that it gets from its own furnace, the stomach, yet its capaci ty is limited in this respect. For example, when the hand is warui, you cannot hold it in the air of a hot oven for a second; but when it is cold, and especially damp also, you may hold it 'here for some time without feeling the heat very sensibly, and for a long time without being obliged to withdraw it. And so of the whole body. It appears then that the body may carry less, as well as more heat, than the quantity supplied by its own furnace. Its extremities and its surface often become painfully cold. Tn winter, a traveler occasionally finds in a hotel a deficiency of bed covering ; or in the sensitiveness of disease, he may require more than in health. The newspaper for which he paid two cents on the cars, spread under the upper cover will be equal to an additional blanket. A piece of silk oil-cloth, stitched in the folds "of a fchavl,' ia more flexible than the pa per, and will last a whole winter. It has tho advantage of hecuring inward warmth with out tho additional weight ol a thicker gar ment. The constitutional vivacity and temper of a parson has much to do with his endurance of cold. For this vivacity is a sort of nerv ous fire that lessens the sensibility to out ward impressions. An indifferent, milk-and-water person, without energy and force of will, is at the mercy of every cold blast that sweeps round the corner. He, and especial-J ly she, has no defence but to wear a dozen shawls during the day, and sleep under a bale of blankets at night. One without any mental purpose, (nnfortunately there arc such,) though in vigorous health, is much more liable to catch cold than a spir ited delicate body bent on some positive pur suit. In this world of changeable climates, there aro not a few peoplo who got in tho habit of boing annoyed by any weather that is in the slightest degree adverse to their present caprice. Tn winter, they don't iiko winter ; in summer, they prefer autumn ; and in autumn, spring is tho moat delightful season of the year. A snow storm in August would be charming, but in its proper season it is a perfect nuisanco. For such pooplo, we aro incapablo of writing any useful hints. We hope they will succeed in doing what they have set out to do, until they aro pun ished into acquiescence with all tho seasons. ol tho year that is, in making themselves comfortable, no matter what wind blows, or what sun shines.

BURLIXCTOX : FRIDAY MORNING, DEC. 7, 1SG0. From the Daily of Nov. 2S. THANKSGIVING. To-morrow three millions of happy families, scatteicd over Ucenlij broad states, keep Thanksgiving. To-day the trains run loaded with returning wanderers from the paternal roof tree. Tho joyful scenes of rc-union, which wo can imagine though we can't des cribe them .arc under full headway to-night. What a good time it is ! This yearly recurring festival means somo thing, if tho reader will stop to think of it. And thinking of it ourselves, it occurs to us to say, that among other things it implies and is solely possible for, a people possessing homes. The Parisian, whoso languaze has no word for homo, can have no idea of Thanksgiving either. It is not a religious observance simply, or it would be confined to the services in the churches. It is not a ge leral public rejoicing.or it would bo public ly celebrated in great concourses of tho People. It is not a harvi st festival, or it would take placo in harvest time. No, it is something different from and more than these. After the out door labors of the year are over, after the amber treasures of the wheat field and the golden ingots of the corn have been garnered, when the most inclement season of tho year has begun, and the days are grow ing short,when the enjoyments and comforts of life are those of the fireside and the home, then it is that wc reunite tho severed links of the family circle, and feel it most if any link has dropped ; then clasping the dear well known hands,and smiling into tho fond familiar faces, without the check of the strangei 's presence, we celebrate our New England jubilee. It is tho Festival of Home. Let us all, then, with devout gratitude to God, for the countless blessings which clus ter round these our christian homes, join in the Feast of St. Jonathan ; and let us try to make other homes, less blessed, happy like wise. Let us, as we " eat the fat and drink the weet," not forget also, to "send to those for whom nothing has been provided." Stocks are uncertain, now-a-days ; try an in vestment under the vest of your poor neigh bor ; see how you can walk into his affec tions with a leg of mutton ; spare for him at least a spare-rib ; show him the connection between piety and pumpkin pie ; if ho don't understand English, " talk turkey " to him he will understand that. So shall tho day be a good and happj- one for you, dear reader, and many returns of it may you see. CoxsciExi E Stricken. Exp or a Bank Case. Some three years ago a packnj;o of foreign money vnn deposited in tlio North Hank of tliiH city by JI Mara. S. Itolnnson A Son, flour deulers. Tho next duy they nro notified that the Suffolk Bank had returned the "strap" marked "two hundred dollars short." The firm examined their cash ac count very carelully. and finding the figures all correct, felt satified that the mistake oc curred in one of tho banks above named. Ac cordingly a demand was mado on the Norti Bank lor tho money, which was refused an! a suit was brought to recover tho amount ; which created some stir among the banks at the time, and led them to adopt a new regu lation in regard to their responsibility on the count of foreign money deposited with them. The suit was decided in favor of the Bank, though it was thought by some that tho rul ing of the judge leaned to the other side. Last Saturday Mr. Robinson received a note requesting him to call at tho Suffolk Bank. He did so, and was handed a letter, of which the following is a copy : Sir This package of 236 belongs to the gentleman (1 think his name is Bobiuson), who sued you a while ago for $200 and lost the case. If you will return this S2')U and nterest which I took from him, you will Greatly oblige, The money was undoubtedly taken after t was deposited, and tho responsibility of the loss rests probably on the Suffolk Bank, as the above anonymous opistlo was addressed to that institution, and tho Cash ior this morniiiji paid the money to Mr. Bobinson. Thus ends one of the many curious cases of Missing Money m btate street. uoston Transcript . The N. Y. Commercial Adverlissr's Wash ington correspondent, "Omicron," under date of Nov. 22, writes as follows : It was remarked, a few days before tho 'residential election, by an eminent citizen of the South, himself a pro-slavery man of the strictest sort, that he hoped Lincoln would be elected, because it would test tho question whether wo had a government or not. His idea was that if tho Southern States could with impunity and at their pleasure, in a moment of passion or caprice, withdraw lrom tho Lnion, anu make coali tions with each other or with foreign powers, then wc had no government. The Southern States had threatened all this,nnd ho wanted the experiment tried. If wo have no govern ment tho experiment will succeed ; any Stato may witnuraw ut pleasure not one ot tho original thirteen States only, but any of those States whoso territory wc havo bought. The question has been brought boloro President Buchanan, whether wo havo a government or not. So far as it depends upon him we havo none at all. He will not. as is generally believed to-day ,lilt a finger or say a word for the maintenance ot tno gov ernment when the crisis arrives. Had ho taken any distinct and decided ground m support of the government against rebellion or secession, he would not now nave nau a full Cabinet. There is no longer any dan ger of a Cabinet rupture, because there is no danger that tho President will put anything in his message that will bo unfavorable to tne secessionists. Tho views presented by General Joseph 1ino. in favor of Stato secession, show that ho was not misunderstood by tho country, How Mr. Breckinridge stands unon the ques tion, sinco tho election, wa do not know, but a few weeks hence the wholo subject will be befora Congress. Somo sunnoso that tho coming session will be one of preat excitement and disorder Among tho Democrats there will be much of mutual crimination and denunciation.

WARD'S AUBURN SPEECH The Republicans of Auburn had a public demonstration on the result of the election Tuesday night of last week. Of course, the Wide-A wakes marched in procession to tho house of Senator Seward, and called him out for a speech. He answered as follows : Gentlemen, Uldc-Aivalcs, Fdlow-Citizem, Friends and Neighbors; This is not exactly according to contract. Wo parted lost at midnight, you remember : it was at tho Court House. Tho day the Gth of this month. Doubtful, perhaps, whether it was not the 'th. Wo were receiving election returns. The First AVard, Republican ; Second Ward Republican; Third Word Republican; Fourth Ward, astounding Republican. Cheers Hurrah for the Fourth Ward.J That is right. The Fourth Ward deserves it. Give tho ard three more. Three more wcro given. I 'ow I think of it, the First Ward deserves as many. Six cheers wero given for the First Ward. Well, then camo the news from the several towns, cheering, glorioua.magnificent, and tho scattering returns from other towns, Counties and States. I told you the Stato was Republican by 50,000 ; tbat Abraham Lincoln was President ; that you would not need mc to rejoice longer with you.

They would not let their adversaries sleep before tho election. Their menus must no: expect to rest undisturbed after the elcctitn. Cheers and laughter. Fellow-citizens, you have a right to re joice. I remenoer that I thought it an oc casion lor rejoicing, when the go.w cause we now maintiir. carried one ward in the city, one or two.or three towns in the country and the State of Vermont alone in the wholo country. But now who will deny our right to rejoice when it carries all the wards m the city, all the towns in the county, all the counties in the State where its argu ment is fairly heard, and practically all the States in the Union which allow, in fact, fwe speech, free debates, free ma -Is, and f:8J and universal suffrage. It is the earnest (f its universal acceptance. Cheers. liut thero is still greater reason to rejoice in the manner in which this success has been won. It is tho verdict of a People lor a Principle the Republican Principle the true Democratic principle of Equal and Ex act justice to all men. Cheers It is a verdict rendered purely on conviction, without passion or interest. Not a Repub lican vote in tho United States has been pro cured through terror, not one by bribery or corruption. Nay, every vote has been given in resistance of intimidation and corruption. Cheers I do not charge that the Fusion, votes or other opposition votes were largely given under such appliances. But the record of the canvass remains, and "bears its testi mony that the main argument of those par ties was their menace of Disunion, and last relianco was money at the Polls.

It will supply a want long felt. Tho Legislature of Vermont has refused to rc poal tho Personal Liberty act of that State. Tho vote to repeal was 5S, (23 Republicans, 33 Dem ocrats); tuo votos against repealing were Vlo, (all Republicans). A'. Y. Tnbuni, Nov. 30th. Tho Tribune is not quite correct. No vote was taken directly in cither House on tho question of repealing tho personal liberty act. A bill for such repeal was introduced on tho 7th of November, by Mr. Thomas of West Fairlee, tho leading Democrat of the House. It was referred to a select commit teo of three, constituted (by the Speaker) of tico Democrats and one Republican. A la bared report, the authorship of which is as cribed to a high democratic quarter, was mado by the majority of the committee in favor of the bill. It came up on the last night of the session, and Mr. Thomas made the only speech on tho subject, and a pretty good speech too, for him. A motion to dis miss the bill followed, and it was dismissed by tho voto which is given by the Tribune, 12o voting to dismiss and 58 against dismis sion.' it is not lair, however, to assnine that all those 5S would have 'voted to repeal". We think that several of the Republicans who voted against dismission (perhaps because they wished to debate the question) would not have voted for the bill. In the Senate no repealing act was intro duced. Tho main action bearing on the sub ject, was the introduction by the solitary de mocratic Senator, of a resolution, instructing the committee, appointed to revise the statutes of this state, to examine all laws bearing upon tho condition of fugitive slaves and report at the next session of the legisla ture whether any of those provisions, and what ones, are in conflict with the constitu tion of the United States. On this very proper resolution, onebhort speech was made by Senator Woodbridgc. He said that no State was more sound upon the vexed ques tions of the day than Vermont no S;ate so ready to guarantee to every Stat e iu the Un ion the rights which aro protected there by the constitution and laws of the United States, no State in the Union more determined to go for freedom and for free men, or more determined to have that territory, which is open to all, trod only by the feet of freemen He was sure that if there v.-as any statute on our books in conflict with the constitution, the people would like to know it, and it was time they knew it ; consequently he favored the resolution, and it was adopted. One of the causes why in a revolution the most violent party increases and govern", is. that it has all the cowards for recruits. So said Monsieur Villemain. when accounting for the ascendency of the "Holy Guillotine" in those terrible days for France which are known as the Days of Terror. The observation is jut-t.and it contains the seeret(which every body knows, by the way) of the only source of danger to this country from the Southern secessionists. The secession leaders are the most violent men of the South, and being bold, unscrupulous, and fanatical, they may succeed in doin much, ovil simply because, should they once get fairly agoing, they will liuTeall Uie eovmruaiti the South for recruits. The peaeeubly disponed population at that section, comprising, it is probable, nine tenths of tho wholo people there, will be overcrowed by the other tenth, which shall comprise the lawless spirits of the time and place, and be led by men of rude energy. ierror converts men into tyrants ana brutes, and the secessionists are master hands at terrifying their fellow citizens ; or else why are there so many persons banished from the south who are quite incapable ot injuring anybody ? Were fair play to be had in the bouth, not even the palmetto btate would go for secession ; but tho men of vio lence have got the upper hand there, and the rest of the community J .ire not speak their sentiments, and many of them, perhaps, are as violent in their words and actions as if they were sufficiently moon-struck to believe in Palmetto flags, and rattlesnakes, and the lune star. If the secession question were to be submitted to the South Carolinians, and tho voting were to take place in the Palace of Trnth, the tyrants would le as decisively voted down as we have seen iwiubalino voted down in Naples, or as we know tho Vene tians would vote down Kaiser t ranz-doset, could they once get his imperial and imperi ous claims under a hot fire of paper bullets' Six months ago, Naples was. apparently, as loyal to trancis 11. as south Carolina now is to the secession leaders, and yet we know that more than 1.300,000 Neapolitans have just voted against him, and not 11,000 for U1U1, eiCll lllUUCVfcl.

It is, therefore, pos sible that they may do some evil, and that the moro easily beeause President iucnanan is as much afraid of them as if ho were liv ing in Charleston, and not in ashmgton. There is boldness on the ore side, and timid ity on the other, and boldness ever carries the day when ti has none to combat but tho timid, who nro really non-combatants, and throw their weight into the scale of tyrants, so far as they have any weight to throw any where.

VISIT. The snfo return home of the young Prince of Wales, naturally caused much rejoicing in Knghind. Tbscourtcous treatment which lie met with in the United States called out grateful acknowledgements on every hand. The speech of Lard P.ilmerston is a sufficient index of tho general character of them all. At a public banquet in London. Lord Palmnrston thus alluded to the reception of the Prince of Wales in America : You have alluded to an event which has awakened tho deepest interest in the mind of Wiry Eoglisbmau. I mean the visit of the 'rince of Wales to the North American Con inent. It was to be expected that when the frit n hr.ru. nf Knwl.ind visited tho SllbieCtS of Her Majesty in our North American Prov inces, he would be r.ceived with that enthu siastic affection which becomes a loyal and attached people. Our anticipations have not be n disappointed. The reception of the Prince has been worthy of the people who gave it, and honorable to the family of which hn i n (!irin-Miihed -a member ; and we may hope thatUiat visit will cement moro closely those ties wnicn, t trust, uru uin- wind h hind trvflther that portion of tho Queen's dominions and the mother country.

But I must say it has been most gratifying to wit ness the cordiality , the heartfelt kindness, tho generous hospitality, and I may say the en thusiastic delight with which that illustri ous Prince was welcomed by our cousins in the United States. (Cheers.) They have shown themselves, indeed, to be a noble and generous people they have shown that they have not forgotten the common stock from which they and we have sprung ; and, in spite of events which, if not buried in ob livion, might have produced somo slight alienation between u, they received our fu ture sovereign and I trust that future may be long distant they received the eldest son of our gracious Sovereign, not as if he were a stranger belonging to another land, but-as if he had been born in their own cauntry, j and had been a citizen ol their own Repub lic.

The ex cellence of a good covering of snow lor the protection of plants in winter, i3 beyond question, but il "G. B. II." will place his thermometer in a snow bank during steady cold won ther, say of zero or lower, he will find his doctrine that snow never talis oc low 32", will not stand the test. Of course the enow will not rise above 32 Fahrenheit, because it melts at that temperature . "In our climate many plants and shrubs, natives of warmer latitudes, require protec tion olsomTsort during the severe winters. The bet protection possible and and the on ly one necessary, if it could be relied on with anycertaini.1, " . bines all desirable qualities for protection. i. :.kki- nivnma mid warm. It may seem absurd to many to speak of snow as warm, but comparatively speaking, this is true. As the tcinprature of snow never falls below tho freezing point, it follows that with an air temperature ot zero or 323 below tho freezing point, that snow can fairly be called a warm covering. But as snow never Jails below 32a so it never rises aiore it, and thi3 equability of temperature gives it great valuo as a protection to plants. But while warm it is also porous, admitting air and affording ventilation to many plants, which with any covering entirly excluding air, would rot or damp off. But tho trouble is that wo arc never safe in depending upon a sufficient quantity of snow, and thcrelore we must cm ploy otner materials for this purpose. Straw, spent tan, sawdust, stable litter, leaves, ever green bonghs, arc all-used and are all good bus not equally good for all thinga. Par Tink3 and similar plants, sawdust, tan and leaves wo do not consider as good as straw, which afTords sufficient protectien and abund ant ventilation if not spread too thickly. mot plants coarse stable litter is pro bably the most convenient and best covering. It should not be so thick aa to be liable to heat much. In the spring tho finer part may be forked into the ground and the coareer re moved. If leaves are employed, a little soil or some other material must bo thrown over them to prevent them from being blown away. For shrubs, if very small, a few evergreen bonghs thrown over them, will form an ex cellent protection. If large, tho branches should bo drawn closely together nnd then wound with straw. Climbing plants, if tender, must bo detached from the trellis or wall, wound with straw, or laid upon the ground and covered with loaves or earth. NOIITII AND SOUTHTHE DIF FERENCE PRACTICALITY SET FORTH. In the Sixth Avenue is a grocer who is do ing a good business by attending to his own atfiirs ; and who regularly as the election comes round, votes the Republican ticket. One of bis customers, a nativoof tho suniest part of tho South, where tho palmetto wave and persimmons are commonest product, but who is a resident of this city, was in his es tablishment a few days since. The conver sation was upon the late election and its re sults ; when the latter, after some declama tion, proceeded to consign the President elect, the Republican party, and each and every member of it, to that undiscovered country recently and specially brought to public attention by "glorious DIckBusteed," in his stated Staten Island harangue. The grocer withstood his farrago some time, but finally his patience was exhausted. Stepping out before his counter, he addressed the other : "Mr. A., suppose that I, a Republican, as you know, should be now in your native city of Charleston, and should make use of such language, and express sentiments as adverse to secession and secessionists, as you do to the Republican party, what would thoso wno heard me do to me V 'Cut your heart out, hang you to tin nearest lamp-post, and serve you right," said this scion of "the finest chivalry in tho world." "Well," replied the grocer, "wo arc not so blood thirsty up hero at the North. We only kick our insulters off our premises." Suiting the action to the word, he seized Mr. A. by the collar, whirled him round so as to face the door, nnd applied the energetic I'M a lergo, forcibly ejecting mm lrom tne nremiacs. and illustrating tho difference be tween northern and southern customs.
