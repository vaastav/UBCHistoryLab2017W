All interest centers upou the prosecution ot what is known as the "Dudley case." The opinion is openly exjmssvU about the Court House that flo indictment will certainly bo returned hi this case. The positive instructions of the court (District Judge Woods) reUtuifc to the violation or the advico to others to violate the election laws is what convinces many that the jury will find a bill against Col. Dudley. A United States Marshal warrant for hi* arrest was issued two days after the publication of the "blocks of live" letter said to have been written by Dudley.

The Annunl Report of Attorney General Gnrlnud Submitted to ConfrtM. Washington, Dec. 5.?Attorney General Garland has made his annual report to Congress of the business of the Department of Justice during the last fiscal year, together with statistics of crime ugainst the United States, and a statement of the business of the Supreme Court und the Court of Claims. The petitions filed in .the latter court in French spoliation cases number representing 2,380 vessels and about$30,000,000. The majority of theso cases have been disposed of so far as the court is conccrncd, atfd have been certified to Congress. The remainder will bo reported to Congress during the present session. After making a detailed statement in regard to the character and resu't of litigation in which the United States was a party during the year, tho Attorney General says that tho usual examination of penitentiaries in which Uuited States prisoners are confined was made during the year and showed the institutions to be in good condition and the prisoners wnlt ennui fnr mid hiimntmlv t rented. IIo advocates the passage of tho bill now pending In congress for tho appointment of a commission to inquire mto the ad* visabUity oi building Government penitentiarieH and reformatories and says: "It would seem that the United States should have model prisons and reformatories of its own in which to confine its criminals, and provision could be made (or the employment of the inmates at some suitable industries on a system of labor which would not violate the recent act of Congress, nor be inconsistent with tho laws passed by tho several .States and the prevailing opinions relative to the subject of contract labor." There were wcrti l,875Governmentprisoners in custody during the year. Tho Attorney General suggests that tho Departmentof Justice to be^iveu entire control over the jail in the District of Columbia, and that a separate building for the confinement solely of female prisoners be added to that building. He also recommends that the salary of the warden be increased to $2,500 "per annum. He calls attention to tho method of summoning grand and trial juries in the Territorial district courts in cases in which the United States is a party and renews the suggestions thereon, contained iu his last annual report. He <tlur> ur.n.u on urn itvi nriiif inn fnr flu> restoration and preservation of court records, and in advocating certain changes in tho judicial system of the United States, nays: "It is impossible to over-estimate the necessity that exists for a change in the judicial system to meet the demands,of the constantly increasing business of the country; anu I would simply cull attention in this connection to my suggestions in the last report, and respectfully urge some change be made that will remedy the evils complained of on all sides, whether that change ho in accordance with my views or not." He renews tho recommendation contained in former reports that a proper building for the accommodation of the Supreme Court and other courts and commissions of the United States, as well us for the increasing business of the Department of J usttco, be erected on the publicgrounds adjoining the present building. lie also renews his recommendation of last year that provision be made for the purchase of-portraits of Justices of tho Snnrmitn flmtrt III M'trnrd to the DflV meat of special deputy marshals the Attorney General says: "The appropriation for the current tiscal year for fees anil expenses of marshals is ?075,000. but by a special provision incorporated to appropriation act only $300,00.' can be advanced to the marshals. Numerous special deputy marshals were appointed under the laws provided therefor, to serve at the recent elections. # To way this will require a large buui, and if their pay bo taken from the appropriation above mentioned, nothing will remain for the expenses of the service of process, and the business of the United .States courts over the country will be seriously impeded. I recommend that a special appropriation be made to pay these deputies." Other specific recommendations are that marshals be allowed increased expenses in the service of process arising out of the enforcement of tbe InterState commerce law; that the fees or salaries of Marshals be readjusted in accordance with previous recommendations; that the employment of substitute attorneys in the territories be authorized; that the salaries of the Examiner of Claims in the Department of State, Assistant Attorneys in the Department of Justice and the Chief Clerk of that Department be increased, and for a general reorganization of the clerical force of the Department on a basis commensurate with its vast and increasing business. _ \\\m A l'KKMANKNT

GIGANTIC ltAILBOAD SCHEME. A Plan of Consolldatlou That ISeaU Jay Gould's Trust Scheme. Chicago, Dec. 5.?The Timet thii t morning says: It is repOrtecTlhat Eastern capitalists have been for some time considering a scheme that is of much greater magnitude than the collapsed clearing house arrangement. It provides for the crcation of a syndicate ' which is to secure a controlling interest in all Western roads and manage them as one system. A gentleman well informed in railroad affairs, but who prefers to be nameless in this connection, said yesterday: "The clearing house scheme, or whatever way bo substituted for it, is in* 1 tended to be only a makashift?a tempoI rary ailair put forth as u 'feeler,' you might say?sotnethiug to prepare the public mind for the introduction of a 1 broader and more effective plan for putting an end to rate wars and revolution ary railway management. I happen to , know that the ultimate aim and purpose ' of the capitalists who have been in con' sultation in New York is to form a great railroad syndicate und mass all the roads i west of Chicago and St. Louis under the controlling power. The organization is to be a gigantic stock company, and stockholdera will be guaranteed, say 5 per cent on their stocks, so that while it wi.'l amount practically to a consolidation of all the roads, it will iu reality be nothing more than a leasing of the vurious lines.

President 11. It. Cable, of the Itock Island, was asked what lie thought of the proposed plan. "I haven't considered it," he replied. "In fact, I don't know anything about such a plau, except that something of the kind has been hinted at iu the gossip from the Kast. I don't believe tnere is auy truth in it."

No amendment was offered, but Mr. Sherman said he had very grave doubts us to the practicability of applying these sections without encouraging fraud.

Adelaide?near where I now am?is i city of over one hundred thousand in habitants and is without question tlx Queen City of Australia, anil very mucl resembles the city of Cleveland; no fur a shade trees ure concerned the might b< called the "Forest City."

Many of the citizens have summe residences in these bills or mountains where, at a distance of fifteen or twenty miles from the heated city, they find t nf tnixniirntiirn of from mlnon ti twenty degrees every evening. Thesi residences are built of Btone unci liiaiij of them models of beauty. Anion] tlieui those of Sir William' Milne, Si Thomas Elder, Mr. J. W. Bakewell, tin Hon. Henry Scott, M. L.

Tht well kept and lovely flower gardens at tached to each, the beautiful plain an< city below, and wide sea view make tin residences perfectly charming. Jn tin i suburbs of the city there are some beau tiful orange, almond aud olive orchards besides apples, lemons, peaches, pears plums, figs, apricots, loquet or Japai , plum grapes, and all kinds of smal i fruits seem to flourish in this climate i which is very much like that of South era California.

The vessels are of huge proportion ' and carry immense freight* and Jarj ' passenger list*. Many ot theui are pall , tiul and some carry over six thousan : tons. They come into the Gulf of S Vincent going to and coming from Enj land, France und Germany, to Me bourne and Sydney and stop adayt more taking in and discharging freight ' also exchanging the mails. Tho Gu presents a lively appearance at tho tim f ot arrival and sailing of these diiferer lines of steamers. The time from Adt ' laide to London, touching at Ahbani Columbo, Aden and Suez, is from thirtj ' to thirty-five days.
