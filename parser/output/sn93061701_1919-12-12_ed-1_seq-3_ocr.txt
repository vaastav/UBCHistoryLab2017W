if SON MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS MAKES MANY IMPORTANT OMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS. REC- WILSON WARNS REDS FINANCIAL SYSTEM MUST CHANGED, SAYS THE PRESIDENT. BE Weaurn Nswapaper Union Newa 8rvlr. The President'! message to Congress Tuesday follows: To tlio Senate and House of Repre sentatives: I sincerely regret tliat I cannot be present at the opening of tills session of the Congress. I am thus prevented from presenting In as direct a way as I could wish the many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept In close touch with affairs In their de tail and whose thoughtful recommend ations I earnestly second. In the matter of the rnilnds and the readjustment of their affairs grow ing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of address Ins you. Urges National Budget. I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a bud get system. That there should be one slngel authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not in dependently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure properly related to tiio nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of prepar ing the budget must, in the nature of the cane. If the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated . Instead of divided, rest upon the exeeu utlve. The budget so prepared should be submitted to and approved or amend ed by a single committee of each house of Congress and no single appropria tion should be made by the Congress, except such as inuy have been Includ ed In the buclgst prepared by the ex ecutive of added by the particular com mittee of Congress charged with the budget legislation. Permanent Tenure of Office. Another and not less Important aspect of the problem Is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing luw the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations. No one Is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, econom ically and effectively. The auditors should be highly (rained officials with permanent ten ure In the Treasury Department, free of obligations to or motives of consid eration for this or any subsequent ad ministration and authorized and em powered to examine Into and make re port upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the government. Their reports should be inude to the Con gress and to the secretary of the treasury. I trust that the Congress will give lis Immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Slmpll . fication of the income and profit taxes has become an immediate neces sity. These taxea performed Indispen sable service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer Inconvenience and expense, but In order that his lia bility may be made certain and defi nite. Questions of Tax In Peace Time. With reference to the details of the revenue law, the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of In ternal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable in con nection with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support It Is of the utmost Importance that In dealing with this matter the pres ent law should not he disturbed bo far as regards taxes for the calendar year 19M, payable In the calendar year 1921. The Congress might well consider whether the higher rates of Income and profits taxes can In peace times be effectively productive of revenue and whether they may not. on the con trary, be destructive of business ac tivity and productive of waste and in efficiency. There Is a point at. which In peace tiroes high rates of income and prof its taxes discourage energy, remove the Incentive to new enterprise, en courage extravagant expenditures and produce industrial . stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils. America's Position, The problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has takes place with reference, to the position of Aroer- j lea In the world's affairs. The n re In dies and passions engendered by dec- I adea oT controversr between two schools ot political ana economic thought the one believes In protec tion of American industries, the other believes in tariff for revenue only must be subordinated to the single consideration of the public Interest ia the light of latterly changed condi tions. . Before the war America was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world, and the Interest payroenta she bad to make to foreign countries ota Ameri can securities beJd abroad, the expen ditures of the American travelers abroad and the ocean freight charges she had to pay to others, a host bal anced the ralne of Tier pre-war favor able balance of trade. During the war America '8 exports have been greatly stimulated, and Increased prices have, increased their value. On the other hand, she has pur chased a large proiwrtion of the Amer ican securities previously held abroad; lias loaned some $0,000,000,000 to for eign governments, und has built her own ships. Our favorable balance of trade has thus been greatly Increased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting It heretofore exist ing. To Develop Market. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace times: liy imports into this country of gold or of goods, or by establishing new credits. Europe is iu no position at I lie present time to ship gold to us nor could we contem plate lurge further imports of gold Into this country without concern. The time has nearly passed for In ternational government loans and it will take time to develop In this coun try a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend to prevent foreign countries from set tling for our exports by shipments of goods Into this country could only have the effect of preventing them from paying for our exports und therefore of preventing the exports from being made. The productivity of the country, greatly stimulated by the war, must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent imports will Inevitably curtail exports, force curtailment of produc tion, loud the bunking machinery of the country with credits to carry un sold products and produce Industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to sell, we must be prepared to buy. America Greatest Capitalist in World. Whatever, therefore, may have been our views during the period of growtli of American business concerning tar iff legislation, we must now adjust our own economic life to a chunged condition growing out of the fact that American business Is full grown mid that America is the greatest capitalist iu the world. No policy of Isolation will satisfy the growing needs and opportunities of America. The provincial standards and policies of the past, which have held American business as if in a straightjacket, must yield and give way to the needs and exigencies of the new day in which we live, a day full of hope and promise for Ameri can business, if we will hut take ad vantage of the opportunities that ure ours for the asking. The recent war has ended our Iso lation and thrown upon its a great duty and responsibility. The United Slates must share the expanding world ina;et. The United States desires for itself only equal opportunity with the other nutions of the world, and the process of friendlq cooperation und foreign competition so the legit imate Interests of nil nations concerned may be successfully and equitably ud Justed. Must Give Relief to Returned vanKS. There are other matters of Import ance upon which I urged action at the last session of Congress which are Htlli pressing for solution. I am sure It Is not necessary for me again to remind you that there Is one Immediate and very practicable question resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It Is a mat ter of recognition ami relief to our sol diers. I ran do tin better (ban to quote from my lust niessugu urging this very action : "We mrat see to It lhat our return ing soldiers are assisted In every prac ticable way to find the plnces for which they are fitted In the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and maintaining upon an adequate scale the admirable organiza tion created by the Department of I-a-hor for placing- men seeking work ; and It ran also be done, In at least one very great field, by creating new opportunities for individual enterprise. Urges Support for Secretary's Plans. "The secretary of the Interior has pointed out the way In which return ing soldiers may be helped to fund and take up land In the hitherto un developed regions of the country which the federal government already has prepared or can readily prepare fori cultivation and also on many of the cut over or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shsll receive the Immediate and substantial support of Congress, In the matter of tariff legislation, I beg to call your attention to the state ments contained In my last message urging legislation with reference to the establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs Industry In America : Dependence Interrupted Trade. "Among the Industries to which spe cial consideration should he given Is that of the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our entire de pendence upon German supplies Itefore the war made the interruption of trade a cause for exceptional economic dis turbance. The clone relation hefveen the manufacture of dyestuff, on the one hand, and of explosives and poi sonous gases o the other, moreover, has given the industry an exceptional significance and, value. "Although the.. United States will gladly and unhesitatingly Join in the program of International disarmament, it will, nevertheless, he a policy of ob vious prudence to make certain of the maintenance of many strong and well- equipped chemical plants.- The Germs n chemical Industry, with which we will be bron,,t competition, was, and wr" Rain. morouiniiy snu monopoly capable of exercising a com petition of a peculiarly Insidious and dangerous kind." During the war the farmer per formed a vital and willing etrrice to the nation. By materially Increasing the prodoctloa of his land h sh-m, riled America and the allies with tl-e creased amounts of food nee -" rv to keep their Immense armies in the field. He Indispensably helped to wla the war. But there Is now scarcely less needs of Increasing the production In food and the Decessaries of life, t ask the Congress to consider mean of en rourarlng effort, alone these llnea.' Give Boost for Better "tea dm. The seed of doing everything poasi- I ble to promote production along eco- nomlcal lines, to Improve marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful. Is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the Congress by the secretary of ag- riculture, to secure the essential facts required for the study of .tills ques tion, through the proposed enlarged programs for farm management stud ies and crop nnd estimates. I would urge, also, the continuance of federul participation in the buildin? of good rouds, under the terms of ex isting lnw and under the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on the part of states and tbf federal government to preserve and develop our forest reservolrc and sup ply through the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses of study along the lines related to rural prob lems; nnd fuller provision for sanita tion in rural districts and the build ing up of needed hospital and medic:.! facilities In these localities. Political Restlessness. Perhaps the way might be cleared for many of these desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensive survey made of rural conditions by a conference com posed of representatives of t lie farm ers and of the agricultural agencies re sponsible for leadership. I would call your alien! ion to t' e widespread condition of political rest lessness In our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while varloiu and complicated, are superficial rnlei than deep seated. Proudly, they arise from or are connected with the fail ure on 1 lie part of our government to arrive speedily nt a Just and perma nent peace permitting return to iioitnu! conditions, from the transfusion of rad ical theories from seething European centers pending such delay, from heart less profiteering resulting In the In crease in the cost of living, and, lavtly, from the machinations of passiomui and malevolent r gltators With the return to normal condi tions, tills unrest will rapidly disap pear. In the meantime '. does innc'i evil. It seems to me that In dealing with this sltiia."'iii CongnMs should not be Impntlent or drastic, but should seek rntlur to renin iii causes. Courts Should Deal With Radicals. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a pence bnsi. witli ameliorated living conditions u I der the minimum of restrictions upon personal liberty that Is consistent Willi our reconstruction problem. Anil It should "inn the federal erverni nut Willi powr to deal In Its ciri.iniil courts Willi those persons tvh i by vio lent methods would ubrogate the tlnie- tesled Institutions. With the free expression of opinion nnd with the udvocacy of orderly po litical change, however fundamental, there must bo no Interference, but to wards passion and malevolence tend ing to Incite crime and Insurrection under guise of political evolution there should be no leniency. Legislation to tills end tins been recommended by the attorney general mid should be enacted. In this Clrect connection I would call your attention to my recnti'.nte-nd.i-tlon on Aug. S, pointing out leg'slative measures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living, which contrib utes so largely to this unrest If ilie government's campaign Is to o effec tive. It Is necessary that the other steps suggested should be aef-'d upon at once. Urges Extending Food Control Act I renew and strongly urge the nec essity for the extension of the pres ent food control act as to the period 'it time In which It shall remain In opera tlon. The attorney general hns sub mitted a bill providing for an exten sion of this act for a period of six months. As It now stands it Is limited In operation to the period of the war and becomes Inoperative upon the for mal proclamation of peace. It Is Im perative that It should be extended at onee. The Department or Justice lias built up extensive machlm-iy for the purpose of enforcing Its provisions ; nil of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provi sions of this set are extendej. During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make sltr'lai permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for interstate commerce and to excljd them from Interstate shipment, if the requirements of the law are not com plied with. Some such regulation is Imperative ly necessary. The abuses that have grown up In the manipulation of price by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot other wise be effectively prevented. There can I no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. Civic Associations Can Play Big Part. I As I pointed out In my last message. publicity ran accomplish a great deal in this csmpsign. The alms of the government must be clearly brought to the attention of the consuming public, civic organizations and state officials. who are in a position to tend their as sistance to our efforts. Ton have made available funds with which to carry on this campaign, but there Is no provision In the law au thorizing their expenditure for the pur pose of making the public fully In formed about the efforts of the gov ernment. Specific recommendation has been made by the attorney general in this regard. I would strongly urge up on yoa Its Immediate adoption, as It constitutes one of the preliminary sleps to this campaign. I also renew my recommendation that the Congress pass a law regulat ing cold storage as it 'is regulated, for example, by the laws of the stste of New Jersey, which limit the time dur ing which goods may be kept in stor age, prescribe the method of disposing j of tbem If kept beyond the .permitted i period and require that goods released , from storage shall la all case bear the date of their receipt. Purchaser Would Know of Pre fits. It would materially add to the aerv- iceablllty of the. law for the purpose we now have ia view, if it were also prescribed that all foods released iron. storage for Interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each pack age the selling or market price at which they went Into storage. liy this means the purchaser wold ulwuys lie uble to learn what profits stood be- tween him and the producer or the wholesale dealers. I would also renew my recommenda tion that all goods destined for Inter state commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price ut which they left tile hands oi' the producer. We should formulate n law requiring a federal license of nil corporations en gaged in Interstate commerce und em bodying in the license, or In the condi tions under which It is to he Issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling nnd prevent uncon scionable profits In the method of mar keting. Such a lnw would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much need ed reforms in the business f Inter state shipment and In the methods of corporations which are engaged in it; but for the moment I confine my rec ommendations to the object Immediate ly In bund, which is to lower the cost of living. Capital and Labor Muat Be Partners. No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to bring uliout an Improve ment iu the condition of labor. There can be no settled conditions leading to Increased production, and a reduc tion in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antagonistic Instead of partners. Sound thinking und an honest desire to serve t he Interests of thu whole nation, us distinguished from the Interest of a class, must be applied to tlies nlutlon of this great and press ing problem. The failure of other nations to con sider this matter in a vigorous way has produced bitterness nnd Jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radical ism. Give Workers Rights. Tho remedy for those things must not be negative in character. It must be constructive. It must comprehend the general interest. The real anti dote for the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression tint u deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy. Congress has already shown its willingness to deal with these Indus trial wrongs by establishing the eight-1 hour day us the standard In every! field of labor. It hns sought lo find ti way to prevent child labor. It has j served the whole country by leading the way in developing t lie means of preserving and safeguarding lives und health in dangerous Industries. It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine democratiza tion of Industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to participate Iu some organic way In every decision which directly affects their welfare. It Is with this purpose in mind Hint I called a conference to meet In Wash ington on Dec. 1, to consider these problems in all their broad aspects, with tho Idea of bringing about u bet ter understanding between these two interests. Indorse World League. The great unrest throughout Die world, out of which has emerged a de mand for an Immediate consideration of the difficulties between capital und labor, bids us put our own house In order. Frankly, there can be no per manent und lasting settlements be tween cnpltal and Inbor which do not recognize the fundamental concept for which labor has been struggling through the years. The whole world gave Its recognition and Indorsement to those fundamental purposes in the League of Nations. The statesmen gathered at Ver sailles recognized the fact that world stability could not he had by reverting to Industrial standards and conditions aalnst which the average workman of the world had revolted. It la, there fore, the task of the statesmen of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world conditions and to seek to bring about through legisla tion conditions that will mean the end ing of age-long antagonisms between capital ami labor and that will hope fully lead to the building up of a com radeship which will result not only In greater contentment among the mass of workmen but so bring about a greater production and a greater pros perity to business Itself. Workman's Right to Live Decently. To analyze the particulars in the demands of labor Is to admit the jus tice of their complaint In many mai lers that lie at their basis. The work man demands an adequate wage, suf ficient to permit him to live In com fort, unhampered by the fear of pov erty and want in his old age. He demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary sur roundings, both In home and in work shop, surroundings that develop and do not retard his own health and well lieing and the right to provide for ! his children's wants In the matter of health and education. In other words, it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the live of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear. The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down In the cov enant of the league of Nations offers us the way to Industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. Not to pursue this one Is longer to invite enmities, bitterness snd an tagonisms which In the end only lead to industrial and social disaster. Unwilling Workman Unprofitable. The unwilling workman is not a profitable servant An employe whose industrial life is hedged about by bard and unjust conditions; which he did not create and over which be has no control, lacks that fine spirit of en thusiasm and volunteer effort which are the necessary Ingredients of a great producing entity. Let as be frank about this solemn matter. The evidences of world-wide unrest which manifest themselves in violence throughout the world bid us pause and consider the means to be found io stop the Spread of this contagious thin( before it cap the retry vitality of the nation Itself. Do we gain strength by withholding the remedy T la it not the business of statesmen to treat these uuinif---tatlons of unrest which meet us on every band us evi dences of an Increasing disorder and to apply constructive methods where ever necessury, being sure tliut iu the application of the remedy we touch not the vital Issues of our industrial and economic life? There can be no recession of the tide of unrest until constructive Instrumentalities are set up to stein that tide. Labor Not a Commodity. Governments must recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have nt their base the mutual protection nd wel fare of those engaged In ud indus tries. Labor must not be longer treat ed as a commodity. It must he re garded us the activity ..f human beings, possessed of deep yearnings und desires. I Tile business man gives nis besi thought to the repair and replenish ment of his machinery, so mat its use fulness will not lie impaired and its power to produce may always be at its height and kept in full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to l puld to the human machine, which after all propels the machinery of tiie world and Is the great dynamic force that lies buck of all industry ami progress. Ketiirn to the old standards of wage and Industry in employment Is unthinkable. The terrible tragedy of war w tiler has Just ended and which has liru iglil the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be in vain if there should ensue a return to the condi tions of the past. Europe itself, whence has come the unrest which now holds I lie world at bay, is an ex ample of stand-patlsni In these vital human matters which America might well accept as an example, not to lie followed, but studiously to be avoided. U. S. Should Take Lead. Europe made labor the differential, and the price of it all is enmity and antagonism and prostrated industry. T" right of labor to live In peace and column must ne recognized in- gov ernmeuts und America should be the first to lay the foundation stones upou which industrial peace shall be built Labor not only is entitled to an nd quale wage, but capitm should receive a reasonable return upon lis invest ment and is entitled to protection ut the hands of the government in every emergency. No government worthy of the name can "play" these elements nguinst each other, for there Is u mu tuality of Interest between them which the government must seek to express and to safeguard lit all cost. The right of individuals to strike is Inviolate und ought not to be inter fered with by any process of govern ment, but there Is a pre-eminent rigitt nnd that Is the right of the govern ment to protect all of its people and to assert Its power and majesty against the challenge of any class. The government, when It asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize a class bm simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irrepara ble harm and injury that might la done by the attempt by uny class lo usurp a power that only government Itself has u light to exercise as u pro lection to all. U. S. Must Solve Question Peaceably. In the matter of International dis putes which have led to war, slates men nave sought to set up ns a rem edy arbitration for war. Does this not point the way for the settlement of Industrial disputes by the establish inent of a tribunal, fair and Just ulike to all, which will settle Industrial dis putes which in the past have led to wur and disaster? America, witnessing the evil conse quences which have followed out of such disputes between the contending forces, must not admit itself Impotent to deal with these mutters by means of peaceful processes. Surely, there must be some method of bringing to gether In a council of peace and amity these two great Interests, out of widen will come a happier duy of peace and cooperation, a day that will make for more comfort and happiness iu living and a more tolerable condition amuiig all elapses of men. Certainly human intelligence can de vise some acceptable trihunul for ad justing Hie differences between cap ital and Inlior. Hour of Test for America Is Here. This Is the hour of test and trial for America, lly her prowess und strength, and the Indomitable courage of her soldiers, she demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign battle fields her conception of liberty and Justice. Let not her Influence as a mediator between capital and lalnir be weakened und her own failure to set tle mutters of purely domestic con cern le proclaimed to the world There are those In this country who threaten direct action to force their will Unui a majority. Uussia today, with Its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson of the siwer of minor ities. It makes little difference what minority It is, whether capital or la- I xir, or nuy other class, no sort of '"' "'" if' "" shlp or nothing that is worth while. We are a den-racy, where the ma jority are the masters, or all the biqes and purposes of the men who founded this government have Is-cn defeated and forgotten. U. S. Will Not Stand Any Threats. In America there is hut one way hi which great reforms can lie accom plished and the relief sought by clase- vhtaiiicd, and that is through the or derly irocem-s of representative gov ernment. Those who would pnoe any other method of reform are ene mies of thia country. America will not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness In these dis tressing times. We can afford In the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be self contained and sure. The instrument of all reform In America ia the straight road of Justice to all classes and condi tions of men. Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and revolution. The right road Is the road of Justice and orderly process.
