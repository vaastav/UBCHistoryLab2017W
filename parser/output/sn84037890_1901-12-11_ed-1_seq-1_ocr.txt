11UIKF Mr Roosevelts first message to Con gress was delivered last week It ia quite a lengthy document and would I take almost the whole of THE HERALD to give it in full The rhetoric of the Presidents mes safe Is not better than commonplace I and in every respect it is tame in com parison with the eager expectation of r the public It would have been abstract ly J better and far more appealing to the I people had it been not more than one I third as long as it is The facts and ar guments in it would not have material ly I suffered by such a reduction in space Mr Roosevelt is an earnest energetic President who is expected to overturn policies and overwhelm party ma chinists We believe he will be a Pres ident of action and that many political hearts will be broken before the close of his term bnt his strenuous purposes must be found in his actions rather than in what he has written in his first mes sage to Congress The whole message is as prosy and sermonizing as any doc ument that ever came from the Execu five Mansion but it embraces n great many wholesome truths as well as some rank heresies Taken all in all It is an orthodox Re publican paper though it is on the bor der of egotism in the way in which someI I of the statements of party faith are made There is no indication that Mr Roosevelt will be out of line with his party In tho treatment of the tariff Ho is for reciprocity provided it does not interfere with the protective principle but the indication of a time or state ofI I circumstances that would bring about a collision between reciprocity and pro 1 tection is lacking The message of the President fully bears out the forecasts as to its contents aud general tone After a tribute to the late President McKinley the PrlsI I dent assails anarchy and suggests legisI I lation that will reduce the number of anarchists arriving from foreign shores I and bar those known to be anarchists I On the question of trusts tho President s He suggests that pub licit and Government supervision would remove some of the objections and gives warning against the dangar of I overcapilitatlon At the same time he calls attention to tbe importance of not I disturbing the present prosperity of the country attempting Industrial legis I lation A general revision of the tariff s opposed for the same reason but he urges r clllloct and the abolition of unnecessary duties A new Cabinet ofI I fleer to have charge of commerce IsI I roRomtnended as is tbe readoption of the Chinese exclusion law Legislation in behalf of the upbuilding of the Amer ican merchant marine ii recommended bflt no mention Is made of ship subsidy Amendment of the interstate commerce law ii asked in order that discrimina tion in rates may be prevented AnI I eighthour law for all Government em player is recommended and also reform I in the immigration laws There is aI I strong expression in favor of civil ser vice and the recommendation is made that it apply to the District of Comm bin An increase in tbe navy both in ships and men is urged constant train ing is recommended and the impor tance of keeping the army efficient and of the improvement of the militia andI I naya1 reserve is emphasised On the pubjeot of insular affairs tho President asks a reduction in the tariff duties onII I Cuban imports and suggests the need of legislation concerning public lands InI I Porto Rico He is hopeful of tire FillI I pino becoming capable of selfgovern I meut bnt warns against too much IndoI I pen 1ence The Monroe doctrine is upI I l 1 held in vigorous words and

letter of the alphabet While In the of fire he was asked to repeat some of the Bible which he did accurately He was then asked to explain some passage of Scripture and it must be Raid that his explanations were bordering on the wonderful Brooks says his knowledge of the Bible comes to him through dreams and vision Inspired from God He said Tell all of the preachers to open their doors to this man and let him unfold the hidden deep mysteries of the great books of Daniel and Revelations J W Bryan of Lowder Ill writes My little boy was very low with pneu monia Unknown to the doctor we

IMPORTANT WITNESS The most important witness of the day was Dr Sterling Uuftln an expert an alyist a professor in niateria medica and medical jurisprudence in the Col umbian University who refuted the statement made by Dr Schaeffer the expert for tho prosecution and declared firmly and positively that he had found Dlood stains on both the wrapper and the slippers worn by the accused woman on the night of the murder The wit ness had used the Onlaio method and bad used an advanced system of micro scopy and in all tests had found traces of blood Ho had secured sections of the garments and carefully analyzed all ot them finding blood on all The smears of blood on the curtain of the window and on the window ledge ho stated conformed exactly with the hands and fingers of tine accused womanA and dyeing expert corrob orated the claims of tim witness by stat ing that ho had a girl in his establish ment who had cut her finger and put the blood on velvet and other goods corresponding with tho wrapper worn by Mrs Bonine and ho had managed to clean tine blood off with soap anti water and had left no stain or any clew which any expert might work ou Maurice Bonlue the son of the no cused woman testified that on tho night of the tragedy he and his mother had retired early aud that when he last saw her about midnight she was in her gown and moving about her bedroom after locking the door Tho testimony today was all in favor of the accused woman She appeared delighted with the turn taken by theI I evidence aud was busily engaged all day in couching her lawyers The Best Plaster
