NEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED, Net Repeel or Amendment, but Sup plemental Legislation Needed-The Tobacco Trust Decision an Effective One—Federal Incorporation Recom mended and a Federal Corporation Commi.eion Proposed-Tho Tett of "Reasonableness." To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: This message Is the first of severu which l shun send to congress during the interval between tbe opening ot Its regular session ami its adjourn ment for the Christmas holidays. Ihe amount of Information to bo commu nicated ns to the operations of the government, the number of Important subjects calling for comment by the executive ami the transmission to con gress of exhaustive reports of Special commissions make it impossible to In clude in one message ot a reasonable length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the attention of the national legislature at its ftrst regular session. The Anti-trust Law—The Supreme Court Decisions. In May last the supreme court hnnd ed down decisions in the suits in equi ty brought by the United States to en join tbe further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust nnd of the Ameri can Tobncco trust and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the busi ness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-lrusl act of 1890. The decisions do not de part in nny substantial way from the previous decisions of the court In con struing nnd applying this important statute, but they clarify those dec! sions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to tbe literal con struction of the act. By the decrees they furnish a useful precedent ns to the proper method of dealing with the cnpltal nnd property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest tbe need nnd wisdom of additional or supplemental I legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with tho rule of action and legality tbus finally established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule' of Decision, Merely In Its Form of Expression. The statute in Its first section de clares to bo Illegal "every contract, combination in tbe form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy In restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations" and in the second declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with nny other person to monopolize tiny part of the trade or commerce of tbe several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where tbe statute was Invoked to enjoin a transporta tion rnte agreement between Inter state railroad companies, it was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement ns to rules complained of was reasonable nt common law, be cause it was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and com binations In restraint of trade, whether reasonable at common law or not. It was plnln from tbe record, however, that the contracts complained of In those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable nt common law. In sub sequent cases the court sold that the statute should be given a reasonable construction nnd refused to Include within Its inhibition certain Contrac tual restraints of trade which It de nominated ns incidental or as Indirect. These cases of restrant of- trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were Instances which nt common law would have been call ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil and tobacco cases, therefore, tbe Court merely adopted the tests of tbe com mon law and In defining exceptions te the literal application of the StOtUti only substituted for the test of helnr incidental or indirect that of being rensonnble, nnd this without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words all the enses under the statute which hnve now been decided would ha v< been decided the same way If tin court hnd originally accepted In Its construction the rule nt common law. It hns been said that the court by in traducing into the construction of the statute common law distinctions has emascuiiited It. This is obviously un true. By its judgment every contract nnd combination in restraint of Inter state trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices fjiy stifling competition or of establish Ing in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade is condemned by the stnt nte. The most extreme critics cannot instance a ense that ought to be con demned under the stntute which is not brought within its terms ns thus con strned. Tbe suggestion Is also made that the supreme court by Its decision in the last two cases has committed to tho court tbe undefined nnd unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade Is within tbe terms THE 

LYNDBN TRIBUNE THUMDAT, EVENING, DEC, ' f, 1911 of the statute. This Is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law Is well understood and is clearly defined. It does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of « lawful main contract to which in order that it shall be enforceable at all it must be Incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contract it is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at comman law to contracts or combinations or con spiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, t„ con trol prices or establish monopolies- The courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combina tions or conspiracies might be lawful If the parties to them were only mod erate In the use of the power thai se cured and did not exnct from the pub lic too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that mnny theorists and others engaged In business violating tbe stat ute have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts, bui no court of authority has ever attempted it Certainly there Is nothing in tbe deci sions of the latest two eases from which such a dangerous theory of Ju dicial discretion in enforcing this stat ute enn derive the slightest sanction. Force and Effectiveness of Staftj't* a Matter of Growth. We have been twenty-om- yeatf mak ing this statute effective fur the pur poses for which It was enacted, The Knight case was discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress tbe evils of the trusts. Slowly, tjowev er, the error of thnt Judgment was cor rected, and only In the last three or four years has the heavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutions bave been brought, and a number are pend ing, but juries bave felt averse to con victing for jail sentence- and Judges have been most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectableS standing In society whose offense has been regarded ns merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes: better on derstood and the committing of A par-1 takes more of studied and dellSenite defiance of the law we can be lonti dent that juries will convict Individu als and that jail sentence.-! will s\ iui posed. I The Remedy In Equity by Distortion. In the Standard Oil ense tliesußretne and circuit courts found tho co Ainu - tlon to be a monopoly of the intAtate business of refining, transporting ami marketing petroleum and 1U prflnrts, effected and maintained thrraujßtlilr ty -seven different corporathnA tbe stock of which was beld by ajA/or aey company, It in effect -'oIKnW the dissolution of thtft comjiljMtJii rected the transfer and pro mtfuilri-; button by the New Jersey onwryW the stock held by it in the thirl corporations to and among i««/ek holders, and the corporations Ad indi vidual defendants were enjolmd from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and all agreement; be tween the subsidiary corporations •end ing to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined In the tobneco cuse tho court bund that tbe individual defendants, ttven ty-nine in number, hud been engtßed in a successful effort to acquire torn plete dominion over the manufacture, sale nnd distribution of tobacco la this country nnd nbroad and that this had been dove by combinations made with a purpose and effect to stifle cowpeti tlon, control prices and establish 11 monopoly, not only in the MnttfnctUre of tobneco, but also of tin foil and U c " orice used in its manufacture nnd of its products of cigars, cigarettes ""d snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and diftlcult esse than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the stat ute, There was here no single hold ing compuny, as in the case of the Standard OH trust. The main company was the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling and holding company. The plan adopted if de stroy the combination nnd restore com petition involved tbe rediVision of the capital and plants of the whole l"' s t between some of the companies con stituting the trust nnd new coniP» nlel organized for the purpose* of the d» cree nnd mnde parties to it niui num bering, new nnd old, fourteen. Situation After Readjustment The Americnn Tobneco compft»7 (old), readjusted cnpltnl 186,000,000! the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company (new), capital $07,000,000; the P, LorU lard company (new), capital $4T,000,- --000, and the ft. J. Reynolds Tobacco company (old), cnpltnl |TJ85,000. lire chiefly engaged in the manufaet'ire nnd sale of chewing and tanking t0 " bacco nnd cigars. The former one tin foil company is divided Into two, one of $825,000 cnpltal and the other of $400,000. The one snuff eaapany ls divided into three companies one with a capital of $15,000,000, another with a capital of $8,000,000 and a (bird I,h a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two, one with a capital of $5,758,300 and another with » eapt tal of $2,000,000. There | s al*' the Rrltish-Amerlean Tobacco comity. « British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of eoflooo,ooo. the I'orto Rican Tobacco company, with a capital of $1,800,000 thl ' corporation of United Olirui Stores, with n capital of $u,OOO 000 Under this arrangement 'each of the different kinds of business will be dis tributed between two or molv compa nies with a division of the imminent brands in the same tobacco products, so ns to make competition not only possible, but necessary T bus the smoking tobacco business of (he coun try ls divided so that the"resent to dependent companies have 21.30 per rent, while the American Tobacco com puny will have 33.08 per cent, the Lig gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, tbe Lorll imd company 22.82 per cent and the Reynolds company 2.06 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, bus been taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and has been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them hns been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given voting power which was denied it under the old organisation. The ratio of the pre (erred stock to the common was as 7S to 40. This constitutes a very decided change In tho character of the owner ship and control of each company. In the original suit tbere were twen ty-nine defendants, who were Charged w ith being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired and exercised its unlnwful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will hold amounts of stock in the various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maximum to 2514 per cent ns a minimum, except in the case of one small company, the Porto Mean Tobacco company, in which they will hold 45 per cent. Tho twenty-nine In dividual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying nny stock ex cept from each other, and the group is thus prevented from extending its con trol during that period. All parties to the suit and the new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpet ually from in any way effecting any combination between any of the com panies in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust. Each of tbe fourteen compnnles is en joined from acquiring stock in nny of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common direc to,-- or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to ench other. Bise of New Companies. Objection was mnde by certain in dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large cnpltal in active business and thnt the settle ment that would be effective to put nil on nn equality would be n division of the capital and plant of the trust into small fractions in amount more near ly equal to that of each of the inde pendent companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of tbe anti-trust law and its purpose. It is not Intended thereby to prevent tbe accumulation of large capltul in busi ness enterprises In which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale nnd distribution. It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when its purpose ls that of stifling competition, enhnnc iug.or controlling prices and establish ing a monopoly. If we shall bave by, tho decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided we shall bave nccomplished tho useful purpose of the statute. Confiscation Net the Purpose ef the Statute. It is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property nnd capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by One or imprisonment of tbe Individual offenders, by fine of tbe corporation or by forfeiture of Its goods in transportation are provided, but the proceeding in equity is a spe cific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by Injunction and prevent the future use of tbe plant and capital In violation of tbe statute. Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not In the his tory of Americnn law hns a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court thnn that against the tobacco trust. As Circuit Judge Noyes said in his Judgment approving the decree: "The extent to which it hns been necessary to tear apart this combina tion nnd force It into now forms with the nttendant burdens ought to demon strate that the federal anti-trust statute Is a drastic statute which accomplishes effective results, which so long ns It stands on the statute books must be obeyed and which cannot be disobey ed without Incurring fnrreacblng pen alties. And, on the other band, the successful reconstruction of this or ganization should teach thnt the effect of enforcing this statute Is not to de stroy, but to reconstruct; not to de molish, but to recreate in accordance with the conditions which the congress hus declared shall exist among tbe people of the United States." Common Stock Ownership. It hns been assumed that the pres ent pro rata and common ownership In all these companies by former stock holders of the trust Would Insure n continuance of the snme old single con trol of nil the companies into which the trust hns by decree been dlslnte grated. This ls erroneous and Is based upon the assumed luefllcney nnd Innoo uousness of Judlclnl injunctions. The companies nre enjoined from co-opera tlou or combination; they have differ ent managers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or niuny of the numerous stockholders, reaching Into the thousands, attempt to secure coucerted nctlon of the companies with a view to the control of the market their number is so large tbut such nn attempt could not well be concealed, nnd Its prime movers and all Its partic ipants would be at once subject to con tempt proceedings and imprisonment of n summary character. The immedi ate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the com panies under different managers, and Then competition must follow or there will be activity by_one company, and (Contiuued on Page 7) THE
