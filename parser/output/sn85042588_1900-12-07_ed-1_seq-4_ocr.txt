Congress in the east, as it turned out. was a wise move. The people of That half of the country have had the subject of national irrigation brought liomi' to them in a manner not other­ wise possible. The far-reaching im­ portance of the problem has been pre­ sented to them and a genuine interest lias been awakened. Instead of find­ ing opposition in the east, the congress found that eastern men of prominence •were more than interested in a propo­ sition which promised an increased western population of millions of peo­ ple. As the "enemy's country" has been invaded, the myth of eastern opposi­ tion has faded away and its people are found to lie anxious to see inaugurated a national policy of western arid land reclamation. The western delegates went home with the feeling that they have the liearty support of eastern interests ill securing action which will open to set­ tlement a half a continent, capable of supporting fifty million people. They cannot but feel that this support is growing that it is developing into a great movement that many people are realizing that national action would meet such a western develop­ ment as would increase the national wealth beyond measure. 'i"hi' time seems fully ripe for the wc.t to take a firm and decided stand on the question of national irrigation and something great may be accom­ plished at once. Why not? It is as right that congress should appropriate jnenby for storage reservoirs as for river and harbor improvements. The fcuilding of storage reservoirs would ©bvia te the necessity for much river expenditure and would help naviga­ tion. and the home building area of the United States would be vastly in­ creased. And now if the west makes this demand the east will back it up, for the benefit would not be local. Every western paper is interested in seeing this development accom­ plished. What would be the result of an appropriation of eight or ten million dollars spent annually in the west for irrigation construction? The immediate stimulation would be enor­ mous and the future benefit greater. This policy should be inaugurated and the western press should urge it with one voice. It is a national matter it can be productive only of great good the east is responsible will the west be aggressive it is time to work. It is the opinion at Washington that $40,0ou,two will be appropriated by this congress for river and harbor im­ provements. Of this the western half of tho United States will get, judging by previous records a couple of million or so. Whatever are her possibilities, it is not contended that the west is as Important or influential as the east. She has not yet the dense population but why should she not get at least a fair share of his great appropriation? Why should she not get a fourth of it, to be applied to the building of great storage reservoirs to be filled with flood waters for use in irrigation, un­ der a system of internal improve­ ments? The government is spending large sums in aiding in the development of foreign trade and the opening of for­ eign markets for American manufac tureres. It is believed that we should push our goods into every market of the world and sell them. The belief is also gaining ground that the gov­ ernment should also develop its home market for American products and manufacturers. This it could do by reclaiming the 7.",noo,XH» acres of western arid land and settling them with thousands of industrious home builders. Eastern merchants are more than willing to see such an un­ dertaking. The west should take the initiative. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE BOILED DOWN. Lynchings are again denounced. The passage of a canal bill is urged. An army of 100,0tHi is recommended. The continuation of the policy of reciprocity is urged. Liberal pensions for soldiers and sailors are recommended. Further legislation for Porto Rico a.ml Hawaii is suggested. Need of the definite marking of the Alaskan boundary is urged. The country is congratulated upon tho continuance of prosperity. The fact that Cubans are framing a constitution is pointed out. A decrease of Jj3U,000,1100 in the war revenue taxation is recommended. Tho recommendation for the con­ struction of a transpacific cable is re­ newed. The submission of the question of Chinese indemnity to arbitration is favored. With the exception of the Chinese affair our relations with foreign pow­ ers shown to be friendly. Liberal laws and the greatest meas­ ure of self-government consistent are recommended for the Philippines. The beneficial effect of the financial act of Woo is pointed out and further legislation to "insure the continued parity of gold and silver is recom­ mended. The president says that "American liberty is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period of our in story." The official announcement of the population of North Dakota shows the rapid strides the state has made in population in the past ten years. Some counties, like Williams, Wells and others in which the settlement has been unusually rapid, show in­ creases of several hundred per cent. All of the counties show increases, but the greatset per centage is in the cen­ tral and western part of the state. Burleigh shows an increase to over (i.ooo from -I.L'on in 

IS'JO, an increase of about ."o per cent. Reports of the cities and towns will be made by cen­ sus office bulletin, and this is not yet at hand. Bismarck, it is believed, will show a much greater proportion­ ate increase than the county, the greater portion of the increase in pap­ ulation having been in the city. Some of the cities in the state will complain that the census does not give them credit for the number of people they have, but taking the to till for the state and the counties, it is evident that the work has been done thoroughly and well, and reflects great credit upon the supervisor for North Dakota, Hon. A. 11. Laughlin of Lisbon. Minneapolis hits a sensational mur­ der case. A woman, wine, and two thoughtless and careless young men were concerned. One of the men lies dead, from a murderous blow. The other is in jail, held to answer for the crime. The woman's name is shielded from publication, and there is an at­ tempt from a number of persons con­ cerned to hush the matter up and pre­ vent exposure of unpleasant and sala­ cious details. It is a too frequent chapter of city life. There is a les­ son in it for young men and for young women, but how many will heed it? Idleness and profligacy will continue to breed intemperance, women will continue to be temptresses and men will go on killing themselves and others. Inherited wealth is too fre­ quently a serious handicap to a weak minded man in the race for life's hon­ ors and distinctions. If, as is reported may be done. Gov­ ernor Lind should rise above politics and partisanship and appoint a repub­ lican to succeed Senator Davis, he would earn credit for greater wisdom than he has displayed before. The appointee who will succeed Senator Davis will hold office for a little over a month at best. A republican will be elected to, succeed him and there could be no party advantage in ap­ pointing a democrat for a month. Neither would the honor conferred upon any individual be worthy the making of a. partisan issue of the ap­ pointment. Three names are men­ tioned, should Governor Lind decide to appoint a republican, J. S. Pills bury, W. D. Washburn and Cyrus Northrup. North Dakotans would like to see General Washburn ap­ pointed. The nation will miss Senator Davis. His counsel was wise, 'his intelligence broad, his understanding close and careful. As chairman of the senate committee on foreign affairs, 'he was in position to do much for his coun­ try in the next few years. His re­ election to the senate, had he lived, was certain. His thread of life has been snapped at the time when his honors were "greatest. Some other public man will take up his work where he left it, and the progress of uie nation will continue. But it is to be regretted that his life could not have been spared, that he might have seen the beneficent results of his own wise statesmanship. The northwest mourns him as one of the greatest men it has produced. It could ill afford his loss. The immense orders for new equip­ ment of all kinds which have been placed by railway managers through­ out the country show they have con­ fidence in the continuance of the pros­ perity of recent years, in which the railroads have participated to a large extent. This year has been one of remarkably heavy traffic and the earn­ ings of many roads have been limited only by their facilities for doing bus­ iness. Every manufactory of engines and cars in this country is working overtime to fill orders that have ac­ cumulated. Editor Packard of the Mandan Times observes that the prohibition­ ists who fought part of the republican state ticket, including Major White, with all their little might, are now telling how the republicans cannot go back on their pledges. In view of the brief time of only an hour or two of the call for a meeting of tho citizens of Bismarck to pay trib­ ute to the late Senator Cushman K. Davis and express the community's grief over the loss of so able and patri­ otic a citizen, the gathering at the Grand Pacific was large and composed of representative citizens. The pro­ ceedings appear in another portion of this issue. The congressional reapportionment bill has been introduced in congress. Minnesota gets two additional repre­ sentatives and North Dakota one. None other of the northwestern states are increased. We pause to acknowledge the pres­ ence of the elongated proboscis of Editor Tuttle in the business of the Tribune. He thrust it in last week, with another suggestion as to how the Tribune ought to conduct itself. With this due acknowledgment, we proceed to other things. President McKinley's message is a business document, calling the atten­ tion of the nation's legislators to the work to be done. The indications favor a busy session of congress with some important and needed legislation along conservative business lines, which will go to maintain the degree of prosperity with which the country has been blessed. The counties through the state con­ gratulate themselves on their increase in papulation and all through the state there is pardonable pride at the showing made by the state in the census. Major Murphy and Editor McClure are at it now and the last issue of the Optic has a two column article from tne major on political matters. Mac hasn't had time to reply in the same issue and we are anxiously awaiting the Optic of the coining week. Somebody has been playing it low down on Stiekley of the Wells County News, for he says: "W'hat do you think of a man who will order a paper when he is drunk—or sober, for that matter—take it a while, then tell the postmaster to order it discontinued as he never ordered it?" W. D. Washburn of Minneapolis, in speaking of the sena.torsh.ip, says he is not a candidate for Senator Davis' place and has done nothing to advance his interests. He says the idea of wintering into a political scrimmage for the place is wholly obnoxious to him. Editor Wilder has a kick on the state press association. He says it is too much of a republican club. The fact of the matter is that there are hardly enough fusion papers in the staite to season the state press with even a spice of opposition. Perhaps if Wilder would get into the republi­ can fold—with Tuttle—he'd feel better about it. The Fargo Argus will probably wish it hadn't spoken when the editor reads the following fulsome tribute from the Buford Tribune: "The country press is still kicking the corpse of what was —many years ago—a daily newspaper at Fargo, the Argus. Let up, boys it is nothing but a bundle of putrefac­ tion, and the more you stir it the worse it smells. The Cavalier Chronicle says even if Wipperman and Car mod were de­ feated they were good fellows just the same. It is a peculiar thing about the fusion ticket that Wipperman and Carmody are the only two candidates on it who seemed to be running. The others were merely to fill out, and 

BISMARCK WEEKLY TRIBUNE: FRIDAY:, DEC. 7 1900. were never heard from either before or after the election. Congressman Spalding has been ill at Washington, but was able to be present at the opening of congress. W. Spalding will be active in his work for the interests of the state dur­ ing the session. He will endeavor to get through li.s bill for a public build­ ing at Grand Forks, and will ask for an appropriation to fight smallpox among the Indians in North Dakota. The Mandan Independent nominates A. M. Packard for speaker of the house as the candidate of the anti-prohibi tionists. The editorial vagaries of the Independent will probably not worry Brother Packard any and when he gets into the legislature he will do whait he thinks best for Morton county and the state—regardless of the bees the Independent would put in his bonnet. The Mandan Times says that the members of the volunteer fire depart­ ments of the state will be particularly grateful at the election to tne legisla­ ture of H. L. Reade, of Bismarck, sec­ retary of the state firemen's associa­ tion. Read "has held the office of secretary for several years and largely through his efforts the association has grown and prospered till it takes in nearly every organized department in the state. If there is any legisla­ tion that tho firemen want it will find in Mr. Reade an able and earnest ad­ vocate. GO 

SLOW. THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERS COUNSEL IN THE WAY OF LEGISLATION. The Washington Post has a sympo­ sium of the views of republican sena­ tors on the question of legislation. Nearly all of them urge the wisdom of care and conservatism. The Post says of North Dakota's senator: Senator Hansbrough also preaches conservatism. "The republican party should not, and I believe it will not, do anything of an extravagant nature," he said yesterday. "It has been pretty well demonstrated that our party can be trusted. There will be a number of very important measures which the party will feel obliged to consider and enact into laws. Some legislation with respect to the army must be had. We cannot decrease our forces in the Philippines until the bandits there are cleaned out, until order is restored, and the authority of the United States is acknowledged. The people of this country are not afraid of a standing army, and we are not in danger of im­ perialism. This country has always depended upon its citizen soldiery for defense under extraordinary circum­ stances and extraordinary conditions, and there win be no danger in this re spcet." What are the prospects of the ship­ ping bill?" "The shipping bill will probably oe passed in some form. Whether the bill now before the two houses is the proper one remains to be seen, but the people of this country are in favor of increasing our merchant marines and making it possible for American snips to carry the enormous quantities of our surplus products to foreign lands. "The Republican management," con­ tinued Mr. Hansbrough. "is not going to lose sight of the fact that our great majority came from the agricultural communities of the country. We feel that we owe something to the farmers, because that is where the republican party has always been strong. In this connection I have no doubt that in ad­ dition to increasing shipping facilities to carry our produce across the seas, we will pass the Grout bill so as to en­ courage the domestic dairymen." "How about the canal bill?" "The people of the middle west," was the reply, "are not demanding the passage of the Nicaragua canal bill, although there is a very friendly feel­ ing in favor of the measure. The con­ viction seems to have settled down wpon the country that there should be a canal connecting the two oceans. 1'he question whether our treaty rela­ tions with Great Britain stand in the way of the construction of this canal has given rise to a variety of opin­ ions among leading statesmen who are thoroughly versed in international law, so that the subject is one for dis­ cussion, and one Which, I have no doubt, will be thoroughly discussed at this session of congress. I think, however, that the canal bill will be passed before we adjourn." JURY J-IST.

Grand Forks Herald: Considerable interest is felt in this city in the out­ come of the trial of Percy Baker which will begin to day for the shooting of Nettie Larson, and for this reason it is pertinent to correct some of the rumors that have been published from time to time, that have no foundation in fact. Miss Larson first met Baker when he was running on the G. N. be­ tween Crookston and Fargo before she secured her divorce from her former husband. Baker represented to her at that time that he was a single man, and that she believed for over two years. When she discovered that he had a wife and children she immedi­ ately tried to get rid of him, but he was persistent in his attentions, which grew more and more obnoxious to her, and it was only his threats of violence if she refused to see him that kept their acquaintance alive. It was stated by Baker after the shooting that he did not know why he had shot her, as she had promised to marry him as he requested. This was false, as he shot her because she refused to entertain such a proposal. It has also been stated that Miss Larson sympathized with Baker at this time. This is also wrong. She will not ap­ pear against him because her physi­ cian forbids her to do so. She says she is not particular what becomes of him so that she is rid of him, and that she has not the slightest sympathy for him as he is not deserving of it in any way. If he is set free she is afraid of further violence and for this reason site either wants him to receive a penitentiary sentence or to leave the country, she don't care which. This information comes from a reliable source. TO HANSBROUGH'S TRIBUTE DAVIS. The "death of Senator Davis involves a great loss to the senate and to the country, especially at this time, when so many important questions relative to our foreign relations are pending. Senator Davis was a recognized au­ thority on international law, and many of us looked to him for informa­ tion and guidance on this subject. His opinions were always sound, and there­ fore they were valuable. We of the northwestern states felt an especial pride in him, and to us his untimely death is little less than a disaster. We do not forget his efforts in our behalf when we were struggling for statehood. No man knew better than he of the ab­ solute justice of our cause, and none advocated it with better effect or greater earnestness. It is to be re­ gretted that, ne could not live to see the success of our policy of expansion, for he was among the strongest advo­ cates of it. In his late speeches and writings will be found all the argu­ ments there is on the subject He had studied the oriental problem, as he studied all great problems, beginning at the beginning and pursuing the sub­ ject to its logical conclusion and but for his death the country, at the com­ ing session of congress, would have been favored by him with a disquisi­ tion on the subject that would have taken prominence as a classic in state­ craft literature." A NOTED CHARACTER. Cavalier county shelters a man on whose head the Canadian government at one time placed si reward of $10^, 000. He is Gabriel Dumont, one of the ringleaders of the last Reil rebel­ lion, in ISS.j. Dumont is said to have been possessed of far more talent than Reil as a strategist, and to have pos­ sessed the confidence of the Canadian half-breeds to a groat extent. Du­ mont, with a handful of breeds, worked his way through the Canadian lines and escaped into Montana. He is at present living in the vicinity of Olga, an inland town situated in the Pem­ bina mountains, where he makes his home with the breeds, all of whom look upon him as a real Moses. Du­ mont has visited Winnepeg once since the rebellion, but he returned without having been identified. He goes armed continually, expecting that an attempt will be made on his life by friends of some of the Canadian militia killed in the rebellion. Nothing has been heard of the reward in lat^years. The Canadian government is satisfied that Dumont does not care to.take up his residence on the Canadian side of the border and that is sufficient. A 

CURIOSITY. Lisbon Gazette: A tree curiosity was recently discovered by M. E. Dye on the Gates farm, six'nines southeast of Lisbon on the banks of the Shey enne where the river makes a sharp bend. The tree was an elm about twenty-four inches in diameter and was cut down by Dye for wood. In splitting one of the sections Mr. Dye discovered near the heart of the tree a distinct blaze made by an axe, and a few inches below are two smaller cuts, all as plainly defined as if made but The Oldest and Best 8.

By the rings on the tree outside of these cuts it is evident mat the latter were made at least 70 years ago, when the tree was only about eight inches in diameter. It had required a growth of some twenty years to entirely cover the scar of the larger cut, after which there was a growth of-some twelve inches in diam­ eter, of solid wood. It is thought that this tree was blazed by trappers of the Hudson Bay Co., some seventy years ago, the evidence of which has been locked in the solid wood of the tree for half a century or more. The section of the tree containing these ancient axe scars is on exhibition at Uncle Dan Marsh's store. TELEPHONE SYSTEM. The Northern Pacific Railway has decided' to substitute the telephone for the present telegraph system of the road and will build and equip Iong distance telephone lines to take the place of the telegraph wherever it is deemed practicable. The officials of the road believe that most of the telegraphing that is now done in connection with the business of the traffic department can be as well, if not better, performed by tele­ phone. The plan is to place each sta­ tion on a division in direct communi­ cation with the divison headquarters and the various division headquarters are to be connected with the general offices with long distance lines. In this way much necessary information of importance to the traffic and oper­ ating departments which, on account of the limitations of the telegraph system, must now be sent by mail, can in the future be telephoned at once. The advantage of this system is ob­ vious. Telephones are now used quite extensively and with marked success on many of the eastern roads. The Northern Pacific, however, is the first of the western roads to adopt this system. NFW
