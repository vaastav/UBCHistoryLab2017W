BOSTON. BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 3. In Maaa-enosetts, the suuimary ditsclu tio of the John Brown meoting it Tre mont Temple to-day, is viewed wiUi general tatiafucuoQ. Toe Abolitionists were large ly out-vo'ed throughout by an assemblage' embracing many leading business men. After the Chairman had pronounced the meeting dissolved, Fred. Douglas, Sanborn, and a few others manifested some resist ance to the police, and were ejected from the platform and b&lL. During the uproar, ReT. J. Stelli Martin announeed that a meeting would be held in his church in the evening. In response to this announcement, the Baptist Church (colored) on Jay street, wag filled at an early hoar. The edifice was small, and a Urge proportion of the audience were black. Here Wendell Phillips, John Brown, Jr., Fred.Dortglas and otherleading John Brown sympathizers, ventilated their opinions freely, with little interrup'ion. A woman named Chapman appeareo to preside. Sev eral policemen were stationed in the church. Outside there was an immense crowd and strong force of police. The disturbance was confined to noisy demonstrations, though the crowd seemed very anxious te get hold of Kedpath. The meeting broke up about 10 o'clock, and the audience dis persed quietly. Some of the leading spirits were hooted at While passing through the outside crowd, but no violence was cemro it ted. Frank B. Sanborn was aoting Presi dent or tne meeting. In anticipation of a riot, the second bat- tallionof infantly was held in readiness at their armory, by order of the Mayor. The police force, however, was amply sufficient, and the da and evening passed with a gxd natured bnt quite patriotio excite ment.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. After alluding to the great ootnmercial. agri cultural and fiber material protperitit of the country, the l'reaideuu alu why it la then, that dwoontant now ao exteiuively prevails, and tiia uuiou of the btatea which hi the tourae of all theaa hl iug la threatened with d etraction, llie loug ouutiBued and ititemiwrata interference of the uorturen people with the question of slavery iu the Southern Mates, haa at U-uKth produced ita natural fttecu. The dincreut etauof the Union are now arrayed aguiu.l each other, aud the time has arrived, ao much dreaded by the lathers ol the country, when hostile geographical partie hare been formed. 1 hi. doe not proceed Milrly from the claim on the part ot .'or.grwts or tin ter ritorial legislatures to exclude slavery 1'rem the territories, nor lroul the edurt of the dltlerent Mate the execution ol the ui:!tive blare Law, but the immediate peril ari trom IneeMant and violent egttatiouo! theslavcrv question through out uie North tor the last quarter of a century, has produced iu malign lncueuce on the slaves, and iwpires them with vague notions of freedom, hience a sense ot security no louder exists aroaud the xiuuily altar. This fveiiug of peace at hoiua has giveu place to appreheuRluns ol servile inur reciious. Many a matron throughout the boutb retires at niffht in dread of what may befall her self and children before the morning. Should his apprehension of domesl 10 dnuirer exist and intenvify iuteelf until It shall pervade the mantes of Southern people, then disunion will become in ev liable, belt preservation is the first law of na ture, and no political uuion however fraught with blessings and beuenut in all otlier reepeota, can longer conliuue, aud tha neceesary ooaiejuence be to render tha homes and nreeidea of nearly half of the parties to U are habitnally and hope lessly insecure, aeenre. booner or later the bonds of such a Union must be aevered. It la my con viction that this fatal period has not yet arrived. After reierriug to the incessant agitation against slavery at the North for the last twenty. live years, both by preea and the people, and asserting that Congress at occupied with violent speeches on this neverending subject, he Veinarka how easy it would b lor the American peo pie to settle this slavery queetiou, aud restore peace and harmony to tins distracted country, which can be done by letting them alone aud permitting them to manage their own State af fairs, as tuey only only are responsible before God for slavery existing among them, and with which the North has no more right to Interfere than with tha similar institulioiie in Russia or brazil, aud the President still relies on the good sense and forbearance of tbe people, alleging it is out of the power of any President to accom plish. But little which leads him to observe that the election of any oue -of our fellow-citizens to til omce of President docs not of itself allbrd Just cause tor dissolving tbe Union. The late election having been held in strict conformity with the provisions of the Constitu tion, does not Justify a resolution to destroy this very Constitution. Reason, justice, and a regard for the Constitution, all reouire that we shall wait for some overt and dangarous act on the part ot the President elect, belore resorting to such a remedy. Mr Buchanan refers to the fact that the Presi dent's province is not to make but to execute the laws. It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession, that the bouthern States are denied equal rights with the other States iu the common territory. But by what euthfrity are these de nied? Not by Congress; which baa never passed, and I believe never will pass any act to exclude slavery from these territoriea, and certainly not by the Supreme Court, which has solemnly de cided that slaves are property, and. like all other property, their owners have a rifht to take them tuto the common territories and hold them there under the protection of the Constitution. Tlte anticipation that Congress may pass some law obnoxious is no good reason for dissolution. Tbe President re-asserts the power of Congress over property in the Territories, and the sacred rights of property are secured by the Constitu tion. The most palpable violations of coostitu it i:.tial duty which hss yet been committed, con sist in the acta of different State Legislatures to defeat tha execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. It ought to be remembered, however, that for these acts neither CoDgreaj or any President can justly be held responsible. Having been passed in violation of the Federal Constitution, they are. therefore, null and void. It will be the duty of tbe next President, as it has been my own, to act with vigor iu executing the Fugitive Slave Law against conflicting enactments of State Leg islatures. We are not to presume in advauce that be will violate his duty, which would be at war with every principle of justice. Let ns wait for the overt act. The Fugitive Slave law has been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement of the present Ad ministration. Let us trust that the State Legis latures will repeal their unconstitutional and ob noxious enactments. Unless this shall be done without unnecessary delay, it is impossible for any human power to save the Union, and the Southern States have a right to demand this act of justice from tbe Northern States. Should this be refused, tbe injured State, after having first used all peaceful means to obtain redress, would be justihed in revolutionary resis tance to the Government of tbe Union. The al leged principle that as each Stale became a party to the Union, by tbe vote of its own people, as sembled in convention, so any one of them may retire from the Union in a similar manner, by tbe vote of such a constitution, is wholly incon sistent with tha history as well as the character of tbe Federal Constitution. He then rehearses a portion of Gen. Jackson's message of 1333, relative to the nullifying ordi nance of South Carolina, and says this Govern ment was intended by its founders to be perpetual and not to be annulled at tlte pleasure ol ay oue of the contracting parties. Tbe President then enumerates the powers con ferred on Congress by the Federal Government, and that these powers may be effectual, it also preserves exclusive right to lay and collect all import duties and other taxes, and has adapted effectual mean to restrain the States from inter fering. But the distinction must ever be observed that this is a revolution against an estab lished government and not a voluntary se cession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In short, let ns look the danger fairly in the face. Secession is neither more nor less than revolution. It may or it may not be a justifiable revolu tion, but still it is a revolution. What, in the mean time, is the responsibility! and trae position of the Executive? He is bound to take care that the laws are faith fully executed, and from this obligation he cannot be absolved by any human power. But what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part has been rendered imprac ticable by events over which he could have exercised ao control T Such at the present moment is the case throughout the State of South Carolina, so far as the laws of the United States to secure the administration of justice by means of the Federal judi ciary are concerned. All tbe Federa loffi- oers within its limits, through whose agency alone these laws can be car ried 'into execution, have already re signed. We no longer have a District Judge, Distrust Attorney or a Marshal in oouLh Carolina. In fact, the whole ma chinery of the federal government necessa ry for the distribution of remedial Justice among the people has been demolished, and wonld be difficult, if not impossible, to replace it. The only acts or Congress on the statute book bearing on this subject are those or the win or February, 17U5, and 8d or March, IcHlZ. These authorize the Free dent, after he shall ' have ascertained that the Marshal with his posse comitatus unable te execute civil or criminal pro cess in any particular ease, to call forth the military and employ the army and navy to aid mm in performing this service, having first by proclamation commanded the in surgents to disperse and retire peacably their respective abodes within a limited time. This duty cannot by any possibility performed in a State where no Judicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no Marshal to execute it, and where even if there were such an officer, the en tire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present can or can not be amended so as to carry out iiore effectually the objects of the vansiuution. - - The revenue still continues to be collected heretofer at the custom house at Charleston, and should the collector unfor. tunately resign, a eolleotor may be appoint w puiiuriu una amy. . it is not believed any attempt will be made to expel the . , o,. r i . . - umiu ovBten irom us pioperty there by force, but if in this I should prove to be mistakes, the officers in command of the forts have receive! orders to act atriotly the defensive. Ia such a eoatingency responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the as sailants. In reference to recognising a seceding State as an Independent Govern ment, by (he President, he says it would a naked a et of usurpation on his part it is his duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its bearings. Tbe probability of an emergency scon arising when Congress will be called on to decide question whether it possesses power to compel a Stat to remain in the Union, authorizes him to exrree the opinion that I such power has been delegated to Con- gra, or ,U an oiier depuhae&t of ti the a J in to - the of i to, elect ad come 'J of would had th cTh Re and sion dock, and Federal Government. It is manifest that this Is not among tbe specifio and enumer ated powers granted to Congress, and It is equally apparent that Its exercise is not neooessary and proper for carrying into execution any one of these powers. Th President declares that to make war upon a State Is at varlanoe with the spirit of tbs Constitution, and after having con quered a State how are we to govern it? We oould not govern it by despotlo power nor eould we by physical foroe oompel ita people toelect Senators and Representatives and perform ail the duties appertaining to an independent State. The fact Is that our Union rests upon publio opinion and oan never be cemented by the blood of its citi sens shed In civil war. It it cannot live in the affections of-the people it must one dsy perish. Congress possesses many means of preserving it by ooooiilation, but the sword is not placed in their hands to preserve it by foroe. But may I be permitted solemn ly to invoke my ooontrymen to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this, the grandest temple whioh has ever been dedicated to human freedom sinoe the world began. It has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of the past, by tbs hopes of the future I The Union has already made us the most prosperous, and - ere long will, If, preserved, render us the most powerful nation on tha face of the earth ' In ev ery region of the globe, thetttle of American cit izen is held In the hiffhest respect, aud when pro- bounced in a foreign land, it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell wltn honest priae.- sure ly .when we reach tbe brink of the yawing abyss, we should recoil with horror from the fatal plunge. By such a dread calastrophy the bojtes of the friends ot freedom throughout the world, would be destroyed, and a long night of despot ism would enshroud the nation. Our example for more than eighty years would not only be lost, but would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unlit for sell government. The slavery question like everything will have its day. 1 ttrmiy believe that it has already reach ed and passed the culminating point, but if In th midst of the existing excitement tha Union shall perish, the soil may then become insupera ble Congress oan do much to avert it by propo sing and recommending to the legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils which the Constitution haa itself provided for its own preservation. The President proposes that his explanation amendment to tne Constitution be adopted by Congress for the final settlement of the true con struction of the Constitution on three special points. An express recognition of the right of firoperty in slaves in the States where it now ex sts, or may hereafter exist The duty f protec ting this right in all tba common territories tliro -out their territorial existence and until they snail be admitted as States inte the Uion, with or without slavery as IhelrCoustilutlonsmay pro scribe. A iike lecognition ot tiia right of the master to have his slave who haa escaped from one State to another, restored anal delivered up to him. and of the validity of tha F'ugitive biave Law, enacted for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State laws Impairing or de feating this right, are Violations of the Constitu tion, aud are consequently null and void. Such an explanatory amendment would, it is believed, forever terminate the existing disten tions, and restore peace and harmony among the States. The President then discusses our foreign rela tions. Our relations with Spain have been com pticated by tbe refusal of the Senate to ratify the Convention for the adjustment of the Cuban claim, so called. He reiterates his recommenda tion for the acquisition of Cuba by a lair pur chase. With the exception of .Vexico our relations are generally of a satisfactory character In relation to Kansas, he says the desperate band recently assembled under a notorious out law in tha southern portion of the Territory to resist tbe execution of the laws, aud to plunder the peaceable citizens will. I doubt, not be speed ily subdued and brought to justice. He recommends a Pacitic Railroad: congratu lates the country upon the apparent and diminu tion of the slave trade, and the extinction ol the filibustering excitement; and in view of the destitution in Kausas, recommends to Congress that if any constitutional measure of relief can be devised the subject should be duly considered. 

CONGRESSIONAL. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. HOUSE. After the Message, Sherman moved that tha Message he referred to the Committee of the Whole. The printing of 20,000 copies of course, he referred to the Commit tee on Printing. Mr. Boteler offered an amendment that so much of the Message as related to t he pecul iar condition of the country be referred to a special committee of one from each State, to report at any time. Mr. MoClelland offered an amendment that so much of the Message as related to grievances between the slave holding States and the proposal by Congress of amend ments to the Constitution, for ratification by the several States, and the question of State secession, be referred to a committee of one from each State, to be appointed by the Speaker, such committee to report by bi Us or amendment to the Constitution upon such subjects particularly whether legisla tion or amendment to the Constitution ia necessary to give prompt, full and certain effect to the artiele in the Constitution con cerning fugitives. Mr. Boteler declined to accept McCler nand's amendment. Mr. Sherman proposed to Mr. Boteler that the committee be fifteen instead of one from each State. Cries of "oh no." Mr. Bocock raised a point of order in reference to Mr. Boteler s amendment, that he committee could not report at any time without the suspension of the rules. Tbe Speaker decided in favor of Mr. Bo cock, but the latter withdrew his objection, and Messrs. Curry and Burnett renewed it. Mr. Morris, of Illinois, offered an amend ment read lor information, that we are unalterably attached to the Union, re oogniie in the Union the primary cause of our present greatness and pros perity, and as yet have seen nothing either in the election of Lincoln or other sources to justify dissolution, and pledge our lives and saered honor to maintain it. Objected tO. After some suggestions the question was taken en Boteler s resolution as an amend ment. . Singleton of Mies., declined voting, his State having called a Convention to con sider the matter. -, - Jones of Georgia, declined voting, for similar reasons, also Hawkins of Louisiana. Mr. Morris of Illinois, raised a point that while the question was pending it was out of order to open the debate. Mr. Clopton of Alabama, and Gartrell of Georgia, refused to vote. Mr. Curry, of Ala,, attempted to address the House but was voted ont of order. Mr. Moore, cf Ala., declined to vote. Mr. Miles, of S. C, said his State was out the Union, except by a mere form, there fore her delegation took no interest in this question. His remarks were received with good humor. Mr. Pugh, of Ala- declined to vote. Mr. Boteler' s resolution was adopted. eas io, nays tss. The House agreed to Mr. Sherman's mo tion with Mr. Bottler's amendment thereto Mr. Boteler declined serving on the com mittee. Mr. Morris, of Illinois, endeavored to introduce bis resolution, but it was objected ana tne no use adjourned. 

SENATE. After the reading of the message Mr. CUngman moved to have it published. Re thonght it fell short of investigating the crista. Tha President elect is known totes dangerous man, and his paity would eventually control the Government, the Pn- Ereme court inauuwi. llednl not think the States ad acted precipitately, aud iu his judgment a num- ww ina caies wouia aecaue in sixty days, la Bouth Carolina the submission nartv was small. Th- wisest thiug Congress can do is to divide tbe public piuirtj mm rir as pusaioie alter paying tne Bunuc dehis. Mr. Crittenden replied, hoping th example of the gentleman would not be followed. ttr n-.-r come ore ax an. h i'nion was worthy of great sacrifices and f on cessions. He looked forward to disunion with fear, dismay and trembling. Tbef must search for means reconciliation and harmony. Ua hoped there would be no angry debate.
