DECEMBER 17, 1863 Wo Know tfo Party, but the Party of the Constitutoii. Thk abu.se of words is often the source of frightful evils. The way in which the word slavery has been commonly applied among us affords a flagrant instance, both of such an abuse, and of it* results, which, in this case, are of the most pernicious character. The manner in which the mis chief has been done is very simple. A harrowing tain of cruelty is told, and that is called slavery. It is decked with all the embellishments of rhetoric, and recited with t be declamation of a Bekchkr or a Phil lips; and that is called a discussion of slav ery. While in truth, it is as though one should undertake to discourse upon mar riage, and should speak only how the wo man thereby subjects herself to the power of man, losses her freedom, and among the consequences, suffers whippings and other cruelties, is sometimes oven murdered: and all this should bo offered as showing the the real nature of marriage. The analogy is not new. The original abolitionists recognized it. and railed against the marital obligation* as a species of slavery that ought to be abolished. So inveterate has the use of words be come, ;n the case of slavery, that if any one proposes to take a broader view, he is at once sneered at and derided, as the apolo gist or defender of slavery. It is assumed that such partial exhibitions of the sub ject are the whole truth, and that whoever is not converted bv them justifies the enormities imputed to it. and wants even the humanity that would condemn them. ? The pains that are thus taken to prevent any more enlarged inquiries might well lead to the suspicion that very full comi dwnce is uot ?ntertaiued in the justice of the conclusions to which these gross abuses of the word slavery has led. The word and the ideas thus as sociated with if. have become the symbols of political power. They govern the coun try with an absolute sway. They are re presented bv the present Administration, and sustained by them ; our present rulers are allowed to sap the foundations the public liberty, and to . iolate all the safe guards that have been thrown arounl poli tical and individual freedom. They have been, to an alarming extent, substituted for religion ? for Christianity itself. To such an extent is this true, that a poison *aid to be reputed a Sound Orthodox minis ter, addressed a letter to the late Garrison abolition meeting in Philadelphia, saving, that, though agreeing with them in sonti meut since 18?J1, ho had never acted with them, yet exhorting them not to give up tbeir orgina/atton, as had been proposed^ but to keep it up, as a substitute tor the Church, as being at this time more efficient and more pure. Just views of the definition of tho word Slavery, as applied to the relation between master and servant at the South, would do much to remove the present national cala mities. The interest of party, the infatu ation of fanaticism, and the clamors ot ig no ranee, all labor and tend to keep up the delusion. Hut, sooner or later, the truth must prevail. At some time, the inexora hie logic of events will force upon the pub lic- mind the conviction that there are great er miseries than any which slavery brings; and that it has been alike foolish aud wick ed to incur them in the vain hope, by its abolition, of lessening the i mount of exist ing evil. The above remarks were suggested by reading an editorial in a morning cotempo rary on the election of a Chaplain for the Lower House of Congress, wherein Bish op Hopkins's views <>n Slavery were "rung' upon. Thk Lead of the new statue of freedom placed over the Capitol, at Washington, is bronze. There is a discussion going on be tween the ultra newspapers of the two ex tremes, which it is, a ';mulattoM or a ' Cop. perhcad.1' - m - A correspondent of the New York WorUi telegraphs from the front of the Army of the Potomac that the army has not gene into wiuter quarters, and probably will not do so where it is. ? ? M It is stated that, tor the first time since the presidency of General Jackson, the ad ministration has been able to organize in its interest the Congress elected for the last two rears of its term. B ills will soon be introduced into Con gress to bring Nebraska, I" tab. and Colora do Territories into the Union as States. ihtiit nun the linn. 

PROCEEDINGS IN THEIR CONGRESS. JEFF. DAVIS FIERCELY DENOUNCED. 1 ! Report of the Secretary of the Rebel Treasury. The Amnesty Proclamation The Amnesty Proclamation In tended to Make Capital for us in Enrope. From the Richmond Sentinel, Dec. II. We learn that President Lincoln, in his Message, proposes that the States of our' Cunfedercy shall take a vote outhe question of returning to political union with the States of the North. We have not been able to see the Message ourselves, and do not know the terms on which it is proposed to receive us. We do not know whether Lincoln proposes to suspend the war while wo are to consider the question, so as to enable us to do so without intimidetion. ? Wo do not know whether tho proposed de cisions to which the States inay arrive, are to be acquisced in ,and finally, whatever the decison may he, or whether they are only to havo virtue, if given in a particular way. The right to decide involves the right to choose; but, perhaps, Lincoln may not see it so. We suspect that the invitation is intended to blind his own people, and make capital in Kurope, while to us, it is but tho old song "Will you walk: into my parlor," said tbe ?pider to tbe fly. " Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy. The wav into my parlor is up a wiuding stair, And I have many pretty things to show you when you are there/' '?Oh! no, no!" said tho little fly; "to ask me iain vain. For who goes up your winding Rtair, shall never come dowu again." Stale of the Rebel Treasury.

SENATE. Nothing of special importance has beon transacted. * HOUSE. THI-MOVTHLY CONCRE1SE3 DURING THE WAR. Mr. Johnson offered the following, which was referred:? Resolved , That during the progress of the present war between the Confederate and United State* of America, a nd after the passage of the aot, no vacation or adjourn ment of Congress for a longer period than thraa months shall take place; but that Congress shall meet on the first Monday after ninetj days from the end of each seasion, unless sooner called together by j the President. /HE 

REBEL DISASTER AT CHATTANOOGA?; JEFF. DAVIS DENOUNCED. Mr. Foote offered a resolution instructing the Military Committee to inquire int^ the causes of tha late disaster near Chatta- ! nooga, and ascertain and report whether it wa? owing to a want of valor in tho troops, as stated in the President's message, or i to other causos. lie would undertake to say that tho ' President himself was responsible for that defeat, and he was prepared to prove it; and furthermore, he would show that he had endeavored to skulk the responsibility and throw it upon tho brave men who hadbared their breasts to the battle. No man should denounce those men as wanting in valor with impunity, it was an accusation dis honorable to the honor and discreditable to all, which would tend to the demoralization of our troops, and may be productive of still worse disasters. It had been urged upon the President to remove from the command ot that army General Bragg, who had already proved himself incompetent for his position. The President was called upon to remove him as incompetent and even dangerous. ? But the result is known. Bragg was not removed. That man (Bragg) has been most odious to both the army and people for more than a year, and the President must have known it. But he visited the I army aud said there was no cause for com plaints. But I found the whole army was distrustful of him. One thing is certain, he has driven away every one of his hest gen erals. He has driven away the skilled and gallant Polk; he has force 1 tbo noble heart ed Bucknor to leave him; he has calumiU? ated Breckinridge, and victimized M'Cowu. Everybody know* h?< is on bad terms with Hardee. Ifo > c istituted that he can not agree with any of his commanders. ? What is more, one of my colleagues has re ceived a letter from Bragg himself, in which he said ? only live weeks ago ? that he i couldn't commaad that army effectively un less he was clear of ? unless there weie cash iered ? 12 brigadier generals, and a whole regiment of field officer#. President d^avii was app'aled to by* fiearly every officer for his removal. But he stood up for Bragg: he had committed himself to the countrv; he had expressed his opiuion, publicly of BraggJs litness for tho command, and was determined to risk the safety of the coun try upon it. For the same reason and un der the same ci-cumstances Pemberton was retained. That was the sole reason of the fall of Vicksburg. To show the pertinacity of the President, the military court direct ed to inquire into the conduct of Pember ton, was dispensed with in two days after it met, by the order of the President. When this man had surrendered ? dishonorably surrendered ? his command to the enemv, the President made him his companion, car ried him with him toBragg's army, and if the truth must be told, many a soldier xaid, as they rode along tho linea, "there goes the traitor who delivered us over at Vicks burg.'' Even then the President hud the unblushing disregard of public sentiment to offer to that same Pemberton the com mand cf Polk's corps; and if ho had under taken that duty ho would have been slain in the earliest hour of battlo by the hands of his own men. What now does the Preii dent say? Does he come forward boldly and say, M am responsible for the disaster-" No. He charges them with want of valor. 1 charge him, not with want of valor, but with want of confidence in the opinions of others; with gross mismanagement; with contempt for the sentiment of the people. The President nevor visited the army with out doing it injury ? never yet, that it has not been followed by disaster. Would to God he may never visit the armv again; would to God he had yielded to tho public sentiment of the country; would n God he had heen able to appreciate the truth that when confidence is once lost bv the people in an officer it is suicidal to retain him. 

FINDING AND ISSUE OF TREASURY NOTES. j Mr. Orr offerred the following That the committeof Finance beinstruc ! ted to inquire whether the construction given by the Secretary of the Treasury- to the act supplementary to an act to provide for tho funding and further issue of Treas ury notes, is authorized bv said act. He said the government purchased cot- i ton in the moruiug at forty cents, aud sold the same in the evening at twelve and-a half cents, as was shown by the action of the Secretary of the Treasury, and he read the published advertisement of that officer i as proof of this assertion. He regarded the construction placed on the act of Congress iu regard to this matter by tho Secretary of the Treasury as wroug, and was confi i dent that it would eventually prove ruinous l to the country. I REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY TO BE TAXED ACCORDING TO VALUE. On motion of Mr. Boyce, of S. C., that part of Davis* message relating to finance' and the report of the Secretary of the Treasury was referred to acommi'tte com posed of one member from each State. Ti/? committee thus appointed will be in utrucjted to report a bill for layi ng and col lecting"! tax upon rea* and personal proper ty. according to value. MiSSISSIPPIANS WILL NOT CROSS THE RIVER TO FIG HT IN THB REBEL RANKS. Mr. Johnston, of Ark., offered a bill rela ting '-to the transfer of skeleton regiments for recruitment across the Mississippi river, and the transfer of companies to the regi mentaof their own States, and to consoli-! datioe mid disbandment." He said: ? Men from tfa^B other side of theMissiasippij^ould not coue* on this side for the purpcfe of joining the army to fight here. He was glad of it, and hoped another man would not croes the Mississippi, so long a? the gov ernment adhered to its present unjust poli c y in regard tu hi* fee t ion . fft ifn1 the bill be referred to the Committee on Military Affairs, which was agreed to.ai The treatment of Union prisoners in reb . el prisons was by resolution brought before : the House. Its reference to a committee was negatived. The question of arbitrary impressments was referred to the Military committee. Ho?L Fernando H ood's Peace JJ Resolution*. 4 ,.?he Vote by which they are Tabled On Monday, Hon. Fernando Wood, of New York, offered the following Preamble and Resolutftrtv in the Lower House of Con gress, whieh were tabled by the following vote: > Whereas, The President in his message delivered to this llouse on the 9th iu*t., and in his recommendation to the people to assemble at their places of worship to give thanks to God for recent victories, claims that the Union cau?e has gained important and substantial advantage, and Whereas, In view of these triumphs, it is no longer beneath our dignity nor dau? gernits'to mr safety to evince a generous magnanimity becoming a great and power ful people by offering to the insurgents an opportunity to return to the Union without imposiug upon tliem degrading ui destruct ive conditions; therefore, Resolved, Thai the Presideut request ed to appoint three Commissioners who shall be empowered to open negotiations with the authorities at Richmond, to the end that this bloody, destructive, and inhuman war shall cease, and tbe Union be restored upon terms ot equity, fraternity and equal ity. under the Constitution.

The Washington Republican and other newspapers edited by friends of General Hooker have taken advantage of the publi catiou of General Halleck's otik ial report to claim that the battle of Gettysburg was in point ot' fact won by Hooker, that is, that General Meade merely carried out tbe plans of his predecessor. This is dearly absurd. W hen Hooker gave up the command ! it was not known by either general when i>r where the battle would be fought. It was finally brought on almost arcidentiy. ? ' General Meade was pressing in the direction 1 of Carlisle [Pa ] to form a junction with the ' militia under Ceneral Couch, while General Lee was aiming for both Baltimore and Wa?Uingtou. The rival armies came into eollisionat Gettysburg, where neither wish ed to tight. m Gf.n. Butler and Mr. Ocld. ? A cor res- , pondcnce has just taken place between Gen. Butler and Mr. Ould. the confederate com missioner for exchange of prisoners, It ap pears that smallpox has broken out among the Union prisoners at Belie Isle, and that Gen, Butler has forwarded a quantity of vaccine matter suffcient to vaccinate six -| thousand persons, which has be?n received and acknowledged by Mr. Ould. who says: "Permit me, in response to the friendly tone of your letter, to assure yon that it i? mv most auxious desire, and will be my con stant effort to do everything in my power to alleviate the miseries that spnag out of this i horrible war. ? ? ? - < In regard to the alleged starvation of Federal prisoueis by the Rebels, Jkff. - Davis, in his Message, 6ays : '?In accordance with our law," and the general ord^rt of tbe department, the ra tions of the prisoner* are precisely the same, I in quantity and in quality, as those served ? out to onr own gallant soldiers in tbe tield, and which hdve been found sufficient to support them in their ardnons campaigns, while it i* not pretended by tbe enemy that thev treat prisoners by the same generous rule.
