HALL OP FAME SELECTIONS. This is an extremely good list. Until the additional twenty-one names are Selected it will be entirely safe to criti- else the manner of selection. Whether or not, the list of twenty-nine already made, or the list of one-hundred and fifty that our descendants will have the J Opportunity of criticising, shall prove acceptable in every particular, several things are evident; first, that no possi ble list will suit every one; second, that !no possible list can be scientifically and Unquestionably correct; third, that the preparation and presentation of the list are very decidedly aducational. The judges themselves must have especially realized how much ignorance there was afloat in their own minds concerning 1 the specific services of many of the diS' tinguished men and women whose names they were asked to review; and If they probRbly had to do some cram Jtnfng for the occasion, what about the etate of knowledge of ordinary mor tals? It would seem that the tendency will be rather to mistakes of exclusion thanof inclusion, and that every name . Krtll "repFe'stmt a distinguished reputa iion and a career well wirth the con Bideration of ingenuous youth. The .Very existence of this beadroll of fame 'will pique curiosity and interest, and bo the occasion of truly educational arguments, in the university and out, tor all time. And this leads to the suggestion of a query whether or not there might be a .way of getting'at real "greatness" than that adopted of allowing, for instance, chief justices of states as much voice In selecting scientists, author and art lets, as in selecting lawyers, judges and statesmen. A board of authors, for ex ample, called upon to name a lit of the moat Important literary men of the .country who had died before 1S90, would Hot have omitted Bryant and Poe. A board of artists would probably not, in the voting, have confused the position tof really strong men in our early his tory with much less important men who achieved reputation during a rather barren period, though it should lie not ed that no mistake was made in ad mitting the one artist (Stuart) who did deceive the requisite number of votes. J3ut, as we said, judgment must be sus pended as to the plan of selection at Jeast till the missing twenty-one have been added to the first group. Decem fcer Century. REACHING PARROTS BT PHONO GRAPH. "The phonograph has been put o a lot of strange uses since Its invention," Bald a bird fancier of this city, "but nothing queerer, I believe, than teach ing parrots to talk. That is being done .at present by a dealer in Philadelphia, and as soon as I can get hold of the apparatus I am going to try it myself. !A young fellow, who formerly wirked Jn his shop described the scheme to me In detail. It seems that he secured what is called a 'switchback' phono graph, which was constructed as an ex periment for a school of languages. It Jiad a simple attachment that pushed back the cylinder at the end and start ed It over again automatically, the idea being to fix certain foreign phrases in the memory of the scholars by con stant repetition. The dealer now pre pares a record containing some senten ces or expression which he desires to teach his birds, groups several cages about the mouth of the horn and sets the thing going. It has an electric mo tor, and keeps on grinding out that one phrase all day long. He jipes a small vacant room for the purpose, so there Is nothing to distract the parots' aten tion, and merely locks the door and jroes about his business, leaving the machine to do the rest. The young man told me that the plan proved a perfect success, and the birds learned their lesson in about one-tenth of the time that is usually required to drill anything into heir heads. Moreover, they would pick up phrases twice the ordinary length, and the monotonous (reiteration seemed to fix the words thoroughly In their memory. He said that several parrots that have never be fore been able to talk soon learned by the new method, and that there was mot a single case in which it failed. . I liave the address of the man who made the 'switchback' machine, and I am going to ry to get him to .build one for ma.

BORED BY SWELLDOM. Why Many Weil-Known Wits Decline Invitations of the Fashionable World Persons of wealth and position in the fashionable world, who invite clever, all-round good fellows with a reputa tion in the world of art, letters, or some other calling, to attend formal dinners in their homes are often disappointed in their guests, says the New York Telegiam. In other words, to use a slang expression, the geniuses do not deliver the goods expected of them in the way of entertaining nd their hosts afterward declare they have been great ly over-rated- The cause .tor all this is not always due to the gufest, however, according to a Well-known literary man, for at form al dinners, with all the accompaniment of liveried servants, it is often impossl ble for a man to "jolly up," no matter how clever he may be. Up in New Rochelle, where there is a colony of clever men, Including Freder ick Remington, the artist; Tom Masson, the writer; Francis Wilson, the corn median; George B. Mallon, editor and writer, and others of that ilk, society Is of a different shade, and no one up there votes any dinner a bore. Of course, none of these bright lights would openly say that dinners given by the ultra-frvshlonable set bored them, for they receive many invitations to dine in New York, and often get great pleasure irom tnem, out at the same time they frequently find it lnconven lent to decline, "because New Rochelle is so far away." Speaking for himself, a well known literary man said the oth er day: "I hope to be delivered from many of the dinners among the so-called swell set this winter. Bohemlanism of a cer tain kind grates upon the sensibility of a refined man, but a little of that spir it is a good thing for cehtain wealthy entertainers to cultivate. "A man cannot feel or act In any thing but a frigid way when he is sur rounded by obsequious butlers and arti ficial ice bergs. The wealth and fash ion are really not to blame always; it is the persons who are such everlasting .sticklers for stiffness and prnnrietv that makes one think of funerals and padded cells. For me, give me less form and more good-fellowship." ANTHONY CARROLL'S CHARGES. Another Hearing Before the Special Committee Last Night. The special committee on the charges preferred by Anthony Carroll against City Engineer Kelly held another hear ing last night and despite the storm there was a large attendance to hear the testimony and watch the proceed ings. Mr. Nettleton, an employe of the city engineering department, who was on the stand when the last preceedlng hearing adjourned was again called to the stand at the opening of last night's session. He was questioned by Mr. Carroll concerning details of the work on the Grove street pavement and cross questioned by Attorney W. H. Ely, who appears as counsel for Mr. Kelly. Mr. Gillette, another employe of the engineering department, was called and was questioned along the same lines as was Mr. Nettleton. The hearing ad journed at 10:45 and the next session will be held next Tuesday evening. POLICE AND FIRE BOARDS. Regular Meetings Were Hold Last Night. Tne puijee cuiiiiuiabiuuiiib ana the lire commissioners held meetings last night but no business of special importance was transacted. The police board dis cus &ed some transfers in the accounts cf their departments which they will afk the board cf finance to make. Among the transfers which will be ask ed for is one of $150 from the heating account. The superintendent's monthly report was read and placed on file. The fire commissioners signed the usual batch of bills and held a brief session. Patrolman Phelps was to have been placed on trial before the police board last nicht on charges which have been prepared against him, but he was ill and the trial was postponed. FAVORS NICARAGUA ROUTE PltEIAMlNAllY ItEItOItT OF CANAL COHHISS ION. Cost of (he Nicaragua Project Estimated ut 820(,64O,(JOO-BiisIs of tlie Kstlniateg Comparative Cost of the Panama Canal Dlflioulty of Acquiring Rights Over That Route. Washington, Dec. 4. The report of the Isthmian canal commission, submit ted by the president to congress to-day, gives a3 the unanimous conclusion of that body that "the most practicable and feasible route for an Isthmian ca nal, under the control, management, and ownership of the United States, is known as the Nicaragua route." The commission estimates the cost of this route at ?200,DiO,UO3. This estimate is much In excess of any heretofore made, and is due to increased dimensions and other features not heretofore consider ed. The commission estimates the cost of a canal by the Panama route at $142, 342,579, according to one route, or $156, 37S.25S according to another route. As between the Nicaragua and Panama routes the commission sums up a num ber of advantages favorable to the for mer. It states also that under the con cession given by the Panama govern ment to the Panama Canal company that company is not free to grant the necessary rights to the United States except upon conditions made by the company. Thexreport is a document of about 17,000 words. A detailed description is given of the trip over the several routes. Along the Nicaragua route, it was found that the short section of partially constructed canal ia perhaps in as good shape to day as it was when the work was stop ped. The buildings, however, are all rotten, and the dredgers, boats, etc., are worthless. The commission visited President Zelaya and other leading of ficers of Nicaragua, and found them greatly interested in the project. The occupation of their territory by the United States for canal purposes did not seem to be regarded as a serious ob stacle, provided the sovereignty of the republic was respected. Along the Panama route the commis sion found a large force of workmen engaged upon the canal line, about 2,000 in number, according to the Panama company. The canal had been opened to some extent at both ends. Immense quantities of machinery, implements and tools were found along the route. Much of this property, the commission reports, is ill adapted to American methods of work, and all of It Is now from thirteen to twenty years old, so that no value should be given to the plant now on the isthmus. A visit was also made to President Igleslas of Costa Rica and his cabinet, and a strong sen timent found" to exist for an American canal along the Nicaragua route. Trips were also made along the Darlen route. THE 

COMMISSION'S CONCLUSIONS. The final conclusion of the commis sion are stated as follows: (1). The estimated cost of building the Nicaragua canal Is about $58,000,000 more than that of completing the Pan ama canal, leaving out the cost of ac quiring the latter property. This meas ures the difference in the magnitude of the obstacles to be overcome in the actual construction o( the two canals, and covers all physical considerations such as the greater or less height of the dams, the greater or less depth of cuts, the presence or absence of natural har bors, the presence or absenoe of a rail road, the exemption from or liability to disease, and the amount of work re maining to be done. The new Panama Canal company has shown no disposition to sell its property to the United States. Should that com pany be able or willing to sell, there is reason to believe that the price would not be such as would make the total cost to the United States less than that of the Nicaragua canal. (2). The Panama canal after comple tion would be shorter, have fewer locks, and less curvature than the Nicaragua canal. The measure of these advan tages is the time required for a vessel to pass through, which is estimated for an average ship at twelve hours for Panama and thirty-three hours for Nicaragua. On the other hand, the dis tance from San Francisco to New York is 377 miles, to Now Orleans 579 miles, and to Liverpool 3SR miles greater via Panama than via Nicaragua. The time equired to pass over these distances being greater than the difference in the time of transit through the canals, the Nicaragua line, after completion, would be somewhat the more advantageous of the two to the United States, notwith standing the greater cost of maintain ing the longer canal. The government of Colombia, in which lies the Panama canal, has granted an exclusive concession, which has many years to run. It is not free to grant the necessary rights to the United States, except upon condition that an agree ment be reached with the new Panama Canal company. The commission be lieves that euch an agreement is im practicable. So far as can be ascer tained, the company is not willing to sell its franchise, but it will allow the United States to become owner of part of its stock. The commission considers such an arrangement inadvisable. The governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, on the other hand, are untram melled by concessions and are free to grant to the United States such privi leges as may be mutually agreed upon. In view of all the facts, and particu larly In view of all the difficulties of cfDta.n'Ti t. rt riTernry i.rit leges and franchises on the Panama route,, and assuming the Nicaragua and Costa Rica recognize the value of the canal to themselves, and are prepared to grant concessions on terms which are reasonable and acceptable to the United States, the commission Is of the opinion that "the most practicable and feasible route for" an Isthmian canal to be "under the control, management and ownership of the United States" is that known as the Nicaragua route.
