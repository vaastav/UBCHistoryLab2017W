The Chicago and Alton railroad has obtained from the W., St L. and P. road, 19 engines and cabooses to assist in its transportation. Col. Sol. Kitchen proposes to com mence the canvass of his Congressional district in southeast Missouri the first day of January next. A careful estimate shows that it willfrequire 200,000,000 pounds of lead to meet the demand in the United States the present year. The wheat crop of this year ex ceeds that of last by 26,000,000 of bushels; the corn crop is greater by 200,000,000 of bushels. The manufacturers of paint in the United States in the year 187S used 67,200,000 pounds of lead in prepar ing that article of commerce.

Here is the way an Arkansas pa per puta it up : " The people need ed ucation, they need manufactories, they need churches, they need public schools, in fact they need everything but to vote for Grant." Now that 5V. B. Cornell has been elected governor of New York maybe he will be able to satify some of the $129,395 of judgements against him on file in the clerk's office, Tompkins county, New York. Sedalia Democrat: The Inter- Ocean wants to know if the people will support Grant. They have had to support him and his whole family for eighteen years, and to make mat ters worse, he raised his own wages on us. .

Now, if Mr. Gould wants our stock in Missouri roads he should call at cur office at once, or we may conclude not to sell. The river improvement convention is in session in jjouisvuie, iy., tnis week. The object of this meeting is to collect statistics and keep the sub ject of river improvement before con gress, in order to induce that body to make the necessary appropriation for improvements in the Western rivers. A Democratic meeting in Philadel phia was broken up by a mob Monday, Three men were shot and one killed The soldiers should be sent to Radical Philadelphia to preserve order. But then it is a Radical town, north of Mason and Dixon's line. Radicals did the shooting, and it is all right with Radicals. The Quincy Herald says: "Brick Poraoroy, that hideous deformity ot American politics, has become dis gusted with a lack of encouragement in the greenback cause, and has an nounced his intention 'of taking a go- as-you-please position in politics democrats win be rejoiced to know that he has no intention of trying to crowd himself into their ranks.

It appears now that the meteoric display, predicted by Prof. Tice, was a partial success, at least. Parties in Washington county in this state, who happened to be in the woods between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 14th of November last, witnessed a meteoric shower of wonderful bril liancy, accompanied by loud ex plosions. The statement is verified by other parties in that county. It is said that when Mr. Gould bought the Missouri Pacific road he drew his personal check in payment of same to the amount of $3,800,000, but Commodore Garrison demanded the gold. Gould took his check over to the sub-treasury offico and had it cash ed. The delivery weighed ten tons and seven hundred' pounds, all in double eagles, which were carted over to Garrison's vaults and corded up. The Quincy Haald tells ua that during the month of October 104 railway accidents were reported in the United States. . They resulted in the death of 30 persons and the wounding of 99. During the year ending Octo ber 1, 1S79, the numler of railway ac cidents was 836, by which 182 persons were killed and 684 injured. In the previous year there were 758 accidents, 204 persons killed and 740 injured." Superintendent Hazz, of the Mil waukee house of correction, has been pronounced incompetent to discharge the duties of that office by a commit tee appointed by the state board of re formers to investigate the prison in stitutions of that city. The committee found that Hazz was not only incom petent, but that his treatment of the inmates of the prison was inhuman and barbarous, and concluded its re port by recommending his removal. Gen. and Mrs. Grant left Galena Wednesday for Chicago, where they will remain several days, then visit the cities of the East, and sail for Havana the latter part of the month, Thev will remain in Havana part of the winter, their go to Mexico, and af ter visiting the principal cities of that qountry return via Galveston in April, going direct to Denver, and from there visiting the mining districts, including I.eadyille. lhis is the latest pro gramme. If the Uhulicothe Lonstuutwn pro poses to give us "blue blazes" every time we throw a hint into its lap as to how things look, viewed through our political horoscope from the Courier observatory, fuither suggestions in this line must cease at once ; those " high' toned, gilt-edged delegates " will re ceive the benefits of our silence On the subject and may yet succeed in "cornering" the irrcpressable Colonel in hia own ' corner." Under the circumstances now we can only say "Go in and get squeezed." Frank Lane and Buffalo Bill Smith, leaders of tho mob that recent ly hung Bill Young near Luray, Clark county, this state, have been arrested These are tho two men for whom Gov Phelns offered rewards. It is most likely that before they are through with this matter tho murderers of Young will find that they cannot ride rough-shod over tho laws ot tins state, It does seem that in some cases men who should hayo been hung lor mur der have been allowed to go free, but we aro glad to see that there is a dis position among the officials throughout the ofitire Btato to vigorously enforce the laws against criminals. This thing must bo done. " Let no guilty man escape." : A number of prominent citizens of Ray county have inaugurated a move ment looking towards an extension of tho Burlington and Southwestern rail road from Laclede to Kansas City. In furtherance of tho movement a -large and enthusiastic mass meeting was held in Richmond, December 2d. Judge Dunn presided over the meeting, and after explaining its objects appoints a committee to comer with the repre e!i(jiM of that corporation to secure their ct-f)Nfr ration tLti enterprise If they sue roso, Republicanism has beqomCas dis reputable in the Old Bay state as it is in Maine, if the returns from the last election are any indication of its stand ing. ' Long, -th Republican candidate forgovernor, received at the recent election only 1,760 more votes thah the combined vote of tho opposition. This is a considerable reduction in the strength of a party that was able to give Grant in 18C8 a majority of 86, 069, and to almost' repeat the same thing in 1S72 by giving him a major ity of 74,212, and still later, to give Hayes a majority over Tilden in 1876, of 41,285 votes. The cultivation of the peanut has become a largo and profitable industry in the states of Virginia, North Caro lina and Tennessee. Tho harvest be gins about the middle of September and clones from the middle to tho last of October. These states furnish near ly the entire supply for this country. The crop this ye.ir is estimated to be the largest ever raised in the United States. Virginia will furnish the market with 1,000,000 bushels ; Ten nessee, 600,000 bushels; and North Carolina, 125,000 bushels. The value of the crop in these states last year was $1,500,000. The Msssissippi Valley (Jane Grow ers association met in fet. .Louis this week. Thirty states and territories were represented in the convention. The object of the meeting was to pro vide ways and means for utilizing the surplus cane for the manufacture of sugars. A quantity ot sugar made from the juice of this plant will be ex hibited in that city by different mem bers of the convention. The delibera tions of this association will developo a new interest in this useful branch of industry, as it is confidently expected that its influence will soon begin to manifest itself in the price of sugar. This would indeed be a triumph of American enterprise over all competi tion in this line. A Washington special to the Cin cinnati Enquirer of November 25 says the scheme to make urant a captain general in the army, with a regal salary, seems to be popular with his friends and his enemies, with Re publicans and Democrats. The Re publicans that is, those who don't want to see him President again will support the proposition, because it will shelve him as a Presidential can didate. For the same reason the Democrats will unite in the movement. The average Democrat seems to be imbued with the idea that if Grant can be gotten out of the way there is good chance for electing a Demo cratic President. Any Democrat who is so soft as to be caught, in such a trap should bo decapitated, or sent to the insane asylum. " Grant is our lit et choice for tho Re publican nomination of president. It will make a square issue between tho 'strong man' people and thoso who favor a strict adherence to the constitution. Wo hope he will get the nomination. If the Demo crau ennnet beat him with his eight years' record as president, they cannot beat any body. Besides the issue between the Kmpire and the 'Republic' had as well be made and fought out now as at anytime ; in fact, better now than hereafter. Yes, Republican fricnds,nomiiiatehun. Common honesty demands it of you. You want a srtong man. Puthira up, and if the mass es of the people North and South don't consign biin and his trainers to political ob livion, then we have over estimated their virtue, intelligence and devotion to the Federal Union." The above from the Paris Mercury fully sets forth our views on the sub ject referred to. The idea of any Democrat, North or South, voting for Grant, the mau who for eight years headed the most corrupt administra tion this country ever knew, is simply nonsense. We believe Grant to be the weakest man yet named by the Republicans for the presidency, but if we can't beat him, why just let him win. Our experience is that there is but little difference in the honesty of Radical leaders, anvhow. The East has begun to realize that the influence it has so long exercised over the destiny ot the American TTnmn iu nliouf. tn Vn f rnnsfprred t.n other sections of the country. TW rapid growth of tho West in wealth, and in population, has deprived it of that political importance that charac terized it at the beginning of the pres ent century. The republic that fram ed the constitution ot I tot is not the same republic that developed the won derful resources of the West. But of this vast district new states have been organiied, and new industries have en tered into competition with tho pro ducts ot its populus cities, lhe supe riority of the West in industrial and commercial importance has car ried with it a corresponding superior ity in political influence which is des tined io remove the onter of political power from the seaboard to the agn cultural district beyond the Mississippi. Speaking of this matter the New York llerahl savs : " It is evident that tho scepter is rapidly passing from the sea board states, and even from tho cen tral states between the great lakes and the Mississippi. The geographical center of tho Union long since crossed the Mississippi, and the center of pop ulation is rapidly approaching it. Un der these circumstances it behooves the citizens of tho Eastern states riously to meditate upon the probable consequences of the impending redis tribution of political power. Of course the national growth in population and wealth is a matter for congratulation rather than apprehension, and if the present national institutions should prove to bo too strait a garment for the young Western giant there is no fear that tho wisdom of the present genera- ined in the practice of repub- j 11 not prove fullv t ors of 1787, If the Posl-Ditin(ch expects to run I Senator P.ayard for p e.ipent it would better cork him up on the financial question. He stuck his foot into it badly last spring by his conduct in re gard to the silver bill, and we see that Wednesday he truckled to John Sher man's suggestion, and introduced a joint resolution providing that "treas ury notes of the United States shall be receivable for all dues to the United States, excepting duties on imports, and shall not be otherwise a legal ten der, and any of said notes hereafter re issued shall bear this superscription." If Mr. Bayard, or anyone else, suppos es that the recent elections have so scared Democrats that they aro will ing to join hands with the stock gam blers, national banks, and thieves of the moneyed corporations, and their associates in the Radical party, in fur ther robbing the peopleof this country, they will find when too late that they have reckoned without their host. It is true that in many instances last year Democrats departed from the old and true faith on this subject, and it is also true that many of them have been on the stool of repentance since the late elections. But on this sub ject the national Democracy have been straight all the time. The party fa vors a sufficient circulating medium, issued by the government, and found ed upon a coin basis, to supply the wants of commerce. The Democratic party stopped the contraction of green backs at a little over $346,000,000, when the Radicals were selling bonds and burning greenbacks as fast as pos sible. For this piece of wiso legesla tion, which has done much toward the revival of business, tho Democratic party deserves and will receive praises from the American masses, and it is not likely they will go back on their record. The Democratic party re stored silver as a money of thecountry, which had been swept away as by a thief at night. This legislation stands out conspicuously as an act of simple justice to the people, and wise states manship, to the credit of the party, and no retrograde movement in this line is in order. No, the Democratic party wants no fiat foolishness, neither does it propose to tolerate any nation-al-bank-single-standard-of-gold thieve yr, and president nominators may as well understand this fact, and the sooner the better. A report is current among politi cians and newspaper correspondents in Washington that a well matured plan for inaugurating a Republican presi dent in 1881 has been successfully or ganized among governmental officials in that city. The recent proposition of Gen. Sherman to provide additional barrack accommodations at the arsenal near the capital, has been construed by the opponents of that measure as a movement in that direction. Whether this was the object Gen. Sherman had in view or not, the proposition is enough to provoke some comment at least. The idea of garrisoning the capital in times of profound peace is well calculated to excite a suspicion that there is some sinister design at the bottom of it. The history of the electoral commission of 1877 has pre pared the public mind to receive most anything coming from that direction as a fraud. The principal occupation of the peo ple of West Falmouth, Massachuseets, is tying strings to the tags found at tached to numerous articles of mer chandise. These tags are cut in Bos ton and sent to West Falmouth, ac companied by a sufficient amount of twine to supply each tag with a string of suitable length to answer the pur pose for which it is employed. After receiving this necessary preparation it is returned to the manufacturers at Boston. This seems to be a small business, yet it furnishes employment to more than four hundred persons in West Falmouth. The renumeration received is seventeen cents per thous and. Senator McDonald, dicussing presidential aspirants in an interview, says: " Mr. Hendricks is undoubted ly the choice of the Indiana Democracy tor the Presidency, and 1 can see no Gooa reason wny any Democrat any where should not support him loin Hendricks, as he is called, is truly a noble Koman, and there are a great many Democrats in this country who would como nearer " boiling over" in a campaign under hia leadership, than under that on any other man, except perhaps beymour and it is true there is " no good reason why any Democrat any where should not support him." Washington Whispers. December 1. lhe congreasmen who have arrived for the session which opens to-uay are very tree in express ing their choice for candidates of their respective parties for the presidency, It is clear, that among Republicans Gaant is the first cr second choice of a great majority. Next to him, doubt less, Blaine has the largest following. Both these men, but for very different reasons, are more popular among the people at large, than among the prom inent politicians of the country, Among Democrats the list is longer. and I find also a strong disposition'to attempt to unite upod some man not heretofore prominently mentioned in connection with the office. Dakota vui Washington territories will probably ask that steps prelimi nary to their admission as states be taken. However, Washington an Dakato will probably find it more dif ficult to gain admission into the Union than it would have been years ago, when party necessity forced tho Rad cals to admit a state wherever a res-. taurant and a miniug camp could be formed. One of the new ideas ot tho preson session is a " National Mining Buroau, -, ,.,w-tl :in" to r'ivo abroad and iit dorsement to our mines and mining products. The proposed measure is specially waged now by those interest ed in mining property in tho South ern states, but it is thought Western mines will use their influence in the same direction. If possible, the Louisiana liars, who are now testifying to keep Kellogg in his seat in the senate are excelling in their line of industry, the pioneers who swore Tilden out and Hayes in. Those Louisiana Radicals are a re markable set of men. They must have mane cbarruing rulers for a great state. The governor of South Carolina has just said something to the governor of North Carolina and to the people of all the states, which is very interest ing. In his late annual message he gives tho state's expenses for the last year to have been one-third less what they were in the most economical years of Radical rule, says that more chil dren are attending the public schools than ever before, there being as many as 45 per cent, more colored children so instructed than in any previous year, and the state has money in its treasury. This is not the condition of things Narthern Radicals are made to believe exists in South Caro lina, or any other Southern state. General Grant will be here some time during the winter. Besides the general celebration by the public, his friends are attempting to secure for him a kind of reception by congress when ho visits the house or senate, which will be out of the ordinary line of such affairs. The General has a great many fool-friends. Reno. 

GRANT NOT LIKE CEORCE. The Paris Mercury submits the fol lowing suggestive inquiries in com parison of characters of Grant and Washington : " Some say that Grant is like our George. Lot's see. Did Washington ever pardon a whisky ring thief? No. Did he ever take presents for ap pointments? No. Did he ever request a friend to speculate in gold and then manipulate the strings so that that friend would win ? No. Did ho ever accept bull pups and horses as presents ? No. Did he wish to be Emperor and rule three terms? No. Did he ever try to buy and sell San Domingo ? No. Did he ever attempt to bulldoze an attorney who was prosecuting a thief? No. Did he ever lend himself as a tool to to make tho rich man richer and the poor devil poorer still? No. Well, we guess Grant is. not much like G. W. Not any, in fact, not even hardly ever.' " BEECHER ON MISSOURI " The breadth of land from the Red River country of the far north stretch ing to the gulf of Mexico, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and Texas, is one of the most wonderful agricultural spectacles on the globe. It is one of the facts that are unthinkable. In this ocean of land, and at nearly its centre, is the imperial state of Missouri. Even a Kansas man admits that in natural qualifications it leads all the rest, and is the crown and glory of the Union. It has boundless treasures of coal, iron, lead and other minerals; lands, richer there cannot be, nor finer streams ; its forests are more equally distributed all over the State than any other; its climats, wholesome and de lightful, blends the temperature of the northern lakes and the great southern gulf." CRANT AND THE SOUTH. Tthe Okolma States, which has been so extensively patronized and read by Republicans as a truly good and hon est paper, has the following, which our Republican exchanges are request ed to quote : " We have heretolore remarked that only the lowest of our low population have given the Grant boom a hoist. Wherever you find A bug juice thief, A desperado of whatever predilec tion, A gilded mud-sill, or An unprincipled place beggar, You will find a follower of Grant."
