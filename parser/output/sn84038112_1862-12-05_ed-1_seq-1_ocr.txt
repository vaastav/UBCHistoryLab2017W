The licit has so radically changed, for upations and habits ot the American peoplo, has uecessarily disturbed the social condition, aud affected very deeply the prosperity of tho nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily in creasing throughout a period of half a century. It Iiuh at tho satno limo excited political d apprehensions, which have produced a the civilized usual agitation wo have for borne from taking putt in any controversy bo foreign »States and between parties or fac n such Slates. Wo httve attempted no propagatidism, and ac knowledged no revolution : b every nation the exclusive conduct and manage - ment of its Uur struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to i merits thau to its supposed and ofteu exaggera ted effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint tits part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly bo unwise. The treaty with Groat Britain for tho suppres sion of tho slave trade has been put into opera tion with a good prospect of complete success.— It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknow ledge that the execution of it, on tho part of her Majesty's Government, lias been marked with a jealous respect lor tho authority of the Uuited .States aud the rights of their moral aud loyal oitiseos. Tho oonventiou with Hanover for the abolition of the Stadt dues has been carried into full ef fect under the uot of Congress for that purpose. A blockade of three thousand utiles of bu established and rigorously of great commercial activity without committing occasional mistakes, und indicting unintentional iujuries upon foreign nations and their subjects. A civil ocourring in a country where foreigu side, und carry ou trade under treaty stipula te, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of ueutral lights. All such collisions hensions and, possibly, olamations between nations which have a interest in preserving peace aud friendship, in clear cases of these kinds I ha possible, beard aud redressed complaints which e been presented by friendly p There is still, however, a large aud an aug menting number of doubtful ouses, upon which Government is unable to agree with the Governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in whioh the United States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs i tho naval or military authorities of foreigu nations, which the Governments of these States prepared to redress. I have pro dosed to some of the foreigu States thus interest ed, mutual conventions to examine und adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made esueuiully to Ureut Britain, to France, to Spain, aud to 1'russia. In each case it has been kiudly received, but has uot yet been formally adopted. 1 deem it my duty to reeomnieud and appro priation in behalfof the owners of the Norwegian imrk Admiral I*. Tordiuskiold, which vessel in May 1801, prevented by the commander of the bloukudiug force off Charleston lroin leaving tbut port witli a cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had, shortly before, been grauted to un English vessel. 1 have directed tho Heore tury of Stute to he communicated Applications have been made free Americans of African desoeut to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization contemplated iu recent uots ot Cougress.— Other purties at homo and abroad—some from interested motives, others upon patriotic sidérations, uud still others iutiueuced by phi lanthropic sentiments—have suggested similar measures ; while, oj the other hand, several of tho Spauish-Auiericau Republics lmvo protested against the sending of such colonies tu their pective territories.

The uew commercial treaty between the Uni ted StutcB und the Sultau of Turkey bus been carried into execution. A commercial and sular treaty bus been negotiated, subject t Senate's cousent, witli Liberia, and a i. negotiation is now peudiug with the republio of Huyti. A considerable improvement of the na tioual commerce is expected to result trom these measures. Our relutious with Great Britain, F Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands Italy, Rome, and the other European States, remain uudis turbed.

In accordance with the purpose expressed iu the secoud para graph of that paper, 1 now lespcctfully call your attention to what may be called " Compensative Emanoipatiuu." A uatlou may be said to consist cf its territo ry, its people, and its laws. Tbe territory is tbo only part which is of certain durability.— " One generation passe th away and another generation cometli, but the earth abideth foievcr." It is of the first importance to duly consider aud estimate this portion of the earth's surface which i aud inhabited by the people of the Uuited Stntes is well adapted to be tbe home of tional family, aud it is not well adapted f< more. Its aud productions age for oue people, whatever they might ha been iu former ages. Steam, telegraphs, aud intolligeuce have brought these to be au advantageous combination for one united people. In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of dis »edy for tho differences between the people of the two sections. I did so iu lan guage which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg leave to repeat: " Oue section of our country believes slavery d ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong, und ought extended.

While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much niple of seccssiou breeding lesser , indefinitely, would retard population, civ ilization, und prosperity, no one can doubt that the exteut of it will be very great aud injurious.
