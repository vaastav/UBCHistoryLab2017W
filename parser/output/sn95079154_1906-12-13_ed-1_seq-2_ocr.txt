THURSDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1906. A SHRINKING ELECTORATE. We publish in another column the official vote cast in Virginia at the re? cent Congressional election. The fig? ures disclosed in the report are start? ling, and should awaken the apprehen? sions of all good citizens who do not wish to see the State controlled by an oligarchy or corrupt political machine. The first election held in Virginia under the new Constitution was the Congress? ional election of 1902. There had been but one registration under the new or? ganic iaw and nearly all the negro vote had been disfranchised and nearly one half the white vote had declined or had been refused registration. Yet, at the first election held under the Constitu? tion, and with only one partisan regis? tration of voters, in the Congressional election of 1902 we find that 122,294 votes were polled^in the ten districts of the State. Since that election there have been four additional registrations and the registered vote in the State has been very considerably increased. But with a largely increased registered vote We find that the vote of 1902 , (122,294), was reduced in 1906 to 85,827, a loss of 36,467. Only about one out of every four white men of voting age in the Commonweslth voted at the late Con? gressional election. This dangerous re? duction in the voting electorate of the State is due entirely to the vicious reg? istration and election laws that have been introduced under the new Consti? tution. Another remarkable disclosure made by the election returns for 1906 is that 25,565 votes were polled in the Ninth Congressional District, while the com? bined vote in the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Sixth Districts was only 25,472. Thus it will be seen that 93 more votes were polled in the Ninth than in the five districts above men? tioned. Another disclosure made is, that the combined vote received by Maynard, Lamb, Lassiter and'Glass, Democrats elected to Congress from the Second, Third, Fourth and Sixth Districts, amounted to 14,941, while the vote for Campbell Slemp was 13,798, just 1,143 less than the four above named Con? gressmen, combined, received. And Colonel Slemp represents a larger vot? ing constituency than the five Demo? cratic Congressmen who reposent the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Sixth Districts. Still another telling disclosure made by the election of 1906 is that Colonel Slemp received 104 more votes for Con? gress in 1906 than he did in 1902, while "his Democratic competitor in 1906, Mr. Bruce, received 1,719 fewer votes than Colonel Slemp's competitor, Judge Rhea, received in 1902. In 1902 the vote for Slemp was 13,694 and for Rhea 13,476. In 1906 the vote for Slemp was 13,798 and for Bruce 11,757. The vote of the Ninth Congressional District was about one-third of the en? tire vote polled in the State. This shows that by persistent effort the Republicans of this district are doing more to preserve the electorate of Vir? ginia than everything else combined. ??p NO MORE ISOLATION ON THE FARM. In the last few years the farmers of Brown county have fitted up their country homes with nearly every con? venience, such as bath and toilet rooms, telephones and furnaces. With mail delivery every day and good roads they are even more comfortably situated than their city brethren. John Leidy, a farmer living near Robinson, has gone them all one better by installing a complete electric light plant on his place, which lights his house, bams, cow sheds, corn cribs and graneries. A gasoline engine runs the dynamo for the plant.?Kansas City Journal. This same prosperous condition of the farmers not only prevails in the en? tire State of Kansas but in every State of the Union. It will be remembered that Mr. Bryan's most vigorous as? saults upon the Republican policies in 1896 were made because he declared that the adoption and operation of those policies would be ruinous to the agricultural interests of the country. The Democratic party united with him in so declaring. Mr. Bryan and the Democracy also asserted that the tariff policy of the Republican party would greatly injure the laboring men of the country. In this latter claim they have been as greatly mistaken as they were in their prophecies as to hov. the farmers would be affected. It is an admitted fact, by all intelli? gent men, that when the agricultural and laborii g classes are prosperous that all classes do well, as it is true that a nation's measure of prosperity is regu? lated by the condition of the farmer and the laborer. But our Democratic friends still assail the Republican policy of protection, after an experience of more than nine years which shows that their judgment has been unsound. If the people are wise they will turn a deaf ear to Democratic arguments and let well enough alone. The only fault that the Richmond Times-Dispatch finds with President Roosevelt's message, is that he makes no suggestion for tariff revision. The chief fault which the News Leader finds with the message is, that the Pres? ident does not advocate State banks of issue. Mr. Roosevelt, is a Republican and could not consistently, with his be? lief in the principles of his party, favor such tariff revision as is wanted by the Democrats or the creation of State banks of issue. To advocate these things would be to proclaim himself a Demo? crat. -*?* The President's Message. (Philadelphia Press). The great activity of President Roose? velt's mind and the multifariousness of the interests which engage his atten? tion are reflected in this annual mes? sage. He has a great deal to say, and compression is not his specialty. His message is, therefore, very long, with? out at all exhausting his material. He has reserved Panama for a special mes? sage, and no doubt as the occasion arises will lay before Congress during the ses? sion still other matters which he shall consider "necessary and expedient for their consideration." The Government has invoked the criminal law to enforce the legislation of Congress, and it finds the limitation of the Government's right of appeal a serious handicap. The rights of the pub? lic are no less to be considered than those of the accused, but at present they are not equally protected. The President argues at length on this head, and in the course of his discussion ex? presses views that will subject him to attack from those who hold that a Judge is as sacred as a grand llama and above all human criticism. But as the Presi? dent only six months ago induced Con? gress to make an important change in the law in regard to the immunity of witnesses, so his present earnest criti? cisms may induce Congress to change the law so that a District Judge's de? cision shall no longer be conclusive with the Government, while the law allows the accused to have his exceptions re? viewed by every Appellate Court in suc? cession. While asking for the Government greater liberty of appeal from lower courts, the President jealously defends the proper prerogatives of the Courts. He upholds the right of injunction with precautions against possible abuse of power, and he condemns lynch law with all the vigor at his command. As a cure for the peculiar evil which incites lynch law in the South the President recommends the better education of the negro and "the swift, relentless and or? derly punishment of criminals under the law. " In discussing these and the vex? ed and delicate question of capital and labor, the President seeks to evade noth? ing, but speaks with courage, clearness and reasonableness on all these topics. His conclusions may not be accepted by those who see only one side of the shield, but they will have convincing power with the candid and fairminded. While holding out for a firm Govern? ment control of railroads, the President claims that the prohibition against rail? road combination is futile and is wrong, because a railroad may want to combine for a good purpose, and this freedom of action should not be denied it. He de velopes his scheme of a graduated in? heritance tax and touches on the possi? bility of an income tax which the Su? preme Court may approve. He reiter? ates his reeommendation that Congress pass the ship subsidy bill, and lends the "weight of his approval to the proposed authorization of taxed emergency bank currency. He is as ever a believer in a strong navy. He does not urge an in? crease in the strength of our present navy beyond that already authorized. He insists that it should be maintained in strength by promptly replacing all worn out and obsolete vessels with mod? ern new ones. The President is full of his subj?act, which is the country and its require? ments, and he gives Congress much to think about and suggests for it work which is apparently in excess of a short session's capacity. It is the President's duty under the Constitution "to give the Congress information concerning the state of the Union," and this re? quirement President Roosevelt performs in the message in an ungrudgingly liber? al measure. His message, as a whole, is conservative in spirit and will be well received by the country.

The principal objection to all health resorts and preventive cures is that they do not give any place for intellectual ex? ercise, which is just as important as muscular exercise or fresh air. A per? son will get a better appetite by three hours' hard study of philosophy or ma? thematics than he will from a three hour game of baseball. Man was made to think. The processes of his nature are all served and strengthened by study. Thinking fires up the furnaces of the capillaries just us much as ham? mering out a horseshoe. It is as neces? sary to health to exercise the brain fibre as it is the biceps muscle. The less'real hard study we have the more Americanitis there is. Indeed, this malady is the penalty of not think? ing. The first thing a neurologist should do is to prescribe'a dose of study to his patient, so as to'exercise the brain and send a current of fresh blood up there. This is not an encouragement of brain fag; the brain needs rest, as the mus? cles do; but it doesn't need rest till it wearies. An encyclopedia before us says brain work is not unfavorable to longevity, and then it goes on to give a list of great thinkers who lived to a verj old age, enough to prove that study pro? longed life. It is in accord with a divine purpose that it should; not it alone, pos? sibly, but joined with fresh air, whole? some food and physical exercise. All these go together to make health. So hard study help3 the body, and books of instruction are wholesomer than books of entertainment. There is one thing that is not overdone, and that is think? ing.
