TREATY WIL CARRY DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION WILL, By TACIT RATHER THAX AG GRESSIVE SOUTHERNERS MUST COINCIDE l'eople Beyond Mason's and DixOn's Line Wout the Increased Chances for Trade That Are Offered. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. — The only rruatiure of importance which the senate hub on its ia;enuar for the present week is tile new Hay-Jfauncefote treaty, mak ing i^rovision for the abiogation of the CUyton-Buiwer treaty and opening the W*y for the unobstructed construction of Isthmian canai by the United States. Acftng for the committee on fore.gn rela tions, Senator L,ouge will ask tne senate tv go into executive session tomorrow for the consideration of the treaty and (i.iy thereafter until the convention is ui.sposed of. It can be said that at this time the ipect is very strong that the treaty will be raatied, and it now looks as if this result would be secured after com uaratively little delay. There will be • debate, and some features of the <i<iunuiit will be criticised as undesir able. but there is no probability of cap- Uous opposition. The criticism will be '• along the lines indicated oy Senators ilijnty and iiacon, in the committee on foreign relations, at its meeting on Fri day last. No stnaior thus far, however, has shown a disposition to carry his ob- ■.; jections to the point of ultimate effort to !■■ ce:eut raiiticat.ion.~-iHe principal-autno.s' ij of the criticism of the treaty are South. --i trn" senators, who. are, i generally, very ", anxious for the construction of the canal. .) They find that all canal legislation will i be tied up until action can be secured by the treaty, and they are, on this account, 5i less liable than they otherwise would be, | to do anything to delay action upon the .treaty itself. The most active friends of 1 the treaty now claim that ratification, 1 will be secured during the present j week, ■ and the opinion is very general that rati ; fication will be obtained before 'the • Christmas holidays. Reciprocity .Question Postponed. V Beyond the consideration of the treaty very little business will. be undertaken before the holidays in the senate. It is ',_. now generally agreed that the question of ; reciprocity will go over until January, I probably without so much being men tioned, and it may be added that from ■' being for a time the;subject inosl likely I to -attract early attention,, it has taken a ;: position among the matters which will : not be vigorously urged. : _ ■'.-, When the reciprocity treaties do come up for consideration there will be per '". sistent opposition to the agreement with France, and to that with • Great Britain covering the West Indies. . There is not so much feeling over the I conventions ,with South American repub £ lies. The present outlook also is against I any immediate action in the senate look- I ing to tariff legislation for the Philip is pines, and there are some indications | that the senate will wait upon the house I of representatives In this matter. Prob ) ably the Chinese exclusion act will be re k ~ ported from committee during the week. . The nomination of Attorney General i • Knox will be; reported at the first execu- I tive  session, but immedate confirmation s probably will be . antagonized by some » Eenators. ! • . I NEW

Words of Eulogy for Those Who Came Over in Mayflower. "To sum up, I will write upon the ped estal of their monument these wrords a3 most expressive and appropriate: 'To the sublimity of a great conviction!' " Thus did Rev. J. S. Montgomery last evening close the services at Wesley M. E. church, commemorative of Forefathers' day, following it with a warm tribute to President Roosevelt, as follows: "And when, the other day, our presi dent said Turn on the light,' referring to the great trusts and combinations which reach from one end qf this nation to the other, h.s utterance was that of a great- conviction, and God bless the man who spoke the words." It had been announced that Gov. Van Sant. James Gra.v and F. M. Nye would be the speakers upon this occasion, and the promise of so much eloquence served to fill the church io ovtruowuig. 'me entire seating capacity of the great structure was taxed, but it was not suf ficient to accommodate the pe<sple, and hundreds were turned away, while other hundreds stood during the service. Gov.' Van Sant sent word early in the evening that he was suffering from a se vere cold, but would try to come over before the services were ended. He did not appear, however, and the disappoint ment of the audience was evident. The remarks of all the speakers were in the nature of eulog ■ s p Lhe patriot ban 1 who came to this county in the May flower and left to their children and pos terity a heritage of liberty and equality. 

BISHOP M'GGLRICIv SPEAKS. Large Andienee at the Church of the Immaculate Conception. Bishop James McGolrick celebrated the feast of the Immaculate Conception by pontifical mass at Church of the Immac ulate Conception yesterday morning. In tin afternoon he preached to the fifty young women who were accepted into the solidarity. The- afternoon sermon was one of thi> plainest and outspoken se'mons that has ever been heard at the church. The bishop referred to the dangers which sur round the young woman on her start in life. He believed t"hat as a result of th<i abnormal commercial growth there was at the present time a marked ab sfnee in faith, lack of reverence for things holy and an appreciation for the higher things of life. One of the results of this condition is a lack of proper respect for woman.

He had an ailment J which re quired' a-, simple and ' harmless.-surgical . operation. He went to a surgeon of high, repute in Cleveland and arranged to pay' j so much a month. :..; ac surgeon was .will- ■ ing. and it took Rockefeller about a year ,to pay the bill of $40 without interest.; 7 V !

The magnate •: wanted - an other : consultation * regarding tSe old compla'nt. ' and chose to send: for : the; surgeon of his youth.

And wnat do you suppose the waiter brought us? A piece of pie? Oh yes it was pie. They called it pie, at 'any rate. But it was sponge layer cake flavored with lemon. There was cream between the layers, and on the top was some chocolate icing! And this in New England, literally within the shadow of the state house dome.

':- SITUATION IS REMARKABLE Stocks Being: Slowly * Scattered anil Large Sums -of " Money Invested V. :- Hoi Lighten Big Bond holders' Burden. - In his weekly review of the conditions in Wall street, Henry Clews says: The Wall street situation is practically unchanged. On. one side we see stocks powerfully concentrated in a few hands and an attempt made to raise values to a still higher level by means of various deals, by encoi; aging easy money and by other artifices best known to skillful manipulators. Continued prosperity and large railroad earnings have afforded a strong basis for such a movement, and at the moment there are no signs of pro nounced weakness, except the unsatis- factory developments in Amalgamated Copper, which have undoubtedly impeded the efforts ior a renewed bull campaign. The large interests are unquestionably commiLtwd to the long side of the mar ket; they have stocks to sell which the public are slow to buy unless they see more certainty of profit than has been offered. Simple prosperity, some think, has been amply discounted, and reliance is now pften placed upon the effects of deals which promise to increase the divi dend capacities of certain securities. As a result the market is strong only in spots, and weak spells are not infre quent. Had the market been allowed to settle down last summer to a lower lovel in natural response to the unfavorable incidents which then occurred, we should have had a recovery and activity during the last two months which has been notably absent. Th-e public has wisely keep aloof from extensive commitments on the long side, confining its activities to quick trading; and this is likely to be the safe course for some time to come, or until natural influences once more as sert their sway. The situation in some respects is very remarkable. Never before were stocks so highly concentrated; and the steadying power resulting from this process is high ly significant. Apparently the powers in control are able to hold the market im pregnable against all ordinary assaults; and while this situation lasts judgment must be directed accordingly. At the same time stocks are being slowly scat tered, and the large sums of money seek ing investment may enable the market leaders to successfully lighten their bur den if prosperity continues sufficiently long; as some are bold enough to be lieve it wili. But the business situation is spotty. Great activity is apparent in the iron trade where the physical revolu tion in railroad standards Is causing an abnormal demand for iron. There is also great prosperity in the coal trade, and an active demand at profitable prices for many articles of food and clothing. Price for these are the highest In ten years, ard people are spending vastly more on luxuries and commodities appealing to aesthetic tastes than usual. Economy is the exception and extravagance the rule, and how long this will continue no one knows. There are signs of reaction which only the blind will not see, and they de mand caution. We will soon begin to visibly see the effect of the corn crop failure and the consequent loss of freight to lines traversing the corn belt. As a result prices of cattle have risen ab normally. Another blow is the shrinkage in the cotton crop, which must adversely affect important sections of the South. High prices and scarcity are not con ducive to continuous prosperity in spite of a delusion to the contrary which some people entertain. Still another unfavor able feature has been the declines in our exports, which, though perhaps not per manent, indicate a cessation of the ex cessive trade balances which have been a fruitful source of self-congratulation. Our exports of copper declined .about $23 --000,000 during the first ten months of 1901, and our exports of iron manufactures showed a loss of $24,C00,000 in the same period. Such factors as these cannot be ignored. They we signs of our being at or near the top, and common prudence dictates caution in transactions entering into the future. Those who anticipated a "strenuous" message from President Roosevelt were disappointed. The president's first mes sage was a calm and conservative docu ment, entirely free of radical or dema gogical features. While his treatment of disputed questions could not be expected to please everybody, all agreed that his recommendations were strictly within the limits of safety. The financial communi ty was chiefly interested on his utter ances regarding trusts. These he treated in a frank, judicial and temperate spirit; and his ideas upon publicity, needless to say, met with universal approval. If such legislation as he suggests were now in .force Wall street would be free today from one of its worst uncertainties, and Amalgamated Copper would not be the scapegoat of the market. Many of the trust evils would be self-corrective un der reasonable publicity. The president apparently left the currency question tc his able secretary, Mr. Gage, who treats this important problem with unusual force and clearness in his annual report. There is no domestic question of greate importanee for congress to wrestle with" than this one. The country needs a sci- ' entitle and automatic currency system in keeping with modern progress. The change can bast be made under pros perous conditions. When reaction sets in and credit contracts, prejudice and igno rance will be more difficult to overcome than now. Mr. Gage's remarks on the currency should be thoughtfully read by every well-wisher of his country. The president's message is a pronounce. '' ment upon the great affairs of the day ' which will meet with instant and hearty approval both at home and abroad Its eminent conservatism must dispel any ' apprehension of radical recommendations tha.t may perhaps have existed among a few. The president's attitude towards the vast business interests of the country is an earnest of sound judgment and thor ough understanding. The interests of labor and capital have alike and equally ' been considered. The policy of publicity : in regard to the affairs of so-called trusts is a very salutary reeommenda- i tion which must carry with it the opinion I of all fair-minded men. Tariff modifica- j tion is very wisely confined principally to the lines of reciprocity, in fact the entire message may be said to be a guar antee of stability and harmony in gov ernment and foreign affairs, and hence a promise of continued prosperity. The executive and legislative branches of the government, it is quite clear from the message, are to act in harmony, not dis cord, which is a most gratifying assur ance to the business interests of the country. He Saved the Lamp. An amusing scene occurred at the docks yesterday. A Scotch engineer, who wished to go ashore, ordered a boy to show him the way with a lantern. As the boy was crossing the narrow plank that served as a gangway, he slipped and fell into the water. The instinct of the true Scot instantjy showed itself. "Hold on to the lamp, boy!" he shouted, lean in? over toward the water. "Do you hear? If it's lost, there Is 5 shillings gone from your wages." After some time the boy was rescued; half drowned but clinging to the lamp. As some com pei.sstion for his trouble he was forgiven for losing the bottom of it.—London Glebe. A Fine Golf Club. The guide was showing him. the big trees. "This one," be said, "is supposed to be ■about 2,000 years old." "What a twentieth century club it would make!" commented the professor.— Chicago Tribune. 91. ».
