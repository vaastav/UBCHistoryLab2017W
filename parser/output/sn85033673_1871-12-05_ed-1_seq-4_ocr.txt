SWabbinotos, November 4, 1871, The President refer, to the generally sucoeSKful execution of laws, the policy not hoinir to innuire into their wisdom, but to leave it to time to develop their intent and wisdom. Disasters by storm and fire in this country have developed a friendahin on the part of foreign na tions, and the donors will receivo the thanks of men, women and children whose sufferings they lave relieved. Two countries sneaking, the same lan guage, have mado a treaty, an example to be followed by other civilized nations, and finally be the means of reluming to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of na tions by tho sword and bayonet. Pro vision is recommended for the Commis sion to meet at Geneva, and legislation is recommended that will bring into practical cll'ect the questions in the treaty affecting the fisheries and mari time disputes. Tho Governors ol New York. Pennsylvania. Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois have !,pn reouosted to take part in the meas ures of the treaty which determine the use of the canals by the United Stntes and r;rt. Rritnin. A true bonndury be tween the United States and Great Brit ain American possessions is urged. He reoommends the modifications of the tariff and internal revenue the taxes from an internal source to be abolished, except on liquors and tobacco; these to be subjected to a stamp amy. uur ro latinm with'foreien countries is dis- fuaapd. A commission has been ap- nninted to adiudicate the claims of Americans against Spain, and the hope is expressed that the commission will be successful. The visit of the Grand DukeAlexi8 is referred to as an evi dence of the continued friendly relations with Russia. The inexcusable conduct of the Russian Minister renders his dis missal a matter of duty, for his per sonal abuse of a Government odicer and his persistent interference in the af fairs hotween this and other countries. IJis place has been filled by a gentleman , . i.t '- WHO IS not oujecuuuuoic w mm uutuh moot. Our relations with Japan are amica ble, as also with all the eastern coun tries. The difficulty w:th Corea is re ferred to Congrcjs. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the tree entry ( ?) law, and the hope is expressed that Mexico will soon adopt measures to stop the lawlessness on the border.- Congress is urged to press the claims for the over-due awards of the Venezu ela government for IHdG. The relations with Brazil will be more Cordial since the decree of emancipation by that country, and regret is expressed that Spain has not followed in the same direction in her possessions. It is to be egretted that the disturbed condition ot Cuba is a source ot annoyance ana anxiety. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of American citizens and maintain the aignity oi our nag. The national debt has been reduced $HG,0iJ,12G SO during the year, and now the interest accrued is nearly I7,UtH),uuu less than on the first of March, 1HG9, but it is not desirable that the present re sources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. 1 recommend that all taxes lor interest from internal sources be abolished, except those for Bpiritn ous, vinous and malt liquors and to bacco in its various forms. The use of stamps in readjusting the tariff on arti cles not produced at home is recom mended for the free list, and in case of a further reduction, it should be upon arti cles which can best bear it without dis turbing home productions. The present laws for the collection of taxes, with small salaries for collectors, induces fraud, and should lie remedied under the act of March 3, 1S0S. Each grade in the staff corps should be fixed in order to enable vacancies to be filled from the same grade. The navy is in an eflicient condition, without increase or cost of maintain ing it. The union of the postal and telegraph system is recommended. Education is urged as the ground-work of republican institutions. Tbe Ku Klux laws have ben en forced in a portion of South Carolina, and the necessity is shown by the com mittee to investigate Southern outrages. The power was exercised reluctanly, but a careful examination proved the ex istence of powerful combinations to de prive the emancipated class of the sub stantial benefit of freedom, and pre venting the free political actions of those who did not sympathize with their views. The details are given of these outrages. In Utah, a remnant of barbarism, re pugnant to civilization, to deiency and to the law, still exists. It is not with the religion of the Saints that we dal, hut with their practices. They will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. In future legislation the statutes of a plurality of wives and children must be considered, and an act nnuht be made to legitimatize all children born prior to the time fixed in the act. The Indian policy has resulted favor ably, and many tribes have been induced to settle upon reservations. The pn e policy is recommended, beenit.e it is right. The retention of land for iittuul settlers is again recommended. As six years have elapsed sinro tin close of the war, it may be eonxidi-rtd whether it is not now time the diriiliili ties imposed by the Fourteenth Ain-nd ment should be removed. When pnrit;, of the ballot is secured, majori ties are sure to elect ofliocr.i ie fleeting the views of the majority. I do not see the advantage or propriety rd excluding men from office merely be cause they were, before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those enter taining precisely the same views but of less standing in their community. It may be said the former violated an oath, while the latter did not hare it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted that they would have broken it, as did the former class. If there are any great criminals, distin guiahed above all others for the part they took in opposition to the Govern ment, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be excluded Irom such an am nesty. The condition of the South is not anch as all patriotic citizens can desire. It will bv a happy condi tion of the country when the old citizens of the Southern States will take an in terest in public attain and tolerate the same freedom of expression and ballot as those entertaining different opinions. A liberal appropriation is recom mended for the District of Columbia, to aid local improvements. The erection of public buildings in Oi.it ago is urged, and laws to protect emiirranU are suceested. The Administration has sought to e care honest officials, aid if any dis honest ones have appeared it is the fault of the system of snaking appointment.

The follow ing particulars, furnished to our reporter by an eye-wttnost , may be rci.ea upon a true : When the down train came near one of the station on the road it was run ning at full speed in order to make up time, as it was a few minutes behind. The road at this point runs through a cut something more than a mile in length, and in entering it the road makes a curve, so that the engineer cannot see eutirely through it, lie had hardly got ten into the cut before he saw a woman riding leisurely through it, using the center of the track. She was not more than half way through the cut, and barely a quarter of a milo ahoad of him. lie immediately whistled "down brakes," and then sounded the warning. The woman, hearing tho peculiar death-whistle of the locomotive, looked around and saw tho train rushing at her. She did not shriek, nor faint, nor (rive no all hone, but, like a true web foot, her courage rose equal to the efner cen'ev. and without a moment's hesita tion she commenced swinging her rid-iuir-whiD from one shoulder of her steed to the other, thereby urging him to exert bis utmost speed. The shrieking of the locomotive's whistle caused the passengers to lookout of the windows, and upon their discov erinir what was the matter the wildest excitement ensued. Several jumped forward and seized the bell-rope and commenced pulling on it, as if they could stop the train by that means. 1 be brakemen were exerting all their strength on the brakes, and the engineer had cut off the connection and was do ing all that he knew to stop the train, while the woman was doing her level best to urgo that bit of horseflesh to speed; but all in vain. The loco motive kept gaining on the horse and its rider, and there was scarce ly a person on the train who did not expect that both the woman and horse would be killed. There was per haps thirty feet intervening between tbe cow-catcher and the horse's heels when fortunately for the woman, she observed a place which was a little wider than usual, and with a steady rein she guided the fleeing horse from the track and en deavored to press against the wall of the cut in order that the train might pass by without injury, lu doing this the woman was encouraged by Sam Winans, the conductor, who had run forward and got on the locomotive. A few seconds only Dossed br when the fiery monster poked its nose past the rump of the horse. At, this moment Winans threw his whole force aeainst the animal and held him until the train stopped, and then a rons intr cheer of ratification and joy at the escape of the woman from a terrible death was given. .. A young woman named Sweet, who was employed as a domestic in the fam ily of Dr. Fairbanks, ot fuitoti, inu., died from the effects of innoculntion ith erysipelas poison on Monday of last week. She handled some cloths which had been used on an erysipelas abscess on Dr. Fairbank's arm, and allowed some of the virus to be absorbed into slight wounds in her hand. The poison communicated with her system, and al though all efforts known to surgical art were tried, she did not survive. 

SPECIAL NOTICES. Winter Wisdom. Warm clothinc albn will not protect the body arainst th eonse- quenees of the sudden depression of tempera ture which is concomitant of early winter, Flannel next the skin preserves th animal heat, but it does not Impart animal visor. That property is th special prerogative of Uottetter's rJ to uiach Bitters, which is there fore a eptcifie protection against a majority of the complaints which are most common at this season. For example, a course of tbe great vegetable lnvujorant, commenced now ill be almost sure to preclude chills and fever, bilious eolie, disorders of the stomach, constipation, and many other complaints which arc often the direct or indirect effect of an atmosphere surcharged with cold, un- wbolcsomo vaior. Moreover, the system toned and regulated by this means is much more likely to resist pulmonary disease than it would otherwise be; for the influeneeof searching medicine pervades all th organs, and every fibre and tissue of the frame. Per sons whos vital powers ar weak, especially invalid ladies and the aged, are earnestly recommended not to face tbe winter's rigor without having recourse to this safe and suf ficient moans of re-enforcing enfeebled na ture. Much suffering may be escaped, mneh danger averted, by following this council, Better late than never, is a good proverb, but it is better to be early than lata.
