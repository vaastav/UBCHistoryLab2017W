&S,'«?•'. W••:•'. :..' -J- KHSOBS COORTY RECORD BV D. R. STREETS Linton, North Dakota. PIONEER PAPER OF THE COUNTY. The Becord Is entered ftt tbe Linton Post offlce as second-class matter. ANY reasonabe, sensible person- belie a farmer, a local business mail or a railway stockholder—knows lliat the interests of the common carriers and the shippers arc something thai should be treated from a standpoint of what President, Roosevelt has made noted as "A Square Deal." The peo ple of North Dakota need the rail roads and the railroads need the people. The public burdens should be borne in a fair and equal proportion by each. The man who seeks to stir up opposition to railway corporations because they are corporations is a demagogue in every sense of the word. But railway companies have privi leges that the public is compelled to (five to them by virtue of the law of eminent domain, which authorizes railways to take private property fur their own use. Having such privi leges, a railway company should not forget the duties it owes to the pub lic. It should strive to Kive the peo ple along the line ot its road "A Square Deal" in every sense of the word. Perhaps no ranker application of the Old Vandcrbiltian proposition of "The public be damned" has been made In any state than has been made—and is now being made—by the Northern Pacific Railway in its treatment of the people living along the line of its Linton-McK.uu7.ie brand). From the very lirst there has been no attempt whatever to ac commodate the people dependent upon the Linton N. P. line. Every move made by the company in running or attempt ing to run trains on this line has been in utter contempt of state laws and of the rights of the people. An old plug of an engine that should have been condemned years ago has been per sistently used for hauling the mixed train between Bismarck and Linton, Not even have the authorities of the road condescended to establish regu lar times for the arrival and depart ure of the train. People, have been compelled to wait for hours around the depots for fear they would be left wbon the train started. No atten tion whatever has been paid to the public convenience in tyiis respect. But the worst deal of all has been the one the people along the line have gotten since the snow-storm. Last Friday a snow-plow came ihrough from McKenzie to Linton, opening the road. As Friday was the regular day for a train to come from Bismarck to Linton, everybody expected to see old Scrap-iron Bill and a few cais moseying along behind the plow. But became not. Then it was believed that a train would surely come Satur day, as the round trip could easily be made in a day or the train could come on Saturday and go back Sim day. But those who 90 thought were doomed to disappointment. None came Sunday. None came Monday. None came Tuesday. ... ®i a:-':' Now, mind you, from the hour of the passage of the suow-plow there was not a time when an engine—not the pile of scrap-iron that disgraces the company as well as the country through which it runs, but an able bodied locomotive—could not have made the trip. It should not be forgotten, too, that during all this time a car-load of kerosene was 011 the way—supposedly at'Mcltenzie—waiting for the train to Hazelton and Linton, in Linton and in Hazelton not only were the resi dents out of kerosene, but they were likewise without lignite and bitu minous coal, and only a few of the stoves used by them are suited to the use of hard coal. But the authorities of the company seemed to care nothing for these con ditions. The people might use tallow dips and go to h—1—or to bed—to keep warm. That was a matter entirely inconsequential to the company olli cers. Then had plenty ol light and fuel. Here in Linton a number of pas sengers were kept waiting—some of them immigrants with many chil dren, and with farm live stock—wait ing the pleasure of the N. P. author ities in sending a train over a road that had already been cleared of snow. But the days passed by and 110 train came. "The public be damned!" said the official# of the company, in deeds, if not in words. And these outrages, mind you, were committed by a corporation that has a legal right to cut your farm in twain whether you will it so or not. But, before you grind your teeth, more or less gentle reader—while read ing this by your tallow dip—before you anathematize railroads as rail toads—let us look at another picture. 1 The "Milwaukee" railway, notwith standing the storm, did not miss a •single train between Aberdeen and Linton. Every day a passenger train came in and went Out three times the tri-weekiy freight train arrived and three times it departed. The trains on this road were our only medium of communication with the outside world. M- Evidently the .Authorities of the "Milwaukee*' company do hot ran 'v, ... their tralaa on a scihedfile of Tba Pift lie be Damoed. It any one complains to the N. P. authorities in regard to the running of this exasperating jerkwater outfit between Linton and the Capital City, you will be told that the branch doesn't pay: that it was a very ex pensive piece of road to build, etc., etc. But, when these things are told to you, don't, let it escape your mem ory that when yon gave the company rigld-of-way over your farm you ex pected that trains would be run as tliey are usually run that some at tention would be paid to the comfort and convenience of the people along the line of I he road. r. Don't forget, too, that, while this particular branch may not p'iy at present, there are other business men who establish plants that they do not expect to make money out of right away. And don't, forget, also, that the N. 1'. system, as a whole, is a money maker- hat, its stock has in a few years I'oine up from a few cents to away above par that millions of acres of the public land—of your land—were given to the company that it might build a railway system that would serve the public. While we are receiving sucli treat ment from the Northern Pacific au thorities, thai company is hauling must of our fuel, all of our lumber and a good part of our wheat, besides a share of other freight. 11 is such treatment as the N. P. lias been giving us since its Linton McKenzie line was linished that is building up an 0rgar.i7.ed and de termined anti-railroad feeling in the L'niud Stales. There is neither sense nor reason in opposition to fair-deal ing with railroads but the railruads should tie made 10 do their duty, just as the law compels the individual to do his duly.

TIIJU Milwaukee Railway Company has at last begun work on its long talked-of Pacific coast extension from Evans, S. D. More than a hundred surveyors for the new trunk line are said to be at work west of the Missouri river. At a recent meeting of tile board of directors of the company the giant undertaking was authorized. lr always seems to happen that when the Dakotas get a big storm there is a bigger one somewhere else. While the snow-storm prevailed here, on the great lakes there was a tre mendous hurricane. Many lives.were lost by the wrecking of vessels. In the Dakotas there was not a single loss of life by the storm, so far as news has'come to hand. TJJK Bismarck Tribune man—who of late years has been one of the chief toadies to the Red River Valley pmhibby sent iment, criticises a Bis marck jury because it acquitted liquor-seller in the face of strong evi dence of his "guilt." Criticism of this sort comes with poor grace from an editor who is chief of a syndicate of Bismarck business and professional men that buys booze by the barrel. "Physician, heal (not heel) thyself.' IT makes the Record chap think of old times to see the newspapers of the county come out on wrapping-paper, half-sheets, etc. Time was when Merchant Conner, up at Billsport, kept a certain size of wrapping paper in order to provide against the edi tor's carelessness in failing to keep "storm cditioii" on hand. And what a large book the sinful thoughts— and remarks—of Bert of Braddock, and B.ert and Link of Hazelton, while waiting for their sriowed-lh bundles, would make. A FEW of the state newspapers in timate that there was "something back" of Mr. McGillivray'sresignation of the position of register'of the Bis marck land offlce, for the reason that Preslden Rousevelt .asked for said resignation. There was certainly no crookedness or there would have been something more than a request for resignation. The probable cause of the resignation was that McGillivray persistently neglected the. duties of his position, and the president, hear ing of iti requested bin ty- quit or be. kicked out». 4 TABdifectoiff little tin ot 'the- new evening paper at Grand Forks at once bought ^grammar and a spelling-book when the contracts with Editor Lampman had been duly sigued. t'l'HK Fargo :Searchlight,''published by Trovatten, the Scandinavian League sliouter for the Fargo bunch of capital-removers, says: "It would be a good tiling to move the capital from Bismarck, giving it to~either Fargo or Grand Forks, and the state rail' to the other city." The Search light and its disciples do not like National Committeeman McKenzie any better than they like the Missouri Slope, for the reason that McKenzie's ability as a political leader and or ganizer has been the means of getting and keeping a good many institutions for the Slope metropolis and have made the Slope a power in the politics of the state. And the Red River Valley capital-removal push may as well make up their mirids that the people of the counties tributary to Bismarck—ar.d especially of those counties through which rail roads have been built on their way to the Capital City—know in which di rection their interests lie. When re apportionment shall have taken place, the Red River bunch of alcohol-guz zling prohibbys won't be so much of a factor in the politics of the state. They stole the fair from Mandan, but they would And it a bigger under taking to move the capital to the Minnesota border. 

KNOWING the deep interest taken by newspaper readers in the subjects now in contention throughout the length and breadth of the nation, and knowing that all such subjects would be handled without gloves by Presi dent Roosevelt, the Record publisher thought it his duty, though at con siderable expense, to furnish his read ers promptly with the full text of the president's message, delivered to the congress day before yesterday. It is printed—every line of it—under appropriate sub-headings, in supple ment form, In this issue or the paper. It will prove to be acceptable reading Tor every American citizen who is in terested in the vital questions now at issue in this country—questions that have not been equaled in importance since the nation was in the throes of the anti-slavery struggle. The sub headings make it an easy task for the busy reader to pick out the para graphs of paramount interest, such as "Regulation of Trusts," "Railway Rate Question," "Square Deal for All," "Revision of Revenues," "Chi nese Immigration," "The Philip pines" and "The Panama Canal," md skip others of not so much gen eral importance, The message is a long one, but the president uses plain language, and there is no doubt as to the meaning of any of his paragraphs.

JASON WOOD. R. C. BURLING AME. Sack from Red Wing. Billy Jones returned Thursday of last week from Red Wing, Minn., where he was called by the death of Samuel Culbertson, his sister's hus band. Mrs. Culbertson died of cancer about a year and- a half before her husband's death. Billy brought back with him Mr. and Mrs. Culbertson's two orphan children, Milton, aged about thirteen years, and Florence, about eight years of age. The little ones will make their home with their grandmother, Mrs. Griffith Jones, and their uncles, William and Thomas. Another feature of Mr. Jones' trip has proved of great interest to the boys and girls of Linton. Mr. Cul bertson bad bought for his children f*pan of wee Shetland ponies. Mr. Jones was offered a fancy price for -them by a Red Wing banker but the disapproving looks of the children settled the proposition in the nega tive. So the little pets, averaging less than 400 pounds each, were put in crates and brought along in the express car to Linton. One of the ponies is a trick chap—stands 011 his hind feet, shakes hands, etc., and tries to steal apples and things like that from the boys and girls "of his acquaintance." The children seem to like their new home greatly. Will Return to God's Country. The Rev. John Wray, who recently left the nazelton neighborhood with his family and went to the Canadian Northwest, expecting to make his home there, will return. Following is part of a letter recently written by him to Editor Thurston, of the Hazel ton Republican, under date of "York town, Saskatchewan, Nov. 22,1905: "I came in last night from a trip of more than 200 miles to tile northwest of here. I enjoyed it immensely, saw lots of country and, more than all, I was perfectly satisfied that did not want any of it for a home. This country may be O. K., but not for me. Mrs. W. thinks the same way. So you can expect us back to Emmons county in the spring. No joking about it. I could not be satis fied here—and I have not been—since I came. I wish I could expaiiate to you for half an hour and describle the country but I will tell you all about it in the spring. The children have been on the sick list since we came. Grade is in bed now with the measles, and I suppose the others will get hem. Typhoid fever Is very preva lent here, oh account of the water, which, as Grade says, is 'rotten and hard.' It seems strange to me that every little town here has about a dozen collectors out night and day, and notes, mortgages and sheriff's seizures and sales are about as plenti ,fi»l as wind in North Dakota. Friers for everything are very high, averag ing 50 per cent more than down here-" IA 4 ... rM Linton Market Report.

On account of the storm, only twelve tickets were sold for the dance at the opera-house, Thanksgiving evening. But the dance went on just the same until the morning hours, and ail who attended say they had first-class Mine.

Tbe sad intelligence comes from Winona that Mrs. Wollmann, wife of Jacob Wollmann, an early settler hi that neighborhood, died on Thanks giving day. The deceased was well known and highly regarded by all who knew her. She left a babe about eight days old. The funeral took place last Saturday. The interment, we un derstand was made on the family homestead. Mr. Wollmann's many friends throughout the county extend stneere sympathy to him in his great affliction. Leonard Da Heaume took a man out in the snow storm, last week, and sold him a quarter-section of laud near Hazelton. Leonard told him the truth regarding the land, and in formed him that he -would take him up there to see all that could be seen of it through tbe snow that he could ask the people in -the neighborhood regarding it, and take their word for it. The stranger did so, bought the land, and secured a good quarter at not unreasonable price. It pays to tell tbe truth when selling land as well as in any other business. Mr. and Mrs. James Frederick came down from Hazelton Tuesday and took the Milwaukee train en route to Kansas City, where Mr. Frederick will be treated by a» eye specialist. He is looking well and is getting along very well with the exception of bis eyes, which more than any other part of him appear to be adversely affected by the stroke of paralysis that at tacked him several months ago The many friends of the big-hearted old timer hope that his trip to Kansas City may prove to be of great benefit to him. Eureka Blade, Nov. 30: F. A. Sher wood, of Dale, N. D., was in Eureka en route home. Mr. Sherwood shipped a train-load of cattle to Chicago about a month ago, and, after disposing of his stock went ons to his-old home in Ohio, near Cleveland, which he bad not visited for twelve years. Of course he found conditions much changed, but the most remarkable to him was the electric-car system of traveling in the old Buckeye state. Practically tbe entire state is a net work of electric-car lines, and one can go most anywhere any time on one uf these lines at small expense. It will probably be a long time be fore Mrs. Shier, wife ot tin sheriff makes another "pleasure trip" to Bis-" marck. A week ago Saturday she and her husband went to the Capital City. Mondky about 2 o'clock she went to the Bismarck depot., to return home, entered the car of the Emmons county flyer, and staid 'there until about 10o'clock at night, when it was announced that the train had been abandoned, owing: to the storm then raging Mr. Shier next day made the .trip down to the Shier ranch, at Gay ton, by stage, and it was a mighty tougb proposition to get through.
