Tan Session of the Council The city council last night held its first meeting since the 16th of No vember hut did not find a great deal to do even then, save to audit in accumulated heap of hills. Some spice was added to the last half hour of the session by the question of' the Injunction granted a few days ago upon petition of the W..P. & Y. R.. restraining the city from collect ing the taxes levied upon the road in the sum of $760. Mr. Ashley and Mr. Snyder were absent, so, when the question of hiring a ? lawyer to to make the fight, came to a vote and Shaw and Taylor declared they could not consistently vote for the contest in view of their attitude In the first instance, the "ayes" were but ree, Clark, Nye and Shea. The vote had been coupled with the name of Barnhill as the lawyer to be en gaged in the task. Then Shea want ed to get at the question direct ? whether there was to be a lawyer en gaged for the purpose at all or not? is the city to be sustained in its claim for the tax? Shaw declared it was not a question of the name of a lawyer but that he had opposed the assessment as unfair, he did not believe it could be collected, the levy being made without proof of value as It was. Shea asked if the vote would be the same If it was known ' that It would be without expense. Taylor said he could not see how it would be done without expense. Shea declined to explain what he meant for a time but finally said that he be lieved there were men in the city who would put up the money to test the question -as to whether the rail-' roud or thw people governed this town. "The railroad or the Home Power company, you mean," suggested Shaw He added that none of these con siderations had anything to do with his attitude. He did not believe the assessment had been properly made. Shea gave notice that four mem bers of the council, without regard to the action of the council, could en gage an attorney to make the con test . All this was introduoed by the reading of the notice of the courts restraining order. The bill of the W. P. & Y. for $408.35, for water also caused a slight commotion. It was set out that two pumps had been employed during October and for the nineteen days of November until the Home Power water was turned in. ?_ Shea declared that he was certain, though he could not prove it, that two pumps were not so employed. He Bald that the water from tho Home Power company pipes had been turned on Octobcr 25 and left turned on; that he and several others with him had gone the rounds and tested the pressure from tho north end of town. The bill would have to bo paid, he said, as there was no proof that the pumps had not been work ing, but there was no need of them and he was convinced they were not. Tho water had been turned on as a test of what was going on. The bill was ordered paid. The matter of allowing fire com pany No. 2 to go ahead with their contemplated improvements was turned over to the fire and water committee with power to act. Frank Frandson, secretary, and Mark Phelps, presented the case of the depart ment. An available cash balance of $4,115.36 was reported in the treas ury. The magistrate reported f 90 collec tions for the month. y How many times have you wished you had a recipe for mince meat that you knew would be good, and would equal the kind of pies your mother made \ Here is one that is vouched for, and used by the good New England cooksj 3 pounds lean meat, nftor it is boiled, 0 pounds apples ohopped fine chopped fine. 1 quart brandy :? pounds stoned raisins 1 toaspoonfoll mace 1 pounds Sultauo raisins I teaspoonfuU cinnamon .'I pounds currants 2 nutmegs prated 2} pounds best browu su^ar i teacupfull salt, swoetou with 1 quart cider ^ molasses } hS and keen in a stone crock In a Rind of c?o1 Plsce ft "ul? cldor and u little 2 pounds kidney beef suet chopped to chopp0d apples when u,ed for ple9, a powder If preferrod, 1 quart of boiled cider 1 pound citron may be substituted in place of brandy.
