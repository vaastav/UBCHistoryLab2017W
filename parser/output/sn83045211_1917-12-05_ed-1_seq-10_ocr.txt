'MM. .''Ovefj ttf'tj If : j- the fnotintalns and tho Adrlatlo ! ehort and the battle Is first of artillery nnd second of Jnfantry. Tho Italians have been re-enforced, but by guns rather than men, and tho guns are doing their work. Venctla is a quadranglo, three sides of which Italy had been defending. Now she has to defend but ono side, a far easier task, Germany Is nlso fighting a "Verdun" In front of Cambial, That city's lmportanco as a rallrond und distributing center has been destroyed, but now a sentimental value attaches to it, like that about tho ruined town on tho Mouse, lllndcnburg could not rcfuso battle on tho Scheldt after the English lunge. That would have been a confession of bankrupt morale. But this sanguinary countcr-orfenslvc, begun In wrath nnd cunttnued without legard of German lives, plays Into tho hands of tho Allies. Tho battle cannot be too much In tho open for us, as Is shown by the eager ness of tho American engineers to throw away their shovels and pelze rifle to aid tho.Itrltlsh. In casualties the Germans liavo suffered twice us much as the Allies ut Cambral, und the proportion Is evidently swinging hourly In our favor as tho waves of Teutons sweep on in vain. WHY NOT A REAL RKPUUMCAN? fpiIE Vnrcs are grooming rrnncl Sliunk -- Brown for the governorship. Anti-Pen-roso leaders, It is Ingenuously stated In n Washington dlvputch, say that In hlH thro years of olllcoholdlng the Attomey Gen eral has strengthened himself by appoint ments and today xtnndi us the strongest man tho Governor nnd his friends can put forth ns tho Vaic-Brumbaugh guberna torial heir. Aren't there enough good flepubllcans of btatcsmanliko caliber from whom to pick a nominee for the governorship of tho gieatest Ilepubllcau Stato In tho UnlonV Vurclsm Is not Republicanism, though one might think so from Philadelphia's election record. Tho rock ribbed Republicanism of Pennsylvania is not defined by Varo and Brumbaugh. It is defined by Lincoln and McKlnley. Tho protective tariff undor which tho Commonwealth has prospered, not tho Fifth Ward thuggery which has mado part of It a mock to men and a shame to genuine Republicans of Phila delphia that Is what Republicanism means to tho stalwart G, O. P. majority through out the State. Why should they bo asked by self-constituted Governor-makers to cast their ballots for a former Democrat, one tlmo political counsel of tho Varcs, grand son and namesako of Francis U. Shunk, Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, great-grandson of William Flndlay, former Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania and its rcpicscntatlvc In tho United States Sen ate? Ancestry and former party ulllanco might bo forgotten, but has Attorney Gen eral Brown's Republicanism yet won for him the highest olllco In the gift of tho State? Why not a real Republican? And why not belect him at open primaries, not handplck him In secret session of tho bosses? DISAFFECTED BLUECOATS IOYALTY to tho city, and not to the J Organization, will bo tho only thing that will prevent tho policemen from carry ing out their present Intentions to Rtrike. They havo no reason to be grateful to an Organisation which for a generation has sought to corrupt them, body nnd soul. Nothing whatever was done to Improve tho condition of the Philadelphia police until tho reform Administration uf 1911 was elected. Had the Blunkonburg-Porter poli cies been Indorsed by tho voters of 1015 tho first to gain would have been tho police men, who would never havo struck against u Porter leglme. Says tho leader of the disaffected police: Bvery policeman Is dissatisfied with tho treatment Iip 1ms received from JI.ior Smith and Director Wilson These two olllclals, If they had cared to do so, could have used their Influence to make the life, of every pollrcman a happy one. Unfortu nately, they liae failed to do so. This Is a very dangerous state of nffilrs. Discontented policemen do not make for a faithful guardianship of the peace nor are they apt to give their best endeavors to preventing crime. The morale of the force was badly hit by the hiring of New York thugs to do work In tho Fifth Ward that tho great majority of local otllmrs would havo scorned to do. Anarchy at tho top breeds anarchy all the way, through tho lanks nnd grades of subordinates. A staggering load of work Is piling up for the successor of Major Smith. Wlillo u British monitor can hit a bridge three yards wide ut a lunge of ten miles wo can feci that certain dreadnoughts will not get very far away from Kiel for tome time to come. Tho average pay of tho "salaried classes" falls short of that of tho trainmen, who are usklng for a -JO per cent Increase. Any salaried man can consider himself lucky If he has iccelvcd a 4 per cent rise In the last year, let alone 40. Tho President's address will be trans lated into every language and for all peo ples. Nations who havo so long nought to throw oft the Austrian yoko will have food for thought. Why whould they fight a Power which is fighting for them? This is the "long session" of Con gress. It Is quite possible that It will last until noon of March 4, 1319; and if all of those 13,467 measures up for considera tion aro discussed they will havo to put back the clock in tho last hour of debate. There should be no hesitancy .in ousting pro-Germans from Uncle Sam's employ. But we should be buro of our ground and Bear in mind that there are plotters always ready to uso the American flag as camouftago to cover deeds which will not bea'r tljo limelight. Food waste or saving In army camps Is largely matter of chance, as things havo gone. A company commander may have the luck to find a professional cook In the ranks to aid him, in which case there is marked economy, But without such aid offlcere aro rarely experienced in cull nary conservation.

PUBLIC ' COLONEL HOUSE: MYSTERY OR NOT?, President's Choice of Envoy for Intcr-Allicd Conference Clear to All but Senator Penrose SKN'ATOn PUNROSU has re-created the mystery of Colonel House Drawing his ample toga about his poitly form, tho senior rfprcwntntlvo of Pennsylvania roo In tho United States Senate, this week nnd ald: The action of tho President In sending Colonel House as the head of the American delegation to tho Intcr-AUIed Conference I look upon ns scandalous, l'.very other nation participating In that conference Kent Its Pmne Minister, while wo send a prlvoto citizen, of whom the country knows virtu ally nothing and who could not be regarded as anything but the President's prlv.ito representative. "Who Is Cfloncl House?" Is tho thundering Interrogation of Senator Penrose. Why Is Colonel House? is the corollary. People ruther got over nsklng theo questions In tho e-.irller years of President Wllon's ad ministration. Ila was .1 prlvato citizen, a mild-mannered mtn, small but sinewy, with n, countcnatico strong In Us assuranco of Intellectual capac ity but roftened by manlfcft Idealism. Tills prlvoto citizen appeared at the White House, was given long prlvato audiences, quietly left to pop Into the front-pnge news In con nection with some Important Investigation, agitation, movement or research. Ills reap pearance at tho White House was followed by Hxccutlvo proclamation or action In tho Important matter In hand. Warwick or Mark Hnnna Rumor mado hlin tho Warwick and tho Mark Hanna of the Administration. The President Is a man of bin own meditation nnd counsel. Colonel House Is a taciturn man, with a 100 per cnt b.llef In the old saw that silence Is golden and much loquac ity In a culpable neglect of Hooverlzlng tho dictionary. These quiet, self-contained men did not mako a mystery of their clocnern nnd harmony of relations, llut a mystery was mado for them, Presidents had often largely consulted' political chieftains. Hut it was something new for a President to havo an advisor from prlvato life. What did Colonel House want? What would the Presi dent glvo him? Wns ho tho "President maker" and was he tho "man behind" tho Piesldent? All tho occult paraphernalia of a Keller's magic chamber carefully erected by puzzled politicians, Washington correspondents and magazine Interviewers vanished in tho cool air of common sene. Colonel George Harvey's futllo grasp at tho distinction of Warwlcklng Mr, Wilson Into the White House dispelled forever tho Idea of u "President-maker." Tho Piesldent's Inde pendence soon showed that tho only "man behind" was his own Intellectual and spirit ual alter ego. Colonel House camo and went, mado his reports and gavo hla advice as a prlvato citizen always. His namo was not sent to tho Scnato for confirmation to any thing. The Heart of tho Mystery This, after all, was tho real mystery of Colonel House .1 man who worked hard and w antt-d nothing and It was a mystery merely to the seasoned politicians. The aver age person can very well understand dis interestedness, hut not the politician Colonel House must bo playing homo deep game for big stakes, it was argued. So tho first term turned Into the second and still ho remained high private. Tho mysteriousness of his personality and his relations to the President were long ago dispelled In the popular mind. It was obvious that tho President wanted a man who could hold his tonguo and his counsel, who had acumen, background and sympathy, to In vestigate unolllclally and confidentially mat ters on which an unbiased repoit was do blred. Colonel Houso was the man ; that was hla function. The President sent him to Europe In 1015 and 1910 for a close-up viow of matters of moment which affected Ameri can statecraft and which might gravely In fluence and even shape American policies. Ho saw Lloyd George, Asqulth, Kitchener, Polncare, liuthmiinu-IIollvv-cj, Vlviani. Von Jagow, Delcasse and Zlmmcrinann. Ha saw others not so looming but Important. Most of all, he studied popular attitudes and re actions. That was the kind of Information tho President wanted and which ho could ot get except from a sane, pati lotle, trusted, personal envoy. And that was the heart of the whole made up mystery: Colonel House was the personal envoy of the President, llbeial in tendency, but conservative In action, reliable, thorough ly American. That's ull theie was to It. Colonel lIoue is, of couise, jurtly t blamo fur the veil of the myatir om enve-op g Inm at tirst Ho was us mum as a clam. It vv.i.s believed by tomo students of mythology that he paid homago at the shrine of Harpoc rates, the god of letlccncu. He thought a lot, said little and wrought wisely. He had no press agent. Ho eeaicd to bo a injstery when he became a personage. Why Colonel House Is f All these things havo graveled Senator Penrose. So liu luvived tho "mystery" of Colonel House He did not understand what many persons had already taken Into their Intelligences. Colonel House's growth in knowledge of fundamental affairs In relation to the war, his Initiation Into the high coun cils of statesmanship, his complete sympathy with tho President, his high prestige accru ing from successful accomplishment of do mestic and foreign missions made him logical ly tho head of the 1'nlted States mission to tho great Inter-Allied War Confere'ice. Prestige, patriotism, power to think and do these were the grounds on which ho was chosen. Theso nre tho reasons that answer Senator Penrose's queries, "Who und why Is Colonel House?" Despite the Senator, Colonel House could be and was regarded as something more than the President's prl vate representative. He was sent to repre sent the United States He represented the United States faithfully and fiultfully. Ho does not say much about himself In "Who's Who" Udward Mandell Hnufte, discover, was btrn In Houston, Tex July 20, 1358. He was educated at the Hopkins Grammar School, New Haven, nnd Cornell University; his father was a planter and banker; he has been active In Dcmocratlo politics, but never a candidate for oitlco; he lives at Austin, Tex. One might say that he used to live at Austin, for since 1912 he has been living In Washington, New York, European capitals, wherever duty to his country called him. That's ull tho Information this quiet, 'af. fable, reticent man vouchsafes about him self. The country knows he Is trusted by Its great war President, That to the country In gufllclent answer to Senator Penrose's In terrogations. That und the fact that the country Is proud that a plain democrat, one of the people, can bo legitimately and safely ueltcted from the ranks of private citizen ship to represent a demccracy in the chan celleries of Europe and in the momentous delicacies of diplomacy which underlie and feed, like blood vessels, nerves, brawn and flbere. the unified Entente policy, which li ti win the war for world freedom.

WEDNESDAY, DEpfiMHER ' i i' i WORK THAT WINS A COMMISSION The Little Fellow Ditf Whatever Ho Was Told to Do and Made Good rplll'3 "little fellow" sought a commission. -L He had heard that the matter was not extremely dllllctilt If one had the phy siquo and brains, so he applied for admlCH'on to the (JUlccrs' Training Corps and was ac cepted, Ho had learned the manual of arms In a military school nnd ho knew tho movements up to "extended order," but ho found on his arrival at camp that there was a wliolo lot he didn't know about tho things which he had studied nnd that thcro wns a, lot moro to learn. The first week wns a bitter ono for the wotild-bo lieutenant. Ills feet were soro and his brain fagged Hn hid trudged for miles behind a company of six-footers, tho smallest man In the tonipany, and had crammed unceasingly nt tho close of the day. He needed help along practical lines nnd there were spme points In thoro 30-odd books of study whtcli could bo explained In a void, but he didn't know how to get the word. There !. a distinct line betwien tho innks and tho commanders, and tho "llltlo fellow" feared to step across He Could Drive Nails With several others he stood outsido of headquarters ono day, when tho captain ap pioaehed and asked who was a carpenter. Most of thoro In tho group miffed "I wonder If ), thinks vvo'ro common laborers?" whispered ono rooltl,-. who boasted of the dignity of his southern blood. The si lence was penetrating. Tho llttlo fellow recog nized opportunity and grasped It "I can drive nnlls, captain," no said, salut ing and stepping from tho group, "and I'm willing to t.uklo that carpenter Job" Tho captain asked tho little fellow's namo Jones, for tho purpose of this rtory-nnd described tho Job. It vias the erection of a small shelf In headquarters. The little fellow undertook the work und It was dono well. The captain was pleased und extended a helping hand. Hut the friendship lasted only two weeks, for nt tho end of that time tho captain was shifted Hut Jones's spirit had been buoved and he pushed on with renewed vigor. Then ono day ho was ordered to leport at the now cap tuln's olllcc- With some mltglvlngs lie went, fearful that his failure to keep In step with tlm six-footers on the laKt hlko was the cause. "Jones." said the cupt.iln, "wo need shelves around the alllc'cr' barracks. Can ou handlo tho job?" Did Jones decline? Ho did not "All right, pick out five men and stick to It until It's done Never mind about drill, III glvo you tho new points afterward" Again tho social line was crossed and again Jones mado good, but again It was short lived. On thu return from a week's trench warfare, which was as near tho teal thing as blank lartridges can bo, tho captain was transferred. Tho third compiny commander wns a lik able fellow. Iln hadn't been In camp a week before he discovered that tho Oovel nnvnt had neglected to provido him with a wi.tlng table. Jones was sought, and although ho had never built a table, ho tackled the Job und was successful. Another week passed und the llltlo Mlew was satisfied that ho was making good. The cnptaln encouraged him liicttum ho liked his sunny disposition and his willingness t do anything ho was told to do. Hut Captain Number 3 wns also transferred. The now commander was a strapping fel low, tnwerlng above sl felt and built 111 proportion His Idea ot' a melel olllcer was height and weight and ho had no time Ji,i the ltttlo fellow So It happened that with no moro carpenter Jobs lo bo dono Jones couldn't step acioss the barrier between the flies and tho shoulder straps and "call-dowm" were numerous. When His Fighting Blood Was Up lie wns musing ever these things ono day as he unrolled his pack on tho barrack floor l.esldo his cot when hn noticed that his shoes wiip (peeked with dust Ho left tho paek for a moment to than tho shoes when tho tookle who occupied the adjoining cot en tered. " He topped tho llttlo follow by exactly eight Inches and was pugilistic In his man ner "net this stuff off the floor'." he demanded "I want to open my pack" The little fellow shot hack, "In a minute. I'm busy," and continued shining his shoes Then the big fellow walked to tho open paek and kicked an article across tho room. Jines dropped his shoes nnd stepped for wnrd, lists doubled. "You big piker. Kick something else In mv pack nnd yen go back hum- without a commission'" "Going to use political Influence against me, iii!" shouted the big fellow In u luge, because coming frt m tho samo State he knew that tho "little fellow's" father wns prominent in polities "You better not try It!" "No ine said nnvthlng nbrut politics," dc. dared Jones, "but If you kick tint pick again I'll smash jour face and we'll both go homo for fighting The endil be the field hospital for ono of us " The big fellow grumbled and tho little fel low remal' ed defiant and llna'lj- won out. But another rookie, who was bent upon a commission by fair means or foul, heard the argument und left the room. That ifteinon Jones's "rlilo was cut and murdered before tho company on tho slight est provocation and endid with his being vdered to r""r to the c.i"Ihii tffr drill He was not a quitter; ho had swallowed hard all d.iv ; but be felt that ths nt! had come, with tho goal three weeks distant. "Jon-s" said the cintnlti "l'v about de cided to send sou homo. You're too In different nnd slovenly. Whnt have you to say?" Jones told him of those six-footers and of his work at nights, of his hard ap plication to everything military. "I understand h'n'-ever " su'd the cnptaln, breaking In on the recital, "that you are going to ue political Influence to havo a man rejected and tn further vour own ambitions." At last the truth was out. Won on His Own Hcok "That's a lie, a rotten dirty lie. nnd I can nrovt) it!" Jone-R falrlv shouted Tho cap tain didn't know that tho lltt'e fellow was there on "his own hook" nnd that his prominent father had refused to visit him lest politics bo attached to tho visit. Ho iVdn' Vnii- fi-n t "ijiare t rt nij the child" policy had been applied from child hood and that the llttlo fellow had gone Into the business world and succeed"!! on tho words of u father who might have helped fl-.Tv'a'1" but "'ho "sid ntad, "I nnds good on nothing, now you do the same." fmt tho caotaln noon lnniiil tnese things uii i-i inneiiiir blunt -" sitncth"" 'n-vinclng Aftor that tho little fel'ow pushed on un hampered and succeeded, llut when tho commissions arrive cme .of thne whose Averacos wore far helAw ills obtained a first, vvhlls he was a second lieutenant. Then It vva the "little fellow's" turn to smile. Ono after another the flrstR came to him und said: "I'm a llttlo nervous about this. I Bt more than l expected. I'm afraid t can't handle my Job. It's a, little big What'd you get?" This was his answer; "I got a second and I can hold my Job I'm not worried or ner vouil.
