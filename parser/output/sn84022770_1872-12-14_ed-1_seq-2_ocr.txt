The Chicago and Roslon calamities prove that there is abs >1 u.tely no mali i ial of «r.i btiildinj.9 can Ik' constructed, that is tin proof in a large conflagration: that while brick, stor.e and iron may resist an ordinary degre 'of lirat. tiiey cniinblc or fuse b -fore the tirev blasts of a great c«.r.l!a;r.'atioii as readily as tin- light wooden structures of a country village. Vntil some substance is dis covered that will withstand the ordeal, nil effort must necessarily in' directed towards perfecting tho modes ot preventing and ex tinguishing tires. This subjei-t is one in wliie'.i o-.ir citizens should feel a livtl.v inte rest. A steam lire engine is an absolute lues s-ity. I! steam can lio uscel to ael\ antagc in cities, it can In- intro duced with much more proiK-icty in towns, where the ntnnltor of expcriene-cil firemen is small ami wheTc muscle and skill can be put to a l etter use than working the i unips of a hand outline.

E very body must concede that the elangcr is great and the means available to lessen it. We trust that our contemporaries, who are or should lie the guardians of the public in terests. will agitate this matte r until the com munity is aroused to action. Where there is a will there is a way. and we have no fears bat that, with united effort means will be de vised to secure an efficient tire apparatus for our thriving town. Tire CASE OF WALLA-WALLA CVU NTV. - The case against Kiger and his sureties, intlie Stt jireme Court, bus attracted no little attention and continent. It was argued at length last Monday and Tuesday bv the attorneys on ei ther side. Hon. X. T. Caton appeared in be half of the county, and lion. 1!. 1,. Nharp stein for the defense. Both gentlemen api>car to have devoted much labor and research to the question at issue, since the trial in the lower court six mouths ago. The precedent in like cases in nearly every Slate in the Un ion has been obtained. It will lie remem bered that the bond of Kiger was declared defective and void in consequence of an in terpolation of the amount after it had been signed. The precedents afforded by nearly all the decisions referred to ajp -ar to war rant the belief that the legality of such change turns upon the question of assent of the parties signing the bond. Whatever may be the final decision of the ease, the people of Walla Walla county may feel assured that their cause has been fully and ably presented by Mr. Caton. 

RAILROAD MATTERS. —The Kaluma Beacon says that next year one hundred and sixty miles will be completed from the Missouri river to the Yellowstone at the mouth of the Powder river, and two hundred and eight miles from the Columbia, near the mouth of Snake river, to Pen d'Oreille Lake. From Kalama to mouth of Snake river, about three hundred miles, there is good river navigation including two railroad portages, and also Pen d'Oreille Lake and tributary river there is good navigation for one hundred and twenty miles—so that at the end of 1873. the company will have six hundred miles of steam com munication at each end of the line, with a gap of seven hundred miles to be completed. DEATH OR A pioneer Fleming, one of the first residents of Oregon City, and pub lisher of tIA» flr*t ftewspaper on the Coast, the Oregon Spectator, in ISM, recently died at that place. He was l»orn in Pennsylvania and was 77 yearn old. The Knterprise suggests the propriety of a monument to his memory, to be erected by the printers and pioneer res idents of the Coast. We second the proposi tion, and ho|»e the fraternity of Oregon will effect some kind of organization to secure un ity of action. iMBOvBjfEXT.—Mr. S. X. Cooper U engaged in enlarging his sash and dour factory, at Tumwater, and contemplates increasing his facilities for business until he can supply the demand of the whole Sound. With the best of machinery and skilled workmen, he turns out work eipia] if not superior to any on the Coast.

The company was organized in the city of New York some two years since, under the finan cial control eif Miss King, a wealthy re:.l estate elealer of that city. A first clasa ship, the Mad no Demon st. has been fitted up and paid for. for the exclusive use of this compa ny. and is the first ship ever owiuel and em ployed by women in their commercial enter prises. It will lie re meinbered that Miss King visited tea-growing countries of China and Japan, spending nearly two years in the interior, often penetrating where no other American woman had ever been, and collect ing the purest tea used bv the natives. The editor of the New Northwest says that dur ing her rcevnt visit to New York she tnjoyeil several delightful drinks of this beverage at the headquarters of the company in the base ment of Madam Demurest'.", Emporium 011 liroadway, and can say truly that this tea far surpasses tho col union imported brands. The tine quality of this tea commends it to prae*- tieal 1 LSI re, and it is rapidly being introduced into every town and village in the Union. Madam Demurest, as I'resielent of the com pany, tvinevs an executive ability of no com mon order, and her financial intelligence is only equalled by her ingenuity of taste as queen of fashion and design.

Soon as we ascertain the facts they shall l>c given. Until then, the demands of Mr. Hogue, or his organ, will avail him nought. If he is proven innocent, we will not only publish the card but make the amende honorable. The Courier appears to forget that this is our dispute, and that its paragraph, therefore, may very properly lie classed under the cap tion of this article. Zs~ An item is going the rounds of the Or egon press alsmt a ' sniping" expedition that occurred in this vicinity, a few weeks ago. In justice to our young men we will state that the "Smart Alecks" who held the sack and candle on the mud-flats, were carpet-baggers of a few months residence on the Coast.

OrsiEH TIIADF..— Quite an important trade is springing up with Portland in the side of oys ters and clams. Messrs. Hawk A Manning dispatch about fifty sacks of oysters each week and a proportionate supply of clams, and thus far they have been received at their destination in good order. Several other par ties also ship at intervals large quantities of these bivales to Kalama, Portland, Vancou ver and other places, and the demand has steadily increased from the time transporta tion was rendered possible by the comple tion of the railroad to Tenino. Oy The Express remarks that besides being the favored rival in terminus expectations, Tacoma owns more steamboat property than any other port on the Sound, viz., steamers North Pacific, Alida and Black Diamond. The public school under the superintendence of M iss Jaunic Torrence, has twenty scholars; and the Good Templars Bodge is well kept up by thirty attending members of the order. Tacoma baing the natural outlet of the Puv allnp Valley, makes in one of the busiest lit tle town on the soun I. and her people should 1M- prosjicrious and contented. RETIHEJIIINT OE JUDGE NEUMW.—A Washing ton dispatch of the 3d inst., says that Associ ate Justice Nelson, of the Supremo Court of tliu United States had tendered his resigna tion. Judge Nelson is over 80 years of age, and his last ollieial act was signing the Treaty of Washington, in the negotiation of which he participated as one of tho high commis sioners. The law provides that a Judge may retire, if he desires, upon reaching the ago of 70, or alter ten years of service. The Presi dent has appointed Hon. Ward Hunt to the vacancy. DEATH OF FKED FINCH.—It is with profound regret we announce the death of Fred Finch, in San Francisco, on the stli inst. Fred was a young man of more than ordinary promise, and being the only son of wealthy parents, possessed unlimited means for a life of use fulness and honor. His habits and conduct were exemplary, and his friendship for his associates steadfast and true. Although Ins death was not altogether unexpected, it has cast a gloom over the spirits of his friends in the community which knew him so well. RUNAWAY.—Tho horses attached to a carriage, returning from tho funeral of Rev. Mr. Dicky's little child, last Saturday, became frightened and uninanagable, and ran the vehicle against a tree. The tongue broke, and the horses in (Kissing the carrige in ad vance of them, overturned it and started the other team. Alter proceeding some distance both teams stoppedof their own accord and were led to town. The parties in the carriages sustained several bruises and scratches, but were liott-eriously injured. I. OSS BY THE OBEQON CITV FIBE.— The loss by the burning of the Oregon City woolen mills is not as large as at tirst reported. It has Iteen ascertained that the lost on the building was $19,625; on machinery 981,069, and on wool, §58,343—a total of $159,040. There was an insurance on the building $11,625; on ma chinery, $27,125, and on wool $38,950—a total of $77,500. This reduces the loss sustained by the company to $31,530.
