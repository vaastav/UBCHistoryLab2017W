The attitude or the pollrc who niada no attempt to snpprntva the movement Indicated that their gym pathies or the Rympathlos of their superior were with the people as against utro who has s > lonf rulod Venezuela with an iron hand not troubling himself to conceal It in a velvet glove The trouble began early In the morn ing Knots of men Assembled In the PUfa Bolivar nnd the streets Leading hereto tllscuMing tho cituatioti There was apparently no prearranged plan hut the group kept continually augment ing Men coming in from tSre country joined the crowd which assumed very i Lirge proportions I At first ths people contented fiemsehci with marching up and down tho main streets shouting Down with Castro and applying to him the various uncom plimentary epithets In which the Spanish tongue abounds Then some craters made fiery speeches against the dictator and tyrant as they called him and the crowd began to manifest a desire to vent Its Indignation otherwise than in words Acting upon a hint that quickly spread detachments rushed In various directions and raidd the clubhouses cafes and evwy other place whore It waa known statues or pictures ot Castro were dis played These war seized sometimes in fooa of feeble remonstrances and carried to tho centre of tho Plaza Boll vat where all were plied in a hoap and a bonfire WAS started Others of the crowd attacked the o s of t the Venezuelan txjttery Com PJiijV5TMeh fa T ry profitable Govern ment monopoly and Jo o fow minutes the j laoe was an utter wreck Ml the lottery tickets that xrero found were I deStrot9d 0 Theb the crowd turned Its attention to the offices of the Conttitucionol the n Wp p r organ stlbsldlzel not owned by Castro against which popular feeling waa very bitter not only because of Ita support of the Presidents acts hut also because of Saturdays rioting in front of the building which resulted In tho wounding of a number of persons The mob entered the offices drove out the employees and smashed everything pos sible including the printing presses Offices store and warehouses belong ing to Castros closest friends and sup porters were next attacked and when the n ob finished with them they looked as though a tornado had swept through them Hitherto those having the friend ship and backing of Castro hive carried things with a high band but in faro of ttie wildly Indignant mob tbey made llftle If any attempt to save their prop erty Among other thinga that excited tho Met the crowd were the inscriptions on som Of the public buildings reciting GUtroo patriotism and the benefit he bad conferred on tho country These were quickly destroyed with hammers and chisel or paint brushes For sites II Ten hours the mob was in full o ntrol and nothing was done by the ftutborittea to restore order Ultimately aotteff President Gomez issued a man festo ordering thIS rioters to disperse calling oiit troops to enforce the order The manlfestantu displayed no d e1f to join Issue with the soldiers and when they appeared the mob slowly and quietly dispersed The most significant part of the whole affair is that throughout all the disorder tber was no display of animosity against Holland whose worships have seized two Venezuelan Government vessels and are ear hlng for others This is indicative of the popular feeling that tho dispute with Holland is due to Castros arrogant attitude In fact there is little general feeling against foreigners of any nation allty despite the knowledge that Vene zuela is diplomatically cut off from com munication with several of tho Powers Castro Is blamed for th ruptures with these nations and there Is little doubt entertained by impartial oBservers that his rule will soon end cither by proclama tion Of revolution There is a general feeling unrest everywhere and further disturbances would surprise no one It is stated here with what truth Is not known that tho Government Is not keep Ing Castro informed of the progress of events

regarded as a gratu itous personal offence in a manner consistent sistent with tho dignity of the highest legislative body in tho United States Action of an uncompromising character was indlcatoJ by tho course adopted by the leaders and followers of both parties In the Senate In putting tho order of re drafts In the hands of Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island recognizing him In tills instance not
