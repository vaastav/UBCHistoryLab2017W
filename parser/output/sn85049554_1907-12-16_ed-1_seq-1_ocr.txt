($k« zHt&i Old Point Comfort, Va., Dec. 16.— The backbone of the American navy, sixteen /first class battleships, under command of Bear Admiral Robley D. Evans, set sail today for the Pacific ocean, a 14,000 mile cruise which has set all the world talking. Parading In review before the pres Ident of the United States and saluting as tbey went, the stately white vessels drew anchors from th4-'rendezvous in •v Hampton Roads and steamed out of the famous old Virginia capes at a speed of ten knots per hour, headed for the eastern end of the West Indies. 1 four admirals and the sixteen commanding officers who arts taking the ships thru the Magellan strait to San Francisco. At the conclusion of the meeting on the Mayflower's quarter deck the presi dent shook eafch office* cordially by the N hand and as they went over the side he bade thean an officat adieu. Then jfor the journey of nearly ten miles, this president, as commander-in-chief of the American axmy and navy, led the long line of battleships out to Chesa peake bay. They followed his flag to Thimble shoal light, just five miles Inside the capes, where the Mayflower turned aside and dropped her anchors for the formal review. Each Ship Booms a Farewell. As a naval pageant, the review and departure was notable In American history. There have been several presidential reviews of the Atlantic fleet during the past eighteen months, but In those instances the great ships "were lying docile at the end of spread ing anchor chains while the reviewing yacht passed up and down their lines. Today the fleet was under way and jiad dast off from shore and was out ward bound on a cruilpe, which as the president himself expressed it: "No fleet of such size haB ever before un dertaken." Most of the big guns which had voiced 'a welcome to the president, upon his arrival in Hampton Roads, uttered a good bye tribute as they passed the Mayflower outward bound. The salute of welcome had been paid in unison the farewell trib ute was in the individual offering from each one of the sixteen ships. The fleet passed out in single col umn, the big government built Con necticut, ythe flagship Admiral Evans, pleading the way. Vessels were four hundred yards ikpart and from the Connecticut to the Kentucky, which brought up the rear, the line reached a distance of more .*• than four miles'. Five stageB of Amer ..lean battleship construction were rep resented.ln the line, and as an object lesson in the growth of the American navy the spectacle found one of Its most striking features. A large Eiumber of yachts £nd ex g^fcursion boats accompanied the fleet fi^down the bay and gathered at the re ^viewing round. President Roosevelt's '^'party on the Mayflower, included Mrs. Roosevelt, Ethel Roosevelt, Secretary Vr gof the Navy and Mrs. Metcalf, Asslst 4'^ant Secretary of the Navy and Mrs. S}* Newberry, Rear Admiral and Mrs. f" Brownson, Rear Admiral and Mrs. £C'"W.$2 x. -3 and Lieutenant Commander and Mrs. Siinms. The navai dispatch boat Dolphin -also »ame down from !*•, "Washington With a party of congress men on board. The weather was beau t'ful and conditions for the departure ,' of the fleet could not have be.en. much Improved upon. The Mayflower swung around the water battery of Fortress Monroe and into Hampton Roads shortly after 8. The saluting guns of the army posi were the first to signal the arrival -ot the' president and his party. Twen ty-one times the cannon voiced their notes of welcome. The yacht kept si lently on her way, accepting the sal ute as her due and as requiring no out ward form of recognition. Aboard the sixteen warships at anchor a mile fur ther up the roads, the bugles had al ready begun to summon the officers and crews to quarters. Most of the men aboard the vessels had been called several-times in the past to welcome the president, but there was special significance in today's ceremony. It was not time simply to look pretty on parade, but coupled with it was the note of "Good bye and good luck," which they felt had a world of mean ing to it.. President Wishes Fleet Gocd Luck. It wjIs not until the Mayflower had nearly reached Old Point pier that the president had his first (view of the splendid fleet. On either side the ver itable marine boulevard' of iships were disposed in two long lines, the flag ship Connecticut and the Minnesota standing respectively at th3 head of the shore and outbound columns. The other ships paired on opposite sides reached fully two miles away. Each ship was gaily dressed from jackstaff to flagpoint, leaving lines of varl-col ored bits of signal bunting fluttering in the breeze. The Mayflower entered the warship lane, proceeding slowly to a point about midway- of the assembled fleet, and let go her anchors. No sooner had she done so than the torpedo launch of the Connedtlcut. with Ad miral' Evans and his staff on board,' was swiftly to her side. Making after the gangway, the officers, in all the regalia of special full dress uniform, repaired on board the yacht to pay their respects to the president. He received them on the qaarter deck and the exchange of greetings was more hearty than formal. Following the Connecticut's lead launches from all other ships soon were swarming about th* Mayftower. Each admiral was accompanied by his staff. The captains commanding the sixteen ships followed the flag offi cers of the Mayflower, and with their arrival the reception reached Its cli max. The ceremonies were few and within a half hour after Admiral Evans had first stepped abroad the Mayflower the officers were returning to their ships. Get Under Way. The last good, byes had been said and the president's last wishes for good luck had been uttered. Suddenly the signal yards of the Connecticut flashed the message: "Get under way immediately, follow ing the motions on the flagship." The orders were volleyed trom each ves sel's. bridge. They were conveyed by warning bells to the engine rooms and soon the ships were robbed of gala at tire. Everything was in cruising trim, now that the time for play was past. With the departure of the fleet, the Mayflower proceeded to her place at the head of the formidable column and led the way to the reviewing waters off Thimble Shoal light house, ten miles out in the Chesapeake bay. The Mayflower retreated down the war ship lane, each vessel as she passed manned to the rail with blue jackets, all of whom stood at attention. t, The President Cheers Flagship. The Mayflower got under way at 10 a. m., and headed for Horse Shoe to prepare for the review. The Dolphin and Yankton followed. The fleet be gan to move away from its anchor at 10:05. The ships were loudly cheered by the crowds on shore. The yacht Mayflower, the dispatch boat Dolphin and the torpedo boats Stringham and Tinsley anchored together off the tail of Horse Shoe. The, fleet passed in review of' the president, who was standing on the bridge of the May flower, at 11:15. As ihe Connecticut at the head of the lino, with Admiral Evans on the bridge, and the rails manned by 500 sailors flags and pen nants fluttering In the breeze, and tjie band playing a national anthem, swept grandly past the reviewers, she pre sented a picture whic'i fairly thrilled those who saw her, and set the pat riotic pulses beating in quickening rhythem. The president lifted his hat and the spontaneous cheer he voiced was quickly taken up by others in the party. Abreast of the presidential yacht, the Connecticut began her series of salutes. The men at the rails, at the word of command, raised their right hands to their caps and held them there until the Mayflower was cleared. On the forward bridge Captain Hugo Osterhaus and the fleot navigating of ficer came to attention with a flourish of swords. Admiral Evans and mem bers of his staff saluted similarly in turn from the after bridge, while the marine guard, with polished rifles, stood motionless at "present arms." The drums abroad the flagship were ruffling their tokens of respect, when at last came the strains of "Star Spangled Banner" floating across the waves. Just beyond the Mayflower 4 -i ,jh wy -,i I" .h/sl: :V V. p/ -rTu hr V* a. --i M~ A saluting cannon were brought into play and with twenty-one guns the flagship voiced her farewell message. A Fitting Honor. it was peculiarly fitting that the Connecticut should lead the greatest fleet ever sent from American shores. She is the product, from stem to stern, from keel plate to fighting top. of the American naval establishment. Designed at the navy department at Washington and built at the Brooklyn navy yard, the Connecticut represents the highest type of fighting machine the navy has ever known. Her size, measured by the water the great hull displa.ces and not by her carrying ca pacity, is registered at 16,000 tons. The energy of her twin reciprocating en gines Is rated at 16,500 horse power. Will Travel at Slow Speed* Following the Connecticut and sa luting In their turn, with bands play ing, drums ruffling and guns booming, came the Kansas, Vermont, Louisiana, Georgia, New Jersey, Rhode Island. Virginia, Minnesota, Ohio, Missouri, Maine, Alabama, Illinois, Kearsarge, and Kentucky. These were followed by the fleet of auxiliaries, the Culgoa and Glacie, supply ships, the Panther, repair ship and Yankton tender. When the echoes of the saluting can non of the Kentucky had died away across the waters, the Connecticut, at the head of the column four miles away, had almost yreached the capes and the history making journey had begun in earnest. Clearing the capes later, the Connecticut showed a way down the coast. It Is expected that at sea various maneuvers and different squadron formations will be tried, but the speed will always remain the same, ten knots per hour, unless some ship should have to exceed that limit temporarily to correct her position or carry out some order. At 12:05 the presidents yacht May flower started up the Chesapeake bay on its return to Washington. 

EVERY PORT ENTHUSIASTIC. PeopJ*. Keenly Awake to Importance of Pacific Squadron Movement. San Francisco, Dec. 16.—News of the departure of the battleship fleet, under command of Rear Admiral Evans for the Pacific, was received with enthusiastic demonstration at every port on the coast. Everywhere flags are flying, and the people from San Diego to Seattle are keenly awake to the Importance of the movements of the vessels. jr y, FRENCH INTERESTED Naval Officers Regard Cruise of Amer ican Battleship Squadron to Paoific, in Light of Professional Feat, as Surrounded by Almost Insurmount able Difficulties. (, Paris, Dec. 16.—French naval offi cers are Intensely interested In the cruise Of the American battleship squadron to the Pacific. As a profes sional feat, they regard It to be sur rounded by almost Insurmountable dif ficulties. Captain Faber, of the general staff, speaking today, said: "The Financial resources of America make the problem of coaling the fleet com paratively easy, but there are three great difficulties, first, to keep so many units togethep second, to provision and repair the ships in event of acci dent, and third, navigation of the Straits of Magellan by such an ar mada. If the cruise is -successfully accomplished, .and if, at its end, as the program contemplates, the vessels are able to engage in target practice, thus demonstrating their readiness to meet a hostile fleet, the whole world will take off its hat in admiration. This will be a demonstration of crews and ships of the American navy which will make even the English navy look to its laurels." ,, FISH HARRIMAN CASE -i. Former's Counsel. Declares Charter of Railroad Securities Company of New Jersey, Contains Germs of Monopoly In Worst Form. Chicago, Dec. 16.—Legal arguments in the case of Stuyvesant Fish against Edward H. Harriman, involving the matter of voting certain shares of stock at the postponed annual meet ing of stockholders of the Illinois Cen tral Railroad company, were contin ued today before Judge Ball, In the superior court. Edgar H. Farrar, coun sel for Fish, devoted his attention par ticularly to the railroad securities company of New Jersey, which holds the stock which Harriman wants to vote. Farrar urged that the charter of this corporation contains the power and germs of monopoly in its worst form. It was, he said, a company which spreads its wings over every state and territory in the union. He contended that such a corporation could not come into Illinois and own and vote stock in public service cor porations of this state, since to do so would be in conflict with the public policy laws of the state. Farrar had eighty-four law books on the table near him, and he quoted liberally from these volumes to fortify his position. Import Total $105,350,000. New York.

FOUR NEW CARDINALS Pope Also Recognizes Several Bishops In Secret Consistory at the Vatican ~Refern In Allocution to Persecution of the Catholic Church.

The pope delivered an allocution in which he made reference to the per secution of the redeemer, and said his churcl\, had been attacked from all sides, in'warfare open or dissimulated. The rights and laws of the church haVo been trampled on even by those who are said to safeguard them, and the impious and vulgar press had fought her even to the extent of dis turbing the public quiet. The pontiff cited the recent disorders in Italy and "disastrous propaganda In the bosom of Catholicism itself, which is being carried on by modernists who disdain pontifical authority and desire them selves authoritatively to sanction a new faith and new conscience."

Special to Times-Republican. Des Moines, Dec. 16.—The two class es of politicians have never been dis closed in more marked degree in this state than during the last few days in the discussion over the question of Cutnmins' candidacy for president. There are those who declare that Cum mins does not stand any chance what ever simply because the nomination will never be brought west. There are those who say that he stands just as good a show as any one yet mentioned because It is a free for all race. The real principle that underlies the question of the governor's chances is the question of the nature of the fight that will be made in the convention for the nomination. ,, ".J "Will the naming of the 'next presi dent be a contest between the naming of a progressive of the Roosevelt typo and a reactionary of the Fairbanks or Cannon type? Or will it be a contest to name the man who by reasons of his geographical location has a residence in a state that is doubtful and where greatest strength can be added, to the ticket for that reason?" This question was asked of a prom inent progressive and at once he an swered that it would be a fight be tween tlie nomination of a progressive and a reactionary. The name of the man who gave the reply need not be given for any progressive" would give the same answer. The same question was aJked of a standpatter and he at-once replied that presidential nominations are always the result of compromise more or less and tha* the party leaders always choose a man from a: doubtful state who will add the greatest strength to the party and that no radical man of any type can expect to be nominated Any standpatter would give the same reply. Progressives insist that the old ideas have suffered a great defeat in the last few years and that noe on has done more to that end than has the presi dent. They believe that the day is past forever when the party, or any party will name a candidate because he comes from some doubtful state or because of a manipulation of the old methods of political wire pulling. They declare that the country has reached a place where the principles of the candidate and not the geography of his residence will be the controling mat ter in his selection and for that rea son they see possibilities in the can didacy of Cummins for president. They are sure that in the end the stand patters and corporation interests will center their strength on some such man as Fairbanks, Cannon or Shaw and that the progressives will center their strength on some such man as Cummins, Taft or La Follette, and on that line the battle will be fought In the convention. Had Secretary Taft shown greater strength from the first it is more than likely that the candidacy of Governor Cummins would not at this time have been so strongly urged. It is be cause of a feeling that Taft cannot win that the friends of Governor Cum mins in other western states have been urging him to enter the race and it is their enthusiasm for him that is causing his name to be talked of at this time for the place. The publication by Senator Dolliver of the letter from Governor Cummins to Williard H. Torbett, of Dubuque, as defense for his statement in Council Bluffs that Cummins had given his written pledge not to be a candidate against Senator Allison, is reviving recollections as to the occurrences of that' year. The letter from Governor Cummins to Mr. Torbett was written in the spring of 1906. The legislature was in session that year and Governor Cum mins' announcement of his candidacy for governor was made during the ses sion of the legislature. Senator Dolli ver was a candidate for re-election. His campaign and that of the governor were at the same time and the gover nor distinctly stated that he favored Dolliver's re-election. Senator Alli son was hot a candidate at that time. The legislature which would elect him has not been chosen yet and the cam paign for the election of the legisla ture that will select the successor to Allison is hardly opened now and will not be for some months. When solicited to make a statement as to Dolliver's successor the governor stated in a public speech that he fa vored Dolliver's re-election. When so licited to make a statement as to Alli son he said it was preposterous and that he might just as well deny being a. candidate for president at that time. It will be recalled furthermore that the attention of the ^tate was centered on Dubuque county because of the fact that Fred Kretschmer, who was given the Dubuque county delegation of state treasurer on the understanding that he name a Cummina delegation sold out to Ed Hunter, manager for M?- 'MM: a SiftSISSfess T.-R.
