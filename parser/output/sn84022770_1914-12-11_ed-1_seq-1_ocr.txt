What bearing the de velopments of the week at the Cres cent well will have on these plans is not known, but those in touch with the situation believe that the various companies and Individuals will go right ahead with their work. The excitement which immediately preceded the uncapping of the Cres cent well has abated somewhat but the efforts of those preparing to test out the field have not abated in the slightest and under the cover Of this slackened excitement they have been more zealous than ever in seek ing leases and in arranging to drill wells. And it's such work as this that those who are anxious to see the field developed, want done. I During the past two weeks, the companies which propose to develop this field honestly and immediately have been steadily selling stock, 'while those in touch with the devel opments in the field report a steady 'flow of lumber and machinery from J the mills and the trains to the differ ent tracts where drilling is to start. ! A number of new companies are be ing organized, while property owners throughout the county report that several capitalists and private cor porations are seeking leases, offering 'attractive premiums for them and 'promising development within 30 days. Although at thei present time there are but three drills and derricks erected and operating, the Crescent, Globe and Pacific States, derrick erectors are in the field for a dozen different rigs and work has started on the erection of derricks for the [Crescent, Crescent Drillers, Home Oil company, and the Scatter Creek I while timber is being taken in foi 'the Tenlno-Little Rock, Tacoma, Stai and Utah companies, while the Ajai 'company says drilling will commence 'on its property. The Crescent com jpany is preparing to drill one more well, while the Crescent Drillers anc Scatter Creek announce plans to drill 'two wells each. Drilling rigs are on the way to the field from California, Calgary, Ohio land Montana. It is estimated b> 'drillers and field men who are arriv ing to take charge of the field opera jtlons of various companies that be tween 15 and 20 rigs will be avail able in the Olympia-Tenlno field foi well-sinking within the next 20 days, as numerous well-drilling contractor* will be shipping their equipment tc the field from older fields, in hope* 'of closing up a number of contract* Ito drill. Several rigs of this char 'acter are coming from Montana and ' California. The Pacific States company is now engaged in Installing a Standard rig at its well near Rochester, replacing jthe Star rig which was used in drill ing the hole to its present depth of 800 feet, which will be moved to a site along Lincoln creek, about a mile from the present well and over the line In Lewis county.

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11- 1914 00 FEET Of one LOST 10 CRESCENT WELL Work of Fishing it Out Starts Friday—Drillers Disappear And So Do Leases—Many Believe Attempt Made to Discredit Pioneer Company. Eighty-eight feet of casing, four joints, lie loose in the bottom of the Crescent well, obstructing further progress until it can be removed, and the work of "fishing" it out was started Friday under the direction of Emery C. Williamson. Seventeen hundred feet of casing was removed Wednesday and Thursday, and as each section came up it was dripping with "live" oil, according to those who were at the well at the time, indicating to their minds that there was plenty of the crude article in the hole. The obstruction in the well was discovered last Saturday but did not become generally known until Tuesday when Williamson told the story of its discovery and the sudden departure of Drillers McGowan and Home and announced he had wired for Howard Slocum, field superintendent and driller for the Scatter Creek company who went to Los Angeles last Saturday to buy drilling outfits, to return and take charge of the well. Whether some one deliberately sought to "plug" the Crescent well to dis credit it, making it impossible for other companies to sell stock and begin drilling on their leases and therefore lose them, thereby enabling any one back of such a scheme to grab the whole field, or whether the casing was lost by Driller McGowan while Williamson says he was drunk, William son does not know. He, however, expresses greater faith than ever in the well, because, as he puts it, "I saw the best showing of oil and gas come out of the well Monday evening that I have yet seen," and is confident that "nothing could have been put in the well that cannot be crowded to one side in the shale formation and be drilled by. "Just how or what has happened to the Crescent well I do not know," Williamson says. "I am very suspicious that a part of the casing has been broken off and to test that suspicion I am having the casing pulled out. This is being flone after conferring with an expert field sup erintendent here from Califronia. I am convinced of this: we have oil and we are going to prove it to the satisfaction of the most skeptical." The discovery of the condition of the Crescent well, at a time when everyone expected it to be soon "brought in" as a producer, has naturally caused a slump in the oil excitement hereabouts and everybody is waiting to see what will be done with it, hoping and believing that the obstruction can be speedily removed and the well "brought in." The work of clean ing out the cave-in and placing the new easing had proceeded to within about 100 feet of the bottom of the hold when the obstruction was dis covered. According to a statement Williamson gave a Tacoma newspaper Tues day, he went out to the well last Friday with a Seattle capitalist who was considering a plan to finance the Crescent! Drillers company, and on arriv ing there found Driller McGowan drunk'in the bunkhouse. Williamson "called" him severely, he says, and McGowan got mad. That day Williamson ordered the assistant driller, Horns, out to the well, and when the latter started the rig up Saturday nsoming he discovered something in the well and stopped. Sunday morning, Williamson continued, Jeff Canon of Tenino, vice president of the Crescent Oil company, took a telegram from Los Angeles for McGowan out to the well, the message saying McOowan's wife was dying. The driller left for the south on the next train. Home went on the job again Sunday, but soon quit and skipped. Later in the week William son got a telegram from McGowan from Los Angeles saying his wife was seriously ill and had been taken to a hospital there for an operation. The message said that McGowan would hurry back to take charge of the work at the well. Upon discovering the condition at the well, Williamson wired all the agents handling Crescent Drillers stock, of which McGowan was president and Home also an officer, to take It off the market. Some of the leases of the Drillers company have disappeared with McGowan, particularly one for a 400-acre tract adjoining the Crescent well, where this company intended to drill its first well, which he had mailed to his wife more than two weeks ago for her signature transferring them to the Drillers com pany and which had not been returned. "Whether Mac deliberately ruined the hole or while in a drunken condition shook off a piece of the casing, will probably never be known," Williamson says. "Home also appears to have either known something about the situation or to have lost his nerve, for he has left, too. "There are several things that must be considered in a deal like this. There are a large number of leases of some of the best land in the field held by various companies and these leases, with few exceptions, are time leases, that is the leaseholders have but 60 or 90 days in which to start drilling. Most of the companies holding them must rely to a very large extent upon stock sales to get funds for drilling. If the Crescent well can be blocked and discredited, it will mean that stock cannot be sold and that the leases will expire, and then the lease grabbers will get busy." Speaking to the people of Olympia relative to the situation at the well, Williamson said: "This is not a time when we should become excited or jump at con clusions in regard to our local oil situation. lam probably in closer touch with it than any one. I have Just as much faith in it as I had the day the well was uncapped. The Crescent well is full of oil and gas is breaking through daily. This well has been pronounced a real oil 'strike' by some of the best known oil experts, geologists and chemists of the country. Five miles away, Just east of Tenino, another strike has been made, show ing the same grade of oil and gas. The field is proved beyond the question of a doubt. The finding at the Hercules Bandstone quarry proves it. The oil in the Crescent well proves it. ''Never before have there been so many who believe in the Olympia- Tenino field. Oil men of wide experience are here and some of them have money to invest and they're investing it. Many rigs are coming in to help develop it. Development is what we started out for and we are getting it, and we will get the oil, too, no matter who quits. "I have wired for Howard Slocum. field superintendent for the Scatter Creek company and a widely experienced oil man, who went to Los Angeles to buy drilling outfits, to return and take charge of the well. Wit Slocum on the job, things will turn out all right. Discovery well is a real discovery well. It will produce oil and with that oil will come a new Olympia and Thurston county." For the first time in nine years the McCleary sawmill has closed down for 30 days' repairs. The mill was started on the sth day of July nine years ago, and since that time the crew has not been turned out of it , once for repairs or any kind of a shut 1 down. A little time off was some- ' ! times taken on account of lack of logs but otherwise the mill ran every day. In the nine years it has turned out some little amount of lumber, enough to build up a fair-sized city. How ever, the plant came to a point where It could not operate efficiently without repairs. • * • • O. Flanders of Bayfield, lowa, father of Mrs. D. A.

OIL is struck in SECOND "STRIKE" BY SMALL DRILL TAKEN AS PROOF OF FIELD. Oil has been discovered in a sec nd well in the Olympia-Tenino field. \ diamond drill exploring 011 the Property of the Hercules slandstone quarry has brought in oil, and while the bit is only down to a depth of 110 feet the oil showing is unusually heavy. It is a high grade parafllne base oil, almost identical with that ound in the Crescent well. This 'strike" is taken as absolutely proof that the Crescent well was not "s !t --ed." The discovery at the -quarry was made last Saturday afternoon when the muck sluice of the diamond drill forced oil to the surface. Since that time as depth is gained the oil Is showing stronger. It is live oil, com ing to the surface bubbling full of gas resembling a heavy foam. The find was made on No. 2 quarry just outside of Tenino on the Tacoma- Tenlno road. The drill is operating on top of the high sandstone bluff of the prairie. The drill brings up a core of slightly over an inch in dia meter and leaves bore of about an inch and a half. It is this bore that the oil is going through. Proves Location of Anticline. The location ,of the well is on a direct line with the Crescent well and Grand Mound, proving to the geolo gists that the anticline of the district strikes northeast and southwest. The rock dips slightly along the anticline Btrike, with a slight pitch to the northwest. The dip and pitch are both very slight. .The core of the diamond drill shows perfectly the stratification of the sedimentary ocks, their dip and thickness of each. This log will prove to be of mmense value to the oil drilling com panies in the field. The new find is controlled by the Parafflne Oil company of Tenino, a recently incorporated close corpora ion, with William McAithur, presi dent; S. W. Fenton, vice president, nd H. P. Sheel secretary. The drill was started several months ago by Mr. Scheel and his associates in an effort to prove the existence of oil in the field. When the Crescent company started active operations, however, the diamond was stopped, Mr. Scheel declaring that there appeared to be no reason why more than one company should risk money in the early exploration of the field. When the Crescent well was proved to hold oil, the Scheel people started their diamond drill, working to obtain a log of that sec tion. They have proved the existence of the oil. To Start Drilling. The company will immediately start a standard rig working in the field on the prairie below the sand stone bluff. This drill will be used In an effort to bring in a producing well. The company will drill a 15- Inch hole. The Paraffine Oil company has al ready several thousand acres of land under lease. These leases are all in iwhat are though to be oil-producing sections. The sandstone quarry is full of cracks and fissures, through which oil seepages have been found since the setting off of the "big blast" two years ago, when several million feet of stone were disturbed. The oil shows heavily all along these cracks and fissures, bubbling to the surface In streams in places." Published Continuously Fur 54Years 

WHOLE NUMBER 2,829. SAYS LESISLIIIBR 01 BUSINESS ENDED PRESIDENT TIMERS CONGRESS PLANS FOR SHORT' SESSION NOW ON. "Our program of legislation with regard to the regulation of business is now virtually com plete. It lias been put forth, as we intended, as a whole and leaves no conjecture as to what is to follow. The road at last lies clear and firm before busi ness. It is a road which it can travel without fear or embar rassment. It is the road to un grudged, unclouded success. In it every honest man, who be lieveß that the public interest is part of his own interest, may walk with perfect confidence." These words, spoken at the outset, formed the outstanding feature of the message delivered personally by President Wilson to the short ses sion of congress last Tuesday, taken by many to be a direct message to the business interests of the country and to mean that business may pro ceed secure in the knowledge that, if it shapes its affairs to existing laws, it will not find itself confronted by sudden changes results from new laws. The message was considerably longer than the president's usual ad dresses. In it be urged principally: Features of His Message. Establishment of a government owned merchant marine to provide means of distributing tbis nation's products to other countries, the gov ernment to withdraw when private capital found the venture profitable and attractive. Passage of bill granting greater self-government to Phllllplnea. Appropriations to chart country'* coasts, particularly those of Alaska. Legislation to unlock mineral wealth of West and waterpower< ot East outside public domain. Approval of senate of convention for safety at sea. Systematic re-organisation and re assembling of government depart ments, to promote greater efficiency and to effect considerable economy. He expressed regret that it had not been possible to frame proper rural credit legislation for the considera tion of this congress. Discusses National Defense. In discussing this nation's prepar edness for war, the president was quite emphatic. Admitting freely that this country cannot put into the field "a nation of men trained to arms" and adding that it would never be able to do so in times of peace, "so long as we retain our present political principles and institutions, ** he urged the development and strengthening of the national guard and closed his discussion of this fear ture of his message with the state ment: "Let there be no misconception. The country has been misinformed. We have not been negligent of na tional defense. We are not unmind ful of the great responsibility resting upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstance; and what la needed will be adequately done." The seating capacity of the First Presbyterian church was fully taxed, as usual, by the many people who at tended the annual memorial exer cises of the local lodge of Elks there Sunday afternoon. A particularly impressive program was given, the memorial address being delivered by Portland C. Hunt of the Seattle lodge and the eulogy by Charles B. Wood. • • • • Professor O. H.
