Iu tii» aspect desiru to reiterate th« revouimuudaiion contained iu my last two juruaI men sagea. iu favor of imposing specific instead of advalo rem duties on all iuipoi ted articles tv- wliich these cau le properly applied.

As an abstract proposition it may be admitted that advaioreui duties \wa.U, iu theory, bs tuo injst just aud equal, iiut ii' ih.' xperieii ui this and of all othei commercial uaUous has demonstrates that such dutie& cannot be assessed and collected wiihout great frauds upon the revenu then it is the part isdom to re sort to specific duties. Indeed, frooi tht. \cry nature cf ad valorem duty, this must be iiu result. Under it the inevitable consequeuce is that foreigu goods will bi entera at les^ than their true value. The Treasury wiil. therefore, iose the duty u the difference between their re*l aud fictitious value, aud to this extent we are ddfrnudvd. The temptations which ad valorem duties present to adisiion importer are irre-Utible. Ills objectirto pa^s his goods througii the Custom-Uouse at the very lowest valuation necessmy tosavn them from confisca tion. In this he too often succeeds, iu Mpite of ihe vig ilance of thereveuue otHcers. ileuce the resort to false invoice-*, ouu for the purchaser aud another for the Cus tom llouje. and to other expedient-* to defraud th* Goveinmeut. The hojieet importer proJuce his invoic to the collector, stating t«e actuul pries at which ne pnrchased the articles abroad. Not so with the dishon est importer and agent of the foreign ui^uut'acturer. A id here it may oe observed tLat s very largo propor tion oi iho mkuufactures impo ted f.om uoroad are continued tor ^ale to commission merchants who are mere agents empioyed by the inanufactuiers. In such case*' no actual »ale has been mails to tix their value.-— Theforeigu manutactursr, if he be dishonest, prepares au invoice of the *ods, uot at their actual value, but •tth*vnry lowest rate necessary to escape detectiou.— In this manner th 1 di^hoHe^t importer aud the foreign manufacturer enjoy adeeided advantage over the honest merchant. They are tnua enabled to undersell the fair trader, and drive him trim the inaike*. In fact the operation of this system ha* already driven from the parsnip «'f livuorahie commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchants, w^tose character, throughout the world, is the pride of our country. lue remedy for these oviU in to be found in specifn duties, ho far as this may be practicable. They dia pause with any inquiry at the Custom House into the actnu cost or value of the article, and it pays the pre cise amount ot dnty previously fixed by Uw. Iney pi^sent no temptation* to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by undrv.V.uatioD in a fcw cases, render themselves inde peodent. Sesides, specific dntiesb^st conform to the requisition In tlu- Constitution that "no preference shall be given by any insulation of commerce or revenue to the ports Of one Slate over those of another." Under our ad va lorem Mygteni such preferences are to some extent inpv itablc, aud complaints have often been made that the spirit of thin provision has been violated by a lower appraisement of the same articles at one port than at another. An impression strangely enough prevails to some ex tent that specific duties are necessarily protective du ties. Nothing can ho more fallacious. Great Britain glories in tr *e trade, and yet her whole revenue from Imports is ut the present moment co.lected uud^ra system of specie out ies. It is a striking fa t,inthi connection that, in the commercial treaty of the 2d oi' January, lS'X), between Franc.- and UnglHud, one of the articles provides that the ad valorem duties which It Imposes rthnli be- converted into specific duties within six nioii'.hs frou its date, and these to be aseertaiueu by making an average of the prices for six months previ ous to that time. The reve seof the proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue would be collected by merely converting the ad vr.lor^m duties of a tariff into equivalent specific dttti?-. To this exmit the revenue would be increased. ana in the same proportion the specific duty might be diminished. Sj«t ctlfo duties would secure to the American manu fictiirerthc inci!e)ital piotection to which he i* fairly entilted und^r a revenue tariff, and to tnis surely uo per sou would object.

The cisterns are nearly empty and the Trustees think it unsafe to open the institution until they are supplied. It is expected that the commis sioners will coinineuoe an irtesiau well im mediately.

Muscatine, Dec. 11,1860 What Fohney Think* op It.— Forty's paper, the Philadelphia Press, gives an able review, of the President's Message, and thus closes: "The sum and substance of this message, able as it is, amounts to a recommendation to the Southern States, who believe tnemselvcs to be aggrieved, to leave the Union, and an encouragement that, in .e event of their doing so, there is no authority to be found, Tlie True Reasons for Secession.

Miller 36,lli& [For tliv Journal.] The i» Ite- Present Crisis Who sponsible Friend Mahin:—In the Journal of Dec. 5th, I find an articlc headed ''Boo-IIoo." Knowing well what is meant, I feel disposed to notice its charges through your columns. The Black Republican triumph is not the cause of the present crisis, eh It did not destroy the confidence of ha the States of the confederacy, eh?. Personal Liberty Bills are not bills of Negro equality with the whites, eh The Black Republicans are not Abolition ists, eh Then who is responsible? Did not the Black Republican faction manage to bring about all this trouble in the last Presidential election Are they not, therefore, responsible? But, as this is no time for criminations or recriminations, I have thought proper to write i few lines in answer to the article above dluded to, and will try to give some hints as io the true position which he different parties now occupy. In or ler to do this, I will commence by saying that, in the Declaration Independence, a charge is made against the King of Great Britain that he has excited "domestic insurrections" amongst us—(of *hich charge England is not yet clear, if we may judge of their abolition emissaries imongst us.) On the 9th day of July, 1778, the patriots .ind heroes of the Revolution, in forming the irticles of confederation, in the first section of tne fourth article, say: "For the better to secure mutual friendship •ind intercourse atnon* the different States, :he free inhabitants of these States shall have Vee egress and ingress to and from any other State, and 3hull enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, and no restriction shall be made so as to prevent the i emoval of my property imported into any State from my other State." Was not here sjave property included in ommon with any other property On the 17th of September, 1787, those :ime patriotic heroes, in order to form a 'more perfect Union," adopted the Constitu tion of theUnited States, and therein describe! natters moit* definite, so that there might be no cavil or misunderstanding among tho citi zens, under the Constitution, in after times. In the second section of the first article, the Constitution provides that five negroes or slaves shall be counted equal to three citizens n making up the representation in Congress. The ninth section of the first article declares :hat Congress sUall not prohibit the import ition of slaves before the year 1808 but the •iame section declares that a duty of not more than ten dollars may be levied upon each slave imported, which makes the distinction /ery clear between those imported and those nigrating it makes it very plain tbat im ported persons were looked upon as property —otherwise, no duty could be levied upon them which could be collected by the United States from the importer of negroes. The second section of article fourth declares that, if a slave runs away from one State to mother, he shall be delivered up to the owner, on a claim being made by such owner, which learly indicates that, if a State neglects or refuses to deliver up such slave, as required by the Constitution of the United States, uch State so refusing or neglecting is liable for damages to the owner thereof for the value of such slave. The sixth article of the Constitution declares that "this Constitution shall be tho supreme aw of the land, and the Judges in every State hall be bound thereby, anything in the Con titution or laws of any State to the contrary lotw'ithstanding." If, then, the Constitution of the Unite 1 States is the supreme law of the land, and recognizes property in negiees, and the second section of the fourth article declares that "the citizens pf each State shall be entitled to all the privileges in the several States then, if the Constitution of the United States does recognize property in negroes, and recognizes the right of the citizens to own such property, then that right must be equal or universal among all citizens of the United States especially as the Judges of every Sta^e are bound to disregard any constitutional provis ion or law in any State to the contrary, whatsoever the same may be. This makes it very plain that there is no power given by the Constitution, in any manner, by which property in slaves can be abolished, and any attempt to do so, by any legislature or people of any State, is a violation of the Constitution of the United States, and a violation of the equal rights and tho sover eignty j{ tbe citizens under it, when soever and wheresoever the same may be, in any and all the States and Territories of the United States, so long as the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land. Therefore, instead of the people of the slaveholding States encroaching upon the people of the non-slaveholding States, all they ask is that the people of the Northern States shall maintain those rights equal and in com mon with themselves which George Washing ton had and enjoyed when he occupied the Presidential chair of the United States, and had sworn to support tbe Constitution of the United States nor do they desire that the people of the Northern States should be re quired to make any use of said rights, but that thay should preservp and defeud |^em in common with themselves, and hand them down to their posterity untarnished and un blemished as they were received from our fathers and grandfathers. This done, and secession will be heard of "nevermore— nevermore." But how eanlhis determination on the part of the people be made manifest, in order to bring about a general and universal reconcil iation on this question throughout thc United States, since the people of the Northern States, by a large majority of their votes, have decided that slavery must be restricted 11 must be conceded b) all reasonable men that, if slavery is constitutional, nothing but a subversion of the Constitution of thc United States can either restrict or eradicate it. The first section of the third article of the Constitution of the United States declares the idicial power lo be vested in the Supreme ourt of the Un ted States, and makes said Court the expounder of that instrument and the second section of article third extends the judicial power of said Court to all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Therefore, let the Supreme Court of the United States decide upon the "Lemmon slave case," which is now pending before them, and place that decision side by side with the "Drcd Scot" decision, and it will appear to every one, at a single gl since, that, under the Constitution of the United States, no State Constitation can be valid which has an abolition or slavery forbidding clause in it. Then let both houses of Congress pass res olution requesting the Presi.ientof the United States to issue a proclamation to all the people of tho United States, clearly showing what lias 'been decided by the Governnfont to be the true law on this question, and requesting the people to hold conventions in the different States and counties, for the purpose of con sidering the impending crisis before the coun try. Let thc members of Congress use their influence, also, and let the people discuss and pass sucji resolutions on the subjeet as will clear up the whole cause of our troubles, and will at the same lime enlighten the minds cf the people generally on this all-important and all-engrossing subject. Let the people know the trua state of the case let thc people know that this is not a question to be decided by any particular code of* morals or religion that it is a legally constitutional and political question, and that it must be decided by the law and the Con stitution of the United States, and you will soon find that there is patriotism enough among the American people to counteract all the baneful abolition sentiment now so furi ously engaged in its onslaught upon the rights of our Southern fellow-citizens, who have equal rights with ourselves. This done, and a Congressional interposition against servile amalgamation enforced (to which the South will at once agree), and this L-nion will st^nd more firm than ever hereto fore peace and harmony will prevail over the whole country, and, God being willing, will continue so forever. And to this I remain your Union-Republican friend, Jso. G. Stine. [For the Journal.] Political—Dissolution—Union. Mu. Mahix :—1 am told that the two let ters—the short expression Judge Hastings gave in his hasty opinion of dissolution,am! that of my brother on the same—were- read with consid-rable interest. They were not intended forthe public, and were given with out much consideration yet they are from two mer. of mature and soand jddgmect. It is a little surprising tutne that any man, or set of men ot sound judg:iont, should say that, becsuse "Iowa and oilier State," have passed laws "in violationthe Constitution," •r done anything else in violation of law, that that law, or Constitution is uuil aud void 1 Every thief in our land would rejoice to iiear judges go construing their res: rain ing laws. If we bad had an Executive, and s conn il at Washipg:on the past tweive years, with the force of a Justice anil hi n htable, we sl.onld have had less dissolution. It is lamentably true, tbat the thing is actu ally tumbling to pieces for want of a little binding force. Iu tho case of Booth, of Milwaukee, and the Oberlin case.-, the bro ken laws were mendtd—Ivd the Executive plaster applied—because a mail was l.kely to lose his property. Bat when, in the Sonth, our freemen have been "beaten with many stripes," cast into prison, hung tjp ty the neck, we see no Executive interference for the proteetion of life find liberty. I might go on with innumerable instance?, to show that our National verniaent has become a partial governmeut, bending to 'ias sustain slavery in all its demands, rather that freedom. How evn'ent tbis appears from every act and movement! In its Cabinet officers—in its Judiciary— in the awlul biased decisions of the Supreme Court—and in tbe Territories, in all the power of our Govern ment, it has leaned so far to sustain and spread^avery tbat it is at tbis d.y about to totter and pitch over into universal slavery. And unless w.* vote for their southern can didate for President they will tear the Govr erument in sunder, and curse the Constitu tion, and the compact of the Union, which onr fathers entered into. We might vote at our elections if we would vote for tbeir can didate I And nothing can be plainer proof ot their ••P practioed and attempted tyranny over tho free States than the things set forth in tho President's hut message. Tbe truth noif| up pears that the Demoorats are dissatisfied!, with our present Constitution, and the Presl ident proposes three distinct amendment-, ALL FOB TUB STKRNflTa AND 

SPUE 4 OF slavery, and nothing to sust&in, advance, and spread freedom. Is anything re wanted to prove that Demcciatic rule is biased, prejudiced and partial And yet two thirds of the population, industry, virtue, common education, strength aud power of the^nation, morally and politically, is in the Free States. Now, our reasonable dtmand is that we have two -1 i rds of the Cabin et, officiary, and acts of Congress, andbenefltsof our expendi tures, turned towards freedom. The North will, u itliey ever have done, eustaiu the Constitution, as it is. Yes, the "Fugitive slave part and all," as my brother says be will. Strange doctrine from a Black Repub lican, s me Demoorats will say. We propose to sustain aFugitive Slave law, and not the Foglttve Slave law, as it is now in most pal pable violation of Some other parts of our Constitution. That noble Constitution was mostly made for free men and their produc tion and advancement. That Constitution says ("'Article VII," of the amendment.) ''In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved," &o. The liberty of freemen is greatly in dan ger, by tbis, our present, Fugitive Slave Law. Thjir slaves are "gradually bleaching out*' to wnraeaess. Some W thom'^re about as white as my swarthy complexion. Sup posing this monstrous communication—this liberty of the press, which I yet enjoy inlhis Republican laud of boasted freedom of speech and of the press shou meet the eye of some southerner, tyrannizing men. Two cf their unprincipled slave catchers might come here, and unscrupulously swear that 1 was their slave (and sore they would swear to the truth when I am once in their clutohes) and take me before tbat officer who the Fugitive Slave Late sets over our liberties. Where is my constitutional right of trial by jury Am I worth $20 1 appeal to Gov. Kirkwood to adhere to thit assertion, that answer he gave Gov. Dodge, "that no power on earth could compel him to assist in taking a fugitive slave,'' auJ when he shall see me fleeing, do not assist the pursuers. Suoh is the effect of tyrannical law, in violation of ihe best principles of cur sacred Constitution. We are freemen and we will nob abide by that monstrosity which so conflicts with our sacred rights. If this be treason to the Fugitive Slave Law, a mere thing of Southern Democratic tyranny, thanks to the wisdom of our fathers, it is not treason to the Constitution itself. No not to any part of it Mark the difference between a sl ive fleeing from bondage and a criminal fleeing, fnm justice—the former is a chattel, tho sams as a horse, and they demand of us that we help our Southern neighbors about their property, and it is not a demand that we help return a criiu inal to justice. Amendments to the Constitution:—When the Democracy cpen that up for amendment to perpetuate Slavery, 1 have an amendment to propose to perpetu.ite Freedom. When our fathers framed the Constitution they h*d considerable difficulty with the slave inter ests, and, as a compromise and for peace's sake, the North agreed that the -outh might have a slave representation in Congress and in the election of President. We bought that peace with wrong principles with an unjust price and we never got what we bought, except at shoit intervals, long sinoe entirely suspended. As nn equivalent for that slave representation, I propose that we have every school-house acd every rhurch in the Free States count equal fifty slaves The school-house and the church are the pride of our self governing people. Without them, we should not be qualified for self government. They are what Webster with such pride pointed out as the great bulwarks of our country. It is true and we ought all of us to kcow it and cherish the idea Are not these miro fit things for represent ation then slaves men who have no privi lege of reading, of voting or of speaking no privileges whatever, not even of self existence? I appeal to common sense, to know if my one amendment is not worth more—is not wiser and better every way than the President's three? And if I have one amendment to propose, there are five hundred thousand men in the North each of whom has a belter Amendment to propose than anv of Buchanan's thre^. Then how futile to attempt to amend our Constitution *ttbi8tiuie! Does ur retiring President attempt to throw a fire-brand among us He could not have t»ken a more sparkling and lively brand 1 Is that his p^ace mens ure, to feed us with the same fuel which kindled up the Republican party and elected Lincoln We intend, after the 4th of March next, to hurl back all such fire-bran Is as "Slavery in the Territories,1' "the Missouri Comprom ise," "unconstitutional Fugitive Slave Laws,'' "Dred Scott Decision," "slaverv amendments to the Constitution," the cun ing of our fc-'enators, their murderers in our I Congress, and the thousand other insults and crimes Southerners have committed against us.

XELEGRAJPHIC NEWS. [UVOIIU EIPKISflLT roa TH* JOCRNAl.J Tfce XXXVI tli Congress. Wasuijioton, Dec. 10 Sbnate.—Mr. Dixon said: \ye tannot shut our eyes to thc great truth that nothing less than the disruption of the Government u the peril to which we are now exposed. It is enough for us to know that it would be not only a great event, but, in its efleets on the race of mankind, tbe great calamity of the age. The controversy on the subject of slavery has now readied a point where lis honorable, rightful adjustment, consented to by tho people ot both sections, seems indts pensiblc to the continuance of the Government in its present form. The election of Lincoln hastened thy critical day. His defeat could only postpone it. I don't intend to say toat one section was more to blame than the other whether both were equally at fault, or whether the blame was wholly on one side. Crimina tions are now useless, nay, dangerous. If possible, the first thing done should be to restore the fraternal spirit waich once existed, iiow shall this be don?? By cheerfully and honestly assuring to every section its just constitutional rights. No section ought to ask more—none ought to ofl'er less. As to what are those constitutional rights, that isji subject to be considered in a spirit of con fidence, mutual good will and devotion to the Union, for the preservation of which my con stituents are ready to make any sacrifice that any reasonable man asks or an honorable man can grant, consistently with principle. In this spirit I shall meet this great question. In doing so, I shall be sustained by an im mense majority ol my constituents. If time shall show that I am wrong in this belief, I shall instantly cease to represent them hero. The people,, under God, must save this nation, if it is to be saved the politicians cannot do it. What I may be willing to do or the Senate be filling to do will avail Nothing, unless sustained by the intelligence and confidence of the people. There is a class of men North, perhaps South, small in numbers and influ ence, who assume that the present contest is a conflict of two civilizations—freedom or slavery must perish. The great body of those I represent do not thus believe. We believe there is no conflict of systems of labor in dif ferent btate^ incompatible with the peaceful existence of our Union. We believe the slaveholding and non-slavehalding States may still revolve in harmony that, if the question of slavery destroy the Union, it will be because the statesmen ot the day are incompetent to the task."
