To those who have looked upon the persistent advocates of good roads as merely enthusiasts, men carried away by excess of zeal and impatient for the accomplishment of too great ends; <-;-anks indeed, the recent researches of the New York "Sun" may be com mended to show that these same good roads cranks are very far from amen able to the charge of extravagance of economic ideas. The "Sun" entered upon a study of the claims of the good roads advocates and its discoveries justify fully all that these enthusiasts have put forward in the advocacy of their claims. The New York paper finds that approxi mately there are 14,000,000 horses in the United States, a decline of one mil ] on in the last ten years, due to the introduction of electric railways, the bicycle, horseless carriages and eco nomic motors for wheeled vehicles. Many more than half of the horses are used upon the public highways daily, fand this half has put upon them all the burdens of bad road conditions, re ducing their capacity and limiting their output of energy. Whatever, there fore, augments their ability saves time and money, There are in use also the same way about 2,000,000 mules, mainly in the South, The annual cost for fodder for these horses and mules is £1,500,000, --000. On a good, smooth stone road a horse or a mule can haul as much as three horses or three mules on a poor dirt road. Considering now the cost f>r feed, the work accomplished, or not accomplished, and the loss of time, to cay nothing of the influence of bad roads upon the development of rural sections, the "Sun" declares that the qiiestion of good roads rises to momen tous importance. It estimates that it will be necessary to build 1,000.000 miles of macadamized roads In the United States in order to give us a system relatively as good as that of Europe. But this, we take it, as an excessive estimate. However, taking the "Sun's" figures and the " Sun's" va;ues, and accepting its price pcx mile, $4,000, as correct for good r<,ads, and an outlay of $4,000,000,000 is Involved, a sum simply monstrous in proportions. But, says the "Sun," if one half of the draft animals could be dispensed with by reason of such construction, there would be an annual saving of §700,000,000 on the food bill Therefore, if road bonds were Issued bearing three per cent, interest, the people can build all the good roads they w'll ever need without increasing the trivnual cost to which they are now put, t,y so much as a single cent. Assum ing the "Sun's" figures to be even ap proximately correct, it should have added that the saving referred to would also discharge the principal regularly the interest. But then, dealing in such enormous "totals is unnecessary. It is needed only to consider a small section which 8s dependent upon use of country roads; consider the cost of maintaining poor rt*ids against the cost of construction and maintaining the good ones; take into account the saving in food for draft animals, the saving in time and the saving in number of animals nec essary to accomplish a given amount cf work, and then compare with the j suit of such consideration the cost of a good road. It will be found inva riably that the cost of the proper road Is the greater economy. The road cranks have to put up with a good deal of reproach and laughter and submit irv be cailed ImDrncticablea but some how. In every case where their theories have had practical tests, these same cianks triumph. Germany haa forced Hayti to accede to her demands in the Lueders case. The German I\nK has bCCU saluted, the IftTtH" >>m. iiils have put on sackcloth i uiui -irid th*' t«'i his of the pay .' . r tmm iit'l' mnlty have been set -11 d A grosser outrage has never been perpetrated upon an unoffending peo ple. Lueders violated the law of place and was punished as he deserved, and precisely as we would punish any alien who transgressed our police regulations for preservation of the public peace. A MATTER OF SELF-INTEREST. Last spring the Auditing Committee 01' the Board of Public Works gave the land-owners along the banks of the Sacramento River above this city and up to the mouth of the Feather notice that if they would repair their levee de fenses the board would construct es cape weirs, which are so much needed to give relief in Hood stages of the river. To this date the land-owners have taken no steps in the direction indicated, and now the season of high waters is near at hand. The Board of Public Works says that unless the owners act promptly there will be no putting in of the escape weirs, for whatever is done must be accomplished before the Legislature meets. While it may be true that levee building cannot be much prosecuted in the winter season, set the land-owners can get ready and take all the necessary preliminary steps for rapid work the instant the season permits. If this is done and good faith shown in the matter the board will also pre pare and be ready to put in the escape weirs as soon as it is possible to do so. This is a matter of self-interest to the land-owners, and it is unthinkable that they will any longer imperil the benefit promised them by inactivity in the premises. ANARCHISM AND LABOR. A female anarchist has been preach ing her gospel of destruction in Cleve land. 0.. to large audiences. Lately she took up the labor organizations, and in one of her lectures declared thijt. in every case the leaders in labor are cor rupt, selfish and can be bought and sold by the minions of bribery. This will do good. It will quicken the labor or ganization membership to give the lie to her assertion or to develop its truth It will do good by showing laboring men that anarchists have little or no sympathy with the organized methods of labor, nor with labor as a cause. The Cleveland "Leader" well says: Anarchists mix in labor for the purpose of using the working men as tools for the furthering of their schemes for the destruction of law and ord.-r Labor has been blind, appar ently, to the dangers of anarchy, for within the past eight or ten years trades unionism has frequently been brought into alliance with anarchy by Unwise and hot-headed leaders. The sweeping denunciation of the leaders of organized labor by one of the most ac tive of the advocates of anarchy is likeiy to have the effect of turning those men against the entire brood ol revolutionists. There is no reason for placing faith in the German story that China is pre pared to accede to German demands. There is far greater reason for the be lief that China will fight even to defeat. If she yields under such a threat as has been made, she can prepare her self 'or dismemberment. It is sug gested by the London "Times," how ever, that it may Indeed be true that China has consented to pay the indem nity demanded by Germany, but only in order to secure the evacuation of the IKjrts of Kiaochau Bay, for there is no word in the report of the concession, that China has agreed to the perma nent occupation by the Germans. But is there any reason to believe that Germany will be content with a partial concession to her claims? The Emper or of Germany is out for conquest, and he will secure a foothold at the bay of Kiaoehau by hook or by crook. He will find excuses for permanent occu pation of the seized territory. Will the great powers consent to such a pro gramme? Certainly, if they too are given the same liberty to fall upon the Chinese Empire and secure slices of its territory. However viewed, therefore, China is in a bad way. She must fight or suffer humiliation from which no nation could recover. But if she fights the chances are that she will be sound ly whipped. We can understand, there fore, the meaning of the Chinese Em peror's remark that before he will yield his soil to Germany, he will suffer the loss of his crown. It may be that he may be compelled to do both. It will be noted that President Mc- Kinley in his message in referring to the Cuban trouble declares that the new policy of Spain must produce satisfac tory results in "the near future" or the Tinted States will inervene with force to out a stop to the war. It must be accepted that the President is sincere in ih\.< declaration. To hold otherwise Would be without reason. Just what th t'i'sident means by "the mar fu ture" may. however, be considered an open question. Mr. Hannis Taylor is out in a statement that the Sagasta pian of autonomy is a hollow and D i iingless thing. The "Record-Un ion" took the same position yesterday. We believe that it ks, to say the least, an impracticable scheme, and will soon be so accepted by the judgment of im partial people. If in this we are cor rect then "the near future" referred to by the President»may Ir* very near In deed. Mr. Taylor g'»-s further, however, and holds that the offer or grant of autonomy by royal decree of the Span ish Crown is without lawful effect, that it has no constitutional guarantee or validity, for such a grant must have the legislative action of both houses of the Cortea If in this he is correct, then the insincerity of Sagasta's offer w;ll appear and the Cuban contention will be sustained, that it is merely a trick to cheat them.

SACRAMENTO DAILY VWOKD-imiOTs. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1897. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL EXPRESSION. State and Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living News Interest. Oakland Enquirer: Washington dis patches state that the Administration, e< ing the revenues of the Government ar< not going to be sufficient to do more than pay running expenses, has passed the word along the line to cut down the estimates, and already they nave oeen reduced about $20,060j000.< This means, among other things, that there will be no money for new Postofnees, neither for Oakland or other cities, and that harbor appropriations, too. will be kept down to the lowest limit. Another thing which is indicated is that the Nicaragua canal must wait another year at least before Congress will venture to a bill looking to its construction. POLITICS AS A CORRUPTOR. Los Angeles Herald: What is the in fluence in politics and office-holding that causes the ruin of so many men. How many times it has occurred that men who ranked high in the estimation ot the community in which they lived, who enjoyed the confidence and respect of all with whom they came in contact in business and social circles, have be< n unable to withstand the temptations and unlawful allurements of politics and place-holding. There are men who take us politics and secure office merely as a means to an unlawful end. They would be dis honest in any other occupation. Their opportunities or their predilections maj have led them into the political field a< one takes up any business. Such men are scoundrels according to their abd tty, as they would be anywhere. They make it their avocation to prey off the commnnlty. To hold office is an honorable ambi tion, and in a republic like ours, where honors and emoluments of office are conferred through the suffrages of the people, where the private citizen of to day may become the public official of to morrow, such ambition is quite general, and properly so. The trouble with many men is that they do not have the right idea of the duties and the respon sibilities of office-holding. TWO VITAL POINTS. Stockton Record: The President's message will be disappointing to many members of Congress, at least in one particular. More radical measures re garding the relations of Spr.-n and Cuba were expected in his recommendations. We have no doubt that the extreme jingoes like Senator Morgan will raise a great cry, but *hat the President's views are sound will not be questioned by the better and wiser forces of the na tion. It was certainly not our place to condemn the new 7 scheme of autonomy before it is tried. The Government of Spam, at least its immediate policy, has been revolutionized in response to American sentiment, and the President has taken the statesman-!iK.e c urse in declining to inaugurate an active in terference that may be seriously re gretted. The recommendations resoeotina the currency have been so entire!*' fore shadowed by press dispatches and by Secretary Gage's report thai they will occasion no surprise. In fa~t it has been known ever since Mr. Gage was selected for the Treasury Department just what course the Administration would take in financial matters. His views will be indorsed by a majority of the Hou'33, but there is no prospect of legislation on the subject at the present session of Con gress. HOW 

EASY. Tulare- Register: What a simple thing it is, to be sure! And why lid not we or some one of our readers think of it? A very long shaft of vibrating decline, a mountain of low grade iron ore ground into powder and sent sift ing down the shaft, powerful magnets stationed along at certain places to draw the particles of iron ore toward certain side chutes which lead to im mense bins and, presto! the iron ore is extracted and ready to be melted and cast into pigs, one of the most import ant inventions of this eventually inven tive age, but it took the wizard, Ttus. A. Edison, six years of hard work and cost him a million or more dollars to perfect the device. That is one reason why we did not undertake the ven ture. The other is that we never thought of it. Till-; PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. San Jose Herald: Th" President's message has one especial merit It starts in on business almost from the first paragraph, and it forbears to re hash the departmental reports. Oth erwise it is of fair business character, as messages go, making some definite recommendations but omitting ochers in matters of more importance. Regarding the work of the extra ses sion, the message commends it, admit ting that it has not yet had its full ef fect, but that the prospects are hope ful. On the currency question the mes sage is remarkable for what it hints at rather than for what it says. It does, to be sure, make a definite recommen dation that whenever the condition of the treasury permits, greenbacks re ceived should not be re-issued except for gold. Beyond that it states at great length and with much force the | danger Cif further bond issues unless something shall be done to prevent that result. The inference is inevitable that I the President expects to have to issue bonds under the operation of the Ding ley law. He also proposes to let the na tional banks issue notes up to the face value of their bonds, but to issue none j smaller than .Sin. This is presumably !to giv' silver a show. Curiotisly enough I thi President manages to extract some (comfort from the visit of his pet bimet allic commission to Europe, and pro- I fosses to believe that its object may yet be accomplished. This will cause a I smile in European financial circles, j There is no further suggestion on the monetary question and really nothing I further was to be expected. Repub i Ucanism has no policy to offer, and na Ct essmnal action can be expected, except, possibly, pome patchwork The President has a great deal to say ! about the Cuban imbroglio, but It is not very satisfactory to the friends nf ; Cuba. Briefly his attitude is that here i tof ore indicated by his official course land public expressions. He considers I recognition unwise and madmissahle. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. San im Mercury: The contrast be* I twees the lucid, business-like docu i merit which President McKinley pre j seated to Congress yesterday and the i ponderously-worded messages of his predecessor Is not more marked than it is pleasing. The President's first mes sage is a modesi straightforward pa per, in whi' h. unlike those of President ' Cleveland, there is no display of ego j tistn and no attempt to create politi- cal capital by appeals to partisan prej udice. As a whole it is a plain and sat isfactory review of existing national conditions and of our existing reiat! tfl with other countries, and, with possibly one or two exceptions, the recommen dations which it contains will be we!! received by the great majority of ihe American people. A 

RETRACTION*. Oakland Times: A singular example of international interference is fur nished by the demand of the Imperial Government of Germany for an apol ogy from the "Osservatore Romano.'' the official organ of the Papacy, in Rome, for an article recently printed assailing Martin Luther. The strang est part of the whole affair is that a re traction and an apology were realty printed. The case promises to become a nine days' wonder to the theologians and politicians in Europe. OUR ROAD ELECTION". Santa Rosa Republican: The good road issue has had a fair test before the people of Sacramento County. Bonds have been voted there to build a boulevard from Sacramento City to Folaom. They were carried by an overs'helming majority—about 9 to 1. This road will be really the first permanent highway to be built in the State. It will be constructed on scien tific principles and crushed stone will be the material used. Such a road will last for centuries and will be an object lesson to the people of the State. It will be the forerunner of other similar enterprises that will furnish employ ment for idle people and result in the permanent development of the entire commonwealth. THE MESSAGE. Fresno Expositor: The first impres sion is that the message is a weak one. This is notably true of the financial and Cuban features, while it is strong on Hawaiian annexation. On all the live political issues the President seems inclined to straddle the fence, but on other matters he seems fair and in clined to a liberal and fostering policy. 

BUSINESS REVIVAL. Los Angeles Times: The reports of a general revival of business at Chi cago afford some substantial evidence of the rising tide of prosperity which la sweeping over the country. No city was affected more strongly than Chi cago by the wide-spread depression Which followed the panic of 1898. For three years business was at a stand still in almost every line of trade and real estate was almost unsalable. For several months past evidences of a wel come change have been apparent. The bank clearings in Chicago for Novem ber reached the remarkable total of $458,000,000, the high-water mark for four years and a half. Money is plen tiful in the Windy City, and bankers find it difficult to loan the funds which are crowding their vaults. A DRASTIC REMEDY. Sutter Independent: The large num ber of recent hank failures, in several instances for enormous amounts, vary ing from $500,000 to $2,t«K>,tK)o. a great portion of which consisted of the hard earnings of what is known as the poor er classes of our people, suggests, as perhaps the most practical way of pre venting the recurrence of future dis asters of a like character, the applica tion of the Chinese remedy inflicted up on the occasion of the first bank fail ure in the Celestial Empire, when, the following morning, the bodies of the officers were found swinging from the lamp posts In front of the budding. That happened over 2.U00 years ago, and there has never been a bank fail ure in China since. The remedy is severe, but the medicine need only be taken voluntarily when the patient willingly takes the consequences. Some thing must and will be done to put a stop to this high-handed thievery of robbing the honest, contiding and un suspecting public. DEADLY COMPP:TTTION. Sutter Farmer: That "deadly com petition" which the silver-using coun tries were supposed to be making against the ("nited States in interna tional commerce will now disappear in the case of Russia. Japan and several of the South and Central American States, which have all gone from the silver to the gold standard since Mr. Teller started that argument into the field. Word now comes that China is about to follow in the same wake, thus leaving Mexico and a few South Amer ican countries our only "deadly com petitors," and reducing still further the ammunition of the silver mine own- ORGANIZE. Placer Republican: We would like to see some definite steps taken by the farmers in regard to organizing a Farmers' Club. There is such a vast field for labor, so much may and should be done that can properly be done only by the farmers. Tin- world to-day calls for intelli j gent, organized effort on the part of ! any class that occupies an important place in it. This is a generally accept ed fact, and labor and trade unions, merchants' exchanges, etc., have been formed in compliance with this de mand. As a class farmers have not recognized the necessity, but the time is near at hand when the successful farmer must be associated with his fellows, must subscribe for and read journals devoted to agriculture and horticulture, must in fact keep in touch with progressive thought in his line of work. We frequently hear farmers be wailing adverse circumstances and un certain returnc —sometimes no returns at ail. In this wonderfully endowed State, where almosl everything may be successfully grown, with good ship ping facilities, and markets at home and abroad awaiting our products, con ditions should be favorable to the pro ducer, if they they could be favorable anywhere. THE LOS ANGELES SCANDAL. Stockton Independent: If there is one department of the Government that, more than any other, should be tree from scandal. It should be that of edu cation. Happily for the country in gen eral it is so in most eommunitles outside the largest cities. Eos Angeles seems to be an exc< ption to the rule and the in dications are that the present is not the lirst corruption though it is the nrst to be exposed. The evidence ».hat it is not the first is the fact that an ex member of the board is one of the men through whom blackmail was paid to a member of the present board. This go between is a minister, whose profession should have made him refuse the serv ice if his sense of right and wrong had not been blunted by familiarity with corruption. Now that the scandal is out he says he acted under protest to save a member of his congregation from discharge from his humble employment as a janitor. He and his friends are to be pitied, but he is hardly to be ex cused. IT IS 

PROFITABLE. Fresno Republican: There is no more profitable investment of public funds, especially for farmers, than in the im provement of roads, provided always that work is intelligently and honestly done. The "Republican" believes It to be a great misfortune that the new road 1i v enacted by the last Legislature failed to become operative. The exist ing law is very unsatisfactory. BY THE JOKERS.

Why is it that the source of their highest joys is at the same time the cause of their greatest wTetched ness? The very attributes which make it possible for women to be happy wives and mothers also render them liable to the ut most physical misery and pain. The sufferings of body and mind caused by some weakness of the distinctly feminine organs are so almost universal among wo men that the question might well be asked. " Is this Nature's punishment for the crimr of being a woman ? " The true answer is No! These sufferings are neither natural nor necessary. They would not exist if the organism was healthy. No woman ought to endure such troubles. There is no need of it. Dr. Pierces Favor ite Prescription is a perfect and positive cure for feminine weakness and disease.
