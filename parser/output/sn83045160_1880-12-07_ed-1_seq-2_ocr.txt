Thk twenty-four Socialist exiles recently arrived in Xcw York from Germany wen welcomed in the Germania assembly rooms Sunday by 2000 people, one-fourth of whom were women, and the entire assemblage wore red silk ribbons, bows or rosettes. The hall was decorated with Commune flags. Resolu tions were adopted denouncing Bismarck and Hohenzellern. The nuisance bill, one of the most strin gent liquor-prohibiting bills ever passed in Yerrnont,'pasaed both branches of the legis ture. This bill makes any place of resort where liquor is sold or given away, or where gambling is allowed, a nuisance and the place is shut up, the keeper being fumed from $'20 to S-00 and imprisoned for three months. The remains of Lieut nant-Governor-elect Robinson, of Colorado, who died from acci dental shooting at Iadville a week ago. arrived at Kalamazoo, Michigan, yesterday, and were received by the municipal officers, military deputations, civic societies and a large concourse of citizens. The remains lay in state in the council-room yesterday under a guard of honor, and were visited by great numbers of people. A severe cyclone, accompanied by thun der and lightning the electric shocks being very violent, passed over southwestern Mis souri Saturday evening, doing great damage to property. One man was killed and two children fatally injured. The storm passed near Joplin and Carthage, and the town of Marshlield, which was nearly destroyed last summer, was visited by this storm and great damage was done. It was stated in army circles in Wash ington last night that it has beeu determined to place Brigadier-General E. O. C. Ord, of the department of Texas, on the retired list, and that Brigadier-General Christopher C. Augur lias been assigned to the depart ment of Texas, and Colonel Henry J.

About one hundred cars of corn were sent down the Iron Mountain and Southern road to Belmont last night, where it will be put aboard barges for New Orleans. Two or three hundred cars will follow as rapidly as possible, and the Cairo Short Line has arranged to take two or three hundred cars of corn to Cairo, where it will be trans ferred to barges for the same port. All this corn is for shipment to Europe. There u an immense Land league de monstration at Waterford, Ireland, Sunday. Parnell, in a speech, denounced the govern ment, which he said was too weak to ueal with the land subject, and hoped to crush the movement by depriv ing the people of their representatives in parliament. Parnell's visit to Waterford is believed to be his last public engagement for the present. Several other Land league meetings were held in Ireland Sunday.

Tar. weekly review of the F.ngllsh bread Attffs market asserts that there is no question as to the world's surplus of marketable breadstuff being above the consumptive de mands of the United Kingdom for the year, and the only thing that keeps the prices at the present level is the scarcity of spot and near supplies. I'ntil the beginning of the past week speculation has beeu active in A uterica, but found not the faintest response here. America's surplus is admitted to be above last year, while European require ment are less. The late harvest ami in creased and prosperity in America has re tarded the movement of the surplus to the sea board. Meanwhile the Lulled Kingdom has been well supplied from other sources. Even the Russian contingent is not much smaller than last year, while Australian and Indian supplies are liberal. If the present position is maintained ft r another six weeks, a very material portion of the American surplus el breadstuff will find no market. Thesmal! nea of stock gives holders an advantage at the same time buyers rely on American, Aus tralian and Indian supplies to send down prices. The American surplus will soon be come a weakening element. The London Time, reviewing the forecast of President Hayes' message to congress, congratulates the I'nited State on the nn eventfulness of the annals of the adminiftra tion and the satisfactory .-tale of finances. Relative to the fisheries question, the article aye that the doctrine attributed to the late government that the local laws of Canada could override the treaty obligations, was never advanced by them. The great point at issue between Lord Salisbury and Mr. Krart was the true meaning of the treaty of Washington in respect to the concur rent priviliges of citizens of the United State- and the li.roinion on the coasts of the latter. This point may have been mis construed, and Karl Granville, at present foreign secretary, may have removed the misconception. It is, however, most desir able that tiie whole question should be settled in a more permanent fashion than ii eoaueia plmled by the treaty of Washington, whi-h seems purposely framed to provide for he rwcurrins! occasions of a quarrel. A n ;w mrnmisnon is to be appointed, and au effcrt should be made to effect a final settlement of tie wbeie auet4 .

Private Secretary W. K. Kodgera appeared ami de livered the message of the President, and it w as read, aa follows: PreMldent'M Mesiiairf. Fellow-Citizens ol the Senate and House of Keprc eiitativen: I congratulate you on the continued and iuercas ing prosperity of our country- By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed, during the jaunt year, with health, and abundant harvests, with profitable employment for all our teoplc, ami with contentment at 'home, and with peace and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of Chief MaKitratc has afforded another opportunity to the people ol the I'nited States to exhibit to the world a siguticaut example of the , eful and afe transmission id the power and authority of government from the public servants whose lenns of ollice are about to expire, to their newly-chosen successors, Thi ciumple cannot fail to impresa profoundly, ihuughlful people uf other countriea with the ad vantages which republican institutions afford. The immediate, general, and cheerful aeo,uieaceme of all good eituens, in the result of the election, gives gratifying assurance to our couutry, and to its trlcnds throughout ihe world, that a government based on the free consent of an Intelligent and patriotic people posse amis elements of strength, stability and permanency not found in any other form of government. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of rHX 

RIGHTS OF riTIZENSHIP, CuNKEKRtD VPOS THE COLORED PEOPLE by the recent amendments to the constitution, still prevails in several of the late slave-holding State It has, i- rii.ti.v not been manifested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac tices in connection with the ballots, with the regu lations as to the phtces and manner of voting, and with counting, returning and canvassing the vote cat, been successful iu defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all rights, the right of suf frage, which the constitution expressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens. It ts the desire of Uic good i-cupic of the whole country that section alUm ss a factor in our politics should dlsamear. They prefer that no section of the country anould be united in aolid opposition to any other section. The diapotdiiou to refuse a prompt and hearty ObesVsssae to the equal-right amendments to the constitution is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional Hues in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed tliem . n tlie constitution, as embodying the legi:i mate re sults of the war for the riiioii.and who believe them to be w ise said necessary, will continue to act to gether, and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount ijnestion still is aa to the enjoyment of the right by every American eiti.cm who has the re-iui-ite u,uaUiics,tioiis to freely cast his vote and to have It honestly counted. With this question rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the contentions of the past ; oygoncs will indeed le bygones, aud political and party Issues with respect to economy and efficiency oi administration, internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance, and other important subjects, will then receive their full share of attention : but resistance to and nul lification of the results of the war, w ill unite to gether in resolute purpose forthell support all who maintain the authority of the government and the perpetuity of the I'uion, and who adequately ap preciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment r feeling to any part of the people of our countrv, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the fundamental prin ciple of our government. They are the solemn ex pressiuu of ine will of the people of the Catted Slates. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must be maintained, does not grow weaker. It will continue to control ihe government of the country. Happily, the history f the late election shows that iu many parts of the country w here opposition to the Fifteenth amend ment has heretofore prevailed. It is nmiuishing. and is likely to cease altogether, i; dm and well- conaidered action is taken by congress. trust the house of representatives and the sec ste, which have the right to Judge of the electiou returns, and alifieatioiis of their own members, w ill sec to it tfiaLevery ca of violation uf the lettcror spirit ol me fifteen tti cuueudment U thoroughly investigated and that no beueflt for such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive, with rraffloflnl tppropriatiims for tha purpose, to prose- lie uu.-puftugly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to theiu by the constitution. It is not, ho.vever, bo be forgotteu that the best And surest guarantee of the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for sell -protection whit h can belong only to a people whoso right to uni versal suffrage is SUPPORTED BY 1'N'I VERdAL EDUCATION. The means at the couuiumd of the local and State authorities are in many instances wholly in adequate t' furnish free instruction to all who need It. This is ewpociallr true where before eman cipation the education of tiie ieople was neglected or prevented in the interest of slavery. 5'irmly convinced that the subject of populur education d serves the attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise sua comprehensive action by the government of the United States, I respectfully nouimend that con gross, by suitable legislation and with on it safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States where the grave duties and resj-onsiLilities of citi zenship have been devolved on uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose granU of the public lands, and, U necessary, bT appropriations from the treasury of the United States. Whatever gov ern men t cau fairly do to promote free popular edu cation ought to be done. hcrcver general educa tion is found, pca-e, virtue and social order pre vail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. Iu my former annual messages I have asked the.atteu tion of congress to Hit urgent necessity of a refor mation of THE 

CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM of the government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appoiutments fur personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience iu the executive office, and 1 believe these dangers thrvateii the sta bility ot tiie government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be perinaueutlv tolerated . They tend to become more alarming with the en largement oi aumiuisirauvc service, as me growui tne country ia iiopuiallou in creaks the number f oflic lid i.laccmell employed The realms are imperative lor the adoptiou of tixed rules for me rcgumiion oi appoiuimcnis, irmotions, anu removals, csmblishing a uniform method, haviiic exclusively in view, in every instance, the attain ment of the best u.ualiticatious for the ioition in iuestiwn. 8ueh a methml alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most eco nomical and emcientadnunlstraUon of the public business. Competitive examinations, in aid of im partial apikoiiitinents and promotions, have been MKiuctcii ior some- years icst in several oi tiie executive departments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the customhouses and ooslulliees of tiie larger cities of the country. In the city of New York over two thousand positions in the civil service have been subject lu their ap pointments and tenure of place, to the operation of published rules for this purpose during the past two years. The result of the practical trials havH verv satisfac torv. ami have confirmed my opinion in'favor of tlo-'c-tem of selection. All are subjected to the same tcatx, and the resuit is fret; from prejudice ;by personal tavur or partisan iuduetirc. It aeciires for the position applied for the best OHalihcatfon attainable among the com- peUug BDplicauta. It is mi effectual protecliuii from the pressure of importunity which, under any other coura pursued, largely exacts Hie time ami attention . aprM1tiug otheers, to the great detriiuent in the dlsvhukgi' of other otna lal duties, preventing the abuse of the service for the mere lurtherance of private or party purposes, ana leaving the employe of the government, freed from the obligations impccd by jMLtrouge, to DEPEND SOLELY CPo aJERIT for retention and advancement, and with thii con stant Incentive to exertion apd improvement. The-e invaluable results hare been attained in a high de cree iu tlie ofiiiat where the rides for appointment by competitive examination isaje otcu appneo. A method whu n nas m appruvdi itsen y tests at points where such tests may Ik- fairly ctinsidtTcd conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate positions under the government, I believe that a strong and growing public seutluiant demands Im mediate measures fur securing and en forcing the highest possible efficiency in the civil service and its protection from recognized abuses, and that the expe rience reicrred to has demonstrated the feasibility oi such maaxures. The examinations in the cus tomhousrs and ptsstofTlces have been held under many embarrass ui en ts nj withtuit provision for compensation for the extra labor jt-rfonned by tha officers who have conducted them, snd w hose com mendable interest in the improvement of the pub lie service induced this devolion of time and labor without pecuutarv reward. A continuance of these labOCl gratuitously ought not to be ex pected, and without an appropriation by congress for compensation, it is not practicable to extend itu sgaUgfl erf uxniuin:ilions generally Utroughiut the civil service. It is also highly Important thai all such'examt nations shooUI be conducted upon a uniform system and unibr general ciipervisio!i. Sectlou 17i3 of the revlsetl statutes authorize- the 1'resi lenl topreaiiribe the regnlalions for udiuission to tiie civil service oi u j United Suites, and for this purjiose to employ suitable i arsons to condn t the requisite iunuiries with reference to ' ihe lit nesa of each candidate, iu respect to age, lieult:i, character, knowledge and ability, for the branch of nrvioa which he seeks to enter:" hnt the law Is practically Inoperative for want ftf ihe requisite appropriation. I then-fore C -amend an appropriation of f.ouu bei annum to meet the expenses of a romrn u. to be a; pointad bv the President iu ai e with tiie terms of this section, whose dut fi suall be to de vise a just.

The mosl effectual check upon the pernicious oossuaetttlon ol influence and official favoritism, in the bestowal of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of mem between "the applicants. In which every one cau make his own record wilb the assurance that his success will dejHud upon this uloue.

The most serious obstacle, now ever, to an improvement of tha civil sen ice. and cspeejallv tt a reform In tiie method of appointment and removal, has been found to be the pr iclice. under what is known aj the siadls system, by which the appointing power has Man ao large U cucroarhed upon by members of congress. The first step In the reform of the ciwi service must bv a complete divorce Isetween con gress and the executive in the matter of sppoii t luenrs.

It comes to be underdo d by applicant for t.ffice, and by ihe anopla gener ally, tuat representative!, and senators arc autilh d to dishurse ihe patronage of their respective dis tricts and States. It is not necessary to cite at length the evils resulting from thi invasion of the executive functions. The true principles of gov ernment on the subject uf appointmynts to oflic a-stated in the uatUmal coiiveiiUous of the lead fug parties of the couutry. have again and again been approved by the Americau people, ami have not been called in question in any quarter. The.-? auUieutic expreasious uf public opinion upon this ail important subject, are the statement of ptin i plcs that bnlnoa to the couatjtuiioual structure oi the governments. "Under the constitution, the President and heads of department- are to MAKE NOMINATIONS FOR OFFICE. The senate Is to advise and consent to appoint ments, and the house of represcnlattvee vstoai cuse and prosecute faithless oilkxt. The K-st in terest uf toe public service demands that these dis tinctions be respected ; that senators ami repre sentatives, who may be Judges and abusers, fchouhi not dictate appointment U offlce. To Uiis end the t-o-operaliou of the legislative depart ment of the government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion.

If thorough measures are adopted, it Is believed that within a few years the evils which now affti I Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in good lime become one of the most pros perous and attractive of the new States of the Union.

FISHERY CLAUSES of the treaty of Washington, w hich, as ihe corre spondence netween the two governments stood at the close of the last session of congress, seemed to be irreconcilable. Iu the iinportaut exhibitions of arts and jfridnstriea, which was hold last year at Sydney, Nenv South Wales, as well as that now in progress at MelU.nrne. the Dnited Bmtet have been efficiently ar.d honorably lepteeented.

In the exhibition at MellHjurrtc, the share taken by our country Is no lent notable, and au equal share of success is c-ntidently expected. The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed bj all the nations of the continent of Europe has lis favorable influence upon our diplomatic and Q tm mcrcial relations with them.

There have been some ques tions raised between the two governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties : naturalization, but receut dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that msutoble progress is making toward An understanding, in accordance with the views of this goWel ment, which makes and admits no dnrangtion whatever between the rights oi" a native and a ualurulizcd citizen of the United States.

The aeceptaneeof tnu invitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in this important measure, des'ciied to establish a system of interna tional notification by which the spread of lufcc tious or epidemic diseases may be more effectually checked or prevented. This attention of congress b invited to the necessary appropriations for car rying into eflect the provisions of the act refer re 1 t. The efforts of the department of State to en large the trade and commerce of tho United States, through the active agency of consular officers aud through the dissemi -ation of Information ob- tic -d from mem, have been unrclaxed. The in terest in these efforts, as developed in ourcommcr- lal communities, and the value of the iuformation secured by this means to the trade and manufac tures of the country, were irtOJfnlBpfl by congress at its last session, and provision was made for me more frequent puiuicauoii oi consular ana other reports by the department of State. The first issue of ihll publication lias now beeu prepared, and obecquent isues may regularly be expected. The Importance and interest attached to the ro norts of consular ofliccrs arc w i messed bv the ceil end demand for them by all classes uf merchants and man uiactnrers engaged m our foreign trad It is believed that the system of such publicatii Is deserving of the approval of congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continuance and enlargement win commend ltsi-ii to your con sideration. The prosierous energies of OUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES, and their immense production of the subjects of foreigu commerce, invite, and even require, uu active development of the wishes aud interests of our people In that direction. Especially Import ant is it that our commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with lie West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of European sj s teuis. and should be cu tried on iu our own bot toms. The full appreciation ol the opportunities WIIICD. our front on tno rWCmc ocean gives to com merce with Japan, China and the East ludies, with Australia aud the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal eflbrts to approprfem to our own shipping, ami to administer by ourown capital. due proportion of this trade. Whatever modanesittetis Of our regula tion! uf trade and na Station may be necessary or H-eful lomect and direct these impulses to the en largement of our exchanges and of our carrying trade. I am sure the wisdom of congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture u press it ujkju your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of reg ular steam postal communication, by aid from government, lias been the forerunner of the com mercial predominance nf Great Itritaln on all these coasts and seas, a greater shore in whose trade Is now the desire and ihe intent of our peo ple. It is also msnJfeet that tlie efforts of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this trade have been successful in proportion with their adoption of regular steam poem communication with the markets whose trade they -ought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious to receive such postul coni munications u ith this country, and to aid In their development. Similar co-operation may be looked tor. in duo time, bom the eastern nations and from Australia It is difficult to see how the lend in this move n: en t can be: expected from private In fa rests, in respect to foreign commerce, quite ai much as internal trade, iKtstal communication seems neeessnrQy a matter of common aud public administration, and thus ertaining to govern ment. 1 respectttiliy recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as muv Conduce to the development of onr foreigu com mercial exenanges ana THE RUU.DING U POFOU R C ARRYING TRAIK. Iu this -connection I desire also to suggest the very great se rvice which might be expected in en larging and facilitating our commerce on the Pa cific ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from San Franc Iseo to tin Handivich Islands, ami thcuce to Japan at the north and Australia at thy south. The great muuence oi sucn means oi communication on these routes of navigation, in develoivlmr and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in tlie commerce of the world, needs no illustration or en forcement It may be that such an entcipnse, u fill and In the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may need to be ac derated by prudent legislation by congress in its aid, aud i submit the nmtter to yon? careful consideration.

CONTINUANCE OF SPECIE PAYMENTS has not been interrupted or endangered since tlie date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business aud to our remarkable pros lcrity.

No con.-ider-ab'.e t mount of I'nited Slates notes have been pre sented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imjN.rtcd. are ; ik D to the mints and exchangetl fc r coin or notes.

I therefore reicat what was sdd in tne annual message of last ear, that the retire ment from circulation of Fnilcd States note?, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a sti i to be taken in our i.rogres- toward a safe and Sterne currenc y, which should he accepted as the policy and duty of the government and the inter rat and security of the neojple.

There were other rappoiteM of the bill, who, while tney doubted as to the irrrTtahfltty of this result, nevertheless were willing to give the proposed experiment a lair trial, with a view to stop the coinage, if exp rience sbeuld prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued to be of less commercial value than the standard goU dollar, The coinage uf silver dollars, under the act referred to. began in March, 1S78, and has la en c ontinued as munfzed by the act. The average i ate per m :i h to the present time has been 52.276. 492. The total amount c oined to the l&t.oi November hist was ?7'.s7.7jO. Of this amount i7.om, 4.-0 remain In the treasure, and onlyiTOSjSfl iirc In the hands of the people, a Loiistanteilort hag been made to keep tins ur rency in circulation, and coiisidersble expenae has been necessai:ly incurred fur mis purpose, but its return to the Ir, asury is prompt and sure Coii tmry tO the m: Odent anticipation of the frii nds cd the measure at the time of Its adoption, the value of the silver dollar, containing 412!, grains of silver, has not increased During the year prior to the pasaagn of the bill authorising its coinage, the market alue u; the siher which it contained was from ninety to ninety two cents, M euinpured with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight and a half cents. It is obvious that the legislation of the las: longreas iu regard tu silver, so far aa it wag Wsed on an anticipated rise in silver as a result of mm k-rissu-'ii, na laucvi io prouuee ine encci then predicted. The lunger the law reuinlnfc in I t . : o'dr;:. ai il doc t.ji e. i in cut a noniiu :1 d llar, which, in rcairty.

The constitution of the t nitcd States, sound financial principles and our best interests, all reouire that the country should have as its legal tender money, BOTH GOLD AND SILVER COIN, of an intrinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The constitution. In express terms, recognises both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metal from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange to the dispanigemcnt of importunt in terests. The United States produces more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one uf the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will. In my judgment, contribute to this result if con gress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only H J1 .grains of silver, and in its stead will au thorize the secretary' nf thn title ll to coin silver dollars oi equivalent value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no man. and will be in accordance with familiar precedents. Congress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly In accordance with the actual ratio uf value between the two metals. In financial legis lation every measure jn the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pccuuianmbligations, bag been found bj experience to diminish the raws of in tercet which debtors are required to pav, and to increase the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence in the exact performance of moneved obligations is established. Tins sc retake of war reports that the expenditures of the w.ir oe part men r for the fiscal year ended June 'M, ls,so. were $39,924,773 0;.

'ith respect to the army, trie secretary invites attention to the met that its strength is limited by statute (section '.'.I.-, revised statutes) to NOT Ml IRB 

THAN 30,000 ENI.LsTED MEN, but that provisos contained in npnipilelinli bills have limited expenses to th enlistment of but 23 -0OA It io believed the full legal strength is the least possible force at whi h the present organiza ti m can be maintained, be ing iu view efficiency discipline an I economy. While the enlistment of this torce would add somewhat to the appropria tion for pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivaleut for this additional outlay, and the eilicicney of tlie army would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and the t;reat tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new territory-, impose on the military an entire change of policy. The main tenance of small posts along wagon end stage routes of travel is no longer necessary. Perma nent quarters at poiuts selected, of a more sub stantial character than those heretofore construct ed, edU bo required. Under existing laws. iK'rma net buildings cannot be erected without the sanc tion of Congress, and when sales of military sites aud buildings have bona authorized, the monevs received have reverted to the treasury, and could only become available through a new appropria tion. It is recommended that provision be made, by a general statute, for the sale of such aban doned military posts and buildings as arc found to be unnecessary, and forthe application of the pro ceeds to the construction ef other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed condi tion of the country, their occupation is continued St groat expense and fneouvenieuce, tsseasuM they it lord the only available shelter for troops. The absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty, from their regiments, is a serious detri ment to the maintenance of the service. The con stant demand for small detachments, each of Which should be commanded by a commissioned officer, and tho various details of oficers for neces sary service away from their commands, occasions a ar i!y in the number required for company du ties. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law authoriz ing the detail of officers from the active list us pro fessors of tactics and military science at Certain colleges ami universities, be so amended as toim vide that all such details be made fr m the retired list of the army. Attention is asked to the neces sity oi providing by legislation for organizing, arming, and disciplining THE ACTIVE MILITIA OF TIIE COUNTRY, and liberal appropriations are recommended in this behalf. The reports of the atrjutant-gericral of the army ami the chief of ordnance touching this subject fully ses forth its importance. The re port of lite officer in charge of education in the army shows that there are seventh-eight schools now in operation In the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2805 enlisted men and children. The secretary recommends the cnlistmci.t of 150 school masters, with the rank and pay of oommiss-irv ser geants. An appropriation is needed to Supply the ji; ige advocates of the army with mitable librar ies, and the secretary recommends that the corps of judge-advocates be placed upon the same foot ing, as to promotion, with the other staff corps of the army. 1'nder existing laws, the bureau of military justice consists of one officer, the judge advocate general, and the corps of Judge-advocates, of eight officers of equal rank, (mtjors'i, with a provision that the limit of the corplrsfcall remain at four, when reduced by casualty or icsignat ion to that number. The consolidation of he bureau of military justice, ami the corps uf judge-advocate?, upon the same basis with the other ctatT corps of tho assay, would remove an unjust discrimination against deserving o Ulcers, and subserve the best in tereetaof the service. Especial attention is asked to the report of the chief of engineers upon the condition of our national defenses. From a per sonal inspection of many of the fortifications referred to, the secretary 1h able to emphasize the recommendations made, and to state that their incomplete and defenceless condition is disc reditable to the conn try. While other nations have been Increasing their means for carrying on offensive warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have teen dormant In preparation for defence nothing of iinportancc has been done toward finishing OUT casemated w Th- since our late civil war, during which the gre.it guns of modern warfare and heavy armor of moden fortifications and ships came' into use among the nations, and our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appropriation torn, years since, In all stages of iucomplctinn, are now icing rapid lv destroyed by the elements. The iw great riven of tho North American continent, th; Mississippi and the Columbia, have their navigtble unlets w holly w ithin the limits of the United States, and are of vast importance to our interial and for eicn commerce. The permantnuy of tie important work on THE SOUTH PASS OF THK MISSISSIIPI IUVKR Bums now to le assured. There has been no fail ure whatever in tho maintenance of the maximum channel during the six months ended August 9th, last. This experiment haa opened alroad deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the aessnanent successes' which, congratula tions may be exchanged among people abntad and at home, and especially among ihccomtiunities of tiie Mississippi valley, whose commercial ex changes float in an unobstructed chantifl safely to and from the sea. A comprehensive imrovement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a matter of transcendent nnportnoce. Then great vater-wav comprise a system of inland transiortataon sprend like net-work over a hirer portion of the Unite! Mates, and navigahle to the extent of nnny thou sands of miles. Producer and consumers alike, have a C'-mnion interest in such unequalled facili ties for cheap transportation. Geographical I v, com mercially, and politically, they are the strongest tie bnsWnen the various sections of the country. These channels of communication snd inte'r cnange are the property of the nation. Its inris diction is paramount over their waters, nnd the plainest pvsncfnseaof public interest cijnlisj their intelligent and careful super vision, v ith a view to Ihrlr prntrrjigen Imfmrrrrmrnt and thcenhaucc lnentnf tofr useiuiness. The channel of the f " lumbiai ver, f or a i i uince of about 100 mileai'rom its mouth. i-s obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion serious delays in navigation, and heavy expense fur lighterage and towage. A depth of at Vast tw . nty feet at low tide should be secured and maintained, to meet the requirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean com merce it subserves. The most urgent need, how ever, fur this groat water-way i a permanent im pruvemeul of tho channe l at the inouth of the river. From Columbia river to San Francisco, a distance of over fjM miles, there is NO HARBOR ON OUR PACIFIC COAST w hich c an be approached during stormy weather An appropriation of 31a0,000 was made the forty-fifth congress for the commencement of a break water and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point between the straits of Fuca and San Fran cisco, at which the necessities of commerce, local and general, will lc best accommodated. The amount appropriated is thought to b. q iite inade quate for tne pmpoes lntenaeei. ine cost of the work, when finished, will le very great, owing to the want of natural advantages tor a site at any i oint on the coast between the designated limits7. and it has not been thought to Ik? advisable to un dertake the work without a larger appropriation. I commend the matter to the atte ntion of congress. The completion of the new building for the war department is urgently needed, and the estimates for continuing its construction are csjiecially rec ommended. The collections of books, snsnmsesni aud records constituting TIIE ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM AND LIBRARY are of national Importance. The library now con tains about fifty-one thousand five hundred (U, -500) volumes and fifty eevnn thousand (57080) pam phlets relating tu medicine, surgery, and allied ionics, i ii . contents oi me army meoacai museum unsit oi twentv-two thousand r.ooot specimens. and are unique in the completeness with which both military surgery and the diseases of armies are illustrates!, ineir uesiruction wouia re an ir reparable loss, not only to the United States bat to the world. There are filed in the record and pension division, over sixteen thousand Oii,o00i bound vol umes of hospital records, together with a treat quantity of papers, embracing the original records of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside fr- m their historical vulue. these records are daily s--arched for evidence needed in tlie settle ment ot large numbers of jK-usiun aud other claims, for the protection of tho government acainst at tempted frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable collections are now in a building which is peeiiharlv exposed to the danger of destruction by fire. It is therefore earn estly recommended that an appropriation le made for a new nre-prooi nuiiaing. adequate tor tne present nee ds ami reasonable future exuansion of these valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely ftre-pfoof ; no expenditure ior men' architectural display is required. It ie believed that a suitable structure can be erected at a cost not BO exeeed two hundred and fiftv thousand dollars ijfio.UOO). I commend to the attention of congress the great services of THK COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF OUR ARMIES during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did eg much Io bring that iiion:t ntous comesi io a close, ine legislation of the United H tales contalnsinany precedents for the recognition of disti . guishd military merit, ffiithor iring rank and emoluments to be conferred for emi nent services to the country. An act of congress authorizing the apjuiutinent of a c aptain-general Of the army, with suitable provisions relating to compensation, retirement, and other details, would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting unci proper, and would be warmly approved by the country. The report nf the secretary of the navy exhibits the successful snd salisfnetorv manage ment ef that department during the last hscal year. 1 be total expenditures fur the year wear werc SlJ. 916,638 tft, leaving unexpended at the close of the year $2,141,662 tt Of tbe amount of available ap propriations. The appropriations for the present fiscal year endlnsj June :w, lsl, ore l.o,."1ot;i r; and the total estimates forthe next fiscal vear end ing June SO, ls,j, are tlfr.tfft.'Wrl BL The" amount drawn by warrant from July 1. ISS0, to November 1.1860, is $.',Wl."'7o 4.". The reconimeudation of the secretary' of the navy, that provision la- made for ihe establishment of some form of civil govern ment for THE PSOPLE F ALASKA, is Approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that Territory. except such as is afforded by the officers of the United States ship Jamestown. This vessel was dtapatchecl to Sitka, because of the fear that, without the immediate presence of the national authority, there was im pending danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by lattli white aud Indian inhabitants, ami the neces sity for this method of restraint does not, in inv opinion, now exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, Wttboul the ordinary, judicial and admin lstrative authority of organized local government, serious consequences might ensue. The laws pro vide only for the collection of revenue, the protec tion of public property, and the transmission of the mails. The problem is to supply a local rule for a population so mattered and so peculiar in its origin and condition. The natives are reported to be teachable and self-.-'ippurtii g. and, li ptopeily instructed, doubtless would advance rapidlv in civilization, and a new factor of prosperity ujoukl be added to the national life. I therefore reeuin inend the requisite legialation upon this subject. The secretary of the navy has taken steps toward the establishment of naval coalliig-sUitioiis at the Islhmus oi Panama, to meet the requirements of our commerc ial relations w ith Central and South America, which are rapidly growing ir. importance. Locations eminently suitable both as regards our naval purposes, and the uses of commerce, have been selected, one cm the cast side of the Isthmus, at Chiriqui Lagoon, in the Ca ribbean sea. and the other on the Pacific e-oast, at the Itay of liolfito. The only safe harbors, sut flciienily commodious, on the isthmus, arc at those points, and the distance between them is less tliau 100 miles. The rejort of the secretary' Of the navy coneludmuldi valuable suggestions with re-siert to tho building upof our merchant-marine service, which deserve the favorable consideration of con gress. The report of the piwluiaster-general exhib its the continual growth and the high state of EFFICIENCY OF TIIE POSTAL SERVICE. The operations of Jno department of the govern - ment. perhaps, represent with greater exactness the increase in the is.pulation and the business of thecountry. In 1shj the postal receipt!- were S.- 51&.0C ;. iu lve the receipts were VS1VS1&,479 Si. All the inhabitants of the country are directly snd personally lnieresica m navmg pnujor man taciii ties, and naturally watch the peiatomce very' closely. This careful oversight on lhe)artc'f ; proveei a constant stimulus to improvement. Du ring the past year there was an increase of 0M lostoffices, and the mail ntutcs were extended ii7 . -177 saflea, making an additional annual transporta tion of io.beM.Ud miles. The revenue. of the postal sun ice h r the ensuing year are estimated at tst8, MSwTTf 16, and the expenditures $i2,47.',ftfj, leav ing a debciciicy to be appropriated out of the treasury of $ t,fsi0.7."7 uu. The Universal Postal union has received the accession of almost all the mtriesand colonies ol the world maintaining organized postal services, and it is confidently ex pected that all the other countries and colonies now outside the union will soon unite therewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the foun ders of the union, uf forming, for purpse of in ternational mail communication, a nngle postal territory embracing the world, with complete uni furmity of postal charges and conditions of ex change fur all descriptions of correspond cnee. To enable the United Mates io do its full share of this great W rk, additional legislation is asked by the siuinsii-i-gciiciiti. io uosc reeomiwenclulloti" eS- p. -rial attention is called. The suggestion of the jesttnaster-gemral. that It would Ti' wise to e n c.Hirage, by appropriate legislation, the establish ment ui American Uncs. ui bleamcrs by pur own citizens, to carry the mails between our own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America, anil of trans-Pacific countries, is com mended to tlie serious consideration of congress. The attention of congress Is also Invited to the sug gestions of the postmaster-general in regard to pos tal savings. The necessity fur addition provision, to aid iu the transaction of THK 

BUSINESS OF THE FEDERAL COURTS, Incomes each year more apparent The dockets of the supreme couit, and of the circuit courts in the greater number of tlie circuits, are encumbered with the constant accession of cases. In the former court, ami In many instances iu the circuit courts, years intervene before it Is practicable to bring cases to hearing. The uttoniey-general recommends the establishment of an intermediate court of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the numbered judges of the circuit court in each circuit, w ith the exception of the second cir cuit, should beiucreaaed by tho addition of another judge: in the second circuit, that two should be added j and that an intermediate appellate court should be formed in each circuit, to consist of the circuit judges and the circuit justice, and that in the event of the absence erf cither of these judges the place of the absent fudge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the circuit. Such an apiellatc court could be safely invested with lare jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors in many cases where appeals would still oo allowed to tho supreme court. The exionse Incurred for this Intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of the appropria tions for the expenses of the department of justice. This recommendation is commended to the care ful consideration of congress It is evident that n delay of justice, in many instances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now necessarily oe-curs in the Federal courts, which will in this way be reme died. The report of tho secretary of the interior presents an elaborate account of the operations of that department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that OUR INDIAN AFFAIRS appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made gratify ing progress in ;igrit nature, herding, and mechani cal pursuits. Many who w ere a few years ago in hostile conilict with the- government are quietly settling down on farms, where they hoia: to make their permanent homes, building houses and en gaging in the occupations of civilized life. The in troduotion of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and remunerative employment, and in stimulating their ambition to earn their own support. Their lionesn, fidelity, and efficiency as carriers ore highly praised. The organization of a police force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law and order uimu the reservations, and in exercising a whole some moral Intluoncc iimntig the Indians them selves. I concur with the secretary" of the in terior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased, as an inducement to the best class of voting men to enter it. Much care and at tention "has been devoted to the enlargement of educational fscilities for the Indians. - The moans available for tnis important object have been very inadequate. A few additional board ing-schotils at Indian agencies have been established, and the erection of buildings has boon begun for several more, but en Increase of the appropriations for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed to accommodate the large number cd" Indian children of school SfU. The number offered by their jm rent from all parts of the country for EDUCATION IN THE COVKRNMENT SCHOOLS is much larger ihan can be accommodated with the means at pro-cut available for that purpose. The nunilHT of Indian pupils at the Normal school at Hampton, Virginia, under tho direction of Gen eral Armstrong, has been considerably increased, and their progress is highly encouraging. The In dian school eamhHennd by the Interior department In HTfOj at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, under the direc tion of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful. It has now nearly pupils of both sexes, repre senting a great variety of the tribes oust of the KiH-kv Mountains. The pupils of both these insti tutions receive not only an elementary English ed ucation, but arc also instructed in house-work, agriculture and useful mechanical pm suits. A similar school was established this year at Forest Grove, Oregon, forthe education of Indian youths on the Pacific coast. In addition to this, thirty-six Indian bovs and girls were selected from the East ern Chcrokecs ami placed in boarding-schools iu North Carolina, w hore they are to receive an ele mentary English education and training In indus trial pursuits. The interest shown by Indian pa rents, even among the so-called wild tribes, in the education of their children is very gratifying, nnd gives promise that the remits accomplished by the eflbrts now making will be erf lasting benefit. The expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the permanent civilization fund at the disposal of the department of the interior; hut the fund is now so much reduced Ihut the continu ance i f this beneficial work will In tho future de pend on specific appropriations by congress forthe purpose, unci 1 venture to express the hope that congress will not permit institutions so fruitful of good results to perish for want of moans for their support. Ou the contrary. 11 inc reose (if the num ber of such sc hools appears to ate highly advisable. The past year has beeu UNUSUALLY FREE FROM DISTURBANCES among the Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes, by w hich they surrender their large reservation in Colorado in consideration of the annuity to be paid to them, and agree to settle In severalty on certain lands designated for that purpose, lis farmers, holding individual title to their land in fce.rimplo. Inalienable for ft certain period. In thfs way a costly Indian war has been avoided, which, aunne time, seemed imminent, and, for the first lime in the history of the coun try, an Indian nation has given up its triital exist ence to be settled In se veralty, and to live as indi viduals under the common protection ef the laws of the countrv. The conduct of the Indians throughout thecountry during the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions, haa been orderly aud n SOI mill I Tho guerilla warfare carried on for two vears bv Victorio and his band of southern Attaches has" virtually come to an end by the death of that chief and most of his EoUownsu, on Mexi can soil. The disturbances paused on our north ern frontier bv Sitting-Hull aud his men, who had taken refuge' iu the British dominions, are also likely to cease. A large majority of his followers have surrendered to our military forces, and the remiinder are apparently in musjuM of disintegration. I concur with the secretary of the interior in expressing the earnest hope that cougieps w ill at this session lake favora ble action on the bill providing for the allotmentof lands on the different reservations in severalty CO ihe Indians, with patents conferring fee simple ti tle Inalienable for a certain pertounnd the eventual disposition oi the resb.u- of tho reservations, for BBJSMWel settlement, with the consent and forthe benefit of the Indians, placing the latter unde r the autial rmtteetion of the laws of the country. This measure, with a vigorous prosecution of OUT educa tional efforts, will won the must important and ef fective advance toward the solution cf tho Indian problem. In preparing forthe gradual merging of cuir Indian population in the great IkkIv of Ameri can c'.tizenship. A large increase is reisu-ted in the disposal of PUItLP' LANDS FOR SETTLEMENT during the past war, which marks tho prosperous gr. at i h of our agricultural industry, an a vigorous movement oi population toward our nnoeeupled lands. As this mowment proceeds, the eodiiieation of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the disposirinn ol public lands, become of more pressing necessity, and I, therefore, invite the t onsidcration of congress to the report and the ae c rnpni-ying dmft oi a bill, made by the public lands commission, which were communicated by me to congress at the last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desirable. The- attention of congress is again usked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands, and the rapid and indiscriminate destruction of our lore si. The urgent necessity for legislation tothfsond is now gene rally recog nized. In view of tho lawless character of tho depredations committed, and the disastrous con sequences which will inevitably follow their con tinuance, legislation has again and again teen recommended to arrest the evil, and to preserve for the people of our western States and Territories the t'.inber needed fur domestic and other essen tial uses. The report of the director e.f the geological sur vey is a document of unusual Interest. The con solidation of the various geological and geograph ical surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which has heretofore operated upou an independ ent plan, withuut concert, cannot fail to be ol great beneiit to all those Industries of the country which depend upon the development of our mln oral resources. The lalrs of the scientific men. of recognized merit, who compose the corps of tho geological survey, during tne firM season of their field operations and inquiries, appear to have been very comprehensive, and will soon be communi cated to congress in a number of volumes. Tho director of the stincv recommends that the inves tigations, carried on bv his bureau, which, so far, have been confined to the so-called public-land States nnd Territories, be extended over the entire couutrv. and that the necessary appropriation be made for this purpose. Tnis would be particu larly beneficial to the IRON, COAL AND OTHER MININO INTERESTS of the Mississippi valley, and of the eastern and southern Suites. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of c ongress. The sccretary of the interior asks attention to the want of room In the public buildings of the capital, now exist ing and in progress of construction, for the accom modation of the clerical force employed, and of tlie public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in different parti of the city for the location of public offices, for which a large amount of rout is annually ptiid. w hile the separation of office s belonging to the same depart ment impede- the transaction of current business, Tlie secretary suggests that the blocks surrounding Lnfavette square, on tho cast, north and west, be purchased as the sites for new edifices for the ac commodation of the government otliccs, leaving the square itself intact: and that, If such buildings were constructed upon a harmonious plan of architecture, they would add much to the bonntj of the national capital, and would, together with the treasury and the neWsttte. navy and war de partment building, form one of the most imposing groups oi public eoanoesj ih tne srooo. ine com missioner of agriculture expresses the Confident belief that his efforts in behalf of 

TIIE PKODTJCTION OF OCR OWN BUOAB AND TEA have been encouragingly rewarded. Tho Impor tance of the results attained have attracted marked sttcntion at home, and have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of ourown tea. And the manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference of uuny millions of dollars annually iu the wealth uf the nation. The report 01 the e-omiulssioncr asks attention particularly to the continued preva lence of an infectious and contagious cattle-dis-easo. known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as eatlic-plaguc, or pleure -pneumonia. A mild type of ihisdiaeose, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of groat loss to OUT farmers, and ol serious disturbance to our trade with (iroat Brit ain, which furnishes n market for most of our live stock and dressed meats. The value of neut cattle exported from the I'nited Slates forthe eight months ended August 31, lUBU, was more than 

SU.WW.OOO, and nearly double the value for the same period in 1K7., an unexampled increase of export trade. Your early attention is solicited to this important matter. The commissioner of education reports a continued increase- of public interest in educstiotinl h Hairs, and that THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS generally throughout the country are well sus tained. Industrial training is attracting deserve -I attention, and colleges tot instruction, theoretical and practical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, including the government schools recently established for the instruc tion of the Indian youth, arc gaining steadily in public estimation. The commissioner asks sjKi ial attention Ut the depre dations committed on the lands reserved for the future &u pi tort of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the Territories and in the southern States. The recommendation heretoi'oremade is repeated and urged, that uu educational fund be set spait from the net proceeds of tlie sales of tho public lands annually, tho Income uf which, and the re mainder of the not annual proceeds, to ttc distrib uted on some satisfactory plan to the States ami Territories and the listrlct of Columbia. The success of the public schools of the District of Col umbia, and the progress made, under the intelli gent direction of the board of education and the superintendent, iu supplying the educational requirements of the District with throughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. The acts of congress, from time to time, donating public hinds to the several Slates and Territories in aid of educational interests, have proved to bo Srhn measures of public policy, resulting In great and lasting tenefit. It would seem to be a matter of simple juntos to extend the benefits of this legislation, the wisdom of which has been act fully vindicated by cxjari ienoe, to the District of Columbia. I agaia eonuuend the gene ral interests Of the Uistrict Of Columbia to the fa vorable consideration uf congress. The affairs of the District, as shown bj the report of the commit sioncrs, are in a wry saii-factory condition. In my annual message heretofore, uud iu my specie nits sage of Iecomlter 19, lSTt. I have urged upon the attention of congress the necessity of rec laiming the marsh of the Potomac adjacent to the capitel, and I am conatralned by Its importance to advert again SO the subject. These 11 it embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impedimin; to the drainage of the city, i;nd seri- usly impair its health. It is believed that, with this substantial improvement of its river front, the capital WwuMbO, in all respects, one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside boa its permanent population, this city is necosarllv uic (iisAv ui aiKit,ik.v ui vieuos unii ccjy SC- j nun ui uie eouiury, engageu in UN puoue Service. Many others reside here temporarily, for the trans action of business with the government- It should not be forgotten that tlie laud acquired will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it, and thatthe navigation of the river will be greatly im proved. I therefore again invite the attrrnffntl X congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much-needed and too long delayed im provement. 

TIIE WATER SL I'PLV c f the city is inadequate. In addition to the or dinary use throughout the city, the consumption by government is necessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the various departments, and a largo quantity is required for the persacg preservation uf the numerous parks aud the clean sing of sewers. 1 recommend that this subject re eetye the early attention of congress, and that, in making provision for an increased supply, such means be adopted as w ill have in view the' futuie growth of the city. Temporary expedients for such a purpose cannot but he wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities fur keeping it filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed. I cum mend again to tbe attention of congress the subject of the removal, from their present location, of the depots of the several railroads entering the city; and 1 renew the recommendations of my for mer messages in behalf uf the erection of a build ing for the congressional library: the completion of the Washington monument; aud uf liberal ap propriations in support uf the benevolent, reforma tory and penal institutions of the District.
