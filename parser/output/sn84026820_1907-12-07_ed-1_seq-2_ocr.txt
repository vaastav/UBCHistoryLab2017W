THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE The annual message of the President to the Congress is a most voluminous document, touching upon and discussing as it does, the many varied interests Mr. Roosevelt of the country, stands pat on his former utter ances on the leading questions prominent before the people. He stiU insists that the recent panic was not due to his talks, but due solely to the light thrown upon the dishonest practices of some of the multi millionaires in giving the water cure to stocks and other securities within their now control, and the consequent feel ing of dread engendered among investors aud prospective inves tors. It would probably be too much to ask for a careful reading of the message, but a study of the salient points will well repay those interested in good govern - ment. There is one point in the mes sage, however, that is of a vital interest to this community. That is the recommendation fora Federal inspection of grain en tering into inter-state commerce. Every evening tries to make fun of this proposition and says, that under such a system, it would be impossible for a Delaware farmer to sell his wheat or corn to a Pennsylvanian without the inter vention of a United States officer. This remark plainly shows the ignorance of the writer as to present conditions. As every farmer in Delaware knows, it is impossible now for him to sell a Pennsylvanian or for that matter, to a Delawarean, if the latter be a dealer in grain (and these lat ter buy practically all the grain that is sold in Delaware) without the intervention of an inspector, and that inspector an employee of the purchaser. It stands to reason that a seller will come nearer getting a square deal from a disinterested Federal official than from the present system, when, undeT certain conditions as to marketsupply and demand, it may be for the interest of the purchaser to have <\ lower grad ing than would ordinarily be the case. As a rule -the inspectors of grain are honest men but even honest men are swayed and must be swayed by the tone and tem per of their employers. No mat ter what else the present Con gress may do, and there is plenty of work mapped out for the mem bers, it should adopt this recom mendation of the President and quickly put grain and such other products of the farmer un der the same kiud of inspection and grading as is done for the manufacturers of beef and other animal products. The seal of the U. S. inspector fixes the quality and cons^ue&iiily-' the price of beef and pork. Let it also fix the quality of wheat, corn, oats, &c.D 

SHOPPING BY MAIL Everybody knows about the catalogue houses and other big establishments which advertise to do a mail order business. The theory upon which they proceed is to pick out a few articles ,of common consumption and sell them at wholesale prices per haps, or even less. If a popular copyrighted book is published they will buy them in large quan tities and put them on the market at their cost price, and this serves tyo purposes;- it . aids them in billing off the local dealers by showing a great con trast between the mail order house and the local' dealer. It also operates as an excellent ad ^vertising scheme. Seeing these ~ low prices upon articles which the people know about, they , readily conclude that the com pany advertising, these things so wonderfully low are selling everything on a correspoudingl-y low basis. . The next deceit is the quality of the goods. They ad vertise apparently the same art that your retailer does, at a lower _pr ice and soon they make the non-expert believe that ha bet ter buy all his goods of them. He proceeds to do so and actually pays more iu the,-end than lie would pay his local d ittfeFiu reg ular prices. These houses mate up much more on the goods which you do not understand than they lose on the goods you do understand, and by this process of bood-wink _ ing, retain your trade, teaV down the local.dealer in the small towns a decrease the value of town and adjacent country property, and you are doing it yourself. You are saving a few cents on a bar rel of salt and reducing the price of your farm by the act. Suppose you would only buy die bargains—just the goods that yot\ understand and know to be bargains. How long do you suppose the mail order house would do business? Not very !oug. Theyiey upon the bait which they set and it works in a -large number of cases to perfec tion. Barnum said that the American people delighted in be iug humbugged, that his show was i hegreatest humbug on earth and that was the reason he got such large crowds. We are always and because some one advertises one article for less than they are worth, that is no inference that he sells other articles for less than they are worth. In fact, the op posite inference is true, namely, if he sells one thing for less than it is worth, he must sell the next for that much more than it is worth to make up the loss on the first article, otherwise he would soon go bankrupt and out of business. By dealing with these great commercial centers we are centralizing a vast amuontof tradeat the expense of other cities and towus through out this beautiful country of ours. How- would we like it if there were no towns except the ones where the mail order houses do business? How would it effect the value of our property? All of us like to live near thriving towns and yet in many cases the people adjoining the towns whose financial standing depends upon the existence of the town, and whose land values are nearly twice as great because of its near ness to town are sending to Chicago for goods that are kept right here, and what is worse, they are getting beaten on every article bought, let alone the dam age done to the local dealer who is usually onei of the principal factors in keeping up the town. There is no logic, in the situa tion Your local dealers can furnish you your articles for one year as cheap or cheaper than you can get them in Chicago, be sides if you happen to get some thing you can't use, you can eas ily adjust it with your local deal er. We insist that the quality of the goods bought at home is in variabl y better than those bought in Chicago. You are all opposed to trusts, why help in building them up? That is just what you are doing by sending to Chicago for your goods. As we give the trusts our financial or moral support, we are creating masters for ourselves. Are we so mer ci nary that for the purpose of saving a few cents, we are will ing to hazard the future of our children. Let's have the patriotism and I h.e stamina to say that the inter est of our^liome town shall first be protected, and when we have done our whole duty by our lo cal interests we will find that we are worth more in dollars and cents than we are sending to Chicago for our supplies, and we will have retarded the progress of the trusts just that much. a looking for bargains that is all right. But - a a of To "A PANIC — — "We read in the newspapers about a panic now grasping the country, the "Roosevelt panic" some Democratic papers call it, and compare it with the Cleve land panic from '93 to '96. Well, we are not afraid to talk out about two periods, politics or no poli tics. They are always enough fuir and square people in -the land to pronounce honest judg ment on every man. "Wherq is this Roosevelt panic raging that we read about? This vyiter sold his wheat last Satur day for 99 cents a bushel, which however was a poor sale, the panic talk having got in a whack on our wheat pile, and the wheat crop of 1907 was a good one here in the east. Corn if in order will sell for 60 cents at home, oats have been as high as 50 cents. White potatoes are quoted at 65 to 70 cents. This writer sold his veal calves through the year at average of $13 or a little better and they were very ordinary calves at that Turkeys will briug 20 cents a pound, and our dresséd du cks from the farm sold in Philadelphia last week for 17 ceuts a, pound. How is that for a pamc? And who wiil lift his voice against us if we cry, give us more panics just like it. "Well, we were trying to do a little business during that never 1 to be forgotten period from '93 to '95. We rose early in the morn ing and lay down late at night, and about all we got out of it was thewear and tear «of living. We sold our tfheat as low as of of at -, '-V 57 cents ft bushel, and corn for 85 cents. We sold a ve**y good crop of bright oats one year for 20 cents a bushel. A good calf was worth $6, a nicely fatted turkey 10 or 11 cents a pound, a fat duck 8 cents. Oh, they were delightful days for the salaried man, and we shook him right and shook him left about it, and still he cried the louder, "Grover, Grover, four years more of Grover." Well we got the four years, those of us who survived them. In that day the song was first sung in the land "down the street to the soup house" and "over the hills to the poor house" and still the capitalist and sala ried men picked the cheep turkey out of their teeth and shouted "no fifty cent dollars for us." "Undoubtedly four or six weeks ago in the present year, this country looked in the wide gaping mouth of as ugly looking a panic as ever opened its jaws to devour the business of a land. Everything seemed to be ad justed to it. The country banks had their surplus money in the city banks,and the city banks had it out in every form of specula tion. When like a clap of thun der in a clear sky, the people sud denly arose and rushed to the banks for their deposits. No hurrying and scurrying among the banks could have withstood this assault, and the country seemed doomed to fall like a tree broken down by its fruit. Then it was that Roosevelt rushed to the scene to put the fire out. No red tape restrained him from bring ing the great wealth and credit of his government to stay the conflagration, and it stopped. The people saw and believed that the man could and would protect them, and confidence regained its feet. Yes he offered to issue bonds, but bonds to save the people, and unlike the Cleveland" bonds that were issued to save the Government "Bryan would doubtless have done the same. The two men are not wide apart, waiving party lines. But narrow is the man whatever his politics, who does not thank Theodore Roosevelt to day for the prospect of a winter of ease and abundance, if our Blessed Lord and Father so per mits. And whenever the shadow of a panic spreads otiits ghastly form over this land, Roosevelt if President may be depended on to do to it what he did to the panic of 1907 .''—Delaware State Netcs.

December 5th.—Residents of Reboboth report that there has not been as much wild game in Reboboth bay and its, tributaries for \ ears as is at present there this season, and coin-e quently the chance for sport is the best for tome time. Frank L. Chase, freight agent at Reboboth, and for years a regu lar visitor to the bay for wild game, is authority for the statement that it is there in abundance this Beason. Quite a number of visiting sportsmen are there already, and doubtless the news of so much chance for sport wiil soon spread and Reboboth will be overrun with the sportsmen who have enjoyed shooting ducks aud geese from the blinds at various places in the bay. The law lies stepped the shooting of game from steam launches, which was getting to he such a fad that it was a menace to the sport. Catalog of Music
