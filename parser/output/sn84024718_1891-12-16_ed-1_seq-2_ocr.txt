WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16th, I Ml. _ — So Occasion lor War- President Harrison's rather aggressive, not to say menacing, tone in dealing with the Chilian question in his message to Con gress has called from the Chilian Minister of Foreign Affairs a.circular letter to the legations of that country in Europe. The New York Herald of tho 13th inst, publishes this document, and says of it that, "in a less bellicose spirit than that of the President's message it claims that the Chilian side of the matter has been mis represented, not only by sensational de spatches to the jingo press, and especially London papers, but also by official state ments sent to Washington. There is no telling what may result from this unfortunate controversy if either side acts rashly or obstinately. But there is no necessity or occasion for a breach of the friendly relations between the two coun tries, and there will be none if common sense, moderation and patriotism prevail on both sides. Controversies of this kind are common.— We have had several with China. We bave had them with Great Britain and Spain. We now have one on hand witb Italy. Ail have been amicably settled ex cept tbe last, and that is on the highwaj to settlement. .There is no reason why the present Chilian dispute should prove ar exception. Chili oan well afford to make an apology to the United States and offer to pay an in demnity, and its government will aot un wisely if it fails to do so. Under the cir cumstances it can take this course grace fully and without any sacrifice of national honor or dignity. It can justly and witb credit disavow the Valparaiso affair, be cause, in the language ot Senor Matta's ciroular to the Chilian legation abroad, it "took place in a bad quarter of tbe city, the 'maintop of Valparaiso,' and among people who are by no means models of dis cretien and temperance;" and becanse at that time the nation was without a per manent government, the people were ex- Pand a condition of affairs bordoiiog taking this wise course Chili would ie following the example set by the d States. When China called us to account for tbe Chinese outrages in tbe West our government deprecated their oc currence and volunteered an indemnity,— So also Italy was informed that the gov ernment deplored the New Orleans out break, and was given to understand that Congress wonld provide for an indemnity if justice demanded it. While it would be a mistake for Chili no' to take this coarse, it would be equally nn wise for the administration at Washington to enter upon a rash policy which might in volve the country in war. It is to be re membered that Chiii bas been racked by internal war, her government overthrown, her people harassed. Ii) is also to be re membered that in her struggle she bad much ground for real or fancied grievance against the United States. Our Minister was an unconcealed partisan of the hated Baimacedan regime, against which the people rose in aims. Onr Legation wa. turned into an asylum for supporters of the overthrown dictator. Oar naval force there, as tbe Chilians complainod, did not maintain that strict nentrality demanded S.tional law and courtesy. Finally, ;ealcus seizure of the Itata was illegal acd unwarranted by our iary. Ie all this does not justify or ex ttack on the men of the Balti le streets of Valparaiso. But it d good reason why the present y should be conducted with n, patience and magnanimity, i wise course be pursued it can lead to a settlement satisfactory able to both nations, r Mr. Harrison or Secretary the republican party may feel, believe that the American peo enjoying the blessings of peace, and oontentment, are eager to unnecessary war npon a small pnblic at tho imminent risk of jto serious trouble with one or jpean Powers. President Harri io himself more credit and the i greater service by successfully ith the issue diplomatically than g the matter before Congress in special message." GOV. McKINNEY AND THE 

OYSTER Interest.—On Wednesday last, the 9tb inst., Gov. Mclvinney sent a special mes sage of somo length to the Legislature on the oyster interests of the State. The message is accompanied by a bill, the passage of which, tbe Governor thinks, will effectually protect the oyster interests and largely increase the State's revenues. Tbe Governor thicks "the hope of tbe oyster i: Virginia is in tbe planter, who should be offered reasonable inducements, because he produces and protects." Governor Mc- Eincey says tbe Legislature should not pass any law which violates the compact entered into by the State of Maryland and Virginia on the 28th of March, 1785, or any existing laws of either States, "but if on consideration, the Legislature deem it best tbat any of tbe agreements existing between the States should be repealed or modified, there should be a conference asked, and such action should be taken a. will be best for tbe interests of both States." West Virginia's World's Fair Build ing.—Mr. Wm. N. Chancellor, one of tbe World's Fair commissioners for West Vir ginis, says tbat tbe plans sbow up hand somely and give a comprehensive idea of what the representative building of tbat State will look like at the World's Fair There wil' be ample room in the building, and all the apartments are conveniently ar ranged. On tbe first floor there will be two spacious parlors on either side 33 by 34 feet. Tbe verandas on either side wi) l have a radius of 23 feet and 8 inches. There will also be two committee rooms on tbr first floor, 12 feet 4 inches by 12 feet 6 inches. There will also be spacious ball ways, alcoves and toilet rooms on tbif floor. On the second floor there will be a large assembly hall, 33 fret by 77 feet and 4 inches, and two committee rooms and several smaller apartments. The building throughout is most conviently arranged. Tbe wife and infant obild of Albert Cole man, colored, Vicksburg, Miss., were asleep batuiday nith', wben some un known person entered ibe bouse and poured molten lead in ber ear and spattered a large quantity of it on tbe child. Tbe woman's ear is burned out mid rb<> physicians tbink she will die. Tbe child is terribly burner), bat may recover. STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND GENERAL ADVERTISER — Optimistic Message.—The Baltimore Sun says that there is a fine flavor of political optimism, not to say a tono of self oomplaoency, pervading the whole of tbe President's message, and that in view of the fact that within a few months the national convention ofthe republican party will assemble, and that a few months later the presidential election will take place, the message is undoubtedly a olever and ingenious production. It is not unjust to say that both those events were clearly present to the mind of the writer. It is an elaborate attempt to show that there can be no possible jastification for a change of administration when everything is going on so nicely and the whole country is pros pering under the present Executive. It is a plausibly-urged bid for a renomination — a cleverly-conceived campaign document for tbe republican party. -»- •_■--» Suit foe Heats- Damages.—The Rock bridge News says that the Peyton Camp bell company, proprietors of the Rook bridge Alum Springs, bave brought suit in the Circuit Court against the Virginia Iron and Railway Company for failing to run their cars over the narrow gango railroad from Goshen up to the springs, as they had contracted to do.

R. Sheppard, an old gentleman seventy years of age, living at Lowmoor, lost his life on the track at that place about three o'clock last Saturday week. The old gentleman was crossing the track, which is a double one, in front of a train. In order to avoid a train he stepped from the track he was on, but only in time to be struck by an engine on the other, which he did not see. He was in stantly killed, his skull being badly crushed." Arm Amputated.—The Greenbrier (W. Va.) Independent says that on Thursday, the 3rd Inst., "Mr. John Hedrick, of Irish Corner district while clearing the sawdust out of the pit of a saw-mill while the same was running, accidentally threw his left •inn against the teeth, which so badly lace rated it that amputation was necessary.— Dr. C. W. Miller, of Alderson, performed the operation, taking tbe arm eft above the elbow. Mr. Hedrick is a young man, about 25 years old, acd is a son of Mr. Sam'l Hedriok, who lives near Fort Spring depot." ._ j m Horrible Tragedy. A few days ago, Mr. Frank Paokwood, who lives in Florida between Smyrna and Oak Hill in Florida, about' 7 miles from each, went to Orlando, and in his absence all the members of bis household were horribly and brutally murdered, some being shot in the bead acd others having bad their throats cut. This horrible scene of murder was discovered at 10 o'clock on Saturday morning. Tbe murdered were Mrs. L. D. Hatch, formerly of Maine and her younger son, Miss Adalaide Bruce, of New York oity, and Frank Packwood, Jr. Great excitement prevails, and hundred* are seeking the murderer. It is hoped bs will be found and summarily dealt witb. Location of Courthouse Changed. The Courthouse of Pocahontas county, W. Va., will in future ba at tbe new town ot Marlinton instead of Honlersville, as heretofore, the question having been settled by popular vote, with about three-fourths of the vote in favor of the chauge of loca tion. The new location is more central than the old, and it will be an important paint on the projected railroad. Now there will ba a boom at Marlinton and prop erty will go up, and speculation will be rife, and some will make and others will lose. Those who own property there now will be greatly benefitted. •- *-B- ♦ A dispatoh to tbe Fredericksburg Star reports the killing of Camden Sadler in Middlesex county Monday of last week.

While Sadler was in the act of striking him with a stick Parks shot him the abdomen. 9 —♦ ■ A Romance in Real Life.—A romance in real life became public in Tacoma, State of Washington, a few days ago, wheu Wil liam Lurty, clerk of the municipal court, was quietly married to Lucy H. Lurty.— Once before, away back In Virginia, in the year 1878, these same parties were united in marriage and three children were bore to them. The marriage proved unhappy, however, and in 1887, one year after their coming to Tacoma, they separated by mu tual oonsent and were divorced in tbe dis trict court, though Mr. Lurty continued to provide for the mother and children and was an occasional visitor at their home. — Last April Mrs. Lurty and her children re turned to Virginia. They stayed but four months. Returning to Tacoma, they were established in a snug home on the hill pro vided by Mr. Lurty, and the marriage last Friday reunited the family. Mrs. Lurty was Miss Lucy Davidson, daughter of the late James G. Davidson of Rockbridge oounty, Va. They resided in Harrison',nr_; for a nnrn ber of years, during wbich peri d Mr. Lur ty was cleik of the U. S. District Court for this District.
