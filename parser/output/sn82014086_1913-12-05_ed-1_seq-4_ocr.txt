Tt is a magnificent response which is being- made to the appeal issued by the Connecticut Agricultural college and the state board of education for the destruction of the tent caterpil lars which have done such a tremen dous amount of harm ahout the state and are prepared to greatly increase it unless their presence Is opposed by some united effort. Trees over large sections of the state were completely denuded of foliage the past summer through the unopposed activity of this pest. The idea of interesting- the chil dren In the gathering and destruction of the egg masses provides competitive work for nimWe hands to do. The need of It and its value is recognized by the action of individuals and or gardzatlons In offering prizes for those who destroy the largest number. The greatest benefit from such an onslaught on the tent caterpillar is hound to be felt In the Jollities where they have heen allowed to make such Inroads and naturally there are the places where the most effective work can and must be done. There should be the determination, however, in all sections of the state to eradicate this destructive nuisance, whether the nests are to he found In large or small num bers. Just as valuable work is to be don for the community by ridding it of Its few hundred nests as for the gathering of many thousand where they happen to be plentiful. Wherever a tent caterpillar nest is seen it should be dw4royed. Better results can he ac eotnrlistied today than six months or a year hence. BOSTON'S Fl RET RAP. Tt Is with commendable speed that TUaston has set on foot a number of investigations as the result of its dis astrous Are. It has required a fright ful loss Of life to disclose and bring to th attention of the Boston au thorities ttie exact situation in the cheap hotel and rooming house dis trict. The revelations of the fire are sufficient to indicate that plenty of effort m-uwt he used and perhaps addi tional legislation secured in order to prevent such an awful tragedy from recurring. It is made plain that such places as poor men are inclined to seek for lodgings In Boston are ver itable firetraps. The unfortunates were hemmed In without a chance for es ca.pe. This calls for a regulation of the building and fire laws which will pre vent Bt, recurrence of such conditions. It is not at all nrobahle that the Ar cadia Is the only place of the kind wherein hundreds of lives are endan gered every night Because of the exist ence of the sajne Inadequate provisions against protecting the lives of the lodgers. Not only must Boston take up the question with a view to es tablishing better conditions for that class of men hift it must look care fully to the necessity of fire preven tion, Kven thoug-h the investigations disclose no violation of existing laws as to "buildings and fire protection the heavy loss of life is sufficient to bring to an end any chance for repetition, A rfcasohafcle degree of safety should he reqoired ven in the. cheap lodging house. THE PHILIPPINE POLICY. "When President Wilson declared in his message that "We must hold steadily In view their ultimate itvde pendens in reference "to the Philip pine Islacufls he nly maintained the same position which was assumed by his two predecessors. It has always been declared that the Filipinos should have . their lnd-ependenoe when they were fitted to properly gwem ttveea selves, hut it has ien maintained that they should not he cast adrift HJitfl that time has arrived. The pol icy has been that independence should not he guaranteed to the Is J and s at a fixed data regardless of th pro gress which they have made or are likely to make imier oar direction. That tiiey are not ready to g-uide their own destinies alone ig perfectly aparent at the present time and there is no reason to believe that they can reach that point at a time which should be decided now. Th ultimate independence is the gpal whicb must he worked par. oojoer it can be reached the better 4i wfil please this ootrettry, hut it cannot be improperly hastened. Tbds it is believed has '-been made particularly plain to the -president by the eminent athoriLes: who knw the conditions and the rate of tsets Uij-e, ,&ad - who hay i-vea their pinions concerning: their ac quaintance with the facts. His atti tude on the Philippines is that of caution and it ie a particularly sen sible stand which he has taken. 

DEATH FROM AUTOS. The killing- of a young- woman In Derby by an automobile Just after she had alighted from an electric car is another instance of the lack of care on the part of the drivers of auto mobiles. By the state law no auto should attempt to pass a car which is stopped to leave or receive passen gers at a speed greater than three miles an hour. Had such regulation been observed in this instance there was no reason why the machine should not have been stopped in time to avoid the trolley car passenger, who had be come confused by suddenly finding her self threatened by the auto. No one should have been in a better position to have controlled the situation than the driver of the auto, who must have seen the stopped car and expected someone to leave or get on the car. The passing of electric cars which are stopped for the convenience of the public is dofie with none too much care by the auto drivers, even though the streets may be narrow. Instead of a disposition to stop and allow, the people to get to a position of safety the same as would be done by most any other vehicle, the inclination is to urge and hasten the people until the natural result is confusion. It was but recently that complaint was made that there were too many laws concerning the auto, but it might have been better said that there are too many auto laws which are neither respected nor enforced. The deaths from autos are growing instead of de creasing. This is a condition which should be reversed. MONEY FOR MILITARY OPERA TIONS. The political contest which has been stirred up in France over finances and war preparations concerns a matter of international interest in view of the efforts for international peace and the reduction of large expenditures through the declaration of a "naval holiday." The bone, of contention in Franco was the proposed war loan of $260,000,000 with the attendant ques tion of taxation upon such rentes, and the anticipation of an increase in the income' tax. Even though the action meant the resignation of the French ministry it must be considered in the light of reflecting the demands of the country for a curtailment of expendi tures for military purposes. This is in accord with a widespread feeling in European countries that such expenditures are being made out of all proportions to the demands. It is this race in war preparations which has Inspired the demand for economy in both England and Germany' and re sulted in the proposal that those lead ers refrain from naval construction for a stated period. Thus they would hold their relative positions without pouring in many millions more through costly competition. It is France's ef fort to keep up with the leaders which has heen defeated. What may be the outcome of all this agitation for the elimination of waste ful expenditures remains to be seen but it is apparent that there is a growing feeling in that direction among the bigger nations and it is not im probable that it will result in time in the securing of some relief. EDITORIAL NOTES. It is up to congress to demonstrate whether the "Hetch Hetchy Is a quick step or a glide The democratic platform calls for one term but the president is willing to leave that to the people.

BULLETIN'S SPECIAL YALE LETTER Suggestion For Thanksgiving Game Not a New One New Announcement on Junior Promenade Festivities In terest in University Union Most Successful Financial Football Year Baseball Schedule. New Haven, Dec. 4. The question of putting off the Yale-Harvard foot ball game until Thanksgiving day that has been raised in the past two weeks and has had considerable discussion, is by no means a new one. As far back as 1892, the matter of playing on Thanksgiving day was getting atten tion, when Princeton was the oppo nent and the abandonment of the hol iday may have been the consequence of a spirit which is still felt by some and was expressed in those .days by this letter to the Yale News of Dec. 1. 1S92: "Give up the Thanksgiving game, boys, and give up playing any game in ew York. You may not, like the advice, but it is good for you all the same. Thanksgiving day ought to be left to maintain its character as the day of family reunion. Whatever breaks it up does a real Injury to society. Thee are days enough besides for football.'-' The writer scored transportation fa cilities in New York 20 years ago and praised Springfield as a place to play. "Play your game in a place that you can reach and leave with nineteenth century convenience. Play,' too, in a town where the newspapers next day will not proclaim every decorated drunkard to be one of you students." The issue is raised now, of course, because it is felt that the two hard est games of the season are too close together and should be separated by more than one week to let the team get back its full playing strength. Following a large number of stren uous protests Dean Jones has at last consented to modify the heavy restric tions placed -upon the festivities of the junior promenade by a recent an nouncement. The dean has decided that it will be permissible to have guests arrive on Sunday, February 1, instead of on Monday as first an nounced. Then the sophomores, junior and senior Germans Monday night are given an hour's longer lease of life, their end being postponed from 3 a. m. until 4.' But the Prom, itself on Tues day night gets no concessions. 'Qt must stop at 4 o'clock and no break fasts or dawn teas will be permitted either morning. Due to the changes brought about by the new semester plan of dividing the college year, it will be the shortest Prom, at Yale in a good many years. A committee was appointed by the Yale Alumni advisory board at its meeting in June, 1913, to consider the advisability of establishing at Yale a University union similar in aim to Harvard union and Oxford union. Chairman George A. Sanderson, '85 has made an announcement this week. The committee, which comprises be sides Mr. Sanderson, R. C. Mallard Thruston, 'SO S- Frank L,. Bigelow, '81 S; Jonathan Barnes. 8o and Ed ward B. Greene, 1900, is getting in formation from Oxford and Harvard and from the deans of the various de partments of Yale, as well as the views of the undergraduates. The report of the committee has not yet heen for mulated, but our work thus far has led us to believe that there is a wide spread and genuine interest in the idea of establishing a union at Yale. The probable cost of the land and build ings would be $500,000. Everard Thompson of the Yale ticket department judges that the sea son in football just closed has been one of the most successful, , from a financial point of view that Tale has ever had. Beginning with the Wes leyan game in September. Mr. Thomp son finds that the attendance steadily increased, the Brown game attendance falling a little ' below the past two years, because Brown did not send quite as many men to the game. The attendance was about 10,000 on a rainy day. For the Princeton game the stand capacity, 33,000, was sold out, and at the Yale-Harvard game the attend ance was the largest ever reported at an athletic event in America, nearly 48.000. The gross earnings of the two championship football games, cal culated from the capacity of the stands at New Haven and Cambridge, would be about $160,000. or $80,000 for each university. From this amount came large expenses for the maintenance of the Yale athletic plant so that the net earnings from the two games would probably not run over $.15,000. The maintenance of the big wooden stands at Yale field, Mr. Thompson said averages about $12,000 yearly, about half for lumber and half for -labor. When the new howl is completed, the iipkeep of the stand will be entirely eliminated. The net earnings of the minor games, Mr. Thompson believed, were not over $4,000, due to low ticket prices and the season ticket privileges of the students. Twenty-six games are on the sched ule of the university baseball team, made public this week by the man agement. This is five less than last year. The team starts on its usual southern trip on April 8, the first game being with the Norfolk, Va., club on April 9th. Mt. St. Joseph college at Norfolk, the University of Virginia and the Catholic viniversity are play ed at Norfolk. On April IS, return ing north, the University of Pennsyl vania will he played at Philadelphia. The season at New Haven opens on Wednesday. April 22, Yale against Co lumbia. On Saturday, April 25, the team goes to Brown at Providence and the next 14 games will be in New Haven, except the first Holy Cross game on May 16, and the first Cornell game on May 23.

Steiner of Hartford, to be followed by the usual Alumni dinner. Accommodations for returning medical school alumni are to be made, and it is intended to have an exhibit in Memorial hall of books and instruments illustrating the devel opment or American medicine in the last 100 years. A request for funds to finance the celebration is also to be sent to the alumni, who are urged in responding to remember that they will not be called upon for another hundred years.

New Haven Times Leader. The "Safety First" campaign is es sential. If the automobilisls would regulate their driving so as to make for safety rather than for speed, they will have less need to fear for the safety of children in the streets. The campaign should be statewide. At the same time, all local authorities should lose no opportunity to warn parents of the dangers that surround chil dren who are permitted to play in the streets. Waterbury Republican. People who have endeavored to make a study of the sewage question are not surprised at the trouble in Nor wich. It comes in a new form, how ever. Heretofore the complaint has been because of odors or damages to land, but in this case the water is unfit for manufacturing purposes. This is further evidence of the fact that cities must provide a method of sew age disposal, other than turning it into streams. There can be no escape from it. New Britain Herald. Bridgeport's city departments have been permtated with politics from time out of memory, and this is necessarily true under our bipartisan system of appointments to office and subordinate positions under the municipality. The system would possibly work properly if fitness for place always received the same consideration that is given to party services. This could be arranged by the establishment of a civil service list of eligibles from which partisan appointments could be made. Bridge port Standard. EVERY DAY REFLECTIONS Discontent.

If they take any one of many things and do it with all their hearts they will attain a considerable measure of success, perhaps even a very great measure of success. Whatever the work may be, it will present its difficulties, its dark days, its hours of weariness and conflict; these are to be faced by all. Persons of this general adaptability are the most liable to feel dissatisfied, unless J the adaptability oe tnat or spirit as well as of faculty. They think they could have done better in some other line than that in which they are now engaged; they are mistaken in this thought they might have done as well, but no better. Resolutely combated, the mood of discontent is likely to pass; new pos sibilities of development will appear in the present course and perhaps a permanent gladness. Instability is always weakness. and nothing is gained by running from one thing to another.
