We have made dancer ts corrective treatment will remain un tnswered. THE CUBAN INSURRECTION. The insurrection in Cuba still continues With all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress hus thus far been made towards the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the con­ siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least' two-thirds of the inland country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesitating devo­ tion of largely increased military and lAval forces to the Jask, there is much reason to believe that the insur­ gents have gained in point of num­ bers, character and resource, and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb, without prac­ tically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an inde­ pendent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on. the pretence that civil gov eminent exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does I fc .'ep on foot such a government,, more or imperfectly, to be controlled at all times by, invisiblo at pleasure, and that •an abiding faith in the agencies estab- fights only from ambush, with all the ad lisbed for the direction of the affairs or yuntages of position and numbers on its their government. Thus our people ex- 8itlc it would well afford me satisfaction if 1 could assure the con­ gress that the disturbed condition in Asi­ atic Turkey had during the past year as­ sumed a less hideous and bloody aspect, and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demand of humane civilization, or as the result of decisive action, on the part •f the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere for the protection of (those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry cruel fanaticism,the shocking features «f the situation had been mitigated.

Were the Spanish armies a bio to meet their antagonists in open or pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the immense superior­ ity of Spanish forces in numbers, discip­ line and equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns real engagements that can choose and does choose its own ground that from the nature of the coun ty is vis- In a country where all that is in­ tfispcnsible ci„thing in life in the way of food, and shelter is so easily obtaina- ble, especially by those born and bred on tKo soil, it is obvious that thei'e is hardly a limit to tiAe during which hostilities' of this sort may be prolonged. Mean­ while, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of tho contestants grow more and more in (lamed and excess on both sides becomes more frequent and more deplorable. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable, liut while such seemed to lie the original policy of the Spanish government, it has now appar­ ently abandoned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents, namely, that the exigencies of tho contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that it may not prove of use and advan­ tage to the navy. It is to the same enil that in pnrsuance of general orders, Spanish soldiers are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to1 con­ centrate itself in the towns. The sure re­ sult would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast diminishing-and that unless there is a speedy and radical will soon in oxistiiigconditions it diaai*)Car ait„gether. Tho spectacle of utter ruin of an adjoining country, ty naturo one of the most fertile on the globe, would engage the serious attention of tho government and the people of the United States in any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly senti­ mental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to a» to be: hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is sec­ ond only to that of people of government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated thHt at least from £30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital is invested in planta­ tions, and in railroad, mining, and other business Interprises in the island. The insurgents aro undoubtedly en­ couraged and supportod by the wide­ spread sympathy the people of this country always and instinctively feel for every struggle for better and freer gov­ ernment and which in the case of the more adventurous and restless elements, of our population leads in only too many in­ stances to active participation in the con­ test.

WEEKLY TBAKSCB1JP\V LITTLE FAJLL4, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, DEC. 11, 1896 neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dic­ tates that right and not might should be the rules of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a necessity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers, and desires nothing so much as to live in am­ ity with all the world. Its own ample end diversified domains Ihtisfy all possible longings for territory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of covetou^eyes upon neighboring regions, however attractive. That our conduct towards Spain and herdominioris has con­ stituted no exception to this national dis­ position is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far during tho present insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Yam in 1868. No other great powej, it may be safely said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested tho same restraint and the same patient en­ durance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States towards Spain in connection with Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They view with won­ der and admiration the cheerful resolu­ tion with which vast bodies of men aro sent across thousands of mile3 of ocean and an enormous debt accumulated that tho costly possession of the gem of the Antilles may still hold its place in the Spanish crown. And if neither tho gov­ ernment nor the ^people of the United States have shut their eyes to tho course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the existence of conceded grievances which have led to tho present revolt from tho authority of Spain, griev­ ances recognized by the queen regent and by the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic aiul enlightened of Spanish statesmen without regard to party and demonstrat­ ed by reforms proposed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish government. It Is in the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications of in­ fluential public opinion in Spain, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife, with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects ol the insurrection. 

SPAIN SHOULD GRANT AUTONOMY. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba geuuiuo autonomy—a measure of home rule, which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish sub­ jects—there should bo no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the re­ sources of the island and making it worthless for whichever party may ulti­ mately prevail. It would keep intact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather than impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its inhabitants within their own con­ trol without severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self govern­ ment under the most favorable condi­ tions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise au­ tonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their amua on the othen side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, i. insulli*ient without assurance- of the promise being fulfilled. Realizing that suspicions nodi precau­ tions on the part of the weaker of two combatants are always natural and not. always justifiable—being sincerely, desir­ ous in the interest ef both as weUi as on its own account that the Cuban problem should be-solved with the least possible delay—it was intimated by this govern­ ment to the government of Spain, some months age-that if-a satisfactory measure of home rule wero tendered the Cuban in­ surgents and were accepted by themuupon a guarantee of its execution, the United States would* endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guarantee. While no definite response tg tliis- inti­ mation has yet been received from the Spanish government, it- is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as al­ ready suggested, no r«ason Is penoeived why it should!not be approved by the in­ surgents. Neither paaty can fail to. see importance of early actfcan, and bot&must realize that to»prolong the present state of things for eveaui short period will addenor mousty to the time and labor and expen­ diture uecess-wy to bring about thcindus trial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped, on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines-above indicated may be at once inaugurated and pushed, to-aa.imme­ diate and successful issue. The friendly offices of the United States either in the manner above- outlined, or In any other way consistent with our constitution and laws, will always be- at the disposal of either party MAY BE 

FORCED- TO ACT. Whatever circumstances may arise our policy and our interests, would, constrain us to object to the acquisition of the isl and or any interference with it3 contro). by any other power. It should bo added' that it cannot be reasonably assume*, that the hitherto expectant attitude ct the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to ao cord all due respect to the sovereignty ct Spain we cannot view the pending con­ flict in all its features and properly ap­ prehend our inevitably oiose relations to it and its possible results without consid­ ering that by the course of events we- may be drawn into such an unusual and un­ precedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way or with our friendly co-operation. When the inability of Spain to deal suc­ cessfully with the insurrection has be come manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its re establishment has degenerated into a strife which means more than the useless sacrifice of human llie and the utter de­ struction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superceded by higher ob­ ligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and meth- should not be determined Qpon without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor and interest, or the international duty we owe to Spain. Until we face the contingency suggest­ ed or the situation is by other inoidents imperatively changed, we should contin­ ue the line of conduct hitherto pursued, thus in all clroumstances exhibiting pur obedience to the requirements of public law and onr regard for the duty edjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations. A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an un­ due stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remihd the congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests as well asa regard for the interests of nations and their citizens joined by considerations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related to us, saved from com­ plete devastation, will constrain our gov­ ernment to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved, and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhab­ itants an opportunity to enjoy the bless­ ings of peace. 

VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY. Tho Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference be­ tween Great Britain and the United States, their respective governments hav ingagrecd upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela, submitting the whole contro­ versy to arbitration. The provisions of tho treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezula thereto may confidently be anticipated. Negotiations for a treaty of general ar­ bitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and promise to reach a success­ ful consummation at an early date. RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1890, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to $409,4.75,40B. Dur­ ing the same period its expenditures were $434,678,634.48, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting to $25,203, 245.70. The ordinary expenditures during the year were $4,015,852.21 less than during the preceding fiscal year. The operations of the marine hospital service, the revenue cutter service, the lighthouse service, the bureau of naviga­ tion and other branelies of public work attached to the treasury department, to­ gether with various recommendations con­ cerning their support and improvement, are fully stated in the report of the secre­ tary of the treasury, to which the atten­ tion of congress is specially invited. ARMY HAD LITTLE TO DO. The limit of OUT military force as fixed by law is distantly and readily main­ tained. The present discipline and mor­ als of our army are excellent,, and marked progress and efficiency are- apparent throughout the entire organization. With-the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight Indian disturb unces-along our southwestern boundary, io which the Mexican troops co-operated, and. the compulsory but peacefiul return, with the consent of Great Britain, of a Vliand.of Cree Indians from Montana to .the British possessions,, no active opera­ tions have been required of the army dur­ ing the year past^ 

COAST FORTIFICATIONS. Daring the past yearrapid progress has been made toward the completion! of the schema adopted for the-orection of fortifi­ cations along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made-in providing the material for submarine defense inaconnec­ tion with these works. POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. Our postoffice department is in good condition and the exhibit made oS its op­ erations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, if allowance is made for imperfec­ tions in the laws applicable to iti, is very satisfactory. The total receipts: during the year were $83,499,208.40. The total ex­ pend! tures were $90,626,296.84. There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or7sl per cent and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,-124.02 or 4.4S per sent. The deficit was $1,679,986.19 less than than that of the preceding year. There should be a small addition to the existing inspector service, to be employed in the- supervision off the carrier force, which) now numbers 13,000 men,, and per­ forms its service praatically without the surveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public service. Of course such a lack of supervision and freedom from wholesome- disciplin­ ary restraints must inevitably lead to imperfect service. There should also be appointed a few inspectors who would assist the central office in neeessary in­ vestigation concerning matteus of post office- leases, postoffice sites, allowances foe-rent, fuel and lights, and tai organiz iagrand securing the best results from the work of the 14,00d clerks now employed in AESC and second ojkass offices. THE PENSION ROLL. The diminution of our- enormous pen­ sion roll and the decrease of pension ex peoditure which have been so often confi­ dently foretold still fail in material real­ ization. The number of pensioners on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30,1896, was 970,6-78 This is the largest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for the pensions during the year was $1381214,761.94, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expenditures on ac­ count of pensions, including the cost of maintaining the department and expen­ ses attending pension distribution amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within a very small fraction of one-third of the en­ tire expense of supporting the govern­ ment during the same year. The number of new pension certificates issued was 90, £41) Of these 40.974 iepresent original al­ lowances of claims and 15,378 increase of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pen­ sions from the United States but residing in foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the payment of pensions for the cxirrent fiscal year end­ ing June 30,1896, is $140,000,000, and for the succeeding year it is estimated that the same amount will he necessary. The commissioner of pensions reports that during the last fiscal year 835 indict­ ments were found against violators of tho ods until the time forv action arrives, we, pen8ion laws. Upon these indictments 167 should make them depend upon the pre- convictions |nd much other Information and obser­ vation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep into our pension system h»ve ilone incalculable harm in demoralizing our people and undermining good citizen chip. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pen­ sion roll and make it what it should be, a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of their country's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who pose as the soldiers' friends, active and alert in urg­ ing greater laxity and more reckless pen­ sion expenditure, while' nursing selfish schemes, I have daprecated the approach of a situation when necessary retrench­ ment and enforced economy may lead to an attack upon pension abuses so deter­ mined as to overlook the discrimination due to those who are worthy of a nation's care, ought to live and die under the pro­ tection of a nation's gratitude. THE PACIFIC RAILROADS. On January 1,1897, with the amount al­ ready matured more than $13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy bonds issued by tho United States in aid of the con­ struction of the Union Pacific railway in­ cluding its Kansas line and more than $6,000,000 of like bonds issued in aid of the Central Pacific railroad including those issued to the "Western Pacific railroad company will have fallen due and been paid or must on that day be paid by the government. Without any reference to the application of the sinking fund now in the treasury this will create such a default on the part of these companies to the gov­ ernment as to give it the right at once to institute proceedings to foreclose its mort­ gage lien. The consideration requiring ail adjustment of the government's rela­ tions to the companies have been clearly presented and the conclusion reached with practical uniformity, that if these rela­ tions are not terminated they should be •revised upon a basis securing their safe continuances. Therefore, unless congress shall other­ wise direct, or shall have previously de­ termined upon a different solution of the problem, there will hardly appear to ex­ ist any reason for delaying beyond the date of the default above mentioned such executive action as will promise to sub­ serve the public interests, and save the government from the loss threatened by further action. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The progress made in civil service re­ form furnishes a cause for the utmost congratulations. It has survived the' doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent place among tho agencies destined to cleanse our politics and to improve, econo­ mize and elevate the public service. There are now in the-competitive classified serv­ ice upward of 84,000 places. More than half of these have been included from time to time since March 4, 1892. The civil service rilled as amended dur­ ing the last year provido for a sensible ami uniform method o£ promotion, bas­ ing eligibility to better positions upon demonstrated efficiency and faithfulness. Thre absence of fixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more and more apparent as its other benefits have been better appreciated.. The ad^van­ tages- of civil service methods in their business aspect»are- too welL understood to require argument. Their application has become a necessity to the executive, worh of the government. But those who gain positions through the- operation of these methods should be made to under standthatthe nonpartisanschemethrough which they receive their appointments de­ mands them, by way of resiprocity non­ partisan and faithful performance of duty under every, administration, and cheerful fidelity toevery chief, while they should.be encouraged to decently exercise their rights of citizenship audi to support through their suffrages the political be­ liefs they honestly profess, the noisy, pes­ tilent and partisan employe, who loves political turmoil and contention, or who renders lax and grudging service to an administration not representing his polit­ ical ^iJws,. should! be promptly and fear­ lessly dealt with# in such away as to fur­ nish awarning to others who may belike wise disposed. INTERSTATE COMMERCE. The- interstate- commerce commission has, during the last year, supplied abun­ dant evidence- of its usefulness and the importance of tile work committed to its charge: Public- transportation is a uni­ versal necessity, and. the-qjoestion of just and reasonable- charges: therefor has be­ come- of vital importance, not only to shippers and carriers, but also to the vast multitude of producers' and consumers.

Whatever may be it9 shortcomings as. a complete measure of tariff reform, it resulted. ... ,, ciselonditious tUeu existing, and they ir my opinion such statements as these year of its operation it has yielded neai-ly men. mi. Life/« »ust he conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater 98.000,000 more revenue than was received! from tariff duties in the preceding year.1 There was, nevertheless, a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a littlei more than $25,000,(XX). This, however,! was not unexpected. The situation was such In December,, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury foretold a deficiency of $17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in business circles and the de­ pression in all activities intervening since that time resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its operation seri­ ously checked the imports we would have otherwise received, and readily accounted for the difference between this estimate of the secretary and the actual deficiency, as weli as for a continued deficit. Indeed it must be confessed that we could hardly have had a more unfavora­ ble period than the last two years for the collection of tariff revenue. We cannot reasonably hope that our recuperation from this business depression Will be sud­ den, but it has already set in with a prom­ ise of acceleration and continuance. I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in the near, future yield a revenue which, with, reasonably economical expenditures will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no de­ ficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit we have in the treasury, in addition to a gold reserve, $100,000,000, a surplus of more than §12$ 000,000 applicable to the payment of the expenses of the government, and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not extrava­ gantly wasted, must in any even^ .be per­ verted from the purpose of its exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its proper and legitimate use. It is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appropriations and extravagant expenditures. I suppose it will not be denied that under the present law our people obtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper sate than formerly. This is a matter of su­ preme importance, since it is the palpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possi­ ble. The people should not be required t® relinquish this privilege of cheap living except under the stress of their govern­ ment's necessity niaxle plainly manifest. THE. 

FINANCIAL QUESTION. This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally sug­ gests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the atten­ tion of congress in previous executive communications, and the inevitable dan­ ger of their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these de­ tails I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the- necessity of the prompt re­ form of a system opposedt to every prin­ ciple of sound finance, and shown by ex­ perience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible civil war,, which shook the foundations of our government more than thirty years ago, brought in its tniin the destruction of property, the wasting of the country's substance and the estrangement of brethren. They, ara now past and forgotten. Even the- dis­ tressing loss of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred memory, which, fosters pat­ riotic sentiment and keeps- alive a tender regard for those who nobly died. And yet there remains with u» today, in full strength and activity, as an incident oi that tremendous struggle, a feature ef its financial necessities not only unsuited. to our present eircunistancesysbut manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever present agent of monetary distress.' Because we may been joying^a tempor­ ary relief from its depressing influence,, this should not lull us into a false secur­ ity, nor lead us to forget the suddenness of past visitations. Lam more convinced than-ever-that we can.have no assured financial peace- and safety until the government currency ob­ ligations upon which gold may be de­ manded from the treasuny are withdrawn from circulation and cancelled. This might be done* as has been heretofore rec­ ommended, by their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by their redemption, with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the United States notes, known as greenbacks, were thus retired it xs probable that the treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the act of July 14,1890, now paid in gold when demanded,, would not create much dis­ turbance, as they might from time to time, when received in the. treasury by redemp­ tion in gold or otherwise^ be gradually- This plan of issuing bonds for the pui pose of redemption certainly appears to be the most effective and direct path te needed reform.
