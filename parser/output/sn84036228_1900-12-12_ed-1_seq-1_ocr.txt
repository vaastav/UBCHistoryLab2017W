REPUBLICAN IN POLITICS, AND DEVOTED TO THE MINERAL, AGRICULTURAL, STOCK AND WOOL INTERESTS OF THEGREAT JUDITH COUNTRY, REIIEW OF THE PAST YEAR President McKinley's Annual Message to Congress Deals Largely With the Chinese Complica tion, the Philippines and With Immediate Necessities. "To thie .enaHte and ll louse f Re |presen tat iCes: With the outgoln', o' the old and the Incoming of the new century you begin the last session of thie Fifty sixth congr, ss with evidences on every hand of individual and national pro. sperity and with proof of the grow ing strength and Inereasing power for good of republican institutions. Your countrymen will join with ylou in felicitation that American liberty Is more firmly estnalilished than ever before and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more univwrsal than at any period of our history. The republic was never so strong, because never so strongly entrenched in the hearts of the people as now. The constitution with few amend- Inents exists as it left the hands of its authors. The atdditions which have been Imatde to it proclahn larger free domn and more extended citizenship. Populargoverniment hasdemonstrat ed in its one hundred and twenty four years of trial its stability and security and its ellicieney as the best instrument of national developlment and the best safeguard to human rights. When the sixth congress aseallmbled in Noveimber, 1Y)I, the popiulation of the I'|dted Sttltes was 5.:11)I4:1. It Is now 76,:;01,71:1. iThen wteh:au lltates. Now we have 4.).

Attention Ii called to the efforts mnide by this governnent in the direction of mliin taining the intetgrlty of the' Chinese empire and ending the aaomnalous situation that now exists there by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possielble moment. After re ferring to the Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the Im perial government in Pekin and Its acceptance by this government, the message says the administration has held for effective reparation of the wrongs we have suffered and an en during settlement that will make their recurrence Impossible, which can best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences and obeys. "While dolng so," the message continues, "we fore go no jot of our undoubted right to Co to A. Hopkins I Sons.

The mait ter of Ildemnlity for our wronged eit Izens is next touchlied uponl, which, the presilent says, is of grace con cern.

The Nicara guan canal is also touched upon and to the senate is commended the con ventln with Great Britain tofacilate the construction of such a canal and to remove any objection which might arise out of the convention called the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. Attention Is called to the surplus revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900 and the deficits that formerly existed. The expenses of the government were materially re duced during the past fiscal year. "It will be the duty, as I am sure it will be the disposition of the congress to provide whatever further legislation is needed to Insure the continued par Ity under all conditions between our two forms if metallic money, sliver and gold," iN the recomnmendatlin to flnacial legllation.
