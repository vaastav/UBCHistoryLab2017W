Washington, Dec. S. — The Supreme Court de cided to-day the habeas corpus cases of nfoyer, Haywood and P»ntibone. the representatives of the Western Federation of Miners, who ar« held In prison In Idaho on the charge of complicity in the murder of ex-Governor Steunenberg. ad versely to the men. The opinion was by Justice Harkii. The effect of the decision -will be that the mer will continue to be held in confinement for trial in Idaho. Charles H. stayer la president W. P Haywood ssi ssiiiij trnnsnrnr and George A. Pettibone a member of the Western Federation of Miners. They are now in prison In Canyon City, Ida., under a charge <>f murdering ex-Governor Steunenberg of that state, although it was not charged that they were present when the crime was committed. The cases came to the Supreme Court on an appeal from a decision of the Idaho federal court refusing to grant writs of habeas corpus. The principal point of controversy was the method by which the Idaho authorities secured Jurisdiction over the men. All of them are resi dents of Colorado, and it was alleged on their behalf that they were kidnapped, in pursuance of a conspiracy, to which the Governor of rado and the Idaho authorities were parties, and hence that Jurisdiction was acquired by fraud. Justice Harian said that in the habeas proceedings in the United States courts tha method of the extradition of the defendants was BOt material. The merits of the cases were not Involved, as that phase was not prosecuted. The only question there involved was the right of the state courts to proceed with the cases, of which there could be no doubt. Justice JfcKenaa delivered a dissenting opin ion, holding that Mover, Haywood and Pettibone had a right to Invoke the aid of Che federal orrect improper methods in securing their extradition. He «aid that kidnapping under the law Is no 'fled than when performed outside the law, where every effort of authority is used to prevent and punish it Announcing his decision that th" United States Circuit Court had Jurisdiction in the habeas ■ or pus proceedings. Justice Harian aa Looking first at what was aileged to have oc curred in Colorado touching the arrest ncr and y from that state. Chat anything done there, however hastily at Inconsiderately done, can be fed to be in violation of I ■■tution ■ rnor of thai state haVi to demand pr yond that contained in the extradition papers, and said: Hla failure 1 i fugi . urded as un in fringement of any right of the petitioner under the Constitution or laws of the United s - He also said that even if there was fraud in een no vio lation of righ's under the Constitution. H-- on- tinued: It is true, as contended by the petitioner, that if he was not a fugitive from Justice within the meaning of the Constitution, no warrant; for his arrest could have been legally Issued by the Governor of Colorado. [1 is equally true that, even after the issuing of such a warrant before his deportation from Colorado, it was competent for a court federal or state, sitting in that state to inquire whether h* wt», in fact, a fugitiv* from justice, and. if found tot to be to dis charge him from the custody of the Idaho agent and : reveni his deportation from Colorado. No obligation was imposed by the Constitution or laws of the United States upon the agent of Idaho to bo time the arrest of the petitioner and so conduct his deportation from Colorado as to afford him a convenient opportunity, before some judicial tribunal sitting In Colorado, to test the question whether he was a fugitive from justice and as such liable, under the act of Congress to be conveyed to Idaho for trial there It cannot be contended that the Circuit <'ourT. sitting in Idaho, could rightfully discharge the petitioner upon allegation and proof simply that h« did not commit the crime of murder charged against him. His guilt or Innocence of that charge is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Idaho state court. The question in the court below was not whether the accused was guilty or Innocent, but whether the Idaho <-ourt could properly be prevented from proceeding in the trial of that issue upon proof being made in the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting In that state, that th.' petitioner was not a fugitive from justice, and not liable, in virtue of the Constitution and law;-, of the United States, to arrest tn Colorado under the warrant of its Governor, and carried into Idaho. After reviewing the antecedent decisions, ho announced that the principles -t forth in them ■'require an nffirmanr" of the judgment ol the Circuit Court." He .said. In conclusion: Any investigation as to the motives which in duced action by the Governors of Idaho and Colorado would be improper as well as irrele vant tn the real question to be now determined. It must be conclusively presumed that those officers proceeded throughout this affair with no evil purpose, and with no other motive thurt to enforce the law.

As nearly as could be learned last night the box containing the giant powder which exploded stood not far from the bottom of the shaft and toward the land side.

Platt and Depew in Their Seats — President Sends in Nommatioitt — Resolutions on Case of Negro Troops. f?*r*>TTi the Trfhun» Bonatn-l "Washington. Dec. 3.— Precisely at noon to-day the gavels of the Vice-President of the United States and the Speaker of the House fell in the chambers over which they respectively pre side, and the short session of the 59th Con grass came to order. There was the usual throng of visitors in gallery and corridor, the usual handshaking and congratulation on the floors, the hum of conversation which in both bodies rose like the echo of a great reception, and then all was silence save for the voices of the chap lains, who pronounced the usual brief prayers. All the morning the Capitol had been the Mecca of strangers in Washington, while Con gressmen from the four quarters of the Union steadily wended their way up. Capitol Hill, many coming afoot, some in streetcars and a few in carriages. Many of the visitors remained outside the big building for a while, watching the arrivals, but the strong west wind and over cast sky made outdoor observation unpleasant, and as the floors of the two chambers gradually tilled up the gayly dressed crowd, composed largely of women, thronged the galleries, where many were unable to secure seat?. Only the most formal business was transacted in the two houses. It had been agreed that the House should adjourn out of respect to the mem ory of the four members who have answered their last rollcal! since the previous session ended, the reading of the President's message being deferred until to-morrow. Th© Senate transacted only the business essential to con vening. About 1 o'clock both houses adjourned until to-moi IN THE 

SENATE. Considerably before noon, members of th 9 Senate began to gather in their chamber, and immediately groups were formed in which the results of the election, the political situation in the various states and other topics were dis cussed Senator Platt was early in his seat, and the Vice-President, looking taller and straightor than ever, who followed the aged Senator into the chamber, went forward and welcomed him back to Washington. A few moments later Sen at or Depew came in. and was immediately sur rounded by his colleagues, who congratulated him on his appearance and the evident recovery of his health. Senator Aldrtch entered the chamber Just behind Senator Foraker, and the two immediately engaged in an earnest conver sation. Senator Spooner went over on the Dem ocratic side and chatted with Senators Black burn. Daniel and others. As' Senator Crane en tered the room some one remarked: "Here comes the bridegroom.' ar.d the Senator from Massachusetts blushing!? accepted the congrat ulations which were showered on him. Senator Allison was particularly missed, but Tie Is ex pected to return in a few weeks. Just at noon the Vice-President called the Senate to order and Chaplain K.xT« made th* prayer in the presence of ar. almost full cham her. a decidedly unusual occurrence.
