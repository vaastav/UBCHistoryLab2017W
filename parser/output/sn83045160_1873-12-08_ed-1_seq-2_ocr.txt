The Meeting was composed of our best citizens, Tomnmt and Republicans for tbe nonce forgot their past differences, and struck hands in a patriotic uetermina tton to lift our municipal election out of the mire of politics, and to organize a people's party, with the sole aim or in augurating'that honesty and economy in thA Htv irovernmeni wnicn is so essential to the prosperity of Mem- Tihis. After a careful comparison of opinion, it was evident that Mayor J. J, Busby was the choice of the people, and he was unanimously nominated. Jttaa this meeting, which represented so well the worth and intelligence of Memphis, deliberated for a month, it could not have hit upon a better ticket Major Busby is a cool-headedj far-seeing and enterprising business man, who will do unselfish work for the good of "the city, and who is tavwise to be duped and too honest to cheat He merits the f onfidenoe and support of every man whose heart is in the welfare of Mem phis. He will infuse hearty life into the municipal government, send some fresh, strong blood pulsating through its arteries, and infecting every inch of its life. He comprehends the needs and opportunities of Memphis. His ad ministration will be broad and compre hensive, giving our city a fair chance for growth and prosperity. It was hoped that such a candidate nominated by the people would be elected, just as Boston, Chicago and other prominent cities have elected their mayors without reference to party politics. But it seems the professional Radical politicians of Memphis care more for party than they do for the material interests of the city. "While the people, irrespective of party associa tions, are consulting the b t interests of the public, the political aacks, who manipalate the Radical party, have called a political meeting, and will meet to-night for the purpose of nominating a party candidate for mayor and other municipal officers. The meeting -will, no doubt, be rich and racy, tumultuous and uproarious; but the surging crowd to-night will be very much like Automatons, the moving springs of which will be controlled by a few very threwd and clever manipulators. There will, no doubt, be disagreement as to how the machine should be worked, and for which there will be a pretty little "laarrel; but a-s usual, they will settle their differences of opinion without re course to interference from outside- the charmed'circle of the rings. The pro gramme for the meeting to-night is al ready cat and dried, and the convention will have nothing to do but to register the edicts of the m sharp and dar ing schemers Tvho furnish the party 'with opinions and orders, and who crack the party whip over the backs of those who doubt the infallibility of the party sagamores. One thing in the approaching election is certain: the Radical party will be unit in support of the ticket to be nomi nated to-night This fact should con striidste the people of Memphis in sap- lvort of the people's nominees. It should induce everyvoter who fedis an interest in the future prosperity of Memphis to sacrifice on the altar of public good all prejudices. It should arouse the peopl to the deep sense of impending danger. It should induce all, old and young, Republicans, Democrats and Conservatives, who desire the prosperity of Memphis, to clasp hands in fraternal concord. Surely if ever Memphis was in need of aid from her true citizens. now is the time. Naturally 'there has been some complaint at the 'action ol the late mass-meeting,as there is at every nominating meeting; but after the ac tion of tbe Radical convention to-night, these murmurings will Te hushed The question will be asked from one end of the city to the other what are mere men, however great and noble they may be, as compared with the triumph of the people and the pros perity of a great city? To-morrow morning the people will present a united front ready for the battle. Our candi dates are in the field, and our banners are already advanced. Let each soldier look to the center, and move forward The battle may be fierce, but the victory is sure. Be true, people of Memphis,and the setting sun on the first of January will witness a signal victory, the complete rout of tliose who cry party! party! in munici pal elections, and array race against race, color against color, black against white, and who care nothing for the fu tiire prosperity of Memphis, so they can get office and fat contracts. THE IlIlillT WAX. An attempt is being made to convert the pending canvats for mayor into a contest wherein the party most voluble in abuse and fertile in intrigue, is to win the game that it is to ne purely a rough-and-tumble fight among the poli ticians. We ask the' people of Memphis, the respectable, non-politicians and non-office-seeking citizens, to turn from this disgraceful attempt at an exhibition of partisan strife and cor ruption, which would stop at no means however questionable that promises success, io the .position occupied by Major J. J. Busby as a candidate for mayor of this city. A respectable business man, he comes at the call of a mass-meeting of his fel-low-citizena, and modestly accepts the nomination. He presents himself before Uie people not urging any other claim to office than a desire to serve them and a modest belief in ills competency to ac complish the object He is not trying to undermine the reputation of any man, not endeavoring to foment ill-will. and engender malice among his fellow-citizens; not promising one thing to one man and a different thing to another; not endeav oring to make theworseappearthe better reason, nor "wire In arid iwlre6u',' in order to make votes; but quietly re maining at his home, or his place of business, awaiting the indorsement of uie sounu, soDerjuagmentiOi jnsxenow citizens, If they desire him (.To ict a . .... r- . . i e, tneirpuDiic servant, certainly the ft? speclable people of Memphis should deem even these traits good ones in a gentleman aspiring to become their chief magistrate. Has not the time ar rived for the people to indorse a private citizen as against tbe-wire-pulling poli ticians? Is it not time to put in practi cal operation that theory, fio-often ad vanced since the burial of tbe old issues, that the people must rule? Is the mayoralty of Memphis to be setup as a prize for political blacklegs lo "win or lose by the chances of a disreputable game? We tespectfully solicit the people to look to their truainterests and to the fair fame of Memphis, to save the city from tbe politicians, and elect a man their mayor who belongs to no ring,:Is the covenant tool of no party, i and who will honestly and efficiently administer the affairs of the oltv?or tho P general, prosperity fitj& classes of .her citizens. rUEMESSAGEATIIOMEANlAIIKOA Theiost importaSEfetate paper of the times, the President's message, has now iwv,n i 1ib hands of our people for several davs. They have uau time to read and digest its various parts, and to conclude that, after all, General Grant means well, however clumsily he may illustrate his meaning. The country likes well the language of tbe President in the matter of the steamer- Virglnius and his treatment of tne Cuban question generally. His recommendation in fa vor of specie resumption is also accept able, though he seems as much at a loss as the secretary of the treasury as to viodus operandi of resuming. It gratifying to find that the great finan cial nerve Wall street remains Intact alter reading the President's Quixotic plan for rectifying our currency on the elastic-rubber theory without fpecial basis. We learn that the message had no effect In checking the movement for a rise in stocks and securities in the metropolis, The impression prevailed among leading financiers that no ac tion would be taken by congress'ori fhe wild-cat scheme of the President, un favorable to the business interest of the country. We learn, too, that the panic has been at an end for some time, though we in Memphis have not yet f jund it out, if scarcity of money be any evidence of that fact Confidence iu Wall street is entirely restored and investment orders are larger than they have been for months. the out-of-town buyers being very numerous, we are advisee that people who sold out their holdings at a sacrifice, and hid their money away, now discover that they are unable to re place their stocks and bonds at the fig ures at which they were disposed of. Served them right. Such men, if they do not create, generally aggravate panic Wall street shows many new fices. In place of the old financial wall-flowers, new men, eager to build mi prices, with all sails set and a fair wind blowing, are seen on every, curb stone. The lunch-rooms and restau rants are. doing a land-office business and men discuss stocks aud bonds over oysters and Bass ale, soft-shell crabs and gin-punches, with a gusto more eloquent of the absence of any panic than any other proofs that could be improvised The advices from foreign countries, too, are cheering. From Iiondon they are of the most favorable nature, the market being strong and prices sustained. The war news from Havana, exaggerated as such news generally is, had for a while a depressing effect in Wall street on Saturday, but it did not last an hour, and a sharp advance took place in all kinds of stocks. The financial outlook, then, is brightening, and with the Christmas holidays we may look for the inception of better times ., times when money ia. easier and iu the condition that Barkus wished Pegotty more "comfortable" than at present. But how was the mes sage received in England? Why, the great thunderer, the Tone, the organ of the -aristocracy, criticises General Grant's document rather sharply. The Hrnes does not like the excessive privi leges in regard to freedom from search which the President claims for vessels bearing the American flag, and contends that "such preten sions" would confer immunity on an open pirate. The Times is sensitive on this question of the flag protect ing the deck over which it floats. It is reminded, doubtless, of the war of 1812, when, to enforce this "pretension" we gave the British navy a taste of the efficiency of our men-of-war. The Jupiter Tonans of the English press is also dissatisfied with the suggestion of the message to pro hibit national banks from paying in terest on deposits, and like ourselves, does not agree" "with the President's ifinancial remarks generally, and be lieves him wrong in attributing the recent financial troubles to the peculiar character of the currency. The Times says, with a spice of London Punch, that the Presidential advice to return to specie payment-would be more satisfactory, if he had told the country how to do it But it bestows praise on the moderate tone in general of the message on the Cuban question, and announces the gratifying fact that England will unre servedly supporl'a policy which requires that Spain must really, as well as nomi nally, control Cuba. The Daily $etvs and Daily Telegrapli both' speak friend ly of the message, but the Standard frownsand grumbles a little at the Presi dential threats against Spain. On the whole, the effects of the message at home and abroad have been salutary

FOURTH GIFT CONCERT Of Fntllc Library or Kentucky. A CAItD TO THE PUBLIC m , X HE Trustee,! of the Public Library of Ken tucky and the management of the Gift Con cert, announce the postponement of the Fourth (Jlft Concert until Tuesday, the 31st of March next. The public will readily understand the causes which have made this postponement necessary. The financial panic, which has for the last two months paralyzed the business of every section of this country and of Europe, has prevented thousands from inventing iB ticket . The epidemics pervading almost the entire .South have cut off a large and valuable mar ket. And, too, the public, Judging from the effects of these caused, have expected a post ponement, and have declined to Invest with out a more potltlve assurance of tbe drawing taking place on a fixed day. All Interested desire a mil drawing, but for tbe reasons Just stated this could not be bad on tbe 3d of December, but the short post ponement now announced will secure IU The management have met with unprece dented success. The sales of tickets, the pro ceeds of whloh have already been received, amount to ovxxa siillio.n dollars, with a number of agencies In this country yet to hear from, and all those In Europe. Thus a drawing (scaling the gifts one-half) could be bad now, but the management deem It best to have a postponement and a tull dbiwimg. This postponement assubes the sale or ALT. THE TICKETS AND A FULL DRAWING. That this determination will meet with the approbation of nearly every one Interested Is made apparent by the very numerous letters received from every section of this country and tbe Canadas asking for a postponement. This action of the management will work no detriment to any, but will be,forthegocd of all. By It the fortunate ticket-holders will receive their gifts in full, while it will not aflect those who do not draw gifts. In making this announcement the manage ment EMPHATICALLY STATE THAT THEKE SHALL BE JCO FCKTHEK POSTPONEMENT, and to this end all agents will be Imperatively required to cloe up and transmit their ac counts to this office by the list of Slarch.
