A primary election law which will re tore the power to the ha nils ot the people, where It belongs. . A non-partisan commission of three or Ave to have charge of our school and Institu tional lands, and the permanent trust funds derived therefrom. ' 8. A fair, adequate and Just tax law which will equitably distribute the burden of gov ernment. We have especial reference to the mining tax laws, although we will seek to reach any other evaders, big or little, whom we find. We favor a mine tax law based upon an ad valorem property bails, ua other property Is taxed. 4. A fuller budget system for the state In an effort to put Mate expenditures on an effi cient, economical and progressive basis. gardlcss of how the highest tribunal of the state ecides the matter. Despite carping criticism the Journal has taken a consistent stand against the pardoning of thesis men by Ciovernor Larrazolo. As soon as the first rumens that the governor was contemplating such an action were heard, the Journal registered its protest; whereas its critics, who charge the Journal with being lukewarm in its censure o the pardons. were careiul to wait either through mejc nr cour nge or of vision until the American Legion had expressed itself In the matter before Voicing any opinion. The record is there: it speaks for Itself. The early editions of the Journal had already left the press, carrying a protest against the pardons, when the resolution of the American Legion was received in the Journal office. ingRhijniQS Welt Mason THE DKI.INQl'EXT TAX LIST. LET IS HAVE PE Yd It is to be hoped that the mine owners of New Mexico will see this wisdom of acquiescing in the report of the Special Revenue Commission concern ing the ad valorem taxation of their mines, with an expert assessment. , Certainly no injustice can come to them from such a program. 1 they do not. want the "best of it" thry should have no objection to being taxed on the same basis as everybody else. If tlu-y feel that others are escaping with under-cvaluation they should join hands with those who wish for justice and should aid in bringing about a public senti ment which will compel everyone to consent to an equitable distribution of the tax burden by es tablishing a system of professional assessments. To reason that they are justified in seeking under assessment because some others do so is to argue that "two wrongs make a right." All honest men want to pay their exact pro portion toward the expenses of government. Ef forts to escape taxation are usually predicated on the theory that others are not paying their just share and that evasion is merely self-defense against getting "the worst of it." No one should bi asked tq bear more than his just burden. But the remedy lies in aiding in the establishment of a system which will compel equity instead of adding to the break-down of justice by also becoming a "tax-dodger." Every man should be willing to accept a full evaluation on what he has. Public sentiment should then require an exposure to public ignominy of tax evaders as severe as that visited upon draft evaders. Only so can a state of public opinion be created which will demand a square deal. Such a law for mine assessment as is contem plated should be surrounded by all necessary pro tection against injustices, such, for instance, as the right of uppeal to the supreme court. With such protection the big interests really have the better of the little fellow for the amounts involved are large enough so that the cost of their appeal is inconsequential while the cost of appeal to the small man Is prohibitive. That Is the price most of us pay for being poor. If the mine owners will approach this prob lem with a sympathetic willingness to do right they will find plenty of co-operation in seeing that justice is done them. Their unwillingness in the past has brought on nil their troubles. The attacks of the Journal on these interests in recent months has been based upon their arro gant assumption of the taxation functions of the stato and their determination to fix their taxes to suit themselves. Neither capital nor labor can presume to be bigger than the state .without invit ing a fight from those who believe that the au thority of the state is supreme and that the rights of all of the people are paramount to the j wishes of any few. It is highly desirable that class issues be avoided' and that no part of our people be arrayed against . any other part. Wo wish "the lion and the lamb to lie down together." But we are unwilling that when they do so the lamb should be in the stom ach of the liun. They must lie down on equal terms. The Journal denies that it is an inciter of prejudices when it combats any other basis of agreement. Permanent peace must be based upon justice. We propose to have that kind of peace even if we have to fight for It. If further public censure of the mine owners is fomented by the Journal it will be the fault of these gentlemen and not of the Journal. The Revenue Commission, created ut the mine-owners' request, has pointed the way to a solution. The people ac cept their suggestions. Will the mining men do likewise? Public sentiment at this moment rejects the theory of the "penalization" of mines in taxation and adopts the "equity" theory. It the penalization theory ever prevails in New Mexico it will be the penalty of an arrogant defiance of public sentiment. Wo believe the men who direct these great In terests now see the wisdom of dealing frankly and equitably with the people. We sincerely hope so. The law providing for the publication of Uio delinquent tax lists is nothing short of legalized graft. As long as the law provides that these lists must be published annually any newspaper will accept them, of course. That is legitimate. It is claimed that this law was pssaed as a political sop to the newspapers and has been main tained by a newspaper lobby. We do not know its history, but we do know that it works a most unconscionable hardship upon the taxpayers of the state. For instance, the publication of the delin quent tax list in Guadalupe county this year cost that comparatively poor county $7,500. It there are newspapers in the state which openly demand tho continuance of such a system will they please speak out so that people may know who they are? If they dare not demand it openly they should be ashamed to demand it secretly. While wo do not know what influence backed the passage of this law we do know that it was not sound, economical administration w hich suggested it. Let the newspapers of the state show themselves above petty personal advantage at public expense, by joining in demanding the repeal pf this ridicu lous law. Any paper which is rendering decent public service can find a way to struggle along without this somothing-for-nothing perquisite. We should be consistent enough to part with our own special advantage against public interest, while we aro demanding that others part with theirs. CANNED MCSIC. When 1 am tired and weedy, and feeling all my years, and beaten down by greedy and beastly prof iteers, to ease the fret and fever I wind the phonograph, and soon forget the cleaver, the harpoon I and the gaff. Oh, you may stand anil mention h hundred iirofintm I boons, but here's the great inven tiontion, this mill that plays me tunes! I hear the world's great singers, in song that flows and swells, and they are surely dingers, and they are wearing bells. I hear Caruso thunder, he makes, my soul rejoice; and Journet tears asunder the welkin with his voice; and Hc'mbrieh sings divinely the air she's deigned to pick, and Oalli cuiii finely makes nightingales look sick. And there are humbler singers who chant the dear old hymns, and they are ever bringers of briny to my glims; and there's a band a-crashing the bars of "William Tell," with, energy so slashing that 1 rear up and yell. If si. me one stole my auto I might in grief repair to some soquestered grotto, and do some weeping there. And sorrow would be reigning upon my darkened brow, and I'd be beard complaining, i someone swiped my cow. But I would cease to chortle, and ne'er again I'd laugh, if some blamed soulless mortal should lift my phonograph. Efficient ' " Q r fT s via busekej&pio, ANSWERED LETTERS. TALKING IT OVER. President-elect Harding already Is demonstrat ing his spirit of co-operation in the management of the government's affairs. According to a dispatch from Washington, the senator Bpent Monday at the cVpitol, conferring and consulting with his sena torial colleagues as well as with other officials who will share tho cares of stato with him. Despite liis limitations or is it because he real izes them? Senator Harding well knows that no one man can run the United States of America single-handed. It is only by patriotic, self-effacing co-operation that any great Institution can be managed. If ever performer, wants tho spotlight, a confusing glare results. Only in the proportion that each musician knows how to blend his contri bution to the scheme of the whole composition, can an ideal symphony be produced. Reader-Friend: "Can you tell me of something that will clean black satin slippers?" Answer: Use gasoline, rubbing a little of it on the slippers with a cloth. Take cue not to use gaso line near heat or flame. L. M. D.: "Please give me re cipes for quince jelly and candled orange peel and citron." Answer: Quince Jelly Wipe off the quinces and cut them into small pieces, rejecting the seeds and cores. Measure these small pieces and to one quart of them add I pint of cold water, . putting both fruit and water in the pre serving kettle; let boil until tender. Then si rain the juice through double cheese cloth, without squeezing the cloth,, and to one cup of this strained juice add 1 cup of sugar, putting sugar anil juice into the preserving kettle to gether. Now boil this mixture un til a little of it, when dripped from a spoon held high in the air above the kettle, will make two drops on the spoon at once instead of one; this is tho jelly stage, and the mixture should be taken from the stove rt once and poured into hot jelly glasses which have been boiled. Let the filled glasses stand until they have become solid and aro cold, then melt paraffins and pour this ovr the top of each glass to the depth of 1-4 inch. Let the paraffine harden, then label and store in a dry place. To Crystallize any kind of Peel Orange, lemon or grapefruit: Cut the peel in strips and cover with weak brine. Let stand over night. I TIPTON TIPS Chicago youth says a policeman started him on his downward career and our feuess is thut the cell was in tho basement. A new kind of machine kneads dough with metal arms. And it is along about Christmas timo that we begin to think of tho fellows that need dough without any arms. . 4 Pessimists are daily expecting a ban on joy because some people become intoxicated with" it.

Tho New Mexico sheepmen seem dotermined that no ono shall pull the wool over their eyes. The difference in posing as an officer In reel and real life just about amounts to that be tween best cell and best seller, - Drain off brino and boll peel for three hours, changing water every hour. For each quart of peel make a sirup of 4 cups of sugar and 1 1-4 cups of water, putting the peel in this sirup. Let boil until sirup is nearly cooked , away and thick. Then drain the peel in a colander and roll in 'granulated sugar while still warm. To "Candy" Citron (any kind of vegetable or fruit may be done in this way): Cut the citron in small sections or' in narrow strips not more than two inches long. Drop those pieces in a sirup made by combining 1 cup of sugar with 1-2 cup of water and letting this boil until It "spins" a thread when a little is dripped back into the pan from a spoon held high in the air. Do not drop the pieces in before the sirup has reached this "spin ning" stage. If it is desired to have a ginger sirup, simply add a few roots of ginger to this same sirup. Cook until the fruit or veg etable Is transparent, then drain in a colander, dry in a slow oven, and, roll in granulated sugar. (Fruits need not necessarily be rolled In the sugar.) This method is espec ially delicious when used for candied peaches, apples, pears and carrots. The woman who is fond of en tertaining and yet has no money to spare, for little "side dishes" of after-dinner mints, bonbons, salted nuts and such other dainties usually seen on tho table of a "company" meal, will do well to learn to candy fruits and veg etables and crystalize fruit peel ings; for these simple sweetmeats are just as delicious as the bonbons and mints add are inexpensive as well. nlia.ll find a feather somewhere in the woods!" So he hopped on through the forest, looking here and there for feathers, but as there had been a high wind in the night, any feathers that might have been dropped from the winter birds had been blown away. "Dear me!" said Uncle Wiggily to himself, as he skipped along, poking the leaves over with his red, white and blue striped rheu matism crutch. "Baby Bunty will be so disappointed if I don't find a feather for her! I simply must get one!" But, though he looked every where, not a feather could he pick up, and, sad and sorrowful, he turned back toward his hollow stump bungalow. He was wondorlng what he could Bay to Baby Bunting, when, all of a sudden, Uncle Wiggily heard Nurse Jane crying: "Go on now, if you please! Ply away and do yuor screeching somewhere else! You make my ears ache! Flutter along!" Uncle Wiggily saw his muskrat lady housekeeper waving her broom, and then he heard a harsh voice crying: "Hay! Hay! Hay!" "Dear me!" thought the bunny uncle, as he hopped along faster. "Some one is making troublo for Nurse Jane!" Uncle Wiggily caught Bight of a bluebird, flushing in the sunlight as it darted away through the trees, and he heard Nurse Jane calling: "Shoo Shoo! Shoo!" "Who are you shooing, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy?" asked the bunny gentleman. "Oh, one of those loud-voiced bluejay birds," answered Nurse Jane. "They are nice to look at, and they do some good in the world, but they are bo noisy I'm afraid they'll wake up Baby Bun ty, who has gone asleep. Go on away, Mr. Blue Jay!" she cried, waving her broom again as the blue bird darted back. r , IS .ll V-x "Any loose feathers today, ' Mrs. Chick?"askj2d the bunny. ..liii . in "Smearsky is a great striver for versatility art."

THE LEGION WINS ANOTHER ROUND. .With the decree handed down Monday by Judgo Reed Holloman, at Santa Fe, making permanent the injunction ugainst tho release" of the sixteei Villistas now in the state penitentiary In connec tion with the Columbus raid, the American Legion of the state has won another round in its effort to keep the men in prison. The case seems to have been fully and ably argued by the attorneys on both sides, and well considered by the presiding judge. Until the state supreme court passes on the matter, however, the Mexicans still have a chance to be free. It Is deplorable that such a case should have to be presented before the courts.

"What I want, Uncle Wiggily, Is a feather for my new hat. Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy bought me the hat. but they had no feathers in the soven-and-eight-cent store. I wish you would bring me one!" "I will!" promised Uncle Wig gily. "I am not very good at shopping for hats, bonnets, dress goods or things like that," he said, "but I think I can manage to bring you back a feather, Baby Bunty.

In provisions the outcome varied from 40c decline to 12c ad vance. Refusal ot exporters to follow the recent upturn fn wheat prices gave a decided advantage to bears throughout the day. Selling was active from the start and wan said to come in a considerable degree from foreign Interests. Part of the selling was ascribed to the uncon firmed gossip that officials of the Canadian government had com pleted arrangements with Minne apolis mills to devote 3.000 cars to the hauling of wheat from Cana dian terminals to Minneapolis dur ing the winter. On the other hand knowledge of additional bank fail ures in North Dakota, Including one federal reserve Institution, was positive and did a good deal I to deprive the market of support except from shorts who were in a position to collect profits.
