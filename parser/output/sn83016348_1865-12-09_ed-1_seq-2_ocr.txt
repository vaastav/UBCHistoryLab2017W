The “ €-li|iie/ 9 The Jlemocral, in its hallucination' of ! mind, devotes another MiaVL-r to •** (’liijne, *' in its last week’s i'ssiic. The ! *• Clique *’ grows more uiisiilA ; fantial and I mythical the more it is discussed by that or ’ gun. I hat “ Fliijii ” r j’p'iiars even less un : substantial than lie Ghost in Hamlet, for j after repeatca trials The Ik/iiucrnf has tailed I to make the injured public see it.’’ i We had one important fact brought to our j knowledge last week in connection with the I history of the “ Clique.'*’ It appears by that -beet —and The Democrat won't lie —that the *• Clique has been holding high revel in The Whig office —in fact, managing every thing there with romantic impunity. This announcement quite alarmed us, coming, as it did, so unexpectedly upon us, and from so infallible a source —for nil know, by this time, that The Democrat won't lie. We made strict inquiry of the printers whether they bad discovered anything unusual about the office, and instituted n search, but no I races were found of the animal; the furni ture and fixtures of the ollicc were all found in their places, and every tiling in the same order it was placed by the workmen. We have had a watch kept up in the office since this startling fact has been announced, but nothing unusual has, as yet, been discovered. The creature irfust cither be very diminutive, or unsubstantial; like the “ baseless fabric of a dream," for instance. Wo are determined, however, to make further efforts to detect or capture this “ What Is It? —and have ordered a number of mousetraps to be kept set about the prem ises. If we are successful in capturing the •‘varment," we propose to place it on exhi bition with that other mysterious animal whose tracks have appeared in The Democrat on several occasions recently. This latter animal is not so great a natural curiosity as the one (according to The Demo crat) that haunts The Whig office, and is domiciled—when at home —in the subter ranean caverns under the Court House. — The foot-prints which have appeared in The Democrat every Saturday morning, for sev •nil weeks past, have been inspected by naturalist, who pronounces them to be made by an ass. This discovery may be a clue to the “ Clique " mystery if we adopt the theory that some hold in regard to the matter, which is that the “ tfiiqiic " is all’gas. Now, gas being an invisible and exceed ingly volatile substance, escapes the eye and is distinguished rirost readily by the olfac tory organs—for some such substance, es sence or spirit known as the 11 Clique musl '•xist, as The Democrat avows it, and that organ won t he, as The If hig has often proved. But to pursue the gas theory. We read in Job that the asses snuffed up the East wind. Now it is within the bounds of probability that this animal, whose trucks have been discovered in The Democrat , being of tin same species of the cattle of Uz—and that class is noted for 'ts inviolability to change — may have been exorcising his lungs in the same kind of pastime, that is “ snuffing up the East, wind,” and as the gas-house is in an easterly direction from The Democrat ollicc, this animal, which has been taking such liberties with the columns of that paper recently, may have snuffed the tainted air. and straightway enchanted the proprietors of The Democrat with this gassy creation of the u Clique,” I his is decidedly the most probable theory (or the “ Clique ” that we have met with, and in lieu of the mousetraps failing to catch ” the *• varment ” that is reported to -infest ihe Whig office, we will adopt this theory as the only solution of the ‘ * Clique” mystery, and endeavor to protect our prem ises against intrusions from this ghostly vis ’ itor, the “ Clique,” by nailing a horseslfoc over The Whig office door. This charm has never been known to fail against witchcraft and all such machinations of the Evil One. But wc still have faith in the mousetraps, for our bumps of the marvelous are not very largely developed, a belief in the superna tural not exerting a very strong influence over us, and if wc arc so successful as to secure this rara aris , we propose to have it caged along with that other ill-favored spe cimen of the animal kingdom, whose foot prints have been discovered in The Demo crat, and placed on exhibition, as a kind of offset to Bamum’s wonderful Happy Family, described in the lust issue of The Democrat. One of the editors of that organ can travel with this rare show, while the other stays at home to fire up the machine and keep it in operation, grinding food for the Copper heads of Cecil. This would be a rare spec ulation for the enterprising managers of The Democrat. With one editor to puff the show through The Democrat, and the other to exhibit the “ hattlinals,” they might soon rival Artemns Ward. If our mousetraps catch this “ Clique,” tire show speculation will be better than* an oil well to The Demo crat, which will be unusually refreshing after the shocking run of bad luck it has hud iu politics. fir Tr<ml>les In The Cecil Democrat of last week is an article complaining that the world, the flesh and the devil are contending against the de mocracy. If by the world it means the people, or that portion of the voting class, which re sides in the United States, it docs seem that they are rather against the democracy. But how is it that the flesh is crying out against It? Perhaps from the high price of whiskey it is not sufficiently saturated to soar aloft in st*s proper element, and reach the high destiny to which it aspires ; and the evil ge nius of the Legislature has given it another blow iu the same direction, by prohibiting its use o*i election days, so that freemen have not a chance to show their ardent zeal for the republic, and their ability ibr self-govern ment by getting drunk. But that the old Rebel, his Satanic Majesty, should turn against his loyal followers, after being the only potentate to acknowledge the Confed eracy, is the unkindcst cut of all. A- house divided against itself cometh to nought. - Mk Craswell has boon placed en the following standing Committees of the Sen ate, Agriculture, I’uhlie Lunds, Mines and Mining. standing Committees of the House will not hr announced before Monday. • Voters Instead hf Population ttie llusis of Representation iu Congress. Mr. Sumner, of the Senate, has intro duced a joint resolution proposing to amend i the Constitution, so as to make voters, in stead of population, the basis of represen | inli-e in Ortli, of Indiana. notice of a bill tii amend the Constitution, so as to appor tion representation in Congress according to i the number of legal voters in eneli district. [ Thus we find on the first day of the session the majority moving in the right direction to ; solve this problem of representation in Con- i gross, which, as it now stands in the Consti tution, is an outrage to common sense. The luleniul Iteratin' tlecord keeps the i following at the head of its columns, us its \ political motto: “The tax payers nf the Union-North and South, East and West—demand, in the name of eternal justice, that there shall be no taxation without eipml representation! They demand that Article 1.. Section 11.. of the Constitution of the United States, shall be anietiiltMl, so as to .secure the free opera- i lion of this sacred principle, which is en dungercMl hy the altered condition of our lational affairs. They demand that Repre sentatives in Congress shall be apportioned among the several Stales, no longer upon the existing false basis, mitt accohdino to THE NT.MIiEU OF ELECTORS IN EACH STATE.” This s evidently the true principle on which to establish republican government.— Any other tends to aristocracy. No citizen can be truly represented in the legislative halls of a Slate or ((alien who is denied the privilege of assisting by his vote to choose the member who is to represent him. What an absurdity it was for the three-fifths of the slaves in the Southern Slates to be repre sented by members in Congress, when those slaves had neither property or acknowledged political rights to represent. Those super fluous members were (here solely for the purpose of giving power to the aristocratic element that held sway in the South. The Democrat, driven into a corner. ind its rascality exposed hy The Whig, con iines itself, entirely, in its last issue, to fish market defense. We advise it to stick to that system of tactics j to ho sure they are very dirty but altogether safe. It resembles those rogues who wallow in the gutter to prevent decency from laying hands upon them. How it will stamp and pull its hair, and, perhaps, even swear in its rage, when it finds that Mr. McPherson excluded the lames of Its rebel friends from the roll of members of the House, and the representa tives from tin; loyal Stales served them like poor Tray, chopped their tails off close be hind their cars: r.'nd this, too, in the very face o/ The Democrat's mandat, py argument for the enlightenment of the Clerk of the Mouse, for which it was reported it had re ceived an autograph letter of thanks from that officer. A Sew Feature. Onr neighbor, The Democrat, in sfatingits ■ many virtues and claims to public patronage, names among them a “ new feature " lately introduced—“a news column" —and pro nounces it an entire success. M ell, news in a newspaper—we believe that is what The Democrat lias always claim ed to be —is something novel. We have no doubt of its great success. The enterprising proprietors should lose no time in seeming a patent right for that discovery. Thev might manage to sell a larger number of rights in connection with that little itinerant show business, which .we propose to them.

The Message; L liable from* the want of space to give the , Message of President Johnson, delivered to Congress on Tuesday, in full, we print the following synopsis, whK'ii will give those of i our readers wlfb do not care to peruse so long a document an idea of tins contents of that important state paper. The Message and Reports of the Secretaries are printed in | the Press, tilling seventy-two columns of small type. The President opens his Message with an expression ol gratitude to Cod tor the pre servation of the Cnited States. He then raters to the griel of the nation at the dtath |of his predecessor by the hand ol an as-ms ■ sin, atlcr he had lived to enjoy iTle highest ! proot ot the nation’s conlidenee by* an elec ; I,on to a renewed term of ollice, and after j he hud brought the war substantially to a ; close. j Alter the closing of hostilities, the first I quest ion that presented itself for his decision I was, whether the territory within the limits of the recovered States should beheld as conquered territory, under military authority emanating from the President as the head (*! Pe finny. He opposed the policy of mili tary rule, for various reasons. The true theory is, that till pretended acts of seces sion were from the beginning, nail and void. If any State neglects or refuses to perform its offices, there is I lie more need that the general government should maintain ail it* authority, and ns soon as practicable, resume the exercise ol all its functions, which, hap pily for as nil, brings with it a blessing to the States over which they are extended.— ' He has fc’tt ?? tfCCCTsary to assert one other power of the general government, the power of pardon, connected with the clearest re cognition of the binding force of the law of the Tinted States, and tin acknowledgment of the change in regard to slavery. The next step, which the President says he has taken to restore the constitutional relations of the Slates has been an invitati n to them to participate in the high ollice of amending the Constitution. The adoption of the pro posed amendment reunites ns beyond all power of disruption. It will elface the sad memory of the past, and bind ns more than ever to mutual affection and support Kv?ry patriot must wish fora general amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with tlie public good. . For this great end there is need of a concurrence of all opinions, and spirit of . mutual conciliation. The amendment to the constitution being adopted, it would remain for the States whose powers have been so long in abeyance to resume their places in the two branches of the national legislature, and thereby complete the work of restora tion. “ Here,” says the President, “it is for you. fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives, to judge each for yourselves, of the election returns and the qualifications of your own members.” He hopes that Congress may make an early provision lor the resumption of allots judicial functions. Persons charged with treason should have fair and impartial trials in the highest civil tribunals of the country. The truth should he ailirmed that treason is a crime, and traitors should be punished, and the offense made infamous, and that the question should be judicially sett Iml, that no ; State has the right of its own will to renounce its place in the L nion. In relation to the question of extending the right of suffrage to the freedmen eman cipated by the war, and of necessity to the free colored men in all the Stales of the Union, the President gives emphatic utter ance in accordance with his previous well known views and policy of referring it to the several States. He says it, may prove that colored men will receive the kindliest usage from some of those on whom they have here tofore most closely depended. Hut while he has no doubt that now. after the close of the war, it is not competent for tin* general gov ernment to extend the elective franchise in the several States, it is equally clear tiiat ■ good faith requires the security of the freed- . men m Bifir liberty and their properly, their i right to labor red* 16 claim the just return ol j lb*ir labor. Now that the monopoly of slave j labor bus been removed from the States ! nearest the Hull’ of Mexico, the influx of I free labor will people those regions with a ! numerous and an enterprising population : which will vie with any in the Union, in j compactness, inventive genius, wealth and ( ; industry. The constitutional freedom of* commerce between the States •** referred to. - • and the right of any State to tax the transit 1 between S ales denied, ft constitutes one l | of the worst forms of monopoly, and t lie : 1 evil is increased il coupled with a denial of | the choice of route, livery such obstacle 1 ought to he sternly guarded against by ap ! propriate legislation within the limits of the i constitution. These remarks, it will he sap- 1 posed, have a bearing on such railroads as : are burdened with a consolidation lax, pass ing from one Slate to another. The President refets to the reports of the different secretaries. That of the* Secretary of the Interior presents evidence of the suc cessful operation of the homestead act, over one million and ahalf of acres having been entered the past fiscal year and occupied by industrious settlers. The business of the Pension Bureau has largely increased, the number of pensioners being now Ho,bßbj re quiring for their annual pay over 5H,000,000. The President says that a grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures for the rebel of soldiers (or their wives) who have asauied to preserve our national exist "ence. The President refers to the report of the Secretary of War, which stales that the volunteer force has already been reduced by the discharge of ewer 800,000 troops. It is proposed t’o reduce the regular army to 50,000 men, so organised that the ranks may he tilled up to 82,000 men whenever re quired. The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury is commended, airrV it i.-* urged that “it is our first duty to prepare in earnest for the over increasing evils of an irredeemable cur rency,” ami by conducting business as nearly as possible on a system of cash pay ments or short credits, the people will be prepared to return to the standard of gold and silver. The duty is heartily recognized of diminishing the amount of paper money now in circulation. The department of agriculture, says the President, is accom plishing much. The President next turns to the foreign relations of the country, which are treated delicately and succinctly. He refers to the ♦qMions with which we are in friendly al liance, and then reviews the conduct of Great Britain, and the attempt of the Brit ish minister to justify the action of his gov ernment towards this country. While ho feels b^untJfodeclare hisopinion before Congress and the world, that that justification cannot be sustained by the tri bunal of nations, at the same time, he does not advise to any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation. In relation to the invasion of some parts of America in the interests of monarchy, the President says “he relies upon the wisdom and justice of tfhe European powers to respect the system of non interference, which has so long been sanctioned by time, and which by its good results has approved itself to both conti nents.” “We should regard it a great calamity should any European power chal lenge the American people to the defense of Republicanism against foreign interference.’ The correspondence* between France and England will, at a proper time, be laid before Congress. The message closes with a forcible eulogy upon the greatness of our country and upon the republican model of government, as ex hibited in our institutions, and solemnly invokes every citizen of onr favored land to aid in perpetuating our own free constitu tion. J fciT' We print a communication fVom Mr. Crawford to the The Democrat, which was refused by that very honorable paper. The article is received at so late an hour that we have not room for any comment. x V*r The Cecil Whig. Sorghum Growers' and Manu fiiclsuers’ Convention. Pursuant to public notice, a meeting of ‘j sorghum growers and manufacturers wufl held at Newark, Del., on the 2d in.*t. It was or ganized by the appointment of Milton Con 'l nrd.
