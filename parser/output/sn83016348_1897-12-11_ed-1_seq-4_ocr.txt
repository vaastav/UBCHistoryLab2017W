ELKTON, MARYLAND, DECEMBER 11, 189?. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. PRESIDENT McKINLEY’S first annual message was sent to Congress on Monday, unusual attention having been given it by both branches of that body. It is hut passing an impartial judgment upon it to say, that it is a frank, manly and exhaustive state piper, which amply reflects the intellectual and moral qualities of its author, and which will excite fresh confidence in his prudence, wisdom and sagacity as a statesman. It is not our purpose to present a long and tedious analysis of the President's message, but simply to note its salient features, particularly his views and recommendations on those two subjects of popular interest, currency reform, and the Cuban question, which iu a measure had been anticipated. Appreciating the absolute importance of protecting the Gov ernment against the necessity of further issues of bonds to main tain our National currency at a par with gold, the President recommends, that when United States notes are redeemed in gold they shall not he paid out again except in exchange for gold; or quoting his own language he recommends, “that as soon as the receipts of the Government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government, when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold, and are redeemed in gold, snob notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange [nr gold.” The plan is a simple one but no less effective, appealing at once to popular intelligence and common sense, or as a contem teuiporary puts it, if the greenback is good enough to draw gold when it is paid in why should it not be good enough to draw gold when it is paid out? If the holder uses it to get gold why should he recover it without returning the gold? If the green back is to he exchangeable for gold why shouldn't the rule operate lor the Government as well as for the individual? The result would he that, after the notes were once redeemed, for evety dollar of paper that went forth a gold dollar would stand in its place. That would break “the endless chain;” it would give absolute security; it would keep assured parity. It removes the danger of the greenbacks without contracting the currency. It provides for taking them up without issuing any interest bearing bonds. A vital part of the plan is a revenue equal to expendi ture. Without that it would be just as necessary to borrow as it was under the Cleveland Administration. But the reoouise would at least have the merit of distinctly and avowedly borrow ing to meet deficit instead of borrowing under the false pretence of maintaining the gold reserve. The President recommends to the earnest consideration of Congress the currency plan of Secretary Gage, concurring in the establishment of hanks with $35,000 capital, and in allowing hanks to issue notes, the denomination of which shall not he under $lO, up to the face value of their bonds. A careful review aud conservative consideration of all the conditions involved in the Cuban question, leads the President to the conclusion, that any action by the United States, even a recognition of belligerency should he delayed until the evident intention of the Sagasta Cabinet to reasonably pacify the Cubans and establish promised reforms shall have had full time aud opportunity to show its sincerity and value. In other words the President asks Congress and the country to wait on events as they unfold, neither anticipating their occur rence, nor when they arise avoiding their responsibility, by either trespassing on the rights of Spain, or disregarding the wrongs of Cuba We believe the business aud conservative sentiment of the country will sustain the attitude taken by the President. Following an extended discussion of the Cuban question the message deals distinctly and succinctly with a variety of subjects of wide importance. The treaty for the annexation of Hawaii is briefly averted to and urged. The Nicaragua canal should receive attention. The The International Bimetallic Commission has not been successful, though it may still make some not hopeful effort. International arbitration is favored. Measures tor Alaska and for the Indian Territory are suggested. Equipment and facilities are more needed tor the navy just now than new ships Civil Service Reform will he upheld. These are the minor topics of a message which exemplifies in every part the careful and judicious leader ship of a prudent and sagacious President and which will be received with cordial approval by the country. At the recent meeting of the State Association of School Commissioners aud Examineis, Governor Lowudes, Rev. J. E Nicholson and Prof. E. B. Prettyman were designated a com mittee to prepare a memorial to be presented to Congress asking that the State of Maryland lie given a share in the distribution of the monies derived from the sale of public lands. Such monies are, by the laws of other States, used for school purposes. Should the claim be graited by Congress a large amount would he realized by the State. An exchange quotes Prof. Prettyman as saying: “I have been interested in this important question for some time, and after a long anil careful search I can see no plausible reason why we Marylanders should not share in the distribution of public lauds. During several trips through Western States I noticed that all had magnificent public school buildings, aud the greater part of the money (or the purpose was received from the sale of public lands. I believe that the public lauds of the United States should be sacredly devoted to the advancement of public education. “For a long time the Maryland Statesmen iu tho Continental Congress were the only representatives to advocate national jur isdiction over tlie Western lands. Their efforts were finally suc cessful, and the national government was placed in control of the public lands. 1 ‘This is a good reason why Maryland should he granted a •hare ol the large areas of lands in the West. Only one vigorous attempt has been made until recently, so far as I can ascertain, to change the national policy in connection with the public lands, in IH2I the General Assembly of Maryland adopted an elaborate report to the effect that each of tlie United .States had an equal right to pm tie pate iu the benefit of the public lands. The t.egis latui es of se .ei .il States endorsed this report, hut this appears to have been the etui of the matter.” Frof. Prettyman said that the public lands in the United States ' i igiualty amounted to l,s 10,000,000 acres, hut only about 000,0 .o,ouo acieo still leniaiu in government control, exclusive of Alaska. 

CECIL WHIG, ELKTON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1897. AM) now oonu► the spcoii.l step, in the effect of the new tiiiiH'. the improvement in waKPH. The first improvement under a protective tariff of course would be that relating to the number of pmple employed as soon as the new law was assured. This was felt, for it will be remembered that there was a marked increase in the number of people employed, e.en before the Dingley bill went upon the statute books The second step in the result of the measure is increased wages and that is uow beginning to make itself apparent. Notices have been pasted in the Mahoning Valley, in Ohio, announcing an increase of twenty per cent, in wag>s among the limestone operatives of that section, reports come from the iron mines of Michigan and Pennsylvania that wages are to he increased ten per cent, on January first, while large numbers of manufacturing establishments in various parts of the country have already announced an increase in wages. It will be a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to millions in the United States to whom the holiday season brought little of brightness in former years. Tim administration has managed its work so admirably an to give the enemy no points of vantage, while the tariff legislation of the special session of Congress is so satisfactory to the public that it oinnot he successfully attacked. Democratic attacks about the Cuban policy, the Hawaiian policy, and the Pacific Railroad sale have one by one failed, while the general prosperity which has followed Republican control makes the demand for Democratic campaign ammunition very great. As a result the Democrats are anxiously waiting for the developments of the next few months, though they are likely to be as much disappointed in them as they have been in their failure to find vulnerable points in the woik of Congress and the administration thus far. That mnoli-talked-of visit of Mr. Bryan to Mexico is now to begin. The Mexicans are to be told, presumably in their native tongue, how much better off they are with a tree-coinage system, in which it takes two and a-half silver dollars to buy an article whiuh one silver dollar under the limited-coinage system of the United States will buy, and on his return Mr. Bryan is to explain to the people of this country the advantage which would come to them by exchanging our currency system with its l;i one hundied-oent dollars per cipita for the Mexican system of 5 forty ceut dollars per capita. The public will anxiously await this somewhat remarkable undertaking of this somewhat remarkable financier. The United States as a whole is following the example which the farmers of the country set in utilizing their first earn ings for a reduction of their mortgage indebtedness. Less of American securities are now being held abroad than at any time in the past quarter of a century, thus showing that the country, like the citizens, is reducing as rapidly as possible the amount which it must pay to others for interest on indebtedness. WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, December loth, HOT. Regular Correspondence Cecil Whig. The great sympathy felt for the bereavement of President McKinley tinged the assembling of Congress with unusual sadness which not even the great interest felt in the strong message of the President could dissipate. There were the usual crowds in the galleries of both House and Senate, but the sorrow expressed iu the faces of ,Senators and Representatives was reflected in the faces of the visitors above them There is something in the death of one’s mother that appeals to the sympathies of others as does the death of no other relative. * * * Had President McKinley followed the examhle of his imme diate predecessor, who rarely finished one of his messages to Con gress until tlie day before Congress met, his message would not have been ready, but be completed the message a week ago, and did not have that on Ida mind while traveling to the bedside of his stricken mother, from which he returned to Washington to perform the duties incumbent upon him at the opening of the session of Congress. As soon us those duties were performed lie started for Canton again, to perform a more painful duty, carrying witli him the sorrowful sympathies of the whole country. * * * Three P’s, patriotism, peace, and prosperity form the keynote of President McKinley’s annual message to Congress. His treat ment of the Annexation of Hawaii, the Cuban and other foreign questions, including that of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic to the core, without the slightest trace of jingoism, and Ids treat ment of the financial and other domestic questions is that of a mau who only desires that which will continue and increase the prosperity the country is now beginning to enjoy. * * * In addition to getting a first-class man to fill the important position of Attorney General, President McKinley’s choice of Ciov. John W Griggs, of New Jersey, to fill the vacancy in the Cabinet that will he made by the nomination of Attorney General McKenna to succeed Justice Field, who retired from the U. S. Supreme Court last week, after having served there longer than any of his predecessors, is considered to he a good political move— one that will aid materially in keeping New Jersey in the Repub lican column, and the wish is general that Governor Griggs will accept the tendered portfolio. # * The activity iu certain quarters in efforts to make tire public believe that there is some doubt about the auuexation of Hawaii, iudicates that some money is being spent for the purpose of creat ing auti-aunexatiou sentiment. If so, it is being thrown away, ns annexation is absolutely sure to come before the close of this session of Congress. Two-thirds of the Senate are ready at any time to vote for the ratification of the annexation treaty, hut the rules of the Senate put it in the power of the opponents—not more than twenty at the outside—to delay the vote. Should it become apparent that this power is being used fur filibustering purposes, annexation will be secured by legislation, which will only need a majority vote. * * The more conservative element iu Cougrsss is strongly in favor of making this session as short as possible. This sentiment was voiced by Representative Heatwole, of Minnesota, when lie said; “In my opinion, tide Congress should get through its rou tine work by May 1 and adjourn. The smallest amount of legis lation will be of the greatest benefit to the country, and if we can finish and go home by that date a good many millions of our countrymen will rise up and call us blessed.” Speaker Reed says he sees no excuse at present for making the session a very long one.” * * Nothing of more general benefit to the morals of the country has been done lately than the ollioial announcement of the I’ost Office Department that the mails would hereafter he closed to newspapers that print missing-letter word contests, or any other kind of advertising matter containing chance or lottery schemes. Some of the most daring swindling of the age lias been conducted by this class of advertisers, all of which violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the anti-lottery law. Inasmuch as about $110,000,000 will he expended upon River and Harbor improvements, under contracts previously made, dur the next fiscal year there is quite a strong feeling iu Congress iu favor of omitting the usual River and harbor appropriation bill at this session. No agreement to that effect has actually been made, but it will not be surprising should that be the result of the ex changes of opinion on the subject uow going on.
