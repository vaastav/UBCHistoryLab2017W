The Messenger Is mailing statement of subscriptions, in sealed envelopes, to all delinquent subscribers. This was done to let every one know how hs stood and n give every one an oppor tunity to remit amonrit in settlement f the same. Many will respond promptly, we have no doubt, buit some will mt, we fear. We desire to say that the Semi Weekly Messenger (two papers, 8 pages each per week) is well worth -the price we charge, $1.00 per year, and to send it year after year wilthout receiving -anything for it, is more than we can afford, or will do. It is tto be hoped hat those who receive statement will promptly remilt, as the money is need- It has been the habit of some in the past to entirely ignore statement -of their subscription account, and we earnestly ask those to remit. "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Th very long and well written mes " sage of President McKinley will be read generally with unusual interest. Ow ing to the very radical and new depar ture made by his administration in the grave matter of foreign conquests, a large space is demanded for the con sideration of the wars waged and the serious results following. The mes sage presents in good style the cause of the administration, and with no lit tle of plausibility, self gratulation and earnest persuasion. If the president is really sincere in all he says, he believes that to turn back on the policy and tra ditions of our republic, to ignore the 'Constitution and the declaration of in dependence, to set aside as effete and annnro nnno f rl oil fha toapVi .n era nf t ri o greatest men this country has produc ed, to repudiate all the safe guards and muniments as well as- faiths of the people Is wise, just, progressive, noble, merciful, great. Such is the real mean ing of his studied, labored, deliberate plea for his conduct as presented in his insinuating, astute and something ' ingenious message to the congress. Let the people study it carefully and then let them read the elaborate arguments already presented in the magazines and great newspapers, and to be pre sented in both houses of the new con gress, before coming to any conclusion. . Hear both sides is a sound maxim, '-ancient, and yet modern by necessity. We make this statement because the body of the message is devoted to strictly foreign affairs, and the sub jects connected therewith are multi tudinous owing to the rapid "expan siveness" and warlike policy of the ad ministration. Empire means numerous foreign possessions and complications and urgent responsibilities. For the current year the "expansion" "was immense in agricultural exports they amounting to $784,776,142, greater by far than ever before. Do not make a mistake here, and think that the Mc Kinley war in the Philippines and cer tain "expansion" in Hawaii and else where have one thing to do with it. The receipts for the fiscal year ending '30th June last, were $610,982,004.35 greater by far than ever before. Here is "expansion" with a vengeance high taxes. Expenditures $700,093,564.02 showing a clear dificit of over $89,000, tWO, a sum larger than President Buch- anan required to carry on all the oper ations of the government for an entire year say in 1860. In other words the expenditures were as much in one year under McKinley as they would have been in eight years under the demo cratic president, Buchanan. .The secretary of the treasury guesses that for the next year ending 30th June 1900, there will be but $640,958,112, re ceipts and only $600,985,112 expenditures vwith $40,000,000 surplus. Remember and -see how well he guesses. If the admin istration thinks that way why not cut -down the item of revenue? Why raise a needless revenue. If the foreign wars f continue and the 100,000 stand'ng army "Is raised, and the dozen new war ves ? aels shall be built, as is the taifc among republicans, then we would sooner ex- - pect an expenditure of $800000.000 and - sv corresponding deficit than the pro- posed reduction. There is an available cash balance of $278,004,837.72, of which $239,741503.26 is r in gold. Think of annual expenditures of over $700,000,000, and but 2278.000.000 of available cash. Is that healthy bus iness? It would not be in private bus iness actions. The president refers to the purchase f bonds to which the Messenger called .-attention with comments recently, reports the sale satisfactory. He re fers with high satisfaction to the pres ent era of prosperity, but thinks mere money supply Is needed to move crops, etc. He favors organizing national banks with $25,000 capital. He is ... . 11.. IT. ' stauncniy ior me biij&ic a He has turned a summersault upon the last repuDiican pianorm. uc iu....w something about the parity of gold and silver, which is in his mouth unmlti- - gated bosh. With him 50 cents silver amounts to preserving and "maintain ing the party." To quote him. He wants congress to give the secretary of the treasury, the power to sell bonds. "What! He also wishes the greenbacks to be redeemed and kept out of circula tion practically, if not paid in gold. It is noticable that the president does not favor subsidies for merchant ma rine by name, but he is in favor of it all the same, and thinks the American people are. Not the tax-payers surely. He has much to say against trusts. .We can only hope he is honest and sin cere. Let the congress take steps to put bits and brakes upon the monsters of Iniquity. The president thinks there must be a remedy for such curses. Let it be found by the congress. Some thing is wrong in our laws and courts or the laws now existing against trusts would be vigorously and wisely enforc ed. We have but little faith In repub licans when they come to consider trusts. Their high robber tariff has created and fostered the monsters of Iniquity, and they may be suspected when they express antagonism to them. The law already created de clares that "trust or monopoly in re straint of interstate or international commerce" is unlawful and all Injured thereby can recover damages. Make the law more drastic, more sweeping so the rascals cannot find safe shelter from the popular storm or the demands of the law. The president brings in rapid review our relations with Chili, Argentine Re public, Brazil, Italy, etc. He favors the Isthmian Canal. He favors a commission to study the Chinese mar kets and enlarges upon the importance of the Paris exposition. The Alaskan boundary' 's referred to at length. It Is not yet settled. Also affairs with Italy are treated of, and both countries will agree to a naturalization conven tion. He wants a cable to be placed connecting with Manila. This country you see must have such connections with ail outlying conquests and "ex pansions." The treaty with Japan is considered and kind expressions for Mexico indulged. Samoa and its troubles with its "partition" between Germany and the United States, is mentioned. We read in history of the "partition of Poland," which has been damned by poets and historians as in famous in the extreme. Uncle Sam joins Germany in another "partition" that may be loaded with infamy and dynamite. The president treats of Cuba at much length. He sets forth what has been done in the way of government, in be half of law and justice and reforms. He says that "free Cuba must be a reality." Very well. Let the congress take the matter in hand and see that every thing heretofore promised to Cuba by the country shall be done in utmost good faith. There are now 45,966 soldiers in Ma nila, and soon the force will be 65,534. In Cuba and Porto Rico and Hawaii there are in officers and men 14,537. In the United States there are 910 of ficers and 17,317 men. So in all the army now is 98,296. The people are now bearing this huge burden. He re commends that the navy be still farth er enlarged. He treats at length his war in the Philippines. He says it must be ended, and thinks the end is not distant. Here him glibly writing, "the rebellion must be put down." How those Yanks can spit out "rebellion." And yet for op pression not comparable to those they have visited upon the Philippines they rushed into a seven years' war with Great Britain and showed them selves the worst of "rebels." Ameri can sovereignty must first be estab lished and then the congress must take in hand all that shall be done with the Philippines. We are glad that the congress and not McKinley is to deal with this question. He says the Major General commanding in Negros put into force a system .of govern ment. Of the Sulu islands and its Sul tan he has something to say. A treaty has been made with these people where polygamy is worse than it is in Utah and perhaps in Turkey, and slavery exists. He says that the United States have not given their consent to. the slavery feature, but we believe he is silent as to the polyga my. McKinley modestly declines to tell the congress what shall be the government for the Philippines. He should be thanked by a rising vote of both bodies for this wonderful for bearance. But space warns us to close this very rapid survey, omitting several parts the message contains, but not of great moment. He recommends a governor and other officers be appointed to gov ern Porto Rico, and talks of "local self-government being applied at once." It must be governed by Uncle Sam, and it is doubtful in that event how local self-government will fare. He is not careful of such matters as he should be when dealing with th south and the rights of sovereign states at home. McKinley tries to justi fy his strange acts in slaughtering civil service to a considerable extent after having been a pronounced advocate of it. But he often kicks over his own buckets. Points raised in the mes sage may require special examination from time to time; The president "talks prettily" and shows art and sa gacity in his efforts "to make the worse appear the better reason." He is no mean advocate, but then he has the great advantage of many helps and advisers. He is . either a very good and true man or a mouthing demagogue and a decided hypocrite. He writes at the end "Aiming only at the public rood, we can not err." Yet, the means may be wrong and insuffi cient. If politicians in places of pub lic trust and responsibility were in variably true and upright, and If they aimed as Wolsey counselled Thomas Cromwell to aim "Be iust and fear not: Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's. Thy God's and truth's." then indeed would righteousness and honesty and justice prevail, and our country would be at peace forever-more. 

CIIARGES AS TO FEDERAL COURTS The newspapers have had something to say about abuses and improper in fluences in the federal courts. The first charge appeared in the Greensboro Record and was not sustained.although said to be brought by a prominent re publican attorney. In the Winston Sentinel an article appears by a law yer whose name is accessible, and he goes far enough to say this: "Judge Ewart is not unduly influenc ed by Pritchard, yet every deputy col lector, 'form ten men, and some dep uty marshals, are telling the unfortun ate defendants, 'get Pritchard; he Is the man; he can do what he pleases with the judge and district attorney.' And thus both judge and district attor ney are being unjustly censured." The Tennessee republican lawyer is very active in attending federal courts, and the last writer says that the clients of other lawyers "have been taken from under their noses after fees had been actually paid, because their clients have been told that democrats had no influence with judge or district attor ney." If true it Is a great outrage and shame, indecent and vicious. But this is not all that the correspondent of the Sentinel (signed "On-Looker") says. He make3 a statement so plainly true and easy of proof that it will not sur prise others who have attended the courts. It Is this: "Again there is another thing that is bringing the court into contempt. Attend it and you will think you are attending a big republican convention, for the 'big men of the party are all there. The term of the court is select ed as the time and place for calling to gether the state executive committee to Issue an address denouncing the constitutional amendment, and though at a time of year when no campaign is in progress, the term of Statesville court is chosen for Senator Pritchard to issue hi3 prepared manifesto In aid of republicanism, and Mr. LInney al lowed to Inflame the minds of jurors by his 'low flung wit and violent abuse of democrats." Now is not that a fine condition of things? The courts are turned into oc casions of misleading clients and of holding republican political pow-wows In which to concoct schemes and be fuddle the ignorant, confiding people. The pity of it all is that It is true, and being true it is a reflection upon not only those engaged in the demoralizing game, but it lowers the courts in the opinion of all good, decent people. The Charlotte Observer considering the charges brought, of the last one says this: "Everybody knows that this is true, and it is a public scandal. It is true that some of the sessions of the federal court in this district are very like republican conventions." Here is a matter that Mr. Linney might pierce with his stylus, and in suppressing such wrongs he would accomplish far more good than trying to reply to Mr. Thomas Settle. HOME FOLKS. Expenditures exceed income in the North Carolina state government by "perhaps $200,000." Mighty bad! An empty treasury and a cry for funds is heard in the land. The Raleigh Post copies the recent paragraph in the Messenger as to su periority in results in tobacco over wheat. It gives what Mr. Cy. Thomp son says of Onslow farming, that to bacco averages from 900 to 1200 pounus to the acre, and beats even cotton at seven cents a pound. We quote: "The average yield of cotton in this state is a half bale of 480 pounds to the acre. A bale of 500 pounds at 7J cents is worth $37.50. Add $5.00 for the value of the cotton seed, and this makes the bale an dits by-product worth $43.50. Two acres required to produce this leaves the return per acre $21.25. In the case of tobacco, if the yield per acre was just 400 pounds, at an aver age of 6 cents per pound, would pay better than cotton at 7J cents, and if the yield is anything like the 900 or 1,200 suggested by Secretary Thompson the advantage of the crop over cotton is manifest." We have seen the time when farmers received $100 for a bale, but even then tobacco in the fine counties was much more profitable for, as we know, there were many farmers who made clear from $300 to $600 to the acre on tobacco. We can name a dozen farmers who made that. BREVITIES. Talk of peace while perhaps a half dozen wars are raging. The Peace conference has done nothing to make even war humane and just. Both Great Britain and the United States figured conspicuously in the conference at the Hague. Talk is heard that McKinley will send troops to Kentucky to aid the governor, and not wait either for a re quest to do so. He is none too good for such work. Rev. Dr. De Costa who lately left the Episcopal church has gone to the Ro man Catholic church. "The fact that Dr. De Costa is married makes him ineligible for the priesthood, and he, therefore, has no ecclesiastical pros pects in the Catholic church. He has declared his intention of devoting himself to writing and lecturing." The cruel massacreing of Armenians continues in Asia at the bloody hands of the Kurds. Are they worse than great civilized nations? Up to now nearly 100,000 cotton' mill operatives have had wages increased by 10 per cent in Massachusetts cot ton mills. This is none to much, and not really enough considering the present surprising era of unrivalled progress. What are the southern mills doing In this direction? Will they fail to advance also wages? It is to be hoped not. There are 106 new members in the house. One trust has been knocked out in the United States supreme court. It was on 4th Inst. In the Addystone Pipe case. Why cannot all trusts be dealt with in the same way? They de serve it. Several able democratic senators dis appear from the rolls, among them Turple, Gorman, Gray ancWFaulkner. There Is a fierce newspaper war wag ing between Colonel Elam, of the Nor folk Virginian-Pilot and the editor of the Richmond News. Colonel Elam has fought two duels, but it is under stood he gave it up years ago and we have heard that he had Joined the Methodist church. Pyny-Pectorall A

It will be remembered that a year or so siice, the governor of New Hampshire, in a fast day proclama tion, gave a very distressing account of towns and villages in his state, that were destitute of all religious privi leges, churches being closed, and the church-gong bell being no longer heard even on the Lord's Day. This shock ed the state and sent a shiver over the back of the descendants of Ply mouth Rock- But It was true. .While there Is Christian activity, and even there Is Increase In numbers, the story as given by Governor Rollins is known to have been accurate. The Episcopalu bishop in that state refers to the gov ernor's statement and indorses it. This leads the Boston Advertiser to state t Vi o Via tvnv am ir ta WlCLfc ()U 1 v 1 ilUl OtlVl VilV j ' 1 r LTT x I j correct, although sundry clergymen j have denied it. We make an Instruc- ! tive extract from The Advertiser that ! makes plain the exact contention of the i governor. It says: j "What Governor Rollins said was, i for substance, that there is In the j small back country towns of New ; Hampshire, from which a large part I of the best blood and brains and busi ness have been drained into the valley towns and cities, an arpalling state of things. He said that in those back j towns thus depleted there has been a j relapse into something like heathen ism. He called attention to an alleged prevalence of immorality, ignorance and lrreligion. That was it, and that was all. He did not say that the back country towns of Massachusetts were not every bit as bad. His proclama tion was addressed to New Hampshire, not Massachusetts. "Bishop Niles says the governor was right. The bishop is in a position to know. He is not under any temptation to make things out any worse than they are. The temptation would be more likely to be the other way." M'CARTIIY OX THE WAR WITH THE liOERS. The distinguished historian and nov elist of England, Justin McCarthy, member of the British parliament, and lately leader of the Irish members, is in New York and has been interview ed by The Journal. His opinion of the war against 'the Boers is the opinion of enlightened men all over the British kingdom. Its unpopularity is steadily growing in the kingdom, and many British officers oppose it. Even men now at the front believe the war un necessary, wrong, unrighteous. The English public was taken unawares and many indorsed at first who are sick of hi now. But is the war upon the Boers who are fighting for life, liberty and independence any more un righteous and cruel than the war that this once great Republic is waging against a small army of Filipinos? Mr. McCarthy says Cecil Rhodes, a man of bad character, and Joseph Chamber lain, are responsible for the war in the Transvaal in Africa. Bill McKinley and his "wicked partners" are responsible for the needless, cruel war in the Phil ippines, that is so dear to General Jo. Wheeler's southern heart. Some men live too long for their fame and good name. We quote from Mr. McCarthy, a statesman of large experience and de cided ability. He says: "Of course, Englani can crush the Boers if she will, can exterminate them if she thinks it necessary. It is only a question of time and money and the lives of brave English officers and sol diers, who have to go to theiT death be cause Mr. Chamberlain thinks we ought to have a war and Mr. Cecil Rhodes finds the Transvaal republic in his way. "There can be no possible question as to the result; we have only to kill so many of the Boers and of the Or ange Free State allies and the thing is done. The whole fighting population of both states could not, on an open battle ground, occupy a British army for very long. Therefore our war poli ticians may feel well assured that they will have their way in the end, always provided that no inconvenient compli cations with any other European state should arise in the meantime." No one believes that England would have jumped on Russia or Germany for a like cause. And no man of sense believes that McKinley and gang would have begun war with Great Bri tain under the present circumstances that belong to the Philippines. Both nations now are acting the pant of the Big Bully. If there was ever a minister of the Gospel who deserved to be tried by his church for extreme heretical vlewrs published to the country it is Professor McGiffert, of the Northern Presbyteri an church. He is heretical from top to foundation. A man with such views as he proclaims to refuse to resign and to hold on to a ministry he dis graces deserves no sympathy or jus tification at the hands of an enlighten ed press. A man of sensitive honor, of noble manhood, of pure Intention would as soon rob a grave as to enter tain his opinions and still dare to draw pay and to minister in the church whose theology he sacredly professed to believe in. He rejects the doctrine of the inspiration and inerrancy of the Holy Bible, the doctrine of the Divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ as perfect man, perfect God, and the institution of the Lord's Supper. He should be driven out of the Presbyterian Church that is indeed a most staunch, unwa vering defender of the faith and of all the basic principles and doctrines of Christianity. All of his defenders should be suspected and his sympa thizers should be asked to depart In peace. It was both generous and kind In the Fayetteville chamber of commerce to tender the miliary academy to the Greensboro Norcrral 50 sadly and Furi ously afflicted with a terrible disease. LN

BlK Tobacco Sale To Build a Peanut Factory - The Projrreswtlve Associa tion Confederate Monument New Railroad Trucking l!uslnr!. (Correspondence of The Messenger.) Tarboro, N. C. December 5. The biggest tobacco sale of the sea son was here today. Both warehouses were filled with the weed. The sales approximated 160,000 pounds. One of the buyers, Mr. C. A. Walker, bought In the neighborhood of 40,000 pounds. The town is full of planters from sev eral of the eastern counties. The mar ket Is gradually forging ahead. Tarboro claims to be the biggest pea nut market In the state. Edgecombe will raise about 00,000 bushels of pea nuts this season. It is one of the big gest crors known for some time. The Progressive Association held its regular meeting here Monday. This association discussed the question of organizing a peanut mill here. It will not be a lout; time before a mill will be started In this county. When our farmers begin to realize how much money this mill will put In their pock ets, they will go into this enterprise with enthusiasm and vigor. This as sociation is comiosed mostly of farm ers, who meet once a month for the purpose of discussing matters of in terest to the agriculturists. Steps were taken by this association today look ing toward the erection of a monument to the confederate dead. Mr. II. L. Staton offered the following resolu tion: "A due regard for Edgecombe's good name and fame makes It Incumbent on the Progressive Association, as a high and patriotic duty, to put in per manent and lasting form the great manifestation to dutv and love of country as displayed in our late civil war, therefore to thi;? end It is "Resolved, That an organization, headed by her daughters, the source and inspiration always of her best achievements, be formed, aided by her heroic sons, to "acquire ail necessary information nnd put in permanence a record of her glorious achievements In that grand struggle, "Resolved, That to perpetuate their work, and in addition thereto, the Pro gressive Association, speaking for Edgecombe's manhood, gives full as surance that a suitable monument shall be erected." The following committees were ap pointed: Central Committee Mrs. Anna How ard, Mrs. Mattie Philips, Mrs. Annie Gray Nash, Mrs. Laura P. Bridgers, Miss Sallie Staton, Mrs. Maggie Speight. Miss Betti- Whitehead, Mrs. Sidie Killibrew, Miss Lucy Staton, Mrs. Pattie D. Hart. Auxiliary Committee General W. R. Cox, Captain T. 17. Gatlin. Captain W. II. Powell, Captain Gray Brown, Cap tain Orren Williams, Captain Edward Foxhall, Lieutenant W. M. Howard, Sergeant J. H. Baker, Sergeant J. M. Johnson. Steps will be taken at once to have this monument erected. Several at tempt? have been made heretofore to erect a monument of this kind, but they have all failed. It looks now as if it will materialize. Work on the court house has begun. The contractors have torn away the old vaults in the rear of the building. Large fire proof vaults will be put In. The court room will also be altered. The sheriff's office, and that of the register of deeds will be changed. It is thought now that the building will be heated by steam or hot water. When completed it will be one of the best arranged court houses in the state. Work is ranidlv nroarressing on the new rallioad. A large number of hands are now working on the bridge that crosses Ilendrick's creek, near the riv er. Mr. T. II. Gatling, Jr., tells me that this bridge will be completed by the 1st of January. As soon as this is done, the new system can then run their trains into Tarboro. Judging from the section of the country through which this road will run, it certainly ought to bea splendid in vestment for the owners. I learn that several truckers near Conetoe are selling their lettuce at a handsome profit this season. Trucking In this county is becoming a large thing. One gentleman near town has over ten acres in onions. THE INHERITANCE TAX. Its Constitutionality Argued In tho Federal Supreme Court. Washington, December 5. Argu ment was begun today In the United States supreme court In the cases in volving the constitutionality of the provision in the war revenue act for the taxation of inheritances. The appellants attack the low on the ground that It provides for a di rect tax which is not apportioned among the states according to popu lation as required by the constitution, that eren if not a direct tax. It is un constitutional because It is not uniform in its operation, exempting as it does legacies under $10,000; that if inheri tances are taxable at all the power to Impose such a tax rests with the states exclusively. Tho Branchvllle Express Robber Cap tured. Orangeburg. S. C. December 6. Bar tow Warren, a white man of unknown antecedents, charged with robbing an express train near Branchville last Friday of $1,700, was arrested In Charleston and brought here today.

On 'the other hand there are thosi who say that the corporations which have domesticated themselves have given up any rights of transfer. It was said a few days ago 'thai a test of "the law would be made by some insurance company not domesticated applying for license, and upon refusal, to bring a tent suit. But the case up is that of a celephone com pany from Durham. J. It.

The directors hoped to be able to give up this lease, as well as all the others it will surrender at the end of this year. There is a great demand for an Au ditorium here, and It is hoped that the Masons, who propose to build a tem ple, can arrange for an auditorium therein. Theopilus White, populist, whom the supreme court nustains aa chief shell fish commissioner, will be allowed by that court, it is said today, the $75 a month salary, which he formerly re ceived.
