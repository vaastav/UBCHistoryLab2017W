Elliott Create* a ii 8«nwtlon In Iowa. S FORT DOIGE, Dee. 6.—The Indict ment of \V. A. Elliott, superintendent of the poor farm of Pocahontas County, by the grand jury for alleged cruelty .and malfeasance of duty, has created a sensation. The evidence before the grand jury, it is claimed, revealed shocking abuses in the treatment of the inmates of the poorfarm and the insane ward, especially the weak^mind ed women. Some time ago Pocahontas county removed its insane patients from the care of the state at the Inde pendence hospital and tried the exper iment of keeping them as a local charge. The recent report of the state board of control revealed multiplied cases of cruelty and recommended that .... the legislature enact measures making the maintenance of insane at state asylums mandatory. A SAD TRAGEDY AT BIOVIIXB. Young Woman Shot and Killed, Probably Accidentally. Siocx CITT, Dec. 7.—Miss Sarah Mc Dermott, of Moville, shot and killed herself under peculiar circumstances. She was in the presence of her lover, Hank Stevenson. It is said that the young woman asked the man if he had 6een her new present. He replied in the negative, and she walked over to a trunk, taking from it a 22-caliber re volver. It was nnloaded and she handed it to Stevenson. Later, how ever, she put two cartridges in the cylinder, there was a snap and a re port, and the girl fell dead with a bul let just over her heart. Stevenson de clares he did not see how it happened, and there is no reason that can be seen to doubt his word. ONE OF TWELVE BEST Iowa Newspapers In The Highest Rank. DES MOINES, Iowa, Dec. 2.—The New York National Advertiser, a prominent journal for newspaper men, recently published a list of "the twelve best and most progressive American daily newspapers," including the Des Moines Daily News as one of them.

The News now has over 27,000 circulation., which is more than any four other Iowa dailies combined. It belongs to the Associated Press and publishes all the news condensed for the busy reader.

DES MOINES, Dec. 5.—John Simson YVoolson, United States district judge for the southern district of Iowa, died at his residence in Des Moines yester day, after an illness of about five weeks. Judge Woolson's death was unexpected up to Sunday by the at tending physicians and the members of the family, and was a complete sur prise to his many friends and acquain tances in the city. Five weeks ago, while holding court in Keoltuk, he was taken suddenly ill and was compelled to adjourn the term and return imme diately to his home in Des Moines. At that time he was suffering from a nervous break-down, the result of overwork.

Des Moines dispatch: Adjutant Gen eral Byers has submitted to the gover nor his biennial report covering the period ending November 30, 1899. It is one of the largest reports made tc the governor from this office since the civil war and contains much oi historical interest relative to the part Iowa troops took in the Spanish-Amer ican and Philippine wars. In addition there are some recommendations that will be of particular interest to mem bers of the guard, among which arc those that the election of officers be abolished and that they be appointed, that the guard be made a part of the national military forces in fact as well as name, some recommendations with reference to the re-organization, a rec ommendation that a new!. arsenal be built in Des Moines and another that a permanent camp ground with perm anent improvements be provided for the troops and one that otticcrs of the regular army be detailed to service with regiments and companies with a view of promoting their efficiency and several others of almost equal impor tance. Des Moines dispatch: Adjutant Gen eral Byers, accompanied by Private Secretary Fleming, of the governor's office, called on the officials of the Rock Island road Saturday and pre sented them with a New York draft for 831,097. This covers the figures of the contract made by state authorities with the Rock Island road for trans porting the Fifty-first Iowa regiment from San Francisco to Council Bluffs, lacking 8253 which is withheld for the price of two meals caused by the delay of the last section on the Union Pacific road. The amount withheld will be taken from the sub-contract of the Union Pacific with the Rock Island, the former being responsible for the delay. Money has been advanced to meet all the bills incurred in bringing the soldiers home, including besides the transportation, 87,400 for other ex penses. The meals cost 82,941, the Pullman charges were 82,560, and there were smaller bills,including telegraph, etc., all of which have been met by the state through its governor. It is understood that the largest part of the expenses have been paid by the gov ernor himself, and the remainder has been covered by temporary loans from different banks of the state. The entire sum, it is expecte.!, will be re funded by the legislature, the uiajor itv of the members, it is understood, .—J_ -'-J—^ themselves ftfr having already pl« tto return. )WBWBI|WTO^^rp!lTO5^TOTr«ww^^^ wK i^l !r* *"V In beginning hi3 review of national and international relations and ques tions the president calls attention to the present conditions o£ unusual pros perity, of universal good will among the people at home and the relations of peace and friendship that exist with every government of the world. As an element of this unusual prosperity our foreign commerce, it is stated, has shown great increase in volume and value, the combined imports and ex ports for the twelvemonth being the greatest ever recorded in a single year of our history. It 13 mentioned as a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and 1S99. Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, aggregated $610,982,004.35 expendi tures were ?700,093,564.02, leaving a de ficit of $89,111,559.07. The estimated receipts for the current year aggregat ed $40,958,112 estimated expendi tures, $600,958,112, leaving a surplus of $40,000,000. The strength of the treasury is grati fying. On Dec. 1, 1S99, the available cash balance was $278,004,S37.72, of which $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. Customs receipts are now almost entirely paid in gold. Owing to this favorable condition of the treasury with respect to the cash on hand compliance with the provisions of the sinking fund, disregarded for eight years on account of deficiencies In the revenues, was resumed, the treasury department purchasing dur ing November $18,408,500 of the 5 per cent loan of 1904, thus making a net saving of about $2,885,000 in interest. The government will continue to pur chase bonds to the extent of $25,000,000 in all provided these are offered and purchased up to and including Dec. 23. Increased activity in industry and agriculture and consequent terser em ployment of labv~at higher wages adds to the capacity of the people to absorb the circulating medium. These changed and changing conditions have Impaired the national banking act as to making the needful addition to the circulation. The attention of congress is therefore invited to this subject with II rtCff tiV uittMU5"Vni5-ttV#* u*w«v- eponsive to the people's needs. The presided again urges, therefore, that national banks be authorized to organ ize with a capital of $25,000. He also recommends that the secretary of the treasury be given additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to maintain the parity in value of the two metals, gold and sil ver, and the equal power of every dol lar at all times in the market and in the payment of debts. Gold now seeks the treasury, but adequate provision should be made to insure the continu ance of the gold standard and of pub lic confidence In the ability of the gov ernment to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized world recognizes as the best. In this con nection the president repeats his form er recommendation that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except in gold. Relating to American merchant ma rine it is recommended that legisla tion should be enacted which will give to the country maritime strength com mensurate with its industrial achieve ments and its rank among the nations of the earth. Only in this way can we secure our share In the valuable car rying trade of the world. The present situation in this respect, the president, says, is regarded with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad. On the subject of trusts the presi dent declares they are justly provoking public discussion and should claim the attention of congress. The indus trial commission, created by act of congress June 18, 1898, has not yet completed its investigations of this subject Whatever power congress has in the way of controlling or check ing these monopolies should be promptly ascertained and asserted. At tention is canea to tne recommenda tions of President Harrison in his an nual message of Dec. 3, 1889, and to that of President Cleveland in bis an nual message of Dec. 7, 1896, as well as to the act of July, 1890, bearing upon this subject. It is noted that the state legislation to which President Cleveland looked for relief from the evil of trusts has failed fully to accom plish that object, owing principally to the fact that different states take dif ferent views as to the proper way to discriminate between evil and injuri ous combinations and those associa tions which are beneficial and neces sary to the business prosperity of the country. The president adds that uni formity In state legislation on this subject Is much to be desired and ex presses the hope that means may be found for congress within the limita tions of constitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete sys tem of laws and compel a general ob servance of the salutary rules to which he refers.

PRESIDENT'S Condensed Report of His Third Annual Address to Congress# Washington Special: President Mc Kinley's message to the LVIth con gress was one of the lengthiest ever submitted to the senate and house of representatives of the United States. The death of Vice-President Hobart, who passed from this life on the morn ing of Nov. 21 last, is menCioned as an event, congress is called to mourn at the .threshold of its deliberations. The president pronounces a high enconlum upon a private life which was pure and el.-vated and a public career distin guished i»y large capacity, stainless in tegrity and exalted motives. jt 'iSa lie and Chile, in which" the United States minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire. A convention of extradi tion between Argenuna and the United States awaits some slight changes in the text before exchange. Reference is made to the claim of the Austro-Hungarian government for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian subjects at Lattimer, Pa., Sept. 10, 1S97. As the sheriff and his deputies tried for their murder were acquitted by the courts this govern ment, after due consideration, declined to indemnify the sufferers. Note is made of various minor diffi culties and insurrections in certain South American and Central American republics and the changes resulting. The Blueiields controversy Is still un settled. The events of the past year looking tn an Isthmian canal are recapitulated and reasons for early action in the matter are urged. Events in China as far as concerns American interests are recounted and the-extension of the area opened to foreign settlement is referred to. The significant statement is made on this subject that our commercial rights in China under existing treaties have been everywhere maintained during the past year, as they will be in the future. A commission to study the commercial and industrial conditions in the Chinese empire is recommended. No time should be lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for American trade and enter prise. The Paris exposition and the prepar ations of this country to take part in it are related at length, and the Im portance of a representative display is urged. The United States government building, now approaching completion, will be worthy in beauty of architec tural plan and in completeness of dis play to represent this nation. There will be over 7,000 exhibitors for every state of our country, not including ex hibits from Cuba, Porto Rico and Ha waii, for which arrangements hava been made. Our relations with Germany con tinue to be most cordial and the state ment is made that in all the promises closer relations of intercourse and commerce and a better understanding between two races having so many traits in common Germany can be as sured of the most cordial co-operation of this government and people. Vari ous matters pertaining to certain re strictions of trade between the two countries and also the satisfactory set tlement of most of them and a recom mendation for a joint commission of experts and practical men of affairs for the investigation of production and exportation in both countries is urged. As to affairs with Great Britain the work of the joint high commission is monious modus vivendi in the Alaskan boundary dispute gives hope of a per manent satisfactory settlement. In other matters the relations between the United States and Canada and Great Britain remain most friendly. In tho unfortunate contest between the Boer states of Africa and Great Britain this government has maintain ed an attitude of neutrality. In the exercise of customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British inter ests opportunity has been afforded to show the impartiality of this govern ment toward both combatants. As to the deplorable events at Tallu lah, La., when five Italians were taken from jail and hanged, the president states that a satisfactory solution of the dispute between the two govern ments in regard to the matter will doubtless be reached. The recurrence of such events leads the president to recommend the conferring upon the federal courts jurisdiction in this class of cases. Mention is made in speaking of our relations with Japan of the treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan on Nov. 22, 1894, which became operative in July last. It is also stated that Japan 13 taking a lively Interest in the propo sition of the Pacific cable company to add to its projected cable lines to Ha waii, Guam and the Philippines a branch connection with the coast of Japan, whereby the latter would be brought into direct communication with this country. Without repeating his previous recommendations on this subject the president respectfully calls the attention of congress to them and recommends that the postmaster-gen eral be authorized to invite competi tive bids for the establishment of such cable. A review of our relations with Mex ico shows a gratifying record of mu tual good will, one of the latest in stances being the acceptance of Presi dent Diaz of an invitation to visit Chi cago last October, but the illness of a member of bis family prevented his attendance. Claims growing out of the seizure of American sealing vessels in Bering W* sea by Russia have been under discussion for several year3 with the recent happy result of an agreement to submit them to the decision of a single arbitrator. The Important events leading to the dissolution of the tripartite agreement as regards the Satnoan islands are recounted and also the satisfactory partition of the islands between Ger many and the United States, Great Britain being given by Germany an equivalent elsewhere. A convention has been made by the three powers to which the attention of the senate will be invited. Concerning events and conditions growing ont of the recent war with Spain the message treats very fully. As to Cuba, held by us In trust for the Inhabitants with the intent of realiz ing uie high purpose proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by the con gress on the 19th of April, 1198, the president states that the pledge con tained In. this resolution Is of the high est honorable obligation and most be kgpi. All the administration meuoa*« +7**®^'*- adopted heretofore in Cuba by this government have aimed to fit it for a regenerated existence and for self-gov ernment within its own sphere. Free Cuba, however, must be a reality, not a name. A loosely-framed common wealth is not to be turned adrift to face the vicissitudes of weaker states, but wise preparation must be made for eventual self-government of re sponsible character. In the Turkish empire the situation of our citizens remains unsatisfactory and claims of many years' standing have not yet been collected, though our government is hopeful In this re gard. Attention is called to the arrange ments made for collecting official and economic data under the international union of American republics and also to the commercial museum of Phila delphia in furtherance of this idea and the Pan-American exposition of 1901 on the Niagara frontier. The president gives a resume of the Hague conference and its results in the amelioration of the laws and cus toms of wa and says that the historlo position of the United States as to en tanglements with foreign nations was duly observed. In regard to the army, especially in the Philippines, the message gives fig ures and facts showing the actua'l number returned, tic. Mr. McKinley* recommends a special medal of honor1 for volunteers, regulars, sailors and marines on duty in the Philippines who remained in tervice after their terms of enlistment expired. The totat number of troops now in the Philip pines and those on the way comprise 2,051 officers and €3,483 men. The de velopment of the festal system in Porto Rico and the Philippines is stat ed to have been rapid and successful and to be growing with extraordinary popularity in the domestic service or In the United States proper. As to the navy high praise is given it for its efficiency and recommendations are made for necessary legislation and aid in the matter of naval construction as suggested by tlie secretary of the navy. The statements of the message as to the future of the Philippines are clear and unequivocal. The rebellion must be put down and civil government re stored. Free public schools must be established and the burden of gov ernment equally distributed. Already hundreds of schools are open and filled with children. Religious free dom is sacredly assured and enjoyed. The courts are dispensing Justice and business is beginning to circulate in its accustomed channels. The future government of the islands rests with the congress of the United States, and the president adds that a few graver responsibilties have ever been confided to us. If we accept them In a spirit worthy our race and traditions a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we de sert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. No specific or final form of government for the islands is recommended. When noano la—T'atjtr»rorl If .will ha of congress to construct a pTan oi gov1 ernment which shall establish free dom and order in the Philippines. Un til congress makes known the final ex pression of its will the president must use the authority vested in him to up hold the sovereignty of the United States in the islands. When the in surrection ends it will be the hour of peace and clemency. The text of the message, referring to the Philippines, is in full: On Dec. 10. 1S98, the treaty of peace be tween the United States and Spain was signed. It provided, among other things, that Spain should cede to the United States the archipelago known as the Phil ippine Islands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of $20. 

OOC.OOO, and that the civil rights and political status of the native Inhabitants of the territories thus ceded to the United States should be determined by the congress. The treaty was ratltled by the senate on the 6th of February, 1S93, and by the government of Spain on March 19 following. The ratifications were exchanged on April 11, and the treaty publicly proclaimed. On March 2 the congress voted the sum contemplated by the treaty and the amount was paid over to the Spanish government on May 1st. In this manner tho Philippines came to the United States. The Islands were ced ed by the givernment of Spain, which had been In undisputed possesion of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely by our authorized commissioners in Paris, under the direction of the ex ecutive, but by the constitutional and well-considered action of the representa tives of the peocle of the United States in both houses of congress, had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was in ac cordance with tho wishes and the aspir ations of the great mass of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment no oppor tunity was lost of assuring the people of the islands of our ardent desire for their welfare and of tho Intention of this government to do everything possible to advance their interests. In my order of the 19th of May. 1S98. tho commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was instructed to declare that we came not to make war upon the people of that country, "nor upon any psrty or faction among them, but to pro tect them in their homes, In their em ployments and in their personal and re ligious rights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority there, on the 17th of Au&ust It was di rected that "there must be no joint oc cupation wish the Insurgents that the United States must preserve the peace and protect persons and property withhi the territory occupied by their military and naval forces: that the Insurgents and all others must recognize tbe mili tary occupation and authority of th« United States. As early as December 4, before the cossion. and In anticipation of that event, the commander in Manila was urged to restore peace and tranquil lity and to undertake the establishment of a beneficent government, which should afford the fullest security for life and property. On the 21«t of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of the forces of occupation was Instructed "to announce and proclaim in the most pub llo manner that we come not as invad ers and conquerors but as friends to pro tect the natives In their homes, in their employments and In the personal and re ligious rights." On the same day, while ordering Oen. Otis to see that the peace should be preserved in Hollo, he was ad monished that: "It Is most Important that there should be no conflict with the Insurgents." On the first day of Jan uary, 1899, urgent orders were reiterated that the kindly intentions of this govern ment should be in every possible way communicated to the insurgents. On the 21st of January I announced my Intention of dispatching to Manila a commission composed of three gentlemen of the highest character and distinction, tftproufhlz waist#!, with, tha orient, BWippiih6^ ^-ranon, holier ot certificate, ^aftloy, Agent f~*-fPHg •'', -'v .*?!• who, ffi association with Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis, were instructed to "facilitate the most humane and ef fective extension of authority throughout the islands and to secure with the least possible delay the benefits of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the Inhabitants." These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman, president of Cornell univer sity the Hon. Charles Denby, for many years minister to China, and Prof. Dean C. Worcester of the University of Mich igan, who had made a most careful study of life In the Philippines. But before their arrival at Manila the sinister am bition of a few leaders of the FiliplftJ* had created a situation full of embar rassments for us and most grievous in Its consequences to themselves. The clear'and impartial preliminary report of the commissioners gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present Insurrectionary movement that the story need not be hero repeated. It Is enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader that he was promised Independence by any ofHcer of the United States in return for his assistance has no foundation in fact and 1b categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove It. The most the insurgent leader hop ed for when he came back to Manila was the liberation of the islands from the Spanish control, which they had beer laboring for years without success tc throw off. The prompt accomplishment of this work by the American army and navy gave him other ideas and ambitions and Insidious suggestions from various quar ters perverted the purposes and inten tions with which he had taken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manlia than the Filipino forces began to as sume an attitude of suspicjon and hos tility, which the utmost efforts of our officers and troops were unable to dl3arm or modify. Their kindness and forbear ance were taken as a proof of coward ice. The aggressions of the Filipinos continually increased until finally, just before the time set by the senate of the United States for a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently prepared in ad vance, was mode all along the Aniprloin nnes, wnich resulted In a terribly de structive and sanguinary repulse of the insurgents. Ten days later an order of the Insur gent government was issued to its ad herents who had remained in Manila, of which Gen. Otis Justly observes that "for barbarous intent It is unequaled In mod ern times." It directs that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 15th of February the territorial militia shall come together in the streets of San Pedro, armed with their bolos, with guns and ammunition where convenient that Filipino families only shall be respected but that all other Individuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be exterminated without uny compassion, after the extermination of the army of occupation, and adds: "Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the Americans and exterminate them, that me may take out revenge for the infamies rind treacheries which they have committed upon us. Have no compas sion upon them attack with vigor." A copy of this fell by good fortune into the hands of our officers and they were able to take measures to control the ris ing, which was actually attempted .on the night of Feb. 22, a week later than was originally contemplated. Considerable numbers of armed Insurgents entered the city by waterways and swamps and In concert with confederates Inside attempt ed to destroy Manila by fire. They were kept in check during the .night and the next day driven out of tbe city with heavy loss. This was the unhappy condition of af fairs which confronted our commission ers on their arrival in Manila. They had come with the hope and Intention of co operating with Admiral Dewey and Major-Gen. Otis In establishing peace and order in the archipelago and the largest measure of self-government com patible with the true welfare of the peo ple. What they actually found can best be set forth in their own words: "Deplorable as war Is, the one in which we are now engaged was unavoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adven turous and enthuiastlc army. No alterna tive was left to us, except Ignominous retreat. "It is not to be conceived of that any render of Manila to_tlie IfitilrfeUtt our obligations. to other nations and to the friendly Filipinos and to our selves and our flag demanded that force should be met by force. Whatever the future of the Philippines may be, there is no course open to us now except the prose cution of the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission. The commis sion is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Span ish squadron by Admiral Dewey- when it was possible to withdraw our forces from the islands, either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inhabit ants." The course thus clearly indicated has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel lion must be put down. Civil govern ment cannot be thoroughly established until order is restored. With a devotion und gallantry worthy of Its most bril liant history, the army, ably and loyally assisted by the navy, has carried on this unwelcome, but most righteous cam paign with richly deserved success.
