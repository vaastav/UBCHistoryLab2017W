The ginner'8 report showed a crop bor dering on fourteen million bales?by far the largest ever made. We confess that we thought then that the notion of the price climbing to ten cents before the coming in of an other crop seemed to us foolish. We were mistaken. It is just as reasonable, more rea sonable perhaps, for cotton to sell at 15 cents the pound in June 1906 than it was for it to sell at 10 cents in June 1905. Nevertheless, if we had cotton we would take eleven cents for it. However, if there is a man in Lau rens county who thinks he knows more about cotton than The Advertiser, we entirely agree with him. We are sure he does. * Laurens is about the only town of importance not scheduled for a court house in the bills that have been intro duced Congress, providing for the establishment of a United States Court in the Western District of South Caro lina. One of the first bills passed at the present session of Congress was the voting of an appropriation of eleven million dollars toward the construction of the Panama Canal. The amount, it is said, will carry on the work until the first of March. President Roosevelt's annual message to Congress, containing twenty-two thousand words, was read, last Tues day. 

PATENT MEDICINE ADS. Our able brother of The Laurens Ad vertiser, whose head is so level that quick silver wouldn't run off of it, may depend upon the Press and Banner agreeing to what that paper has to say of the mistakes which country editors make in publishing patent medicine ads. This office has a regular price for its space, and those who cannot pay it cannot get the space. We try to treat every customer fairly and justly. To do this, it is better to lose an ad now and than, than to be unjust to our neigh bors. This editor is not now running the business department of the office, but at the time we sold out there was not, with a single exception, an ad that did not pay ten cents an inch. In that exception it was a big ad and the usual agent's commission was conceded. The above from the Press and Ban ner is good hard sense. It took us quite a while to learn it, but we have adopted a Hat rate of ten cents per inch, and the foreign advertiser who gets in our columns must pay the same rate that is paid by our home people, and he can no longer have special position, even if he pays for it, because if such a contract is made with the foreign advertiser he will always find some technical excuse for avoiding payment. Another rule which we have adopted, and which we expect to follow, is that no display ad vertisements can have place on our first page. We believe it is best for the advertiser and best for the paper. ?Newberry Herald and News. Product of Mills. The product in one day of the Long man & Martinez great works is enough to paint every house and everything made of wood in a city with the L. & M Paint. In use thirty years; several houses painted with L. & M. L. & M. costs about $1.20 per gallon. The L. & M. is the best and cheap est, because the L. & M. Zinc, hardens the L. & M. White Lead, and makes it paint more surface and wear a longer time than any other paint. L. & M. costs about $1.20 a gallon. It only requires 4 gallons of this cele brated and 3 gallons of Linseed Oil at 60 cents per gallon to paint a moderate sized house. Therefore a property owner ought not pay $1.50 per gallon for Linseed Oil, which he must do when a ready-for-use paint is bought. L. & M. costs about $1.20 a gallon. W. L. Boyd, Laurens, S. C.

LAURENS CASE. Many More Like It la Laurens. , The following case is but one of many similar occuring daily in Laurens. It is an easy matter to verify its correct ness. Surely you cannot ask for bet ter proof than such conclusive evidence: Lee Bishop, of Laurens, S. C. pro frietor of a general store, on Mill St., 'actory Hill, says: "I can from ex perience recommend Doan's Kidney Pills. My back and kidneys have given me great trouble for a long time, not only costing me untold misery, but costing me a great many dollars. There was a dull toothache like pain con stantly across the small of my back and after sitting for a bit I could scarcely get up. Sharp shooting pain sometimes ran down to first one knee and then another, and I never knew when it was going to strike me. The secretions from the kidneys were too frequent in action and disturbed my night rest so that I would arise in the morning feeling worse than I did the night before. Y tried numerous reme dies, but did not get any positive relief from anything until I learned about Doan's Kidney Pills and procured them. The next day after using them I felt better, and I continued taking them until the kidney secretions become regu lar. I could go bed and get a good night's rest, and the aching in my back disappered.
