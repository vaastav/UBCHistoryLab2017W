V FIRM ON THE CAROLINES HcriBIow aFccble Oue.Bnt Spain Has the Fun of Getting; lu the Last Lick. Paris, Dec 8. The United States and the Spanish peace commissioners finish ed their -work today and finally settled the plrvas of the treaty of peace. They will sit once more in formal session, on Saturday or Slonday next, when the Spanish commissioners, eo sorrowfully, and the Americans, wieh feelings of re lief, -Rill -write their signatures upon the document -which embodies the results of the -war and the preparation of -which has consumed eleven -weeks, a longer time than the "war itself. In the meantime the treaty -will he en grossed undtr the supervision of Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda, the secretaries of -the respective commissions. The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter over the result, though observing the forms of friendliness and courtesy to the end. Senor Monttro Rios, -whose strong and persistent struggle to save for his country every tporalble asset from the wreck of her colonial empire has com manded the re.cpect and admiration of his opponents, -.vent from the council cham btr today to his bed, in u state of com plete collate, as the result of the long strain and his chagrin over the small fruits of his efforts. Senor Ojeda has "been prostrated since yesterday and -was unable to attend the joint session today. The Spaniards charge equal -blame upon the European powers and the United States for their downfall. One of the Spanish commissioners said this evening: y "The European nations have made a sreat mistake in deserting Spain and leaving her to spoliation Jby the brute force of a conscienceless giant. They all know that in the Philippines America, has t. .ken more than, she can digest. She will ultimately sell the Islands to England or Germany and when the transfer Is at tempted it will precipitate general Euro pean strife. -We havt refused to sell any island in the CaroMnes. AVe never thought of con sidering an offer. Nor have we consent ed to negotiate upon any questions except those directly Involved in thb wrotocol, signed at Washington. AMERICANS WERE NERVOUS. The American peace commissioners en tered the joint conference today in a nervous frame of mind. They evidently had reasons to believe that a possibility existed, oven at this late hour, tliat there might be a rupture. This feeling of ap prehension was based on the temper tho Spaniards have displayed lately. All the week the commissioners of Spain have not concealed the fact that having failed to g.i.n all the important points, they were indifferent ns to whether or not tho con ferences resuJed in a settlement of peace j I the signing of a traty in which Spain . '-es ail her colonics. A miscarriage of tho negotiations would leave their polit ical precise at home no -worse, if not in a better poshon than if they signed the treaty. The Americans were anxious not to give the Spaniards any pretext to back off the negotiations, or to take offense to far as the exercise of patience and diplomacy could stet r clear of protests. REVIVAL OF THE MAINE. The Mid rid papers have been disposed to revive the question of the Maine and excite uhlir opinion against the United States on account of the reference made to thif subject in President McKinley's message to congress. They have report ed that Senor Montero Rios. president of the Spanish peace commission, mude an fcnpnsskmtd denunciation of President McKinley at the tei joint meeting of the i-ommisston. But these reports Hre prac tically without foundation. Ser R - .j.,i refer to the Maine, but v n,. iimly worded fcontence. ex r - 'im that the president had !. -s 'i- Spaniards thought, unjust- " t i in "Hn.

Senor ontero Rios, president of the Span ish commission, acceded to this, and the American bowed themselves out before the Spaniards, according to their custom. 

FRANCE'S TURN COMES NEXT. Diplomatic circles in Paris predict, as one of the results of the treaty, a diplo matic contest between France and the United States, which will prove an impor tant chapter in history. The French government is reported to have resolved to take up the case of the French holders of Cuban bonds, and it is believed that France will declare that the repudiation of the bonds is the result of the treaty which teh victorious nation im posed upon Spain. They argue that through the treaty responsibility has been shifted upon America, and therefore the French government will endeavor to exact some pledge for the payment or guarantee of the bonds. SORE ON THE MAINE QUESTION. Madrid, Dec. S. The Imparclal today says the Spanish government yesterday decided to telegraph to Senor Montero Rios, president of the Spanish peace com mission, at Paris, instructing him to again protest against President McKinley's ref erence to the Maine in his recent message to conrress. Continuing, the Imparclal says there is great indignation at the American com missioners' rejection of Senor Rios' request for a neutral investigation into the cause of the loss of the Maine. A semi-official note just Issued says: "Spain has been treated by the conqueror with unexampled cruelty and is resinned to her fate, but she cannot tolerate Presi dent McKinley's accusation, for she is conscious of her complete innocence. "It Is understood that the government has decided to end the Paris conference on the ground that the discussion of second ary questions is impossible." j 

SPANISH STUBBORNNESS. London, Dec. 9. The Madrid corres pondent of the Standard says: "The strongest comments are made upon the little disposition the United States has shown to respond to the Spanish demands for a prompt release of the 11.000 Spanish prisoners in the hands of the Tagals and a restitution of private and official deposits now lying in the colonial office and judicial deposit banks. "Everything seems to show that the last stage In the negotiations has taken a turn hardly calculated to pacify Spanish public opinion or to facilitate for a long time to come the Tenewal of friendly relations be tween tne two governments. Most of the newspapers favor the idea of selling the Carolines and the other possessions of Spain In the Pacic to Germany or to some other nation willing to pay a better price than ithe United States." DON'T "WANT IT TO COME THAT "WAY. London. Dec. 9. The Madrid correspond ent oi tne ually News says: "The prayer of the chaplain of the Unit ed States senate, invoking the blessing of heaven on Spain, ia much resented in high circles.

The Spaniards refuse to admit that they had failed to respect former treaties guar anteeing religious freedom in the Caroline Islands, or that there were a neces4ty for new guarantees. The conclusion of the work was, according to the commission ers, marked by politeness and all outward evidences of good feeling and relief at the fact that the task was accomplished.

Rochester, N. 1'., Dec. S. The eleventh annual banquet of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce was held tonight in the Mir oror room of Powers' Art gallery, nearly &0o guests being present. Governor Leslie M. Shaw of Iowa responded to tho toast, "The Financial Need of Today." Dr. David J. Hill, assistant secretary of state, spoke on "The Greater America." He sid ian part: "Now that victory has placed the fate of 12,000,000 human beings in the hands of a conquering nation, with what right does a spirit of criticism which derives its in spirations from conditions thata have ceased, stamp with the word Imperialism the magnaniminity of this republic in ex tending the sheltering wings of its protec tion over those whom the war has liber ated from oppression and misery? "What now will our national lecls'.ators do with the territories ceded by Spain to the United States? "Will they restore them to the vengeance of the vanquished; will thy leave them to the occupation and par tition of other powers; will they abandon them to their own inexperience and in ternal discord: or will they attempt to establish within them the principles of peace and self-government? "There is nothing novel in the idea of territorial expansion, which has marked every period of our national history. Only a little strip of territory along the Atlantic seaboard was people by the victorious col onies at the close of the war of independ ence, but tho American commissioners wero instructed to claim for the colonies the whole area east of the Mississippi. Franklin, the most astute diplomatist of his time, coveted, in addition, the whole of Canada. "In 1S03 Jefferson strained tho constitu tion to the breaking point, as he believed, to secure the purchase of the great pro vince of Louisiana, which at once stroke doubled the area of the country. His op ponents considered his act not only uncon stitutional but, in effect, a dissolution of the Union, and a historian has accused him of 'making himself monarch of the new territory and of holding, against its protests, the power of its old kings. "Jackson did not hesitate to invade and conquer Florida for the peace of the na tion. Texas came into tho Union by revo lution, and the entire tract which now forms the prosperous states stretchins from Mexico to Oregon was tho fruit of war and forced opinion. "Thus, by continued teritorial expansion, the better part of this continent has be come incorporated into the United States. "Having won from nature and untitled claimants the possession of what is most desirable upon this continent, snail we henceforth renounce all dominion upon-the sea? "Jefferson, indeed, once said that our national ambition should be limited to pos sessions that would not need a navy ;o de fend them, but that was long ago." In conclusion. Mr. Hill said: "A slant's task now confronts the American Deo:le, but their history gives the assurance that they will not tremble before it and the din of war and the strife of nations. In the busy marts of trade and among the dis tant islands of the sea, dwells an unseen force slolly shaping the destinies of the world. It speaks alike in nature, in the human sour and in the long drama of his tory. "Witness a nation rising to the full splendor of its responsibilities and you will see there written in letters of shining light the august and imperative law of univer sal development."

Roberts, representative-elect from Utah, from taking his seat in the Fifty sixth congress because he is a polygamist and advocates that doctrine of the mon church, is to have the organized sup port of hundreds of thousands of women In the United States, The initial woman's movement is to take organized form in tfrss city at a meeting of the Presbyte rian Woman's Board of Home Missions on December 20. There are 100,000 members, of the Pres byterian Home Missions society alone, in the United States. The home missions societies of the Congregational and Bap tist churches are preparing to make a similar campaign against Roberts and the women's societies of other denominations are becoming interested, in the fight. It is Intended that all shall co-operate. The Congregational Homo Mlssionary society will take the matter up at a meet ing to be held at the St. Dennis hotel in 'January- This movement is not to be confined to missionary societies, but is to be started through them as a convenient way of arousing interest over the entire country. The women are to give information re garding the Roberts case and the sup posed danger of polygamy and to unite In obtaining personal letters to represent atives in al ldistricts throughout the country protesting against the seating of an avowed polygamist. Rev. 'William R. Campbell, who has spent twelve years in Utah among the Mormons, is in New York taking an act- dve part in the fight against polygamy. He, with another speaker who has lived among the Mormons, will probably ad dress tho coming meetings. Mr. Campbell will dwell especially on the revival of polygamy in Utah. He says that the Pmsbytery of Utah is in touch with only 70 o f the 310 postofllces in Utah. Reports received from these show 2,000 cases of polygamy and that 1,000 polygamist chil dren have been gom since Utah was ad mitted to statehood. In the women's fight against Roberts it is to be -UTgeu thati ho- is seated fhe-! Mormon church will grant dispensations to many men to take more wives.

The murderer was Ernest Clevenger, cousin to the young woman who was one of his victims. The tragedy occurred immediately alter tho congre gation had been dismissed, as the worship pers were leaving the church. Young Al len and Miss Cleveager were walking out together. Ernest Clevenger, armed with a revolver, slipped up behind them, placed the weapon close to Allen's head and fired. His -victim fell dead at his feet, and at the same moment the assassin turned the weapon upon his fair young cousin, shooting her in the back. She fell across the body of her murdered es cort, So horrified were the members of the congregation that there were none to seize the murderer, who ran out of the meeting house and is still at large, thouch at a late hour tonight many men are out searching for him. The indications are that if Clevenger is caught he will be roughly handled. The tragedy was due to young Cleven ger's insane jealousy oi his cousin and K! was intensified by the fact that her father, Joseph Clevenger. had forbidden Ernest to come to their house.

"With him on tho victorious -tickets were tiree social ist candidates for alderraenAand throe for councllmen. Chase declares that his only purpose in the mayor's office will be to carry out the principles of the local party plat'form, which are as follows: Article 1. The acquisition -by the mu nicipality of the .public utilities, such as streeet railways, gas and electric light plants and all other utilities requiring- a lranemse, the same to be operated bv the operatives, co-operatively, subject iy di rect vote to the whole people ;the em plovcs to elect their own superior offi cers, but no employe to bo discharged for political reasons.

He bad been prevl(NH4y emptoyed for tire yeaTs in sooe factories is -rariocs positions. JO years old, with hospital or actlvt pro fessional experience, but when perman ent camps were established In this coun try he did not know they were to bt per manent. He conceded it was a mistake not to have appointed more contract bur geons from those who had experienct In the civil war, for their experience would have been invaluable, but he was ignorant at the outset of the permanency of th camps. It had been impossible for him even to read the great volume of reports submitted, owing to being- overwhrlmed with matters requiring personal atten tion. The regimental surgeons, he said, wero good, bad and indifferent, but he recollected no Instance of dismissal for in competence. THE 

HOSPITAL CONTROVERSY. Threshing over the controversy between regimental and division hospitals he credited the establishment of tho latter to their success in two years' experience in the Civil war. At the outset the maxi mum capacity of the division hospital was 22) beds, but this capacity was quickly found far inadequate. Ho could not rec ollect whether thee hief surgeon at Camp Thomas had reported that fhe sanitation there was bad. The department now. he said, had ample evidence that the typhoid fever cases during the war wort largely mistaken for malarial fever until the cases readied tho division hospitals and that malaria had also been diagnosed as typhoid. TRATNTNG OF NURSES. General Sternberg's recollection was that prior to the inspection tour of the camps by Secretary Alger, Quartermaster General Ludlngton and himself, tho Infor mation in his hands of unsanitary condi tions of Camp Thomas was unofficial. He said that with time it was practicable to secure a fairly large number of nurses but their training took time, which ho ad mitted in war time might be at the ex pense of the patients. Ht ncknowielged the services of volunteer aid associations and said the trains female nursr wore satisfactory, though he had reolived some reports to tho contrary. LACK OF MEDICAL. SUPPLIES. Witness admitted a real deficiency In medical supplie at times. Aa Santiago their landing was delayed owing to the ex igencies of the times: and railroadt failed to get them through in time at other olnts. He contended, howevor. that there had been very little lack of medical pup pHts during tht war, the great difllcuity lelng ttiat surgeons frequently preferred other than the "field supptieg" and ty phoid fever outbreak had aLo consider ably taxed the field rtsources. Purchases, however, had fcen made largely from hand to mouth, due ta lack ot rtomge faclMtie and lack of ti.-.j for calling for Wds. He thought k would save tlmo to hav medical supplies shipped directly to the surgeon in charge at the destination, without depending upon tbe quartormaa- ttr's department for transportation, as ia now nec,ary.

"Then." said General Beaver, "we are to understand that you had at all times the hearty support and good will of tfcoso over you In forwarding the workof your department?" "oYs," was the reply; "most undoubt edly." HOW TO KEEP GOOD CAMPS. As to th general condition of troops in mobilization camps, he waid the trouble couVd nearly all bo summed up In two phraser: "Neglect of sanitary, measure" and "letting the troops remain too long in ono camp" "You have to do one of two things," he said. "You must maintain your perman ent camp under the sanitary condition of civilized life, or you must follow tho Indian method and shift your camp when you foul your ground. I an make rules which, if followed, will insuro reason able Immunity from typhoid, but I can not insure their being followed 'by men In the field." As to a new ration for the tropics.
