CONGRESS WILSONS HEARS MESSAGE Presidents Address to Both Houses Is Quite Short RAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST Further Legislation on That Line It Strongly Recommended Bill Glv Ing Foreign Commerce Promo ters Free Hand Necessary Washington Dec G President Wil ton today delivered his message to both houses of congress In Joint ses sion The nddrcss wns ns follows Gentlemen of the Congress r In f limiting nt this time the duty lnld upon me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union nnd recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures ns may be Judged necessary nnd expedient I shall continue the practice which I hope has been acceptable to you of lenitng to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which It seems neces sary nnd feasible to deal nt the pres ent session of the congress I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily net nt this session nnd shall make my sug gestions ns few ns possible but there were Mime things left undone at the last siMtshui which there will now lie time to complete nnd which It seems necessary in the Interest of the public to do nt once In the first place It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the eaillest possible consideration nnd nctlon should be accorded the remaining mensures of the program of settle ment nnd regulation which I hnd occa sion to recommend to you nt the close of your Inst session In view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated dldicultles which then existed and which still unhappily continue to exist between the railroads of the country nnd their locomotive engineers conductors nnd trainmen Railway Troubles First I then recommended First immediate provision for the enlargement nnd administrative reor ganization of the Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting nctlon by the senate in order that the commission may be ennbled to deal with the many great nnd various duties now devolving upon it with n prompt ness nnd thoroughness which nre with Its present constitution nnd means of action practically Impossible Second the establishment of an eight hour day ns the legal basis alike of work and of wages In the employ ment of nil railway employees who nre actually engaged In the work of oper ating trains In Interstate transporta tion Third the authorization of the ap pointment by the pi Mdent of n small body of men to observe the actunl re sults In experience of the adoption of the eight hour day in railway trnns Hirtntlon nllke for the men and for the railroads Fourth explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the In terstate commerce eoinnilshlon of nn Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads ns may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day nnd which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies should the facts dis closed Justify the Increase Fifth an amendment of the existing redernl stntute which provides for the mediation conciliation nnd arbitration of such controversies ns the present by adding to it n provision that in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail u full public investigation of the merits of -every such dispute shall be Instituted nnd completed before n strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted And sixth the lodgment In the hands of the executive of the power n case of military necessity to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try ns mny be required for military asc nnd to operate them for military purposes with nuthority to draft Into tho military service of the United States such train crows nnd adminis trative dlllchils ns tho circumstances for their safe and efileient use Renews His Recommendations The second nnd third of theso rec ommendations tho congress immediate ly acted on It established the eight nour day ns the legal basis of work ind wages In train service nnd it au thorized the appointment of n com mission to observe and report upon the practical results deeming these the measures most Immediately needed but It postponed action upon the other mggestlons until nn opportunity should be offered for n more deliberate con ildeintlon of them Tho fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces mry to renew The power of the in terstate commerce commission to grant in increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regnrd to such n matter might seem to J raw In question Uie scope of the com lisslons authority or its inclination to Idp Justice when there Is no reason to doubt either The other suggestions the increase in the Interstate commerce commis sions membership and In Its facilities for performing Its manifold duties the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary In time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing Those who have intrusted s with the responsibility SS2 duty or Bcrvtng ntia nuitn them In such matters would find It hard I believe to excuse n failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of nctlon upon them Not only does the Interstate com merce commission now find It prnctl cnlly impossible with Its present mem bership nnd organization to perform its grent functions promptly nnd thor oughly but It Is not unlikely that It may presently be found ndvlsnblo to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting It must first be perfected ns nn administrative Instru ment The country cannot nnd should not deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon tin adequate scale under our present laws We should clear awtiy till legal obstacles and create n basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unreguluted license The thing must be dene now because the opportunity Is heie and may escape us if we hesitate or delay Porto Rlcoi Needs The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Illco Is brief and conclusive The present Iuws governing the Island and regulating the rights and privileges of Its people are not Just We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied There Is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a suspicious djQubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move We do not doubt what we wish to do In any essential particular We ousht to itn It nt once There nre other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which It Is not necessary that I should speak Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubtbe found nnd action taken upon them Inasmuch as this Is gentlemen prob ably tho last occnslon I shnll have to address the Sixty fourth congress I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure nnd satis faction I have co operatcd with you In the many measure nf constructive pol icy with which jou have euilched the legislative annals of the country It hns been a privilege to labor In such company I take tne liberty 01 con- consent to remain nny longer exposed gratulatlng you upon the completion of to profound industrial disturuances tor a record of rare sericeauieness nnu Inck of nddltlonil menns of distinction tlon and conciliation which the con gross can easily and promptly supply And nil will ngrce that there must be no doubt ns to tho power of the execu tive to mnke Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they nre needed nnd whenever they nre needed This Is n program of regulation pre- cntlori and administrative efficiency Bound to Make Good The well dressed stranger stepped Into the drug store nnd pnsslng by the boy who usually attended to casual customers approached the proprietor who was arranging some goods In the show case Mr C presume7 he re marked pleasantly nnd the druggist turned nnd bowed gravely I have which nrgucs Its own case In the mere j beard my friend statement of It With regard to one you often said of Its Items the Increase In the off clcncy of the Interstate commerce com mission the house of representatives has already acted its action needs only the concurrence of the fiennte For Control and Operation I would hesitate to recommend and I dare say the cungiess would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it that any mnn In nny occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave To pass a inw which forbade or prevented the Individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society In do ing so would be to adopt u new prin ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I lake It for granted we tire not prepared In Introduce Hut the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not he stopped or Inter rupted by the concerted nctlon of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle It Is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to slop the In dustrial processes of the nation at any rate before the nation shnll have had an opportunity to acquaint Itself with the merits of the case us between em ployee nnd employer time to form Its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits and opportunity to con slder nil practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration I can see nothing in thai proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the uecessary processes of its very life There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in It unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done It can and should be done with a full nnd scrupu lous regnrd for the Interests and liber lies of all concerned ns well as for the permanent interests of society itself Other Legislation Urged Three nmtters of capital importance await Hie action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives the bill which uceks to

the Corrupt Practices Act I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted Into law Their urgency lies Jn the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at tills time not only opportune but neces sary Een delay would seriously Jeopard the Interests of the country nqd of the government Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money In elec tions may mm iii to be less necessary than the Immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer be cause nt least two years will elapse before another election In which fed eral offices are to be filled but It would greatly relieve the public mind If this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation nnd the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present experience and u delay would have the further very se rious dladnntiige of postponing ac tion until another election wns at hand and some special object connected with it might bo thought to be In tho mind of thoso who urged It Action can be taken now with
