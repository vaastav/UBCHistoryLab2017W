PLACING TIIE STATUARY FINDING a proper location for the Hershey statuary has revived to some extent the discussion of the Barnard statuary at the Capitol. A Philadelphia newspaper seems to think that Harrisburg was responsible • for the controversy over the nude figures of the famous sculptor and l hat this city forced the draping of he figures. Harrisburg may have had something o do with that discussion, but it will he recalled that there was a general protest which led to changes by the sculptor after the statuary Mas in place. More important than the criticism of the nude figures was the wider and more serious criticism of the location of the statuary, it is now conceded that a serious mistake was made when these marble groups were placed at the entrance *0 the Capitol. They have always been out of harmony with the granite structure and as the years eo on the incongruity becomes more striking. It is believed that In the reconstruction of the Capitol grounds and the general revision of the land scape treatment some other place will be found for these figures. Let us hope that a similar mistake Is not made in the selection of a rest ing place for the much discussed Donato group, "The Dance of Eternal Spring." Broadening of domestic demands for dry goods, the operation of many mills at full capacity, the promotion of out door work by reason of favorable conditions, the impetus of exceptional Christmas trade, the reduction of idle ness and the optimistic attitude of the people themselves are the elements which are entering into a prosperous, active business situation throughout the country. Unless Congress persists in Its baiting of the business interests the coming year should hold much of promise for all the people. THE CUTY PARKS ' A S his term draws to a close even those who opposed his re-elec tion as a member of the City Council are beginning to realize how much was accomplished by City Com missioner Taylor in a comparatively brief period. In addition to the great improvement of the River Front he has practically completed the Park way from Cameron Extension through Paxtang to Reservoir Park. This has involved much negotiation and the work of construction has been diffi cult, owing to the outcropping of stone on the line of the Parkway. There Is still much to be done in the development of the park areas and it is expected that the budget will give Commissioner Taylor's successor suffi cient funds to carry forward the necessary work and provide for proper maintenance. Since the completion of the Front Steps at Market street considerable landscape treatment will be necessary between the Market and Walnut street bridges, especially in the reduction of the old roadway to ia proper path, and the planting of shrubbery and vines on the slope. One of the last pieces of good work in the Department of Parks this year was the making of the opening in the concrete around the two bridges for the planting of vines that will cover the unsightly abutments. It is expected also that the en gineers of the Department will give proper lines for the filling of the em bankment from Maclay street north ward so that the slope may be treated and be in shape for the construction of steps and a wall in the future. There is also much planting yet to be done and as there is abundant mate rial in the city nursery this work will go forward with the opening of , Spring. Mayor-elect Meals has made some announcements of his selections for the police department, and he has also in dicated some plans for traffic regula tion. There is not so much publtc in terest or concern in tho personnel of 'he police department as in the quality •it the service which will be rendered. ) The Mayor-elect has expressed some vane views on the general conduct of his administration and It remains for him TUESDAY EVENING, to put these suggestions into practical i operation. Meanwhile, the people will ' watch with open minds the sweeping of the new broom. MR. STAMM, PRESIDENT BY a decisive vote the school board last night elected A. Carson Stamm president for the com ing year. Mr. Stamm brings to the services of the board a trained legal mind, experience in school affairs, l a wide acquaintance with the educa tional needs of the city and a broad vision. He was elected a director on all three tickets presented for the con sideration of the voters at the last election and. without opposition. His choice as president removes the board from all suspicion of political motives in its activities. Let us hear no more of control of directors by this or that influence. Let everybody get behind the board and give it the support it must have if it is to do effective work. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THE message of President Wilson, read before Congress to-day, is not alone the longest he has pre sented during his nearly three years of office, but by far the most impor tant. It is, even to a greater extent than usual, a masterpiece of English writing. It <s clear-cut and forceful. In the main it reflects the sentiments of the nation in a general way. Be yond question, a majority of the people believe the country must be prepared to resist any such force as devastated helpless Belgium. Beyond doubt, also, the President's views with respect to Pan-Americanism coincide with those of all good Americans who have given the matter any thought. The Presi dent goes after the hyphenated Ameri can in language every word of which is like a whiplash to bare flesh, and in this again he is in full accord with popular opinion. There is balm also in the thought that the White House has concluded the railroads have suf fered quite enough and are entitled to whatsoever relief may be accorded them. But the President cannot expect either Congress or the country at large i to concur unanimously in his assertion that our course in Mexico has been justiiled and that we have been tried and "have stood the test.'* Neither will he be able to command Repub lican support for the perilous and fool hardy ship purchase bill upon which he has set his heart. He is ready to make some concessions to opponents of this measure, but it is doubtful if he will be able to get through a bill that a large majority of businessmen, through Chambers of Commerce and similar bodies all over the country, have voted a failure even before it is inaugurated. The same may be said of the Porto Rican and Philippine | bills, defeated last year and brought forth again as a part of the White House program of legislation for the session. The President adopts without a change the naval and military plans of Secretaries Daniels and Garrison, respectively, regardless of the fact that they do not coincide in many respects with the ideas of experts in the navy and army who have given years to study of the problems involved. There are evidences already that the Presi dent and his followers will be asked to change these programs in many re spects and it is very doubtful if the President's ideas will get beyond com mittee before they are amended by those who do not believe they are adequate. This is especially true with respect to the army increases and departures recommended. Another bone of contention will be the manner in which the necessary additional revenues are to be raised. The President recommends that the present so-called "war taxes"—lm posed really to make up for Demo cratic extravagances in appropriations —be continued and that they be sup plemented by laws calling for taxes on gasoline, automobiles, hank checks and fabricated iron and steel. In taxing gasoline and automobiles at the same time he would assess the same class of people twice, since the great ma jority of automobiles are driven by gasoline, and this is sure to bring forth vigorous protest, especially from the Middle West, where the "prepared ness" spirit, is not so rampant as along the two coasts and where motor-driven vehicles are becoming more and more numerous. The proposed retention of the tariff on sugar doubtless will liave wide spread support and is an argument in favor of a protective tariff wltich at one and the same time would stand as a bar to the Invasion of cheap foreign made goods and provide a very ready method of raising revenues by means far more indirect and less burdensome than by the methods proposed by the President. If a protective tariff on sugar, why not on other commodities? This question will be raised not only in Congress, but in next year's presiden tial campaign. Lowering the exemption limit of the Income tax was to be expected. In all probability It will meet with less oppo sition than any of the other revenue raisers proposed. The advocate of preparedness must expect to pay for his peace Insurance. But the most striking feature of t,he whole message is the utter absence of recommendations as to economy. Ap parently Democratic extravagance Is to bepermltted to run riot, as last ses sion. The President does not In a single instance urge that care be taken to prune expenditures. This ly the great weak point of the document. If we arc going in for a program of "preparedness" that is to cost many millions of dollars a year, it is but mete that we save along other lines wherever possible. The "pork barrel" should be conspicuous by its absence. If the President desires hla revenue raisers to receive the support of Con gress as a whole he must not permit his party members to play fast and loose with the revenues already avail able. This is a good time to put the brake down hard on needless appro priations. Altogether there is little in the mes sage that was not expected. It accords I in large measure with public opinion i along general lines, but it goes far atield when it comes down to par ticulars and in its insistence upon the adoption of measures that have been repudiated both by Congress and the people. In so far as the President reflects the thought of the masses he will be supported in Congress, both within and without his party, but where he deviates from the beliefs of the majority he may expect Congress to step in and remedy some of the defects or refuse to comply with his wishes, for the new Congress is by no j means the pliant presidential tool the old Congress was. 

FOTTTCC* LK "~P tKKC • By the Ez-Oommitteemaa While some men active in politics and some newspapermen both in the two large cities and in the interior look upon the appointment of Vare men to places in the cabinet of Ma yor-elect Smith, of Philadelphia, as the beginning; of the campaign of a Brumbaugh-Magee-Vare alliance to unhorse Senator Penrose from the State leadership there are some who look for no contest but who believe that eventually the Governor will be given the national delegates from Pennsylvania for his presidential boom and that the leadership of the senator will be conceded. Yesterday at Wash ington Senator Penrose entered upon his new term of six years. Mis term will not end until 1921 by which time the terms of the Governor the mayors of the cities of the State and of many men now in Congress and the legis lature and in city and county offices will have expired. —The Philadelphia Record and the Pittsburgh Dispatch see In the ap poin.ments the beginning of war. The Philadelphia Inquirer in a discussion of the situation said: "Among conser vative Republicans the opinion pre vailed yesterday that there will be no factional tight at the May primaries in this city. It was pointed out that the mayor-elect would have no cause to involve his administration at the outset of his official career in a politi cal light over party leadership and that he has given no intimation of any such intention." —The Philadelphia Ledger, which loses no occasion to talk fight among Republicans, intimate.s that there will be a contest. The Ledger said to day: "Vare predominance in Mayor elect Smith's cabinet yesterday re vived reports that the Vares, with the assistance of the Governor and that of the Magee-Fllnn faction in Alle gheny county and possibly even with the direct aid of Colonel Roosevelt, would wage a State-wide battle in the Spring primaries to defeat Senator Penrose's plan to control the Penn sylvania delegation to the Republi can national convention. That it was admitted, was the big phase of the situation as it was discussed by poli ticians. The other, said to be of hard ly less importance, was that the Vares, having revenged themselves for Con gressman Vare's defeat for the may oralty nomination in 1911, now would set about attempting to eliminate Senators Penrose and McNichol as po litical factors of consequence in the Philadelphia organization. In short, it was asserted Vare activities were working toward the establishment of a new State and city leadership, which would combine the Progressives—or some of them —and the other anti- Penrose elements throughout the State." —An interesting sidelight was thrown upon the situation in a new statement by William A. Magee, Pub lic Service Commissioner and former Mayor of Pittsburgh, anti-Penrose man and champion of the Governor, in the opinion of many. He said: "I am not concerned about Philadelphia politics nearly so much as I am concerned about industrial conditions in the State, and I am desirous of business getting away from the throttling interests holding it back. Regarding the Vares, I believe they are friends of Governor Brumbaugh. But, you know, the Gov ernor is more of an educator than a politician, and as I cannot see any political light on the horizon of the State at present I fall to see where the appointments have anything to do with either Mr. Penrose or the Gov ernor." —The Philadelphia Record to-day gave tills detail of an inside fight at Philadelphia, which may have a state bearing: "There was an impression that if there is to be a war of the fac tions it will start with tho reorgan ization of councils and the. naming of committees. The Vares insist that Common Councilman Joseph P. Gaff ney, of the Twenty-sixth ward, sliah succeed John P. Connelly as chairman cf the all-important finance commit tee, while McNichol has favored Charles F. Kelley. of the Seventeenth ward. As Dr. E. B. Gleason. caucus nominee for president of Common Council, will name the committee members from that chamber, and he is aligned with the McNichol faction, it is difficult to see. how Gaffney can win the chairmanship unless McNichol shall decide to 'lay down' in the belief that local peace will help the cause of Penrose." —ln the midst of all the fussing even Pittsburgh has quieted down and only the activity of the district attor i>ey in getting after election frauds seeins to disturb that usually tumul tuous center of politics. —William H. Wilson, the legisla tive floor leader of last session and the new director of safety in Phila delphia, indirectly replied to a criti cism of his appointment by the Phil adelphia Bulletin by declaring that he meant to attend to business and to keep out of politics. Wilson is re membered here as one of the most forceful men on the floor of the House and his friends here look for him to maintain an energetic adminis tration. —Mayor John R. Lafean, relin quished his office as mayor of York yesterday on a decision of City So licitor John L. Rouse that he could not continue legally in the office after the first Monday In December, which marked the expiration of his term. Superintendent P. Z. Stauffcr, of the Department of Accounts and Finance, will fill the vacancy until the term of Mayor-elect E. S. Hugentugler be gins on the first Monday of next Jan uary. The lapse of a month between the two terms is due to the recent election having been the first in York for mayor under the new Clark act. —Ex-Governor William A. Stone, of Pittsburgh, who spent yesterday here on legal business, declined to talk politics, but intimated that he was enjoying the developments. —lt Is understood that E. F. Heff ner, prominent Lock Haven business man and mentioned for public service commissioner, may have legislative aspirations in the event that ho is not appointed. —Ex-Representatives Burnett and Barner, of Cumberland, who went down last year, are said to harbor aspirations for renomination by the Democrats. —Coatesville's mayoralty contest has been continued again. —Secretary Patton has been at Washington the last few days look ing on at the organization of Con gress and if rumors are believed, tak ing a little hand in things. —The battle for the Republican national convention is already on at aSjfe&J.

FOREIGN PLOTTERS MUST GO [New York Tribune.] This policy of Interference with American interests has been based on the notion, exploited even before the war by General von Bernhardi, that the political Influence of Americans of German descent would be powerful enough to compel the American gov ernment to wink at German aggres sions. There was some excuse for this theory, since the German government's experience with an administration which had intimated both publicly and privately that it was "too proud to light," and which had let reparation for the Lusitania murders wait l'or more than seven months, undoubtedly contributed to Berlin's belief that German conspiracies here would not be inquired Into with inconvenient dili gence. But at last we hsve reached the point at which patience has ceased to appeal even to a weak-kneed and phrase-loving administration. It is announced from Washington that the State Department put oft asking for the recall of Captains Boy-lid and von Papen until It learned definitely that Germany did not intend to disavow the Lusitanla massacre. So long as the issue was in doubt Germany's sensi bilities were not to be ruffled by the expulsion of any of her propagandists in this country. But that last delicate concession was offered in vain. Boy- Ed and von Papen have to go, and FIGHTING HAY FEVER By Frederic J. Haskin FROM the councils of the Amer ican Hay Fever Association comes word that the ragweed must go. By long experiment and study, it has been determined that the two American species of ragweed are responsible for 85 per cent, of all the hay fever in the United States. Whenever you hear a sneeze you may be sure there is a ragweed just one jump away. Wherefore, the sneezers of the nation are urged to rise up and smite the ragweed with fire and scythe until it perishes off the face of the earth. Winter might seem an inappro priate time to campaign against liuy fever, but this is the one season in the year when all the members of all the hay fever associations are able to think uninterruptedly and articulate intelligently: therefore, it is meet that every hay fever victim should read this now and plan a strong campaign against his great natural enemy, the American ragweed. Makes Life Miserable Hay fever is a humorous subject only to those who are absolutely im mune. It does not kill. It seldom in capacitates, but it makes life one long, uncertain misery. Racked by terrific sneezes, blinded by unexpected tears, snuffling and inarticulate the legions of the hay fever victims of America wander over the earth, seek ing the boon of the place where the ragweed is not. their departure, it is to be hoped, pre sages many other departures. The administration has gotten no where with its policy of flabby concili ation. It could not win a disavowal of the Lusitania crime by ignoring the flagrant offences here of Germany's diplomatic representatives. It has been forced to recognize that Ger many is not to be brought to account by polite notes or by still politer blindness to the activities of Teuton plotters against our peace and safety. It is time that the administration got back on the right track. German determination must be met by Ameri can determination. It Is essential to make a thorough house-cleaning of the alien conspirators who have been operating here with so free a hand. Let them all go! When Berlin discov ers that the United States means busi ness It may begin to think seriously of making atonement for the Lusitania horror. THE STATE FROM DAi TO DW Something very new and up-to-date | In the way of accidents occurred in! Greensburg Saturday, when Miss I Remaley, aged 19 years was thrown; from her horse and dropped into a wagon pulled by a runaway team that was going tho other direction. The girl was bounced around un pleasantly among a lot of nailed boards. It was quite a coincidence, there is no doubt about that. Noisy geese saved Charles Fegley, of Mlnesite, from being robbed of his prize winning chickens and he has| been consequently forced to divide his affection between the two varieties of fowls. Bryn Mawr girls are up to the minute in sports, and have organized a "soccer" team. Many unexpected and jarring episodes have taken place since the start of the sport, but as kickers the girls are fast rounding into shape. The dancing muscles aro found to be very useful in the new game. Mrs. Charles of Beaver Kails got all tangled up in a sausage ma chine at her home yesterday and had one finger nearly ground off. Need less to say, the sausage will be cen sored before consumption takes place. "You are dead, say nothing further. You were on the list of those blown up at "Wilmington," was the statement, DECEMBER 7, 1915. Now they are confident that they have found the key to relief. One authority announces that if the cause of hay fever had been understood ten years ago, none of it would exist to day. In New Orleans the Hay Fever Prevention Association claims to have already greatly reduced the suffering of the five thousand hay fever vic tims that are estimated to live in that city. The municipal government de tailed twenty convicts to chop down all the ragweed in New Orleans. Pic tures of the plant and instructions how to destroy it were circulated throughout the city. Vacant lots were cleared of weeds. As a result, hay fever disappeared several weeks earlier this year than ever before. To realize how serious a thing hay fever is its victims one has but to read the "experience Department" in the booklet published by the Hay Fever Association •of the United States. This organization holds a con vention every year and devotes its time to the search for remedies and for spots that are immune. The dif ficulty seems to be that a place where one hay fever patient will suffer not at all, affords absolutely 110 relief to another. Pocono Pines, Pennsylvania, according to the hay fever leaflet, was long considered an immune spot, un til certain lot owners took to culti vating goldenrod. Whereupon, the insidious sneeze appeared in the city and hay fever patients departed as a single man. made in such a positive tone by one man to another in Philadelphia yes terday that it precipitated a fight. The man who aenied the accusation of deadness swore out a warrant, but nothing further was done. The mat ter was allowed to die. Movie men, representing forty cities and towns in Schuylkill and ad joining counties, met In convention at Tamaqua yesterday afternoon and af fected a permanent organization of the Exhibitors' League of Eastern Pennsylvania.

A meeting will be held next Satur day afternoon in the Bellevue-Strat ford Hotel, Philadelphia, to launch the Big Brother movement in that city. The directing idea of the move ment is to have men take a personal interest in tho individual youthful delinquent, and try wherever possible to guide him along the right road. The movement has flourished in New York since 1904. Our Daily Laugh A DODGER.

PxdvßP 1 suppose yon H " mUwf- hand have dlffer ences opinion Ebpttmg (Ehat While the attention of the farmers in Dauphin and some of Its neighbor counties is Just now concentrated oil wheat raising because of the prosper i?* w "' among the most profit able of crops next year, there are signs that the youth of the farms in Dauphin is going to give a lot of time to corn raising. This Is largely due to the zeal with which County j3chool Superintendent Shambaugh has push ed his corn contest Idea and to the hearty manner In which the teachers have backed him up. The corn con test is nothing new and it has become a matter of State interest in Ohio and in some of the more Western States, while our own State Board of Educa tion has been calling on teachers to inculcate the importance of agricul ture in the .youth of Pennsylvania. However, this county Is so widely known as a manufacturing, mining, business and governmental center county that agriculture has never been pushed to the front as the extent of the fartns in the county merit. Bind ley I-I. Dennis, the State's official booster Of agricultural education who has been making a first-hand study of the subject, says that Dauphin county is deserving of more prominence in agricultural matters than it receives. A recent governmental publication gave the number of farms in the coun ty as approximately 2900 and there are about 160 schools. Now in the county there is just as much rivalry to be found among farmer lads and lassies over the tallest stalks of corn as there used to be among us city lolks in the days when we were young and tried to see who could raise a sun flower with the highest flower In the block. Not more than two years ago :» man at Steelton made a record pro duction of corn on a two-acre lot in the lower end of Steelton and we have the example of young Mr. Rimer of near Downingtown, who won from a National Corn Club the Pennsylvanin medal and was asked by Governor Brumbaugh to tell the rest of the boy? and girls how he did it. Ex-Secretary of Agriculture N. B. Crilchiield used to say that he would go miles to judge corn when raised by farmers' bovs be cause he considered It one of the best things he could do in the way of mak ing them see that living on the farm had its attractions. Corn contest? were a pretty interesting feature of the recent county institute week in this county and from what the county superintendent is preaching wc call expect it to be something more next, year. Just what it would mean to the advancement of agricultural interests in this county of iron and steel, coal mines and railroads to have, a county corn contest with exhibits in one of the numerous halls in this city with a chance for the boys of Harrisburg, Steelton and olher towns lo compelo with the corn raisers of the Baxtons, the Hanovers and the other townships is worth while noting. • • • Tears ago. when Harrisburg had s fair, which was a real agricultural ex hibition and a place of interest for farmers for many miles around there used to be some spirited contests for the best products and the corn was one of the chief matters of interest. Ten-foot corn with thousand-grain ears used to figure in those exhibits and there were some very fancy prizes given, some of which are to be found in homes in Dauphin and Cumberland counties, where they excited as much admiration years ago as do the Hogcs town Horse and (.'attic show prizes to day. The late Col. James Young, whose farms about Mlddletown. were widely known was also muesli inter ested in corn raising and often used! to encourage a friendly rivalry among* his farmers. In fact, there is nothing that can be relied upon to start an argument quicker nowadays among 1 farmers than relative merits of grains and if tills could be taken advantage of through State encouragement, in tensive farming and local shows it. would mean much for the quickening of interest in Dauphin county agricul ture, which lias such splendid pos sibilities. On the subject of farming It may be said that this county has probably more wheat in the ground now than it has had for years. The reports made to the State Department of Agriculture Indicate a considerable increase in acreage devoted to winter wheat in most of the townships and anyone who takes an automobile ride through the farming regions within a dozen miles of the city cannot fall to be Impressed with the number of fields devoted to the greatest of the cereals. Probably a better idea can be gained of a view from the State Capitol on a clear day. On every side are to be seen patches of bright green. They are on the York hills, up on the farms near Duncannon, over the Sus quehanna in Cumberland and dottliiK the farms of Dauphin. This is going to be a big wheat winter and if the pesky Hessian fly and the white grub worm are not too voracious next year the farmers will have more money in the banks next year than they have now.
