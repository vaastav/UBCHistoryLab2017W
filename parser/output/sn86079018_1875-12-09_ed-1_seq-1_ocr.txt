That the price fixed by said act is one dol lar per cubic yard of canal and levee, when such works can be performed for twenty-five cents per yard. That the right ol the Legislature to fix the price of any work is of questionable and doubtful legality. Wherefore, yonr petitioners pray that said Act No. 30, of 1871, be repealed, and the city be left free and required to contract with the lowest bidder, for all excavations or drainage works. ____ THE 

LOUISIANA JOCKEY CLUB, GOOD PROSPECTS. i We trust we are not over confident when we predict that by Saturday next the track at the Fair Grounds will be in splendid condi tion, and the roads leading thereto from the city be in sufficiently good order to afford very pleasant driving. The cold wind and the genial sun that have by turns visited ns dur ing the last few days have accomplished won ders in the way of drying the roads and track, and unless we are treated to another wet spell between now and the opening day of the races (Saturday), we have every reason to expect a most successful meeting. The horses are all in splendid condition, and with the fine weather and good opportunity for exer cising, we have no doubt they will make some excellent records during the meeting. All arrangements looking to the pleasure and comfort of visitors have been made with excellent care and judgment, and the providing of enjoyment for our ladies has been made an especial study with the Board of Stewards, who have every reason to expect a very large attendance of the fair The gentlemen of the club have won a S of well deserved reputation for courtesy and gallantry in their efforts to cater to the pleas ures of the ladies, and will this time redouble their efforts to please. It is generally thought that this Fall Meeting will be the most successful ever held in this city, and probably in the South. In some re spects the postponements have been bene ficial, allowing more time for thorough preparation, and we predict a grand success as the result ol the efforts of the gentlemen of the club. _______— A citizen of San Francisco has an old cop per piece the size of the old copper cent on one side of which is a very determined look int? iackass, and around the margin are the words- "The Constitution as I understand over it i.

Bayly & Pond vs. Paul Fourchy. d The attendance in the Fifth District Court yesterday was quite large, owing to the in terest taken in this suit for damages. Many old merchants and insurance men were pres ent and listened attentively to the evidence as it was given to the jury. The following is the testimony: J. Henricks sworn—(To Judge Kennard) I was cashier of the Bulletin in October and November, 1874 Counsel for defense objected to the witness testifying as to entries in the books of the Bulletin. The books were called for. Wm. E. Fitzgerald sworn—I do not know Mr. Durand's handwriting. I am agent of a company with which he was once connected. An adjuster is paid from $5 to $10 a day. Don't know anything of the article. Nothing was paid by my company. Geo. Mather—(Being shown the Durand artiole)—The Board of Underwriters never paid the bill for this article. I am employed by them; keep the minutes. If anything about that bill had oeonrred I would have known it. James I. Day—Am President of Sun Mutual Insurance Company. (Judge Kennard then read a letter from Bayly A Pond to Mr. Fourchy, offering to submit their losses by fire to arbitration. The letter was dated 25th Jane, 1874. Mr. Day— I know the contents of that let ter. They were communicated to me seme time after that. I remember a meeting at the Sun Insurance office, which Mr. I. N. Marks and Mr. Levy held in connection with the ad justment of Bayly & Pond's claim. I oalled that meeting. That letter was sent by either Mr. Bayly or Mr. Pond. I had seen it before. To the best of my recolleotion it had not then been shown oar committee by Mr. Fonrchy. Tue committee was composed of Messrs. Adams, Fitzgerald, Doane,—I can't reool leot all of them. I am not sure of them. At the meeting of the Finance Committee Mr. Marks commented on the fact that— Mr. Semrnes objected. Cross-examined by Mr. Semmes—I was posted all the time about everything con nected with the fire. This committee was one composed of members of companies having an interest in the loss. The Board of Underwriters had nothing to do with it. Re-examined—My impression is that the letter was shown me abont three weeks after it was written. Re-cross-examined—,My recollection is that the committee was not disposed to take the outside opinion of merchants as to the loss Re-direct—Th9 Board of Underwriters had nothing to do with that article published, don't know his handwriting. I am a member of the board. They never paid for the pub lication of the article. Witness described how the committee of the varions companies was formed on the Bayly & Pond loss. I wrote some articles relative to defending the insnrancH companies in reply to those as sailing the Underwriters. I think Mr. Van Benthnysen admitted he wrote one against the companies, under the nom de plnme "A Young Merchant" The Durand article was after that. Oapt. L. O. Frost—I am Marins Inspector for several insurance companies. Being shown the Dnrand artiole says he does not know his handwriting. Wm. Pemberton—Am the marine and river clerk in the Merchants' Insurance Company. Being shown the article says he does not know the handwriting. Mr. Rousseau—Am runner in the Mer chants' Insurance Company. Being shown the article published 6ays he does not know the handwriting. A. Archinard—Testified to the same effect, Mr. Nott sworn—Never saw the handwnt ing in this article before. This is better than Mr. Durand's handwriting. The pencil marks look like Mr. Durand's handwriting, but the ink does not [Being shown a letter of Mr. Durand to Mr. Pond] I think this is his writing; it looks like it. Mr. Henricks recalled—Referring to the books of the Bulletin, says (page 353 of the ledger) "Charge to Board of Underwriters, headed 'Insurance Question,' $48, three times, $144." On the 16th October, another advertisement appears, headed "Reply to Bayly & Pond," $8. The cash book says, Nov. 7, '74, S. A. Dnrand is credited with $180. The collector's memorandum book says, " S. A. Durand, amount due, $200; paid in office, $180." I was in the office when this payment was made. It was by S. A. Dnrand. The original entry was made by me. I made the charge to the underwriters under Mr. Byerly's direction. The bill was paid in greenbacks. There was one $100 bill. When Mr. Durand paid the bill, Mr. Byerly told me to give him an order for a hat Crof-8-examined — Publications made by Bayly & Pond were paid for. Mr. Kennard objected to going into an examination of the books, Mr. Semmes replied, and a long argument followed, in which Messrs. New, Yoorhies, Kennard and Semmes took part. The Judge sustained the objection. Testimony resumed—There are entries in the Bulletin books referring to other pub lications made for Bayly & Pond, and errone ously charged to Mr. Van Benthnysen. In the ledger, July 4, for advertisement headed " In surance Question," $6 75; October 15, adver tisement headed "Insurance Question," $26 40, and others. This account was trans ferred to the acoount of Bayly A Pond. They made payments for this. Re-direot—I don't know the articles headed "Insurance Question." Three o'clock arriving, the court adjourned until to-day. A PnorosiTiON to the Creditors of Ala bama.— The commissioner appointed to ad just and liquidate the debt of the State of Alabama have adopted a plan, which they have submitted by circular to the creditors of the State, inviting an early response. The proposition is the issue of a new thirty years' currency bond, principal and interest paya ble in New York, as follows: For the first five years at the rate of 2 per cent per annum ; for the next succeeding five years at the rate 3 per oent per annum; for the next succeed ing ten years at the rate of 4 per cent per an num, and for the remaining ten years at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, the new bonds to be exchanged for tbe old bonds at their face, all past due coupons and such as will mature on or before the 1st of July, 1876, to be surrendered witu the bond to which they belong, without being computed as part of the amount to be exchanged for new bonds. All coupons must be surrendered. There are now in circulation $1,000,000 of State obliga tions. _ "Figuratively speaking"—Galling off elec tion returns .—Morristown Herald.

Movement to Set Aside the Seiz ure of the Municipal Money. It will be remembered that the lands of the city were seized in the hands of the Louisi ana National Bank, by process of garnishment, few days ago, in the suits of James Wadick, Jno. A. Morris, and W. S. Peterkin, and the Administrators were brought almost to a dead lock on this acoount Wednesday morning, B. F. Jonas, City At torney, John McPheiin, District Attorney, acting for the parish, and Hays and New for the Criminal Sheriff, filed in the several cases mentioned, in the United States Circuit Court, rules to set aside the seizure, and thus relieve the city's embarrassment Among other grounds set forth, they set up that the funds so seized are the publio reve nues of the city, and were deposited to the credit of the several funds, for the benefit of which they were assessed and collected in accordance with various acts of the Legisla ture, and they, therefore, are not susceptible of seizure; and, further, that these funds are imperatively required by the city, and the seizure will seriously embarrass the city gov ernment. The Criminal Sheriff alleges that certain sums were appropriated to him for the support of prisoners and keeping the parish jail, and that if the Beiznre remains he will be unable, at his own expense, to maintain prisoners. The rules were fixed for Monday, December 13tb, for trial before Judge Woods in the Circuit Court. THE 

CITY FUNDS. of ; to of Congress and the Democrats. A few days since we expressed tbe opinion that, owing to the new political revolution of the Southern States, the Democracy wore cer tain to control a permanent and reliable ma jority in Congress. The intelligent Southern correspondent of the Commercial, H. V. R , agrees with ns, and thus strongly puts tbe question. He says: It looks to me as though the Democrats will permanently hold a majority in Congress. At every election the South becomes more and more united, and the Congressional delega tions more and more solidly Democratic. Presently you will find that it will require only abont fifty Democratic Congressmen from all the Northern States to assure that party control of the House. Whatever tidal waves may sweep over the land, yon oau not expect them to effect anything in this part of the country. After awhile the Senate will be on the verge of falling into the hands of tbe Demo crats, tor at every Senatorial election in the South they will assuredly make a grin. In the last few years they have gained one in Ala bama, one in Florida, two in Georgia and one in Mississippi (to be elected in January), one in Missouri, two in North Carolina, two in Tennessee, one in Texas, two in Virginia and one in West Virginia, Many such net-hanls as this, with now and then a gain in the Northern States, will give the Senate permanently to the Demo crats. They will further gain in the South in the next three years seven Senators, as fol lows: Alabama 1, Arkansas 2, Florida 1, Lou isiana 1, Mississippi 2, Texas 1; total 7. Even should the Senatorial representation from the Northern States remain as now these gains from the South will make the Senate a tie." It is evidently pretty certain that Republi can Congresses, however it may be with Re publican Presidents, are "played ont." No more bayonet bills will be passed, and with out the bayonet the organization will sub side.— Cincinnati Enquirer..

This battle-scarred naval hero thirsts for the life blood of the Spaniard. He longs to buckle on his naval uniform and armor and go forth to become the terror of the Beas. Like Don Quixote, whose ideas became somewhat ex, sited though confused through studying too many works upon knight errantry, Robeson, by perusing too closely the history of the ex ploits of Lord Nelson, Collingwood, Paul Jones, Preble, Perry and Decatur, has been seized with a consuming thirst for glory. The laurels of Farragut will not suffer him to sleep. The distinguished navigator unites with a sanguinary nature sublime aspirations, He tosses fleets abont the ocean a3 if they were bon bons, and orders ships and monitors into commission with the nonchalance that he orders a beefsteak or glass of sherry. There is, of course, nothing to be done ex cept for the country to gaze in awe at the grandeur of the warlike deeds and prepara tions of this gory man.— Washington Tribune ; So They Go !—The point decided by the Supreme Court in the Union Pacific case is simply this: A promise to pay coupon bonds "at matnrity" is not a promise to pay the several coupons when thejVEture, bat is only a promise to pay the sum total of coupons (maturing every six months) and the princi pal of the bonds when the latter matures, and not before. Individuals will have their own opinions about the correctness of this decision, but very few wjll deny that the court might better have omitted all it says abont "the circumstances which surrounded Congress when the act was passed." It was on "a surrounding 'fcircumstauce" that this same court based its second opinion that Congress could compel a creditor to take a printed tag, or a painted clap, of his debtor in satisfac tion of a promise to pay a gold dollar. It was on " a surrounding circumstance that this court said in 186'J, that the legal tender law was not constitutional, and in 1870 that the same law was constitutional. So we go !

It' people are inclined to invest in lottery tickets, and can affjrd to do so, there is no reason why they should not exercise the or dinary precautions taken in every other kind ot business or investment. They should at least be well assured that the soheme proposed is in good faith, that its projectors are honest, impartial and financially responsible for the faithful fulfillment of its conditions. Other wise it is worse than silly—it is criminal to waste their money. That out of the many lotteries now advertised, a very small per cent come under this category, is an undoubted fact, and they alone should be patronized. First and most prominent among the latter is the Louisiana State Lottery, chartered by the Legislature over seven years ago. During its entire career, every engagement has been fulfilled, every obligation promptly met. With such sound recommendations, its in tegrity can be implicitly relied upon, and its Grand Golden Drawing advertised to come off next Christmas, with a capital prize of $100, 000 gold, can be freely and confidently in vested in.

General Sherman has been figuring np the probable cost of a tussle with the Spanish Government for the independence and ulti mate annexation of Cuba. He comes to the conclusion that such a war would be no child's play, as it would involve the breaking down of the naval blockade of Spain, and the sub jection of the coast defences of Cuba, and would necessitate the "occupation" of the island, not on paper, bat by a real and suf ficient military force. This would, in his opinion, have to be large enough to suppress all those disorders which mnst follow the sadden emancipation of 350, 000 slaves, and attend the reconstruction of a mongrel community, consisting, in addition to these slaves, of 600,000 native Caban whites, 100,000 Peninsular Spaniards, 60,000 Coolies, and 300,000 free persons of color. Taking this view of the matter, it is not at all probable that the Democratic House of Representatives will be very eager to back up the third term movement of the President. Nor is it likely that this part of tho third term programme will be popular with the bondholders of the North, who may discover in the necessity for a still further inflation of the bonded debt no additional security for their present investments in that national blessing. With their aversion to "rag money," which carried them through the last unpleasantness, the Radicals should be can tious how they involve the country in a war with even so insignificant a power as Spain, The greenback mills would not serve their purpose now, since they have depreciated and virtually repudiated that class of currency, and an inflation of gold interest bearing bonds would be of even more doubtful ex pediency than the greenback inflation, which they so much dread. The truth is, the Radi cals are just now under bonds to keep tbe peace. They mnst look for some other "im peritive " necessity for a third term.— .Sa van nah Mews.
