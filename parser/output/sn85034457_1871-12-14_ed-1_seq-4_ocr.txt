Didn't Get Much the Best of Him. A distinguished ex-Governor of Ohio, famous for story-telling, relates that on one occasion, while addressing a tem perance meeting at Georgetown, D. C, and depicting the misery caused by in dulging too frequently in the flowing bowl, his attention was attracted to the sobs "of a disconsolate and seedy-looking individual in the rear part of the room. On going to the person and interrogat ing him, he was told the usual tale of woe; among other sad incidents that during his career of vice he had buried three wives. The Governor having buried a few wives of his own sym pathized deeply with the inebriate, and consoled him as much as was in bis power. Said he: "The Lord has in deed afflicted you." The mourner sob bingly replied: "Yes, yes, He has," and. pausing a moment and wiping his nose, continued: "But I don't think the Lord got much ahead of me, for as fast as He took one way, I took another." ' lux report of the Boyal Agricultural Society on Scotch farmine eives the fol lowing particulars respecting wages of Kgnvuitunu jauorers in loan country. Harvesting is done mainly by hand, as the cost of machine work ezeeeds that of manual labor. A good hand will un dertake harvesting, including all the various operations, at Irom $1.75 to $2.25 per acre. Hands are generally hired for the whole harvest, to what ever length that season may be extend ed by unseasonable Weather. This tkv. riod generally occupies five to eight weeks, although eleven weeks have sometimes been occupied by it. The amount of wages paid is generally a supuiatea sum, ana varies irom $ia to $20, with food and beer ; lodging being of no account, the straw mow in the barn furnishing ample and satisfactory accommodations. The binding and other light operations are performed by women, who receive $14 to $15 for the whole harvest, with food. Considering the difference in the cost of the neces sary articles of living, and. the very eco nomical and abstemious habits of the Scotch laborers, the wages here men tioned are equally as remunerative to them as the more advanced rates paid to American laborers in the United States. .. .- - A London letter says that at least one-third, if not one-half of the entire population of that city is in favor of a republican form of government in Great Britain. The spread, of republican principles . has been extraordinarily rapid in England during the last two years, and is now more rapid than ever. Mr. Walter, proprietor of the Lon don Times, has stepped from his high position of independent journalist to accept a peerage . from the decaying monarchy of England.
