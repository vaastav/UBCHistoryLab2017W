In the Sixth District Court the suits of several policemen, late of the City of Jef ferson, against tbe city for services render ed, eanie up for trial before a jury. The suits are against the city, based on the clause transferring tbe liabilities of Jeffer son, with the other rights, corporal and in corporal, to thecitv of New Orleans. Suit was entered by a property owner of the Garden District furtive hundred dollars damages, based on the following state of affairs recited: That a eerrain shoemaker has erected on a lot adjoining his (plaintiff's) residence a wooden shanty, ami that the said shoe maker has declared in public that he in tended to annoy, vex and harass the neigh bors by putting said property to such uses as should make it a nuisance and plague to the neighborhood; that he would rent said property to persons, and would obtain per sons to occupy and use it so as to annoy and disturb the neighbors thereto to their heart'! content, and that, with such view in mind, said shoemaker caused 6uch premises to be used and occupied, and still causes it to be used by various persons, who almost daily and nightly as semble, aud with yells, howls, hooting and shrieks, noisy Lickings and beatings, render the neighborhood hideous, and destroy all comforts and delights of tbe neighbors; that saitl fearful orgies are continued far into the hours of the night, when all honest persons should be asleep: and, therefore, the shoemaker should he condemned to pay petitioni>r$500 for damages in the premises." In the Eighth District Court the lollow ing decisions were delivered: New Orleans, &tohile and Chattanooga railroad vs. the city of New Orleans. Charles Morgan, inter verier This action was commenced by an injunc tion to. restrain the city from selling to Charles Morgan, as owner of the franchises outlie New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western railroad, the square of ground known as No. —T, and hounded by Girod. Notre.Damo, Water and Pilie streets. The injunction has been made perpetual, and the intervention of Charles Morgan is dis missed. Pontchartrain Railroad Company vs. New Orleans, Mobile and Chattanooga* Railroad Company.—The ease relates to the right of the defendant to enter u|>on the two banquettes in Elysian Fields street. Judg ment for delendants, aud claim dismissed. State, on information of Simeon Helden, Attorney General, vs. the city of New Or leans, Charles Morgan, intervenor. This suit was brought by the Attorney General for the purpose of maintaining as against the city the grants made to the New Orleans, Mobile and Chattanooga rail road. For the reasons tiled in above suit, .judg ment is entered tor plaintiff. The interven tion of Charles Morgan is dismissed. John Ochiglevieh and William P. Healy vs. the New Orleans, Mobile and Chatta nooga Railroad Company. Petition for an injunction to restrain defendants from put ting their track on a strip of ground on the levee, and owned by defendants. The injunction lias been refused. The New Orleans, Mobile and Chatta noogo Railroad Company vs. the Pontehar train Railroad Company. Injunction made perjietual. In making the mandamus on the Gover nor, applied for by the Mississippi Valley Navigation Company, Judge Emerson makes the following conclusions: The aet recognizes the relator as a con tracting party; it authorizes a subscription its capital stock: provides the means and time of payment: directs the treasurer to pay the installments: designates a place ol deposit for the scrip, aud requires the in terest of the State in the company to he represented by three directors to be ap pointed by the Governor. All this is enact 'd without conditions and without any ;eruiB, either in the title or the act itself, to udicate the investment of discretionary lower in the agent. The intention of the act clearly was to nake the State a stockholder in the com jany, and it has virtually become a stock holder, unless the word "authorized, ' in the tjurth section, left it to the Governor's iption whether to subscribe or not. If that lad lieeu the design of the lawgiver, he Mould unquestionably have expressed it in tie title, and framed the act in accordance ritli it. The highest courts in England aid in this country have interpreted the wird "may," in many instances to mean "siall," and that interpretation is usually gi'en when a public duty is to be per totued. It is now the settled law that wlere power in permissive terms is granted to l public officer or agent, to be used for putlic benefit, or to advance individual rigits, its exercise is peremptory. ). Legislature makes laws, and through tlnir enactment it makes contracts. It is powerless to perform such acts by proxy or by procuration, but it empioys agents to exeiute them, who must necessarily be em powered to do it. In this ease the Legisla turehaving no sign-manual, and being un able itself as a body to subscribe for the stoei, found it necessary to employ an ageit to perforin that mere clerical duty. Whfii, therefore, it authorized the Governor to stbscrihe. it did nothing more than to use j for that purpose. Inthis ease the title of the aet, and the term! and principles and requirements whici follow it, can leave no doubt that it was 6e intention of the Legislature to suii scriblior the stock aosolutely.

Iu ano|ier part of this morning's Repub lican wil be found tbe programme of the races to lay, under the auspices of the Metuirie jockey Club. Everything is lovely on tbe trijk, and there is every probability that tbe iky will be magnificent. Tbe Ndr York Tribune says: "The av erage lectjre audience in New York is said to be twoior three newsboys, four police men, a de:{ old lady, a stranger who does not know wbere be is, half a dozen re porters, aii i the irrepressible citizen who goes ever; there on principle. No city in the Union fers such poor inducements as this does to lecturers who have not achieved h h distinction and wide reputa tion." Mrs. Woe hull has asked the Cleveland Herald, to pi it the following: "The day the social speed was delivered in Steinway Hall, Mrs. V >odhull spent three hours with Henry War: Beecher, who went through the speech liie by line, and he said its high moral tone wuld do honor to any pulpit."

CITY HALL. In behalf of the managers of the different places of amusement in the city, we beg leave to inquire why their petition, sent in some three or four weeks ago, protesting against the use of Lyceum Hall for a bird show, was pigeon-holed in the Mayor's parlor 1 The object and design of the Lyceum Hall was for free lectures, and the petition referred to was addressed to the Mayor and Council. It should have been presented and published in the official pro ceedings, which appear every week in this paper. The Connor Case. The jury in this case, tried in the Fourth District Court, have rendered a verdict awarding to Connor $28,000. as the value of the square fronting the waterworks, and $2000 for the rent of it, making a total of $30,000 for a piece of ground which cost the owner $13,000 only three years ago, and if we mistake not a part or the whole of this amount was paid in city notes, which were at a heavy discount. It is gratifying to know, from the evi dence of our best real estate men, members of the Citizens' Association, who testified in this ease, that the real estate m this city has advanced one hundred per cent in value during the last three years. It is probable an appeal will be taken by the owners of the property to the Supreme Court, as the award is not considered up to the paying capacity of the city. Let the committee of fifty appointed by the meeting at the Mechanics' Institute look into this matter. It makes a great differ ence whose ox is gored. While the Citizen's Association is inquir ing into the liabilities of the city, perhaps it might be well for them to know that the Supreme Court has held the city liable for the payment of certificates of indebtedness fraudulently issued. Drainage. e are now overhauling the drainage ac counts since I860, and it is astonishing to see the large amounts paid about that time for officers' salaries and maps and tableaux. Salaries were even drawn while the indivi duals were at the battle of Shiloh; but we fail to discover, in our rambles about the suburbs of the city, any visible works per formed by the late unlamented boards of drainage tax commissioners. United Stales Marine Hospital, Common Street. Mr. Mullet, the United States architect condemns this institution as being in an un fortunate location. It is for the govern ment interest, but was not for the interest of the parties who had the locating of it previous to the war, when $10,000 was given for a square of ground worth only $10,000. Some of our "best citizens," perhaps, can recollect the little transaction, and refer to t in th" meetings of the Citizens' Associa tion. We propose in our future articles to do this town for the last twenty years, and show how the "budget debt" was created. Metuirie Jockey Club Races. The fall meeting opened yesterday with very eool weather and a bad track, but this did not prevent the appearance of many well known lovers of the turt, attracted hv a brilliant programme laid out for this week. There have been some improve ments on the grounds, and the course is now quite up tir its old standard—and that is saying much. Three races were advertised. The first was a hurdle race, the entries being Temple, Virgil, Von Moltke and Blind Tom. Iletting was not brisk, but in some quarters Tom had the call, and a few remembered Von's pretty run at the fair. The four took a good start, 5 irgil leading and Tom following close, the others near. Blind Tom soon took the lead by working hard, for Virgil was ambitious. Tom gained steadily clear up to the borne stretch, when he gathered speed, aud tbe two passed under the coni together—a dead heat. A second trial proved Tom the best nag, he making the two miles, eight hurdles, iu 4:21'i. Second Race. stake for three year olds; $d00 added; second horse to re ceive $100; third to save stake. Only three horses rame to the stand—Sa liua, Sentinel and Right Way. Saliua led off, but at the half mile post the beasts were nearly bundled; they scattered a triffe and the hentinel showed the others liis tail, win ning first mile in 1:50, Selina second and Right \\ ay third. Second mile was wen by Sentinel. Time—S.-SS 1 *. The third race animated the spectators and not a few of them had favorites. Club purse $100, mile heats, for all ages. Six horses at the stand; Bob Shelton, Arizona i Niagara, John McDonald, Style and Billy Williamson, all good ones. McDonald had the lead at the half-mile post, but Style picked up before reaching the homestretch, coming in first in 1:56">, greatly to the sur prise of all. On starting the second heat Arizona led off handsomely, Style last. They did not run far apart until the half mile post was found, at which point Style gained considerably, but could not find Arizona, she having taken a fresh start, coming to the string in 1:57. On the third heat Arizona led off, keep ing in advance all the way round, winning in 2:03. The races for to day are a triffe out of the ordinary—two odd races and a post stake for all ages, two mile heats. Five entries are named for the latter. These will doubtless bring out a large number of people, and then the track will be quite dry to-day. Visitors will find the grounds much improved since the last meeting, and the accommodations are ample.
