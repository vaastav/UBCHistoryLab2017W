Massive and Interesting Document From the President Read to the Senators and Representatives Today. There is more actual raining nowi being carried on in Nye county, with regard to the extraction of pay ore," than at any time since 1906. This fact is borne out by the compilation of the bullion tax state ment for the quarter ending Sep tember 30, 1910.

RUMORED THAT T. & T. HAY LEASE THE T. & G. OFFICIALS OF SMITH ROAD AUK NOW CONFERRING AT LOS ANGELES ( - It has been currently rumored of late that the Tonopah and Tide water railroad was to secure a lease on the Tonopah and Goldfleld road, hut owine to the absence of offlc- iiiis nf both companies from this ction, a confirmation has been im )sslble. The reports have come from good authority and those who are in a position to know, state that the idea is highly plausible and possible. The T. & T., which is controlled by "Borax" Smith, is de sirous of securing a connection with the Southern Pacific at a point freleht from the east could be secured and conveyed to south em Nevada, and if a lease was to be taken on the road, it would give the line a continuous run from Sodavllle to Los Angeles. At the present time all the offic ials of the Tonopah and Tidewater road are in Los Angeles. Mr. Smith and Christian B. Zabriskie are also present and their being here on the coast at this time leads to the be lief that there Is something doing in railroad circles. is the bullion tax of the Tonopah Belmont Development company, which totaled $6,558.44, or nearly half of the entire amount. For the same quarter in the year 1909, the Belmont was operating at a loss and did not pay a cent of bullion tax. The change of conditions is commendable and speaks wonders for that property. As a comparison of the bullion tax payments the totals for the last four quarters are given. For the quarter ending June 30, 1910, $13,450.03. For the quarter Ending March 31, 1910, $7,573.13. -'For the quarter ending Decern her 31. 1909, $8,025.21. ' For the quarter ending Septem ber 30, 1909, $3,461.14.

Arbitration The year has been notable as witnessing the pacific settlement of two important international contro versies before the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration , of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous dip lomatic correspondence since the fisheries convention of 1818, has given an award which is satisfac tory to both parties. This arbitra tion is particularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently just results secured, but also because it is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4,x1898, by the United States and Great Britain, and disposes of a controversy the settlement of which has resisted every tther re source of diplomacy, and which for nearly ninety years has been the couse of friction between two coun tries whose common interest lies in maintaining the most ' friendly and cordial relations with each other. , The United States was ably repre sented before the tribunal, and I should be wanting In proper recog nition of a great patriotic service if I did not refer to the lucid his torical analysis of, the facts and the signal ability and force of argument six days in length presented to the court in support of our case by Mr. Elihu Root. The tribunal constituted at The Hague by "the governments of the United States and Venezuela has completed its deliberations and ha9 rendered an award in the case of the Orinoco Steamship ' company against Venezuela. The award may be regarded as satisfactory since it has, pursuant to the contentions of the United States, recognized a number of important principles making for a judicial attitude in the determining of international disputes. In view of grave doubts which had been raised as to the constitu tionality of The Hague convention for the establishment of an inter national prize court, now before the senate for ratification, because of that provision of the convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, this government proposed in an identic circular note addressed CONGRESS GIVES ATTENTION TO PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE FOUR JURORS PASSED IN TRIAL OF DR.

As the result of an lnfor mal discussion, it was decided to provide such procedure by means of a separate protocol which should be ratified at the Bame time as the prize court convention itself Accordingly, the government of The Netherlands, at the request of this government, nronosed under date of May 24, 1910, to the powers signatory to The Hague convention the negotiation of a supplementary protocol embodying stipulations pro- viding fot this alternative proced ure. It is gratifying to observe that this additional protocoMs being signed without objection, by the powers signatory to the original convention, and that there Is every reason to heliovo that the Inter national prize court will be soon established. The identic circular note also -pro posed that the international prize court when established should be endowed with the functions of an arbital cqurt of justice under and pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the last Hague confer ence. The replies received from the various powers to this proposal inspire the hope that this also may be accomplished within .the- reason ably near future. It Is believed that the establish ment of these two tribunals will go a long way toward securing the ar bitration of many questions which have heretofore threatened and, at times, destroyed the peace of nations.

I have not as yet made appoint- mviit to this commission . because have invited and am awaiting the expression of foreign governments as to thoir willingness to co-operate with us in the appointment of sim liar commissions or representatives who would meet with our commls sioners and by joint action seek to make their work effective. .

The convention concluded Janu ary 11, 1909, betwen the United States and Great Britain providing for the settlement of internatalonal differences between the United States and Canada including the ap portionment between the two coun tries of certain of the boundary wa ters and the appointment of com missioners to adjust . certain other questions has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed.
