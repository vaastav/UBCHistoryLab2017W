THE FLORENCE TRIBUNE " By CHAS. D. REPPY. ONLY PAPER IN PIMAL COUNTY. FLORENCE. ARIZONA. DECEMBER 9, 18CU. TERMS: OneYear SS.UO Six Months 1.50 Single Copies Five Cents Entered at the Florence postoflice as second cluss mattef. The Prescott Prospect denounces the reported platinum discoveries in Cataract canyon as a fake pure and 'simple. The Phoenix Herald, speaking of the carnival fake, says "every window was a human sardeen." The Tribune is of the opinion that Phoenix haB taken its last shy ut the "hnman sardeens." The Tbibcse warned the people against the Phoenix carnival fake, to they needn't blame us if the few who attended from this county were taken in. It will take that city five years to get over the disgrace of the hoggish ness aud grab-all propensities dis played on that occasion. Mr. Alex. Hill's report on the Ray nines, which is printed in full on the first page of this issue, makes interesting reading. The report was submitted to the directors of the com pany a meeting- held in London, Octo ber 3d, u. full account of which is given in the London Mining World of October 9th. . Congress assembled last Monday, but little business has been trans acted this week. The President in his message referred to the question of irrigation, which, he said, "was a sub ject of vital importance, ana steps should be taken to reclaim the arid lands." This is probably the first time the matter was ever referred to in a message to Congress. TllETniBUSEhad been led to suppose that a majority of the voters of Pinal preferred a man to represent them in the Legislature who bad no interest whatever in the count? and who has ' never been back since the Legislature adjourned ; but it seems that was not 'the case, and at last the truth has - come out that Doc. Wright was elect ed because his opponent unwittingly 'overlooked to Dole the fact in his 'newspaper that a certain estimable young lady had received the appoint ment of teacher of a country school. Women aud whiskey are the ruination of this world. It is said the traction engine which was to accomplish wonders in hanling freight from Eed Rock to the Ray mine has proven a Tail are. It seems like folly to monkey with such devices when all past experience goes to show that the only way to make a success of big low-grade mines is to have cheap railroad transportation. They tried a traction engine at Bisbee, but abandoned it after making a trip or two, and -at last the company built Its own railrond, which has paid for itself over and over again. The Bisbee mines are now paying immense divi dends, and in our humble opinion they are no better than these on Mineral Creek. The San Francisco Argonaut, one of the uncompromising republican jour nals of the Pacific coast, in referring ;to the danger of the downfall of the republican party, says : "The vote is rising up against the republi can party. The trades unions are declaring against expansion. Workingmen fear an nexation, with its menace to free labor and its menace of free trade. The latest body to declare itself in this direction is the Knights of Labor, the most numerous and most powerful labor organization in the country. At the close of their convention in Boston November 23, they unanimously passed res olutions condemning the administration's foreign policy, strongly opposing Philippine annexation, denouncing President McKinley 'us the bitter enemy of labor,' and 'asking organized labor to use its votes against him and his associates.' Docs any sane repuhli can believe that we can carry this country in 100 with united labor ranged against us if so, we do not. Is the death of Judge A. H. Hackney, which occurred last Sunday, Arizona loses one of its best citizens. He was boru in Mercer, Pa., in 1815, re sided in St. Louis twenty-five years and on the frontier in New Mexico and Arizona since 1857. Judge Hackney came to Globe from Silver City, N. M., shortly after the first mineral dis coveries, and in 1878 established the Silver Belt. It is with sorrow the Tribune records the death of this scholarly old gentleman, who, in ability, wbb without a peer in the pro fession of journalism in our territory. His was that sturdily honest nature that made warm friends and desirable enemies, and if we were permitted to write hi epitaph it would be : A good man has gone And the world is the worse for it.

PROSPEROUS PINAL. An Extraordinary Activity in Mining Mat ters. From the Phoenix Republican.) Steve Bailey of Florence is in the city. The capital of Pinal, Mr. Bail ey says, is in better shape than it ever was before. This new prosperity is largely due to the activity in the Min eral Creek district. Beside the old mines, which are being worked, pros pectors are constantly looking for new oues and are finding many of them. There is no where else in Arizona so much activity throughout on entire district as thero is in Mineral Creek. The improvements being made are of an expensive and permanent charac ter. A great deal of costly and up-to-date machinery is being put in; an automobile route from the Ray mine to Bed Rock, on the Southern Pacific, has just been completed, and plans are maturing for several short railways. The faith in the district is proved by the money being invested. Several properties have lately changed hands and Joseph Mulhatton has cleaned up something like $3,000 within the last month in commissions. Mr. Mulhatton is conuected with a mining exchange, which The Republican lately gave a free and extended advertisement. The news of Mr. Mulhatton's activity in mining matters explains why the late display of Leonids did not come up to popular expectations. When Mr. Mul hatton is not otherwise engaged, he makes a specialty of Leonids and other aerolites and meteors. He lias elec trified the world by his discovery of more numerous and thrilling meteors than most astronomers see in a life time. Mr. Mulbatton's discoveries have always been made in times of profound celestial peace, so it is inter esting to contemplate what he could haveseeuina regular meteor season if he had not been so busy at some thing else. That is why nothing was heard from Florence amid the late gen eral excitement. The territorial and United Stales district conrts are now in session at Florence. Six of the federal prisoners under indictment have pleaded guilty and there are a great many more to be tried. Among them are a dozen colored soldiers charged with a murde rous assault on a camp of peaceful Apaches at San Carlos. Mr. Bailey says that not fewer than 300 residents of Graham and Gila counties are now at Florence attending federal eourt, and nearly all of them are intending to visit" Phoenix during carnival week. A 

GOOD JOB. Luis Chavez Shot and Killed by Sheriff Wakefield. 1 From the Tucson Citizen. Luis Chavez,' one of the most fiendish criminals that Arizona ever knew, was shot and killed by Sheriff. Wakefield last Saturday night. Chavez was a member of the quartette of despera does that recently escaped from the Pima county jail. Last Friday morn ing a Mexican boy came to the local jail and told Mr. Wakefield that Chavez had eaten breakfast at Tanque Verde the day before. Mr. Wakefield paid the lad a liberal reward and im mediately went to Tanque Verde. He struck the trail of the fugitive at that place and followed him across to the Rincon mountains. Mr. Wakefield learned upon reliable authority that Chavez was going to Greaterville, so he dropped the trail, went toVail's; and from there took the train to Critten den. At Crittenden he secured a horse and saddle and rode to Greaterville. The sheriff learned that Chavez had teen seen that day in the brush near Greaterville. A Mexiean put him upon the trail of the outlaw and Mr. Wakefield followed the trail with all possible speed. Just at sun down Saturday night, when about five miles east of Greaterville, the sheriff caught sight of Chavez about sixty yards ahead of him. He at once yelled out for Chavez to throw up his luindp, j but tha desperado, instead of obeying the summons, reached for b.isrevoiver and the sheriff fired upon him with a big double barrelled shot gun. A large portion of the eharge entered the chest of. the outlaw, killing him in stantly. A coroner's inquest wan held the next day and Chavez was buried under a tree near where he wasshot. Sheriff Wakefield then retuned arriving last night. to Tucson, The career of crime which Sheriff Wakefield cut short Saturday evening has been most hideous. Several years ago Chavez murdered his wife, and a short time later he killed a fellow miuer with a shovel. Both of these crimes were committed in Sonora. Chavez then Jed to Arizona. Less than two years ago he murdered a Chinaman at Rollin. Once more he escaped the gallows and secured em ployment as a railroad section hand at Crittenden, but had bjen at work only a few weeks when he murdered his foreman, a man' by the name of Shep ard. He was brought to the local jail to wait trial and all readers of Hie Citizen are familiar with the details of his escape. Chavez is known to have committed the four murders enu merated, and he is strongly suspected of several others. l'he revoiver Chavez had upon him at the lime of his death belonged to Mr. H opley and was htolen from the jail office at the time be escaped.

It has been suggested that a con struction of the North and South road from Phoenix to Florence, thence to Riverside near the Ray mine, theuce up the river to Mammoth and through to Tucson would be a most profitable route for traffic. And this is liable to be the route of the extension of this line. (Tucson Star. PEARS! PEARS!!

It is, then, of the most vital importance that you should exercise the greatest possible caution in selecting the seed you are to plant the coming season. Since you cannot deturmine their fertility or freshness by sight, the only certain way to insure yourself against worth less seeds is to buy only those that i - bear the name of a firm about whose reliability there is no question. There are no better known seedsmen any where, and none who have a higher reputation for integrity, than D. M. Ferry & Co., of Detroit, Mich. Ferry's Seeds have been a synonym for good seeds for many years. Thousands of gardeners who continue to plant them season after season, do so with the full confidence that they will uniformly be found to be of high vitality, and most important of all, true to name. Ferry's Seed Annual for 1900 is fully up to the standard of former years and will be welcomed by all who have learned to regard it as a thoroughly reliable and practical guide to plant ing.

The first indication of croup is hoarseness, and iu a child subject to that disease it may be taken as a sure sign of the approach of an attack. Following this hoarseness is a peculiar rough cough. If Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is given as isoon as the child becomes hoarse, or even after the cronpy cough appears, it will prevent the attack. It is used iu many thou sands of homes in this broad land and never disappoints the anxious mothers. We have yet to learn o asinglo in stance in which it has not proved effectual. No other preparation can show such a record twenty-five 3'ears' constant use without a failure. For sale by Brockway's Pharmacy. Sheriffs Sale.
