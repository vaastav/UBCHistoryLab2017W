Scraps and Jarts. ? Washington. December 7: President Taft Is putting in all his spare time these days struggling with the question of "what is whisky?" By succeeding appeals the question has been carried through the food and drink experts of the department of agriculture, charged with the administration of the pure food and drug act, to the solicitor general of the United States and to the president himself. The printed evidence and the briefs of the attorneys who have appeared In the controversy, form a record equal to that of many of the cases which the supreme court of the United States Is called u*x>n to determine. and the president is living again the life of a Federal judge when he takes to his private library In the evening the volumes of testimony and argument which he peruses In the hope of reaching soon a strictly legal decision on the mooted question. The whole controversy hinges on the question of whether whisky, artificially aged and highly rectified, is whisky or "imitation whisky" when compared with whisky wnlch is aged and colored by the oldfasnioned method of storage in white oak barrels which have been fire-charred on the inside. ? New York, December 8: The report of the census bureau showing only 8,878,277 bales of cotton ginned to December 1, compared with 11,008,661 to the same date last season, was followed by increased activity and considerable excitement in the cotton market this morning with May contracts selling up to 15.39 or 17 points above the closing figures of last night, and at a new high record for the season. Heavy realizing, attributed to some of the leading bulls, caused slight recessions during the morning, but there was a great volume of outside buying and the market showed a very firm tone with bulls claiming that the census figures indicated a government estimate of under 10,250,000 bales. The cotton crop last year was in the neighborhood of 13.800,000 bales. The market became even" more active later in the day, with buying orders reaching the ring from all directions, while it looked as though some of the largest of the old bulls were replacing cotton which they had sold below 15 cents in expectation of 16 cents before Christmas. May contracts sold at 15.50, or $1.40 per bale above the closing bid of last night, while August advanced to 14.95, or $2.40 a bale. The close was steady with the general market showing a gain for the day of from 14 to 43 points. ? Washington, December 8: There were 8,878,277 running bales of cotton ginned from the growth of 1909 to December 1, as compared with 11,008,861 for 1908, according to a bulletin of the census bureau issued today. These figures count round as half bales, and exclude linters. They stand against 8,343,396 for 1907, and 10,027,868 for 1906. The proportion of the last three crops ginned to December 1 is 84.1 per cent for 1908, 75.5 per cent for 1907, and 77.2 for 1906. Round bales included this year are 133,919 against 201,480 included for 1908. and 154,636 for 1907. Sea Island bales Included are 77,776 for 1909; 68,396, for 1908, and 55,299 for 1907. The distribution of Sea Island cotton by states for 1909 is: Florida 25,906, Georgia 43,118, and South Carolina 8,752. The total cotton crop report for 1908 was 13,086,005, and for 1907 is 11,057,822. The corrected statistics of the quantity of cotton ginned this season to November 14, are 8,112,119 bales. By states, the cotton ginned from the 1909 growth to December 1, follows: Alabama 919,575, Arkansas 613,871, Florida 55,958, Georgia 1,677,232, Louisiana 237,553, Mississippi 866,950, North Carolina 536,163, Oklahoma 504,826, South Carolina 988,340. Tennessee 206,357, Texas 2,212,319, all other states 49,133. ? New York, December 8: George Preston Sheldon, deposed president of the Phoenix (Fire) Insurance company of Brooklyn, lying at death's door at his Greenwich, Conn., home, was indicted for larceny in the first degree by the grand jury in New York today for alleged misappropriation of funds of the company, of which he was the head for twenty-two years. As Sheldon was not arrested and probably will not be unless his health improves radically, the text of the indictment was not made public, but an official of the district attorney's office is authority for the statement that the amount which he is accused of stealing is 345,000. According to this official, Sheldon, it was testified before the grand jury, usea me iunus or creuu 01 me wisuiance company in stock market transactions through a New York brokerage firm and pocketed the profits. The grand Jury will now investigate the connection of others with alleged speculation with funds of the company. Only charges against Sheldon have been examined yet, although the report of the insurance department implicates others. In the meantime detectives will be sent to Greenwich to inquire into the condition of the accused man's health. If they are satisfied that he is too ill for trial, no attempt at extradition will be made, but he will be kept under close surveillance. His condition tonight, as reported from Greenwich, was critical. Four exhibits of interest which have figured in the grand Jury investigation so far, are three drafts for $10,000 each and one of $15,000, alleged profits of speculation which Sheldon is accused of having carried on. Each of these drafts is made the subject of a count in the indictment. Sheldon is 64 years old and widely known in insurance circles. He was taken ill with ptomaine poisoning six weeks ago, before he was deposed as president or me insurance company. ? What the Washington Times prints concerning the president is generally considered to be authoritative. This concerning the president's attitude toward the appointment of negroes to office is from that paper: "That President Taft is going to make apnolntments of northern negroes to office rather than southern ones is the information which has been pretty thoroughly disseminated among the colored politicians of Washington and elsewhere. The president has talked over his ideas about the appointment of colored men to office with some of the leading men of the race and he has signified to them his inclination to give recognition to the negro voters in northern states, where there are large populations of blacks. As the result of this policy it is expected that the negroes in the south who are holding im portant offices will, as their terms expire. be displaced for the most part by whites and in turn recognition will be given to colored men In the north. In the entire south are not many offices held by colored men?that Is. offices of importance and influence. The list of colored men holding imp< rtant offices in the south under the Federal government includes the following: Robert Smalls, collector of customs at Beaufort, S. C.: Henry Rucker, collector of internal revenue, at Atlanta, Ga.; Joseph Lee, collector of internal revenue at Jacksonville, Fla.: Nathan H. Alexander, register of the land office at Montgomery, Ala.; Thomas V. McAllister. receiver of -^ublic moneys at Jackson, Miss.; Walter L. Cohen, register of the land office at New Orleans; Alexander B. Kennedy, receiver of public moneys at New Orleans; John E. Bush receiver of public moneys at Little Lock. The course the president will take in the matter of appointing colored men is likely to be illustrated in the selection of a successor to W, T. Vernon, register of the treasury. Booker T. Washington and other colored leaders have given their support to J. C. Nanier of Nashville for the place. But it apoears the president will probably select a colored man from the north." $ht \lorkvillr (Bnquirrr. EIntertd at the Postofflce In Yorkvllle as Mall Matter of the Second Class. 

YORK VILLE, S. C.t FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1909. British statesmen continue to Insist that the government must develop cotton production In Africa by means of subsidies, and they are going to keep on along that line until they accomplish something. President Taft does not mince matters In recommending the passage of a ship-subsidy bill: but as to whether the Republican congress will dare lei such a measure go through, is very doubtful. The New York Times of yesterday, printed affidavits from George H. Dunde, an insurance broker and Capt. Loose, a retired navigator, stating that Dr. Cook had employed them to help manufacture records of his polar trip, and they are giving the things away, because the doctor failed to pay. By way of corroborating their statements, they give some of the alleged faked records. Dr. Torp, rector of the University of Copenhagen, who now has Cook's records in his possession, says that the Times story is based on fiction: that it would be impossible to fake records that will stand the tests to which these will be subjected, and it ought not to be forgotten that the Times has quite a reputation as a finder of mares' nests. Some of the papers are printing stories to the effect that Germany and Japan are mixing in the Nicaraguan affair on the side of President Zelaya, in the hope of getting a concession for the digging of an isthmian canal through Nicaragua to compete with the Panama canal. Of course we do not know; but we do not believe there is anything to the story. While it is probable that the late Senator Morgan was right in claiming that the Nicaragua route was the best and the cheapest, and while it is possible that the United States may some day dig a ditch through Nicaragua, because of physical difficulties along the Panama route, and more especially because some day the Panama canal may be found to be Inadequate to the developments of the future, we do not believe that Germany, Japan or i q nvhnHv pIso k oniric tr> trv to interfere with the operations of this country on the isthmus. Referring in its last issue to what The Enquirer has been saying about the letting of the contract for publishing the county supervisor's quarterly ' statement, the Rock Hill Herald says that our statements are prompted by malice and spite, and characterizes some of these statements, especially ' those referring to circulation and facilities to do the work as false. If anything we have said has been prompted by malice, spite, or even ordinary resentment against the Herald, 1 or any one else, we are not aware of the fact. We certainly do not feel that 1 way, and we have not said anything ! that we did not have good reason to 1 beLeve was true. Our estimate as to ! the circulation of the Herald is based I on the statement in N. W. Ayer's ' newspaper directory for 1909. The ' publishers of this book Rive the figures 1 at 1,100, and they say that they got ' their information from the Herald. Of 1 course, we understand that the figures were for the year previous. As to what the present circulation of the Herald is, we do not know, and because of the different points of view as to what constitutes circulation, we can think of but one way by which this proposition can be satisfactorily established, and that is by inviting a postal inspector to go over the list, strike off all names that are not recognized as bona fide under the rules of the postofflce department and make an official statement as to the net result. We stand ready for this test at any time. However. we insist and repeat that we have no quarrel with the Herald and no resentment toward it on account of this little advertising contract. The commissioners are not required to let the contract by competitive bidding, and we have absolutely no objection to their giving it to the Herald or any other paper. without consulting us at all. But really we do not think it exactly fair to the public to allow the impression to go out that the award was made on a F(trict business basis, unless this is a fact. Letters to aanta. > We are printing quite a bunch of j letters to Santa Claus in this issue, and s while there may be some crusty people, ? who think it is all foolishness, we don't i see it that way. The little chaps are generally quite < modest in their requests, which are generally so simple that they are hardly worth while; but as to the worth while part, we older ones have only to think a little. What grown man or woman is there who does not remember how his or her childish heart used to yearn at Christmas times for just such things as the children are writing Santa about, and , how pleased they were when old Santa . came along and left them what they | wanted. t Of course, most of the little writers ' are going to get what they are asking for. They would have probably gotten ' it had they not written: but still their * letters are not amiss for they contain suggestions that may cause Santa Claus to do a great many nice things that he would not have otherwise thought about. Christmas is not here yet. It is still fifteen days off, but it is near enough to make it worth while for all of us to begin to consider how much pleasure there is for ourselves in trying to make it pleasant for others, and if we ponder thi-3 question sufficiently, there will really be more in the wonderful season for the older people than there is for the younger ones. The Postal Doficit. Discussing the affairs of the postoffice department in his annual message. President Taft has this to say: The deficit every year in the postofflce department is largely caused by tne low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second-class mall matter, which includes not only newspapers but magazines and miscellaneous periodicals. The actual loss growing out of the transmission of this secondclass mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about J63.000.000 a year. The average cost of the transportation of this matter is more than 9 cents a pound. It appears that the average distance over which newspapers are delivered to their customers is 291 miles, while the average haul of magazines is 1,049, and of miscellaneous periodicals, 1,128 miies. Thus, the average haul of the magazine is three and one-half times and that of the miscellaneous periodicals nearly four times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet all of them pay the same postage rate of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of 1907 show that second-class mail matter constituted ?3.91 per cent of the weight of all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent of the revenue. The figures given are startling, and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the newspapers, magazines and periodicals, and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit In the postofflce department caused by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and the compensation exacted therefor. A great saving might be made, amounting to much more than half of the loss; by imposing upon magazines and periodicals a higher rate of postage. They are much heavier than newspapers, and contain much higher proportion of advertising to reading matter, and the average distance of tjheir transportation is three and a half times as great. The total deficit for the last fiscal year in the postofflce department amounted to $17,500,000. The branches of its business which it did at a loss wert? the second-class mail service, in which the loss as already said was $63,000,000, and the free rural delivery in which the loss was $28,000,000. These losses were in part offset by the profits of the* letter postage and other sources cf income. It would seem wise to reduce the loss upon second-class mail matter, at least to the extent of preventing a deficit in the total operations of the postoffice. I commend the whole subject to congress, not unmindful of the spread of intelligence which a low charge for carrying newspapers and periodicals arsist. I very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which constitutes so large a subsidy and requires additional taxation to meet It. There is very little objection to be urged to the common sense and logic of the foregoing; but if congress should carry the president's suggestions 10 their legitimate conclusions, the result would be of very great moment to the business of the newspaper publishers of the country. Under the law now, newspapers are supposed to be carried free of postage in the counties in which they are pub lished and to go from the office of publication to subscribers throughout the country at the rate of one cent a pound. The object of free postage was to encourage the spread of information, and that it has had this effect there is no question; but the laws of free competition have very naturally and properly given all the advantage of free postage to the buyers of newspapers, leaving the publishers little or no direct benefit. This concession of free postage and reduction rate of 1 cent a pound is commonly called a subsidy; but the practical result to the publisher does not bear out this designation. His profit is no greater than if his postage acC( unt had all along been on a strict basis of value received. Of course, we would not undertake to dispute the figures of the president to the effect that the cost of carrying second-class matter is 9 cents a pound; but it is nevertheless a fact that there are Hundreds or Dig dailies mat send tons of papers by express that could have gone by mall at only 1 cent a pound, and they would not do this unless there is In it. either better service or more economy. But whether the newspapers derive any benefit from the so-called subsidy or not, there Is no question of the fact that an increase in the rate on second-class postage from 1 cent a pound to 8 cents a pound, will bring about a very material shake up and readjustment in the present methods of the newspapers, and there will be an appreciable increase in subscription rates, all along the line. The Car Line Project.?Messrs. W. 3. Lee, vice president and chief engi leer of the Southern Power company, md ex-Judge F. I.

Franchise was granted this company several months ago when the plans of an nterurban street car system were in m embryonic state in the minds of he promoters of the Southern Power company, and the determination seems o be to follow out the terms of the contract upon which a franchise was secured for Gastonia, stipulating that he work must begin before Jan. 1. This project is only a part of the treat scheme which is in the minds )f the Duke interests to build a great nterurban car line in the south, conlecting the principal towns and cities of the Carolinas.
