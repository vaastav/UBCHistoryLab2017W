WEDXESDAT. DECEMBER 8, 1920. Mr. WUion'8 Coo J Message. b *1- IA..1 IT- ?????? rv... ! V ? O tutroougc; IU press Is worthy of careful reading by | c till Americans. It is not long; It Is, t in view of the recent national vote, in * excellent taste and it Is filled with r simple, practical common sense. In ? performing the duty laid upon him by v the Constitution to present to Con- * gress an annual report on the state of s the nation it was not unnatural for r him, under all the circumstances of * the past, to begin it as If he were discussing the state of the universe. Al- , most immediately, however, with one of his felicitous literary turns about helping those abroad by ourselves setting a good example at home, he 1 centred upon our domestic affairs and J thereafter stuck for the most part to ' the text. 1 It fi sound American business and It !s good international politics to set i our own house in order and keep It In \ __ order, as he urges, so that while we thus grow better and stronger, the rest of the world may profit by emulation of our welfare and happiness. The preservation ef American power, the salvation of American Institutions. depend upon our making and enforcing laws which, as Mr. Wilson says, "seoure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard 1 the Integrity of property and partial-; larly of that property which is devoted to the development of industry and the Increase of the necessury wealth of the world." And the day of redemption for those Powers and peoples of Europe now struggling against anarchy and chaos can come only out of the practice of those same principles, fundamental everywhere on the face of the earth. Nobody could more simply and cienriy state doui trie aavantage ana the necessity of our Government man- c aging Its business as carefully, effl- * dohtly and successfully as private un- 1 dertakings are managed than Mr. i Wii.son states them In his retnnrka, ' on a budget system and above all a ' working out of revenue and expendl- 1 tures under that system so that there 1 shall be neither undue strain ujion 1 onr Income nor unreasonable taxa- 1 tlon. It Is an Imperative need that : we should nmv put our Government 1 on a business basis and Mr. Wilson 1 say* that for us thus to "prove the ! Indestructible recuperative force of a 1 great Government of the people" will 1 ye nn Inspiration and guide for others. 1 This Is a good message to Congress, ' lutd the American people whom Con-1 1 gress represents. It Is n good word to j ' the world, watching this nation as the J old Administration passes and the new 1 approaches. 11 Was Loneliness the Cause of Empty 1 Farm nouses? I, In his annual report for the De- i 1 partment of the Interior Secretary i Payne bewails the decrease In the 1 farm population. He cites ns an ex- I ample Ohio, where the number of vn- 1 cant farm bouses Increased, In the i year ended June 30, 1020. from 18,000 j I to 29,000, and where the number ofil wen and boys on farms decreased A' ' Iter cent The Secretary offers only < < one reason for the swing from rural tn>< urban life: "The difficulty 1* that people do not like to live alone, but prefer to ' live in town* and vil.agea and to en- ' Joy society and the convenience* and comfort* of modern life which are beyond the reach of a scattered popu- ' lation living on large farm*." I If that excuse had been given j twenty or thirty yeara ago It woulil i have had more behind It than It can; have to-day. In the lnat decade moat of the convenience* and comforts of modern life hnve been put at the farmers' disposal. Every well to do fanner, wherever he may be, can have modern water supply, central heating, and hi* own enslly operated electric lighting plant. The motor car tal lilrn and hi* wife uulckly to market!*, shops snd tboarres and carries his children to a good school. The talking machine and the mechanical piano bring plenty of music Into his home. Never has farm life been less lonely than It has l?een In the ten years which have seen the march from the nUntigh to the city shop. And the real i reason for the movement trns not loneliness. It was the discovery by 1 the farmer's son that he could get I more money for less work in the city, r The war made this doubly possible -Vow, for the first time In five years. It looks as If the desertion of the farms would slow down. Portrait of a Gentleman. Mr. Habdtng's visit to his friends In the Senate, -fellow members Republican and fellow members Democratic, made one of the pleasantest Incidents that It was ever the fortune 3f a dally newspaper to record. Historically It was unique, for no Sen- 1 itor has ever left that chamber to go 6 m his way to occupy the White House. 1 Sentimentally and psychologically, It * ndlcates things for which every c American should be glad. In this hearty, human attitude of I he new Executive toward that Legls-' ^ utlve Department which he knowa so veil by actual participation nnd not nerely by constitutional theory, and t vhich knows him affectionately for h vhat he Is as well as respectfully for r vhat he says and thinks, are the u-omlse and presage of a blessed re- t urn to the orderly workings of cn- t rdinate government; the end of aloof- li iess and strife, the resumption of n nutual confidence and cooperation. li Senator Harding's little speech to v lis fellow Senators from the Vice- 11 'resident's desk is a model of good o aste, good will and understanding of tl he fine art of saying what ought to s' i* said under the circumstances and a lothing less or more. For nil time to n ome it will glow like a ruby Inset In s he gray pages of the Congressional fccord. In Conception and In ex- s iresslon It affords a true portrait of n modest, sincere jpptleman standing v vlthout pose or affectation at the li nresnoia 01 a new career ui iuau u itatesmanshlp, neither Intimidated v ior overbold, and asking the patriotic n lelp of all. ?. p r rite President's Individual Capacity * as Armenian Mediator. ^ "A Student of History," whose let- ti er appeured on this page yesterday, o refers to an editorial remark of The v S*ew Tobk Herald to the effect that c n undertaking the job of mediation n the case of Armenia President Wil- b ion made It clear thnt be promised b >nly personal and Individual service c iml was not assuming to act In any f tense as the representative of tnited f States policy. "IIow," asks our cor- R espondent, "can the President act in ? lis personal capacity In any case? If f he President acts he acts as Presl- b lent of the United States and morally n ilnds us as a nation and Indirectly n ifgs us Into the League of Nations." g Mr. Wilson's functions with regard 9 ;o Armenia are not the less Indlvldml and personal because be Is Presi- t lent of the United States when he ac:epts the Invitation, or because the a nvltntlon to him was suggested by tl the fact that he holds the office of President. His own letter of accept- | j ince Is the evidence of his correct ahderstanding of the personal and ndlviduul character of the undertnk- * ng. This Government Is not a mem- 0 >er of the League, and Mr. Wilson 0 lotlfles all concerned that he Is with- " >ut authority to do more than to ex- 0 rt Individual and personal efforts In lebnlf of Armenia. n The only manner now apparent In ? ivhlch Mr. Wilson as mediator could 1 ommlt the United States Govern-;0 ment, practically or morally, to a 1 future course of action with regard , r to Intervention In Asia Minor would! v je by the exercise of his constltu-10 tlonal power to recognize Armenia's c sovereign Independence by officially receiving a diplomatic representative * from the new State and by appointing r in Ambassador or a Minister to rep- " resent this Government there. But " this power exists Just the same |n ivhether the President Is mediator or ' lot; and whether he Is mediator or * lot the checks on that power exist r lust the same In the requirement of * lie Senate's advice and consent and f n the power of the Congress to withmid appropriations for the maintenance of diplomatic relations. There Is another circumstance which may serve to enlighten as as to Mr. Wilsom's own conception of the Insk he has voluntarily undertaken, r^ess than three months remain of his, term as President. It Is scarcely within the range of the possible thn'1 he complicated nnd difficult task ho Is now attempting cnn be completed before he leaves the White House, j The alternative, therefore. Is between' sensing to be mediator when he: oases to he President and finishing the work as a person without official stntus. Just as It might be done by, riolonel Howe, for example, or any other competent private citizen and friend of world pence. The very fact that Mr. Wilson accepted the Invitation at a time when the sands of his official career had s<> nearly run out Indicates a full recognition on his part of the per onnl nnd Individual character of the mediation. For nobody known better tbnn he does that his pernoiinl work for Armenia cannot be devolved, willy-nilly, upon bin successor when the clock strikes noon on March 4. Students of history will find a curiously Instnictlve parallel (os to time conditions) In n case that occurred almost thirty years ago. Late In the year 1W2, after Orover Cleveland had been elected as Renjamtn Harrison's successor but while Harrison was yet President, the State ftepartment was approached by the Reigian Government with regard to the possible acceptance by Mr. Harrison of an Invitation to act ns mediator between Great Rrltnln and the Congo State In a controversy as to terrltorlsl rights In Africa. On Ifovembcr THE NEfl 53, 181?2, Secretary of 8tate Fosteb nstructed Minister Teucll In com uunicatlon which ended thus: "Having In mind, moreover, the circumstance that the Prealdent'a electoral term will expire on the 4th of March next, thus rendering It Improbable that the euvsested trust could be personally accepted and discharged by the present Incumbent of that high office, I have thought It proper to refrain from taking Mr. HxaaisoN'a direction In the prem i?e&" The' Italics are curs. And good uck, anyway, to Mr. Wiibon's peronal efforts In behalf of much opiressed and long outraged Armenia, i'hose misfortunes and plight comuasd universal sympathy in the Jnlted States! Ikwe the Price Fliers Hurt Honest Business. Besides the general public indlgnalon at the conspiracies In the bulldog Industry, there Is a particular tea o mon ir hnnast hn afnoati man In the first pluce, the collusion beween contractors and labor kings and be price fixing deal among the bulldag material concerns have tended to iake the public auspicious of business a general. Often there has been rhlsperlng about price collusion in nes of business which really were proeedlng In genuine competition. But be public now discovers that an unuspected Industry really was taking dvantuge of it. Every honest busies* man Is sore because of the, hndow thrown on business In general. In the second place, the price fixers truck a severe material blow at the aanufncturlng business. They pre- < ented the building of homes by keeprig the costs too high for the average: uyer. Thus, naturally, they preented the furnishing of homes. Every i ew dwelling that Is built means the urchase of Just so much furniture, ugs, carpets, linoleum, books, picures, china, glnsswnre, cooking uten11s and heating devices. These are < terns upon which Americans spend heir money freely. They are proud f their homes and to furnish them fell they will stint even on food and lothlng. Tens of thousands of people have >een waiting to build houses until ulldlng materials and labor should ome down to something like a possible Igure. The making of the furnishings: or these homes would keep factories olng that must eventually close if , he situation is not relieved by a reurn toward normal costs. But the logs In the building business deter- J lined that there should be not only io return to the normal but a peg- 1 lng of prices at the height they found ] o soft and fat. And yet It Is likely that some of ( hese slick masters of secret card In( ex ay stems went around talking j bout the Importance of their business . o the economic life of the country! Ij 11 Lrjotcin? in Athens and I ucern".1, The reports from Athens indicate hat the plebiscite Sunday resulted l verwhelmlngly in favor of the recall : f CorrsTANTiNE to Greece. This was 1 iractlcally forecast by the election 1 n November 14, when the Venlzelist i Joverriment was overthrown. So far < tfc Greece is concerned the deposeil 1 Ung may now return to the Grecian hrone. Should the Allies, however, urry out the programme suggested, f not explicitly stated, In their Joint I lote, his reinstatement as monarch i vlll cost Greece the friendly interest * if France and Great Britain in inter- t latlonal affairs. i There was no attempt by the Allies < ?the Joint note stated that they had io desire to Interfere In the Internal i iffalrs of Greece?te Influence the re- 1 ult of the elections. This was quite : ipparent from the reports sent out rom Athens, which wefe to the effect i hat even the warning of the Allies egardlng the consequences of the reurn of Cosstantixk received no imminence In the pre-election camin ign, and that a large majority of he voters had no opportunity to conilrlar thi? nonmihlo Imnnrt r?f Itc pph. lomlc nnd financial threats. Athens celebrated the reealt in n lemonstrstion somewhat similar to hat In which it Indulged three year* igo when ConsTAirrrxB left Greece ind Vewixelos returned to power. At lucerne there was also evidence of ejolclng. Switzerland Is to lose one >f its kings In exile, the propaganda >f whose followers had become trou desome to the Alpine yftation.

This monetary relief la attributed to American ind German sources. Whether, when the spasm for a :han*e in government has passed, the Uneek people will or will not find cason for rejoicing over Cotvstaisnwe's return is a matter of conjecure.

The lending figure In a recent story ea liv Melville Davisron Post offered H $3,000,000 for the discovery of the ac- w tive principle of alcohol. He wanted H to muke It puMlc Tind thus destroy ur prohibition. H There are several active principles to that ought to be isolated and then S< destroyed. al The active principle of official ex- of trtragance, If it had been killed in F< 1917, would have saved the United States billions. It Is active yet. The active principle of Industrial th laziness is still at work and may not H subside until It encounters the fumes Ai of a soup house. nc The active principle of graft Is being exposed In the test tubes of Dr. Sam Uktebmveb's laboratory and Is about to undergo prophylactic treat- E ment at the bonds of grand Juries. The offer mndo by Mr. Post's hero was trifling In comparison witn tne value of doing away with these other active principles. ao How Italian Earn'ngs Here flow 81 to It Ay. t0 ell Italian emigrants, whom the FI- pe nance Minister at Rome In his recent mi budget statement classed as an "im- su portant coefficient for the settlement tf< of our economic balance," are again making their force felt by their In- ofl cieased remittances of cash to their &b mother country. In 1910, according ca to a report from Trade Commissioner MacLean at Rome. Italian emigrants fo' sent home the following sums: re From: Lire, Im United States 435,092.497 R' Canada 30.000,000 Brazil 17,000,000 m up Argentina 14,000.000 pQ Venezuela 238,14a pr Uruguay <01,108; Chile 101,972 to V | as Total 494,893,722 1)0 ' ev Average remittances before the war | co nmounted to about 500,000,000 lire 00 annually. In 1917 the amount wag lB only 250,000,000 lire and In 1918 only 237.000,000 lire. . SI in turms in iiiiiiun iiioiibj iui* i?- : pittances for last year were about j equal to pre-war years. But the de-! preclutlon of the Urn has robbed Italy p? of the benefits of the Increased re- j ^ pittances. This is true not only be- ] :ause the higher prices In Italy make; or the larger remittances the equivalent I mi of a smaller number of lire when {ca prices were lower, but also because! Italy's purchases of goods abroad. ^ luve inflated the trade balance against her to eleven times its size before the ,1, war began. Italy's trade deficit was 1.184.000,- ha WO lire, or about $200,000,000, In 1018, and the 500,000,000 lire remit- ^ Lances covered nearly half the deficit. )n] In 1910 the remittances, although the j8 same number of lire as in 1913, cov- jm sred less than 5 per cent, of the 11,- ? 100,000,000 trade deficit c't Italy's sons already may have flfl thought they were equalling their ^ former record by sending home 494.- a J00,0db lire in 1019. but these lire cost jn them only $40,000,000 as compared su with a cost, of $100,000,000 to cover ch the money sent home In 1913. To equal tlieir pre-war remittances in ^ rnlue and to bring them up to the , 1013 ratio of the trade deficit Italy's' m| -ltizens abroad would have to send lni home at present rates of exchange more than five billion lire. Italy's Finance Minister does not ^ expect any such receipts, but he hopes that with more normal conditions the remittances of Italian* f, abroad will be more nearly measured Cu In terms of gold or of dollars. de rei In sending his message to Congress ev by messenger the President returned * yesterday to tho method which was used from 1801 to 1913. 0,1 po ml The walkout In the clothing busl- in; ness which the manufacturers most m< dread Is that of the customers. re - be The Board of Estimate lnvestlga- co tors seem to have dug Into ths Court nv House ashpit for the winter.

Your elimination of "The Bread Winsrs" from the great novels of American % Is clever and unanswerable.

PLANES BARRED FROM U.S. njnnction Blocks Move to Unload 2,365 Machines Bought nt Small Cost. ERIL TO INDUSTRY HERE rder Granted by Judge Mayer Holds Aircraft Infringe Wright Co. Patent. American aircraft manufacturers sucleded yesterday In obtaining a pre'lmlary Injunction restraining British Invests from unloading In the United tates thousand of surplus British war lanes at prices so low as to preclude >mpetltion. The Handley-Page and Aircraft Dls)sal companies, which bought 10,000 sroplanes from the British army for i amount reputed to be 1 per cent. ! their cost, were about to export 2,365 lanes to this country to be sold at ss than $3,000 each. American manuicturers asserted this would ruin the idustry as well as flood the United :ates wifli an obsolete typo of battle lane Inferior to those being built at )me for peace purposes. The injunction was granted to the rright Aeronautical Corporation, owner ' the American patent for heavier than r flying machines, by Judge Julius M. ayer. in the United States District ourt, on the ground that the British ,anes infringe the Wright patent In ndering his decision Judge Mayer ild: "The American manufacturer may, jwever, be trusted to make up his mind i to what Is best for him, and his bltr opposition shows that he considers iat If these machines are brought here id, as defendant states, arc .aid down lty and heavy transportation charges lid, In New York city, or In fact. any. here In the United States, at a price hlch Is but a fraction of their actual ilue, aiich Importation will destroy or avely Impair American Industry In >is regard. "Whatever may be the economic \ lew, e fact Is that the plairitlff Is the owner the patent; that the patent has been ljudlcated ; that the courts have given a high place, and that defendants ive thus far brought Int- this country ily a few planes, and have not, In any nse, established an industry here. "Defendants acquired these planes om the British Government with their -es wide open and took their chances i their legal rights. They state that a preliminary Injunction goes through ralnst them they will lose the market rd thus suffer great loss. This was icir hazard." F. B. Rentschler, vice-president of the rr!ght company, said last night: "The British Government had on hand , the close of the war thousands of anes and engines which are now obs.rte, and which they wished to dump to the United States at prices wnich ere not commensurate with the actual st of production. The United States rmy Air Service attempted to aid the dustry by getting an anti-dumping easure through Congress at its last ssion to prevent the sale of these anes and material, but It was held up f other legislation." JAY DEDUCT LOSSES, EXEMPT MORTGAGES evenue Act Revision to Be Taken Up To-day. ifclal Despatch to Tun New York Herald. New York Herald Hureaa. | Washington. D. C? Ore. 7. 1 Representative Fordney (Mich.), lalrman, In Issuing the call of to-morw's meeting of the Ways and Means mimlttee stated that the meeting was be an Informal discussion of what e committee could do before March 1. One of the first proposals considered ' the suggestion by former Commlsoner of Internal Revenue Roper and I hers that the section of the revenue i t providing that net losses may be ducted from Income and excess profits 1 x returns be reenacted. This provl- ! on expired In December, 1919, the be- ! >f being at the time of the enactment j 1 the revenue act, early in 1918, that ie readjustment would come In 1919. A : rong demand exists for this leglsla-1 >n. The deferment in the December ; lyments may be mentioned, but It is 1 allzed nothing can be done to relieve tercsta which have suffered big losses cently. A third proposal that will be eonlered Is that receipts from mortgages exempted from taxation, provided the rtgage holdings of a taxpayer do not ceed $10,000. This plan has been sug- j stcd as a means of encouraging loans ' r building purposes to relieve the hous- i g shortage, which is general. It was learned the committee was dlded on whether revenue and tariff re- j ion SIlOUIll uc lis mil man, H Ul | mrte being understood that little more an the holding of hearings can be ac mpllshed before the special session of e new Congress. One group of the mmlttee, led by Representative Longorth (Ohio), believes revenue revision lould come first The other, led by rl-msn Fordney, thinks tariff revision ust come first. 1ARTENS HEARINGS IN DEPORTATION CASE END o un*el Denies He Aided Move Against Government.
