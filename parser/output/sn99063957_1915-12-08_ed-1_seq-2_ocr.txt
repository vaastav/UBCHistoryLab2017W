Thus eomnieuled the I,oulon Globe today, the only London paper profess ing to see pumible danger for Ami lea from other powers. fctovernl others, however, criticised Hi Ex-doYernor Fears Railroad Plot to Acquire Title To Pacific Ocean. Since the matter of taxation is a vital issue in the settlement of the O. C. land grant controversy ex-Governor Oswald West today addressed a letter to the state tax commission rela tive to the tide lands in Lincoln coun ty. The letter is self explanatory and follows in full: "Gentlemen: While serving as a pub lic official I initiated a movement to save to the state the tide and marsh lands of Lincoln county, which a waste ful legislature in earlv davs had trrnni- d to tho predecessors of the Corval- us Eastern Railroad company, now the Southern Pacific comcany. A test caso was brought and fought through our state courts and an appeal was taken to the United States supreme court, but judicial respect for vested rights was too strong and title to this"' valuable body of land was confirmed ia the railroad company. "Tho railroad company has never paid taxes on these lands and when this point was brought to public attention and agitation started with a view of havin-them placed on the tax roll,,de lay was secured by reason of the pend ing suit to determine the question of title. But now that tho matter has been settled and in favor of the railroad company, no further reason exists for a failure to assess and tax these proper ties. The value of tho lands is inestimable for they are the gateway to ocean com merce. That tho railroad deems them of great value goes without saying, and there is no reason why taxation should be further delayed. The facts are that the railroad ic playing fast and loose with the public It has filed with the assessor of Lincoln county an alleged list of pnrt of its holdings, but in most cases the listr cover lands that are being occupied and used Dy private owners, and its obvious purpose in offering to pay taxes on those tracts ia to dofeat the private titles therein. But for large areas, of unoccupied tide and marsh lands on Ynquiua and Alsea bays and their trib utaries, which it claims to own and to which in any other than a tax proceed ings great value would bo attached, it is making no return to the assessor. In viow of these circumstances I be lieve your honorable commission should take steps towards having these lands placed on our tax rolls. Tho plain citi zen when he buys a tract of tide laud from tho state is compelled to submit to assessment and taxation. Why, there fore, should this magnificent grant to the railroad stand exempt t "A great deal of sympathy is be ing wasted on this same railroad in some quarters today, oVer tho losses it is said to have sustnined in connection with tho taxation of the O. & C. lnnd grant. Rome of the energy now being applied in this quarter would hotter serve the peopl if devoted towards seeing the railroad pay its fair share of the taxes on its Lincoln county hold ingn. "The railroad company elnhns the ocean beach as part of its grant. I have always been, and am now, firm in my belief that it was not intended thnt t grant should cover the ocean beach and this point should be kept in mind anc' given duo consideration in placing the lands on the assessment roll otherwise the company might, through asserting ita claim to the beech and paying taxes thereon, so intrench itself as to be sM to prevail upon some friendly legisla ture to confirm its title. "Nor should the rights of the upland owners along the bay be overlooked for the railroad iscluiming many acres now held by these shore owners through pa tent from the federal government. "When tho lands, the company right fully owns, are listed for taxation the collection of tho back taxes should be promptly undertaken. Trusting that these matters will re ceive yonr careful consideration, and that such early action will be taken as the circumstances may justify, I am, "Yours respectfully,

This is a recent discovery of Doctor Pierce, who is head of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Inutituto at Buffalo, N. Y. Experiments at Dr. Pierce's Hospital for several years proved that there is no other eliminator of uric avid that can be compared to it. For those easily recognized symptoms of inflam mation as backache, scalding urine and frequent urination, as well as sedi ment in the urine, or if acid in the blood v has caused rhumatisni, it is simply wonderful how Burely "An uria" acts. The best of results are al ways obtained in eases of acute rheum atism in the joints, in gravel ant gout, and invariably the pains and stiffness which so frequently and persistently ac company the disease- rapidly disap pear. Go to your nearest drug .store and simply ask for a oil-cent package of "An-uric" manufactured by Dr. Pierce, or even write Dr. Pierce for a free sample. If you suspect kidney or blad der troublo, send him a sample of your wator and describe -symptoms. Dr. Pierce's chemist will examine it, then Dr. Pierce will report to you without fee or charge. Note: "An-uric" is thirty-seven times more active than lithia in elimi nating urio acid, and is a harmless but reliable chomical compound that may1 bo safely givon to children, but should be used only by grown-ups who actually wish to restore their kidneys to perfect health, by conscientiously using on box or more in extreme cases an "An-uric" (thanks to Doctor Pierce's achievement) is by far the most perfect kidney and bladdor corrector obtain able.
