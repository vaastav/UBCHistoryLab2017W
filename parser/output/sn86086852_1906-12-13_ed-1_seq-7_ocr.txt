REED SMOOT AND POLYGAMV NIT SENATOR BURROWS SCORES THE SOLON FROM UTAH. A RED HOT IMPEACHMENT Chairman of Privileges and Elections Committee Says Polygamy Still Exists—The “Hierarchy’’ Controls in Politics —Name of Utah Brought to Shame and Humiliation. Washington, D. C.. Dec. 12. —In the upper house yesterday. Senator Bur rows of Michigan, chairman of the committee on privileges and elections addressed the solons on the report ot the committee having in charge the matter of Reed Smoot’s right to sit as a representative in the ’ upper house of congress from the state of Utah. Senator Burrows said there had been no proof submitted to sustain the allegation that Mr. Smoot is a polygamist. Mr. Burrows' impeachment was based entirely upon the connection of Mr. Smooth with the governing body of the church, consisting of the pres idency and the twelve apostles. Ho referred to this body as a “hierarchy," and said: “The power exercised by this body Is far-reaching and commanding, hold-! ing in its grasp practically the entire j mefbership of the organization and through it the domination of the state ” He said that “since the admission of Utah into the union the people of the state have been, if possible, more completely under the domination of the Mormon hierarchy than during the long years of their territorial ex istence," and in support of this state ment added: “Immediately and at the very first election thereafter tlie hier archy resumed its domination in state affairs, taking possession practically of every official position in the state government, and has held them ever since with unyielding tenacity. The only office held by a non-Mormon un der the state government during the ten years of its existence, as an elec tive officer, has been the attorney general.** He cited many instances of political interference not only in Utah but ad joining states, and quoted at length the church manifesto of 1896 requit ing members to obtain the consent ot the hierarchy before becoming candi dates for office. He went on: “No more cunningly devised scheme could possibly be concocted to put the church in politics and make It po tential therein than this.” Polygamy Unquestioned. He said that Mr. Smoot’s member ship in the church governing boly which inculcates a belief in poU’garny is conceded. “The evidence upon this point is so complete and overwhelm ing as to leave no doubt as to the truth of the allegation; that a major ity of the members of this hierarchy has continually and persistently lived in polygamy, and is today openly and confessedly defying the laws of tho land prohibiting such crimes. The record is so shocking as to challenge creddlUy.” He spoke in this connection of the astonishment of the committee at the confessions of President Smith and of the revelations of the fact that eight of the twelve apostles have plur al wives, and added; “If the public press is to be credited, this number has been augmented during the last year to forty-three.” Coming to the connection of Senatoi Smoot with the hierarchy Mr. Bur rows said that practically all of is members were polygamists when he became a member. “The vita! question, therefore, is,' he said, "can one become a member of and identify himself with a band j of lawbreakers, knowing them to oe such, participate in their counsels and sustain them in their conferences and yet escape all responsibility for their unlawful acts? Such a contention will not stand the test of either law or reason. “The senator's complicity in encour aging polygamy and polygamous co habitation does not consist wholly in the fact that he is one of the govern ing body of that church. By repeat ed acts he has, —as a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles, given active aid and support to the hier archy in Its defiance of the statutes of this state and the laws of common decency." Disqualified for Membership. Senator Burrows concluded as fol lows “It is submitted that the senator, by becoming a member of and identifying himself with such an organization and partkJpatirg in Its functions, has disqualified himself for membership In this body. An organization that fos ters and encourages crime; tramples upon all law, human and divine; prac tices polygamy and polygamous co habitation; desecrates the home; de

Miss JURY CONVICTS INSURANCE MSN GEORGE BURNHAM, JR., FOUND GUILTY. OF STEALING $7,500 Vice President and General Counsel of Mutual Reserve Life Company —Prosecution and Conviction Out growth of Investigation of Legisla tive Committee. New York, Dec. 12. —George Burn ham, Jr., a vice president and gener al counsel of the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance company, yesterday was convicted of the larceny of $7,500 of the compan; s funds. The prosecu tion and conviction of Burnham was an outgrowth of the investigation of insurance companies in this state by a legislative committee a year ago. Two other officers of the Insurance company, Frederick A. Burnham, president, and George D. Eldridge, vice president, were Indicted at the same time as the man who was con vlcted yesterday. Five indictments were returned against each of the de fendants. The charge against George Burnham, Jr., is that in 1901 lie paid J. Douglass Wells with company funds for a loan alleged to have been made to Frederick A. Burnham, the president, and that the payment was concealed by false entries in the books of the Insurance company. One of the sensational features of the trial which ended yesterday was the production of a check by the prosecution which bore the name of F. Payn, former superintend ent of insurance, and the United States Express company of which Senator Platt is pres* tent. It was not claimed, however, that Burnham paid the amount of this check to Mr. Payn but that it was used to resist an alleged demand by Payn for 

SIOO,- 000 from the life insurance company. The prosecution charged that Pres ident Frederick A. Burnham bor rowed $5,575 from J. Douglass Wells saying that he wanted the money to meet this alleged demand by Payn and that George Burnham repaid this loan with additions from the funds of the company. In charging the jury Justice Green bautn said that in order to arrive at a verdict of guilty it must be found that the alleged fraud was committed witii felonious intent. The jury was out for four hours be fore returning a verdict of guilty. By request of his counsel further proceedings were postponed untG Friday and Burnham was remanded to the Tom s prison, JUDGES LIBEL ACTION FAILS Monroe, Wis., Dec. 12. —The crimln al hbei charge of Judge Becker against Editor Emery Odell was dis missed Tuesday.

Tobacco a'd Fruits the Princi pal Products—Trade Rapidly In creasing—Present Government Is Efficient and Strong—People Have Great Self Respect Washington. l>. C.. Dee. 12.- No vember 21. President Roosevelt visit ed the Island of Porto Rico on his re turn trip from Panama and has re ported his observations to congress in a special message pointing out that it is doubtful if our people as a whole realize the beauty and fettil- Ity of Porto Rico and the progress that hits been made under its admir able government. "We have just cause for pride," he says, "in the character of our representatives who have administered the tropic islands which came under our Hag its a result of the war with Spain; and of no one of them is this more true than of Porto Rico. it would he impossible to wish a more faithful, a more oin dent and a more disinterested pub lic service than that now being ren dered in the island of Porto Rico by those in control of ihe insular gov ernment.“ The work that, has been done in Porto Rico for education is note worthy. The main emphasis lias been put upon primary education: but in addition to this there is a normal school, an agricultural school, three industrial and three high schools. Kvery effort is being made to secure not only the benefits of elementary education to all the Porto Ricans of the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train them so that the industrial, agricultural and commercial opportunities of the Island can he utilized to the best ad vantage. it is evident that the teachers, both Americans and native Porto Ricans, are devoted to their work, take the greatest pride in it, and are endeavoring to train their pupils, not only In mind, but in what counts for far more than mind in citizenship, that is. in character. Evldences of Prosperity. In traversing the Island the he holder is struck with the rapid growth in the culture both of the sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit industry is also growing. Last year was the most prosperous year (hat the Island has ever known. The total of exports and Imports of the island was $15,000,000 against $18,000,000 In 1901. This Is the largest In the Island's history. Prior to the Amer ican occupation the greatest trade for any one year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly $23,000,000. Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that, there was in the most prosperous yiar under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last, year, of the value of $14,186,319; $3,555,163 of tobacco, and 28,290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of $3,481,102. American Citizenship Urged. The president believes that It is desirable that the Porto Ricans lie given the privilege of full American cilzenshlp, and in urging this point says: “I most earnestly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can possibly result from It, and It seems to me a matter of right and justice to the people of Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to he under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride In what they have done, and our pleasure In extending recognition fo f what has thus been done, by granting them full Amerl can citizenship.” Under the administration of the present governor and council, prog ress has been made in the difficult matter of granting to the people of the Island the largest measure of self-government that can with safety t>e given at the present time. It would have been a very serious misiake to have gone any faster in ulg direc tion The Porto Ricans have com plete and ausolute autonomy In all their municipal governments the only power over them posseaesd by the in sula? - government being that of re moving corrupt or incompetent mu nicipal officials. This power has never been been exercised save on the clearest proof of corruption or of Incompetence—such as to jeopardize the interests of the people of ‘he island: and under such circa ms tames it has been fearlessly used to the im mense benefit of the people. It l s not a power with which it would be safe, for the sake of the island Itself, to dispense at present. The lower house is absolutely elective, while the up per house Is appointive. The ma chinery of the elections is admlnis tered entlerly by the Porto Rican people themselves the governor and council keeping only such supervision as is necessary in order to insure an orderly cotton. The elections this year wove absolutely orderlj, uc.vo compatvei by any disturbance: and no proto- has been made against the manager. : of the elections. The govern ,r,d council are cooperating with all of the meet enlightened and most patriotic of the people of l\>rto Rico in educating the citizens of the island in the principles of orderly liberty They are providing a gov eminent based upon each citizen's self-rt spec; and the mutual respect ot all ctd.ons: that Is. declares the president. U sed upon a rigid observ ance of the principles of Justice and honesty u has not been easy to instil into the minds of people un accustomed to the exercise of free lorn the two basic principles of our American system tin principle that the majority must rule, and the prin ciple that the minority has rights which must not be disregarded or trampled upon, yet real progress has been made, concluded the president, in having these principles accepted as elemental y. ns the foundations of successful self government.
