Sliding Around It." Under the above caption (and, as will be seen, a very appropriate one for the article in that paper), the Democrat of last week publishes the decision of fw flnlWtor Geo. II. Belden, in j regard to who are required to take out a broker's license. The Democrat virtu ally acknowledges that all its palaver and wind about the "tax-ridden farmers" is so much ink-slinging for nought, " Mr. Belden s construction is correct !" The Democrat, in search for something on which to get up a tearful and pathetic small-pica leader, strikes a telegram of Nov. 12, and, without lurther inquiry, knowinjr tho class of men he writes for, slops over at once with sympathy for the dear " Republican Farmers " of Oregon. Mr. Gradwohl, a Democrat, presents the Democrat with the decision received from Mr. Belden, deputy collector of internal revenue for Oregon, with a re quest to print it, that farmers may know that his remarks on the question involved were unfounded and only made for buncombe. Finding that sensible men in his own party look with contempt upon this transparent attempt to make party capital by a misrepresentation of facts, he attempts to " slide around it" with the insinuation that Mr. Belden is not auth ority in the matter. This " small pica " concern is either as ignorant as it looks, or it believes that a "lie well stuck to is as good as the truth." The Democrat as serted that farmers- who brought their produce to town and scld it from their Letter From the Capital Salem, December 8, 1869. We had our city clectiou on Monday. Tho result is as was anticipated by al most every one. The politics of the city being Republican officers of that political belief were, in every instance, returned, though there was no agitation of national ideas involved. The members of the old Council were re-elected, which thing pleased them not so much on account of the pay attached as the endorsement of their proceedings last year. The ex penses of the city government for the past year have been larger than ever before. Over three thousand dollars have been disbursed for the fire depart ment alone, and the improvement of streets has been another source of ex pense, yet the people would hardly con sent to be placed back where they were a year ago. 

TRADE Is quiet here as every where else in Or egon at this season, yet the usual amount of business is transacted, as the casual observer will see by visiting the wharf. Considerable activity is noticeable amon the stores and shops where Santaclaus has established his division headquarters. Fine display of books, pictures, etc., can be seen at J. K. Gill's, on State street, and at Yeaton & Boon's, on Commercial itreet. For watches and jewelry Martin can suit the fastidious, while toys, dolls, and such like, are to be found at Uza fovagc & Wright's.

Gold discoveries have been, made, the like whereof has never been seen am the American continent. I , Hqn. J. H. Mitchell is to deliver a lecture at Eugene City on the evening of the 15th inst, under the auspices of the Odd Fellows. This will be the sec- end lecture of the course. i The. question of building a railroad . -from Corvallis to , Yaquina Bay is still eiBj agitated. David Newsom, in the Gazette, says that the harbor at Yaquina naa tne advantage by one Hundred mil- v lion dollars over any other point on the . sonsV San Francisco and Paget Sound alone excepted. The President has appointed Jaa. H. Fisk to examine and report upon the Oregon Railroad, vice Jesse Applegate, resigned. , Capt. Fisk is one of the pro prietora of the Standard Flooring Mills, at Blilwaokie, and is said to be a well- . Jaformed, clever gentleman, and one ev ery way qualified, for the appointment. The commission now stands : Rev.' E. Ii. Geary, of this eity, Thos. A. Savier, of" Portland, and Jas. H. Fisk. There, is a curiosity io Eola, Polk d'oonty, in the shape of a deformed pig, : A sow, the property of Mr. James Fom- pelley, gave birth recently to a litter of bead, including the ears, body and tail of . ao. eiepfeaot, with the feet and legs of a pig, , It has a veritable trunk, and only one .eye, which is located nnder the trunk ; Ms no hair, except a few hog bristles around the eye ; the. -body is black and- white spotted, as is common to the genus pig. ; , I. ... , , , .:. . Maxim-foe the lazy : ' jNo farmer can plow a field by turning it over in his and business it is to know whereof he speaks, asserts that the farmer who sells from a wagon his own produce is not a produce broker, therefore is not com pelled to take out a license. Here is a flat contradiction of the Democrat's asser tion from one who knows the law. Tbe Democrat sees the dilemma it has got into it must either get out of the diffi culty by acknowledging that its remarks were made without a knowledge of the facts, and thus thiow a doubt on all the j assertions hitherto uttered or that may hereafter emanate from it, or take the easier (because more natural to Demo cratic ink-slingers) method of casting doubt as to whether Mr. Belden is capa ble of deciding the point in controversy. Misstating facts comprises the whole stock in trade of these fellows. Take from them this blessed privilege and their " occupation's gone." For the information of the Democrat we give two paragraphs from the Internal Revenue Record, a paper published under the sanction of that Bureau. - The first paragraph appeared Sept. 4th, 1 869, in that journal, and is an extract from a letter of instructions to the Internal Rev enue Assessor at Augusta, Georgia, from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and is as follows : The exemption of persons peddling fruits and Tegetables is, 1st, when the fruit and reijctable are the product of their otc farm and garden ; and 2d, when traveling on foot. A person trav eling with one or more horses or mules, peddling vegetables, not the product of hi own farm or garden, is liable as a peddler. The above paragraph agrees " to a hair " with the decision of Deputy Col lector Belden, which we published last week, and is sufficient to convince any sane man that the position taken by tbe Democrat is false and without the least show of sense or reason. The same paper of October 9th, 1869, contains a letter of instructions from the Commissioner to the Assessor at Wil mington, Delaware, from which wc ex tract as follows : Farmers whose occupation it is to sell the pro ducts of their farms away from the place of pro duction and at a store or stand, are liable to special tax as produce brokers. Persons selling in the way described in your letter come in com petition with dealers who pay tbe special tax, and to exempt the fanner from the tax who is doing the same business would be manifestly un just. Occasional act, however, do not create a liability to the special tax, and as it is believed to be the policy of the law to place as few restric tions as is consistent on agricultural producers, the statute should be construed liberally. The Commissioner has at all times and by repeated decisions held that farmers who sold their own produce were not subject to the produce broker's tax ; and that they only became, subject to such tax or license when they bought and trafficked in the produce of their neigh bors, or sold from a stand or store. We hope our cotemporary will hereafter better inform himself with regard to the subject upon which he treats, and that he will adhere as closely to the truth as party fealty and his Democratic instincts will admit. their first Win ter with us. They had heard of the Webfoot rains, and the deep mud so often, that they dreaded to see a cloudy day. But this Winter convinces them that the horrid stories circulated in Cal ifornia and other places about our wet Winters are exaggerated. Speaking of wet seasons, I will just stop to say that the rain fall here is not so great as in many other places in the United States. A few days since I examined a rain chart and found that the rain fall of the Wil lamette Valley was given at 42 inches, while that of Indiana, Illinois, Ohio and Western New York I was put down at from 42 to 45 inches, 'and parts of Cali fornia at 48 and 50 inches. 

MONEY MATTERS Are easier here than could reasonably have been expected six months ago, and th.c financial distress predicted by ihe Democrats in the Spring is net upon us, Telegraphic Summary. Congressional. Chicago dates of the 6th to the Oregonian are as follows : Ihe Senate met at noon, 54 members present. Drake introduced bill regula ting and defining jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, and prohib iting any Court from declaring any act or joint resolution of Congress with re ference to reconstruction, invalid on account of supposed unconstitutionality. Williams introduced a bill regulating the importation of Chinese and making it a penal offense for any party to enter into a contract for bringing Chinese into the country ; but the bill docs not forbid voluntary immigration. Several bills relating to the admission of Georgia, were introduced ; also one removing all political disabilities incur red on account of participation in the rebellion, when the Fifteenth Amend ment shall be duly ratified and become a part of the Constitution. Unfinished business pending at the close of the last session came up, being the question of compensation to North ; Carolina Senators. The President's Message was received and read. Sumner moved to print 100, 000 copies. Referred to Committee on Printing. The Senate held a short executive session and soon after adjourned. House met at noon ; quorum present; Objection was made to receiving Sher vaid and Fox, members from Alabama, and they were not sworn in. After a brief recess the President's Message was received and read. That portion relating to Georgia received ap plause on tho Republican side, of the house. Messrs.Charves, of New Mexico, Gar fielde, of Washington Terrisory, and the Delegstes from Montana and Wyoming, were sworn in. Farnsworth introduced a bill declaring that Virginia had complied with all the reconstruction acts of Congress, and authorizing the immediate admifsion of Representatiues from that State.

Discord is apprehend ed among the Italians. Antonelli shakes his head at the performance in which he never felt any symphathy.

STATE ITEMS. From the Jacksonville Sentinel , we learn that 13. F. Dowell started for Wash ington City on the 3d inst., to urge upon Congress the jivuieot of 'he Indian war claims of 1854. The same pa per says that a young man by the name of Wetzel, who has been working in the tin trade for some time past at this place, was seized with a strange fit of hallucination, last Thurs day night. lie fancied he was wedded to the handsome and accomplished daugh ter of a respected citizen of this place, and insisted ou sending the old gentle man out on the Ranch, and "keeping hotel" himself for a while. The old gentleman could not '.see it in that light, and as the infatuated young man persisted in taking possession of the establishment by force if necessary, the City Marshal was called in, and he was taken to the calaboose. From a communication to the Sentinel, dated at Klamath Agency, Nov- 29th, we learn that the expedition under Su perintendent Meacham, whose object was to collect the scattered bands of Snake Indians, and bring them to the Klamath Reservation, has met with pretty good success. J. D. Applegate and party reached Sprague River valley on the 26th ult., with 200' Indians, under Chief O'che-ho, and located them at Yianex, in the above valley, about forty miles east notwithstanding we have had no extra j Jet ,scovl;re,d- . , . a i. -a? i a !

Notwithstanding the elegant buildings erected the past Summer. improvement is not vet satisfied. Mr. Mallory is peparing to build an imposing brick structure on the corner where the Capital Hotel stood, to be used asa hotel, and the Commercial Hotel Company, with Messrs L. F. Groover, John. F. Mil ler, Geo. A. Eads, and others, as stock holders, are going to put up a hotel of pallatial proportions on the corner of Trade and Commercial streets, near the long bridge. This building, when com pleted, will be equal in all its appoint ments, except in size, to the Occidental hotel in San Francisco. Major Berry burned a kiln of one million of brick just as the rainy season set in, yet every brick is engaged. amusements. Now that Reed's Opera House is so nearly completed, we have some kind of amusement every week. To-night the Salem Dramatic Troupe, assisted by Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Bates, play " Nick of the Woods." This piece, and the talent of the players, promise to bring out a full house.. D. Our municipal election passed off quie ly in the extreme, the only real contest being for the Treasurer. Party issues were not made and the old officers were reelected with the exception of Chapman, who has other duties to perform, in con sequence of which Glover was promoted to his place and Brown was made Alder man instead of Glover. The total- vote was 451, nearly one-half the number of legal voters in the city. Capt. L. S. Scott received for Mayor 372 votes. H. Y. Thompson, far Recorder, had a majority of 115; J. N. Glover for Marshal, 93; A. N. Gilbert for Treasurer, 44. The Alder men elect are, in the 1st ward, R. Will iams and W. L. Wade; 2d ward, J. G. Wright and J. L. Starkey ; 3d ward, L. S- Skiff and B. F. Drake; 4th ward, J. H. Bridges and J. C. Brown. States man. - : ' 1 will not be long before we are call ed to admit some Territories as States into the Union. Among others, Dakota will present fair claims for consideration. Villages and settlements are being rap idly established, there. This past sum mer some five thousand immigrants made their homes inj that Territory. The present population is reckoned at twenty thousand, and forty-seven thousand acres of land have been lately taken up under the Homestead and Preemption laws by actual settlers. ; Henry Sanders, aged 16, and Hannah Sanders, his wife, aged 14 years, passed through Kansas City, Mo., on the 4th inst. They were from Do Kalb county, 111., and on iheir way to settle on a farm in Bates county, in that State. The youthful husband said his father-in-law had fitted him out with a team and $500 in cash, and that he was on his way to settle in a new country and make a fortune by buying a farm. the men. They gave him several blows on the head and face. Washington, Dec. 6. Gen. R. R. of Klamath Agency. The Indians exr pressed themselves as pleased with their new home, and the indications are that by judicious management they will be no turther trouble. These Indians are known as the Warner band of Snakes, and include all the Indians in the Camp Warner and Goose Lake country Including the Silver and Summer Lake Snakes, headed by "Choctoot," that came in a year ago, and some 25 of the same band, brought on to the Reserva tion in the last few weeks, there are now in Sprague River Valley 300 wild Snakes. At last accounts, Supt. Meacham was yet at Camp Harney, working energetic ally to increase the success of his expe dition, though on account of the lateness of the season, and counter influences, he will probably succeed in bringing but few of the- Harney Indians on to the Reservation this winter, but it is thought that he will so prepare their minds that he will be able to locate them all on the Klamath Reservation in the Spring. So it seems that Supt. Meacham has not verified the prophesies of his calumnia tors, but has taken the only part of the year when these savages were to be got together in anything like numbers, and has really succeeded in getting a large number of them on the Keservation We haven't the least idea these fellows who have been accusing "Meachem & Co." of an attempt to defraud the Gov eminent by undertaking impossibilities, now that the impossibility has proven a .success, will mention the tacts above re lated , for if they do it will prove their little stories to have been manufactured from whole cloth, and written out of a pure spirit of malevolence and wicked detraction. Henry York, says the Jacksonville Sir Jhon Franklin discovered the Northwest passage before he perish ed. Time borders on eternity.

This important expedition, comprising a well equipped army of five thousand men and several steel steamers, built in England, constructed so as to be taken to pieces at the rapids, and put together again in the river above them, has left Lower Egypt en route for the great lakes from which flow the head streams of the Nile. The objects are the annexation of the whole Nile valley to its head in the great elevated basin of the Equador to the vice-royalty of Egypt, and to put all those wild tribes of the upper valley and basin to the cultivation of cotton. tacking him suddenly was the cause of his fall. OUR MINISTER WITHDRAWN! P. A Queer Law Suit. One Captain Herbert won a remarkable law suit in Adair county, Iowa, the other day a suit conducted on both sides of the North river. The plaintiff and his lawyer lived on one side of tbe river, and the defend ant, his lawyer, and the magistrate on the other. The parties met on either bank of the stream, which was too high to be crossed. The " Court" took his seat on a damp log, and ordered the trial to pro ceed. For one hour and a half the attor neys slung law and logic across a hun dred feet of September freshet, at tbe expiration of which period the ; Court mounted a stump, and, lifting up bis voice to a frightful pitch,; hurled his decision across the stream. I Female Voters. It is stated that a large number of females are entitled to vote at the municipal election of the towns of England. At Lincoft, 300 female voters are on the registry ; at Stanford, 150 ; at East Relford, 60, out of 514 voters on the list ; and at Norwich, 1,500, out of a total of 10,000. From these facts it is argued that in ten years' time,' the majority of the women in England will enjoy the right to vote, Better. The Revolution heads an article " Something better than the Bajlot for Woman." Jinks says he knows what it is a baby! ; The Jacksonville debating society will discuss the question of 'Woman Suf frage" at its next meeting. Chinese Here. II. C. Bennett, Secretary of the Chinese Protection So ciety, has issued his report, giving the number of arrivals from China since 1849, and other matters of interest. The report informs us that in the last twenty years China has sent to this coast 133, 58G souls, of whom 37,323 have return ed to China, and 10,420 have died. The whole number of Chinese now in this country is given at 90,837, 41,000 oi whom are in California, 7,000 in Ne vada, 12,000 in Montana, 10,000 in Idaho, 8,000 in Oregon, 8,500 along the line of the Pacific Railroad, and 4,000 in Colorado, Utah and the Southern States. Of the 41,000 in California, there are 4,800 females, 3,000 children, 1,307 old and decrepid, and 183 in jails and the penitentiaries, leaving 31,700 male adults of whom 14,000 are in San Francisco. Of those in the interior counties 2,550 are females, 1,259 are children, 1,350 old, maimed and in jails, leaving 18,550 active adult males, (500 of whom are engaged in mining, and the balance in various employments. The report further says : " It is a great mistake on the part of the laboring classes to imagine that the Chinamen injures white laborers. - If the supply of labor decreased its value in proportion to its increase, the. United States would be the worst country in the world for laboring men, because there has been a steady stream of laborers from all countries pouring into them for nearly a half century. Labor has in creased in value by the influx of this mind, bone and muscle, till the United States is the laborers' paradise. The advent of the Chinese will not alter the law which causes the demand for labor to increase with its supply. "The working classes derive most of the benehts ot the cheap labor of the Chinese. The price of fruits, vegeta bles, meats, butter, coarse clothing, ci gars, board and , lodging, is made lower by the aid of these people, and almost every branch of manufacture would cease without their cheap labor. Their influence on business is demon strated by the efforts mude to secure their custom. Most of the large American stores and warehouses have Chinese signs in 'their windows and keep Chinese clerks to attend to the Chinese business. The idea that they live on rice and garb age is too absurd to deserve notice. Such of them as can afford good living enjoy it as much as any other class in the community. The dinners set by them for Governor Haight and his friends was equal to auy banquet given by the Europeans in this city, in point of extravagance and luxury, if not accord ing to American taste. notwithstanding all this C.
