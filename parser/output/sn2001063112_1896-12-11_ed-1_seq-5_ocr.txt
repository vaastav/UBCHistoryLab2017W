PRESIDENTIAL VIEW MUCH OF MR. CLEVELAND'S MES SAGE DEVOTED TO CUBA. Ppnin'i Inability to End the Contest Will HP the Signal For Action—When Thai Time Avrive» the Method of Frocednri May Be Plain—Country Congratulated mi the Keinlt of the Election. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Both house» of congress assembled at noon. Almost immediately the president's messagt was read. It proved to be a very vol uiniiious document, about 17,000 words. The opening sentences refer to the late election. "As representatives of the people id the legislative branch of their govern ment," the president says, "you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institution!, mid the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decreo of free and independent suf frage, without disturbance to our tran quility or the least sign of weakness in ,mr national structure. "When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have suc ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions, we discover abundant evidence ot a determination on the part of oui countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dis position which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can (inly be prompted by a serius apprecia tion of tho trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites." Tlie Cuban Question. The most interesting as well as most important portion of the message ii that which deals with foreign affairs. The Venezuelan boundary question, the president says, has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States. The insurrection in Cuba, however, still continues, with all its perplexities. It is difficult to per ceive that any progress has thus far been made towards tho pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs, as depicted in my last annual message has in tho least, improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland coun try. If the determination of Spain to put down tb insurrection seems but to strengthen ,th the lapse of time, and is evinced toy her unhesitating devotion of largely in reased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, character and resource, and are none the less in flexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the object for which they took up arms. Mean time the country is being ruined indus trially and commercially. Spain, the president says, should grant real auton omy which, he believes would be satis factory to the majority of the insur gents. In concluding the subject he says: A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the con gress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests as well as a regard for the interests of nations and their citizens joined by considerations of humanity and a de sire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our government to such action as will snbserve the interests thus involved, and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. In regard to the Union and Central Pacific railroad defaults the president says that unless something is done prior to Jan. 1, he deems it to the best inter est of the country to begin foreclosure proceedings. The retirement of greenbacks is again urged because of the danger to the gold reserve. The various departmental reports are given brief mention and reeommenda' tion. Civil service is commended and the good work of the interstate com merce commission noticed. The message closes with an appeal for economy in expenditure.

OLNEYJNCUBA. ••PPleuientary Report to Congress by tlie WASHINGTO"'Dee.°8.—POR the firsJSA'D time within the memory of old officials! the secretary of state has made a regu-1 l®r report to the president, for trans- I "accos mission to congress, like the reports of other officer of the cabinet. This re port was laid before congress as an ap pendix to the president's message. It treats of many details of our relations daring the past year with foreign gov ernments that either were not touched upon in the message or were more briefly treated. Under the head of Spain, Secretary Olney has much to say in regard to Cuba, and in his report he sets out in great detail the history of the growth of the rebellion, tlie present evil state of affairs on the island and other facts upon which the president bases his broad statements and conclusion. No reference is made to a report from Con sul General Lee, but the secretary in timates that this information comes principally from the United States con suls, and so must be regarded as con fidential as to its source. The secre tary's estimate of the present situation, is disclosed in the following paragraph, made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the industrial re sources of Cuba: "From whatever point of view we regard the matter, it is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at our doors alike dangerous to good re lations, destructive of legitimate com merce, fatal to the internal resources of Cuba, and most vexatious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its domestic ad ministration, and in its outward rela tions. This situation cannot indefin itely continue without growing still worse, and the time may not be far dis tant when the United States must se riously consider whether its rights and interests, a6 well as its international duties in view of its peculiar relations to the island do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." 

INVITED THE BOLTERS. Republican Silver Senators May Attend the Party Caucus. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—When the de­ termination was reached to hold a Re publican caucus an interesting situa tion at once presented itself. The sil ver Republican senators who bolted the St. Louis platform and ticket were an unknown quantity in their political affiliations, and whether or not to in vite them to attend the Republican cauous was an undecided matter. Many conferences were held. Senator Chandler of New Hampshire was par ticularly active in recommending that the bolters be notified of the cauous, which is practically an invitation to at tend. Senator Chandler took the posi tion that the votes of these men would be needed in passing a tariff bill. Sen ator Quay, it is understood, took the same view. It was finally concluded that notices should be sent them as be' fore. This result Placed the Burden of Action on tlie silver Republicans. They con' ferred until late to settle upon a line of policy. Senator Dubois of Idaho is, or was, secretary of the caucus. He will resign this place, as he has been more active than many of the others in the recent campaign and was one of the most urgent in advocacy of a bolt at St. Louis. There has been a ten dency among some Republicans to pursue a conciliatory course toward the silver Republicans and especially as a number of them have declared in favor of protection, and Senator Man tle's paper has been quite positive in this direction. It is not believed that either Senator Pettigrew, Senator Man tle or Senator Cannon will attend the caucus, although they would not be re quired to indicate their views. The purpose of the caucus is to outline a programme for the session. Pension BUI .Reported. WASHINGTON-, Dec. 8.—The first appro priation bill of the session has been finished by the house committee on appropriations, and reported to the house, so that it may be passed this week. It is the pension bill, which carries a total of $14.' ,268,680,a decrease of about $66,000 from the estimates of the commissioner of pensions. STRIKE IS SPREADING. Quay Laborers, Engineers and Bargemen Out at Hamburg. HAMBURG, Dec. 5.—At a meeting -of the central strike committee here, it was decided to declare a general strike and a pamphlet was issued calling upon all quay laborers, engineers, bargemen, lumpers and car men to quit work in order to bring the business of tlie port to a complete standstill. The majority of the quay laborers have obeyed the call and the remainder will probably quit work at noon. A detachment of 200 police from Ber lin has been ordered to this city to as sist the local force in maintaining or der during the strike. Refuse to Onload Hamburg Ships. LONDON, Dec. 5.—A special dispatch received hore from Antwerp announces that the dock loborers there are refus ing to unload vessels arriving from Hamburg. A general strike is feared. Burned a Soore of Buildings, SHAWS, Miss., Dec. 7.—About 2:30 a. m. a fire was discovered in *he rear of W. N. Smith's store, and in less than an hour 21 store buildings and five dwellinas, were burned to the ground, entailing a loss of $70,000 or $85,000. The fire was evidently the work of in cendiaries. Coinage for November. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—The statement of the director of the mint 6hows that during the month of November, 1896, the total coinage at the mints of the United States was $7,458,722, of which $4,064,700 was gold, $2,305,022 silve» and $89,000 miujirfcoius. WEYLER HEMMED IN T° B" I SURR0UNDED BY THE INSURGENTS. Army Oil Either Side and Forces Have Daily Skirmishes—Movement on Foot to Capture Weyler If He Attempts to Kscape. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 7.—A spe cial to The Citizen from Key West says: The steamer Whitney brought Havana news in relation to Maceo and Weyler. Passengers state that Weyler himself is now encamped within 10 miles from Artemisa and his army is scattered along the trocha and through Pinar del Rio district. When Maceo retreated from Weyler in his first campaign his plan was to surprise Weyler at the first opportun ity, and now Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler, and they are having daily skirmishes. Weyler is Completely Hemmed in, and if he shall attempt, to move he will be compelled to go to Artemisa. Small bands have crossed the trocha into Havana district and are attacking the outposts and villages of that province. Insurgents numbering 7,000 are en camped in Havana province, 20 miles from Havana, and will go to Maceo's assistance when needed. Spies in Havana are keeping the insurgents posted as to the movements of the Spauish posts. A movement is on foot to capture Weyler if he shall attempt to go to Havana by rail. Firemen and volunteers in Havana are Using Sent to Weyler'* Belief. Heretofore these troops were used in the defense of the city. Since Tuesday's raid on Quanabacoa the city has been attacked almost every night and Thursday night 2o0 Cuban cavalry rode for two hours through the city. The damage done amounts to 36 houses burned and a large quantity of supplies and ammu nition seized also a large number of mules loaded and ready to leave the city were taken. HAVANA IS EXCITED. Insurgents Very Industrious in the Vicin ity of That City. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 7.—The day's Havana advices report an excit ed confliot of opinion there as to whether the foroing of the trocha by the Cubans Saturday was by guerilla bands or by the vangaard of Maceo's army in a movement to unite with Go mez. Spaniards have given no definite news from the front for a week, and at the same time have redoubled their censorship of the press. Sharp firing has been heard again in Havana from the neighborhood of Quanabacos and other suburbs of that section, and all Havana is exoited over the occurrence. Over 500 refugees have passed into the city during the past five days from that section, fearing for their lives dur ing the fights between the soldiers and the insurgents. Nearly all the Havana volunteers have gone to the front, but as fast as they rout the guerrillas in one place they encounter them in another, mak ing a succession of running fights, all within 5 or 10 miles of the city. About 100 soldiers have been killed or wound ed so far in these engagements. Probably Only a Wlih. MADRID, Dec. 7.—A report reaches here from Havana that Antonia Maceo has gone to New York to consnlt with the Cuban revolutionary committee there. Spanish Soldiers Landed* HAVANA, Dec. 7.—The steamers Cat' aluna and Isle de Panaya, having on board 2,550 soldiers, have arrived here. VENEZUELA ACCEPTS. Satisfied Wltli the Agreement Between England and tha United States* WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The following statement given out by the state depart ment embraces all of the information in the possession of the department re specting the treatment by Venezuela ol the proposed arbitration treaty: "Secretary Olney has received a tele gram frcm Minister Andxade at Caracas to the effect, in substance, that the memorandum agreed upon between tha United States and Great Britain for the settlement of the "Venezuelan boundary question is accepted by the Venezuelan government that the memorandun will be published at Caracas at onct and that an extra session of the Vene zuelan congress will be called as soon as possible in order that the memor andum may be carried into effect by the necessary treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela." Suspect tlie roisoner. MILWAUKEE, Dec. 8. —Positive prool has keen secured by detectives that Baker Figlesthaler's flour was doctored with an ounce of arsenic, and an arrest will probably be made in a few hours. No deaths have occurred as ft result ot the foul deed, but nearly 290 people's lives were imperiled by partaking ol bread bought from the bakery, which it on the north side of the city. Colonel Fellow* Dead. NEW YORK, Dec. 8.—Colonel John R. Fellows, district attorney of New York, and former member of congress, is dead, after an illness which bad con fined him to his bed from about tin time of his return from an electioneer ing tour of the Middle Western states. Given Ten Day* In Irons. NEWPORT, R. I., Dec. 8.—Forty ap prentice boys who escaped from tht naval station here were tried and sen tenced to 10 days in Rouble irons. Th« cases of the two ringleaders were re ferred to the commander, who is now in Washington. The Indian Famine. LONDON, Dec. 7.—The Chronicle sayn it hears that independent reports an tioipate that, despite the rains, th famine will be by far the worst e*ei known in India. THE WATERS RECEDE. IHver at Ohippawa Falls Has Dropped More Than Four Feet. CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis., Dec. 8.— True to its past traits the Chippewa rose 10 incheB during the night, but be gan its downward course at daylight. At 5 p. m. the water is gone six inches lower than at any time since the flood. A fall of 51 inches is indicated. The universal opinion is that the worst has been met and a feeling of security is once more settling over the city. Should the weather remain at all mod erate it is thought the ice gorge be tween this city and Eau Claire will be rapidly eaten away by the strong cur rent which prevails between these points. The Wisconsin Central has a force of men at work chopping its tracks and depots on River street out ot the ice and generally repairing their damage. The Milwaukee people are doing likewise, while the 'inundated buildings and sidewalks are being Cleared otf Their Weight of Ice. Street Commissioner Aekley proposes to begin with men and teams at once to remove the ice from the flooded streets. Many of the merchants who were driven out by the flood are getting back into their old stands, the sight seers are migrating, eleotrio lights once more illuminate the benighted streets of a once threatened city, and there is every sign that we are to be spared a time longer. Monday the city was full of sightseers from St. Paul, Minneapo lis, Milwaukee and, in fact, from every other place along the several lines of railroads entering the city. The Cen tral had an excursion from Medford and intermediate points for this pur pose alone. Railroad traffic is resumed. The reports in certain papers that gen eral distress and suffering reigns as a result of the flood is absolutely untrue and on a par with ths many other reck less dispatches published with reference to the high water here. A RIVAL OF CARNEGIE. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Com pany Going Into Steel Business. CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—A morning news paper makes the following announce ment: John D. Rockefeller is seeking to out do Andrew Carnegie as the iron king, and has plans already matured and about to be carried out aiming at that end. The Standard Oil company, dl rected by Rockefeller, will be the foe of the Scotchman. The company has pur chased in South Chicago along the shore of Lake Michigan and at the mouth of the Calumet river a plot of ground several acres in extent and with a water.frontage of 3,200 feet. On this it is said roller mills will be ereoted to cost $10,000,000, possibly twice that amount. With this plant for man ufacture, with the Vast Mines in the Mesaba Region for the raw product, and with 18 huge lake vessels to carry the ore to the very doors of the works—all owned by the Rockefeller company—that corporation may be able to dictate terms to Mr. Carnegie and his associates instead ot being dictated to. The new mills at South Chicago will not be confined to the manufacture of steel rails but will make structural iron of all sorts as well. It is stated fur ther and on good authority that Mr. Rockefeller may even go into the armor plate business also. The site of the nfew works is ideal for a mammoth roll ing mill. Mr. Horr Will Beoover. PLAINFIELD, N. J., Dec. 7.—The condition of ex-Congressman Roswell G. Horr is much improved. No com plications of a serious order have yet appeared, and the family and physi cians believe Mr. Horr will recover. LATEST MAEKET REPORT. Minneapolis Grain. MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 8.

Argus-Leader: The yearbook of the Dakota conference, Methodist Episco pal church, has just been issued and gives a very interesting: exhibit of the progress of that denomination in the state. The Dakota conference compri ses all the territory in the state east of the Missouri river, and the statistics do noj include the work ot the Black Hills conference, which is no small part of the work of Methodism in South Da kota. The year book contains the list of appointments for the new conferenca year, the standing committees of the annual conference, missionary appro priations, the proceedings of the an nual conference recently held at Ver million, reports of oommittees, statis tics of each charge within the confer ence, and a directory of the Epworth Leagues. There are 101 pastoral charges in the conference, all of which have regularly appointed pastors. There are 135 churches and fifty-nine parsonages, with preaching services held at 210 places. There are 9,413 members: 204 Sunday schools with 11, 40! scholars: eighty-five Epworth Leagues with an enrollment of 3,088 thirty-nine junior societies having a membership of 1,400. The total valu ation of church and parsonage property is $321,850 155,531 was raised for min isterial support: $9,237 for missions, church extension, education and other benevolent purposes, and $10,094 cov ered the incidental expenses of the churches and Sunday schools. These figures show an increase of several thousand dollars over the previous year, and are a sure indication of re turning prosperity bGth within the de nomination and state. Six hundred and twenty-three baptisms indicate at least double that number of accessions through evangelistic efforts of the pas tors. The financial exhibit of Dakota university of Mitchell is very gratify ing. All expenses have been met, and the indebtedness reduced. The college property is worth at a conservative valuation $75,000, and the indebtedness is only about $6,500. Under the able management of President Graham the college ranks with the beat institution in the state. The year book, from which these facts are gleaned, was ed ited and published by tho secretary of the conference, Rev. J. P. Jenkins of Madison, aud came from the job press es of the Madison Sentinel. It is a creditable work and will prove of great interest to the ministers and members of the Methodist church. By adding an average of 20 per cent, to these fig ures the lull strength of Methodism in South Dakota may be obtained.
