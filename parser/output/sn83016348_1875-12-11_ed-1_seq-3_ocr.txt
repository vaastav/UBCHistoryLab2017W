Three fellows had been l disposing of them quite extensively in Wil- I miugton to firms there, when the arm of the law was interposed. The Commercial gives the following account of their opera tions, arrest, &c.: “John Halahan, J. H. Ford and Lam bert de Neuekerke, the three New York parties who were arrested on Wednesday for peddling an advertising circular resem bling a greenback note, had a bearing be fore U. S. Commissioner Smith, at the i Jury Room, in the U. 8. Building. U. S. Attorney Higgins was present, but the de- I fendants were without counsel, stating that j the party for whom they were working had promised to employ a lawyer for them, but had not done so. Mr. Charles Garrett, of Garrett, Finley & Co., testified that his firm had bought six thousand of the green backs of Halahan, for $31.30 cash; Martin Alsberg testified that be bad bought twelve thousand from Ford, giving his note for $43, at four mouths; and J. W. Canary that he had bought six thousand of de Neu ekerke for S3O on a note. These facts were not denied by the defendants, and the only question for the Commissioner was whether the advertisement was such as is forbidden by the U. S. law. He decided that it was, and ordered each of the defendants to find bail in SIOOO for their appearance at the next terra of the U. S. District Court. This they said they were unable at present to do, though they hoped that the New York parties by whom they were employed, called the “Novelty Advertising C 0.,” i would provide the necessary bail. They ; therefore remained in the custody of the U- S. Marshal, for the present, until it shall be ascertained whether they can pro cure bail.” They are still in jail. The Commissioner has reduced their bail to S3OO each, but there is nothing being done, apparently, to furnish it. For The Ce il Whig. The Elkton Building Sociely.

SUNDAY SCHOOL INSTITUTE The Institute which assembled in the | Presbyterian Church last Monday and Tuesday was au exceedingly interesting , and instructive meeting. The bad weather i - kept many away who would otherwise have j come; but notwithstanding the rain and | ■ darkness, both evenings saw a large and interested audience. There could be no more decided test of the iuterest of our • community iu the Sunday School cause, than the rainy evenings of Monday and j Tuesday. The range of topics under dis cussion embraced the leading points of intertest in the practical work of the school. 1 The Pastor of the Presbyterian Church welcomed the ministers and delegates in I , the name of the Sunday School and the Church, and Rev. Mr. Rogers, of Glasgow, [ opened the discussions, by showing where j the Sunday School stood in the work of the | church. Prof. Mackey, of Delaware Col- j lege, read an interesting paper upon “ Adult i 1 j Class in the School.” This important topic i called out much instructive comment and important testimony, and the general dis cussion showed with what increasing favor the idea of adult scholars is being regarded. ‘ This discussion was highly beneficial, and will, 1 think, lead to the establishment of these classes iu many of our schools. An infant school teacher from Wilmington, communicated a very interesting and prac tical paper on “ The Infant Class.” This paper was full of the practical details of the work, and elicited much favorable comment from the members present. W. A. Wisong, i Esq., of Baltimore, the Superintendent of . a large school in the Lutheran Chuch, as well as of the seven or eight hundred in mates of the Penitentiary, added much interest to the discussions of the various topics. Being a man of large and ready Sunday School knowledge and experience, be always spoke with profit to his hearers; and none present on Tuesday evening will forget the lesson he taught a class of young scholars, on the topic “ Mary at the Sepul chre,” being the lesson for December slh in the international series. If ail teachers could so clearly and thoroqghly teaph these 5 lessons, there would never he any listless . ness or dullness in our schools. Mr. Wisong . is an earnest and attractive Sunday School speaker, who is abreast with the times, and j who wields a large influence for good.— . Rev. E. W. Gaylord, of Kent county, Md., laid down an outline w hiph, if every teacher would fill up, none need trouble themselves | , with the question, “ How to keep my class full?” .las. T. McCullough made an inter > estiug and instructive address on the “Rela tion of the School to Missions,” which was a careful survey of the important connec tions of the school with the aggressive work of the church. Rev. G. F. Jones, of Lower Brandywine, read an exceedingly jnterest • i ing paper on the topic, “Shall we dispense 1 j witli the Library.” This was a full, fair i | and exhaustive discussion, establishing be- J yond a doubt, that if the Libiary is selected with rigid scrutiny, it cannot but wield an unmeasured power for good. Rev. F. B. - DuVal, of Wilmington, addressed the In - stilute upon the “ Teacher, qualifications i and work.” Mr. DuVal thoroughly ex i hauslcd his subject in a warm and lively discussion of its merits. These topics were r handled with great freedom and fairness . by the various members of the Institute; . and it is, without a doubt, that all were pleased and profited. Thp were . interspersed vyitfi singing, which was req . 1 tiered with a heartiness that showed the , good spirit of the meeting. These gatber - ings occur twluo a year throughout the northern bounds of the New Castle Prcsby s i tery. The next meeting will be held in r June, at the White Clay Creek Church, Delaware. W.

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. ■ President Grant sent his seventh annua ! Message to Congress on Tuesday last. Fo '• | t!ie following summary of the documen we are indebted to the Baltimore American y'• President Grant’s message of this year h y 1 the longest he has ever transmitted to Con a i gress, although it is brief in comparisor with the ponderous productions of Mr. Johnson. The first moiety of it is devotee ' | to a sweeping review of the material inter a ests of the nation during the century of in f dependence now nearly completed. Itight C at the outset the President touches upon ar allied group of questions that a great many | people are thinking of as very nearly relat j ed to the sources of national prosperity , and the perpetuity of Republican institu -1 tious—the diffusion of free education, the 3 | guarding of the public schools from sceta i I rianism, and the taxation of church pro -1 perty. While politicians whose interests run in the opposite direction will say that President Grant is, in this portion of hia ! message, bidding for a renomiiiation on a i | class policy, the majority of the American r | people will recognise that ho has uttered | words of wisdom at a time when they are j greatly needed, lie urges the value of edit I cation, and recommends a constitutional , amendment making it the duty of all the States “to establish and forever maintain | free public schools adequate to the educa tion of all the children in the rudimentary ; branches—within their respective limits, irrespective of color, sex, birthplace or re , ligiun—forbidding the teaching in said ' schools of religious, atheistic or pagan ' tenets, and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by legislative, municipal or other authority, for the benefit or in aid, directly or indirectly, of any religions sect or denomination, or aid, or for the benefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatever.” The adoption of such an amendment would simply make written law of what has long been a fundamental principle of our institutions—the entire in dependence of the Slate in the public school system—and remove from politics what threatens to be a troublesome and vexatious issue, already agitated in certaiu quarters. From this point the message passes on to another cognate with it, and the President’s views in regard to it are that church pro perty should be made to bear a. share of taxation, exempting only cemeteries church edifices, the latter under restrictions, tne nature of which he does not indicate. Touching oar foreign relations the Presi dent announces that they are satisfactory with all the nations of the world, Spain excepted, and he proceeds to devote a con siderable portion of his message to the Cuban question. lie criticises the inhuman conduct of the war on the island, the fail ure of the Spanish Government to suppress the insurrection now seven yeais old, and the increasing duty of the nations affected, of which the United States is the chief, to make some movement in the direction of interposition. So far as the recognition of the independence of Cuba is concerned the President is decidedly opposed to it, for the reason that the insurgents have not as yet set up and maintained such a well estab lished Government as may properly be ranked as entitling it to a place among the Powers of the world. IJut while he de precates any interference in either way mentioned, he strongly urges that some sort of mediation by the United States alone, or in conjunction with other nations, is inevitable, because Spain can neither conquer the insurgents nor the hitter gain entire possession of Cuba. There are ne gotiations now in progress between the Madrid Government and Minister Cushing, which, while primarily looking only to se curing the rights of citizens of this coun try involved in the Cuban difficulty, may lead to mediation, as the President inti mates somewhat mysteriously. If that re sult is not reached through present negotia tions ho promises to again communicate with Congress on the subject. The whole tone of the message in connection with Spanish affairs is very different to what the alarming rumors of the past month have given reason to expect. Recommendations of the Secretary of War concerning the minutes of army ad ministration, among which are included permanent organization of the Signal Ser vice and a careful fostering of the torpedo system, are endorsed by the President, and he summarizes the condition of the navy as being excellent so far as its strength permits. Fifteen single-turretcd monitors are ready for sea, and the five double-tur reted vessels of the same class are being put in condition. We have forty wooden cruisers ready for work, the whole effective Meet numbering more than fifty vessels, j As the President remarks, our navy doss not make much of a show in comparison ! with those of other nations, but he further j comments that “neither our continental i situation nor our foreign policy ” requires ! that we should have the naval force of the j European Powers. I The Centennial receives a favorable men j tion, and a suggestion that the exhibition j project merits an appropriation from Con gress. The troubles on the Rio Grande arc no ticed and commended to the attention of Congress, the military force at the disposal of the Government being inadequate to check the incursions of Mexican raiders into Texas. The President asks Congress to take no tice of the manner in which our uaturaliza i tion laws are availed of by foreigners who | live long enough in this country to be nat uralized, then return home, and by plead ing American citizenship avoid all duties to their native country, and escape all ! duties to their adopted country by their : residence abroad, thus making fraudulent I use of the privileges of American citizen j ship. Such oases'are of very common oc currence, and reflect very severely upon this Government, while it has no practica ble remedy to apply. Congress should de terraine by law how expatriation may be accomplished and change of citizenship be established, so that cases of infringement can be punished, and the Government be enabled to properly deal with them. The message contains no uncertain utter ance on the financial question. Specie re sumption at the earliest day possible, the adoption of such legislation as will aid the act of the last Congress providing for specie payments in 1870, and setting an earlier date if possible, are the burden of this por tion of the document. “ Nothing,” says the President, “seems to me more certain than that a full, healthy and permanent re action cannot take place in favor of the in dustries and financial welfare of the coun try, until we return to a measffre of values recognized throughout the civilized world.” While the President is not confident of his own wisdom in laying down a policy to reach such an end, he makes a few sngges lions that seem to him sound and praclica hie. He would have a repeal of so much of the Legal-Tcuder act as makes the greenbacks receivable for debt, fixing a date to which the people might work up, his idea being that the Ist of Jauqary, 1877, would be a good time foy this demon etizing of fjip jegai-tendeva. Then he woula hare these nates redeemed at the rate of two. millions monthly in a bond running a long number of years and bear ing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent. Then the Secretary of the Treasury should be authorized to curtail expenses or increase the revenue. For the latter pqrpqso the re-enactment of fhe import duties on tea and coaee is recommended, aud the Presi dent makes a diversion which will please the Free-Traders in suggesting that duties on articles entering into home manufacture he remitted, as not paying for the cost of collection aud being at ouco a burden to consumers and a protection to manufac turers least entitled toil. Under the work ings of these revenue and financial meas ures the President iplimatos that the bur den oy debt can be reduced, the income of the Treasury increased and specie pay ments realized without any considerable embarrassment to the people. Barring brief mention of the Department reports, the above are the principal topics of importance the President touches upon. Legislation to reach the scandalous condi tion of affairs in ('tali, prohibit polygamy, and prevent the importation of Chinese women for infamous purposes, is urged upon Congress. While the President hue nothing to say directly on the third-term matter, his use of the language that “as this will he Hie last message which I shall have the honor of transmitting to Congress before my suc cessor is chosen,” may be taken as an indi cation that ho meant to indicate his expec tatiou of retiring ‘u pijyate life without saying so to exact words. The message is a clear, concise and readable document, and will he generally sittisfaetory. Thu President comUKiea by crystallizing bis views line the following recommendations to Congress, which he thinks should lake shape in the enactment of law : First. That the States shall ho ie,.uircd to afford the opportunity o,f a, gooff com mon school education to every child within uielr limits. Second. No sectarian teuetashall over be taught in any Softool supported in whole or lit part by the State, nation, or by the pro needs of any tax levied up"n any commu nity.
