" After r stormy prelude, the Radical cioud discharged its burden last night, and it will .bB,een that John Ioague is the partj .nominee for ruayor of Mem' phis. The nomination!1 of this gentle man hafheen confidently claimed by his political menaa ior someume-past. He is the choice of hia party, and it w not for us to praise or blame their selection- But, we may say -without offensef $it the Radicals might have " . ...... done worse; re Know not mat tney could have done better, although it seems strange to us that they suould&turow overboard their 'old veterans who stood by the party in the dark .night iof gloom when it cost 8omethlngtto bew Radical, and when John Ioaguo was playing between both parties, and occasionally recognized as a quasi Democrat. As a, man we have nothing to object to John Loague save his jiarty politics and his consenting to beoonietlie party-tool in an election which should be lifted out of the mire of party "politics and conducted upon the single issue-the pros jwnty ,ofi ."iTemphis. The Radicals having made, their party nominations lasfenlghqrmanicipal officers, the can- vasa oommeace3jhi3mbniing in good earnes rorrQsB3 to be characterized by great bitterness and personal asperi ty; but in entering upon the discharge of the duties i we are expected to perform, we would say, in the outset, that this contest is one that rises high above per sonal considerations, and while the Ap peal will boldly, earnestly and fearless ly support the people's nominees, in the interest of. All e public good, its columns will nlfc' tie prostituted to that personal . -calumny and defama tion which so often disfigures con tests forthe. election of public officers. The publib!course of men belong to the community, and may be freely can vass ed, but when private reputation is assailed to destroy a candidate the can vass sinks an dignity, and partakes of all the littleness and baseness of a con test betvrejn bullies and roughs. One ot me sinef lunctions of the press is to Keratinize the character and fitness of . men who become candidates for high po sition, and to criticise them with what ever freedom the public interest may require; but the day has passed when an editor can be kept chained like a burly bull-dog, to be turned loose by his masters and retupon opposing candi dates atleasure. "Wefchall use noth ing but decent, legitimate material in the present'eauvass, and there is surely enough to'flefeat John League and to se cure the election of Major J. J. Busby. If there-were no other, the fact of Mr. LEue'sO being a partisan candi date in an election for an office which has nothing to do with politics, but much concerning the future welfare and prosperity of Memphif, .would be sufficient reason for opposing him. The people are heart eore of narrow, illiberal, unjust parti sanship which rewards its rings and managers 'at their expense. The ed itors of the Appeal have given the vigor Of their youth and the mature energies of their manhood to party. They sustained Democracy in the oblo quy that has so long flooded its name. They have labored, however humbly, still sincerely, unselfishly and earnestly, in season and out of season, to maintain its supremacy. They judged its errors generously, and answered Its call with pride. They were not of those who crowded jla temples in the day of its triumph; its honors and laurels were freely accorded to others. But they could ee no connection between De mocracy ,anl a Memphis mayor, and two years ago, in the interest of the peoplethey opposed a Democratic nom ination for mayor. Pour months ago we took tho.eame position, and, as an earnest of our sincerity, we publicly and privately expressed a readiness to support L M. Hill, "William B. Moore, or Hon; Henry G. Smith, express ing the hope that the people would unite on eith'er of these Republicans, and that they might be elected irrespective; of party. But Uie leaders of the Radical party were so esznr r, ppoils and plun der that they eoul. uot rise to a patri otic duty, and they have put forward a party candidate. But these demagogues will learn "by the result of the present contest that parties rise and fall with the ebbs and flows of public opinion, and that those who spurn party politics in an election like this, and look only .to-the material interest and prosperity of a people struggling to re cuperate their lost fortunes, will survive he wreck of every mere partisan structure, and the memory of the men who blindly cling to party for self- aggrandizement. Politics are contempt ible i n the present election. Poor Mem phis is struggling like a blind giant She Is--'just emerging from a terrible ordeal, andiinsher great woes she cries to her children for help. El in wood is billowed with the grsves of those swept away by .the scourge, while the neighboring hillside's and plains are rldgedwlth the tombs of 16ved ones, Memphis, amid, the dark shadows of almost universal gloom and bereave ment, has determined to make one more desperate effoftfor greatness and pros perity. Sheiatheialrestchiidof aproud commonwealth. She is the emporium I or Tennessee, and if true to herself, she will emerge from her late misfortunes, and ristgingw,eirorts and newiriumphs. With the view of taking.a new start in the race to greatness- and -prosperity, the people of Memphis met in mass-convention two weeks ago, and flouncing party prejudices, nominated Major J. J.

He was faithful and' heroic in the sore trials which afflicted our city. His tireless la bor and beneficence made many a sad heart lisp his name with praise in the midst of great woes. In a word, J.

Pettigrew, Esc, President Chamber ui tummerce: Dkak Stit The undersigned, from the com mittee of the board of oCIcers of the diam ine of commerce, desire to report, through you. to that honorable body, that on Satur day last the board met in conference a com Tritttee of five members of the cotton-ex change, to-lnvite our co-operation In laborl ng. for the commercial welfare of the city, and to ascertain our views upon the question of a joint occupation by both organizations of the rooms recently beleeted by the exchange, and a division ot the duties and expenses of the secretary, of rents, etc. The looms In ques tion are centrally located, at the corner of Front and Madison streets, first floor. It Is proposed, at ail times, to keep the records and statistics ol the two organizations entirely separate and distinct, while the arrangement will be such that on all occasions of general meetings of the chamber the two rooms can be thrown Into one, and thus afford ample pace for the accommodation of the mem bers. By this arrangement an excellent loca tion Is secured, convenient for the attend ance of all the members; the chamber and exchange can ooth avail themselves ol the same persons as secretary and assistant, and, by an equitable dl-isjon of the salaries and rent, accomplish that which, at this time, Is especially desirable a very decided reduction in the annual expenses of the chamber. These being the unanimous views of your board, as also of the other gentlemen of the committee, it has been thought proper to re commend to the chamber of commerce the ratification of the following arrangement looking to an economical and efficient man agement of the chamber: The chamber ot commerce to assume, of the obligations of the cotton-exchange Proportion of rent - $ 600 00 Proportion of secretary's salary 150 00 Proportion of assistant's salary . 400 00 Proportion of porter's wages. 100 (X) i ,S2 oo Expense of luel and lights to be divided by the secretary. At present the annual expenses of the chamber are about lour thousand live hun dred dollars. Under the proposed arrange ment they will not probably exceed two thousand five hundred dollars. We are of opinion that, while the chamber will thus save fully two thousand dollars a year, its efficiency will at the same time be materially enhanced. Respectfully, I). T.

Colonel Trousdale expressed liU thanks for this manifestation of kindness, and said, while ho was not a merchant, still he always had the Interest ofMnerohants and Of Uie chamber of commerce atjiearj. Hettierefore wanted to become a regular member: , On a motion to amend, he was elected a member without dues. The president then made few remarks of an encouraging character exhorting every merchant tojoln the chamber of commerce and the cotton exchange. He also stated that the chamber of commerce was now In a pros perous condiUon. The proposlUon of Mr. Hunt to release the chamber of commerce trom lis liabilities In regard to the rent of the hall lor 1874, upon the condition of paying him three hundred and sixty dollars, was accepted.

Sykes" Is a contestant for me seat now occupieu oy spencer. Senator Wrieht called up the bill introduced by him on Monday last to repeal the act of March 3, 1S73, Increasing certain salaries therein nameU, and addressed the senate at length In favor of them. He said: What the country wants is men who are not for sale- men wno are souna rrom center to circum ference, who have courage without whistling to bring it, who eat what they have earned and wear what they have paid for. With such men. lil?h or low sales will make little differ ence. He favoied a liberal consideration, but thought the amount allowed before the in crease was sufficient, and it was best now to fix the salaries. They had better retrace their steps at the earliest practicable moment. It was the easiest way to rectify an unpardona ble blunder. He denounced the manner In which the salaries were Increased as most vi cious and defenseless: It was tacked on to the appropriation bill, where the executive could not veto It without stopping the wheels of government. He had no doubt but that this was the cause of the recommendation or the President in his late message that he be allowed, at the close of the session, oue portion of the bill without defeating the whole of It. In conclusion, he called upon the irreat Reoublican party to retrace Its steps on the salary bill, and satlsry the people that the partv was true to Its promises. No party, In so few years, had made such a grand record, and it could well anu consistently auuru 10 retrace Its stens. He desired thatnvenues of trade be opened by having cheaper transportation to the products ol the great west, and the people should have au abundance of currency to meet the demands of business. He moved that the bill be referred to the committee on civil service and retrenchment, and it was so ordered. The senate went Into executive session, and soon after adjourned. 

HOUSE. The house proceeded to the first business in order Monday 'seal! of Uie States for bills of reference only. Under the call large num bers of public ana privau- oius were intro duced and referred. Mr. Nezlev Introduced a bill modifying tne steamboat passenger act, by aUowing tow boati on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to carry one hundred and fifty pounds of steara prexsnre, instead of one hundred and ten pounds, with standard boilers of forty-two Inches diameter and plates a quarter of an Inch In thickness. He explained the bill, andftated that It did not change the existing law, but only extended It, as the law would expire by limitation very soon. The bill was passed. Mr. Maynard, from the committee on rules, reported a bill remanding all disabilities im posed remaining on any person by the third secUon of tho fourteenth article of amend ments to the constitution, ana sunsutuung for It tne ironciaa oatn moaineu, as now ad ministered to persons from whom disabilities had been removed. After discussion, the bill passed, by a vote of one hundred and forty five to twenty-nine. Mr. Hale Me.J, from the select committee on thesalary quesUon, reported a bill repeal ing so much oi the salary bill as Increases the compensaUon of the Vlce-Presldent,speaker, senators, representatives and delegates to con gress. The second section revives, and de clares to be In full force, all acts relaUng to Uie pay and allowance of senators and mem bers that were repealed or superceded by the act of the third of March, 1873, provided they shall receive no mileage for coming to and from the present session, except their actual Indi vidual traveling expenses by Uie most direct route of usual travel. The third section re quires the secretary of Uie treasury to cover into the treasury all sums that may remain undrawn, or that have been re ceived as Increased compensation, and which shall have or may come into his possession by the return Uicreof. Mr. Kasson. trom the minority of the com mittee, submitted a report, which was signed by himself and Mr. Jewett. They declared themselves dissaUstled with the bill reported by the majority, and stated their reasons therefor as being, first, that the emphatic and oonUnned expression of Uie great major ity of Uie American people. In all forms that should influence their Judgment, against the increase of salaries should take the question of its repeal out of the field of debate; second, that the depressed financial con diUon of the country requires economy In disbursements from the pnhllc treasury, and specially In respect to those of which members are themselves beneficiaries. Ho fmbllc act would go further than this to estab lsh the confidence of the people In their representaUves: third, that the popular dis satisfaction with the salary bill was chiefly directed toward the law-makers who in creased their own emoluments. The Presi dent, however, was part of the national legis lative authority, and to that officer had been assigned much the largest increase of salary. The salary could not lawfully be diminished during the current term, bnt It could be reduced from tne close thereof. The minority, however, deem It necessary to reduce Uie incidental allowances of the President's office, so far as compatible, with the care and safety of Uie publ.c property. They recom mend that all compensations Increased by the act of the third of March, 1S73, be re established at their former rates, subject to constitutional exception, excepUng also the franking privilege. The blU accompanying the report makes provisions to carry out these Mr. Maynard gave notice of an amendment to suspend the salary bill during the forty third congress ln-ead of repealing It. Mr. Poland gave noUce of a substitute, which, he thought, would meet the popular demand. Laugh wr.l The subsUtute was read. It repeals so much of the salary act as increased the pay of senators and representa tives, and fixes It at what It was Immediately prior to that act. It requires that all moieties paid to senators and representatives of the forty-third congress, under the provisions of that act, whether for tne forty-second or forty-third congress, shall be charged and reckoned as part payment of their compensa tion as memoers ot Uie forty-third congress. It requires Uie treasurer of the United btates to mall to each member of Uie forty-second congress, who Is not a member of the forty third, and who received addlUonal compensa tion, a notl -e Informing 1dm of the repeal of the law, and request him to pay the dlfierence paid and received by him Into the treasury. Mr.Miblack said that, as a member of the committee, he agreed to most of the proposi tions submitted by Uie minority, but dissent ed from some of them. In the course of a protracted discussion as tofne disposition to bo made of tho bill, Mr. Uartleld recommended Mr. Halo to move the Jrevlou question, and pass the bill at once, le recalled a long ducusslon which took place some years ago, on a like subject, to the exclusion ol other public business, and sug gested that the house was prepared to vote at once on Uie simple repeal of adtcreaseof Uie salary law. Mr. Kelly asked Mr. Hale whether his bill took effect from Uie first day of the present congress. Mr. Hale replied that it did not. Mr. Kelley argued tbat It ought to, and the passage of a bill which did not do so would place the house la a wuise iiosiUob before the American people than anv leiruintinn ihih jfet had been hd.

APPROPRIATION WANTED. Washington. December 8, The secretary of the naw sent the following letter to the speaker of the house of representaUves,whlch has been referred to the committee on appro priations: Under the circumstances of the present emergency, I am compelled to ask that a special appropriation be mado to cover the expenses of putting the ironclad and cruise navy of the United States in a condiUon for immeoiate anu ncuve service, i nave ta&en measures to nut everv available Ironclad and wood ship of onr navy In a condiUon for Im mediate duty. I have ordered all ships of Uie various squadrons within reach to rendezvous aiJvey west. I amemisuor; men to supply and fill up all the crews Ij8'ial our vessels. I have accumulated materials, provisions and snpplles for their maintenance and support, and advanced ammunition and all weapons oi naval wariare ior ineir use. ine circum stances which have constrained the depart ment to this unusual activity ana consequent xpendlture are known to you ana to the whole country. The lact that they were incurred during a recef-s of congress made It necessary mat i snoiuu myseii assumt tne responsibility of prompt action, relying upon the wisdom and Justice ot the people and their rem-esentaUves for support. I have not as yet exceeded the appropriations for the current year; but these measures, with the cost of preparing, transporting and concen trating everything neceswiay to carry them out, iiave already almost exhausted Uie mouey for working Uie bureaus of the depart ment, anu mis inusb ue suppueu ut uuce 11 work Is to en on. The cost of luittlnz our Ironclads In service a work already under taken, and In some Instances tar ad vanced will also require a large aoproprlatlon from the country's revenues. The amount required to reimburse the bu reaus so as to carry them through this year, and also to put all of our available monitors In order, will not be less than four millions of dollars. If our .force Is to be increased, or It the powerful double-turreted monitors Mian tonomah, Monadnock and Puritan are to be put Into condition for usefulness, at least one million more will be required. The secretary had a lone conference with the committee on appropriations to-day, and will have another to-morrow. 

TEMPER OF THE HABANEUOS. Havana. December 8. Captain-General Jouvellar authorizes tbe statement that the enUre island Is tranquil. He has no donbt but that all will be arranged peacefully and satisfactorily without the slightest difficulty. He now declares that he does not Intend to leave Havana or transfer his power Into the hands of General Merelo. The Segundo Cabo who arrived by the last steamer irom Spain, says tbe feeling of the people In Havana is quiet and no disturbance is apprehended, the dlsposlUon to comply with the demands of Uie home government and obllgaUons of treaty witn the United states without further discussion is becoming general. The general com manding at SanUago de Cuba, In Uie absence of Generic Burriel, acting without orders. placed a number or tne virgimus prisoners aboard the Spanish man-of-war Bozaln.and sent tbem to Cienfuegos. The few remaining Srlsoncrs were either too 111 to be removed, or, elng youths of tender age, have been set at liberty. The prisoners, while at Santiago, were well treated by the authorities, and were In no way molested by the people.

ABOUT SICKLES'S RESIGNATION. -VASHisaroN, December & There is a re luctance in official quarters to talk about the anUclpatedor actual resignation of Minister Sickles, pending the protocol. There Is no doubt that It was owing to the unsatisfactory conduct of Mr. Sickles that the negotiations were consummated at Washington between Secretary Fish and Admiral Palo. General Sickles being a reUred officer, with an annual salary of five thousand six hundred and eighty-five dollars, was at liberty to go where be pleased, and In accepting the office of minister to Spain, In May, ISO), he has drawn the actual salary of twelve thousand dollars for this service, bnt nothing on army ac count. A law prohibits the drawing of more than his salary. On his retirement as minis ter he wUl draw his army pay. ARRIVAL OF THE KANSAS AT SANTI AGO. Santiago be Cuba, December 30. The United States steamer Kansas arrived here, yesterday, ater a bard passage, was driven out of her course and finally compelled to put Into Bermuda for coal. The commanders of Uie Kansas and Juniata have not yet made an formal demand for the delivery of the Virginlus's pilsoners. The latter were re moved from the Jail to Morsefont this morn ing. The French war steamer Kensalnt and the frigate sloop-of-war Niobe are in the har bor. A FAST CUBAN STEAMER ATTEMPT TO BURN THE VIRGINIUS. New York, December 7. The steamer City of Madeira, tbe fastest vessel on the coast, Is to be altered into a gunboat and transport, to be used In case of war. A Herald's Havana special says: "The American consulate Is quietly guarded by troops. An attempt was made Thursday night to burn the Vtrginins. Regular sol diers have been sent on board to protect her. LATEST IMPRESSIONS IX WASHINGTON. Washington, December 8. The protocol signed by Admiral Polo with Secretary Fish on the twenty-ninth of November, was with the lull approbation of his government after ma ture consideration . of all Its consequences, and since that time It has expressed no inclination whatever for exchange of its terms. The excitement in the Island of Cuba and the alleged threats concerning the Virginias gave reasonable fonndaUon for fear on tho part of many per sons that Uie vessel and the surviving passen gers and crew would not be promptly deliver ed to the United States authorities, according to the terms of agreement. But such appre hensions have not been shared by the execu tive branch of our government; for It can be positively stated that there Is nothing to di minish Its confidence In the sincerity of purpose of the Spanish government on Its ability to execnte Its en gagement". The delay of transferring has been unavoidable, and only recently the ar rangement for the consummation of the terms have been completed. Whatever may have been suggested heretofore as to the programme, It can now be asserted that tbe Virginias wilt be delivered to one of our naval ves sels within the next ten days, at a Cuban port, in open day, and the surviving passengers and crow" will be transferred to a United States ship at SanUago de -Cuba In an equally open manner. The vessels to perform these servl -es will soon be. If they have not already been, designated by the secretary of the navy. This is tho condi tion of affair to-night, which has served to Inspire a hope of continued peace with, Spain, in order that the United States may conUnne to give their material support to the Castelar govern ment In 1U efforts to establish a republic Gen eral Polo has lately received a communica tion from Captain-General Jouvellar, In whlrh there Li no reference to the subject of his alleged resignation.

THE LAST OP CICAILA. 'Ji - His Petition for Mandamns Against the City Council Dismissed hj Judge linker, of tbe Second CircnitCoarfi f Mcssrsi Tread well and Pettigrew are De Facto Oflicers, and Cicalla Mast IlaTe'OthenEemedy than"- Mandamus.? - - " : Alt , , JndseiHalsev. of the second circuit court. yesterday delivered his opinion on the demur rer in uie case oi i aui a. wacaua r. uie uuani or aldermen or- the-city- of'Mempcis, wmcn was filed on a petition for a writ of mandamut nisi to reinstate mm as aiaerman, ne .iiaving been expelled from this office by action of the board of aldermen. To ' this City Attorney Randolph filed a demurrer on Uie grounds: First, that the petitioner has been expelled ana nis successor eieraeaoy tnowjwuvuicu board, bv law. Is tho Jndse of tbe nualificatlon of members; second, that Uie second circuit court has no Jurisdiction to revise th: action of the board, and certainly not by avnaiKla- Tne conrt held that the at legation' of fact in tho first de murrer 4s true. The petition shows that me reiaier nas oeen expeueu ior cause ueem ed suClclent, and tbe board of aldermen has appointed a successor. The question as to the legal proposlUon, "That as tue said board Is made, by law, the judge of the qualifications of Its members, and has power to expel a member 0 that he (the relater) is not entitled, while the order of expulsion re nalna In force, to the seat he -seeks to be re turned to," Is correct. " Because this is trne, by virtue- of the cliar ter, does It fellow, as a necessary 'egal conse quent), that while such order-remains in lorce, he may not be entitled to be returned to his seat? Buttheclty charter uiakes the city legisla ture the Judge of t ,e qualifications of its members. It tails to imiRe them tho exclusive judger? While It was competent for Uie legis lature to vest wis junsaicuoujiiaoes uuiuu to. (Seesectlon, city charter Judge Dillon's comments upon "Municipal .Corporations," sections HI and 142), and holds i "What .effect do provisions of this kind have upon theju risdlcUonof the superior courtT The answer must depend upon the language In which these provisions are couched in the light of the eeneral laws of the State nnon.the sub ject of contested elecUon sand guo-trarranxj." in tne absence oi uneipuvoeai ctnainiy inai the legislature Intended to divest this power, the jurisdiction or the court remains. Such language as quoted has the effect, ordinarily, to afford a cumulative or primary tribunal, not an exclusive one. One clause of a muni cipal charter that "Uie city council shall be ihejudges of the elections, returns and quail-, ficattons of their own members, and of the other officers of the eorpi raUon," was held' by the supreme court of Delaware not to "oust" Uie superior court of the State (Invested with the usual powers or the king's bench) of Its superintending Jurisdiction over corpora tions. In Uie face of an error as to want of qualification of a member by tbe council a mandamus might Issue. The section or our city clntrter confers no such exeiiaire juris diction, and does not take away the jurisdic tion oi tne circurt court. The section of the cltjc charter referred to In tbenlst ground of the'demurrerhas refer ence to tne admission and not to Uie expul sion of members. Even giving the section toe full force claimed. It does not divest the circuit court of lis superintending power. "Does it follow because the relator has been removed he Is, therelore, not entitled to his seat? " "where a municipal ofllcer.or a member or a municipal corporation has been illegally suspended or Illegally removed, he Is in gener al entitled to a mandamus to restore him." (Tide Dillon t-i. Municipal corporation, sec tion 6SS.) But mandamus will not lie where there is another plain and adequate remedy. Idem, GSti.) All aumonues recognize lao ngm oi an ex Delled member to seek redress, and also es tablish tbe jurisdiction of Uie circuit court over the acts of municipal corporations, not otherwise divested by statute. Therefore, this ground of this demurrer cannot be sus tained. ' As if the Question of Uie remedy being by mandamus, tbe provision of the Kngllsh law, and generally adopted In this country, Is, that an-Information, In the natnre of a quo warranto, Is the proper reme dy fortrylne or testing the validity of an offi cer's election or commission, etc While cer tificate Of election is prima Jacte eviaence in favor of an officer, and in everv nroceedimr. except a direct one to to' the title of such holder, it is conclusive; but In quo warranto the court goes behind the certificate or com mission, and inquires Into Uie validity of tne election or appointment, and decides the legal rights, upon full investigation. (1'itle Dillon im. Municipal Corporations.) Mr. Moses, in quoting from Judge Dillon (p.p. 151 and 132), lays duwn the principle, and the only case clLed bvblm In favor of the Dosltlon. Is Rex t-. Uie Corporation of Bedford, decided In 1805, and reported in GFat 3b0. The quesUon did not directly arise In tbe above case, and lha broadest Intimation to be found In support or the proposition that "mandamuses In aid of proceedings In quo warranto, will lie where there Is an adverse holding of the office under color of right before the ruljudlcatlon In quo warranto,'Tls In tbe reputed utterance of Law rence, J., which, being a mere dictum, Is entl Ued to authority. (Vide Dillon, sections 678 and 679, municipal corporations.) mandamus lies to compel admittance to a councilman elected, but not to try the right to a public office, especially where held by ad verse claimant, ine remeay, m ucvuruauce with the Kngllsh rule, hr Information, in tne natnre of a quo warranto, Is according to section 6S0 of the same author. Is held In Georgia and some other States to be proper where a person Is an officer de facto. The erounds of tbe case are stated In Uitrd Johns eases 7!) and 0, that " where' the office is atreaay nueu ny a person wno nas oeen au ral tied and sworn, and Is In by color of risht. a mandamus is never Issued to admit another person because the corporation belnir a. third party may admit or not at pleasure, and the rights of the party in office may be Injured without his having an opportunity to make defense. The proper remedy is In the first Instance by Information In Uie nature of a quo warranto by which Uie rights of the par lies may De tneo." It being admitted In tne petition that Petti grew and Trcadwell have been elected, wheth er properly or not, by the board or aldermen, and the role having been ascertained that If they are in "by color of right," mandamus does not lie. It remains to consider whether such an elecUon constitutes "color of right" to the offices in question; or, In other words, wheth er PetUgrew and Treadwell are officers de facto. isuuer, cmei-jusuce in tne supreme court, oi errors. Connecticut, says an officer de Jacto is one whce acts, though not those ot a lawful officer, tbe law, upon principles of policy and Justice, will hold valla solar as they Involve the Interest of tne public and third persons where tbe duties of Uie office were exercised. It has been held In Ten nessee that although a Judge may not be con- stitnuoniuiy engioie, yet, 11 ne ne commis sioned, his official acts are valid and binding as an officer de facto. Judge 'Halsey says that there can be no doubt but Messrs. Treadwell and PetUgrew are officers de facto under color of right, and such being tbe case. 'If Uie views already ex. Dressed Ira correct. Uie proner remedy Is by some other than mandamus. It is unneces sary, as it would be Improper, to express here any opinion opon the facts set np In the peti tion. No question of the kind now arises. I have simply endeavored to ascertain and ap ply the legal principle involved in this con troversy, In the attitude In which it has pre sented ltaelf to the court. The result Is that the second ground of demurrer, must, be .sus tained. MARRIED.- GREENE BROOKS In this city, on the 7th InsU, by Rev. Dr. Landrum, Mr. M. J.
