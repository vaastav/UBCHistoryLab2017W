Tt,j ad ?soond-oiasa matter. [ SUNDAY. DECEMBER IS, 190R. CONGRESS NOT BLAMELESS. Says the Baltimore Sun: "Referring to the law which nadl been enacted to restrain and restrict | the use of [he President's detective force, known as the secret service, the President, in his message which I la.addressed to Congress, used thisj language: " 'In Rs present form the restric? tion operates only to the advantage | of the criminal, or the wrongdoer. The chief argument In favor of the pro-| viaion was that the Congressmen dldj not themselves wish to be Investigat? ed by secret service men.' "If a more insulting form of words ' coald have been devised for use in a I message to Congreas. we are ignorant j as to how it could be done. The plain and unvarnished meaning of the President's words seems to be that there are criminals In Congress that the chief reason ior the enactment of the law waa for the protection of i criminal congressmen, and that Con? gress as a whole was influenced -y| this arrengement to protect crime. Itl Is expected that the House of Repre acatatlrea and the Senate will take] appropriate action for their own vindi? cation from thla aspersion."?Haiti more Sun. That the Preaident's words were] abrupt and harsh no one will deny. Nobody believes that a majority of' congressmen and senators are corrupt. Ttjat some members of both bodies are "crooked" In their own Interests, and that others are disposed to de-' port from the straight and narrow' path in behalf of Influential friends] and supporters outside of the legisla? tiv? chamber, everybody believes. "The Dally Press frequently has felt j coiled upon to criticise and denounce) reap? of Mr. Roosevelt's acta. Inj vejy few instances has It been the' Ptwatdent s defender. I But even the devil Is entltiej to! whmt is cemtng to htm. { Granting that the President s vigo? rous words in reproof of congressmen j not justified, it must be admit? ted that the provocation was strong. The secret service men loaned by the treasury department to the de partment of justice ferreted out colossal public lsnd frauds in the Far West. They produced testimony which convicted a United States sena? tor and a member of the House o( Representatives from the State of Oregon Others, not in public life. | hot closely allied with Federal legis latcrs also were prosecuted upon evi? dence adduced by the secret aervlee; agents In each instance, trial was by Jury made up of cltisens of a Kate wherein the accused exerclaed j powerful political and financial a> Tl?rre never was any imputation o: aadee bias on -be jar of either judge ?T Jwry ! By these proceedings, millions oi ?eres of public lanu. were reotorej *? the United States government a."ier Paving been obtained through fraudu ana*, practices on the part of great load compacte? by and with the std sand collusion of at hast one UaANM senator and one ssember o{ Itssansl Ho-jse of Represen-a Two United States court jur ass so decided Pwrtliod by power and Influence one hot incorruptible secret em could ever hove heea ?V P?a to reach the oaVootrs iu what lacy considered their Impreg nable strong bo id Senator MI'chell araa sentenced to the penitentiary The. verdict was denounced upon the floor of the Unit? ed States Senate. Furthermore, it U on record |n the public prims (tiat only the threat by a Texas senator that he would make objection, thereby creating a painful situation, prevented the United States Senate from pass log resolution,; of respect upon the death of the convicted senator, and appointing a committee of his collea? gues to attend the funeral. Then for Congress to follow with] a resolution restricting the employ? ment of secret service men for th?| reclamation (>* stolen government pro. perty at least bad a sinister look. Whether or not Congress shall cen? sure the President by resolution its] not Important. Itut if tbe legisla? tive department of tbe government should allow tbe present session to] expire wlihoui rescinding Us former action concerning the transfer of thej secret service agents, few will bellev? {that Mr. Roosevelt went far enough j j in his denunciation. 

LET'S KEEP OUR MONEY AT j HOME. It ought not lo be, and The Dally Press does not think il is necessary to exhort the people of this eity to ?iblnk first and always of the upbuild? ing and continued prosperity of honiel enterprises In the matter of making| their before-Chrlatmna purchases. I The ease of access to and the gla? mor of two large cities in close proxi? mity to Newport News may'hold out attractions to (lie unthinking Hut there is no want which may not be supplied just us satisfactorily aud just as cheaply In Newport News as elsewhere in this or any other sec? tion. No belter stocked or equipped mercantile establishments are lo be found anywhere. Our merchants have studied the requirements and wishes of their patrons and have ex? ercised the utmust endeavor to pro? vide for every possible want. It would be a shameful disregard of local pride and patriotism at this time lo divert from home channels any amount of money, however small, which might, with equal or better re-| turns .be employed In Newport News. STANDPATTERS EMBARRASSED. The path of tbe House ways and I means conimltteeraan, like that of] other transgressors, is growing bard. Heretofore this assemblage of alleged | tariff revisionists has suffered moat j merciless assaulta from the anti standpatters. Now the powerful forces j in the rear which have been cheer? ing them on threaten to subject Mr. Cannon's cohorts to a cross-tire. Professing an affectionate solicitude for home industries, the Republican protectionists have thus furnished and equipped the rooms in the House of? fice building: The handsomely carved woodwork behind which tht ways and means committee alts, was imported from Italy: the gypsum in the walls came from Canada; the towels from Eng? land; tbe chairs from Vienna, and toe carpets ,'rom Belgium.
