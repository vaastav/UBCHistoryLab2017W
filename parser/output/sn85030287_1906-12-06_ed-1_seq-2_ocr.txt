WEADE COUNfY NEWS. 3ohit O. Wehrle, Publisher: MEADE, KANSAS. The greatest successes are often founded on failure. A lie Is the acute form and hypoc risy the chronic form of the same dis ease. Some preachers make the Scripture read: "Make your calling and collec tion Bure." A man may not acquire wealth by early rising, but he can give a good Imitation of industry by so doing.

In the controversies of the future? it will be well for the powers to remem ber that the steel for the Italian war ships was furnished by an American Institution. The Japanese roll of honor contains the names of 56.426 fighters who won distinction in the war with Russia. With half a million heroes on hand It's no wonder that Japan isn't afraid to talk back to Uncle Sam. Italians have erected In New York city a monument to Verdi, the grand old man of Italian music.

The English can't be accused of dumping when they can sell us one of the only two copies of the 62-leaved 1631 edition of "The Passionate Pil grim" for 110,000.

When the Japs calmly examine the huge national debt they have contracted during the last three years, they will feel inclined to talk over in a friendly spirit any differ ences that may arise with a stronger power than Russia. Every day or so the "largest ship in the world" is launched. The latest monster to be heralded as the largest Is the Cunard liner Mauretania, which is larger by a thousand tons than its sister ship Lusitanla, which was launched In June. But the dimensions of these ships are the same; 790 feet long and 88 feet beam. The story of a Japanese spy sketch ing fortifications at Manila has a sen sational sound, but its authenticity may be doubted. It is pretty evident that influences are at work trying to create distrust between Americans and Japanese. Both these peoples are too sensible and too confident In each other's good will to be easily misled. Doctor Forbes Wlnslow, an alienist, has been quoted as saying that before long there will be more lunatics in the world than sane people. He has been misquoted, of course. What he said was that if insanity continues to in crease at the rate shown by statistics the Insane will some time outnumber he sane. It all depends on the "If." We need not despair. The girls employed in a porcelain factory in New Jersey went out on strike the other day because the man ager ordered that they must no longer sing at their work. They had been In the habit of amusing themselves by singing popular songs, hymns and Sunday school music, but they may do that no more. Rather than keep silent they stopped work. It cannot be that the manager was married, else he would have known what result to expect from such an order. Japanese scholars are urging upon the people the importance of aban doning the old Chinese system of sign writing, or ideogpraphs, and the adop tion of the Roman alphabet for spell ing Japanese words, says the Youth's Companion.

Inasmuch as English is taught In the primary schools in Japan, the coming generation will know the alphabet anyway, whether they, use it in their own language or not. The British women suffragist's who created a riot in the lobby of the British house of commons set a bad example to the world. It is the be lief of many that the influence of women on public life would be puri fying and uplifting, but when a body of petitioners becomes so turbulent as to call for the Interference of the police and the imposition of fines for disorderly conduct, then lovely woman gets down to the level of the tyrant man, and, being on the level with him, cannot be his uplifter.

PRESIDENT'S E Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. ' INCOME -INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth of Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions. His Views on Negro Question Asks for Currency Reform, and Shipping Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs Many Other Important Subjects Discussed. Washington. Dec. 8. The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt's annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment into law of several bills introduced Into congress last winter and spring; his views on the negro problem; t he scor i ng he gi ves t h ose w hom he terms "preachers of discontent ;" the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the interstate commerce clause of the constitution, and his recommendation for an inheritance and income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the ones mentioned are by far of the greatest im;xrtance. He es pecially urges the passage of the bill prohibiting corporations from contribut ing to campaign funds, and also that one which would give the government the right of appeal in criminal cases. Of this he says: "Another bill which has just pact one house of the congress and which is ur gently necessary should be enacted into law Is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists In many of the states; It exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that In any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had Indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant's demurrer; while in another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it. and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be In real conflict with each other, but it Is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of Justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. 1 can not too strongly ur?e the passage of the bill In question. A failure to pass will result In seriously hampering the government In Its effort tr obtain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case were the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically in view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district Judge, against what may be the judgment of the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional." and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion." . Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of In junctions in labor disputes, he says: "In my last message 1 suggested the en actment of a law in connection with the issuance of Injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of injunctions In such cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, 1 believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. The Negro Problem. The negro problem Is given considera ble attention, after railing attention to the fact that no section of the country is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchings. and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Uov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fail to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder; assault with in tent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and 'provision shou'f be made by which the punishment .nay follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization: that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part In the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral deterioration In all the children who have any knowledge of it, and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. "Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be justice under the law. and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. Capital and Labor. On the subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preach hatred to the rich man. as such, . . . to seek to mislead and inflame to mad ness honest men whose lives are hard, and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to ap preciate the danger in the doctrines preached is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of Afr ican national life." Continuing on iis subject he says: "The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the ir-t damaging blow that can be given pop ular government is to elect an un worthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such case dem ocracy is itself on trial, popular self government under republican forms Is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man.whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and -unworthy de-nagog. promising much and performing nothing, or else TOO

The young men and the school teachers became acquaint 4 1B4 & fQU&f MftA 4ra4 uto- ANNUAL MESSAG performing5 nothing- but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corrupttonist, who, for his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of men of either of these two e lasses, we shall show ourselves false to America's past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand In hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law, or who seeks to main them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There Is nothing to choose between such a re actionary and such an agitator; funda mentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim Is fearlessly to do exact and even Justice to all." Railroad Employees Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight-hour day, but in sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, "just about as ab surd as it is. so far as the isthmus is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the work is done by alien black men or alien yellow men." He urges the enactment of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. .He reviews the work of the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory investiga tion of controversies between employers dnd employes when they arise' "In this age of great corporate and la- bor combinations, neither employers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party to a dis pute, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of securing recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public has itself an interest 'which cannot wisely be disregarded; an interest not merely of general conven- . fence, for the question of a Just and proper public policy must also be con sidered. In all legislation of this kind It is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual results; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for the decisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legal fashion, and yet would give a chance for public opin ion to exert its full force for the right." Control of Corporations. A considerable portion of the message is devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of inspection on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations by the federal government he says: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex perience has conclusively shown the im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corpora tionsa control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosures by each big corporation of Its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to puc a stop to the secur ing ol Inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. As a matter of fact it is these reactionaries and ultraconservatives who are them selves most potent in increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the agitation is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways is to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate com mon carriers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain in con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no system of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fail to put a premium upon individual initiative, individual capacity and effort; upon the energv, character and foresight which it is "so important to encourage In the individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect of pure socialism, and especially of its extreme form communism, and the dest iction of individual character which tluy would bring about, are In part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results in a single individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all others until his or its rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position of utter inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer in some way to his belief in the necessity for the curbing of enor mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both in come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should Impose a graduated Inheritance t x, and, if possi ble, a graduated income tax. He says: "I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful study in order that the people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds lust how far they are willing to go in the matter ; while only trained legislators can work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that in the near future our nation al legislators should enact a law provid ing for a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily Increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any individual or corporation. It may be well to make the tax heavy, in proportion as the individual benefited is remote of kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one individual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object should be to put a con stantly increasing burden on the inher itance of those swollen fortunes which It is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There can be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance should be received. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortunes in question It is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress In this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national Inheritance tax. while it might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. Agricultural Interests. He appeals for every encouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural interests of the country. He points to the good that is being done by the various forms of grange organiza tions, and says: "Several factors must cooperate in the Improvement of the farmer's condition. He must have the chance to be educated in the widest possible sense in the sense which keeps ever in view the intimate relationship between the theory of edu cation and the facts of life. In all education we should widen our aims. It is a good thing to produce a certain num ber of trained scholars and students; vitation to dinner, which was duly ac cepted. As both young ladies are passably good looking, the young men anticipated an agreeable evening. Hardly had the four seated themselves at the dinner table when the young ladies started a discussion of the poets. The discussion ranged' through the list from ancient to modern times, the young ladies doing all the talking, while the young men,' being out of their element, supplied an occasional monosyllable to the conversation, an! ill their Sorts to turn Mm ooa vena but the education superintended by ths state must seek rather to produce a bun dred good citizens than merely one scholar, and It must be turned now and then from the class book to the study of the great book of nature itself. This is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again and again by all observers most competent to pass prac tical judgment on the problems of our country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people and to confer more real significance upon the phrase "dignity of labor," and to pre pare the pupils so that In addition to each developing in the highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may together help create a right public opinion, and show In many ways social and cooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business world; and It has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. It Is no less neces sary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement is good in itself and is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It is kept to its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological. Marriage and Divorce. As' a means of bringing about national regulation of marriage and divorce he suggests a constitutional amendment, and says it Is not safe to leave these ques tions to be dealt with bv the various states. Continuing on this subject he says: When home ties are loosened; when men and women cease to regard a worthy family life, with all its duties fully performed, and all its responsi bilities lived up to, as the life best worth living: then evil days for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely It should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility Is, from the standpoint of the nation, from me standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death, race death; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which la the more dreadful exactly in propor tion as the men and women guilty thereof are In other respects, in char acrer, and bodily and mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes made happy by their presence. No man. no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other cause, and retain his or her self-respect. The president asks for the enactment Into law of a shipping bill that will place American interests on the seaa on a par with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication with South American ports. Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are inadequate because of the wide fluctuation of Interest charges, he says: "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and Interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially impair the value of the United States two percent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary of- the treasury, the es sential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be per mitted to issue 'a specified proportion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted In legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency pre sented by times of stringency. He again asks for free trade with this country for the Philippines and in the same connection reviews the work done by this country In the Islands, and says "If we have erred in the Philippines it has been in proceeding too rapidly in the direction of granting a large meas ure of self-government." Naturalization of Japs. President Roosevelt scores San Fran cisco and other Pacific coast cities for their treatment of the . Japanese, and makes the following recommendations: "I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provding for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our in ternational obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States gov ernment are entirely inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens in the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly rerommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and adied to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible In our international rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by the federal government toward this end. and in the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that it is in my power to do will be done, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. The city by itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and if inde pendent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the United States government. It Is un thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed it against the conse quences of their own wrongdoing." American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan In Porto Rico should be dredged and improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other insular possessions, should all be direct ed under one executive department; by preference the department of state or the department of war. Cuban Intervention. The rebellion in Cuba and the Inci dents leading up to the establishment of the provisional government Is reviewed, and the president says: "When the election has been held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the imperative need of pre serving justice and keeping order in the island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed In the island, it is ab solutely out of the question that the Island should continue independent; and the United States, which has assumes the sporsorship before the civilized world for Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed in such orderly fashion as to secure the safet of lite and property. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-government is always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the Cubans as thy tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started It shall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionary disturbances on the other." On the subject of the Panama canal he promises a special message in the near future. Considerable space Is devoted to the International conference of American re publics and the visit of Secretary Root to South America, and points to the fact that our efforts in behalf of the nations of that country are appreciated by them. tion to other channels proved fruit- 1 less. One of their friends, happening ! to see the party, says that the male members presented a heart-breaking picture of distress. A few hours la ter they were discovered at a conveni ent bar and it took a good many drinks to revive them. Since then they have bad many inquiries about poetry from sympathetic friends. - Getting the Limit ' The corruption ol the beet produce the varau LaUn Pravsrtk . "OUT there: IN
