You see we are going to be represented in the county central committee. Township committee organized by elect ing Wm. Coen, chairman; II. V. Lewis, secretary. 11. v.

Every body likes to start with tho Now year with his business in good shape if bo owos anything ho wants to know how much it is and if possible he pays it. If any one is indebted to bun ho calls on him and requests 11 settlement. A littlo deot is as much bother as a big one; a man will worry himself ten limes as mucli over ten little debts as he will over a biir debt. If ho ho cannot pay n 1 1 1 be will act wisely by paying off tho little debts and bo able to say at tho end of the year, "I don't owo but one debt in the world." A man who owes twonty or thirty debts of one to two dollars each will have tho character of a "dead beat" and will labor under greatdisadvantnges in tho transaction of his business. Whereas if he owes hut one debt, though it bo several hundred dol lars, bo mamnins his good reputa tion and crodit. Pny up your little debts and then do your lovel bost on tho big ones before the beginning ot the now year. The custom ol squaring up manors at tho close of each year is a great thing and saves many 1 man from being ongulfed in labyrinth ol debt. Proceeding of Ca licit of Orien- back Cvngrentmen.

Miss Mabel Hawkins recently began teaching a term of school at the Wil liams school house, in Carroll county. There was a birthday party at the res! dence of Mr. B. B. Hayden, last Tuesday evening.

A literary society was organized at the Leaton school house, last Friday night, which will meet regularly every Friday evening at half past 6 o'clock.

J The policy of tho Arthur min istration is supposed to be outlined in the President's Message. Tho President endorses the report and recommendations of iho Secretary of tho treasury, which commit the administration to the policy of per potuating tho presont banking sys tem, and giving tho National banks entiro control of tho currency, by culling in and destroying the re maining (350,000,000 of greenbacks and replacing tbom with bank notes; the suspension ot the coiuage ol sil ver dollars and tho payment of the bonds in gold. The secretary vug gests thnt tho 3 12 per cent bonds issued by Secretary Wiudora last summer to take tho placo of the 600,000,000 of 5 and Oper cent. bonds then duo, bo allowed to re main out subjoct to the call of the government, for payment at any time. This policy is to be commen ded. It is greatly to bo proforrod to that of refunding these bonds to run twenty or forty years. Tho proper thing to do, however, would bo to pay 8200,000,000 at once with tho surplus coin in tbo treasury and retire tho national bauk currency, issuing legal tender greenbacks to tako its place and pay that out on thCBo bonus. This would about close out this portion of our bonded dobt, ns tho bank circulation in about 360,000,000; surplus coin, $200,000, 000; total, 8560,000,000. Tbo adop. tion of this feasible, and sonsiblo plan would cut our interest account down 819,000,000 a year. Tho Secretary ol War asks for an incroaso ot tho army to tbe maxi mum of 30,000 troops, which reeom mondation is sufficient to gain my consent to his being replaced by some man who beliovcs in reducing the army to a peace footing, instead ot increasing it to a war standard, Speaker Keiler asks for time to ap point tho committees, bonce tho Houe adjourned till tho 13th There will not probably be much of note accomplished by Congross till after tho holidays. The President moved into the White Uouso on the 8th, that Re. publican palaco having been refur nished throughout for a second time within tho year. What becomes of the old furnlturu semi-annually dis carded is one of tho conundrums of politics which ovorybody gives up Uur 1 residents are getting to be ul most as snobbish ns tho King of an cient Lydia, who refused to dino the second time on tho samo silver plate or drink from a golden goblet ho had used before. 1 think it tho proper thing to abolish the Whito Uouso as a public institution, an let tho President buy or ront houso and furnish and run it nt hi own private exponse. His salary of 80,()()U a year is sulliciont to onabl him to do that, and live in comlort if not cleganco. It is un outrago on tho people, Unit in addition to the President's salury they should bo taxed to support bim in royal styl at an exponse of from $350,000 to $500,000 a your. T. A. B.
