8 THE GREATEST OF CIVILIZED STATES. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain's Allusion to the American Nation, In Discussing Home and Foreign Affairs at a Conservative Gathering in England. Rejoices at the Growth of Friendly Relations Between Great Brit ain and the United States—The Anglo-Saxon Race Allied, There is no Other Coinhination That Could Make Them Afraid. LONDON, Dec. 8— Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, speaking at a Conservative gathering in Wakefield, Yorkshire, this evening, fully discussed home and for eign affairs, and the Government's pol icy in Egypt, which, he said, depended entirely upon the possibility of reach ing an understanding with France, "a thing which is impossible as long as the French pursue a policy of exaspera tioh." With regard to the relations between Great Britain and Russia, in connec tion with the Far East, he said that while hitherto the endeavors to reach an agreement had failed, he believed an agreement with Russia was neces sary, unless very serious complications were to be encountered. There were, he continued, no insurmountable ob stacles to an agreement. On the con trary, it was quite possible to conciliate the reasonable ambition of Russia with the fixed policy of Great Britain to maintain equal opportunities of trade for all nations. "I am more sanguine of arriving at a settlement." said Mr. Chamberlain, "be cause it is not for our interest alone. The objects we have in view are shared also by the United States, Germany and Japan, all of which have identical in terests. I dare say you have observed the very pregnant passage in the recent message of President McKinley to the United States Congress, the passage referring to the very important inter ests of America in the East, in which he declares that these interests shall not be prejudiced by exclusive treat ment. That is a very noteworthy pass age, and without being a prophet. I think I shall not be too sanguine if I say that in the future we shall not stand alone as guardians of the 'open door.' " Mr. Chamberlain then referred to the charges of inconsistency brought against him in boasting Great Britain's splendid isolation, and then touting for alliances. He said: "When I referred to isolation, I meant the isolation of the British Empire, comprising the United Kingdom and our children over the seas, who are well able to defend their possessions and their own exclu sive interests against all attack, but surf ly it is not unreasonable to seek an alliance and to expect co-operation where the interests involved are those of others as well as of ourselves. "In the case of Germany, we have asm talr.ed by a friendly and frank in terchange of opinion that there are many interests regarding which we can assist one another. I think I may hope that in the future the two nations —the greatest naval and the greatest mili tary Power —will come more frequently together, and our joint influence will be used in behalf of peace and unre stricted trade. "But, if I congratulate you upon the development of good feeling between us and a great continental State, still more do I rejoice at the growth of friendly relations between ourselves and our colonies, between ourselves and the United States. Already the United States, if regarded from the standpoint of potential resources, is the greatest of civilized States—with its immense population of intelligent citizens, chief ly Anglo-Saxons, and if we are assured of the Anglo-Saxon race, whether it abides under the Stars and Stripes, or the Union Jack, there is no other com bination that can make us afraid." Replying later in the proceedings to a vote of thank.s for his address, Mr. Chamberlain said he hoped, ere many years had pa«sed, to see a federation of the empire with colonial representatives in the Imperial Parliament. Referring to a personal allusion to "his setting a good example in forward ing; the hoped-for alliance with the United States by marrying an Ameri can," he said: "So many Englishmen are following the example that I think it quite possible that the alliance may be accomplished without the interfer ence of governments." (Laughter.)

Action to Recover Money Deposited in a Bank. David Parker has sued the Farmers' and Mechanics* Bank to recover $1,000 deposited in said bank by Jerry Par ker a year ago. The latter assigned his bank account to the plaintiff, but the bank declined to pay over the money without an order of court. The suit is an amicable one, as will be seen by the answer filed by Devlin & Devlin, attorneys for the bank. They say: Now comes the above named defend ant, and answers the complaint of plaintiff, as follows: Admits the allegations contained in paragraph 1 thereof, and also in para graph 4 thereof; but denies generally and specifically all the other allega tions and averments contained in the said complaint, for the reason that it has no information or belief upon the subject sufficient to enable it to an swer. As to the matters set forth in para graph 2 of the said complaint, it avers that it has no information or belief as to the same, and therefore denies each and every allegation therein con tained. Defendant admits that there • has been exhibited to it an instrument ; which plaintiff claims is legally suffi icient to assign and transfer the deposit | mentioned in the complaint to the j plaintiff, but this defendant is in | formed by its counsel that there is a doubt as to the legality and sufficiency of said assignment; and hence plaintiff and defendant have agreed to submit the matter to this court in a friendly action for determination. Influential Women in the East. Fashion is a twofold movement. In its large evolution a. type dominates for some generations or so. with modifica tions so slow as to be unperceived, the result of social conditions prevailing in the civilized world, forming the drift that is referred to above that is Rot controlled; in its special action it is a variation from season to season and from day to day, a constant individual creation on the same general theme. This second movement is the one that is popularly recognized. It is due to woman's present social status, which forces her to constant effort to set herself off from other women or to emulate other women, by her dress, as men are forced to emulate other men, cr to distinguish themselves from the mass of men, by force or by intellect. The end pursued by both is singular ity that is to say, distinction from others, and with women by distinction by beauty.—Scribner's. Estate of S. S. Nixon. Alice F. Stevens, by her attorneys, Hinkson & Elliott, has petitioned the Superior Court for permission to sell personal property of the estate of her father, the late Samuel S. Nixon, in or der to meet certain claims against the estate. These amount to $413.15. iriLE

It is reported that the Pope will soon publish an important encyclical on sub versive parties, addressed to the labor ing and working classes, in which he will recall them to respect for religion and obedience to those placed over them. Leo XIII. has remembered with interest the mission given to him by Pope Gregory XVI. when he was only twenty-eight, and only a few weeks after he had celebrated his first mass. At that time the province of Benevento, which belonged to the Papal States, but was almost surrounded by the terri tory of the kingdom of Naples, was in a much worse degree than Switzerland now is—a nest of smugglers, brigands and revolutionists. To put an end to this state of things the then Monsignor Pecci was sent there as Papal Dele gate; that is to say, with full powers. He acted with extreme energy, once sure of the troops at his disposal, at tacking the leaders of the malefactors, dispersing their bands and making most of them prisoners. The latter, heavily chained, were carried through the streets, as an example to the peo ple, and to reassure the respectable in habitants. m In this work Monsignor Pecci was greatly assisted by a brave and intelli gent officers, Signor Sterbini, who be came his confidant, and when the ec clesiastic was elected Pope he nomin ated Sterbini as Scalo Segreto (secret carver), a very important position at the Papal court, for the holder of that office is the only person present at the meals of the Pontiff. Sterbini died in 1885, and his son has stepped into his place. Monsignor Pecci had to resort to drastic measures to stamp out smug gling, for it was practised and support ed by the most prominent peopie of the district; in fact, a certain Marquis, was was suffering from the rigorous or ders given by the delegate, was au dacious enough to*go personally to Monsignor Pecci to complain of what he called the "want of respect" shown 'by the customs officers toward him. The Pope's representative began by I treating the Marquis with couitesy. pointing out that the laws applied equally to all, high and low; but this reasoning, instead of convincing the Marquis, made him so angry that he declared he would go to Rome and not rest until he had obtained the dole gate's recall. "Very well," answered Monsignor Pecci, with that dignity and calmness which characterized him, "take your complaints to Rome, but do not forget that to go to the Vatican you have to pass by Castle St. Angelo!" (the famous prison). That same evening Monsignor Pecci had the castle of the Marquis surrounded by the Pontifical troops and every soul in it arrested. His suspic ions that the place was the headquar ters of a band of smugglers were fully Confirmed. —Rome correspondence of the Pall Mall Gazette.

REPRESENTATIVE ROBERTS. UTAH'S NEW CONGRESSMAN MAY BE UNSEATED. Women of the Country Will Make a Determined Fight Against the Polygamist. NEW YORK, Dec. B.—The "Herald" to-morrow will say: Efforts to pre vent Brigham H. Roberts. Repre sentative-elect from Utah, from taking his seat in the Fifty-sixth Congress be cause he is a polygamist and advocates that doctrine of the Mormon Church, is to have the organized support of hun dreds of thousands of women in the United States. The initial woman's movement is to take organized form in this city at a meeting of the Presbyter ian Woman's Board of Home Missions on December 120 th. There are a hundred thousand mem bers of the Presbyterian Home Mis sions Society alone in the United States. The Home Mission Societies of the Con gregational and Baptist Churches are preparing to make a similar campaign against Roberts, and the women's so cieties of other denominations are be coming interested in the fight. It is intended that all shall co-operate. The Congregational Home Missionary Society will take the matter up at a meeting to be held at the St. Denis Ho tel in January. This movement is not to be confined to missionary societies, but is to be started through them as a convenient way of arousing interest over the entire country. The women are to give infor mation regarding the Roberts case, and the supposed danger of the revival of polygamy, and to unite in obtaining personal letters to Representatives in all districts throughout the country, protesting against the seating of an avowed polygamist. Rev. Wm. S. Campbell, who has spent twelve years in Utah among the Mor mons, is in New York taking an active part in the fight against polygamy. He, with another speaker who has lived among the Mormons, will probably ad dress the coming meetings. Mr. Camp bell will dwell especially on the revival of polygamy in Utah. He says that the Presbytery of Utah is in touch with only seventy of the 310 postofflces in Utah. Reports received from these show 2,000 cases of polygamy, and that 1,000 polygamisit children have been born since Utah was admitted to State hood in 1895. In the women's fight against Roberts it is to be urged that if he is seated the Mormon Church will grant dispensa tions to many men to take more wives. Missionaries who have been studying the Utah situation say that many po lygamists are now making arrange ments to that end. Mrs. Darwin It. James, President of the Woman's Board of Home Missions, will preside at the meeting on Decem ber 20th in the Presbyterian building.
