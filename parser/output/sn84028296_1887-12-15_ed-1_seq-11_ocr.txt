THE DEMOCRATIC NORTHWEST, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1887. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THE SURPLUS AXDTHE TARIFF. . ie Danger of Too Blnch Cash In tb Vaults Re-adjustment Recommended. The President's message was seat to both i' -ousn o Congress Tuesday. The President opens with the statement that tb rereoot receipts frora all sources largely exceeds the turn necessary to meet the expenses of the jrovamment; that during the year ending - June 30, the exoess was over fifty-lire mit- lions. The President then shows that it be came necessary to cell in the three per cent bonds, also 4 and i per cents, interests on other bonds were anticipated and banks se lected as depositories of public money were permitted to increase their deposits. Not withstanding all this the surplus continued to Increase, and by June SO next, it is expected to amount to one hundred and forty mil lions. The supposition that the secretary of the treasury may make further bond pur chases seems to be the only relief in the pow er of the executive. The only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in an approprittion bill pawed a numter of years ago; and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as tem porary, and limited in its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and au thority. The President therefore wants legslation to provide checks and limitations, and at the v same time relieve the Secretary of the Treas ury from undueresponsibility. The President savs: In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating in the Treas ury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must of course be paid upon such purchase, . that there may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which cannot be pur chased at any period, and that combinations among holders who are willing to sell, may reasonably enhance the cost of such honds to the Government. Of course it is not expected that unneces sary and extravag nt appropriations will be made for the purpose of avoidingthe accum ulation of an excess of revenue. Such ex penditure, beside the demoralization of all just conceptions of publio duty which it en tails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvi . denes not in the least consistent witu the mission of our people, or the high and beneit ent purposes of our government It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its causes. It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary; there appears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to I nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the peo . pie. But our present tariff laws the vicious, inequitable and illogical source of unneces sary taxation ought to be at once revised and amended. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the B""' "leountry of this taxation. It must be exten tively continued as the source of the govern ment's income; and in a readjustment of i-ur tanif the interests of American labor en gaged in manufacture should be carefully ousidered, as well as the preservation of our manufacturers. ' But this existence should not mean a con dition which, without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of immense profits in stead of moderately profitable returns. As the voluu.e and diversities of our nation al activities increase, new recruits are added to ttiose who desire a continuation of the ad - Vantages which they conceive the present sys tem 01 urui taxation airecxiy aaoras mem. So stubbornly have all eftorts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow citizens thus eneaeeJ, that thev can hardly complain of the suspicion enter- UUiieu sv im uuu ejhuciib, tuut buere exreus an organized combination all a'oug the line to maintain their advantage. Bv the last census it is made to appear that of the 17,bU2,099 of our population engaged in all sons of industries, there are actually 8,ciW,UDS persons employed in such manufact uring iuuustrits as are claimed to be bene fited by a high tariff. To those the appeal is made to save their employment ana main tain their wages by resisting a change. There should be no disposition to answer such suggestions by the allegation that they ore in - a minority among those who labor, but the reduction of taxation deanuded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify tha toss of employment by the workingman, nor tLe lessduuig of his wagej, and the profits still remaining 10 the manufacturer, after a neces sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse . tor the sacrifice of the interests of his em ployees either in their opportunity to worn or in tne diminution of then- compensation. Nor can the worker in manufactures fail to under stand that while a high tai-Uf is claiiuei to be necessary to allow the payment of remuner ative wug.s, it certainty results in a very large inc. ease in the price of i.early all sorts of manufacturers, which, iu almost countless forms, lie needs for the use of himself and his family. He receives at the desk of his em ployer his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his home is obliged iu a purchase for faith of an article which em braces b.s own labor, to return in the pay ment of the increase in price which the tariff permits, the hard earued compensation of many days of toil. The farmer and the ugri- culturist who manufacture nothing, bat who pays the increased price which the tariff im poses upou every agricultural implement, up on alt -s wears ana upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things us his husbandry produces lrom the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the prtsant situation, ana he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for tiu) benefit of those who have sheep to 8ne.tr, in owner iba the prica of their wool may be mcreosed. The President then attempts t j prove the fallacy otaucli an argument, intro ducing facts and figures, and says: Wueu the number of farmers engaged iu wool raising is - compared with all the farmers in ihe country, ' anu die small proportioirtbey bear to our pop ulation ia u$ulxL iihftu.it is. maik. sg'Jdr : rent that, in the case of a large part of thtse who own sheep, the benefit of che present tar iff on wool is. illusory and above all, when it must be vonceeded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff, becomes a " burden upou tuose with moderate means and . the poor, the unemployed and employed, the sick aud well, and tue young and old, and that it constitutes a tax which, with relentless graBp, is fastened npon tue clothing or evury man, wouiau and cuild iu the laud, reuses ' i, re suggested why the removal or reducciou ot the uuty shouid oe lucluaed iu a revision of our taruflans. - ' J " In speuKiiig of the increased cost to the coiisuiudr of our home manufactures, requit ing Horn a uuty lnd upoii imported articles ' ot tue sameucscriptiou, the taut is not over looked tuut competition among our Uomestin producers sotueum.es lius tuo vifectof keeping uie price or. tueir products below the uiguesi, limit t-liowed juy such unty. tut in is uoto i rious that ih.a coinpctiuou .s . lot- ofwii . strati gled hy combinations quite prevalent as this tune, and frequently called trusts, which r. have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commoiities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration m the operation of these selfish schemes. The : necessity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point, furnish . es proof that some one is willing ,to accept lower prices for such commodity, and that ' such prices are remunerative; and lower prices produced by competition prove the y sime.thing. Thus, where either of these con ditions exist, a case would seem to be present ed for an easy reductian of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our, tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the government be pre vented by the reduction of our customs du ties. ' Under our present laws more than 4,000 ar ticles are subject to duty. Many of toeae do not in any way compete with our own manu- ucuires, ana many ar uruij atten tion as subjects ot revenue. A considerable reduction can be mm in the aeeiezata bT adding them to the ire i lint The taxation of luxuries proaquw du Lauum uz naraamp; out the neoesWies of life usl and eonmtneJ by til the people, the duty upja wuica adus to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened, The question of I reo trade is absolutely Ir relevant and the persiitinc diim mtdo ia certun quarters, that all efforts to relieve the the peopie from unjwt anu unnecessary tax ation are schemes of so-called free traders; is mischievous and far removed from any con sideration for the public good. The simple an t plain duty which we oe the people is to re duce laxuuou to the necessary expeiu.sot an economical operation of the government and to restore to (be uusiuau oi tad country the money which we hold iu the treasury tnrough ; the perversion of governmental powers. These things can ami should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our worsingmen need, and will benefit them and all our people, by cheapening tueir mains of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. HOW THE 

BANK." WAS WORKED. More of the Story of the Wreck that Harper Made. In tho Harper trial William Leuchter, in dividual book-keeper of the German National Bank, testified that the check of Swift's Steel and Iron Works tor $63,000, ot May 23, 1887, could not have been paid, as there was only $45.29 to their credit. Frank Marshall, in dividual book-keeper of the First National bank, detailed the chocks and balances of Wilshire, Eckert Sc. Co., since October, 1888, showing their acconnta to be frequently overdrawn. Ebene-sr Gay, individual book-keeper of the Merchants' Bank, swore that on May 7, J. W. Wilshire drew a check for $15,000 against a balance of $3,281.40. More testimony showed that Wishire's and Swift's accounts at these and J. Kuhu & Son's banks were often overdrawn. Mr. Hoy t said Mr. Harper was his .princi pal in the wheat deal, Mr. Hopkins having told him so, C. A. Hinch told how the three drafts of Wilshire, Eckert & Co. for $100, 000 each on the First National Bank were not entered on the book; how two checks of Benjamin E. Hopkins for $70,000 and $40, 393.75 were found in the cash, were replaced by checks of Wilshire) Eckert & Co. at Hopkins' instance, and traced the drafts from the Fidelity to bolster up the wheat deal IOWA BREWMRS (JIVE UP.

DICKINSON ' Mr. Dickinson will be the youngest mem ber of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet He was born at Auburn, N. Y., in 1845. His father Asa Dickinson, was a distant relative of Daniel S Dickinson,, but belonged to the Massachusetts Dickinsons. He went to Michigan when Don was a small boy. The new Postmaster-General was educated at the State University at Ann Arbor, graduating in 1808. . Three years later he received his diploma from the law school and began to practise. . At first he had a desk in his older brother's office. When the latter, already a rich man, went to New York to accept a re tainer of $10,000 a year from one of the largest dry-goods firms there, he gave his business to Don. ) s m On receiving this encouraging gratuity Don took into partnership" another Dickinson, Julian G., who was no kin whatever to him, but' knew how to collect debts. The two prospered and separated, but Don held to gether the large collection business, fn winch he had made a good deal of money. The firm is now Dickinson, Hosmer & Thurber, and the senior- partner is said to have an income-all told of over $40,000 a year. A large part of this comes from his collection bureau, which he runs independently ot the firm. He hires two or three good lawyers and a big corps of clerks am! pushes the busi ness with an energetic hand. He is famous for promptitude and never stops when he gets after a debtor until he nolle 'ts his judg ment and hands over the cash to hit client. He is said to be worth half a million, and Mrs. Dickinson, who was a Grand Rapids girl, has a fortune ot $150,000 in her own right They have only one child, a little girl three years old. Mr. Dickinson is a slender, black-haired man, with black side-whiskers flanking a thin, pale face. He has been a delogate-atHargti in every National Democratic Convention since 1876. He was- an enthusiastic Cleveland man long before the Chicago Convention, and never saw the President until he met him bv invitation- in Buffalo in December, 1884, when Mr." Cleveland had gone there to arrange his affairs preparatory to making his home in the White House. Then, in company with Judge Lothrop, now Minister to Russia, Mr. Dickinson called on Mr, Cleveland. The two took a fancy to e&ch other which time has only strengthened.
