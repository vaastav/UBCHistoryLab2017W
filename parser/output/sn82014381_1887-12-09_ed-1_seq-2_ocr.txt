BLAINE'S REPLY. Mr. Blame baa made with promptness a review of the President's menage, taking TadicaJ isßue mih him, ami enunciating tlic protective policy with force ar.d clear ness. He assails the position taken by Mr. < lereland for retention of internal revenue in order to force down the taring and thus expose American lalmr production to un wholesome foreign competition. But while In- would remove the domestic t«ilj;icc<i tax, Mr. Blame says that for moral reasons he! would retain the whisky tax. This he bases upon the assumption that decrease in price would enormonsly increase consnmp tion. Dpon that point we cannot think he is in correct. We do not believe that the drinkers of liquors would Bnd any re daction of price at the liar. In a gallon of whisky the reduction would, if made, be merely a cent or less per drink. On the contrary, the removal of the tax, besides abolishing an army of revenue offi cers, would remove also an incentive to fraud in compounding, and the consumer would really get better liquor than now, at the same price. Mr. Blame's claim forexpenditure of the surplus in enlarging coast defenses is one that will meet with hearty general ap proval. The nation docs not expect war, but it is the part of unwisdom to invite assault, or neglect those ordinary precau tions which contribute to our armed strength and inspire respect from other powers. As now situated, there is scarcely a port in the I'niti-d Suites that is not at the mercy of the ordinary ironclads of the weakest of the nations of the earth. As a whole, Mr. Blame's reply to the President is such- a one as will strengthen the protectionists greatly, and which will prove extremely annoying to free traders. Behind Mr. Blame's argument U the pres ent policy hi" the country which it is urged it ought to abandon. It has had the repu tation of l>eing popular with th<j people, and conservative of manufacturing labor and producing interests. That policy has the great advantage of being in poraession and its ouster, Mr. Cleveland will find, is no easy task, nor to l>e accomplished with out a very liv.ly shaking up of the whole country, in widen sectioaal interests will be compacted in one part of the land against those of another, and export ing and importing businesses :it the great Beaporta X- arrayed againtt'the manufact uring industries and the larger portion of industries dependent upon production from the soil. THE 

WOOL GEOWEES' PBOTEST. It was a rather singular coincidence that the annual aeasion of the Wool-Growers' and Dealers' National Association should In- held in Washington on the very <l;iy the President delivered his message to Congress. The Association let no grass grow under its feet in passing resolutions declaring the menage to be a direct "at tack upon their industry, one of the most important of the country, and in positive violation of the national Democratic plat form of l#B4 as interpreted by the party leaden and accepted by the rank and file of the party. The argument made by the President for the removal of our protec tion against foreign competition bone re peatedly made by the enemies of our in dustrial progress and effectively answered in nearly every school district of our land and bo thoroughly disproved by the logic of facts and the demonstration of experi ence and history a^ to Deed no answer from us." There can be no mistaking this language. The wool-growers are angered, and argu ment in rapport of the President's views will not be likely to mollify them. We continue their protest in those words: We had the ri».-iit to expert nmething differ rom the Chief Kieenttve of a nation tha mod bappy, prwperooi and co'.'.ented of any of the world, made bo by the policy ,-,{ protec tion anil development which he now seeks to destroy. We had the risrht to expect o;ir Presi dium would luvor the wool-prmvcrs of the ('nited Stated, and <-on less our deep disappoint ment that Instead he favors the Interests of our foreign competitor*. We nuke an appeal from his recommendations t. the (even mid three- Rniruu millions of otu fellow-citizens encased iv mamifrtof.irini:; to the array of wagc-earutrs to tradesmen and ruerehauls, knowing that their judgment arid decision will Ik- Ij :.sed upou justice and patriotism, and will therefore favor the maintenance of the Amirirun inilirv of pro tection, to which i!i<; country is indebted for its unexampled development «ud protperity. All of which and much more of like im - I">rt" >rt in the protest adopted, must be ple.i.— ant reading ior the Presides! and bis party, who see now that the frfrltarif in the path to a wcond term, and continued rnk by the Deinooracj, arc rising thick and fa.>t and are likoly to tower to th • po litical skies. Vet wo \i\uA rnilftail tliat President Cleveland i> not lacking in courage, fur he mast have known that nefa prou^ts aa the foregoing would be entered and that a dedanitioa of policy ooncern ing the taring which he mighl l i;1 vo loft for Congress to make, would bring about lii-cirs the whole anoy of protectionists j and raise np against him the opposition of a :*reat number of indoatriee of the conntry.

E4S3OK OK THE TARIFF. Hon. Join; A. K:\s-m. of ".>w:i. ;!i in the December Fanm the Western view 01 the taring considering the free ir .'.■-. pure :i!;. 1 simple, tli.- ' tari;:ii-.«-f..r-rcvc nuc-i.nly," nad theprota :': ••ni.-i:-. Ileholds that on thb absorbing question the soaks of juetice are held most evenly in tiie West, as it is 1101 prejudiced by the jn>;iti<al tra ditionsoi Jforth or Sooth, ami ■ .-Peking only the good of the wimle oonntry. To the free trader he declares there is no in vitation in the West, for he has not pro ■ciui'Cil any iacts to Mipport hi.-, theories. Tlie real rairtinrtanfai who Jo battle in the \Y>*st are the reveiimMaritnus and the protcetaookta. As to ntotetuon, the West kaa decided for its constitutionality ; the only question is as to the wisdom of or ad vantageousness of adopting the policy. The West has found liy examining the question, lie hold-, that the foreign pro ducer, if left to control our markets, will become a monopolist and regulate prices at his own will, Imt under a protective tarii! home producers and competitors, he be lieves, are multiplied far in excess of the nuin'ner of the foreign comj>etitors ex cluded. The West has found by experi ence, say-, Mr. Ka.-son, that protection of ! nan u fact i ire and production has kept up a good home market. Thus, Bessemer steel cost $1 "2o a ton. American EBanuTacturen onered to place it in market, if protected by a duty of $22 ">0 a ton — afterwards made s2B 12. When the competition un der that shelter began, the English drop ped their [trice, but competition went on, without destroying the American interest, until the steel sold for only a little in ex cess of the duty figure. So it was with the silk industry forcing down French prices. So that the West ha- conn- to be lieve firmly that protection does not en hance values, and does encourage industry, and from this belief Mr. Ka.sson docs not think the West can l>e shaken, for it found besides that there was, along with protec tion, an increased supply of money, as our imports fell below mir exports. The fann ers of the West are Gnnly fixed in the be lief that they are producing more food than the country consumes, and that more formers would increase the surplus and lower prices; they therefore want home industries developed, in order to enlarge the number of mouths to be fed. Besides, he add?, the West " prefers home competi tion at the same price to foreign, even were the latter to U> of equal extent with the former." Be proceeds in this view at length, and to the patriotic phase of the question, and holds that the West is for protection because of ancestral advice, patriotic purpose and a desire for complete national independence. How such views which must lie taken to retlect the major portion of the sentiment of the West, are to be estimated in a political contest, in view of President Cleveland's " scale down-the-tariH" message, is not difficult to understand. 

WESTERN FAEMEBS SOLVENT. The labor orators — probably because misinformed, for they have nothing to gain by misrepresentations — have been telling the people that the farmers of the west part of the country groan beneath a burden of debt secured by mortgage. But now comes Mr. Edward Atkinson, the accomplished statistician, and Bhows by indisputable figures that the farmers of the West are ahead of their creditors. Thus of 200,000 Western mortgages on farm land covering from four to thirty-eight years, and securing $180,000,000, 119,000 have been itnid in the .sum of £10-3,000,000. This does not look like following a losing vocation. So, too, while they have been paving off, from profits made from the soil, interest has declined from an average of 10 per cent, on mortgages for live years, to 0] or 7.1 per cent, without commission, where formerly 10 per cent, commission was charged. F. J. Babson, President of the "Fish ery Union," is out in print saying that hi s association will never consent to commer cial union with Canada. Willingly, per hap.s not ; it was never anticipated. New England coast communities are not ex pected to be friendly to the scheme of reciprocity. The people of the whole country, ho Fever, .ire to settle this matter, and we believe it will be done by them upon a reciprocal basis and a probable breaking down of the tariff line between the Canada* and the United States, and the erection of a tariff harrier similar tn oar own along the whole exterior line of the United state* and the Canadas. Com mercial nni<m between the two countries is very nearly as certain ea the rising ( >f the sun, but it may be delayed a tew years, owing to the. resistance of such associations as the " Fishery Union, 11 The San Francisco Bulletin makes a good point when, referring to the President's claim that unjust taxes sin, uld lie removed from the necessaries of life, it saw* : "If the alimentary necessaries of life are meant it is only necessary to rejoin that nearly all these are produced in the United States, and are, therefore, not subject to import duties. Tea and coflee are produced in foreign countries, but they are on the free list. They were formerly taxed, but when the import duty which we imposed on them was taken oflj Ihe countries, from which we get them levied an exjHirt duty to the same amount, or nearly so. Con sumers gained nothing. Our Government dmply gave $10,000,000 of its revenue to Brazil, Java, Costa Rica, China and other countries." TllK Citrus Fair to be held at Oroville, Buttc county— beginning on the 20th— the very heart of Northern California proper, should l>e kept in view in making engage ments. During that fair a great many of our people should attend it, and do all that can be done to make the fact of its l>eing held and the character of the exhibits widely known. It is at Once an advertise" meat for the north, :t protest against mis representation and a proof of the semi tropio character of this region. OoxraßSsntAH Brace, a Democrat, thinks the President's tariff i>olicy would be disastrous to wool interests. If that is so, becaßse Mr. Biggs comes from a wool growing section, how can he defend the policy against the objections of other inter ests ns vitally affected as is wool growing? Let the forecast be ventured \v>\\- — the Democracy will not renominate Mr. Cleve land, became Democracy a not so cour ageons aa Mr. Cleveland, and will endeavor to before the country in l^^s with the tariff loft out of its platform.

BLAISE'S "CORKER." Conclusion of Blame's Criticism of Cleve- land'x Message. Following is the portion of the interview with James G. Blame received after the Rkcord-I'mos's report closed yesterday: " How will the President's message be taken in the South ? " " I don't care to answer that question. The truth has been so long obscured by cer tain loyal questions of unreasoning prejudice nobody can hope for industrial enlightenment among their leaders yet; but in my view the South, above all sections of the Union, needs a protective tariff. The two Virginias, North Carolina. Kentucky, i Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia ' have enormous resources and fair facilities i tor developing and handling manufactures. I They cannot do anything without protec- ! tion, even the progress, vast as some of these States have made, will be checked if the President's message is enacted into law. Their Senatorsand Representatives can pre vent it, but they are "so uaed to following anything Democratic that it is very probable they will follow the President and blight the progress already made. By the time some of the Southern States get free iron, ore and coal, while tobacco is taxed, they iuay have occasion to sit down and calcu late the value of Democrat free trade to their interests.' 

ADMISSION OK RAW MATERIAL. " Will not the President's recommenda tion to admit raw material lind strong sup port?"' "Not by wise protectionists, in our time. Perhaps some greedy manufacturers may think with free coal or free iron ore they can do great things, but if they should suc ceed in trying they will, as the boys say. catch it on the rebound. If home trade in raw material is destroyed or seriously in jured, the railroads will be the first to feel it. If tiiat vast interest is crippled in any direction, the financial fabric of the whole country will feel it quickly and seriously. If any man can give a reason why we should arrange the farilf to favor the raw material of other countries in competition against our material of the same kind, 1 should like to bear it. Should that recom mendation of the President h i approved, it would turn 1.00u.000 laborers out of em ployment before it had been a year in op eration." 

EFFECT OF THE MESS.UiE. "What must be the marked and general effect of the President's message?" "It will bring the country where it ought to be brought — to a full and i'uir contest on the question of protection. The President himself makes it the one issue by present ing no other in his message. 1 think it well to have the question settled. The Democratic party in power is a standing menace to the industrial prosperity of the country. That menace should be removed or the policy it foreshadows should be made certain. Nothing is so mischievous to business as uncertainty, nothing to para lyzing as doubt." WaDls Information. The following letter has been received i>v a citizen in Auburn, from A. L. liateiuan of Indiana : "In the hard winter of 1852-3 when Hour got up to $1 per pound in Downie ville and along the Yuba, I was mining a short distance below Goodyear'a l*ar. Fluur at $1 per pound and other articles in pro portion seemed to threaten a slight embar rassment in ray financial circumstances be fore the opening of the spring, and I shouldered my blankets and started across the mountains through snow about six feet deep for Foster's Bar. From Fosters I went to riacerville (known everywhere as Haugtown then), and passed through Au burn, spending two or three days there. Well, I never saw Auburn again till two months ago returning home from a trip to Southern California, where I had been looking over the country for eighteen months. I again passed through Auburn and I want to say to you that in the foot hiils .jf the Sierra ( I spent ten years ainmi" them in the early days), is the finest the most delightful country,' in California. 1 found land about Loa Angeles selling all the way from .S2OO to $1,500 ncr acre. I thought it a little 100 hitrh. The cliniate is good, but it is hardly worth $1,500 per acre. " Now, what I want to know is some thing about your section. What is good fruit land worth with yon, improved and unimproved? What do you raise prin cipally ? Are your vineyards troubled with diseases'.' How about water supply .' < a n you folks do as much lying about your country as they- do in the southern part of the State? If you can and do, then don't write to me, for God'a sake; but ii you can tell me something reliable about your sec tion, I want to hear from you, and want to hear from you bad. Send'me your county paper. I don't care anything about its religion or its politics ; I simply want to hear something about the country, and am led to believe irom eignteen months' ex perience in the coast counties that a Cali fornia newspaper is reliable and won't lie except for a consideration. Excuse me if I am asking a good deal of you, but I am presuming a little on being an old Cali fornian and want to get back to the mount ains." Trouble at, the Ouarrle*. The Auburn Reptiblican says : " The stone-cutters who have been working for G. Griffith struck on Thanksgiving Day and left his employment They had an nounced that on January Ist tbtv would demand $\ a day, but the cause of their "juittiriK earlier was the fact that Mr. (irif iith had employed more apprentices at tht< Hocklin quarry thau the cutters thought ought to have work. Six cutters went out at Fenryn and nine at Rocklin. Tlitseman were receiving $3 50 a day for ten hours' work. There has been a Union •,' Penryn and Bocklin stone-cutters, and it is this or ganization which ordered the strike. Their rule is, like that of ihe National Union, that an employer shall have only one ap prentice to ten journeymen. S,i:u<. time ago Mr .Griffith obtained the contract for famishing .nr;;nite for the new Stockton Oourt-house. The contract calls for about 10.000 feet of stone, and was taken at the very low price of $100,000. .Mr. Griffith needed men for this work, but the an nouncement of the cotters that they W uld demand $4 a day had the effect of kseping other workmen out of the county, so that those already at work c juld more easily enforce their demands. Mr. Griffith found himself in a dilemma. He saw that he must accede to their demands and pay $4 to all union men, whether they were worth it or not, or else take the bull by the horns and till his contracts by hiring non union men. He chose the latter course, and hired i number of apprentices with ihe result already stated. Xo great trouble is expected, as ih?re are already several men at work, some of them apprentices, who have nearly served their time and will soon be journeymen, and others from the East. The regular qaarrrmen are all at work as usual. The report that Mr. Griffith ejected any of the strikers from his houses is false. The Stockton contra "t will probably last two years, and at times it will require fifty or sixty cutters. Any nood mechanic will be given w>rk. when thereis room for him, and, if he is worth $4 a day, the chances are that he will get it.'' What Am I to Do? The symptoms of Biliousness arc unhap pily but too well known. They ditTer in different individuals to some ext«nt. A Bilious man is seldom a breakfast-eater. Too frequently, alas, he has an excellent appetite for liquids, but none for solids of a morning. Ilia tongue will hardly bear inspection at any time; if it is not' white and furred, it is rough at all events. The digestive system is wholly out of order, and Diarrhea or Constipation may bo a symptom, or the two may alternate. There are often Hemorrhoids or even lon of blood. There may b» giddiness and often headache and acidity or flatulence and tenderness in the pit of the stomach. To correct all this, if not effect a cure, try Green's A.UKtwt Flower. It costs but a infle, art.i thousands attest its efficacy. Cokbcctom Di-ohakgkd — A number of ooßdoctoraon the Canadian Taciric have got themselves into trouble.

INDUSTRIES. Profitable Cultivation of Horehound and Bergamot in Butte County. Oroville, December 7. 1887. Eds. Record-Union : I notice a telegram in your Issue of the tith inst., from Redding, mentioning an establishment there of an apiary by W. If. Hoge. This gentleman is establishing an apiary fifteen miles from here and has twenty acres of horehound under cultivation. Last spring he brought 200 swarms of bees through here, and I understand from his Superintendent that these increased during th° summer to 275 swarms. This horehound plant is the most won derful honey producer I ever saw and the bets cluster in great numbers upon it. I understand that Mr. Hoge t who is from Brooklyn, New York), calculates to average next year 250 pounds of this horehouud houey to the swaim, and that lie has had overtures made him by a large New York druggist for his entire production for the next twenty-five years at fifty cents per pound, but his crop has yielded him up to this time fully one dollar per pound.
