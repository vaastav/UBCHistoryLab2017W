g he f^cynhH WATERTOWN, WIS, J. H, KEYES ; Editor and Proprietor. English Lunches. The dinner in England being so state ly and formal an affair, so exacting in its requirements of full dress and knowledge of etiquette, can only be agreeable to those persons to whom knowledge of society is second nature. The loads of queer celebrities who flock to England, and of whom Eng lish people are very fond, are often great bores at the dinner table. One literary lady of high eminence carried along a husband who drank out of his finger-glass; one French soldier of fortune tore the aspic of plover’s eggs, which stood before him, apart with his fingers ; one young lady of grasping disposition—l will not say what country she came from—reached for a bouquet from the grand epergne, and tipped it over. All these things are trifles, but they did that dreadful thing—discom posed the lady of the house. So there has grown up a species of entertain ment, absolutely necessitated (as I was told by a lady who entertained much) by these very accidents—a luncheon, informal, gay, early, a sort of midday dinner, where ladies sit in their bon nets and gentlemen in their morning coats—not the grand twelve-course affair which we give in New York at 1 o’clock and call luncheoi., but a simple entertainment—a joint of mutton, some fruit and salad, and perhaps claret and Madeira, the enter tainment is easy and perfect, and fitted to the enjoyment of everybody. At these pleasant affairs, there can be no violation of etiquette; for there is no etiquette t o violate. Every one is at ease. The houses of Parliament do not assemble until five o’clock in[the afternoon ; therefore the noble Lords and faithful Commons are at leisure. The ladies have the day before them. I suspect many of them who have been out until 3 the night before, make this meal their breakfast, and the guests of all nations contribute their quota to the agreeability without disturbing the English mind by any violation of those rules of life, which to them, and to polished people generally, are all-im portant.—Appleton's Journal . Famous Trees. Individual trees, planted by famous men, are still to be seen by the pil grims who visit their homes and haunts. In the last century there was quite a fashion for planting willows. It is said that the first weeping willow seen in England was sent to' the poet Pope, as a present from Turkey, by his friend Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and planted by him in his garden at Twick enham. It is the famous Salix Baby lonica of the Psalter, upon which, on the banks of the Euphrates, the weep ing daughters of Jerusalem hung their harps. Garrick planted two willows on his lawn, beside his Shakespeare tem ple ; in the Inidst of a thunder storm, which destroyed one of them, the pious widow of the great actor was seen running up and down, excitedly crying out, “Oh, my Garrick! Oh, my Garrick!” The willow, known as Dr. Johnson’s willow, at Litchfield, was blown down long ago ; it was said, in the Gardener’s Magazine, to have been planted by him, but it is more probable that his admiration and talk of it developed the legend of his plant ing it. At the time of its destruction, it was thirteen feet in girth. Pieces of household furniture and snuff boxes were made of it, and slips from it were planted, by his admirers, throughot the neighboring country ; an offset of the old tree was planted on the same site. Thomas Moore tells us that when Byron first went to Newstead Abbey, from Aberdeen, at the age of ten, he planted a young oak in some part of the grounds. He had a notion (or thought he had) that as it flourished so should he. Six or seven years later, on re-visiting the spot, he found his oak choked up with weeds, and almost dead.— Chamber's Journal. How Mrs- Browu Drowned the Kittens. She had been talking about it a good while, and Sunday she did it. While church was in she got the slop-pan, and wiped it out with her checked apron. Then she set that slop-pail in the wood shed, and filled that slop-pail with wa ter. Then she went to the barn and brought the kittens out by the nape of the necks, and put them into that slop pail. Then she went to the pantry, back of the fire-place, and took down a large tin dish and returned with that tin dish, and placed it over the mouth of that slop-pail. Then she put a brick and a rusty axe-head on top of that tin | dish. Then she rolled her arms in that checked apron, and rested upon her i left limb, all the while humming a se- ! rious air, and beating time to it with I the toe of her right foot. Then those | kittens sang small. Then, about an hour after this time, Mrs. Brown stop ped humming and tapping. Then she ; unrolled her arms out of that checked | apron. Then she bent down and re moved that brick and that axe-head from that tin dish. Then she took that tin dish off that slop-pail. Them she iuuked at those kittens, and pretty soon went into the house to see if the poiatoes were done.— Grip, Hants as Weather Guides. A Prussian horticulturist has made some interesting observations which t.-ud In show the usefulness of certain plants as weather guides. He finds that ceiiaiu varieties of clover contract their on the approach of rain ; when the 'eaves of the chickweed unfold and itM flowers remain erect till mid-day, far weather is at hand; but the closing of the flowers of the wood anemone indicates that rain is close at hand. Iwakura is said to have stated that he saw nothing in all his travels which astonished him so much as the changes vhich took place in Japan during his bsence. Many proofs are now* before the people of Japan that public opinion has great weight with the officials in the g ivernment and in all departments of state. The National Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury points out the failing oft in the revenue caused by the financial crisis, and bases the estimates of receipts somewhat ! thereon, shows the coin receipts are still more than the interest on the public debt and other coin ex penditures, recommends economy, reduction in appropriations, and, if the effects of the derange ment in business should continue and make it nec ' cssary to provide aicrvional means, ne recommends judicious additional taxation rather than resort to borrowing and increasing the public debt. The operations under the refunding act, for the year ending December 31,1573, make a saving of one million dollars in the annual interest. Tne entire saving of annual interest under its opera tions is three millions. He recommends that action be taken, before January next, for the payment of the $20,000,000 loan ofISSS; condemns the practice of paying in terest on deposits as tending to accumulate cur rency in large cities, where it is used largely by speculators whose operations tend directly to in crease the annually recurring stringency in the money market and to derange business generally- The Secretary alludes to the prevailing sentiment ' that more elasticity should be given to the volume of currency, and earnestly commends to the wis dom of Congress a careful consideration of the , subject, and that :n such inquiry further inflation of irredeemable paper currency should be avoided, I and a permanent return to the second basis of specie payment be kept in view. He regards any I large augmentation of legal tender notes in time i of peace as a departure from the declaration of public policy, and the pledge of the public faith to the national creditors made in the act of dune 80, 1874, that the amount of such notes should never exceed $4 )0,000,000, as well as from that more sol emn pledge contained in the first act of the Forty first Congress to make provisions at the earliest period of the redemption of United States notes in coin. lie refers to the uncertainty in public opinion as to the right and policy of issuing the forty-four millions, called the reserve, and recommends the exact status thereof be fixed by Congress. He op poses the issue of any part of the same to inflate the currency; suggests it be held for reserve under restriction; also recommends changes in the law, authorizing the national bank noces to be replaced as there are practical difficulties in carrying out the purpose of Congress under the present law. A thorough revision of the Custom laws is recom mended. The tonage tax should be repealed and new laws regarding the enrollment and license of vessels should be made, so far as they affect canal boats and similar crafts employed on the internal waters of states. The reorganization ©f custom districts on the Atlantic coast, and various changes in the laws respecting our navigation are recom mended. The Secretary details what has been the matter of the Louisville and Portland canal and suggests further legislation. Disaster at Sea. The steamship Ville du Havre, from New York for Havre, was sunk at sea by a collision with the British ship Locherne, on November 23. She had on board 313 persona, of which number only 87 were saved, making a loss of 226, The Yille du Havre was struck amidships by I the Locherne and sunk in twelve minutes after the collision. The Locherne immedi ately lowered their boats, which rendered all service possible by them. Fifty-three of the crew were saved, including the captain, and these go to make up eighty-seven saved. Among the passengers saved are ten women, | which number she transferred to the Tri- j mountain of New York, and they were taken to Cardiff. With the exception of the Great Eastern, she was the largest steamer that ever entered this port. Her dimensions were 430 feet by ’ 4.8 -feet. Her carrying capacity was 3.500 tons ! foreign measurement. Her main saloon was fitted up with marble wainscoting of three varieties; the upholstering was velvet, and the wood work carved in the most unique de signs. Her engines were compound direct acting, 3,200 horse power, made in England. The Ville du Havre was formerly the Napo i leon 111. She was altered and enlarged last winter, and came here for the first time as the Yille du Havre on the 9th of April, making the passage from Brest in nine days and twenty three hours. The Locherne was so badly damaged by the collision with the Ville du Havre, that persons rescued by her from the wreck requested to be put on the Trimountain. All were safely transferred with the exception of three per sons who were too badly injured to be re moved. After the collision the Locherne put for Queenstown, where she was due about the 29th ult. Nothing yet has been heard of her. The Cuban Question. Negotiations between the United Stales and Spain as regards the question growing out of the capture of the Yirginins were brought to a conclnsu i on Nov. 29, Fish and Admiral P io having agreed upon and signed a protoco which the latter soon ; after telegraphed bis Government. It is positively stated the terms are substantially as follows : First—lmmediate delivery to the United States of the ship Virginias and all surviving passengers and crew. Second—Salute to our flag on Dec. 25. un less in the meantime Spain shall satisfy the United States that the American flag was im properly borne on that vessel, and further, that she had no right to the American flag or American papers in this event the salute is to be spontaneously wi bdrawn, and Spain to formally disclaim any intent and indignity of the flag in tne acts committed by Spain against the Yirginins. Third—lf it be then shown she had no right to carry the American flag and papers, the United States will institute proceedings against the vessel and the surviving parties who have violated the law’s of the United States, and Spain guarantees to institute proceedings against her authorities who violated either law or treaty. Fourth—The matter of reclamations for damages is reserved tor future consideration. In addition to the above, it is that Sec retary Fish and the Spanish minister will de termine the pert at which the Virginias and he surviving passengers and crew are to be delivered to the United States. The words “ immediate release,’ 5 as applicable to the de livery of the Yirginins and the surviving pas sengers and crew, implies, of course, a rea sonable time for its execution, as some days must elapse before Havana and Santiago de Cuba can be reached. The agreement is remarked in official quar ters as covering ail points of our original de mand. though in a modified form, while it is considered respectful and honorable to both countries. The fixing of Dec. 25 as the time of saluting our flag is to allow a necessary op portunity to Spain to sho.v that the Yirginins improperly carried the American hag and American papers. There is a sensible- relie in all quarters that the negotiations are thus peaceably ended. Both Secretary Fish and Admiral Palo had for two weeks past been engaged in producing this result, on w hich they receive the congratulations of their re spective friends. A Laconia (N. H.) gardener lias raised a radish weighing 17 pounds.

The mes sage was then read, and the House adjourned. Senate. Washington, Monday, December 1. —The Senate was called to order at noon by Vice-President Wilson. The credentials of Robert Crozier* appointed to occupy Cald well’s seat, were received and the oath of of fice administered. The resignation af Senator Caeserly, of California, was announced. Mr. Sumner introduced a bill supplementary to the bill to protect ail citizens ot the United States in their civil rights ; also a joint reso lution proposing an amendment to the Con stitution ot the United States, so as to pro vide for the election of President of the United States by direct vote of the people, and abol ishing the offide of Vice-President.

The Senate then adjourned. House. The House was called to order at noon by Mr. McPherson, Clerk, who called the roll ot members by States. The galleries were crowd ed, and most of the seats in the L sllwere oc cupied. When Louisiana was reached, the Clerk stated that there were but two unchal lenged certificates received from that State— those of Messrs. Darrall and Morri, from the Third and Fifth Districts. As to the Ninth District of Indiana, papers were returned by the Governor which could not be accepted by the Clerk, as they were not in accordance with law, and, therefore, there was no person en rolled from that district. For four seats from Arkansas there had been but two certificates presented, those of Snyder and Hines. Coni pheations were also reported in regard to the State of West Virginia. Jamep G. blame was re-elected Speaker, receiving 190 votes, Fer nando Wood 77, S. S. Cox 2, Clymer 1. Alexan der H. fctevens 1. On taking'the chair. Mr. Blaine said : Gentlemen of the House The vote this moment announced by the Clerk is such an expression of your confidence as calls for mv sincerest thanks. To be chosen Speaker ot the American House of Representatives is al ways an honorable distinction. To be chosen a third term enhances the honoi more than three-fold. To be chosen by the largest body that ever assembled in the Capitol imposes a burden ot responsibility which only your indulgent kindness could embolden me to as sume. The first occupant ot the chair pre sided over a house of simply five members, ' representing a population far below the present I aggregate of the state of New York. At that j time in the whole United States there were ■ not 50,000 civilized inhabitants to be found ! 100 miles distant from the Atlantic tide. To * day, gentlemen, ala ge majority of you come from beyond that limit, and represent districts then peopled only by Indians and adventurous frontiersmen. The Government is not yet as old as many of its citizens; but in this brief span of time, less than one lengthened life, it has, under God’s good providence, extended its power until a continent is the field of its empire, and attests the majority of its law. With the growth ot new Stales, and the re sult of changes in the centers of population, new interests are developed, rival to the old, but by no means hostile ; diverse, but not au- I tagonistic ; nay, rather are all these interests 1 in harmony ; and the true science of just gov ' eminent is to give to each its full and fair j play, oppressing none by undue exactions, | favoring none by undue privilege. Et is this great lesson which our daily experience is : teaching us, binding us together more close ly, making our mutual dependence .more 1 manifest, and causing ns to feel, whether we i live in the North. South, East or West, that | we have indeed but “ one country, one Con | stitution, one destiny.” Mr. Dawes, senior* member of the House, i administered the oath of office to the | Speaker, who thereupon proceeded to swear ■ m the members, A message was sent to no tify tne Senate that the House was duly or gauized and ready to proceed to business. About fifty members from the Soutnern States, who could not take the oath of office, which is known as the “iron-clad,” took a modified oath. Prominent among them was Mr. Stephens, of Georgia. Edward McPherson was re-elected clerk. N. G. Ordway, Sergeant-at-arms; O. S. Burton, Doorkeeper; H, G. Sherwood, of Michigan, Postmaster, and Rev. J, B. Butler, Chaplain, The delegates trom the Territories were called and sworn in, with the exception of Geo. Q. Cannon, of Utah, in reference to whom Mr. Merriam offered a resolution recit ing that Cannon had taken an oath inconsis tent witicitizensltip and with his obligations as a delegate, and has been and continues to be guilty of practices in violation and defiance of the laws, and referring to the Committee on Elections the question of Cannon’s right to the seat. The resolution was tabled. The House then proceeded to the drawing of seats, and shortly afterwards adjourned. v Colorado and Consumption—John C. Heenan. Grace Greenwood in the N. Y. Tribune. I am convinced that consumption, in its earlier stages, can not only be ar rested, but cured, by a residence in Colorado ; but consumptives in the last stagas should by no means be sent out here. Sometimes they linger a ■ little longer, but more often the end is hastened, especially if the patient comes alone. The air of Manitou, ever so balmy to me, was too strong for poor John C. Heenan, oppressing his magnificent chest and producing hem orrhages. It seemed to all who saw him that he might live if he could only keep up heart—but he was utterly cast down. His sickness, comparatively sudden, the rapid decline of his splen did physical powers seemed to him so mysterious, so unnatural, that he was subdued and frightened. There was in his look the mute, pathetic helpless ness of some strong animal stricken down, but not “ consenting unto death.” lam glad to have it to say that Mr. Heenan expressed to his physician great regret and a manly shame for much of his past career, and a humble desire to live, that he might “ lead a better life.” Coffin never clos ed over a more superb human figure than his—was all chance for a “ better life ” buried with that abused and wasted body. Sending Babies to Sleep. Some of the hill tribes in Northern India have a peculiar way of sending their babies to sleep, which is thus de scribed by a correspondent of a Bom bay paper: “Near a hollow bamboo, which served as a spout, through which the cold water of the mountain stream poured forth a jet, was disposed the head of an infant, who was lying cov ered warmly and fast asleep. The bamboo spout was so placed that the water played upon the crown of the baby’s head, over a part which seemed bald of hair, a consequence, perhaps, of the habitual action of the water. The rest of the child’s body was not touched by the water. The children, (there were two of them) were lying on their right sides, and perfectly still, one would fancy in a state of stupefac tion. They had been lying for an hour and a half, we were told, and would be there till 9 o’clock at night, in all be tween four and five hours. I felt the face of one of them, and found it cold, and then held the wrist, but could de tect no pulse. Yet these hill people are convinced that this strange prac tice, which is quite general, helps to strengthen the brain, and make the children not only healthy, but hardy and fearless.” One Thing Lacking, A clergyman at the hotel has been seriously ill for a few days past. A kind-hearted nurse, in the person of an old pioneer of this state, a ’49er, has been patiently waiting on the sick man and ministering to his physical wants. The nurse was full of sympathy for his charge, and determined to leave noth ing undone that he could do to make his patient comfortable. Fearing that the sick man was backward in making known bis wants, the nurse addressed him as follows : “ Ask of me any favor that you want, and I will be delighted to do it. Don’t be afraid to ask.” The clergyman faintly responded, “ Pray for me. ” The ’49er stood aghast, and replied : “I can whip a grizzly bear, play poker, drink a gallon of lightning whisky, and swear a blue streak, but T the inside of achurch'Jor twenty-five years, and can’t pray. Don’t know where to begin, what to say, who to talk to, nor when to let up. I’ll go out on tbe street and whip the biggest man in town for you—anythink but make a prayer.” The minister entertains a high opinion of his nurse, and is getting better. —Nevada Enter prise. IVhat a Pair ot Sparrows Can Do. From St. Nicholas. By careful investigation it has been ascertained that a single pair of Euro pean sparrows, during; the infancy of their brood, feed their little ones an average of about 3,360 caterpillars in a week! Now, take your slates and pencils, my little friends, and see how many caterpillars in a month the sparrows killed by that Sussex County club would have destroyed if they had been permitted. Think what quanti ties of pretty leaves, how many bush els of grain, and what an abundance of_ nice fruit must be destroyed by the i taking off of 17,000 worm-eating birds. THE 

MESSAGE. Our Foreign and Domestic Relations. The Capture of the Viiginius and Our Demands Relating There.c. Important Amendments to the Constitu tion Recommended. Slavery in Cuba the Cause of the Trouble There, Washington, December 2, 1873. To the Senate and House of Representatives : The year that has passed since the submis sion cjf my last message to Congress has, es pecially the latter part of it, been an eventful one to’the country. In the midst of great national prosperity, a financial crisis has oc curred that has wrung large fortunes from a great proportion. Political partisanship has almost ceased to exist, especially in the agricultural regions, and the capture upon the high seas of a vessel bearing our flag, has at one time threatened the most serious consequences, and occupied the pub lic mind from one end of the country to the other. Tins, happily, is now' in the course of satisfactory adjustment, honorable to both nations concerned. Tue relations of the Uni ted States, however, with most of the other nations continue to be friendlv and cordial, with France, Germany, Russia, Italy, and the minor powers, with Brazil and most of the South American Republics and with Japan. Nothing has occurred during the year to de mand special notice. The correspondence between the Department of State and various diplomatic representatives in or from those countries is transmitted herewith. In executing the will of Congress as ex pressed in its joint resoiution ot the 14th of February last, and in accordance with the pro visions of the resolution, a number of practi cal artisan? and scientific men, and of honor ary commissions were author zed to attend the Exposition at Vienna as commissioners on the part of the United States. It is believed that we have obtained the object which Con gress had in view when it passed the joint resolution in order to enable the people ot the United States to participate in the advantages of the international exhibition of tbe pro met of agriculture, manufactures and the tine arts to be held at Vienna. I take pleasure in adding that the American exhibitors have re ceived a gratifying number of diplomas and medals during the Exposition. A conference was held at Vienna for the purpose of consultation on the systems pre vailing in different countries for the perfec tion of inventions. I authorized a representa tive trom the Patent Office to be presen t at Vienna at the time when this conference was to take place, in order to aid, as far as he might, in securing any possible additional protection to American inventions in Europe. The report of the agent wil. be laid before Congress. It is my pleasant duty to announce to Con gress that the Emperor of China, on attain ing his majority, received the diplomatic rep resentatives ot the western powers in per son. An account of these ceremonies, and of the interesting discussions wfiich preceded them will be found in the documents trans mitted herewith. The accompanying papers show that some advance, although* slight, has been made during tbe past year towards the suppression of the infamous Chinese coolie trade. I recommend Congress to inquire whether additional legislation be not needed on this subject. THE GENEVA AWARD. The money awarded to the United States by the tribunal of arbitration at Geneva, was paid by Her Majesty’s Government a few days in advance of the time when it would have be come payable according to the terms of the treaty, in compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3d, 1873, it was at once paid into the Treasury and used to redeem, as far as it might, the public debt of the United States, and the amount so redeemed was in vested in a five per cent, registered bond of the United States for fifteen millions five hun dred thousand dollars, which is now held by the Secretary of State subject to the future disposition of Congress. I renew my recom mendation, made at the assembling of the last session of Congress, that a commission be created for the purpose of au diting and determining the amounts of the several direct losses growing out of the de struction of vessels and their cargoes by the Alabama and the Shenandoah after leaving Melbourne, for which the sufferers have re ceived no equivalent or compensation, of ascertaining the names of the persons entitled to receive compensation for the same; making the computations £on the basis indicated by the tribunal ot arbitration at Geneva, and that the payment of such losses be authorized to an extent not to exceed the awards of the Tribunal at Geneva. THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY. By an act approved on the 14th day of February last, Congress made provision for completing jointly with an officer or commissioner to bp named by Her Brit tanic Majesty, the boundary line between the territory of Great Britain, as was left uncom pleted by the commissioners appointed under the act of Congress of August 11th, 1856. Under the provisions of this act the northwest water boundary of the United States has been determined and marked in accordance with the award of the Emperor of Germany. A protocol and a copy of the map upon which the line was thus marked are contained in the papers submitted here. I also transmit a copy of the report of the Commissioners for marking the boundary between tbe United States and the British "Possessions west of the Lake ot the Woods, of the operations of the Commissioners. During the past season sur veys have been made to a a point 497 miles west of the Lake of tbe Woods, leaving about 350 miles to be surveyed, the field work of which can be completed during the next sea sdn. CLAIMS. The commission organized under the pro visions of the treaty of Washington for' the settlement and determination of the claims of citizens of either,power against the other, arising out of acts committed against their persons or property during the period be tween April 13th, I*B6l, and April 9th, 1865, made its first award on the 25th day of Sep tember last. It was awarded that the Gov ernment of the United States should pay to the Government of Her Brittannic Majesty, within twelve months from the date of the award, the sum of $1,929,819 in gold. The commission disallowed or dismissed all the claims of British subjects against the United States. The amount of the claims presented by the British Government, but disallowed or dismissed, is understood to be about ninety three millions ot dollars. It also disal lows all the claims of the United States against Great Britain which were referred to it. I recommend the early passing of an act appropriating the amount necessary to pay this award against the United States. I have caused to be communicated to tne govern ment ol the King of Italy the thanks of this government lor the eminent services rendered by Count Conti, who, as the third commis sioner of this commission, with dignity, learn ing and impartiality discharged the duties re quiring great labor and constant patience, to the satisfaction, I believe, of both govern ments. I recommend legislation to create a special court to consist of three judges, who shall be empowered to hear the claims of aliens upon the United States, arising out of acts committed against their persons or property during the insur rection. The recent conference under the treaty of Washington was confined to claims of British subjects arising during the period named in tbe locality, but it is understood that there are other British claims of a simi lar nature arising after the sth of April 1865, anti it is known that other claims of like nature are advanced by citizens or subjects ot other powers. It is desirable to have these claims also examined and disposed of. Official information being received from tkc Dutch government of a state of war between the King of the Netherlands and the Hultan of Acheen, the the officers of the United states who were near the seat of war, were instructed to observe an impartial neutrality. It is believed that they have done so. The joint commission with Mexico of 186S, having again been legally prolonged, has again resumed its business, which, it is hoped,may be brought to an earlv conclusion. The distinguished representative of Her Britainic Majesty at Washington has kindly consented, with the approval ot his Govern ment, to assume the ard ous and responsible duties ot umpire in this mmission, and to lend the w eight ot his character and name to such decisions as may not receive the aouui* escenca of both the arbitrators appointed bv the respective governments. OUTRAGES ON TEE TEXAS BORDER. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the authority ot Congress to examine into the nature and extent ot the foravs bvS e 8 from that country upon the herds of Texas have made a report, which will be submitted for your consideration. CLAIMS AGAINST VENEZUELA. The Venezuela Government having been apprised of the sense ot Congress in regard to the award of the joint commission under the convention of the 25th of April. 1866, as ex pressed in the act of the 25th ot February last, it is apprehended that that Govern ment does not realize the character ot its obligations under that convention. As there is reason to believe, however, that its hesitancy in recognizing them arises, in part at least, from the real difficult!* in dis charging them in connection with its' obliga tions to other governments, the expediency of farther forbearance on our part is believed to be worthy of your consideration. TURKEY. The Ottoman government and that of Egypt have latterly shown a disposition to re lieve foreign Consuls of the judicial powers which heretofore they have exercised in the Turkish dominions, by organizing other tribunals. As Congress, however, has by law provided for the discharge of judicial func tions by Consuls of the United States in that quarter, under the treaty of 1830,1 have not felt at libeity to accept the present change without the assent of Congress, whose deci sion upon the subject, at as early a period as may be convenient, is earnestly requested. SAN 

DOMINGO. I traDsmit here for the consideration and determination of Congress an application of the republic of Santo Domingo to this Gov ernment to exercise a protectond power over that republic. TREATIES. Since the adjournment of Congress the fol lowing treaties with foreign powers hive been proclaimed: A naturalization convention with Denmark ; a convention with Mexico for renewing the Claims Convention; a conven tion ot friendship, commerce and extradition with the Orange Free State ; and a naturali zation convention with Eacador. POST OFFICE COMMISSIONS. I renew a recommendation made in my message of December 1870, that Congress au thorize the Post Master General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through his department. RIGHTS OF CITIZtNS ABROAD. I invite the earnest attention of Congress to the existing laws of the United States re specting extradition and eligibility of individ uals. Many citizens of the United States re side permanently abroad with their families : under the provisions of an act ap proved February 10th, 1855, the children of such persons are to be deemed and taken to be citizens of the United States, but the rights of citizenship are not to descend to persons whose fathers never resided within the United States have been unable to put forward pretensions to the protection of the United States against the claim of military service of the government under whose pro tection they hare been born and reared. In some cases unnaturalized citizens of the United States have returned to the land of their birth to remain there, and their children, the issue of a marriage contracted after their return, and wdio have never been in the United States, have laid claim to our when a lapse of many years have imposed upon them the duty of military service to the only government which had ever known them per sonally. Until the year 1868 it was left em barrassed by the conflicting opinion of courts and jurists to examine how far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance derived from our for mer colonial relations with Great Britain was applicable to American citizens. Congress then wisely swept the doubts away by electing that any * declaration instruction, opinion, order or decision of any officer of this Govern ment which denies, restricts, impairs or ques tions the right of expatriation is inconsistent with the fundamental principle of this Govern ment. But Congress did not indicate in that statute,nor has it since done so, what acts are to be deemed to work expatriation. For my own guidance in determining such questions re quired under the provisions of the Constitu tion, I have required the opinion in writing of the principal officers in each of the executive departments upon certain questions relating to this subject. The result satisfies me that further legislation has become necessary. I therefore commend the subject to the careful consideration of Congress, and 1 transmit herewith copies of the several opinions of the principal officers of the executive depart ments, together with other correspondence and prominent information on the same sub ject. The United States, who led the way in the overthrow of the feudal doctrine of perpetual allegiance, are among the last to indicate how their own citizens may elect another national ity. The papers submitted herewith indicate what is necessary to place us on a par with other leading nations in liberality of legisla tion on this international question. We have already, in our treaties, assented to the prin ciples which would need to be embodied in Jaws intended to accomplish such results. We have agreed that citizens of the United States may cease te be citizens, and may voluntarily render allegiance to other powers. We have agreed that residence in foreign lands with out intent to return, shall of itself work expatriation. We have agreed in some in stances upon the length of time necessary for such intent. I invite Congress now to mark and define, when and how expatriation can be accomplished ; to regulate by law the condi tion ot American women marrying foreign ers ; to fix the status of children born in a foieign country of Arnericpu parents residing more or less permanently abroad, and to make rules for determining such other kindred points a.? may seem best to Congress. THE SIANISH REPUBLIC. In compliance with the request o, Congress I .transmitted to the American Minister at Madrid, with instructions to present it to the Spanish government, the joint resolution ap proved on the 3d of March last, tendering to the people of Spain, in the name and on be half of the American people, the congratula tions of Congress upon the efforts to consoli date in Spain the principles of universal lib erty in a republican form of government. The success of this new republic was inaugurated by striking the fetters from the slaves in Por to Rico. This benefieient measure was fol lowed by the release of several thousand per sons illegally sold as slaves in Cuba. Next the Captain-General of that colony was deprived of the power to set aside the orders of his superior at Madrid which had pertained to the office since 1823 ; the se questered estates of American citizens, which had been the cause of long and frequent cor respondence, were ordered to be restored to their owners. All these liberal steps were taken in the face of violent opposition, di rected by the reactionary slaveholders of Havana, who are vainly striving to stay the march of idtas, have terminated slavery in Cnsistendom. Cuba only excepted. Unhap pily, however, this baneful influence has thus far succeeded in defeating the efforts of all liberal minded men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and in preventing the promise 1 re form in that island. The struggle for political supremacy continues. The pro-slavery aris tocracy in Cuba is gradually arraying itself in more and more open hostility a.nd defiance to the borne Government. While it still maintains a political connection with the republic on the peninsula, although usurping and defying the home government, whenever sucP usurpation or defiance tends in the direction of oppression or of the mam teuance ot abuses, it is still a power in Madrid and recognized by the government. Thus an
