DAKOTA TO THE FRONT. The magnificent display made by Da­ kota at the New Orleans exposition last winter is bearing fruit in many ways. To preserve for history the leading features of the exposition, Hon. Herbert S. Fair all, United States commissioner from Iowa, has prepared a handsomely printed and bound volume of 430 pages, illustra­ tive and descriptive of the great event. In this work eaoh state and territory is treated in separate chapters. The fol­ lowing is a portion of the article relating to Dakota, which is all the more appreci­ ated because it comes from such a close observing oritio as Mr. Fairall, hinmnlf a commissioner from one of the states ranked in competition to Dakota: It has been truly satd that Dakota as a territory is a miracle of western enterprise, and it may be added that her wonderful exhibit at the exposition was a tribute to the pluck and enterprise of "the men who are making her famous. Yery properly the typical Dakotan, H5n. Alexander Mc Kenzie, was chosen the United States com­ missioner. His reputation for earnest, faithful, intelligent work, and love for his territory ranks like Dakota wheat—A No. 1. Mr. McKenzie has been prominent for years in Dakota affairs, and everything lie has touched has bounded into complete success. His central idea was to let the world know of the wonders of Dakota, and that he succeeded was attested by the ad­ miration of the thousands of people who examined his display. The following was the official staff of the Dakota exhibit: Hon. Alexander McKenzie, United States com­ missioner Messrs. R. E. Fleming and M. Grigsby, territorial commissioners Messrs. A. M. Barber, W. H. Leaverett, J. F. Wallace, and W. F. Bur­ rows, assisted by Mr. A. W. Barber, geologist and naturalist. DAKOTA'S EXHIBIT. The Dakota exhibit covered ten thousand one hundred and seventy-five square feet, and was located in the northeastern part of the building. The grand centerpiece of the display was a lofty octagonal tower, twenty feet at the base, splendidly decorated with cereals in handsome designs, and sur­ mounted by an ear of corn formed of six­ teen varieties, fourteen feet high, and bear­ ing a noble eagle. The lofty pinnacle was one of the first features visible as the vis­ itor entered the great hall. The legends on the tower announced, "Dakota has a $75,000,000 school fund," meaning that her school lands are worth that sum at a fair price. Dakota has 75,000,000 acres of free gomeless." overnment land." "Free homes for the There were also statistics of the territory displayed ou one panel. Fronting this tower were two lofty pyra­ mids, one of wheat and one of flour, and between was a smaller one surrounded by a settee. A large corn crib filled to burst­ ing was next, and by it was a most wonder­ ful market display, showing that Dakota ranks the world in vegetables. The de­ partment of hays and grasses was very fine, and bore the legend, Hay and grass make beef," and as a proof a 2,500-pound steer stood in a wealth of grass. At the front end was the bureau of information, handsomely fitted and calculated to satisfy the thousands who sought information in regard to the great great golden north­ west. A feature of the exhibit which aroused much interest among the visitors to this section of the great building was a log cabin, open at one end, the floor covered with furs and rugs, and all available space filled with a throng of intereste^spectators gazing on the rich collections that covered the walls. Specimens of Indian work were shown in great numbers, and derived great interest, aside from their intrinsic beauty, from the fact that they were gath­ ered from the camps of Sioux, the tribe of the turbulent Sitting Bull, and each article bore with it a history. In addition to this display the walls bore specimens of work in polished horn and fruits of the taxider­ mists art. A pair of interlocked antlers told the tale of tragedy on the plains. Mr. W. S. Burrows was in charge of this dis­ play, and was ever ready to explain the in­ teresting features to the inquirers. The characteristics of a wild country were shown in a genuine skin tepee, with an In­ dian family grouped about it, the dusky squaw eugaged in household duties, while the brave had an Indian pony harnessed to a traverse, the most primitive of vehicles— and a boy had a true Indian dog, a cross between a wolf and a domestic canine, har­ nessed to a smaller traverse. Next was a circular park, about forty feet in diameter. It was sodded with new grass and bore growing trees. In the center was a true white buffalo, a nostrare animal, the prop­ erty of Hon. J. J. Hill, president of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba railway. The tiny park was a mass of bewildering curiosities. Bleached buffalo heads, petri­ fications, prairie dogs, elk, deer, antelopes, beaver, skunks, bear, wolves, foxes, coyotes, rabbits, prairie chickens and birds, of all kinds known to the great northwest, occu­ pied the novel and beautiful Dakota park, where more fine specimens illustrative of natural history were found than elsewhere in the exposition.. Next in front of the park was a grand display of geological specimens, and an inspection of these proved a revelation, even to the best in­ formed. A hint at the discovery and ex­ ploration of Dakota was given, by a large and particularly beautiful boat thatched with wheat, typifying the famous voyage of Lewis and Clark, the daring explorers, up the Missouri river. The visitor making his way through the exhibit, was further attracted by the large exhibit of cereals in tall glass cylinders and jars, and surmounted by a mammoth globe containing several bushels. In the whole exhibit of Dakota there were at least eighty bushels of grain in glass. The ef feot produced was like paneling of hard woods of beautiful markings. It Is natural that the pride of Dakota should be her agri­ cultural exhibit, and therefore the wheat capped capitals and pillars covered with cereals, the light tracery ana airy designs worked in wheat heads,-straw and corn, and finally the lofty monument towering above all competitors formed the most strik­ ing features of the «xhibit Not to be out­ done by its sisters of the northwest, Dakota installed a very interesting and creditable mineral display. The Dakota mineral re­ gion is confined to the Black Hills, embrac­ ing a territory of about 160 by 60 miles. Until the year 1877 this territory was part of the Sioux reservation, when it was opened to settlers by General Custer. The rush of prospectors to the Black Hills had, however, becrun earlier than this time, the Inroads of the whites leading to serious Indian wars. In this region were found nearly all the known metals In large deposits, of suffi­ cient size to insure profitable working. The richness of the gold deposits of the Black Hills Is proverbial. One corporation known as'the Home Stakes Syndicate,, maintains 800 stamps, and for the last four years has shipped $200,000 In gold every month. Sam­ ples of .the ore from this company's mines were on exhibit, together with other spec­ imens of gold ore. The silver mines of the Black Hills that were represented by specimens, have produced about §175,000 per month. Copper, too, is found in large quantities. One ledge, from which sam­ ples were shown, is 300 feet wide, the ore averaging 60 per cent pure metal. Mica is produced in great quantities, forming one of the principal industries of the region. Over 300,000 pounds of this mineral have been shipped in the last three years. Tin was discovered about a year ago, and it is claimed that Dakota Is the only place In the United States where this mineral is found in paying quantities. Veins are found averaging from 8% to7£ per cent of pure metal. One company has already invested §1,500,000 in this industry, and others are following. Large quanti­ ties of ore were on exhibit, as were ingots of the refined metal. Immense beds of coal are being discov­ ered in many parts of the territory. The coal is of an inferior grade, but furnishes cheap fuel, and new mines are being opened which promise better qualities. Tvood is found along the Missouri and other streams, and sells In the towns at from $3 to $4 per cord. The exhibit also included specimens of lead, iron, salt, lime, marble, sandstone, plumbago, and uranium, the latter a very valuable mineral not found in paying quantities in any other section of the United States. The side wall which terminated the ex­ hibit space of Dakota W/as decorated in a most artistic manner. The tapestry hang­ ings of maroon formed a rich, warm back­ ground against which to place artistic de­ signs formed of Dakota's chief product, the waving grain. The broad frieze which bordered the top of the wall was composed of a dark green band, on which were grace­ ful designs airly traced iij heads of grain. The principal decorations on the wall be­ low was a huge fan, sketched with lines of wheat and bearing a wheat sheaf as an ornament. On other parts of the wall were pen sketches of prominent public buildings of Dakota, framed with straw. Among the buildings shown were the Da­ kota university, at Vermillion, the school for deaf mutes at Fargo, the hospital for the insane, and several others of almost equal architectural merit. 

TODAY'S telegraph reports will show an excited market, if the judgment of close observers is not wrong. The fluctuations during the past three days have been quick and sharp, being from one to five cents per bushel on all futures. It seems to be the general opinion of those who operate and keep posted that some thing is going to happen. Many look for steady advances, others for a rapid de­ cline from present ruling prices. There is today about an equal division of bulls and bears, who keep the wires warm with orders to buy and sell. War rumors ap­ pear to have less effect on the price of wheat than the Minneapolis millers as­ sociation. The manager of the enter­ prise denies the report that the Minneap­ olis mills will start up, except, perhaps, now and then one to fill small orders and local demand. He still adheres to the ar­ gument that there is "no money" in manufacturing flour to sell at ruling prices, from such high priced wheat and steep freight. The storage capacity for flour is being increased in Minneapolis, notwithstand­ ing the "idle mills." An increased visi­ ble supply, estimated at from 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 bushels, has given the bear ele­ ment some .encouragement, coupled with favorable winter wheat reports and the crowded Russian market, and they may get possession of the market, which they are endeavoring to do with vigorous ef­ forts. 

JUST to remind President Cleveland of the wonderful resources of Dakota, Prof. Molitor, of the Blaok Hills, has for­ warded to Washington a handsome tin brick, extracted from the "Nigger Hill tin ore." It was forwarded by the Wells, Fargo & Co. express, free of charge. The Black Hills Times thus speaks of it: "For the information of the president, the Times would say that although the United States expends upward of $40,000, 000 annually In the purchase of tin bars and plates, practically all of the vast amount is sent abroad, for the reason that the existance of tin in this country was es­ tablished in the last five years, and our mines are as yet only partially developed. Traces of the metal are found in various parts of the country, but the only bodies of ore are found in the Black Hills. The tin "belt" extends from Nigger Hill, on the northwest, to Harney Peak, on the southeast, a distance of sixty miles, and while developments have been confined to the extremities named, It Is believed that the entire zone can be advantageously worked. The Etta company Is erecting large concentrating works at Harney, it being the first plant for the treatment of tin ore ever constructed in the United States. The Nigger Hill prop­ erty is thoroughly developed, showing, practically, a mountain of ore, sufficient to supply the demands of the entire country for years. In many particulars, the dis­ covery of tin in the Hills Is of far greater significance than was the discovery of gold in California. The brick referred to is a fair specimen of American tin, mined by Amer­ ican hands, smelted and moulded by Amer­ ican subjects. The ore from which it was taken carried about 40 per cent of the val­ uable article. Cornwall (England) ore, carrying 5 per cent tin. is considered rich and 2 per cent ore is there handled with profit. A 

WASHINGTON speoial of the 2d says "Every day strengthens the impression that General Logan will be made presi­ dent of the senate. The only matter in dispute is how he shall be elected. The opinion seems to favor the plan proposed by Senator Conger, viz.: Elect a senator pro tern., in order to swear in Logan, and on the following day elect the latter to the chair. It is conceded that the sen­ ate can change the president pro tem. as often as it chooses. Another way would be to adopt the Ferry precedent, and offer a resolution declaring that the oath of office be administered to General Logan, and then declare him elected president pro tem. There is another pre- oedet analagous to the Ferry case, to be found in the thirty-fifth congress. At the speoial session whioh assembled on March 4,1857, the senate passed a reso­ lution directing the oath of office to be administered to Mr. Mason, and that he be declared president pro tem. Mr. Mason had been chosen president pro tem. at the preceding session, but his sen­ atorial term having expired with that ses­ sion, and he having been re-eleoted to the senate, his appointment as president pro tem. was thereby rendered necessary." THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The president's message, while not a brilliant document, shows much researoh on the part of the president, not alone among the cabinet officers, but well in­ formed persons from all parts of the country. The message is voluminous, yet not tiresome because of the multi­ tude of subjects discussed. At the very outset Mr. Cleveland lays down a princi­ ple, which is followed throughout the message, that while it is the duty^and province of the executive to recommend such measures as he may deem expedi­ ent the responsibility for legislative ac­ tion rests with congress. This is an axiom that ought to be observed more generally than it is. The government of the United States is vested in congress— men selected by the people to make laws —and if that body is not what it should be the people are at fault, not the presi­ dent or the party. It is fair to assume, generally, however, that the average con­ gressman is as good as the people who elect him. Our foreign relations occupy a large portion of the president's mes­ sage, and that the United States main­ tains friendly relations with all govern­ ments is fully demonstrated. The tariff question, the president handles with gloves, and neither the tariff or anti-tariff advocate can take exceptions. In fact there is a lack of positiveness throughout the message, except on the civil service question, that is calculated not to offend. Ou the civil service question the presi­ dent reiterates his former sentiments which are strongly in favor of an exten­ sion of the alleged reform and an in rease of pay for the members of the com­ mission. The ward politician and party worker is given a terrible slap in the face by President Cleveland in the follow­ ing words: "Experience in this administra­ tion will probably suggest amendments of the methods of its'execution, but I ven­ ture the hope that we shall never again be remitted to the system which distributed public positions purely as rewards for partisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our government could well survive the strain of a continuance of this system, which, upon every change of administra­ tion, inspires an immense army of claim­ ants for office to lay siege to the patronage of the government, engrossing the time of public officers with their importunities, spreading abroad the contagion of disap­ pointment and filling the air with the tumult of their dis­ appointment. The civil service does not prevent the discharge of the indolent or incompetent, but it does prevent sup­ plying his place with an unfit party work­ er." On the money question and a sound banking system, the president is sound, and his suggestions, many of them ought to receive consideration. While believ­ ing in the extension of coast surveys, the president believes in transfering the work from the interior to the navy department and* the management of the Indian af­ fairs, the president thinks should be left, to a great extent, to a commission of six, authorized by act of congress, three of whom shall be appointed from the army. The improvement of nature's highways receives the favorable consideration of the executive, and a law of congress is recommended prohibiting the construc­ tion of bridges over navigable waters in such a manner as to interfere with navi­ gation. In this connection, the new rail­ road bridge over the Mississippi is cited as especially obnoxious and antagonistic to river interests. A more effective navy and additional coast defense are also rec­ ommended, and in the detail of sugges­ tions, the message may be said to be one of the most exhaustive ever written. 

BISMARCK WEEKLY TRIBUNE: FRIDAY, DEC. H, 1885. An. other feature of the message is the un­ questionable evidences throughout that the document was written by the presi­ dent himself. COMMITTEEMAN DAY, patronage dis­ penser for Dakota, is again in Washington, yet upon the day of his arrival the fol­ lowing dispatch is sent out: "The question of who shall be the next governor of Dakota has finally been solved, and Barney Caulfield will doubtless be the successful candidate. The situation at present Is: The president wants Mr Caul field and Secretary Lamar wants Mr. Zie­ bach, so that between these two Governor Pierce will probably remain." 

MINNEAPOLIS TBIBUNE: If the state­ ment is true that the president bas no in­ tention of removing Governor Pierce un­ til his term has expired, the administra­ tion has scored one white mark which no one can fail to. see. Governor Pierce is an honeBt man, an efficient officer, and thoroughly acquainted with the duties of his office, and the needs of the territory. 

THEBE ought to be some organized movement lodking to proper representa­ tion to Secretary Lamar, of the injustice of Commissioner Sparkd' recent rulings. A Fargo dispatch of yesterday says: "It has been supposed that the land depart­ ment would not insist upon the reversal of the uniform practice involved in the reoent decision in the case at Devils Lake denying settlers the right to make both homestead and pre-emption, but the Fargo land office has today received in­ structions from Commissioner Sparks, enforoing the new ruling and requiring the claimant to make affidavit that he has not secured the claim by commuting un­ der either of the laws. This will work hardships and injustice to thousands of settlers." THE Burleigh county agricultural so­ ciety was organized January 1, 1882. The original members were as follows: Robert Macnider, R. B. Mason, J. A. Field, W. B. Thurston, David Stewart, Tlios. Gilbert, A. W. Cameron, N. Falconer, John Satterlund, Jolln Pollock, Louis Nattmeyer, Oscard Ward, George Hay, John F. Wallace, Sr., E. M. Fuller, I. H. Saulsbury, W. S. Bennett, John Boyle, Henry Falconer, Wni. Thompson, Henry Suttle, Daniel Manning. The present assets may be summed up as follows: A good record, two banners, and $25 in the treasury. It is now de­ sired to extend the usefulness of this or­ ganization by infusing new blood and capital, and making all necessary ar­ rangements for the holding of annual county and district fairs hereafter, the first one some time next year. Now is the time to perfect the new organization, and to that end it should be the province of every citizen, not only to talk about it, but to be present at the preliminary meet­ ing called for next Saturday, December 12th, at the city hall. 

COMMISSIONEB SPARKS, of the general land office, has promulgated the follow­ ing important order, modifying his order of April 30th last, to suspend final action on issue of patents on settlement and im­ provement claims for examination with respect to compliance with the law. The order of April 2,1885, is modified as fol­ lows: The commissioner will certify and re­ quest the issue of patents upon all entries not subject to reasonable doubt. First—In contests where the rights of successful parties have been established. Second—Where examinations have been made by government agents, and no fraud appears. Third—Homestead entries where resi­ dence, improvement and cultivation have been made according to law, and a board, to consist of the assistant commissioner, chiei cjerk and chief law clerk, is hereby organized to pass upon and report said cases to the commissioner. SMITH D. FBY, the "John Smith" of the Dakota press, writes a personal let­ ter reaffirming the declaration of his telegram, that the letter recently pub­ lished in the TBIBUNE, purporting to have written by him under the nom de plume of "John Smith" was a forgery. This, the TBIBUNE was satisfied was the case, upon receipt of the telegram, but the personal letter adds to the assertion. Mr. Fry, of course, feels considerably in­ jured, and is anxious to find out who the guilty party is. Mr. Fry knows as much about it as the TBIBUNE. MARQUIS DE MOBES has gone to New York, and expects to visit France before he returns to Medora, in February. He denies all reports of financial troubles. He has a steady income from an estate that can not be encumbered. Financ ial embarrassment is an absolute impossi­ bility. He has done much toward the development of western Dakota, and pro­ poses to continue the various enterprises he is now engaged in. He will, however, concentrate his enterprises in Medora. THE next number, or the one following, of the Northwest, will contain an article descriptive and illustrative of Fargo. Col. Lounsberry is now in that city pre­ paring the matter, and is said to be meet­ ing with sucoess. Col. Lounsberry is an excellent descriptive writer, and that the illustrations will be of a superior order is demonstrated by the last issue of the Northwest in which Portland, Oregon, was so graphically illustrated. THE Fargo Bepublican comes out in the following rather plain language: "Immigration Commissioner Dunlap is getting it hot from all sides. It required gall to divert the funds of the territory to the publication of division boom pam­ phlets, but Dunlap has done it. Gov. Pierce should protect the taxpayers by putting it out of Dunlap's power to make such misuse of their money." AJJXI over the southern half of the ter­ ritory artesian wells are being sunk, and wonderful sucoess attaches to each. At Columbia Mr. Swan has just finished one, the flow of whioh exceeds that of any other in the world. The pressure is 185 pounds to the square inch, and the flow 240,000 barrels per day, THE TBIBUNE is advised that the at­ tack made upon Col. Wm. Thompson in the St. Paul Globe some weeks ago, was probably by one Austin, Washington correspondent of that paper. Those who attributed the attack to "John Smith" were therefore in error. AT THE military fair at Yankton, Maj. Hinman was voted an elegant sword for being the most popular member of the militia. Had the major remained in Bismarck he would have received a sword with a gold sheath. THE enterprise exhibited by the Re­ publican in giving an extended synopsis of the president's message by wire on the day it was delivered, ought to be ap­ preciated by the people of Fargo. 

SECBETABY MCCOBMACK will assume the duties of his office at enoe, Mr. Tel­ ler, his predecessor, having oome up from Yankton for the purpose of turning over the records of the office to him. Capt. MoCormack^s warmly greeted by his many Bismarck friends, regardless of party. The satisfaction of the citizens of Bismarck with Capt. McCormack's ap­ pointment is only equalled by that of the residents of all other portions of the territory. His appointment gives uni­ versal satisfaction. THE new route from St. Paul and Min­ neapolis to the southwest is being repre­ sented in the northwest by J. A. Mac gregor, traveling agent of the Minnesota & Northwestern. Among the other ad­ vantages this road offers is its fast trains to St. Louis, making the run in twenty three hours. The new route was opened last Monday, and its elegant day coaohes and Pullman sleepers have been well filled every day since that time. Ray­ mond DuPuy is general superintendent and H. M. Littell general passenger agent. If for no other reason, this route should become popular, for it has John L. Whelan as general ticket agent in St. P-aul. Years ago Mr. Whelan was one of the most .popular newspaper men in Chi­ cago. He is a hard worker, a ready talker, and can write as fast as he can talk. For along time he was an associ­ ate of the editor of this paper, who, per­ haps better than any one else, knows his sterling worth. For some time past he has been connected with the Kankakee route, out of Chicago. THE Wells, Fargo & Co. express an­ nounce! the final completion of their new money order system. The Bismarck office, as well as over 8,000 other cities in the United States, has the authority to is­ sue these orders, which will prove of great benefit to business firms apd trav­ eling men. The rates of sending money from one place to another is about the same as the government charges for postoffice orders, and the sender has the advantage of being able to obtain the or­ ders at any time during the day or even­ ing when the office is open. These or­ ders can be deposited in banks can be remitted in letters as exchange upon the large cities of the east and west, and are safer than money for the traveler. Un­ der this system strangers can be identi­ fied without annoyance. The sender re­ tains his receipt for his money, and, if orders are lost, immediate reclamation can bo made. AND the 

TBIBUNE wishes, also, to say a good word for Mr. Dickerson, who so ably handles the St. Paul end of the as­ sociated press, which everybody in the northwest now depends upon for the news of the day. While William Henry Smith, the prime mover and ruler of the associated press, is to be congratulated in general, his subordinates, such as Dickerson, are en­ titled to credit in particular, and the tel­ egraph company is also doing well, not­ withstanding it keeps the newspapers rustling to pay the weekly tolls, and keep the operators good natured, so that "30" will come—not too soon. COMMISSIONER SPABKS in October last issued a very important order, which has never been published except in Walla Walla, Washington territory, which, if enforced, will cause a panic throughout the entire northwest, and wherever pub­ lic lands are being located. If enforced, this order will cause a panic among local banks in the northwest, and will produce a finanoial panic that will retard the set­ tlement and growth of that part of the country. It is directly contrary to the uniform ruling of the interio^department, and adverse to the decision of the su­ preme court. THE recent decision of the supreme court ®f the United States in the North­ ern Pacific tax case will be a disappoint­ ment to a large number of purchasers of tax certificates issued by various counties along the line. In Morton county last year the JiTorthern Paoific lands were sold for taxes, and a large number of purchasers were in attendance. A few years ago the lands were offered for sale in Burleigh county but there were but few who believed in the validity of the tax therefore, few tax title fiends will be losers in this county. THE Pioneer Press and other papers seem to be in error in stating that con­ gress may not confirm the appointment of Commissioner Sparks. He has, sorry for the northwest, already been con­ firmed, the event transpiring March 25th last. However, some move must be made to secure his removal or a curb put on his rulings. If allowed to continue in the course he is now pursuing, a mighty disaster awaits the whole northwest. EVEN the St. Paul Globe (democratic) says the crowning act of General Logan's life was his refusal to take the presidency of the senate, unanimously tendered him by the republicans. The Globe takes the view that political enemies expected to shelve the Illinois senator by thin move. THE iron and steel market is brisk, and the prices rapidly advancing. This is a convincing argument of better times, and extensive railroad building next spring. 

SENATOR HARRIS,of Tennessee, received the complimentary nomination at the hands of the democrats, for president pro tem. of the senate. THE Grand Forks university manage­ ment have made a report which the Plaindealer considers-very creditable. IfBWa \OTES A2TD COXMEXTS. The November fire loss, in the United States and Canada was $7,600,000. The use of petroleum as a fuel on Rus­ sian railroad lines is almost general. Archdeacon Farrar believes in high li­ cense as a corrective of the liquor traffic. Carlisle was elected speaker of the house by a vote of 177 to 137 for Reed, republican. Minneapolis Journal: The president's message will suit every body but his own party. Edwin Booth has never seen any one play Hamlet" since, as a.mere boy, he saw his father in that character. Next Easter Shnday falls on the 25th of April, a fact which has not occurred since 1734, and will not occur again before 1943. Col. Ingersoll said of Hendricks: What a democrat lie was As I heard one of the boys put it, "He was a yard wide and more under water." An Aberdeei? dispatch says': The citi­ zens and voters in this vicinity are much opposed to the appointment of Harris as register of the land office here, Harris be­ ing from Vicksburgh, Miss. Democrats are dissatisfied. Estelline Bell: A report from Fargo says that "some of the cattle now being shipped from the Missouri river country are afflicted with the big jaw." This trou­ blesome disease has been epidemic in the Dakota legislature for many years, and now it seems it is spreading to the cattle. An autograph hunter recently applied to General Sherman for his autograph and a lock of his hair." He received the fol­ lowing reply: I regret to state that, as my orderly is bald, and as the man who formerly wrote my autographs is dismissed, I can not comply with your request." A Washington dispatch of the 7th says: M. H. Day and F. M. Ziebach will leave for home Thursday. Day will return about New Year for the winter. Now that the Senate is in session, it seems settled that Pteroe will not be removed as governor of Dakota. Dennis Hannifin, of Bismarck, joined the Dakota colony today. A deserter named Jesse Riley, from com­ pany F, eleventh infantry, stationed at Fort Lincoln, was arrested in Chicago. No­ vember 27th, and delivered to the military authorities. He had served five years at Fort Yates, and only re-enlisted a short time ago. He asserts that he overstaid his leave while drunk, and had no intention of deserting. New York World, Dec. 5: The publish­ ers of Gen. Logan's book, entitled "A Great Conspiracy," are now preparing a pros­ pectus to be used by their agents in can­ vassing. The preface states that Gen. Lo­ gan has spent many years in collecting au­ thentic material for the book, and a large portion of his spare time during the last two years has been used lu preparing it. It then gives a brief sketch of Logan's careei. The book is to be.issued in the spring, and will be in one volume octavo, and will con­ tain about 600 pages. Senator Dolph's bill, introduced in the senate, to repeal the timber culture, pre­ emption and desert land acts, provides that in place of these modes of entering lands, all persons entitled under thfe laws to make a homestead entry shall be entitled to enter a section or less of desert or mountainous lands. Desert, or mountainout lands are defined as all lands, exclusive of timber and mineral lands, which will not produce agricultural crops without irrigation, and lands which are so mountainous and rough that they can not be plowed or cultivated. It further provides that any tract of which three-fourths is desert or mountainous shall be desert or mountainous land. Fargo Republican: Governor Hill, of New York, in a recent interview, declared that his late victory is a censure of the pol­ icy being pursued by President Cleveland. Further, that it demands that a Jacksonian policy, in the matter of spoils, shall be fol­ lowed. He plainly admits that republicans must go, and that the retention of them is a mistake, and all appointments recom­ mended by republicans should be, in fact, distrusted. Probably had Mr. Hill given voice to these sentiments immediately af­ ter his election, the terms in which he was congratulated by President Cleveland would have been less fervid—possibly no congratulatory dispatch would ever have been written.
