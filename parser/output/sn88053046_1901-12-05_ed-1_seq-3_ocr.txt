Oun is high. We do not desire to do for the Islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics—to make lliem fit for self government after the fashion of tho really free nations. History may safely be challenged to show a single Instance in which a master ours, having been forced take posses thirty generations to achieve another of hand, especially when start very far ancestors had thirty generations ago. In th* by tho exigencies of alien land, has behaved inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for th«>lr progress that In the Philippines. To leave tho islands at this tlmo would mean that they would ifall Into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such a desertion of duty on our part would be u crime against humanity.

To have taken a single step farther or faster In advance would have been folly and wenkness and might well huve been crime.

But It may well bo that In certain cases it will havo to bo withdrawn be cause the inhabitants show themselves unfit to exercise it. Such Instances have already occurred. In other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the opposite direc tion. There are still troubles ahead in the is lands.

These laws will give free play to Industrial enterprise, and tho commercial development which will surely follow will afford to (he people of tho Islands the best proofs of the sincerity of desire to aid them. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to points In Asia.

In other words, the Monroe doctrine Is a dec laration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any American power on American soil.

The congress should provide means whereby It will bo possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regu lars and. If possible, also a division of ^onal guardsmen once a year. These erclses might take tho form of field neuvers, or if on tho gulf coast or the Pa cific or Atlantic seaboard or in the region of tho great lakes the army corps when assembled could be marched from inland point to some point on the water, thero embarked, disembarked after a plo of days' Journey at some other point and again marche«l inland.

Tho Interest shown by many commercial bodies throughout the country in th* reorganization of the ice is heartily commended to your atten tion. Several bills providing for a consular service been submitted to tho congress. They based upon tho Just principle that ap pointments to the service should be made ( only after a practical test of the appli- j fcant'e fitness; that promotions should be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability ; nnd zeal in tho performance of duty, and that the tenure of offleo should be unaf- ; ! , rapidly expanding foreign commerce, tho ; protection of American citizens resorting ; foreign countries in lawful pursuit of I thelr affairs and tho maintenance of tho i dignity of the nation abroad combine to ; make it essential that our consuls should of character, knowledge and en terprlse. It is true that tho service is now In the main efficient, but a standard oi j excellence cannot be permanently main talned until the principles set forth in tin | bills heretofore submitted to the congresi ' this subject are enacted into law. I In iny judgment the tifne has arrived j when we should definitely make up out minds to recognize the Indian as an Indl- | vidual nnd not ns u member of a tribe. | The general allotment act is a mighty i pulverizing engine to break up the tribal lt acts directly upon the family and the Individual. Under Its provisions Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should ^ >w break up the tribal funds, doing for J them what allotment does for tho tribal ! lands—that Is, they should be divided Into Individual holdings. There will be a tran- | sitlon period during which the funds will be held in trust. This also with tho lands. A stop organized ! : i recent years fected by partisan considerations.

The people of Charleston, with great en ergy an«] civic spirit, are carrying on an ! exposition which will continue throughout , mt>st of the present session of the con ; gress. I heartily commend this expos! tlon to the good will of the people. It ! deserves all the encouragement that can j be given It The managers of the Charles ton exposition have requested the cabinet officers to place thereat the government ( exhibits which have been at Buffalo, ; promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken the responsibility of direct ing that this be done, for I feel that it Is due to Charleston to help her In her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the j management should not be required to 1 Pay all these expenses. I earnestly | ommend that the congress appropriate at ; once tho small sum necessary for this purpose. The Pan-American exposition at Buffalo bas just closed. Both from the industrial and the artistic standpoint this exposition has been In a high degree creditable and useful not merely to Buffalo, but to the United States. The terrible tragedy of the president's assassination Interfered mate Hally with Its being a financial success. The exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy, be cause it represented an effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of the western hemisphere and gWe them an in creasing sense of unity. Such an effort a genuine service to the entire Amer lean nubile v _ , ' _ _ _ Science and Education. The advancement of the highest inter ot national science and learning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results of scientific «xpeditions conducted by the United States have been committed to the Smithsonian institution, In furtherance of Its declared purpose— for the "Increase and diffusion of knowl edge among men''—the congress has from time to time given it other Important functions. Such trusts have been cuted by the Institution with notable fidel ity. There should be no halt in the work of the Institution, In accordance with the plans which Its secretary has presented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North American animals in the National Zoological park. The urgent needs of the National museum •ommended to the favorable consideration •of the congress. Perhaps the most characteristic edu cational movement of the past fifty years is that which has created the modern public library and developed It into broad and active service. There 6.000 public libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In addition accumulating mnterial. they are also striving by organization, by improvement In method and by co-operation to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of its ad ministration. In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the federal library, which, though still the library of congress and entitled, is the one national library of the United States. Already the largest single collection of books on tho western hemisphere and certain to Increase more rapidly than any other through purchase, ex«*hange and the operation of the copy right law, this library has a unique oppor tunity to render to the libraries of this country—to American scholarship—service of tho highest importance.
