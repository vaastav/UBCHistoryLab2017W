STATE DEP'T IS AWAITING WORD FROM MEXICO CITY Washington. Dec. 2. A diversified legislative programme to restore a peace time business status, revise the tax schedules, curb unrest, reduce the cont of living and rectify labor and larmlng conditions was recommended by President Wilson today in his mes sage to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws based on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the. world, sug gested that the income and excess profits tax schedules be simplified, ad vocated steps to improve rural con ditions and promote production, and declared ?. democratiration of indus try" to protect both labor and cap ital. The railroad problem he reserved for a future message, and he made no statement of his intentions regarding the peace treaty or Mexico. Many of his recommendations were the same as those submitted to the special session last spring and several of them are mbraced in legislation already being formulated in the two houses. To meet the cost of living the presi dent asked exlenlion of the war time 'rod control bill, federal regulation f co'd storage, readjustment of food transportation, and establishment of a system 0f fedora! licencing for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce. He declared the causes of unrest to be superficial and temporary and made his only reference to the senate's failure to ratify the peace treaty in taying that restlessness was due largely to the nation's hesitation in determining its peace policy. The federal government, be declared should be armed with full authority to deal in the criminal courts with those who iromote' violence. In an extended decision of iabor ondillons he declared the worlrers isd just cause for complaint in manyj nui.ers. ami ma mere snoum oc a 'fuli recognition 'if the right of those ae work, in whatever rank, to par ticipate In some organized way in -very decision that directly affects holr welfare." ' . He asserted that the right of indi viduals to strike must lie held invio late, but ndded that tber must be a firm stand taken against "the attempt by anl class to usurp a power that miiy government Itself has right 10 ex rclse as a protection to all." I'lnul T he suggests the establishment of a rihunal for peaceful decision of in imtria! disputes. He renewed his recommends Uon for t budget system of national finances, isked for special projection To pro net the dyeatuffH and chemical in iustries. and deelard the administra tion bill providing farms for soldiers 'hsuld he passed without delay. The message, about 5.(100 words in fifth, whs tranxmlitcd to the eapitol V messenger, the president cxpress ng regret that hi health would not lermit his del'vcry of it in person. It1 was read separately in senate and I liouse where It drew mixed expres sion! of approbation and disappoint ment. The democratic side generally praised it as setting forth decisively a definite programme of reform while on the republican side there were I many complaints that it lacked def niteness and omitted mention of important problems 

TEXT OF MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: F sincerely rref that I cannot be qresent at the opening of this session or tne congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as ! could wish the many question" that aha pressing for solution at this time. Happily I have the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept In close touch with affairs in their de tail and whose thoughtful recom mendations I earnestly second. Budget System is Recommended. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of th.ir affairs, growing out of federal control. I shall take the liberty at a later day of ad dressing you. I hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this season legislation looking to the establishment of a bud- t j-im. i rmi mere snouia ne one finale authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not in dependently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan or expenditure properiy related .o tne nation s income there can v no doubt. I believe the burden of pre raring the budset must, in the nature of tne case, if the work is to he nrnn- frly done and responsibility concen trated instead of divided, rest upon Ihe executive. The budget so prepared should be m 'emitted to and approved ind amended by a single committee li ticn i.ou.-- or congress ana no sin gle appropriation should be made bv he congress, except such, as may hare beer, included in the budget pre nared by the executive or added bv the particular committee of congress barfed with the budget legislation Another and not less important as pect of the problem is the ascertain ment of the economy and efficiency with wriich the moneys appropriated -re expended Under existing laws the em'J audit f-i for the purpose of iswertainlig mhether expenditures hae been lawfully made within the appropriations. . No one is authoris d or equipped to ascertain whether he.gaoney has bee:-1 spnt wisely, econ atitallv and effectively. Tb -duitori should l ii is li i train ed officials with permanent tenure in the treasury department, tree of ob ligations to, or motives of consider ation for this or any subsequent ad ministration, and authorized and em powed to examine into and make re port upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the government. Their reports should be made to the congress ajid to the secretary of the treasury. Future Taxation. I trust that the congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplifi cation of the Income and profits tax es and become an immediate neces sity. These taxes performed in despensable service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to sav the taxpayer incon venience and expense, but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite. With reference to the details of the revenue law. the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of in ternal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable in con nectlon with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support. It is of the ut most importance that In dealing with this matter the present law should be disturbed so far as regards taxes ft? the calendar year 1920, payable in the calendar year 182.1. The congress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profit tax es can in peace times be effective ly productive of revenue and whether they may not. on the contrary, be destructive of business aetivilv and productive of waste and inccicieney. i ncre is a point at winch in peace times high rates of income and of prolts taxes discourages energy, re (Continued On Page 3, Column 4)

Washington, Dec. 2. With much impatience the slate department today awaited word from Mexico City of the release of Consular Agent Jenkins from ihe penitentiary at Puebia in response to the government's second sharp note to Carranze. The department tonight had not been advised of the note's delivery, but offi cials said it probably was presented during the day and that they expected prompt action by the Carranza admin istration in acceding to the request" of the United States. The note was forwarded early Sunday and a delayed despatch from the Mexican capital said the Mexican foreign office an nounced late last night that it had not been received. Errors in cable trans mission were said to have delayed its presentation. A new sidelight on the general Mexi can kidnapping situation was given to-, day in a report of the recent capture of Norman Rowe, a British subject, by rebels at Zacatecas. who held him tor ransom, but who quickly released him at the instance of the Carranza ad ministration, without payment of ransom-Great Britain never recognized the Carranza regime in Mexico. The British vice consul at Zacatecas promptly notified the Mexican authori ties and reported the kidnapping to the British consulate general at Mex ico City. Representations were quick ly made to the Mexican government and within a few hours the machinery, including the military, was seeking to rescue Rowe. The kidnapping took place at t'res nilio, a large mining carav at Zacate cas, and in reporting the liVration and return of Rowe to FresnilN the vice consul said: "The government troops ant? the state authorities exercised all diligence in effecting the liberty of Rowe. and as a mere matter of justice this should be stated, as everything is due to the efficacy with which the authorities moved in the matter." i.uis '.

The career of Mr. Frick, one of the most fascinating chapters In the his tory of industrial' America ended without warning at five o'clock this morning, when only Oscar Rodgers, the financier's butler was at his bed side. Awaking, Mr. Frick asked for a drink of water and hcving swal lowed it, lay back on his pillow. "I think I will go to sleep," he murmured. These were his last words. Failing; to arouse his master, the butler sum moned members of the family, who had retired, not expecting a fatal torination to Mr. Frick a illness. Those who gathered around the death bed, besides Mrs. Frick, were the iron master's daughter, Miss Helen Frick and his son and daughler-in-iaw, Mr. and Mrs. Childs Frick. Announcement of Mr. Frick's death several hours later brought messages of condolence from all parts of United States. A host of friends, bearing flowers, hastened to call upon the be reaved family', but only the most in timate were admitted. Tonight tribute was paid by the men iwth whom and against whom he had waged financial war. Only from Alexander Berkman, the anarchist who in the days of the great Home stead strike, had attempted to assas sinate the financier, came a taunt.

RECORD OF CRIME OF BANDIT "BILL" CARLISLE Rawlins. Wyo., Dec. 2. The Union Pacific train roober, William L. Car lisle, who held up the passengers bt the Log Angeles limited on its way through Wyoming on Tuesday. Nov ember 18, and has since kept sheriff's posses on the jump searching for him) betrays a rare contradiction in charac ter. Armed with a revolver and facing a car full of passengers or twisting and turning to elude the sheriff's posse, he became a daring criminal. In prison, he knitted sweaters for soldiers and bought Liberty bonds with the money ho. earned from manufacturing small articles for sale. Ills boldness has startled and alarm ed not only the passengers he robbed but the authorities who hyve endeav ored to apprehend him. Even while troops were hunting for him he en tered a telegraph office to send a message to the Union Pacific officials, thanking them for the "contributiri" he had collected from the passengers on the last train he robbed. It is said that he even entered a newspaper of fice, asked for news about the search for himself, read the despatches and vanished. One of his peculiarities is to an nounce when engaged in a holdup that l am not robbing women, children, old men, soldiers or sailors," but he went through the pockets of all other passengers without compunction. Carlisle was sentenced to prison here on May 11. 1916. after a spoctac ular career in the previous winter in which he robbed several Union Pacific trains. He was taken prisoner .in April. 1916 the day after he had held up a Union Pacific train near Hanna. Two days later he was convicted. He told his captors. "I am not a killer." It is said that from his hid ing place in the brush he might have slain many of the posse to which he surrendered.

To the present not an industry has been shut down in Pittsburgh fos lack of coal, but from points nearby toiiay eanie reports of fuel shortage. One big mill at Sharon, Pa., was said to be without coal. Plants of the Unit ed States Steel Corporation, however, were reported as being able to operate for weeks to cbnie.

The ship per explained a "mistake, had been made" and no further action was taken. Assistant District Attorney S. M Russell, of Louisville, in the U.
