It will bs recollected that some time ftiaco mob of negroes and abolition ists, headed by a Rev. Mr. Gordon, Treaident of the Iberia College, tarred and feathered and whipped a Deputy IT. S.

Recently this professed Minister was' tried iu the United States Court at Cleveland, and fined f 364 and costs, and imprisoned sis month ia the jail. The abolition ists are raising a terrible howl over the punishment, but all good law-abiding citizens will say, served him biout! More anon. ' much attenjiou to tho proclamation of emancipation. ' . ' We learn from several sources that when it was yet unknown in Washing ton what course the President was a- bout to take upon the emancipation question, the deepest feeling prevailed among the Union members of Congress from the border slave States. The most prominent among them wero open in their declarations, that an emancipa tion policy would instantly throw their States into the Southern Confederacy, annihilate the Federal troops, and ut- j terly crush out all Union feeling among them. Yet, notwithstanding these as-j surances, tho extreme men of tho Re publican party aye acting precisely as if they desired to inaugurate the hor rors which these border State men arc laboring to avert. The leading Republican papers, too, are full of suppressed bitterness at the President's modification of Cameron's report. The ablest of them, tho Now York Evening Tost, says ' theof mes sage that: "Nothing in this message speak to the popular heart; nothing in it seems up to the spirit of tho times; no sententious utterances of great truths are there to stir the public wind in the midst of trial and calamities." The Cincinnati Gazette, too, the leading Republican paper of Cincinna ti, takes sides with Cameron, and says: "The document, as originally prepared, is thus accidentally laid before the cublic, and we have now given the modifications. While. the cause of ;his disagreement is to be I dcplorod, inasmuch as its exhibits a de&cicn I cy on the part of the President that was not to be expected, the occurrence by which the ' people tiave I een made aware of the position of Mr. Lincoln and members o! his Cabinet is not to be regretted.

CAUCUS OX BATUEDAV STIUUT. The baa beeii no little curiosity excited among Republicans and Democrats, to-day, to know all about ths caucus of Republican member of Congress, held. last night at the Capitol. "The 'limn will have the only ac count of it. - Theft is unquestionably a wide difference of opinion" on tho recommendations of the Fwsident in regard to slavery. A portion of the Republican 'are emphatically opposed to the message, and are prepared to vute a censure ol ths policy of (he l'reidet.

The resolution was advocsted by the Chairman; who contended he waa expressing the feejing of the people, when, be said if waj ths duty of tho people to press on tho Gov ernment the imperative necessity of vindica ting the honor and dignity of the British name and flag. . Mr. J no. Campbell c isidered there was reason to doubt whether the facts related and acted on by this meeting, were, in reali ty, a breach of international law, and re 'erred to opinions of law officers of the crown as be ing in some measure inclined to show that such s step as taken with respect to South ern Commissioners, was justifiable under the existing state of international law, and urged the propriety ol postponing the consideration of the subject till to morrow. , Mr. Tow sustained Mr. Campbell's views. ltie ctiurman sues'ed that to meet tho objection of Mr. Campbell to strike out the words, "by requiring prompt reparation for this outrage," and thus amend the resolution passed almost unanimously... . v Several merchants expressed . their 'views after the adjournment that the meeting ' and its action wus prematura The London Times is more moderate in its remarks than the News. . While denying that the Federal government, on its own po sition that the existing war is a mere rebell ion, has a right to overhaul neutral ships, it nevertheless admits that England herself has establishedprecedeuls which now tell against her in the matter ol the Trent, but those pre cedent vrcra made under circumstances very different, ',, . It asserts that from those which now oc cur, England was then fighting for existence, and did in those days what she would, not do nor allow others to do. In discussing the question whether Mason and Slide)! were ;)(-,, able to capturo as belligerents or contrabands on board the Tron', the Times states that it is the opinion of very, jpmiuent jurist,", that this was pot the question to be adjusted by ihc boat's crew. . The legal course would have been to take the ship itself into port for adjudication. "'. . It concludes with the expression (hat Englishmen will discuss tho question with calmness; and appeals to the Federal States, not to proVoks s war by subjects. . The above is the telegraphic acccount of the news from England in. relation to the taking of Mason and Slidell from the British steamer. The papers brought by tho same stea mer give the following interestincr de tails of tho account by the Purser of the British steamer, and also the opinions of the leading British papers concern ing this affa;r: rrem the 1 urscr a statement wo ex'ract as follows: We left Havana ycFterdriy morning at eight Thu morning, ah'Mit h it past eleven, we ob- scived a Iai(e sieanithip ahead, and on a nearer approach lonnd . she was hove to, evidently awaiting ,. us. We were then in the nairowest part of the liuhaiua Channel, nbroist ol Pari edon Uiinde light, house.

We were now suffi iently nam o observe that all her ports were open, guns run out, and crew a, their stations. On a s ill neaier sppniach she fired a shell from s swivel gun of large cahbte on her forecas.le, which parsed with in s few yaids ol the ship, bursting about a hundred bard to leeward. ; We were now within hail, when Capt. Moir, commanding this ship, asked the American what he meant by stopping his ship, and why he did so by filing shotted puns, contrary to usual custom. The lepiy was that he wished to send a boat on board of us. This was imrrediatoly followed by a boat pushing off Iroin the side ol me aan Jacinto, containing bo i ween twenty and thirty - men, heavily armed, under the command of the first lieu tenant, who came up on ths quarter dock, and, after asking for Captain Moir. demanded a list of his passengers., As his "right of search" was denied, toe in!ormaiion required was, of Course, , peremptorily refused. He then stated he had inforuutkin that Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Euslissnd Macfarland were on board, and demanded that thoy should be ?;iven op. This also being indignantly re used, Mr. Slidell himscll came forward and said that the four gentlemen named were then before him, but appealed to the British tlag under which be waa tailing (or proteo lioa. ; " " The liutenant laid that his orders were to take tbem On board the San Jacinto by force ltiney would not surrender, tie. then walk ed to the side of the ship and waved bis hand immediately three more heavily aimed boats pushed on and surrounard the snip, and the party of marines who came in the first boat came up ana took posesston or the quarter deck; those, however, he ordered down oa the main deck, to take charge of the gangwuy ports.

Ol conrse, not the slightest notice was taken of either order, nor did they at tempt to enforce them. Ak JvIportas'T Al'Jttssi'tK The London Star has litis statement: ."Tlie ev'tnt has not been unanticipated. It was, indeed, expec ted to have come off en this side Of tho At lantic. It is notorious that Federal ships have left our own ' ports to watch for the mail steamer, With. the deliberate intention of tak ng fiom her the commissioners. The opinion of the law officers of our Crown has been taken on the subject, and we are assu red thot it is clearly in favor of the right as sumed by the United Statos government. Lounox Times os the Seizcbh. it ?e- quires s strong effort of self restraint to dis cuss with coolness the intelligence wo now publish. An English mail steamer, sailing undor tho British flig, and carrying letters and passengers from a Spanish port to En gland, has been stopped on the high seas and overhauled. Four of the passengers have been taken out and carried off as prisoners, claiming, and vainly claiming, as they were being forced away, th'e protection of the flag or Great Britain. Tboso are the naked facts. We put out ol sight the accident that the four gentlemen thus kidnapped were accredited with a diplomatic'missioniwi the Conf'Aer ate Siatti nf America to the Courtt of Europe, and also the peremptory manner in which the Federal frigate acted in making her sci xure.i -i ' ' Is il, then, true that every officer of the American. navy can stop and overhaul our ships wherever thoy may be found, and ea.n take out ol them any .person wnotn ma may claim to be citizemrofrthe United 8taesor officers of tEe Confederate Government?

Now, if this were, so, it is clear that the red eral States of America have, in s'opping our mail steamer, been guilty ol an act of aggres sion which could only be propeily punished bv' laying an embargo on every American ship in liriusn ports ana sweeping tncir lit tie navy from the 'seas.i- . ...
