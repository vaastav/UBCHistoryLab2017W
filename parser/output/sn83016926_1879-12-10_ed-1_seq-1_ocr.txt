Lewis: 1H:au Sir I notice in the Democrat-Star of the Hist inst., a call for a public meeting composed of citizens of the three seaboard counties of your State, to be held at Scran ton, on Thursday, the 27th inst., to take into consideration such action a will effec tually prevent in the future the maiming and killing of stock by the New Orleans and Mobile Railroad. This evil, now for the first time sought to be remedied, by the or ganized action of the people of the counties bordering on the seashore, has continued uninterruptedly, for about eight years, the sufferer being denied legal redress for their losses, bv reason of the notorious insol vency of the railroad corporation. Mort gage ujioii mortgage being inscribed against them, both in Mississippi and Louisiana, "J'elion on 0a piled.'" In view of thi state of facts, it behooves the good people who have already been de spoiled' of their property by the railroad, as well a those who at any moment are liable to have their stock destroyed in like man ner, to seek that redress, through legislative action, denied to them legally by reason of the insolvency of the Company. In all other communities, north and west of us and particularly iu those States grid ironed by railroads, there are stringent en act nients requiring and compelling the com panies throughout their jurisdiction to keep the entire line of their road fenced on either side. The legislature of Mississippi will meet soon, and the present is an opportune Moment to petition that body to enact such stringent laws as will have the effect of ac complishing the end in view. A petition numerou.ly and respectably signed by the good people of your seaboard counties, asking such relief at the hands of the Leg islature, canuot fail U be favorably received by that body. You have able men in your BepresenU tives from the three counties bordering on the Gulf, and which the Jff. O. & M. K. runs through, and they will doubtless give it their attention. Your friend, B. V. James.

Fkllow-C'itizkxs of the Senate ask House of Representative? The member of the Portv-sixth Oontrress have assembled at thei first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation ami grateful acknowledg nient to the Giver of all good for the larje and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affair since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial oeration of the Government, directly affecting the business interest of the coun try. I congratulate Congress on the suc cessful execution of the Resumption Act. At the time fixed, and in the manner contemplated by law. United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the 1st of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and iti all business transaction., public and private in all parts of the country, they are received and p:i:d as the equivalent of coin. The demand ujon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes lias been comparatively small, and the voluntary dejNjsit of coin and bullion in exchange for note ha been very large. The excess of the preciou metal deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United State notes redeemed i aliout $4'), 00(1,001). THE UKr-fMPTIliN OF 

SPECIE PAYMENTS ha been foUowed by a great revival of busi ness. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal compe tition with other nation in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for our manufacture and agrienltual pro ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the lit of .Inly last to November lr, to the amount of about S"0,000,Ooo. Since the resumption of specie payment there has also lnen a marked and gratifying improve ment in the public credit. The binds of the Government bearing onlv four ier cent, interest have been sold at about par, sufficient in amount to pay oil' all of the national debt which was re definable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, H77, i $1 1,7, 177. The bond soWl were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities i much greater than ever before. The amount of the National debt which mat tires within less than two years is tT'.Ci, !:M ,700, of which $501 ,IOO70o0 bear interest at the rate of fi ve K-rceiit., and the balaneei in bond bearing six percent interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of four per cent, bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be elteeted about ?1 1, oho, uhii can be annu ally saved to the treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be pro vided by Congress during it present session. the coinage of OObU bv the mints of the United States during the last fiscal year was $40,9Sb,!12. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose up to Novemlier 1, 1S7!, wa $15,000,850, of which $1 2,700,3 14 j have been issueil from the Treasury, anu are now in circulation, anu 4i,,ioO,0UO are still in the possession of the Government. The pendency of the projiosition for unity of action lx-tween the United State i and the principal commercial nation of Kurojie to ctlect a ermanent system for the equality of gold ami silver in the recognized money of the world, lead me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. THE (i It EAT 

REVIVAL OF TRADE, internal and foreign, will supply during the coining vcar its own instructions, which may I wen tie awaueu ueiore attempting iuriuer ' experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Con gress the importance of authorizing the Sec retary of the Treasury to suspend the coin age of silver dollar upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uuiforinly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it i obvi- usly impracticable to maintain them at par wiiu eacn oiner n ooiu are coineu wun out limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined without limit, sixiii lecome the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object which isacur rency of loth gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. The retirement from circulation of United States note with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts i a step to lie taken in our progress toward a safe and staple currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of theGovernment, ami the interest and seeuiity of the people. It i my firm conviction that the issue of LEGAL-TEN DER PAPER MONEY, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme emergency, i without warrant in the Con stitution, and a violation of sound financial principle. Thi issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legaUtender between private in dividual., was not authorized except a a mean of rescuing the country from immi nent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for anv protracted period of time after the accomplishment of thi pur pose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and with drawal of these note at the earliest practi cable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The iiolicv of the Linked States, steadily Ihered to from the adoption of the Consti- tutioii, ha been to avoid the creation ol a national debt, and when from necessity, in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace a rapidly as possible, With thi view, and for "this purpose, it i recommended that the existing law for the accumulation of a Sinking Fuud sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation i deemed necesary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury. THE 

ELECTIONS of the past year, though occupied only with State omces, nave not laueu to eucit iu vue nolitieal discussions which attend them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens taKe in the progress ot tne country toward a more general and complete estab lishment, at whatever cost, of universal tuuMiritv and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of Na tional and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion expressed in my last annual message that no temporary or administrative interest of government, how ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace the leal of our people in defence of the primary rights of citizensnip. And that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices and all sectional and State attachments. In demanding that all over our wide territory the name and char acter of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with Khem unchallenged security and respect, I earnestly appeal to the intelligence ana pa triotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other political sub? jects, to unite in compelling obedjence o existing laws-aimed at the protection of he right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in the laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of the Executive and legis lative authorities of the States in this great purpose, f am fully convinced that jf fhe public mind can be set at rest on the para mount question of popularjrights BO.aerjam obstacle wilHb wart or delay the coropleta pacification of the country, or retard the general diffusion of prosperity. - In a former message I invited the atten tion ot Congress to the subject of the refor mation if the s -- crvit' Slavics gftVwccci.t.fisJ Ctrrfss?! tba In tention of transmitting to Congress as early a practicable a report upn this subject by the Chairman of the Civil Service Commis sion. i - ... I in view oi tne lacu ttiat, during a con- j siderable period, the Government of Great ! Rritain ha been dealing with adruinistra i tive problems and abuses, in various tar- j ticular3 analogous to those presented in this I country, and that in recent years the i measure adopted were understood to have ! been effective, and in everv respect highly S satisfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have j fuller information uon the subject, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a ' thorough investigation for thi purpose, j The result lias been an elaborate and com prehensive rejxirt. The report set forth I the history of" the partizan spoils svstem in Great Rritiau and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage and official inter ference with the freedom of elections. It shows that after long trials of various kind of examination, those which arecompetitive and open on equal term to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great advan tage been established ascondilionsof admis sion to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the nqiort, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omis sion of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expense of the commission, ha been postponed until the piescnt time. It i herewith transmitted to Congress. While the reform measures of another Government are of no authority to us, they :re entitled to influ ence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our insti tutions anil social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the I HI 

FELTS AND AH LSI- in our civil administration remain un changed, except in so far as an enlarged experience ha deejiened my sense of the duty, both of officers and of the people themselves, to co-operate tor their removal. The giave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office, and of office tenure, are now generally recog nized. In the resolution of the great parties, in the report of Department., in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of the evil has been pointed out, and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command tne necessary supixirt. every measure of reform must be based on com mon right and justice and must be compati ble with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable ami essential in a free State. When the jieople have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the otlieers they have selected, and of the advisers who, in accoi dance with our jolitieal institutions should le consulted in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, i indis pensable, ft i eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well a illustrate it spirit in the performance of their official duties. It hardly need be pointed out that very dillerent considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their resjwnsibility i to their superiors iu official jiosition. It is their duty to obey the legal instruction of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the dis charge of their functions irresjiective of par tisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power, whatever policy prevails. As a consequence, it follows that their tenure of office should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the suprem acy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan interests. THE JETTIES. The Secretary of War further reports that the work, foi the improvement of the South l'ass of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Lads, made in pursu ance of an net. of Congress, has been prose cuted during the past year with a greater measure ot success in the attainment ot re sult than during any previous year. The channel through the South Pass, which at the beginning of operations (in June, 1875) had a depth of only seven and one-half feet of water, had on the 8th of July, 187'J, a mini mum depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less than two hundred feet, and a central depth of thiity feet. Pay ment have been made in accordances with the statute as the work progressed, amount ing in the aggregate to $4,250,000, and fur ther paymeuts will become due a provided by the statute in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. The appropriation for judicial expenses, which has heretofore been made for THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE in gross, was subdivided at the last session of Congress, and no appropriation whatever was made for the payment of the fees of Marshals and their Deputies, either in the service of process or for the discharge of other duties; and since June 3, these officers have continued the perfoimance of their dutie without compensation from the Gov ernment, taking upon themselves the neces sary incidental outlay as well rendering their own services. In only a few unavoidable instances ha the proper execution of the process of the U"Uod States failed by reason of the absence of the requisite appropriation. Thi course of official conduct on the part of these otficers.Jhighly.creditable to their fidel ity was advised by the Attorney General, yvho informed them however that they would necessarily have to rely for their compensa tion on the prospect of future legislation by Congre,. I therefore especially recommend that immediate appropriation be made by Congress for the purpose. The act making the principal appropriation, for the Depart ment of Justice at previous sessions has uniformly contained the following claus es: "And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved February 20, 1870, entitled an act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to enforce the right of citi zens of the United States to vote iu the several States of the United State, and for other purposes, or any act amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." No appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general election for member of Congress occurred, the omis sion wasfa matter of little practical impor tance. Such election will, however, take place during the ensuing year, and the ap propriations for the pay of Marshals and deputies should be sufficient to .embiace compensation for the services they may be required to perform at such elections. THE BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT is at present largely in arrears. It can not be expected that more cases can be decided than are now disposed of in its annual ses sion, or that by any assiduity the distin guished Magistrate who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits, also, the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the atten tion of Congress to an appropriate remedy. Jt is believed that all is done in each cir cuit which car) fairry be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion ot questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General is the appointment of additional Circuit Judges and the crea tion of an intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of iti jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the perform ance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional ' Cir cuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure at the present rate of salaries of not more shan f $0,QQQ a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained.
