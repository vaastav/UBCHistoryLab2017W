He said Wllshire never bought for him, nor he for Wilshlre. Wllshire had simply en dorsed soma of his paper. Mr. Blackburn said his purpose was to show that Wllshire' testimon) that he had bought for Harper, only, was not true. The court reminded counsel that Wllshire had testified that he bought a million bushels en his own account, and If the) could show l.e had bought more than this it might be done. Witness was excused.

AMUSEMENT EVENTS. KirH!nt Frrforuianr of Tha lllnck Iluiinr" "TwuOldCrontra" "Around Tlio World "Pat Kooncy LI ilt ICvana. The Dunlsp opera company presented "The Black Hussar" at the Grand last night to a small but enthusiastic audience. The opera wasadmlrably rendered, and had the coinpanj had the stimulus of a big house, the performance would have been one of the most brilliant productions of comic opera offered to Springfield patrons for a long time. But the "beggarly arra) of erupt) benches" had the effect of dis heartening the company, and the effect was visible In fhe peformance. Notwitlistand ing. the opera was produced very accepta- iiy. ana uie company is a urge anu capaoie one. Springfield pretends to enjoy comic opera, but it poorly rewards the local man ageis when tbey bring it here. Manager Dunlap, who has managed McCanll's com panies for) ears, told a reporter last night that he never played to expenses iu Spring- held in his life. The Dunlap company includes about thirty-five people ami the chorus is a magnif icent one. The principal artists are of high ability. Harry Brown, who created the role of Lorenzo In Mascotte.and Mount' jo) Walker, who has been seen here be fore, were very funny as Uackenback, the magistrate, and Piffkow, his factotum. Mr. Cnarles T. Dungan was graceful and stately as Von Helbert, the Black Hussar, and Miss Johnson, Miss Stanley and Miss Falrbalrn were excellent as Minna, Ilosetta and Barbara, respectively. The costumes were very pretty, and altogether the "Black Hussar" was worth) of a big house. Mr. Charles T. Ellis and his excellent compaii) gave another performance of that charming comedy-drama, "Casper, the Yixller," at Black's, last night to a de lighted audl-ie. Mr. Ellis will alwa)s be warmly weltorned in Springfield. "TWO OI.Il CltONIfS." This afternoon, that great comedv team. Mills, Hms'iaw and Ten Broeck, backed by a first rate company, are amusing a mat1 luce audience at the Grand, with "Two Old Cronies." The plav will be produced again tonight The Kausas Cit) Times. speaking ot this company, sajs: "The Mntu street theater opened Its regular session to a crowded house last night with "Two Old Cronies" a well con- coiU d coined) , musical and merry. The crowd was immensely pleased and people coming out of the theater were heard con gratulating; one another that they came. Whoever got up tne company anew ins business, for each of its members plavshis part or hers, be It big or little, tor all there Is In tt They all sing well enough to please an) audience, aud well enough to please a critic s ear. The same may be said of their acting." Secure )ur seat for tonight's perform ance at Harris's. A (.KAMI sri-CTACtr. That grand spectacular play. "At und the World in Eighty Da)s," will be pro duced at the Grand on Monday night by a very strong and capable company. The following reference to this pla), clipped from the Cincinnati Ennnlrcr. will be of Interest to tbe ladies: "It proved Itself a great matinee card at Heuck's ) eaterday afternoon The theater was packed with ladles ami children, all of whom greatly enjojed tbe spectacular. The piece is doing a phenomenal business this week, the house being sold at every performance, before the rise of the curtain. Many after-wltnessinc the performance, go to see it again, as one seldom sees such an all around clever production. The scenery and spectacular effects are really Immense and outdo all former attempts, while, un like other spectacular shows the coin pan v in itself is an exceptionally strong one." Seats are now on sale at Harris's, "rvr's WAitnnoBK." Pat Rooney. the inimitable, will be at Black's next Tuesday evening In that side splitting piece. "Pat's Wardrobe." The Manchester Union says of it: " The popular Pat Kooney drew a fair sized audience to the opera house last even ing, to laugh at his eccentric delineation of farcical Irish character. It proved an en tertaining evening as the hearty laughter of the audience attested. His new play, ' Pat's Wardrobe.' is the best setting that Pat Itooney has bad for tbe display ot his specialty. As Pat O'HooIlhan,' Rooney appears without variation from his familiar line. The part created for Katie Rooney. under the title of 'Christopher,' gives the little lady plenty of room to display a clever tslent that is rapidly developing." The sale of seats is now progressing at C. 11. Pierce 4 Co.'s. II77IK EVANS. The Cincinnati Knjiifrcr sa)s ot the lit tle lad) who Is to appear next Wednesday evening at Black's in "Onr Angel."

Harrv Jones was sent up from this city at the time mentioned for burglarizing the house of Mrs Belle Williams, of west High street between Center and Market streets.
