MCla,Clre,,thit ile editoriif the Philadelphia Times, whose broad range of mind has stained him as one I of Anisrica's most conservative and a nationally patriotic men, never slow v in recognizing the possibilities and prospects of the South, has been again I on a recent tour in this section. V Col. McClure nnder the caption, "Industrial Growth of the South," in I a recent editorial. in his paper, has t much to say of the rapid and substan- c tial development of the South, full of information to the people of the u North, who are in profound ignorance { concerning this aectio. t We make the following selectiona s from the article : "A recent hasty visit to some of the E leading tcentres of industry in the Southern States east of the Mississippi demonstrated the wonderful progress r the South is making in every line of t industry. It the people of the North understood the material interests of 4 the South as they really are, and ap- t preciated the steady and rapid ad vancement not only ih the develop- i ment of the mineral wealth of those t States, but also in the growth of agri- I cultural. interests, it would be price less benefit in both sections." a a a a "The common idea of the North is that the indnstrial progress of the South is %%holly or chiefly in the coal, iron, etc., of that section, but is a grave error. Our people know of Birmingham and| the many other in dustrial centres which have spring np as if by magic benanse of the devel opmeut of iron, coal, ete., but the very important fact is very generally overlooked that the advancement of agriculture in the South is fully. al,reastawithºthe growth in other in dustries. In all the Southern States States East of the Mississippi, from the Virginias down to the Gulf, there s has been a rapid growth in the farm ing indut yy. The old system of large plantations is rapidly yielding to small farms pnrchased or leased by both races who work their own fields, and the result is that the products of the land are doublled or trebled,.by the better tilling that prevails. "Ten years ago the Times pointed out the advantages of the South over the West for farming emigration, and each year has proved more clearly the wisdom of -that suggestion. There are to-day cheaper and more produc tive lands, with better climate and ac cess to markets, in all the Southern States East of the Mississippi, incln ding Alabama, Florida and Mississ ippi, than can be found in any of the Western States." "Indeed, if the industrial people who start from the Eastern States to find new homes for their families -in new sections of the country, were intelli gently advised of the countless ad vantages the South offers them o er the far Western States, the whole tide of industrial temigration would speed ily turn from the boasted sway of em pire toward the setting snn'and settle down in the Sunny South." The last paragraph] quoted above "holds the key to the situation given by an observant Northern man, for it is the very broadest suggestion that Swe of the South are not energetically putting forth the information needed a in the North or nusing our best efforts to secure the immigration of "the in. A dustrial people who start fromnt the SEastern States'to findr"new homnes." -[Natchez.Demnocrat. -An old horse which managed to r soape from the Custer mausacre, is on the'lension list and is being'cared'for at Fort Riley. The attentionnof the Republicans should be called to the fact that the old government mules have been left out in the cold, and no longer feed from thoerear endjof a blue wagon,but'-roamnitoothless about the army posts gumming as best they can the tough sage grass. If the poor beasts could cast a vote they would 'have been placed"on the pensionllist long ago, butthere is yet time for the Republicans to amend the constitu tion and give themn the right of suf Sfrage. These faithful old mules are betterentitled to a pension than the Sthonsands of bonnty jumpers and de serters who are bleeding the treasury -to the eitent of millions of dollars. -[States.

I -A New York special of Sunday says ; "One of the weirdest and most tragic scenes ever witnessed in a cham ber of death was that enacted to-day in the room where druggist George ver W.
