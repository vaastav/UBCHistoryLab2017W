OOCNTY OFIICIAL PAPER Member National Editorial Am elatln and Oregcn Stato Editorial Association. A lot of people whom the mer chants trust are afraid to trust the merchant. Odd. isn't It? ArTOMOBILKS PURCHASED BY PARMKK3 The value of automobiles to the farmer is proved bytbe number he uses. Authorities estimate that nearly one third of the number of automo biles in the country are operated by the farmers. Yet the farmer by no means constitutes one third of our population. This illustrates the utility of the automobile where transportation is of utmost importance. In the city there are many methods of transportation. On the farm the automobile is rapid ly being established as the only way to transport oneself and one's goods with any degree of efficiency. And this fact becomes striking when we consider that of all the cars sold last year, sixty per cent, or nearly two-thirds of the number were purchased by the rural population. Of course this also includes some suburbanites. But their needs is sim ilar to that of the farmer. They hare the same problem of getting to town and hack. And the motor car is solving it in a way that Is most effi cient. There is no doubt that the useful, ness of automobiles to the farmer is increasing. The experience he has gained In the use of the motor car has taught him countless ways of ex tending its service In his daily work. A great proportion of all the cars purchased by farmers last year were f the thousand dollar type and un der. This naturally indicates the op tion of the farmer in regard to lighter weight cars, for these are the type which form the majority of last year's car sales. COUXCII. PIWK F.KIUXtJS St. Helens.

WHY BE THE TAIL? Some thirty-five or forty years ago or to long past that the memor. f man runneth not to the contrary. Columbia county was put Into a Join, senatorial district with Clackamas nd Multnomah counties. The object f this was to give Multnomah coun ty one more senator, and with one single exception Multnomah has al ways had the choice of a senator. The dally press seems to think that the present legislature will make some re-arrangement of the senator ial districts. The Mist hopes that In such re-arrangement, Columbia coun ty will be given some consideration. Columbia county does not feel like being the tall of Multnomah's kite. The Mist believes that when the re-arrangement of the districts Is considered that Representative Sher nan Miles will do his utmost in hav 'ng Columbia county placed in a dis trict, where once in a third or half century, it will be given some con sideration. Columbia has grown and developed In the past thirty-five years and Is entitled to recognition among other Oregon counties. 

GIVE THEM VALUE Eleven of the sixteen road district 'n Columbia county have voted upon themselves a special tax for the Im provement and maintenance of roads J within their respective districts. The fart that tha Ihimva, 4b minM I K J 1 o Tilling in dig down and bring out the dollars for road work is a good Indication ol the progressive spirit of Columbia county people, and since these ta. layers are willing to bear an addi tional burden in these times when! retrenchment seems to be the general I Idea, is proof conclusive of their! aim in Columbia county. The Mist hopes that the county court will see that the taxpayers get the value of 'he dollar in road expenditures and '.hat the work accomplished In the oming year will spur them on in rurther progress. The Financial and Trade Review' if the Alexander Hamilton Institute In its November issue, goes exhaust ively into the business conditions of the country. The Review can see no cause for alarm as tn, business conditions existing. The country, as a whole, is exceedingly prosperous, the bank deposits are the greatest averjr known and there is, apparent ly, no cause for alarm in the general -eadjustment of business affairs throughout the country. limits of the city of St. Helens, Ore gon, along Willamette street in said city on what is known as the DeSpain hill, was full of holes and in very bad shape, and In need of repair; Therefore, be It Hesolved by the city council of said city, that a re quest be made to the county court of Columbia county Oregon, to repair and fix up said road on said street; Therefore, we, tho city council of said city, would respectfully request that you have the said road on said street repaired and put in shape at your earliest convenience."
