PEOPLE TAKE LITTLE INTEREST IN AFFAIR Talk of Rater with Disappointment and Sorroir, bat People Prefer to Await Her Death to Name Successor. THE HAGUE. Dec. "-(Special Cable gram to The Bee.) The belief, everywhere Browing, that the German kaiser has cast longing eyes towards the sea ports of Holland and that he has Inaugurated a commercial and economic. If not the poli tical conquest of the nation has given rise to all sorts of speculation regarding the future of the country. It ts only a few years Ago that the hopes of the people of Holland were pinned on their queen. Much was expectnd from genuine love match, and while not popular with those In high authority at the court the mere fact that the "Wllhulmtnije ' had married the man of her choice If myhlng only served to draw the hearts of the people more closely to her. To those who have followed the yourK queen from her childhood to the present day the chango In the "child of the Dutch people" Is painful in the extreme. The bright winsome charm has faded end there lingers about her mouth and over her brow n unmistakable expression of a disappointed woman. The enthusiasm with which the Hollanders once spoke of her has died away and she is -iow Seldom referred to except with a sigh. It seems but a few years ago that the walls of the gloomy palace rang with the laughter of little - children, who came to play with "Wllhelmlntje." Now all Is changed and the queen hides the sorrow of her unhappy marriage, as many months of the year as Hlie can at Loo. Meanwhile a strange story is being cir culated to the effect that there l.i a clause in the Dutch constitution providing that If the queen has no Issues within rive ears of her marriage that is before February 7 of next year the Dutch Parliament has the power to dissolve the union. A further rumor has gained ground that there is a clause in the marirage contract per mitting this to be done, Had Her Owi War. , - So little does the Dutch constitution In terfere with a choice of a prince or queen to have married quite contra:-' . to the opinions of her government, and slio also hud her own way in all of the dotulls connected with this' momentous affair for Holhuul. Holland Is a profoundly christian country and the mere sugestlon of such a possibility as a change In a prince oonsort ' or a queen consort Is revolting to Its principles and sentiments. At 'he tame time the marriage relation Is suid to be considered by Queen Wllhelmlnu her self as far too binding to allow of any Much a solution of the question of suc cession. It ts this very question of suc cession that Is understood to be absorbing the attention of her government which Is now busying itself with a revision of the constluttlon. Under present conditions the matter is by no means clear, but as the monarchy is a constitutional aid herldltary one it is to be presumed that apart from any special enactment on the nart of the Dutch people the succession would follow the same law of inheritance as that of Great Brltlan. In this case the merest agnate line of the House of Orange is now rvprsaented by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Welmur, grand son of the prlnoesa Sophie of the Nether lands, sister of the late King William III and second cousin to the present queen The grand duke might choose between the crowns of Saxe-Weimar and Holland, but by the constitution of the German rrnpiie lie could not carry both. It Is therefore to be assumed that he would remain con tent with his present sovereign position. People Apathetic ills rights of succession would next devolve. on his sister or on the children iif his aunt who became a princess of Reus. Of this family there are several princes, Who might legitimately be called to the Orange throne. More remote still from them is another line of agnates descended from an uncle of the late King William III Prince Fred nick of Orange, who married a Princess Louise of Prussia and whose daughter married the Prince of Weld. Throughout Holland there exists today an antipathy of all discussion of a possible suc- rb."ion to Wtlhelmlna. Of course the nu'Rtlon of a succession must come up when Queen Wilhelinlna dies, but Just ' at pr.scnl the proposition If discussed would laobably bo iliscussod with disappointment And bitterness. It will be remembeied that at thn lime the queen's wedding the worn ' l; public" was echoed on every hand wlun the question "'who shall reign if i In-re h- no heir" was raised.

SHAW ON THE UNEMPLOYED are Present Condition In Oreot Rrltala dhows Inefficiency of Present System. LONDON. Dec. . (Special Cablegram to The Bee.) Tho question of aiding the un employed in London is a very serious one and Queen Alexandra has stepped bravely Into the breach, says Bernard Shaw. She has waited for Parliament to deal with the question and Parliament has done nothing has Indeed with great difficulty been pre vented from doing less. She has waited for the prime minister to advise, and the prime minister avows his utter helpless ness. The resources of the constittulon being thus exhausted, she has boldly thrown the constitution to the winds and taken the matter In hand h"rself. She ha, said in effect to our wise men: "Well, If you cannot get my people work. I will give them bread Who will come and help me?" In doing this the queen has precipitated a crisis that was bound to come sooner or later. The situation Is not new. In cities like ancient Rome or modern London com petitive commerce always Anally creates a proletariat too numerous to be effectually coerced and too clever to be duped by spurious political economy and pious plati tudes about the sacredncss of law and or der. In 1S6, when the windows of the clubs In Fall Mali were broken, tho classes represented by those rlubs immediately paid nearly $50.0fn) ransom to the Mansion House fund, most of which went Into the hands of anything but hard working peo ple. Trade revived and staved off the emergency for a time, but it is upon us again and now the question is, arc wo to accept panem et clrccnses as a regular part of our metropolitan organization? We must, if the alternative Is to leave the un employed, to choose between starvation and plunder. The queen will not allow her people to be starved. She has forced our hand and is going to organize panem (the circuses will come later) with her own hands, unless we find work and wages for the unemployed, who, by the way, will very soon acquire a taste, like their social superiors, for Incomes without work. It Is a critical situation and one that may become dangerous If those who understand it are too courtly or too cowardly to speak out. Tho queen's charity Is the last re source of a bankrupt civilization. If we can do nothing better we must adopt it, and she is right to force the alternative on us. But can we do nothing better? For my part I can see no difficulty In finding work for the unemployed. Take the places they live In, for instance. There Is the urgently necessary work of knocking those places down, burning their putrid debris and replacing them with decent dwellings In airy and handsome streets. The spots, to begin with, are already marked by Mr. Charles Booth on the map of London In black. If, instead of directing the attention of the unemployed, as In 18.S6, to the possibility of extorting a demoral ising ransom by destroying the houses of other people, we could set them to the eminently desirable and honorable work of destroying their own and building better onea to replace them, the queen would not need to empty her private purse with tho heart-breaking knowledge that her money would Mye jjexjonle jjyg.t.. the.,,.,. I pense of their chi pense of their characters. It is true that there Is no commercial de mand for a new and decent city; but, pray, for what great social work Is there any commercial demand? How long will it take us to see that great nations work for na tional profits and keep the little souls who can understand nothing but commercial profits out of the national councils? There Is no luck of money, no lack of work, no lack of charity. It Is character and statesmanship tliut we want, and these, alas, cannot be created by checks and subscription books. . IN

ANCESTOR WORSHIP STRENGTH OF EMFIRE Despite Diversity of Religions. All Japanese Venerate- Their Ances tors. More Especially Those of Royal House. TOKIO, December 9.-(Sneclal Cablegram to The Bee.)-There Is distress and famine throughout Japan, but the situation Is not so serious as has been painted in the re ports sent broadcast throughout the world. The resources of the country were drained by the war with Russia and considerable help will have to come from ouulde the empire If actual starvation is to be pre vented In the northern districts. Help has already been received from Great Britain and America and more has been promised. No general request for help has been made and none will be permitted by the Japa nese government. In Japan the number of lepers is second only to India, and hitherto no regulations for the control of them have existed. They are allowed to wander in the streets and solicit alms. With the exception of the missionary effort which dealt with many hundreds, they are unheeded and uncared for. In the coming session of the Diet special laws will be introduced. The lepers will be Isolated and supported by the local governments. The Japanese have lost no time lf coming to such an agreement with the government of Corea as has been rendered necessary by the issue of the war. It was the per sistent intrigues of Russia In Corea which forced Japan to draw the sword. The weakness, the corruption and the treachery of the government of Seoul offered a con stant arid favorable field for the exercise of the arts in which Russian diplomatists of a certain school excel, and the hardi hood and ability with which they pursued their ends constituted a perpetual menace, not only to the future development of Japan, but to Its security, so long as their proceedings were unchecked.

Bushldo, wonderful as its teachings and In fluenoes have been. Is at best only a class religion, or, more . properly speaking, an ethical code. Ancestor worship is univer sal. It may be said without any exaggera tion that every Japanese man, woman and child is an ancestor worshiper. This ap plies to the Christian convert as well us tho Buddhist devotee. Ancestor worship, or more properly speaking, the veneration of ancestors, is something Independent of re ligion. It does not Interfere with religion and it cannot be affected by iu It is worth noting that here in the Orient the greatest strides were made by the Jesuit fathers in gaining converts and power after they had declared that ancestor worship was not a religion and therefore need not be abandoned by the convert to Christianity. It should be thoroughly understood that ancestor worship does not stop with the veneration of the family ancestors. That is but the first step, and there follows the veneration of the clun deities and, the highest of all, the veneration of the im perial ancestors. In this way there is a perfect form of religion for tho develop ment of the Datriotism and lovaltv nt th people as well as the morals of the home.

THREE TROLLEY CREWS Two Highwaymen Do Rushing Haul- na on West "Ide of llansrnm Park. Last night between and 10:15 three Wet side Hanscom park cars were h"ld up In succession at the end of that linn near Thirty-second and Murtha streets. Paul Ray and H. W. Fitch. In charge of motor car No. 101, were the first victims. They were both snoted In the car getting warm while waijlng for time at the end of the run. Two men suddenly appeared and 'ordered them to put up their hands. Tho smaller of the two then relieved Ray and Fitch of their money, all pf which be longed to the company. The amount was small, about tl. The highwaymen wailed until the next csr had backed into the switch when they forced Ray and Fitch to walk over to the ear last arrived. This car was under the control of P. L. Peterson and E. R. Forbes. These men were forced to put up their hands as the others had been. This time the robbers got about $2T and also relieved Forbes of his watch. The third car, which was under tho con trol of M. A. Flsk and J. S. Rose, finally arrived and the sanio maneuver was re peated. The robbers got about ns much from the last crew as from the second, so that the entire loss was about S(0. and the one watch. After getting the money from the third crew one of the robbers held covered the six train men with his gun while the other went from car to car and pulled the trol lies off the wire and afterward cut the ropes. Then ordering the looted crews to stay in the car that pulled In last, the two men backed away. They took the Central boulevard in the direction leading to Vin ton street and after reaching the top of the hill started away on a run. As soon as possible: a warning was sent to the police station and a hurry call was made to the scene. At Twenty-fifth and Leavenworth part of the officers left the patrol and took the east side park car. This they employed to take them up the west side track, driving It to the limit of Its speed. The patrol met the first of the crews as It was coming In and the train men stopped and gave a description of the men who hod robbed them. They said the robbers were both men of medium height, one slightly larger than the other, and perhaps an Inch the taller. Both wore short, dark overcoats and each had two revolvers. The faces of tne men could not be seen for they had them covered with white pocket handkerchiefs. After getting this description the patrol hurried to the place of the robbery and there picked up some of the officers. They then made a run on the boulevard to Twenty-fourth and Vinton, where a warning was sent to South Omaha and instructions sent to the police operator for the use of the patrol men and detectives. The saloons In the vicinity of Vinton street were visited, but no sign of the men was found. BALFOUR OPENS CAMPAIGN Leader of British Opposition Party Slake stirring gpeech at Manchester. MANCHESTER. Dec. . Arthur J. BaiJ four, now the leader of the opposition party In the United Kingdom, opened the cam paign In a stirring speech before his Man chester constituents today. vWith the utmost frankness the former premier explained that the resignation of government was on the ground of expediency, showing that the Ftep had been carefully considered for some time and that It was evidently contem plated by Mr. Balfour during the greater part of the year. Mr. Balfour defended the action of tliu unionist government in Its retention of office on the ground that It was essential to wait until J.he Anglo-Japanese treaty wus finally concluded and other necessary features of the government program, had been carried out, with the exception of the redistribution bill, an outline of which had been given to Parliament. Divisions within the unionist party led the govern ment to conclude that It would be Impos sible at present to carry a measure which demanded absolute unity. Without going at any length In the prob able platform of the liberals, the former premier poked fun at the liberal protest against being forced to accept office and ridiculed the efficacy of a party composed of so many factions. He laid the lash of bitter sarcasm on what he declared to be w ..,ni,,,8 ooniij ruie me teaaing issue, ana saia wnetner tney m ashamed of it or not, home rulers they I were '"J home rulers they will rernain. Mr. Balfour plainly Intimated that the unionist attack would be centered on the home rule record of the liberals, while the unionists would use their own record on home, foreign and colonial policies as their bulwark of defence. He challenged the liberals on the Issue of Chinese labor ln South Africa. Here the former premier became severely de nunciatory. He said the liberals had won bye elections by unscruplous disregard of the truth. Mr. Balfour made a strong plea for unity during the elections. He hoped that the new administration, when it handed back the reins to the unionists, would be able to point to a record creditable to the country. He declared he intended to lead the op position through the campaign. "The party elected me its leader and I propose to carry out the great mission en trusted to my hands." he said. "I am per fectly confident that from all sections of the party., be the minor differences what they may, I shall receive that support which I have never wanted for In the past n the past." Mr. Balfour made no reference to Joseph Ciiamberlain or his fiscal policy.

VIEWS OniATHEWS United States Varsbal Will 6eek to Efte Stigma of Dism'ssal Effaced. GOES TO CONSULT R. B. SCHNEIDER After Return Says Bo Has Asked Ei( Friends to Stsnd by Him. LAYS REMOVAL TO FALSE REPORTS Insists that Extravagant Humors Were Seat to. Uanhington. WILL NOT MAKE PLANS PUBLIC NOW Mathews' Son Says Loss of Office la Nothing aa Compared with Odium ot . the Re moval, , T. L. Mathews, the retiring United States marshal, returned Saturday evening from Fremont, where he had gone earlier in the day to consult with' Republican National Committeeman R. li. 8ciincldcr relative to his summary dismissal from office. H waa then willing for the first time to discuss the matter publicly and declared: "It would le imprudent for ine to say anything at this ilme as to what steps I shall take to secure a vindication. How ever, I may say that I have, asked my friends In Washington, Including the entire Nebraska congressional delegation, to as sist In my vindication. My letter to Bec retary Moody is in Itself self-explanatory and there is very little that I can add to It. "The question seems to arise over the false and' extravagant report that after Richards and Comstock had been sentenced by the court I not only turned them over to their attorney, R. S. Hall, without war rant, but that I was with them In a Jaunt about the saloons and restaurants and ac companied them to the theater, glvlnff them a good time generally. This report, which has been made much of. Is an abso lute and unqualified lie and without the slightest semblance of truth. The simple facts of the case are that when Richards and Comstock were sentenced I was not ln the court room and did not hear the sen tence Imposed at the time. I did learn ot Its purport a few moments later and took the two men into cuatody. Hall an Officer of Court. "R. 8. Hall, their attorney, is a practi tioner before tho United States courts and a gentleman of unimpeachable Integrity. By virtue of his position as a lawyer and practitioner before the federal courts he Is end was an officer of the court. He asked that he be designated as the custodian ot his two clients, who were also men of the highest character and integrity, during the six hours of their (technical Imprisonment. Mr. Hall stated that he Would take them to the Omaha club and remain with them there during the six hours and did so as a special officer under my direction. The party did not leave the Omaha club during- -the' vnMre m'r 1 ri ami L was lii - tant touc'h with thsrrt and knew whore ' they were every moment of that time. "Tho order of the court did not state that Mess.-s. Richards and Comstoc't should be Imprisone'd In the Douglas county Jail, but simply that they should be Ini Vrlsoned In the custody of tho United States marshal. You will recolloct that ln passing sentence upon these uen, .'udg-.i Mtuiger suid that thoy were not guilty ot anv moral turpitude, and that their of fense was merely a statutory -n. ' The natural presumption followed that Judte Munger did not expect me to exercise l.arsli measures toward these men, nor did 1 feel disposed to do so under thoti sentence and under the rlreumstances. I may have been guilty of a technical fault In not holding these men in my office under ,fcuard with a pistol pointed in their .face. tellltir them to sit there for the six hour. Sentence was parsed about 4:30 or 6 o'clock und it was near dinner time, and I did not .so construe my duties as to handcuff these men and put l"g irons on them and takj them to a hotel or restaurant and feed them. Feels Guiltless of M'rong. I ahull certainly ask for a vindication. and I feel confident that when all the real facts are. known I "hall not "e deem" guilty of moral turpitude In extending to these men a courtesy that was perfectly wlthln my province as an officer of thn government. "I feel deeply graterul for tne many ex pressions of kindness that have greeted me from my friends In all quarters of the state In this unioriuuaie iiiaiiel4 . hm,c no Idea a this time who will be named I . T t . n .-a h..n as my irew" 1 "" - pretty busy for the last day or so and have not yet outlined my plans. I shall act entirely upon the advice of my friends ln the matter and cannot say whether 1 shall go to Washington and lay my case before tho president personally or not. "In reference to the article ln the New York Sun which retails the story of my accompanylng these men to the theater, saloons and restaurants while they were my prisoners. I have not yet fully deter mined what I shall do, but in all likeli hood I may proceed against that publica tion for criminal libel." Chief Deputy Marshal Earl Mathews, Sim of the deposed official, said: "The loss of the office Is nothing, hut my father does not like to rest undr tli stigma that the removal Implies." Court Proceeding Rlocked. As soon as the notice of removal was received Friday evening, thu proceedings of the ofilee were at mice suspended ami witnesses who were summoned for Immedi ate appearance were notified to disregard the summons until further orders. Noth ing can be done until a temporary appoint ment Is made and neither can any wit nesses or Juror fes be paid until some one Is authorized to sign the necessary chocks. The summary remoal of Marshal Math ews from office has the effect of tem porarily blocking all court proceedings of the federal building, particularly as re. gards tho criminal proceedings In- the t'nlted States district court. This estoppel of work lies in tlie legal Inability to serve subpoenas and summonses for wit. lenses. The case of II. Marowltx, a pawnbroker indicted for receiving government property In pawn which was to hava 'Ken irled Saturday morning, has b-en passod for tills icason. No criminal cases ran be trlfil until a l ulled States marshal Is appointed temporarily to succeed Mr. Mathews to serve the necessary papers, 'the court would be Incomplete without the presence of that important official.
