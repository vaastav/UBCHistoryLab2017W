The people at large have voiced their approval of President Wilson's message to Congress. President Wilson gave most attention to the subject of "preparedness," making many excellent suggestions and some that are subject to doubt. Every question that concerns the domestic and foreign relations of the United States has received due consideration, and the message con tains enough to keep the present Congress busy ends. until tha session 

ENGLISH FEELING. The feeling of England against the United States was manifest In the House of Commons on Monday, when Lord Robert "Cecil, Parlia mentary Undersecretary, replying to queries regarding the Ford peaco mission, parried the issue by saying: "Speaking for myself, I think it would bo in .the highest degree un dignified for the Government of this country to send any Intimation to a lot of ladles and gentlemen who, whatever their merits may be, are of no particular Importance." It was also urged that the Americans l notified that their mission would I J "Irritating and unwelcome." MAKES BAD BREAK. SS"iJsi"SNpKPWe?pW3e"SV,SrteT SOGIETY.

Tumulty, who according to our en emies Is working harder for tho Pope than for tho President, has publicly denied that there Is evi dence that the Carranzlstas were guilty of tho cruelties and shameful atrocities laid to their charge by Mexican and American Bishops, Dr. Francis Kelley and others. Now Dr. Kelley, and Dr. TIerney, of New York, hold affidavits In proof of their contentions, but these legal papers are not accepted as evidence in the absence of similar affidavits oiuciaiiy lanen Dy government rep resentatives. This causes the Sun dan Visitor to suggest that Tumulty can not be priest-ridden (?) after all. The best that can be said for the secretary Is that he made a' bad break, and some think not without cosreion. Mrs. Charles E. Cooney, after a three weeks' visit with her par ents, Mr. and Mrs. J. B.

OATHOLIO LITERATURE. Certain it is, in the words of Father John Burke, "If wo are to make ourselves truly Catholic in our character, our aims, our princi ples, then we must be readers of Catholic litorature." Catholic books and periodicals are staple food for Catholic minds which without them Inevitably show signs' of weakness and disease. A largo portion of the dally press, many of tho popular magazines, plays presented every where, lectures and books lauded on all sides, even much work done along sociological lines with sincer est gopd will, all these are infected with the poison which broadly may bo called materialism under its vari ous aspects, whether we call It worldliness, humanitarianism, So cialism, pragmatism, New Thought, or porhaps the higher criticism. Against this formidable army is Catholic literature pitted. Our minds can not serve God and mammon; they can serve but one of the two, and their choice depends largely on whether they accept guidance from the church or from the world, from Catholic literature or from Ibsen, Mneterllnok, Bergson and Tagore. Mrs. William Wolfenberger was last week called to Bowling Green, wiiere her rather, Gus Bardmaker, was critically ill, and died soon after her arrival. Miss Elizabeth Kremer, who is attending Dana Hall, will return next week to spend the holiday sea son with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. George W. Kremer. Miss Susan McDermott, who is attending school In New York, will return to spend the holidays with her parents, Lieut. Gov. and Mrs. Edward J. McDermott. Misses Elizabeth and .Frances Malone, will return from school at Cincinnati, and Miss Helen Malone from New York, to bo with their parents, Mr. and Mrs. John T. Ma lono, for the Christmas holidays. MASONIC TESTIMONY. Cardinal William O'Connell, of Boston, was flfty-six years old on Wednesday. The distinguished churchman was the recipient of many congratulatory messages, num bers coming from his Protestant ad mirers. j JJ TAKE WHITE VEIL. Hon. Frank T. Walsh, who is Chairman of the Federal Committee on Indusrial Relations and owner of the Kansas City P08t with Mrs. Walsh and their two daughters, Misses Marie and Louise, passed through Louisville on Tuesday en route to Loretto, where the young women entered the mother house of the Sisters of Loretto, taking the white veil with a large class of postulants, of which they have been members. They were accompanied by Miss Marie Burnett and Miss ;nri .AaiiiHHaiso of Kansas City. INOK TO LECTURE.

Blight, writing In the Bulletin of Los Angeles Consistory of Masons, pays this just tribute: "In certain circles it is popular to de nounce bitterly the Roman Catholic church, and in the condemnation forget her splendid achievements and the consecrated service she has ren dered to humanity. Tho long roll of patriots, statesmen, philanthropists, thinkers, heroes and saintly souls who have drawn their spiritual in spiration from her communion is sufficient proof of the real greatness of her -religious teaching. Among the priests aro those whose names have become synonymous with purity of life and unselfish effort for the betterment of humanity: Father Damien, father Mathew, Father Junipero Serra, St. Francis of Assist, Savonarola. iHor countless institutions of learning, her mani fold charities, tho universality of her spiritual appeal, must awaken the admiration of all men. It must not bo forgotten that at her altars the common people received their first training in democracy. Prince and pauper, peasant and merchant, knelt together, equal before God. During the long night of the Dark Ages the lamp of knowledge was kept, burning in the monasteries. Tolerance knows that there are two sides to every question, and that a picture that shows only shadows is essen tially false." Truth commends this to the -prayerful perusal of members of anti-Catholic organizations. Y. M.I. MAOKIN COUNCIL, 205. Meets Monday Evenings at Club House, 344 North Twenty-sixth. President John J.
