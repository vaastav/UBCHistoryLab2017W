ANNUAL MESSAGE —OF THE— President of the United States TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS At the Commencement of the Third Session OF THE FORTY-FIFTH CONGRESS. Fellow-Citizens of theScnateand Hons ot Ecpresen Our bearUelt gratitude Is due to tbe Divine Be ing, who holdB in His bands tbe destinies of Na tions, for the continued bestowal, during the last year, of countless blessings upon our country. TVe are at peace with all otber Nations. Ourpub- llo credit bas greatly improved, and is, perhaps, Dow stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil; our manufacturing industries are reviving, and it 1b believed that general prosperity, "which has been o long anxiously looked for, is at last within our reach. The enjoyment of health by our peopie generally has, however, been interrupted during the past season by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence, the . yellow fever, in some portions of the Southern States, creatine an emergency which, called for prompt and extraordinary measures of relief. The disease appeared, as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the Lower Mississippi, soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugi tive from the infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early in November. The State of Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee have suf fered severely. About one hundred thousand cases are believed to have occurred, of which, about twenty thousand, aecording to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible to esti mate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic It Is to be reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted, excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union, phy sicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the affiicted communities. Volun tary contributions of money and supplies, in every needed form, were speedily and generously fur nished. The Government was able to respond in Borne measure to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines and food for the Blck and desti tute, the requisite directions for the purpose being given, in the confident expectation that this action of the Executive would receive the sanction of Congress. About eighteen hundred tents, and rations of the value of about twenty-five thousand dollars were sent to cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper department. The fearful spread of this pestilence bas awaxened a very general public sentiment in favor of National sanitary administration, which shaU not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision of internal commerce in times of epi demics, and hold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power- to deal with whatever endangers the public health, and which the municipal and State authorities are enable to regulate. The National Quarantine Act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late In the last session of Congress to provide the means for carrying it Into practical operation, dur ing the past season. Is a step in the direction here Indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of our bos porta, and the country generally, from this and other epid2mlcs. It Is recommended that Congress give to the whole sub ject early and careful consideration. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens tn every civil and political right continues to be of paramount Interest with the great bodv of our peo pie. Every step in Uus direction Is wel comed with public approval, and every Interruption of steady ami uniform progress to the aesired consummation awakens general nn eaeiness and wide-spread condemnation. The re cent Congressional elections have furnished a di rect and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical establishment of the right of suffrage, secured by the Constitution to the liberated race in the Southern States. AH disturb ing influence, real or Imaginary, had been re moved from all of these States. The three constitutional amendments, which con ferred freedom and equality of civil and political richts upon tlie colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent action of the greet body of (rood citizens who maintained the authority of the National Government and the inteeritv and perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and necessary embodimeut in the organic law of thejust results of the war. The people of the former slave-holding States accepted these results and gave in every practicable form assurances that the Thirteenth. Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and laws passed in pur suance thereof, should, in good faith, be enforced, r.gidiy and in. onrtialiy in letter and spirit, to the end that tiie Humblest citizen, without distinc tion of race or color, should under them receive full and enual protection in person and property and in political richts and privileses. By these constitutional amendments the Southern sec tion of the Union obtained a large increase of po litical power in Con tress and in the Electoral Col lege, and the country justly expected that elec tions would proceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the same circumstances of lee-al and consti tutional freedom aud protection which obtained in all the other Mates of the Union. The friends of law and order looked forwa.d to the conduct of these elections as offering to the general judgment of the country as important opportunity to measure the degree in which the right of suffrage con id be exercised by the colored people, and would be re spected by their Jc-llow-citizens; but a more gen eral enjoyment of freedom of suffrage by the col ored people, and a more just and generous protec tion of that freedom by the communities of which they form a part, were generally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. Iu some of those States in which the colored people have Ween unable to make theiropinions felt in the elections, the result is mainly due to influences not easil' measured or remedied by legal protection; but in The States of Louisiana snd South Carolina at large, and in some particular Congressional dis tricts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the conclusion that the rights of the colored voters lave been overridden, and their participation in the elections not ner mitted to be either general or free. It will be for the Congress for which these elec tions were held to make such examinations into their con duet as may be appropriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it beoomes the duty of the Ex ecutive and Judicial Departments of the Govern ment, each in is province, to inquire into and pun ish violations of the laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I ea:d in this connection in n.y last message, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the Legislatures, the Courts, the executive authorities, and the people of he States where these wrongs have been per petrated, to give their assistance toward bringing to justice the offenders, and preventing a repetition af the crimes. No means within my power will be pared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alieged crimes, and to secure the conviction and Just punishment of the guilty. It is to be observed thnt the principal appropria tion made for the Department of Just ice at "the last session contained the following clause: "And for defraying the expenses which may tie incurred in the enforcement of the act approved february 28, 1871, entitled. 'An act to amend an act approved May 13, 1S70, entitled An act e enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote 1n the several States of the Union, and for other purposes. or any acts amend atory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion of tiie Aftorney General that the expenses of these proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was then provided, and I rely onndently opon Congress to make adequate ap propriations U enable the Executive Department to enforce tbe laws. I respectfully urge npon your attention that the Congressional elections, in every district, in a very Important sense, are justly a matter of political in terest and concern throughout the whole country. ach State, every political party, is entitled to the hare of power wbicn is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right of every citizen, possessing the qualifications prescribed by law, to cast one unintimidated ballot, and to have bts ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power and the enjoyment . of this right are common and equal, practically, as well as formally, submission to the results of the suffrage wiil be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and ail the departments of Govern ment wiil feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative Interests of Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people In defense of the primary rights of citizenship. Tney understand tuat tue protection or liberty re- j quires the maintenance, in full vigor, of tbe manly j methods of free eneecu, free pre, and free suf frage, and will sustain tbe full authority of Gov ernment to enforce the laws whish are framed to preserve these inestimable right. The material progress aud welfare of the Slates depend on the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without such protection.no prosperity vithnnr npanp nnri tl vlmln eminfrr fn oVciilv in terested in the growth aud prosperity ot all its cart s. While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feelms and reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so seriously es tranged; I feel an absolute assurance mat tne ten deneies are in thnt direction, and with increasing force. Tue power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, m demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with theui unchallenged security and respect. our relations with other countries continue "peaceful. Our neutrality in contests between for eign Powers has been maintained and respected The Universal Exposition, held at Paris dur ing the past summer, has been attended by larse numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and arrangement of tne communions or our citizens to tins great l.x Position was well enmloveil in energetic mid ludl- cious efforts to overeomethis disadvantage. The.se efforts, led and directed by the Commissioner eral. were remarkably successful, and the exhihi tton of products of American industry was credit able and exutifvihe in scope and character. The reports of the United States Commissioners, giving ;:s results in detail, win beauty inm oerore you. Our participation in this international competition for the favor and trade of the world may be ex pected to produce useful and important results, in promoting intercourse, friendship aud commerce with other Nations. In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 23, 1878, three Commissioners wero ap pointed to an International Conference on the sub ject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for the" purpose of establishing, interna tionally, the use of bimetallic money, and securing nxityof relative value net ween those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various gov ernment which bad expressed ft willingness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held its meetings in Paris In August last. The re- pott of the Commissioners, herewith submitted will show its results. No common ratio between goid and silver could be agreed upon by the con lerence. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in the wond the mone tary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or tue other of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each State. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,5oO,ot0 to pay the award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after correspond ence with the British Government, on the subject of the conformity of the award to the requirements or the treaty and to the terms of the question tnereoy sunniitteo to tne commission, tne presi dent shall deem it his duty to make the pavment, communications uinm these points were ad dressed to the British Government through the le gation of the United State at London. Failing to obtain the concurrence of the British Government in the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named, within tiie year named ny the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds ot the pav- menr, and a protest Rgainst any other construction of the same. The correspondence upon this sub ject will be laid before vou. The Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of the insurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace throughout that island. Con fident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade nnd prosperity, which it is earnestly hoped may prove "well founded. Numerous claims of A raencan citizens for relief for iniunes or restora tion of property have been among the incidents of tne iong-contiDuea nostuuies. borne or uiese claims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and tne otuers are pronusea curry ana careiui consid eration. The treaty made with Italy, In regard to recipro cal consular privileges, has been duly ratified aud proclaimed. No questions of grave importance hare arisen with any other of the European Powers. The Japanese Government has been deslrons of a revision of Buch parts of Its treaties with foreign Powers as relate to commerce, and. It is under stood, has addressed to each of the treaty Powers a-request to open negotiations with that view. The United States Government has been inclined to re gard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan are found injurious to that popio can not out anect injuriously p. a lions noiu ing commercial intercourse with them. Japan. alter a lone period of seclusion, has within the patit few years, made rapid strides In the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not unreason ably, is looking forward to the time when her re lations wit h the Nations of Europe and America snau ne assimilated to mose wnicn tney nolo with each other. A treaty looking to this end. lias been made, wnicn wm be submitted for the considera tion of the Senate, After an interval of several Tears tha ChlnAR Government has again sent envoys to the United States. They have been received, and a perma nent legislation is now established here bv that- aovenimens. it is not aouotea tnat tins step wiil he or advantage to botn Nations in promoting friendly relations and removing causes of differ ence. The treaty with tbe Samoan Islands, having vwu uui ruueu auu accepted on toe pan or ootn Governments, Is now in operation, and a survev and soundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United Staton. with a view of its occupation as a naval staUon, if iuuuu uttirLne mi luo service. Since the resumption of diplomatic relation with Mexico, correspondence has been ojtened and still continues between the two Governments upon the various a lies t ions which nt ones tim wemwi tn en. a anger tneir relations. r nile no formal agreement . t . . T ---- " " us ueen roacnea as w tne trouoies on tue border, much has been done to repress and diminish them. 1 lie eneotive force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has done much to remove the sources oi dispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also making an energetio move ment against the marauding Indian tribes. 'luis Government looks with the great est sansiacuon upon every evidence of strength in the National authority of Mexico. and npon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon ourterritory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in the control of tnese incursions, oy military movements across the border, not imperatively demanded for tiie protec tion of the lives and property of our own citizens. I shall take the earliest opportunity, consistent witn me proper aiscuarge or tins plain autv, to recognize the ability of the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of our territory. It is proposed to hold next year an International Exhibition in Mexico, and It is believed that the display of the agricultural and manufacturing pro duct of the two Nations will tend to better under standing and increased commercial Intercourse be tween their people. With Brazil and the Remibllcs of Control and South America, some steps have been taken to ward tne development or closer commercial inter course. Diplomatio relations have been resumed with Colombia and with Bolivia. A boundary question between the Argentine Renublio aud Par aguay has been submitted by those Governments for arbitration to the President of the United States, and I have, after careful examination, given a decision upon it. A naval exiedition up the Amazon and Madeira Rivers has brought back Information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like ex pedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Oceau. The reports of diplomatic and consular otticers. in relation to the development of our foreign commerce, have furnishod many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stim ulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our peopie. The report of tbe Beererary of the Treasury fur nishes a detailed statement of the operations of that department of the Government, aud of the condition of the public finances. Tbe ordinary revenues from all sources for the nscai year ended June 30, 1873. were $257,763, 878 70;- the ordinary expenditures for tbe same period were $2'3b, 964.326 80, leaving a surplus reveuue for the year of $20,799, 551 9U. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending june au, actual and estimated, are as fol lows: Actual receipts for tbe first quarter com mencing July 1. 1878, $73,339,713 43; estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of tbe year. $191,110,256 57; total receipts for the current fiscal yt ar. actual and estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows; For the quarter com mencing July 1, 1S7S, actual expenditures. $73.- 344,573 27; end for the remaining three-quarters of the year, ihe expenditures are estimated at $166,755,426 73 making the total expenditures $240,100,000; and leaving an estimated surplus revenue, for the year ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000, Tbe total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880. estimated according to ex isting laws, will be $264,500,000; and the esti mated ordinary expenditures, for the same period, will be $236,320,412 61; leaving a surplus of $28, 179.587 32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual an estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided forby the act approved Feb ruary 25, 1862, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, bow ever, a substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By its terms the public debt should have been reduced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year $518,361,806 28; the actual re duction of the ascertained debt in that period bos been $720,644,739 61, being in excess of the re duction required by the Sinking Fund Act $202, 282.933 33. The amount of the public debt, less ensh In the Treasury November 1, 1878, was $2,021,200, 083 18, a reduction since the same date laatyear, Of $23,150,617 39. The progress made dnring the last year in re funding the public debt at a lower rate of interest is very gratifying. The amount of four-per-cent. bonds sold during the present vear, prior to Novem ber 23, 1878, is $100,270,900, and six-percent, bonds, commonly known as five-twenties, to au equal amount have been or wUl bo redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the Department to place the four-per-cent. bonds within easy reaeh of every oilixen wuo desires ro invest ins savings, whether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the law be so modified thnt small sums may be invented. and that through the posWflices or other agents of tne Government, toe ireest opportunity may be given In all parte of the country for such invest ments. The best mode suggested Is. that the Department be authorized to issue certificates of deposit, of the denomination ot ten dollars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent, per annum, and con vertible at any time within one year after their issue into tne lour-per-cent. oonaa auinonzed Dy tne Keiuuding Act, and to oe issnea omy in ex change for United States notes sent to the Treas urv bv mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into an Interest-bearing security of the United States, and the money so received could be applied to the redemption of six per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was $."12,798,960. The coinage of silver dollars. under the act passed February 23,1378, amounted on tlie 23d of November, 1673. to 1 9.8 14.550, of which amount $4,9U,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in the pobaessiou or t ne Lrovernment. W ith views unchanged with regard to tne act nn- der which the coinage of silver proceeds, it has been tne purpose or tne secretarv lammiuy to ex ecute the law, and to afford a fair trial to the meas ure. In tbe present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate busi ness and industry of every description will be best promoted ny auswuning iroiu all attempts to umne radical changes in the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the couutry will be undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that the resump tion of specie payments, which will take place at tue appointed time, will be successfully and easuy maintained, and that it will be followed by a health- liii and enduring -rvivai of business prosperity. Let the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our people, and the boundless resources of our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief from present ditliculties will surely follow. The report of the Secretary of .War shows the army has been well aud economically supplied; that our small force has been actively employed, and has faithfully performed all the eervice re- QTiircd of it. The morale of the army has improve' and the number of desertions has materially de creased during the year. The Secretary recommends 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry JI. Benner, Eighteenth In fantry, who lost-his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with supplies for tbe relief of eullerera in the Soutii from mat disease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benetit of the heirs of deceased officers, as sug gested bv the Paymaster General. 3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the punncation oi tne records or tne vt ar or the Re bellion, now being prepared for that purpose. 4. The increase of the extra per diein of sol flier-teachers employed in iost-scbHls. and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings lor schools and libraries at tue dinvrciit posts. 5. Tho repeal or amendment of the act of June 18,1878, forbidding the "use of the army as a ws8e comitatus. or otherwise, for the purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under sucu circumstances as may be expressly author ize! by the Constitution or by act of Congress," 6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing tne issues ot rations, tents and medi cines, which were made for the relief of sufferers from yeliow fever. 7. That provision be mado for the erection of fire-proof building for the preservation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to de- Birucnon oy nre. These recommendations are all commended to your lavorabie consideration. The report of the Secretary of the Naw shows that the navy has improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on seveuty-five vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired, and maae reaay ior sea. iwo otuers are in rapid progress towards completion. The total exjeudi- tures oi tue year, including tne amount appropri ated ror tne dencieccies or tne previous year, were $17,468,392 65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,300,914 09, or $767,199 13 less than those of the previous year, and $1,928,677 74 less than the expenses, including the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal yearendiujr June 30. ISaO, are $14,562,381 45 exceeding the appro priations of the present year only $33,949 75; which excess is occasioned by tho demands of the Pi avai Academy and tne Marine Uorps, as explained in the Secretary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14,528,431 70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all tbe current expenses of tlie Department during me year, xue amount orawn rrom tue Treasury from July 1, to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544 14, of which $70,980 75 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,669,563 39, or $520,699 24 less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. The report of the Postmaster General embraces a detailed statement of the operations of the Post- ottice Department. The expenditures of that De partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1873, were $34,165,034 49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, monev-order business and official stamps, were $29,277,516 95. The sum of $290, 436 90, Included in the foregoing statement of ex penditures, is chargeable to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures for the fiscal vear end ed June 30, 1878. are $33,874,647 50. Tbe amount drawn rrom tne lreasury on appropriations, in ad dition to tbe reveuues of the Department, was $5,307,652 82. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are estimated at $36,- o i,ytH, ana tue receipts rrom an sources at $30, 664.023 90. leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876 10. The report calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads for carrying tbe mail is regulated by law, and that the failure of Con gress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes docs not relieve tho Government of responsibility, but necessarily increase the de ficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass. in providing for the postal service, the following questions are presented: Should Congress annu ally appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in exoess of its reveuues, or should such rates of postage be established as will make the Depart ment self-sustaining? Should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way Should the number of poot routes be diminished? Should other tne t hods be adopted which will increase the revenues or dimin- lsn tne expenses of the postal service! The International Postal Congress, which mt at Paris May 1, 1373, and continued iu session un til Juno 4 of the same vear. was comiosed of del egates from nearly all the civilized couatnes of tne wono. it adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne October 9, 1874; which goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratified and approved by aud with the consent of the President August 13, 1873. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Con vention will be found in the report of the Postmas ter general, and tue iuu text in the appendix thereto. In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three countries, having a population of three hundred and fifty millions of people. On the 1st of April next it wiil comprise forty-three coun tries and colouies. with a population of more than six hundred and fifty millions of people, aud will soon, by the accession of the few remaining coun tries and colonies which maintain organized postal services, constitute, in fact as well as in name, as us new title indicates, a universal Union, regulat ing, upon a uniform basis of cbein imfstjt"A nttaa- the postal intercourse between all civilized Nations. Some embarrassment bas arisen out of the con flict between the customs lawa of this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention, in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspa pers to this country by mail. It is hoped that Con- , cress will be able to devise some means of recon ciling the difficulties which have thus been created, so aa to do justice to all parties involved. i The business of the Supreme Court, and of the ! Courts in many of the circuits, has increased to! such an extent during the past years that addi-1 tional legislation is imperative to relieve aud pre-! vent the delay of justice and possible oppression to i suitors, which is thus occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented anew I in tbe report of the Attorney General, and Hia remedy suggested is earnestly urged fur Congres sional action. The creation of additional Circuit Judges, as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense at the present rate of salaries of not more than nixtv thousand dollars a year. Ihe annual reports of the Seeretarvof the Tn. terior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. present an elaborate accouut of tbe present condi tion of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of the udhc service wnicn ministers to their interests, f bile the conduct of the Indians, cenerallv. Iirs been orderly, and their relations with their neigh bors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in their character, but remained, banmlv. cnntfnrMl tn m. comparatively small number of Indians. The dis content amoug the Bauuocks, which led first to some acts of violeuce on the part of some tnem- oers or tue trine and Dually to the outbreak, ap pears to have been caused bv an iiianrn- cieucy of food on the reservation, and this Insuffi ciency to nave been owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations, made bv Congress, to the wants of the Indians, at a time when the Indians were pre vented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United States, and several engagements, the hos tile Indians were reduced to subjection, and the larger part of them surrendered themselves as prisoners, in tnis connection. I desire to call at tent ion to the recummeudation made by tbe Secre tary of the Interior, that a sufiioieut fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion, in sudden emergencies of the Indian service. 'Ihe otner cose of disturbance wss that of a Imnrt of Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in tbe direction of their old huuting grounds, com mitting murders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with the necessaries of life as tho four thousand seven hundred other Indians who remained quiet ly on the reservation, aud that the disturuam- ; was caused by men of a restless and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost ! the whole of this band have surrendered to the 'i military authorities, and it Is a gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken refuge in the I camp vi mo ki Lioud sionx, with wbom they had leeu iu inendly relations, the Sioux held th prisoners, and readily gave them up to tne olhYcrs of the I'nltcd States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit whieb, alarming rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishos they expressed at the Council of September, 1877, had been complied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and tbe Secre tary or v ar unite in tne recommendation tnat pro vision be made by Congress for the organization of a corps of mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be un der the control of tho army, aud to be used for the purpose of keeping the" Indiaus on their reserva tions and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly concurin this recommenda tion. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment un der the Government, it being a mat ter of experience that Indians m our ser vice almost without exception are faithful in the performance of tbe duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army iu the accomplishment of a task for which it numer ical strength is sometimes found insufficient. But, while the employment of force for the pre vention or repression of Indian troubles is of occa sional necessity, aud wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called the Indian problem. It may be very difficult, and require much patient effort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized lite, but ex perieuce shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes .which are now quiet and orderly and self-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam over the Plains or in the mountainsof the Far West, and ware then considered inaccessible to civilizing in- nuences. it may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white population of the cuiiea crates, out we snouid not lorget that tney are the aborigines of the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grown ncn. powerrui aud nappy, we owe It to them moral duty to help them in attaining at least that degree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It is not only our duty it is alt) our Interest to do so. Indians who navo become agriculturists or herdsmen, aud feel an interest in property, w ill thenceforth cease to be a warlike and disturbing element. It is also a well-authenticated fact that Jndiuns are apt to be peaceable aud quiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the ex pressions of Indians themselves nnd from many concurring reports, that there Is a steadily increas ing desire, even among Indians belonging to com paratively wild tribes, to have their children edu cated. I invite attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior aud the Com missioner of Indian A 11 airs, touching the expeiimcnt recemlj- inaugurated. In t fifty Indian children, bo s and gills, from dill tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural institute, m irginia. where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in agri culture and other usetul work, to be returned to their tribes, after the completed course, as interpre ters, instructors and examples. It is reported that me onicer cnargeu wnn tne selection ot those chil dren might have had thousands of young Indians sent wmi liiiu uau it neen possible to make pro vision for them. I agree with the Secretary of the interior in saying thafthe result of this interest ing experiment, if favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advancement of civilization among the Indians." The question whether a change In the control of the Indian service should be made was, at the last session of Congress, referred to a committee for in quiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I venture to express the hope that iu the decision of so important a question the views expressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it mav be. will arrest fur ther agitation on this subject, such agitation being apt to prouuoe a disturbing enect upon tne service as well as ou the Indians themselves. In the enrollment of the bill making appropria tions for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As the Commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the mauy counUctiug claims, the suspension of their labors, before de termining the rights of the claimants, threatened, for a time, to.embarrass the interests, not only of the Government, hut also of a large number of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning contem plated improvements. Iu order to prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and at the solicitation of many leading citi zens of Hot Sprlugs, and others interested in the welfare of the to wn, the Secretary of the In terior was authorized to request the late Commis sioners to take charge of the records of . their pro ceedings and to periorm such work as could prop erly be done by them under such circumstances, to facilitate the future adjudication of tbe claims at an early day, and to preserve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally de termined. The late Commissioners complied with that request, and report that the testimony in ail the cases has been written out, examined, briefed and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the requisite authority be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair compen sation be allowed the late C ommissioners for the expense incurred and the labor performed by them since the 25th of June last. I invite the attention of Congress to tbe recom mendations made by the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber on the public lands of the United States. The protec tion of the public property is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department of the In terior should, therefore, be enabled by sufficient appropriations to enforce the laws in that respect But this matter appears still more important as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest i-oiiBciiiit-nt.-r'o, c-Diitri-ittiij iu luo luouuiaiiioas dis tricts, where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There tbft in. jury, onco done, can not be repaired. I fully concur wuii mo oeureiary or me interior m tho opinion that, for this reason, legislation touching the publio timber in the mountainous States and Territories of the West, should be espec ially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruction of the forests is not suffi ciently guarded against, should be speedily modi fied. A general law concerning this imiHirtant sub ject appears to me to be a matter of urgent publio From the organization of the nnvprnmrni Hia importance of emwuraging. by all possible means, the increase of our agricultural productions has been acknowledged and urged unon the attention of Congress and the people as the surest and readi est means or increasing our substantial and endur ing prosperity. l tie words of Washington are as applicable to day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said: 'it is not to be doubted that with reference either to individual or National welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as Nations ad vance n population and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent, and reuueiH uic cultivation or tne soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported by tbe public purso and to what object can it bededicated with greater propriety Among the means which have been employed to this end. none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of Boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist the spirit of dis covers' and improvement, this species of establish ment contributing doubly to the increase of im provement by stimulating to enterprise and ex periment, and by drawing to a common center the results every wnere or individual skill and observa tion, and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly hath shown that tley are verv cheao instrumnntH nf lnmeiKA National benefit." The great preponderance of the agricultural over any other iuterest in tho United States entitles it to all tbe consideration claimed for it by Washing ton. About one-half of the population of the United States is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural prod uctji of the United States for the year 1878. is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. The exports of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of the Bureau of Statistics, were five hun dred and twenty-four million of dollars. The great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own borders, and by our own labor, not only the necessaries but most of the luxuries that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad vantages of soil, climate, and intercommunication. it appears from the statistical statements in the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we Import annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products wnicn could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise In the practice of ad vanced agriculture which can only be answered by experiments, often costly, and sometimes fruit less, which are beyond the means of private indi viduals, and are a Just and proper charge on the whole Nation for the benefit of the Nation. It is good policy, especially tn times of de pression and uncertainty In other busi ness pursuits, with a vast area of uncul tivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage, by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of tbe Depart- ment of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new agricultural industries, to improve the quali ty and increase the quantity of our products, to determine tho value of old or establish tho im portance of new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful and favorable consideration, and as sistance by such appropriations of money and en largement of facilities as may seem to bedenianded by the present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this important interest. Tbe abuse of animals in transit is widelv attract ing public attention. A National Convention of oocieues Bpeiriaiiy interested m ine sunjeet nas re cently met at Baltimore, nnd the facts developed, both in regard to cruelties to animals "and tho ef fect of such cruelties upon the public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Con press, and the enactment of more etiiclent laws for the prevention of these abuses. The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifying progress through out ti'o cot ntry, in all the interests commit ted to ti.v ;; pro ill1 of tl,e . 'i this important otllco. The renort is es- i'ncoiiraging with respect to the extension I; f.ntnges of the common school system, in of the coiin'.ry where tho general euloy- he privilege of the free schools Is nut yet m ut (i at ' ;iil.f To ei a:ion nit.re than to nnv other agency we nre to look a- the resource for the advancement of the people, i:i the requisite knowledge and appre ciation of their rights and responsibilities as citi zens, and I desire to repeat tho suggestion con- tained in my former message In behalf of the euactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the purpose of supplementing, with National aid, the local systems of education in the several States. Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing tbe capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, should be provided without further delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts and illus trative arts has grown to such proportions, in connection with the copyright system of the conn try, as to demand the prompt and careful attention of Congress, to save it from injury in its present crowded and inefficient quarters. As this library is National in its character, and must, from the na ture of the case, increase even more rapidly in the luture man m tue past, it can not be doubted tnat tho people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. The anneal of the Resents of the Smithsonian Institution for the means to organize, exhibit and make available for the public benetit the articles now stored away belonging to the National Muse um, i neartny recommend to your lavorabie con sideration. The attention of Congress is again Invited to the condition of the river front of the city of ' Washing ton. It is a matter of vital importance to the health of the residents of the National Capital. both temporary and permanent, that the low lands in rront or tue city, now subject to a tidal overuow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition. these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a dangerous source of malarial poison. The re clamation will improve the navigation of the river, by restricting and consequently deepening its channel; and is also of importance, when consid ered in connection with the extension of tho public ground and tho enlargement of the park, west and south of tne Washington Monument. The report of the Board of Survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on the' improvement of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respect fully commended to consideration. The report of the Commissioners of the District oi ( oiumtun presents a detailed statement or the affairs of the District. The relative expenditures by the United States and the District for local purposes Is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by tho people of the District greatly exceed those of the General Gov ernment. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the defective pavements and sewers of the city, which U a work of immediate necessity, and in the same connection a plan is presented for the permanent funding of the outstanding securities of the District. The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institu tions of the District are all entitled to the favora ble attention of Congress. The Reform School needs additional buddings and teachers. Appro priations which will place all of these institutions in a condition to become models of usefulness aud benetieence, will be regarded by tho country aa liberality wisely bestowed. The Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the discrimination made by Congress against the District in the donation of land for tiie support of the public schools, and ask that the same liberality that bas been 6howu to the inhab itants of the various States and Territories of the United States may be extended to the District of Columbia. The Commissioners also invite attention to the damage in file ted upon public and private interests by the present location of. the depots and switching-tracks of tbe several railroads entering the ciiy, and ask for legislation looking to their re moval. The recommendations and suggestions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the careful consideration of Congress. Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization of the government of the Dis trict, under tho recent legislation of Congress, for tho expression of a confident opinion as to its suc cessful operation; but the practical results already attained are so satisfactory that the friends of the new government may well urge, upon Congress the wisdom of its continuance, without essential modi fication, until, by actual experience, its advan tages and defects may be more fullv ascertained.

The revenues" of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, estimated upon existing laws, will he Total ordinary receipts $2b4,500,0O The est imate of expenditures for the sa;n period, received from the several Executive Departments, are as follows: Total estimated expenditures, in c lading sinking fund $275,137,250 04 Or an estimated deficit of. $10,GJ7,250 94 Excluding the Sinking Fund, the estimated ex penditures wiil be j:lfi,334,912 C8, showing a surplus of 28,165,087 32. By direction of the President, the estimated ex penditures for the next fiscal year have been based unon the appropriations made by Congress for the present fiscal year. The rule bas been departed from only as to those branches of the public ser vice belnngiiisr to Departments the bends of which deem tho estimated increase indispensable, or where existing law demands a pre .iter sum than was appropriated, tiucn increase is estimated lor as follows: Iveci.j'iattve.

In tlie sum of 778.4 !2 2 1. and herein recommends chances of the lnw which will enable him to msike further reductions t hero in. Tbe prent body of expenditures is fixed by laws w hi eh leave no discretion to executive officers. The reduction of appropriations does not reduce expenditures when the law requires tlie service to be performed, or fixes the salary and number of employes. It must be accompanied by a careful revisiuu of the laws, red ucmpf the obfeets of ex penditure or the number or compensation of em ployes. It is believed that, by su: h a revision, especially of the postal lawa, niul by a limitation of the amount of appropriations for public works iu progress, by the postponement of new works not indispensable for tbe public service, and b judi cious scrutiny of disbursements, that the expendi tures for the next fiscal year need no:, in the a pre irate, exceed the appropriations for the present fiscal year. The estimate of revenue, based upon existing law, is $6,73(1.121 30 metre than the actual revenue of the past year. This estimate can only be real ized by strict and impartial enforcement of the revenue laws. This is not only a leiral duty of rev enue otlieers, but is the ripht of every honest tax payer. The enforcement of the tax on spirits and tobacco has, iu some places, been resisted by formidable combinations too powerful for the department, "wiib the forces at its com mand, to overcome. The customs dnties, tu many cases, have been evaded by smnpglinp, fraud, undervaluation and false claims for drawbacks and damnpe allowance. Some of these obstructions are incident to the execution of any tax law, but many of them may be overcome by such modifications of the laws as are hereinaf ter recommended. It is manifest, from these estimates, that, how ever desirable it may bo to reduce existing taxes, it ou'bt not now to be done except by supplying the reductions from other sources of revenue. Sta bility and certainty in the rate'and subject of taxa tion are of great importance, and, therefore, the Secretary recommends that no change be made in them during the present session, except to convert certain ad valorem duties, hereinafter stated, Into specific duties. 

RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS. The Important duty Imposed on this Department by the Resumption Act. approved January 14. 1875, has been steadily pursued difnng tbe pat year. The plain purpose of the act is to secure to all interests and all classes the benefits of a sound currency, redeemable in coin, with the least possi ble disturbance of existing rights and contracts. Three of its provisions have been substantially car ried into execution by the gradual substitution of fractional coin for fractional currency, by the free coinage of gold, and by free banking. There re mains only the completion of preparations for re sumption in coin on the 1st day of January, 187y, and its maintenance thereafter on the basis of ex isting law. At the date of my annual report to Congress In December, 1877, it was deemed necessary as a preparation for resumption to accumulate In the Treasury a coiu reserve of at least forty ier cent, of the amount of United States notes outstanding. At that time it was anticipated tnat under the pro visions of tho Resumption act the volume of United States notes would be reduced to 3,'0,00o,000 by the 1st day of January, 1879, or soon there after, and that a reserve in coin of $12(,000,000 would then be sufiioieut. Congress, however, tn view of the strong popular feeling against a con traction of the currency, by the act approved May 31, 1878. forbade the retirement of any United States notes after that dure, leaving thb amouut In circu lation $346,681,016. Upon the principle of safety upon which the Department was acting, that forty per cent of coin was the smartest reserve upon which rosumptieu could prudently be commenced, it became necessary to increase tho coin reserve to $i3$.oo,ot;o. At tiie close of the year 1877 this coin reserve, hi excess of coin liabilities, amounted to $63,016, 050 i6, of which $15,000,000 were obtained bv the sale of four ami a half per cent., and $25,000, OOO by the sale of four per cent, bonds, tbe residue being surplus revenue. Subsequently, on tue 11th day of April. 1878, the Secretary entered into a contract with certain bunkers in New York and London the parties t the previous con tract of June 0, 1S77, already oommuuic:tt ed to Congress for the sale of $50,OiH,00 four and a half jier cent, bonds for resumption purposes. Tho bonds wero sold at a premium of one and a half per cent, and uccrued interest, less commission of one-half of one per cent. Tbe con tract h:is been fulfilled, and tho net proceeds. $50. 500,00' , have been paid into ihe Treasury in gold co:u. The $o,500,lx0 com paid on tbe Halifax award have been replaced by the sale of that amount of four per cent, bonds sold for resniui tion purposes, making tho agreg;ire amount of bonds sold for these purpo.-es $15,500,000, oi wnicn to.),(mm,uou were lour aim a hair per cent, bonds. S;0.50"0.(M0 four per cent, bonds. To t'ns has been added the surplus reveuue from time to time. The amount of com held in the Treasury on the 23d day of November last, in excess of coin suilieient to pay uil accrued coin liabilities, was $141,888,100, and constitutes the cota reserve prepared for re sumption purposes. Tins sum will be diminished somewhat on the 1st of January next by rear on of the largo amount of interest fuvruing o"n that day excess of the cum revenue received mean while. In anticipation of resumption, and in view of the fact that tiie redemption of United States notes is muudatory only at the office or the Assistant Treas urer in the city of New York, it was deemed im portant to secure the co-oir-U iou of the associated bauks of that citv in the ready collection of drafts on those banks and in the payment of Treasury drafts held by them. A satisfactory ar rangement has been made by which ail drafts on tlie banks held by the Treasury are to be paid at tbe Clearing-house, Ld all drafts on the Treasury held by them are to be paid to the Clearing-house the olhee of the AsMstunt Treasurer, in United States notes; and, after the 1st of January, United States notes are to be received by them as coin. Tbis will greatly lessen the risk and labor of col lections, both to tho Treasury and tue banks. Every step in these preparations for resumption has beeu accompanied with increased business and confidence. Tho accumulation of coin, instead of increasing its price, as was feared by many, bas steadly reduced its premium iu the market. The depressing and ruinous louses that followed the panic of 1873 had not diminished iu 1875, when the Resumption Act passed; but every measure taken In the execution or enforcement of this act bus tendered to lighten these losses, and reduce the premium on coin, so that now. it is merely nominal. The pres eut condition of our trade, indiistiy and commerce, hereafter more fully stated, our ample reserves, and the general confidence inspired In our financial condition seem to Justify the opinion that we are prepared to commence and maintain resumption from and after the first day of January, A.D. 1879. The means and manner of doing this are left largely to the discretion of the Secretary, but, from the nature of the duty imKed, he must re store coin and bullion, when withdrawn in the pro cess of redemption, either by tbe sale of bonds, or the use of the surplus revenue, or of the notes re deemed from time to time. The power to sell any of the bonds described in the Reiunding Act continues after aswell as before resumption. Though it may not be often used, it essential to enable this Department to meet emergencies, liy its exercise it is anticipated that the Treasury at any time cau readily obi-am coin reinforce the reserve already accumulated. United States notes must, however, be the chief menus under existing law with which tne Depart ment must restore coin and bullion when withdrawn in process of ro demption. The notes, when redeemed, must necessarily accumulate in the Treasury until their superior use and convenience for circulation ena bles the Department to exchange them at par fur coin or bullion. The act of May 31, 1878, already referred to, provides that when United States notes are re deemed or received in the Treasury under any law, from any source whatever, and shall belong to tlie United Slates, they shall not be retired, canceled, destroyed, but shall be reissued aud paid out again and kept in circul ition. 'Ihe power to rei.-fiie United States notes whs conferred by Section "570, Revised Statutes, and was not limited by the Resumption Act. As this, however, was questioned, Congress wisely remov ed the doabt. Jiutes redeemed are liLe other notes received Into
