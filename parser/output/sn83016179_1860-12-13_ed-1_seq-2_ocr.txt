The political and financial aspects of the country arc still of the most gloomy i character; occasionally souic small raj of hopo breaks over the profound dark ness in the patriotic speech or letter of some true lover of his country, yet vrc see no hope for the jieservntlou of the Union. South Curolina and Bva or six other states will socode, and perhaps,at tempt to form a Southern confederacy, or they may put themselves in a position to haTg guaranteed to them their full and unquestionable rights, and thus again harmonise the States, and present to the world a strong and invinciblo people. Maryland occupies by no means an en viable position, in a dissolution, should it comprehend a scpcration of all the slave States from the free we would form the northorn boundary of the southern government, and bo exposed to number less annoyances to say the least of it, in regard to our slavu property, and which might ultimately result in making Mary land a free state, It bohoovos us there fore to do all in our power to prescrvo the Union, —to perpetuato tho confedoraoy. Interest,to say nothing of patriotism,do mands this at our hands. The idea thorofore of a dissolution of tho govern ment should racoivo no countonanoo.uiuch Isssaid and support from our hands,with ono voice we should denounce tho trea son and uphold the governuiout, for wo fully boliovo all our wrongs can and will bo redressed, and harmony and good will restored between the soctions.

A more ansplcious morning for the open ing of the second session of the SOtU Congress oould not have bosn desired. Tbe attraction of the weather, a genial sue. the universal iutorest, tht large Influx of strangers, ail combined to call out upon Penn sylvania Avenue at an oatly hour such a throng as made it wsur.a must lively ap psaranco. / Mem burs were so in taslr arrival that np to a lato hour of thoovsnlng previoue. ap prehensions ware felt and expressed that qwrrum would not ha found to respond at roll-call. , Yet long bofore ths hour (1) to.) had arrived for prooeoditig to busiuoas, both Halls were well tilled—exhibiting nearly the £'.il strength of each. The Ladios and Gen tlemen! gallarlea of both Houses presonted a moat animating seeue, filled as tbey wore to replctioo with spectators uf both sexes. Por full two hours tho floor of the House was busy with tho hum of congrstulstiou aud bands shaking between the various metnbtrs —the most uoticesbla feature of which was its indiscriminate character, being confined to neither parties nor sectious. Men from the South met tboso of the North with apparent ly even more of that cordiality and good feel ing than was wont to bo exhibited fur the last several years. No one coulJ detect in these interchanges and sallies the alightost manifestation of that alienation and bitter uess upon wblch had boon predicted scenos of immediate strife, oventuating In a separa tion and leading to the disintegration and fi nal dismemberment of tbe Federal Union. Precisely at 12 M., both Houses were call ed to order by their respective presiding of ficers aiid| fervent and uloquont prayers put up to a Throne of Grace by tho Chaplains of each.

Either because of disaeuaiutt between the President and kii adviaera, or from a desire to keep the country in tweuty-foar hours lon ger suspense, or for the purpose of affording mora time to the plotters of Irtcuon, It was understood that neither Con press or the Coun try could be gratified with the Mes.age be fore Tuesday. Accordingly, after the ap pointment of a joint Committee to tnfoiin his Excellency that both bodice were organised and prepared to receive any communication he might with to make, each Donee thereup on adjourned.

But whilst hearing witness to the style in which it was rtad candor ex torts the wnfeaaion that in my judgement it is the most pernicious document that ever em anated from an Executive in this Nation.- If its theory as to secession be the true ouc then Indeed is our Federal Union held to gether by a rope of sand Already we see in this per vartion, truckling and time serving, an exemplification of the never varying truth of history, that he who is brave euotigb to pander to tbem, whilst he does not secure tho confidence of either section, he at the seme time forfeit! the respect of both. Thus it he President justly denounced by the friends of the Union beoaute he canuot find in the COD atitutlon or taws acy warrant lor Its preser vation, while the seceeeionistt handle Idm none the lese roughly because he advices a galnst that which he says he has no powsr to prevent.

OCCASIONAL ; The President s Message. We received tho message of the President j too late to give any part of it in our issue of j last week—its length jirechides the possibility I of oublishing it entire and therefore we give the following synopsis: Tht President commences by staling that the country has enjoyed much providential blessing and material prosperity during the year, and asks why the country is filled with discontent 7 He answers promptly and deci dedly, ami makes corresponding suggestions; The long continued and intemperato inter ference of the Northern people with tho question of slavery in the Southern States has at length produced its natural effects. The different sections of the Union nre now arrayed against each other, aud the time has arrived, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, when hostile geographical par ties have been formed. 1 have long foreseen and often forewarned tny countrymen of the now impending danger. This does not pro ceed aolely from the claim on the part of Congress or the Territorial Legislatures to ex clude slavery from the territories, nor from the efforts of differeut States to defeat the ex ecution of tho fugitive slavo law. All or any of those evils might have been endured by'tho South without the Union, (as othensf' have bceu,) in tlie hope that time and reflec tion might apply the remedy. The imme diate peril arises not HO much fromf tln SE causes as from the fact that the and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the North for the lafst quarter of a century, has at length produced its malign intluruco on the slavea, and inspired thorn with vague notions of/freedom, llence a sense of security no longer exists around tho family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place tu / apprehensions of servile insurrection. Many a matron throughout tho South routes at night in dread of what may befall hwrself and her children before the morning, Should this apprehension of do mastir/ianger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify itself until it ahull per r.de tho masses of the Southern people, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-pro- I eervatiou is the first law of nature, and lias beeu implanted in the heart of man by his Croator for tho wisest purpose; and no po litical union, however fraught with blessings eud benefits in all other respects, can lung coutiuue, if the necessary consequence he to render the homes and firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly in secure. Sooner or Inter the bonds of such a Union must be severed. It is my conviction that tins fatal period has not yet arrived ; and my prayer to God is that Ho would pre serve tho UoUßtitutiou and tkeUuion through out all generations. Hut lot us take warning in time, ami remove the cause of tlauger. It cannot bo tloniod that, for fivo and twenty year*, tho agitation ut the North against slnvory in the South has been in cessant. 'ln 1535 pictorial hand-bills, and in flam mat cry appeals, were circulated extensively throughout tho South, of a charuetor to oxcito the passions of tho slaves ; and, iu tho language of General Jackson, ''to stimulate tlieui to insur rection, and produce all the horrors of a forvile war." This agitation has over aiuce been con tinued by tho public press, by the proceedings of State and county conventions, and by abolition seriuous und lectures. The tiiuo of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on this never-ending subject; and appouls in pamphlet and other forms,en iorsed by distinguished nuuies Imvojboen sent forth from this central point, and spread broadcast over the Union. How easy would It ho for tho American poo plo to sottlo tb slavery question forever, and to restore peace end hnruiony to this distracted country. They, and they alone, Can doll. All that is necessary to accomplish the object, aid all for which the slave States have ever contended, is to be let alone, and permitted to manage their domestic institutions in their.own way. As sov ereign States, they, and they alone, are respon sible befora Clod and the world for the slavery oxisting among thorn. For this, the people of the North are uot more tosponsiblo, und have no more right to interfere, thun with similar in slitutious in Russia or in liruzil. Upon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still greatly rely. Wtbout their uidit is be yond tho power of any President, no matter what may be his own political proclivities, to re store peace aud harmony among tho States.— iViselv limited and restrained us is his power under tho Constitution and laws, ho alone cu, accomplish hut llttlo, for good or fo. evil, on such a momentous question. The Preside'lit thou declares that the election of a President by constitutional process, is uot a sufficient ground for dissolving the Union, and argues at,length against tho doctrine of .South Carolina en this question, With regard to the right of accession, .Mr. Buchanan expresses him self very clearly. He admits no such right, and declares secession and revolution to be synony mous terms. Iri order to Justify seofssleu as a constitution al remedy, it must bo on the principle that the Pedsrul tiovorntnetit is u mere voluntary associa tion of Slates to he dissolvod at pleasure by any one of tits sontractiug parties. If litis he so. tho Confederacy is a rope of aund, to he pene trated and dissolved by tbe first adverse wave of publie opinion in auy of tho States. In this tuanuar our thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as tunny petty, jarring, and hos tile republics, eieb otto retiriug from the I'uion, with, ut responsibility, whenever any sudden ex citement might impel theui to such a course.— I!y this proven the Union might be entirely bro ken into fragmcuta in a few weeks, which cost our forefathers many y vara of toil,prrvatieu, and blood to establish. Such a principal it wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of tho Federal Constitution. After it was fra med, with the greatest deliberation and care, it was submitted to conventions of tlie peo ple of the several States lorjt ratification- Its provision* were diacuued at length in these bodits, rompoeed of the first men of the coun try. Its opponents? contended that it con ferred powers upon the Federal Government dangerous to the rights of the States, whilst its advocates maintained that under a fair construction of thu instrument tliere was no foundation for aocii apprehensions. In that mighty struggle between the first intellecta of this or any other country, it never occur red to any individual, either among its oppo nents or advocates, to assart, or even to in timate, that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that any fState felt her self aggrieved siiu might secede from the Un ion. What a crushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the lights of the .States would bo eudangered by the Constitution. The truth is. that it was not until many yeare after the origin of the Federal Uovernrnent that such a propo sition was first advanced. It was then met and then refuted by the conclusive arguments of General Jackson, who in hie message of lfiih January. 1833, transmitting the nulli fyiag ordinance of South Csroliua to Con gress, employee the following language : "The right of the people of a singlu State to absolve themselves st will, and without the content of the other States, from their moat solemn obligations, and iiaeard the liberty and happiness of the millions composing this Union, cannot lis acknowledged. Such au thority is believed to ks utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the Qen eral Government is constituted and tojthe ob jects which it was expressly formed to at tain-" It is not pretended tint any clause in the Constitution gives countenance to such s the ory. It isaltogetber founded upon inference, | not from soy language cootaiued in the In strument itself, but from the sovereign oher scuer (he seve-sl STatvv bv wtifvfc it wts ratified. Hot is it beyond the power of a State, like an individual, to yield a portion ol its sovereign rights to secure tho remain-1 der 7 In tho language of Mr. Madison, who has been called the far her of the Constitution: • It was formed by the Stairs—that is, by the people in each of tlie States, acting' in their highest sovereign capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the State constitutions." "Nor is the Government of tho United States, created by the Constitution, less a Government in the strict ssnao of a term, within tho sphere of its powers, than tho governments created by the constitutions of the States are, within their several spheres. It is, like them, organized into legislative, exacut'iTe, and judiciary departments. It op erates, like them, directly on persons and things; and, like thein, it has at command a physical force of executing tho powers com mitted to it." It was intended to be ptrpctual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure ofjany one of the sontracting parties. Tiio old articles ol confederation ware entitled "Articles of Con federation and Perpetual Union between 'lie States;" and by the 13th article it is expressly declared that "tho articles of this Confedera tion shall he inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall bo perpetual.'' The preamble to the Constitution of the United States, having express rcferonco to the articles of Confederation, recites that it was established "in order to form a more perfect nuion.,, And yet it is contended that this "more perfect union" dues not include the essential atributc of perpetuity. , With regard to tho duty of the Mr' Buchanan says he is sworn to sco /We laws oxeeutod, ami he will do so as fa/as he can—But as the whole machinerv/of tire Federal Government is brokeu ujpin South Carolina, except so far an the .Collection of revenue is concerned, he c/in do nothing more than enforce the collection. Fort Moultrie having been bought aud paid for by the government, tho President intends to hold it against any hostile pac tion, and lias given orders to that effect to the officer iu •onmia'ud. This President nrgues that Congress has no power, howfcvur, to force a state to remain in tlio Union'ami ahows that if Congress bad such pifwer, it would he foolish to exorcise it. lie says: ,'Vim question fairly stated is: Flas the Con stitution delegated to Congress tho power to [coerce a .Stateinto submission which is at tempting to withdraw, or has actually with drawn lruni tl.o Confederacy ? If answered iu the aflirmative, it must bo ou tho principle that the power has boon couferred upon Con gress to declare and to make war against a State. After much serious reflection, 1 have arrived at the conclusion that no such power iias been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the Federal Government. It is manifest, upon an inspection of the Constitution, that this is not among the spe cific und enumerated powers granted to Con gress; and it is equally apparent tiiat its ex ercise is not "necessary and proper for carry ing into execution" any one of these powers. So far from this power having been delegated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the convention which framed tho Constitution. It appears from the proceedings of that body, that en the 31st May, 1787, the clause "authorizing un exertion of the forte of the whole againet a delinquent State f came up for consideration .Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but powerful speech, from which 1 shall extract hut a single sentence, lie ob served: "The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment; and would probably be considered by tbe party attacked as a dissolution of previous com pacts by which it might be bound." Upon his motion tho clause was unanimously pot pouded, and was never I bolieve again pre sented. Soon afterwards, on the Bth June, 1787, when incidentally adverting to the sub ject, lie said: Any Government for the Uni ted Slates, formed on the supposed practica bility of using force againsts the unconstitu tional proceeding of the States, would prove as visionary and fallacious as the Government uf Congress, evidently meaning the then ex isting Congress of the old Confederation. Without descending to particulars, it may be safely asserted, that the power to make war againrt" a Stats is at variance with tiie spirit and the intent of the Constitution. Suppose such a war should result in the eon quest of a State, how are we to govern it af terwards? Shall we held it ns a province, and govern it by despotic power? In the nature of tilings we could not, by physical force, control the will of the people, and sompel them to elect senators an 1 represenntives to Congress, anil to perform all the other duties depending upon their owu volition and re quired fri m the free citizens of a free Slate 1 as a constituent member of the Confederacy. | ISut, if we poscsscd this power, would it be ! wise to exercise it under the existing circum stances ? i.w object would doubtless be to preserve the Union. W lir would not only present the most effectual means of destroy - | ing it—but would banish all hope of it. peaceful reconstruction, besides, in the fra ternal conllict a vast amount of blood and ' treasure would be expended, rendering future reconciliation between tho States impossible. 11l the meantime, whocau furteii what tvuuld bo tho sufferings and privations of the peo ple during its existence? The fact is. that our Union rests upon pub lic opinion, anil can never he cemented by the blood of i!s citizens in civil war. If it canuot live in the affections of tho people, it must one day perish. Congress poscsaes many means uf preserving it by conciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hands to preserve it by force. The President then makc6 a warm and pa- tiiotic uppv.il to his countrymen to save the Union, ami propones for action the following plan: Hut may 1 lie pormitlxl solemnly to in voke my country men to pause an J deiiber atc. before iliey (leterriiiue to destroy this, the grainiest temple winch has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began ? It lias been consecrated by the liio.n! of our fathers, by the glories of the past and by !ft' hopes of the future, 'l'lie Union has already made ua tha most prosperous, and ere Jlong, will, if preserved, render us the most powerful nation on tho face of the earth. In every foreign regiou on the globe the title of American citizen is he'd in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest pride.— Surely when wo reach the brinkoftheyawn ing abyss, we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge. By such a dread ca tastrophe the hopes of the friends of freedom llirougout the world would bedeatroyed, and a long night of leaden despotism would en shroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty years would not only be los : but it would bo quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government. It is not every wrong—liay, it it not every grieviour wrong—which can justify a resort so such a fearful alternative. This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted. Weshould retlect that under this free Government there ss an incessant ebb and flow in the public c pinion. The Slavery question, like every thing human, will have its day. I firmly believe that it has already reached and passed the culminating point. Itutif, in the midst of the existing excitement, the Union shall, perish, the evil then may become irreparable. Congress can contribute much to avert it In proposing and recommending to the legisla iatores of the several States the remedies lor existing evils, which the Constitution lias it aelf, provided lor its own preservation. This has been tried at different critical periods of history, and always with eminent success.— it is to bo found iu the fifth article providing for its own amendment. Under this article amendments have been proposed by two thirds of both houses of Congress and have ! been "ratified by the legislatures of tlie so-, eral States," and have consequently become | parts of the Constitution. To this process i the country is indebted for the clause prohih- j iting Congress from passing any law respect ing u establishment of religion, or abridging j the freeedom of speecli or of the press, or 01 i I the right of petition. To this we are, also, i I indebted for the Kill of Right'. which secure* the people against any abuse of power by the Federal OoTimnirnt. fin eh weie the api"" heiuioua juatly entartained by the friends of State-Rights nt that period as to have render ed it extremely dontful whether the Coneti- I tiou could have longsnrvived without these ; amendments, Again, the Oonetitntion was amended by j the same process after the election of l'resi- i deut Jefferson by the House of llcpreseun- j tives, in February ,1803. This amendment | was rendered necessary to prevent a recur- , rence of dangers which hail seriously threat- j lened the existence of the Government du ring the pendency of that election. The ar ticle for its own amendment was intended to secure the amicable adjustmentof conflicting j constitutional questions like the present. I which might arise between the governments > of the States and that of the United States.- I Tins appears from the contemporaneous his- J j tory. In this connection, 1 shall merely call attention to a few sentences in Mr. Madison's \ justly celebrated report, iu 17'J9, to the leg- , ! islaturc of Virginia. In this ho ably and i conclusivly d derided the resolution of the proceeding legislature again®! the strictures of several other State legislatures. There were mainly founded irolon t ie protest of the Virginia legislature against tho "Alion at d Sedition Acts," as "rjlalpable and alarming in fractions of the Constitution." In pointing out the peaceful and Constitutional remedies and he referred to nunc other, to which the Statoip were authorized to reaort to, on such u-easi'.ins, he concludes byeayiag, "thst the of the States might have made a direct representation toCongreis with n/v'ww to obtain the rescinding of the ttvool- fhvmvn acts, a they might have represented to their respective senators in Congress their wish tlmt two-thirds thereof would propose on explanatory amendment to tho Constitu tion, or two-thirds ef themselves, if such hid been their option, might by application to Cong mas, have obtained a convention for the object." This is the very course which I earnestly re commend in order to obtain an "explanatory amendment" of the Constitution on tho subject of slavery. This might originate with Congress or tho Sta o legislatures, as may ho deemed most advisable to attain the object. Tho explanatory amendment might bo confin el to tho final settlement of the truo construction of the Constitution on three special po'.nte: ]. An express recognition of tho right of property in slaves in the States where it now exists r may hereafter exist: '2. The duty of protecting tbia right in all the common Territories throughout their territorial uxistenec, and until they shall he admitted ns States into the Union, with or without Slavery, as their constitutions uity prescribe. 3. A like recognition cftbo right of the mas ter to hnvo his Slave, who has escaped from one State to another, restored aud "delivered up" to him, and of ths validity of the fugitive slave law enacted for this, purpose together with n declaration that all State laws impairing or de feating this right are violations ofthe Constitu tion, and are consequently null and roid. It may bo objected that this construction of the Constitution has already been settled by the Supronie Court of the United States, and what more ought to ho required ? The answer is, that a very largo proportion of the people of the Ilii'ted States still contest the correctness of this decision, and never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force until clearly established by the people of the several States in tl eir sov ereign character. Such an explanatory amend ment would, it is believed, furor* r terminate the existing dissontions and restore peace and har mony among the States- It ought not to bo doubted that such an ap peal to the orbitrameut established by the Con stitution itself would be received with favor by a?l the States of the Con fed acy. In any event it ought t. be tried in aspirit of conciliation bc foro any of theso States shall acporato them selves from the Union. The rest of the message is occupied with a report of foreign relations, in which wo find nothing of much interest. Notices.

Headaches may be classi fied under two names viz. Symptomatic and Idiopathic. Symptomatic Headache is exceed ingly common and is the precursor of a great variety of diseases, among which are Apoplexy, Gout, Rheumatism and all febrile discuses.— In its nervous form it is sympathetic of disease of the stomach constituting tick headache , of hepatic disease constituting bilious headache, of worms, constipation and other disorders of the bowels, n* well as renal and uterine a flec tions. Diseases of the heart are very frequent ly attended with Headaches; Ametuia and ple thora are also affections which frequently oc casion headache. Idiopathic Headache is also very common, being usually distinguished by the name of nervous headache, sometimes com ing on suddenly in a state of apparently sound health and prostra'ing at once tho mental and physical energies, and in other instances it conies on slowly, heralded by depression of spirits or acerbity of temper. In most instan ces the pain is in the frout of the head, over one or both eves, and sometimes provoking vomiting; under this class uioy also be named Xcuralgia.
