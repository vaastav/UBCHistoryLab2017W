SUPPOET Or THE LOCAL MEECHANT. The approach of w Liter and th holiday season, when the most import ant and largest expeuditnres on the part of every person and family takes place, calls attention to a mat ter of great consideration, for those who are to purchase these supplies. This matter is where are you, the cit izen, going to buy your goods, of your home merchant, or are you al ready sending out for catalogues from outride merchants of the great north ern cities, and figuring on saving twenty-five cents on every ten dol lar purchase f There is no greater community of interests in a town or citj, than that which is to be found in local co-operation of the people. 'It Is the senti ment put into active practice of-doing everything possih? for your neigh bor's interest. It is the good word ever ready for the city's defence. It is the ready help to promote and ad vance every local interest which means public betterments. It is found in giving the local mer chant every possible order, every pos sible dollar in trade for goods, that can be purchased in his store, or or dered through his store. The support of home institutions is hesit seen in the local patronage given every worthy local merchant. The re tail merchant, as a tax payer, is a most important supporter of every thing that makes up a municipality He is taxed for everything, and pro portionally bears the greatest bur den as a local taxpayer. This being true the local merchant deserves tlw consistent support, and every possible dollar of patronage from his home people. At this season of the year, the pam phlet by mail, .and the attractive ad in some outside periodical, is too apt to draw attention away from the local merchant. The person want ing goods very often will say what is the use of going to the local mer chant, he can't carry such goods, and so send an order to some outside mer chant. But how does the home, citi zen know that the article wanted is not to be found in town? Has the loeal newspaper been looked over, to see if the local merchant ndver- j tises, or if not having the exact ai ticle, cannot order the goods, and so make a tmall profit? Let this season be a new one for lo cal buyers, in that they make up their lists of needed goods, look up their iocal merchant and give him the first opportunity to till every order, before sending a dollar to some northern city. Let the people try thjo one sea son, and see what, the result will be. Give it a trial. TALISMANS AND CHARMS. Talismans 'and charms have their ops and downs in fashion. Just now the wearing of such "ma&cots," says "Tie Woman's Magazine," Beems to be in the ascendant. They hang from necks, they dangle from purses, they even adorn one'3 roora3. The new est charm in Paris, which is war ranted to leave joyousness in its wake, is a pot of growing shamrocks. Tho pots arc small, and, there is a great desire to get the ' four-leaved shamrocks to grow in them. Such a result, of course, is a mere question cf luck. The shamrock charm will be much sought this season and will be a popular favor for luncheons. At least Paris is looking through greea eyes at present. NO MEDICINE - But Change of FocQ Gave Final Re lief. Most diseases start in the alimen tary canal stomach and bowels. A great deal of our stomach and bowel troubles come from eating too much starchy and greasy food. The stomach do33 not digest any of Che starchy food we eat white bread, pastry, potatoes, oats, etc. these things are digested in the small in testines, and if we eat too much, as most of us do, ths organs that should digest this kind of food are overcome by excess of work, so that fermenta tion, indigestion, and a long train of ails result. Too much fat also, is hard to di gest and this is changed into acids, sour stomach, belching gas, and a bloated, heavy feeling. -- In these conditions a change from indigestible foods to Grape-Nuts will work wonders in not only relieving the distress, but " In building up a strong digestion, clear brain and steady nerves.
