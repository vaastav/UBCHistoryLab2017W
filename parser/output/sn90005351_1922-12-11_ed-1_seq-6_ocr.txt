They leiinre that they will carry tue caso to ihe supreme court on exoeptions if tho award ìp susta Ined. I luring the fi ve wecks of the trial the defence luwyer took 200 oxceptions to evidence which they tiainied was int'òmpetent ami which was adniitted over their ob jection. The defence attorneys also ciaim that the jury was influ enced by the demonstration for the lilaintiff which oceurred in the ciurtrooin at the conclusioni of her lawyer's final plea. At the time of this occurrenee they petitioned for a new trial, but were over-ruled. N'otwithstanding the vigorous efforts to prevent the plaintiff from collecting the verdiet, which is the largest ever awarded in an aliena- tion of arfections suit, both Mrs. Woodhouse and her uttorney, Warren U. Austin, are confident that the action of the jury will be upheld even if the case goes to the highest court in the country. The first art on the part of the plain tiff'. lawyer, if the verdiet is sus tained, will be to apply for a writ empowering him to jail the defen flants in event of their failui-e to puy the dama ges nssessed against them. In behulf of his client, he also will daini interest at six per cent on the .4(ì5,000, as allowed by the laws of the state. It is the contention of Atty. Aus tin that there is no question as to the ability of the defe'ndants to pay the $400,000 which the jury awarded their son's wife for actual dainages resulting from the loss of his love and society, as well as the additional $(55,000 impo.-ed as a punishment for the "malicious acts" "which induced him to leave her and go to Reno to petition for a divorce. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse is presi de nt of the Merchants National !!ank of this city and is known as the "richest man in Vermont." Be sides an imposing residence here, where he lives about two months a year, he maintains a home at i-'ì.r l'ark avenue, New York, an estate at East Hampton, Long Island and owns an island in Lake Champlnin and property in Florida, aecording to his testtmony on the witness stand during the trial. Between his stays at these place.s, he makes trip to California, White Sulphur Springs, Va., and other resorts, as well as occasionai visits to Europe. His "special account", investigated during the trial, showed assets in stocks and bonds amounting to Sl,.ri0g,0(M. The A-ealth of the Woodhouse family was blamed for the shatter ed romance between Dorrit ami Douglas. She charged that her father-in-law and mother-in-law desired their son to wed a woman with money and social position and that they "never recognized ber as a member of the family." Burlington residenti of a genera tion ago recali that Lorenzo E. Woodhouse's parent., like wise objected to his mar riage to Mary Kennedy, daughter of the agent of the Burlington tex tilo mills, but Lorenzo refused to; give up the girl of his choice and eventually she was reccived into the family circle. 

HOLD 0FF1CERS SCHOOLAT r STATE HOUSE Capt WHcox'and Lieut Iìean of St. Johnsbury Attend W. K. Cleary Raps Message of President Continued from Pace One on ali fiuestiotis of importance have by their vote shown their prejudices against labor. Neither can I a gre e that having the interstate commerce eommis sion handle wages and working conditions woubì solve the prob lem, as these men are appointed to the commission by the President and are not practical railroad meli and are inftuenced by politics. In my opinon adjustment board equally divided between railroad nien and railroad management, as per adjustment board, Nos. 1, 2 and 3 under government contici of the railroad, these men to be picked by empioyes and the man agement, with a faw that ali de cision mu.-t be lived up to, would be a much better solution. The above, with the knowledge by the railroad management that decisions of this board wouid be fair and just as well as finul would cause the railroad man agement to settle with their own employes on a majority of the di.-putes without recour.-e to the board. This would bring better co-operution and would faclitate. the handling of dispute, which heretofore have taken up much time and caused delays that hav(! Ic-d to friction and dissenson and ultimately precipitateti nine-tenths of the strikes in industry. St. Johnsbury and Newport neo pie will al.-o be interested to hear what Payon Smith, Ma.achu sett commissioner of education ha to say about President' Hard ing' message. Dr. Smith has spoken before packed house both in St. Johnsbury anl in Newport. His remarks follow: The message in general gave me a very favorable impression. In particular, the straight-forward statement on prohibition was very much needed. The remarks on the immigration problem are impres sive and deal with the question in a common sense ay, On the ques tion of co-ordination of the rail road, and the propoed changes in the railroad labor board. I think President Harding is on the right track. As to child labor, recent experience indicate that his rec ommendation for constitutional amendment shows the only way to deal with it. The message is a fine state document, and puts before the country in good pioportion the outstanding ibuea to be met. Presi dent Harding muft have had in mind the Fettine forth of his views to the entire country rather than any hope that Congress would take immediate action on ali the question discussed. A school of instruction for offi cerà of the National Guard was held in the Sonate chaniber of the State House last week. The school opened Thursday evening in charge of Colonel John L.
