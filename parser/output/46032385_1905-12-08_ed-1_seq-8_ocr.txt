DECEMBER 8, M05 The Commoner. 7 THE PRESIDENT S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS President Roosevelt's message was delivered to Congress Tuesday, December 5. In the beginning the people are congratulat ed upon their "great prosperity" and are remind ed that in our industrial and social system the interests of all men are closely intertwined. Referring to corporations, the president says that there must be governmental restraint or biipervision, and that experience has shown that U is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision by state action. In his view this can only bo effectively exercised by tli3 national government. He says that he believes that con gress has the power to ena,t a law to give effective regulation, but if this proves impossil3 "it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the national gov ernment by a proper amendment of the consti tution." Referring directly to the railway rate ques tion, the president recommends that power be given to some administrative body, such as the interstate commerce commission to decide, upon a case being7 brought before it, whether a given railroad rate is reasonable and just. If such rate is. found to be unreasonable and unjust, then this administrative body is to have power "after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly called this decision to zo into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain thence onward, subject to review by the courts." On the subject of rebates ho says "it some times happens at present not that a rate is too high, but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such cases the commission would have the right to fix' this already established -minimum rate as . the maximum; and it wbuld need only one or two h decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giv ing improper minimum rates." It is also recommended that all private car lines and refrigerator charges and the like be put under the supervision of the interstate com merce commission or some other administrative body to whose care railroad rates are intrusted. The president lay3 considerable stress on the importance cf "the need of providing for ex peditious action by the interstate commerce com mission in all matters." His reference to railway rate, legislation and rebates are hereinafter re produced in full. Attention is again called to the necessity for legislation requiring the uze of block signals upon railroads, and congress is reminded that "the number of serious collisions upon un blocked roads that have occurred within the past year adds -force to the recommendation." Attention is called to "the excessive hours of labor to which railroad employes in train service are in many cases subjected," and the president says "if there are any :easons for lim iting by law the hours of labor in any employ ment, they certainly apply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose vigilance and alertness' in the performance of their duties the safety of all who travel by rail depends.' The recommendation contained in a former message concerning an employer's liability law for the District of Columbia and for the Navy Yards is reiterated, and the hope is expressed that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speedily as possible. He says that it is the duty of the national government to see that 'the city of Washington is "made a model city in all respects, both as regards parks, public play grounds, proper reg ulation of the system of housing, so as to do away with the evils of alley tenements, a proper sys tem of education, a proper system of dealing with truancy, juvenile offenders, and proper handling of the charitable work of the District." He fur ther recommends for the District of Columbia proper factory laws tow prevent all abuses in the employment of women and children, and says ttut while "these will be used chiefly as object lessons" even "this limited amount of usefulness would be of real value." While admitting that some judges ha" ) mis used the power of Injunctions, the president says that it would bo unwise to deprive courts of fi2cI iie injunctions in labor Ssputes hv 2 Ul n?dy to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give duo notice to the luZVZ m!"U0S before grant"'K the writ? the I of ir? b0, ?? ,mrtG if th0 averse party does ovhinin1 a! h, tirao and PUlce ordered." Ho explains that "due notice" must dorond upon the facts of the case, saying "It should not be used as a pretext to permit violation of law or the jeopardizing of life or property," and adds of course tliid would not authorize tho issuing of -a restraining injunction in any cases in which it is not already authorized by existing law." He renews the recommendation made in his last message for an Investigation by the depart ment of commerce and labor of general labor conditions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legisla tion in the several states. A similar recommend ation is made with respect to an inquiry into the conditions of women in industry. The president says that the employer and employe are not the only ones interested in any great labor disturbance, but that the Interests of a third party the general public must be considered, and he says "every considerable la bor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should be investigated by tho govern ment and the facts officially reported to the public." Referring to the recent disclosures before the insurance investigating committee, the pres ident says "it has been only too clearly shown that certain of the -men at the head of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishon esty; they draw the line only this" shU of what may be called law honesty, the kind of honesty necessary in order to avoid falliug into the clutches of the law." The president ays that while the only complete remedy for this condi tion must be found in an aroused public con science, that "much can be done by legislation which is not only drastic but practical." He rec ommends "adequate national supervision of com mercial interests which are clearly national in character." He says that "the congress has al ready recognized that interstate insurance may bo a proper subject for federal legislation, for in creating the bureau of corporations it authorized it to publish andv supply useful information con cerning interstate corporations 'Including corpor ations engaged in insurance.' " He says that insurance business has outgrown in magnitude the possibility of adequate state supervision, also "the congress should carefully consider whether legislation can be had," adding "this legislation should apply with equal forco to fraternal and benevolent organizations." Approaching tho tariff question tho president says: "There is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal perfection in the methods of raising revenue; and tho shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to .determine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. Much must depend not merely on the needs but on the desires of the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not necessar ily identical. Of course no change can be made on lines beneficial to, or desired by, cne section or one state only. There must be something like a general agreement among the citizens of the several states, as represented in congress, .that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole; and there ihould then bo a sincere, intelligent and disinterested effort to make it in such shape as will combine so far as possible the maximum of good to e people at large, with the minimum of necessary disregard for the special interests of localities or sections." The president says that of course the income must equal the expenditure, or else the revenues must ha increased, saying "unless our expenditure can be kept within tho revenue, then our revenue laws must be readjusted." He adds: "It is a3 yet too early to r.ttempt to outline what shape such a readustment should take, for it Is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should bo considered whether it is not de sirable that the tariff laws should provide for ap plying as against or in favor of any other nation the maximum and minimum tariff rates estab lished by the 'congress, so as to .secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Having in view oven larger con siderations of policy than those of a purely economic nature, it would, in my judgment, be well to endeavor to bring about cloHor commer cial connections with the other peoples of this continent. I am happy to bo able to announce to you that Russia now treats upon the most-favored-nation basis." Calling attention to tho neod of economy tho president recommends "a rigid scrutiny of ap propriations." Ho says that all unnecessary oillcos should bo abolished, and particularly rec ommends tho abolishment of what Is known aa the office of receiver of public moneys for United States land offices. Ho says this will effect a saving of about $250,000 a year. Ho nlco says that considerable money may be saved tho public printing oflk whore "thore Is a constant ly growing tendency to publish mnsHOH o, un important Information." Ho warns the congress against what he calls 'false economy," explain ing " a cutting down of tho navy, for Instance would bo a crime against the nation. To fall to push forward all work on the Pnuana canal would bo as groat a folly." On tho currency question tho president says that there should he "the element of elasticity 1o our currency system." While "inflation must be avoided," ho says "some provision shcjld be made that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In the loss active seasons of the year." I' wants a currency that will "contract against speculation and will expand for the needs of leKltlmate business." Emphasizing the necessity for "business methods In the departments," tho president sug gests that congress "provide for the transfer, distribution, coiisoliilatlon and assignment of duties and exccutlvo organization, and or tho changes In business methods within or between the several departments that will" best promote tho economy, efficiency and high character of (lie governmental work." Referring to federal elections tho president renews the recommendation made In the last an nual message concerning tho enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption In elec tions. On this point he says: "In political campaigns In a country us large and populous as ours it is inevitable that thore should bo much expense of an entirely legitimate kind. Tills, of course, means that jnnny contribu tions, and some of the of L.rgo size, must be made, and, as a matter of fact, In any big political contest such contributions arc always made to both sides. Tt is entirely propor both to give and receive them, unless thore Is an Im proper motive connected with either gift or re ception. If they are extorted by any kind of pres sure or promise, express or implied, direct or in direct, in tho way of favor or Immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes not only im proper but criminal. It will undoubtedly be diffi cult as a matter of practical detail to shape an act which shall guard with reasonable certainty against such misconduct; but if it is possible to secure by law the full and verified p blication in detail of all the sums contributed to nnd ex pended by the candidates or committees of any political parties the result can not but be whole some. All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in cor rupt practice acts. Not only should both the national and the several state legislatures forbid any officer of a corporation from using tho money of the corporation in or about any election, but they should also forbid such use of money In connection with any legislation save by the em ployment of counsel in public manner for dis tinctly legal services." Referring to his invitation to another con- , ferencp to be held at The Hague, the president " says that he assumes that all civilized govern ments will support the movement. He devotes a paragraph in bis message to reference to the general attitude of the United States government . toward peace. He- expresses the hope that this second Hague conference "may mark a long stride forward in the direction of securing tho peace of justice throughout the world." Reaffirming the Monroe doctrine, the presi dent says that.it must be made clear that that doctrine is not to be treated as an excuse for agtrrandizement on our part at tho expense of the renublies to the south, and wo must try to con vince all the nations of '" Is continent ' it "no . just and orderly government has anvthing to fear from' us." Ho save that somo nation by being unable "to keep order among its own people or m 4u'u .
