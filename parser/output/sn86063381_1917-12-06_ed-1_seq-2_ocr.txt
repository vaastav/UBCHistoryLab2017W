A few days ago Lieutenant Berg and others of the crew of a large in- terned German liner escaped from their place of internment, but luckily were recaptured, Berg and another officer being caught on the border and endeavoing to get into Mexico. Quite recently a story was published which stated that the United States government was paying large salaries to these German prisoners, enemies of the government, and the articles prompted an inquiry to the Committee on Public Information, Washington. The writer said he had heard the statements had said interned German captains were drawing 94,000 per year from ttffe United State*, whereas 4f tttCy W^ere serving on' their own ships they wo\ild receive bul? $2,300. The committee on Public Information replied as follows: "It is entirely true that the government is paying salaries to German officers In the detention camps in this country. In this connection I call your attention to the laws and customs of war on land, Article 17 of the Annex, adopted by the Hague convention, October 18, 1917: "Officers taken prisoner shall receive the same rate of pay as officers of corresponding rank In the country where they are detained, the amount to be ultimately refunded by their own government." You will perceive that in thiB matter we are merely bearing ourselves with the proud punctilio for which the President pleaded in his war mes- sage." Maybe this is all right but we believe the German government con- sidered its solemn treaties as "scraps of paper We think It might not be out of place for the United States to stretch a little and consider any agreement that would pay large salaries to enemy aliens, prisoners of the nation which sunk the Lusitania with the heavy loss of life of American women and children, a nation that has shelled life boats with women and children struggling for their lives, a "scrap of paper" also. We can't quite get the Idea of providing them with better comforts than they had at home and paying them a fat salary in addition. But, as we remarkedmaybe it is all right. However, we can't see it.
