Our leaders by this time have fairly made themselves familiar with the contents of Pres ident Grant's last annual message to Congress and we can therefore converse with them more familiarly and intelligently on some of the principal subjects treated. Our neighbor ■was at lirst forced into an involuntary admis sion that it w as a very good production, ex ceeding its expectations, but another day's stud) of the situation has opened its eyes widely—at least to the anti-Democratic doc trine of speaking w'ell of anything that ema nates from a Republican President. It pre tends to discover, after hard search, that the President's recommendations about home mat ters are absurd, while in the matter of for eign relations, although it seems all right, there is something kept back, or, vulgarly speaking, "a nigger in the wood pile," and it seems very confident that if it could tear the wood pile down a full-grown African would be found. Wishing it good luck in its search, we will ask our readers for a moment's atten tion and indulgence in expressing our judg ment of this document. We think the message is a sound, sensible, ^atesmau-like production, happily selecting those matters of most vital importance in our domestic concerns, and urging them upon the consideration of our people in sound speech and cogent reasoning ; while in for eign matters it adheres to the safe teachings of Washington's farewell address, seeking to cultivate friendly relations and avoiding en tangling alliances and complications w'ith all nations. We know that it has been charged and widely circulated—perhaps believed by many —that the President w T as desirous of recog nizing Cuban indépendance, and wresting that island from Spain by threats or force. No act or word gives countenance to the charge. No doubt the President's sympa lilies, as of most of our people, are with the native Cubans, but all must sec on reflection that it would tye a foolish and altogether un statesman-like action to follow our sympa thies into a struggle in which all monarchical nations would feel inclined and might think themselves compelled to take sides against us. The fate of the early French revolution ought to warn us against any such a course. There is no danger that any nation will be able to take Cuba and carry it off from where the Creator has set it. Nor is there any doubt that its destinies are linked with ours, as surely as it it is closely connected by natural position with our contiuent. The President has done what his duty required of him— compelled Spain to surrender its claim to try American citizens by court martial without opportunity of defense. So far as Mexico is concerned, i must have been rather cooling to those who have so re cently been circulating such sensational ru mors about a treaty already signed, transfer ring all the northern States of that country to the United States, to learn in such few words that the Joint Commission has not yet report ed. It will probably be time enough to levy execution after we have recovered judgment. We have no doubt that the Government of Mexico has faithfully tried to live up to treaty obligations and will continue to do so, and if forced to admit its inability, will offer to do the next best thing. But turning from foreign affairs—wherein, look which way we will, every one will con fess that American interests were never bet ter protected nor the rights of her citizens more carefully guarded and universally re spected—let us look at the recommendations on home subjects, and see if these views are so absurd as our Bourbon neighbor pretends. The President thinks education one of the matters so essentially necessary to the main tenance of free institutions, as well as gen eral advancement and prosperity, that he rec ommends that it should appear in the Consti tution, and be imperative on ail the States to provide for universal education. The United States in the Constitution (sec. 4, art. 4) guarantees to every State in the Un ion a Republican form of government. Wherein is it a whit more absurd to guaran tee to every citizen an education that shall in some measure fit him for the duties of citi zenship and unable him to maintain a Repub lican form of government ? It looks to us absurd for the General Government to under take to carry out the guarantee that it has as sumed , unless ii has the power to compel the States to educate their citizens. Ignorance may not be incompatible with tbe mainte* nance of other forms of government, but free institutions can only exist upon the broad and strong basis of general intelligence. It is only a wonder that this provision was not incorporated when the Constitution was framed. But, say some, this is a matter for the States to provide, and the General Gov ernment has no business to intermeddle. Not so, at all. Every citizen of a State is also a citizen of the Nation. The Nation cannot prosper unless the States also prosper. If States neglect their duty to their own citizens, the Nation is damaged thereby, and has just cause of complaint. Until slavery was abol ished it was impossible to procure such an amendment. Not until very recently has such a thing as a free school law been known in any one of the Southern States. It is now becoming generally conceded, even in that section, that there is an advan tage in educating all classes. We believe it is possible now to incorporate the amendment proposed into the Constitution, and we are very sure that nothing in the Constitution would better become it. There is nothing in that instrument but such powers as have been conceded by the States. Domestic slavery w*as pre-eminently a State institution. Per haps our neighbor don't like what the consti tution decla r es and provides on that subject. The advantage of having it in the National Constitution is to reach those States that fail of their duty in this regard and entail damage on the nation as well as on themselves. So far as taxing church property, it may not at present seem as practical a question for the attention of the General Government, as it would if the Democratic doctrine of free trade should ever prevail, and direct taxation accompany it. The exemption of church property certainly conflicts with our grand re quisite of all taxation—that it should be equal. Without saying more, we venture to assert that, whether a man belongs to any church or none, the more he devotes careful study to all the questions legitimately entering into the subject, the nearer will he come to coin ciding with the President in this portion of his message. Other portions of this message may receive attention hereafter. We hope our readers will not be content with a single reading of the document. A 

DEFEATED CANDIDATE. Benjamin G. Harris, of Maryland, was one ot the several unlucky candidates offer ing themselves to Democratic Congressmen for Sergeant-at-Arms of the House. Benja min was a Congressman in war times, and then established a reputatiou which he has not since lost of being a secession sclalawag and blatherskite of the first water. He want ed to be Sergeant-at-Arms. To bring this about he addressed a circular letter to the eighty Southern Brigadiers, laying before them his Congressional record, and asking the bestowal of their votes to make him the nominee of the pure and undetiled chivalry. He wouldn't demean himself by the solicita tion of Northern Democratic votes. All he required was the agreement of the Southern Brigadier Congressmen to unite upon him, and he would take his chances of whipping enough Northern Democratic members into his support to give him the coveted office. But Harris was too late with his circular. As much as the Brigadiers might have felt in clined to favor his aspirations, they had al ready giyen pledges that left the blantaut Maryland rebel out in the cold. This was a sad blow to Harris, as any one would say, after reading his circular, of which the fol lowing is a specimen extract : "When in Congress I felt it my duty to vote against every bill for the raising of forces, and every bill for the appropriation of money w carry on the war, and had the glory of receiving the censure of the Radicals of the House for uttering in a speech the fol lowing prayer: 'God Almighty grant you may never subjugate the South.' My great est regret is that God did not grant my prayer." * The Democrats left to mourn over the blasted hopes of Harris are probably few in number. Kentucky and Texas were given the Clerk and Door-k :eper, and the Sergeant at-Arms was considerately conferred upon Thompson, Gov. Allen's Committee Lieuten ent, who ran the late soft money campaign in Ohio. When next we hear from Harris, let it be for some office less paltry than that he has recently and so unsuccessfully sought. The Democracy is looking for some one to run for the Presidency. Let Harris announce himself a candidate. He might not, proba bly would not, get the nomination, but he has a right to try. Let the Maryland blather skite keep himself at the front. THE PUBLIC DEBT. Exhibit to the Close of November. The public debt statement is as follows : Matured debt $22,430,870; legal tenders, $372,541,479; certificates of deposit, $42, 610,000; fractional currency, $42,350,105 ; coin certificates; $19,796,500; total without interest, $477,304,084; total debt, $2,207, 986,254; total interest, $34,960,516 ; cash in the Treasury, coin, $70,404,676; cash in treasury, currency, $12,014,962 ; decrease of debt during November, $480,078 ; decrease since June 30th, 1875, $10,771,593; bonds issued to Pacific Railroad companies, interest payable in lawful money, principal outstand ing, $64,623,512; interest accrued and not yet paid, $1,615,587 ; interest paid by the United States, $28,202,807; interest repaid by trans portation of mails, etc., $6,575,854; balance of interest paid by the United States, $21, 620,953. __ English capitalists have been badly scorch ed lending money to poor governments. Turkey owes England's money lenders $500, 000,000, Egypt half as much more, and the various South American States have sold the same parties an immense amount of bonds in times past, on which the interest has rarely been paid. United States bonds, however, rank well in the money market. TELEGRAMS REPORTED SPECIALLY FOR THE HERALD BY WE8TERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY. CONGRESS. SENATE. Washington, December 7.—At 12:15, on motion of Frelinghuysen, the Senate took a recess until 1 o'clock. Upon reassembling, Anthony, from the Joint Committee to wait upon the President and inform him of the organization of the two houses of Congress, reported that the President said be would communicate with Congress immediately in writing. At 1:15 Mr. Luckey, Private Secretary to the President, appeared at the bar of the Senate with the message and it was read by Gorham, Secretary of the Senate. The reading was concluded at 2:10, and w as listened to with marked attention by the Senators and a large audience in tho galleries. Sir Edward Thorn ton, British Minister, was in the diplomatic gallery and appeared deeply interested. On motion of Conkling, the message was ordered to lay upon the table and be printed. He also offered the usual resolution to print extra copies. Referred to the Committee on Printing. The President yro tern., laid before the Sen ate the reports ot the various Cabinet officers, aud the Comptroller of the Currency, which were ordered to be printed aud to lay on the table. Adjourned. 

HOUSE. On motion of Randall the House took a re cess until 1 o'clock, the hour fixed for draw ing of seats. At that hour the recess was ex tended to give the members absent on the committee to wait upon the President—Cox, Knott and Blaine—an opportunity to be pres ent and select their seats when their names should be called. The courtesy of allowing the oldest continuous member to select his seat in advance of the drawing was extended to Kelly, and a member was also permitted to select a seat 1er Stephens of lieorgia. At 1:45 Cox reported that the committee had waited upon the President, and that a communication in writing would be sent to the House forthwith. * The Speaker submitted the question whether the House w T ould now draw their seats or have the President's message read. The former course was adopted, and a blindfolded page then drew the names of the members from a box one by one, and the member drawn came trom outside the bar, where all were congregated, and occupied the seat which he purposed holding for the Con gress. As soon as order was restored, the Presi dent message was received and presented to the House and read by the reading clerk,Mr. Mehaney. The reading occupied two hours and five minutes. At first the message was listened to with interest aud attention, but after passing the portions relating io educa tion, church property and Cuba, the attention began to flag and the members gradually re tired, so that during the reading of the latter half of the message there were probably not forty members in their seats, and but few of those paying the slighest attention. The mes sage was ordered printed. Cox presented the petition of \V. II. Pres cott and others of South Carolina, with refer ence to the seat of the representative of the Third Congressional District of South Caro lina, and moved it be referred to the Com mittee on Elections. Carried. The House then adjourned until Friday.

Ingalls introduced a bill for the sale of the Blackbob Indian lands in Kansas, and con ferring exclusive jurisdiction over the Indian reservations by the United States Courts, and for the punishment of crimes committed by and against the Indians. Ingalls submitted a resolution that the Sec retary of the Interior be requested to trans mit the report of the commission appointed to investigate the affairs of the Osage Indian Agency, with the evidence taken by the Board and the separate findings of the indi vidual members. Agreed to. The bill introduced by Senator Morton in regard to counting the votes for President aud Vice-President, is a eopyj of the bill in troduced last February. 

SENATE. Washington, December 9. —Senator Bay aid said on behalf of the minority in the Seqate he desired to express regret that upon the Committee of Finance, numbering nine, they had not been allowed the same proportion which a sense of justice on ihe part of the majority had given the minority. On other committees at this time, consider ing the importance of the duties of that com mittee, the number of the minority on the floor and their share of the responsibility in moulding legislation in regard to finances, the ratio deemed by the majority and minority as|a just one, should prevail as upon the other committees. He had understood, how ever, that two memebers of the Finance Coni miitee—the Senator from Illinois (Logan) and the Senator from Nevada (Jones)—would be here soon, and upon their arrival it was proposed to consider the subject of allowing the minority greater representation, and he hoped the proposition w ould be carried out. It was ordered that bills and all memorials pre sented yesterday be taken from the table and referred to appropriate committees. Ingalls presented a petition of the widow r of A. F. Short, late Deputy U. S. Surveyor, asking an appropriation of $10,000 compen sation for the loss of her husband who was killed by Indians while he was surveying lands in Kansas. Referred to Committee on Indian Affairs. Maxey presented a memorial of the Texas Constitutional Convention in relation to dep redations on the people of the Texas frontier by bands of marahders organized beyond the limits of the State. Referred to Committee on Military Affairs. Cooper presented a memorial of the book agents of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, asking to be compensated for the loss of property at Richmond, Virginia, and at Louisville, Kentucky, during the war. Re ferred to Committee on War Claims. It was ordered that w hen the Senate ad journs to-day it be to meet on Monday next. West presented a letter from W. L. Mc MilleD, of Louisiana, asking permission to withdraw his credentials as Senator elect from the State of Louisiana by the McEnery Legislature. He submitted an order that the request for withdrawal of the three papers be granted, but objection was made by sev eral Senators on the Democratic side, and it was laid over. Sherman introduced a bill to extend the duration of the court for the adjudication of the claims arising under the Geneva award. Referred to the Judiciary Committee. It provides for amending the act of June 23d, 1874, so as to make it include all the claims directly resulting from damage caused by the so called insurgent cruiser Shenandoah, be fore her departure from Melbourne, Feb. 18, 1863; and by the Chicamauga, Georgia, Nash ville, Retribution, Sumpter and Tallahassee, respectively that may be presented to the Court of Commissioners of Alabama claims, within six months after the passage of this amendatory act. The bill proceeds to declare that all such claims shall be re ceived and adjudicated, and paid to the same extent and effect, and in the same manner, and out ot the same fund that is provided in the act of June 23d 1874, for the claims re sulting trom damage caused by acts of the Alabama, Florida, and Shenandoah after her departure from Melbourne. The second sec tion provides that the Commissioners shall, as soon as possible, report to the Secretary of the Treasury each of the several judgments which have been, or may be hereafter, ren dered by them for loss or damage caused by the Alabama and Florida, and their tenders, and by the Shenandoah after her departure from Melbourne, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall, as soon as may be, after either of the said judgments are reported, pay the same with interest thereon, at the rate of 4 per cent per annum from the date of loss as certified. The bill finally provides that the duration and powers of the said court shall be extended to the 22d day of January, 1877, and it also authorizes the President, by proclamation, to further extend the time and pow'ers for a period not exceeding one year thereatter. Ingalls introduced a bill to amend the act of June 2d, 1864, to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missonri river to the Pacific ocean. It pro vides that a failure or omission of either of the Pacific railroad companies to pay the cost of surveying lands to which they are entitled under Congressional grants or take patents for them, shall not exempt such lands from local taxation, but they shall be subject to taxation by States and Terri tories, upon the evidence of lists which it is hereby made the duty of the Commissioner of the General Land Office to prepare and furnish to the Government of any State or Territory which may apply for the same, showing what lands pertain to the respective railroad grants in their respective State and Territorial limits. Bogy introduced a bill authorizing the pay ment of duties on imports in legal tenders and national bank notes. It provides that from and after July 4th, 1876, duties on im ports may be paid in legal tenders, national bank notes or coin, at the option of the im porter. Bogy said it was not his intention to discuss the merits of the bill, but he looked upon it as a measure tending to specie resum tion, and in his opinion it was the only way the country would ever attain a resumption. He offered the bill so as to prepare the way for this operation. The only way to resume specie payment was by appreciating the pa per now in circulation. He wa* not in favor of any increase of paper currency, but wish ed to appreciate that paper as long as the country had a system of National banks, whether it was a wise one or not. It seemed to him that it was the duty of Congress to give that paper as much value as possible. He desired the amount of legal tenders now in circulation to remain as at present. He look ed upon any contraction of currency as ruin ous to the country throughout. The bill sub mitted by him could be explained as the only measure which could possibly lead to a re sumption, aud at the proper time he would endeavor to explain it. Morrill (Vt.) said he would not discuss this measure now, but after the statement of the Senator from Missouri (Bogy) he (Morrill) deemed it proper to make a counter statement. It was perfectly clear that the measure which the Senator proposed would be one of con traction. It would at once drive out of the country what little specie we now have. When there was no use for specie it became a com modity and would be exported. The passage of this bill would be a violation of public faith, and he was very sorry to see that this was the first proposition in regard to the finances brought into the Chamber. Should the bill be passed it w T ould reduce our revenue at least 25 per cent. The very salvation of the country depended upon a strict adherence to the pledges of the Government. Referred to the Committee on Finance. Thornton submitted a resolution to amend the 25th rule of the Senate, so that bills may be introduced without previous notice and that it should not be necessary to state in the minutes that permission has been asked or obtained to introduce a bill without such notice. Morton said it cost several hundred dollars every session to print these foimal words in records, and he saw no use in it. Referred. After the executive session the Senate ad journed until Monday. 

HOUSE. Washington, December 10. —After the reading of the journal the oath was adminis tered to the chaplain and to Egbert, who was absent on Monday. On motion of Gibson, a resolution was adopted adding to the committees of the House a committee of eleven to be known as the Committee on the Mississippi Levees. Hopkins offered a resolution, that so much of the message of the President as relates to the Centennial be referred to a select com mittee of thirteen. A point of order having been made that the message bad already been referred to the Committee of the Whole, and was not in pos session of the House, the resolution was, by unanimous consent, finally adopted. Holman moved an adjournment, but yield ed to MacDougall, who asked leave to intro duce and put upon its passage a bill repealing so much cf the act of the 3d of March, 1875, as has been construed to cover the postage on printed matter. Starkweather said lie had a bill, prepared by the Post Office Department, which he de sired to offer as a substitute. It provides that from the first of January, 1876, postage shall • be charged on pamphlets, transient newspa pers, periodicals, magazines, handbills, post ers, unsealed circulars, prospectuses, proof sheets, and corrected proof sheets, at the rate of one cent for every two ounces or fraction thereof, and that postage on all other mail able matter of the third class shall remain as now provided by law 7 . Holman said that no doubt the measure was exactly correct, but it was a very import ant measure, and it should receive due con sideration. MacDougall said he would accept Stark weather's bill as a substitute for his own. Ilolman thought the bill was too broad in its provisions, and proper time should la taken for its consideration. Starkweather said that this bill bad been prepared at the Post Office Department, and ought to be considered immediately. Cox—You committed a blunder last ses'i" 11 about this matter; do not hurry us now. Starkweather—I did not blunder. Cox—-Your side of the House did, aud we
