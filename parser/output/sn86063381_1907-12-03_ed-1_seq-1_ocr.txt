Chilson gave the alarm of fire, but the building was so nearly destroyed that it was useless to attempt to stay the flames, and the roundhouse was soon but a mass of ruins.

The origin of the fire is unknown, but there are some who suspect incendiarism. It is impossible at present to estimate the amount of the damage. the Circle has ever had since its organization.

DOUGLAS LUMBER CO. TO PUT MILL UP NORTH Will Erect a Shingle-Making Plant on Bullhead Lake North of Kelliher. Kelliher Journal: The Douglas Lumber company of Bemidji will soon commence the erection of a mill on Bullhead lake for the manufacture of cedar shingles, if arrangements now pending materialize. If it is established the new industry will mean much to Kelliher, not only that it will employ a large number of men, but will create a market for dead and down and culled cedar poles and posts. For some time the company has been securing options on large tracts of cedar in this vicinity, buying directly from homesteaders and lumbering companies that do not deal in cedar products, and have also been getting options from cedar dealers in Kelliher and vicinity for their culled poles and posts, and to date have secured sufficient timber to insure the establishment of "the new industry in Kelliher^ v!? An enormous amount of this class of cedar suitable for the manufacture of excellent cedar shingles goes to waste yearly. Much of this timber could be utilized by such mills as it is proposed to locate here. The Douglas Lumber company own and operate similar mills at Be midji and Tenstrike and in both places are decided successes. Arrangements aie being made with the Crookston Lumber com pany for the purchase of a site on Bullhead lake where the mill will be established. The President's Message.
