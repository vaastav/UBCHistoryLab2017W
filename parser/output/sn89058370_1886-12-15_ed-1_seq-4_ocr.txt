It is a piatter of surprise to many people that the farming land in Tennessee has been declining in valuation every year, for twenty years.. In last week's Timks we gave the valuation of the farming lauds of Tennessee to be $141,000, 000, which shows a decrease in val uation, in twenty years, of $40,000, 000 two millions a year. This is a wonderful state of things and a damaging statement to make. There has been an eifort on the part of the public press to boom the South, showing the advanced interest in manufactures, mining and growth of towns and cities; how the South is about to compete with the North and East, and yet, with all these glowing statements and tine pictures, our farming lands are decreasing in values. There must be a cause for it, and it will be a bright day for Tennessee when that cause is ascertained and the remedy found. Negatively, it can be said, it is not because the land is more barren than it was in 1866; and further, it is not because the farmers are relaxing their efforts to make good crops, or to bring their land up to as high a standard as they did in that year, or in any year since. If, then, with these negative propositions satisfactorily answered, wherein shall be found the real cause and the remedy? This will be no easy matter to do, as the prices of the productions of the soil, have been good; and to the outside and inside world that ought to determine the real value of the soil. The price of wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, potatoes, Ac, were largely in excess of what they were before the war. Then, cer tainly, that cannot be the reason of this decline in values of farming lands. It may be said that the great body cf agricultural lands in the West has something to do in the regulation of prices; that, how ever, can be answered by saying, these lands were subject to entry before 188G. It might be well to ask, whether the abolition of the sliivi p had anything to do with this decrease in value of farming lands. In answering this it may be well to ask some questions. 1st Is the demand, for the productions of the soil let! ? 2nd Is the supply less, and the cost of production more ? The answering of these would give some light. We leave the answer ing of these questions to such as may believe that the abolition of slavery has had something to do in this decrease of values. In some other issue of the Timks we will continue this discussion. IS A 

DEMOCRAT. Our country Democrats will doubtless he pleased to learn that the editor of the Knoxville Tribune has been converted. Conversion means transforming or changing. It occurred in this manner: He was traveling from Knoxville down to Civil Service Reform, breath ing threats and slaughter against Cleveland, when lo! a great light appeared to him which was in the nature of a message, and said: The foolish ones do not understand the ground upon which Civil 8erviee rests; and then a voice was heard saying, read my letter to Stone, as he a the subject of Civil Service Reform, he made speeches against my administration, he is an offens ive partisan; and at once the edit or of the Tribune arose and went to this place of reform and the brethren ministered unto him, and immediately he preached Cleve land, saying, "He is a better Demo crat than he was last year." The Timks oftlce is under obliga tions for a printed list of the House and Senate of the State of Tennes see, furnished by Mr. P. P. Pickard, candidate for Comptroller of the State. The Democrats, by his elasi ficatkm, were -1 Senators and the Republicans 12; while in the House the lomocrats 61, Republicans 37, Ind. Democrat 1. We pity the one, he will a hard time, as mugwumps in the Tennessee Legislature will not have much influence, especially if the American prevails, which, of course, it will. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Cleveland delivered his annual message to Congress on the 6th inst. In view of the result of the recent elections we waited pa tiently for that document. Portions of it we have read two or three times to get at his views as he de sires us to understand them; but on some points we have been una ble to get his true position, especial ly in his discussion of Federal tax ation. In his discussion he says: "Those who toll for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital, though sometimes vaunt ing its importance aim clamoring for the protection and favor of the government, is dull and sluggish, till touched by the magical hand of labor it springs into activity, fur nishing an occasion for federal tax ation, and gaining the value which enables it to bear its burden, and the laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring whether in those circum stances and considering the tribute he constantly pays into the public treasury, as he supplies hi? daily wants, he receives his fair share of advantages," This point made by the President is to the effect that the laboring men are swindled or defrauded by the policy of the Government, and he is just now getting his eyes open to the fraud. After this showing he takes up a different branch of the subject to convince men of money that the tariff is iniquitous in another direction and to another class of persons, therefore he says: "The present condition of affairs constrains our people to demand that by a revision of our revenue laws the receipts of the government shall be reduced to the necessary expense of its economical adminis tration, and this demand should be recognized and obeyed hythe peo ple's representatives in the legisla tive branch of the government." This position, as it stands, is clear and easily understood, which, when stripped of verbiage, it would read: adopt free trade and buy foreign goods, where you can get them cheaper than in America. This idea is more fully expressed by him in a talk to farmers who like to sell at the highest prices and buy for the least. To that branch of in dustry he says: "Our farmers, too, and those en gaged directly and indirectly in supplying the products of agricul ture, so that day by day, and as of ten as the daily wants of their households recur they are forced to pay excessive and needless taxation, while their products struggle in for eign markets with the competition of nations which, by allowing a freer exchange of productions than we permit enable their people to sell for prices which distress the Amer ican frmer." This is a clear statement of the doctrine of free trade. Even the Courier-Journal, Mr. Morrison or Speaker Carlisle could not object to any of these questions, as they are entirely orthodox, being a case of special pleading for free trade, and no man after reading these marked expressions could charge him with being Janus-faced. Yet he remembered that his party is not a unit, besides he understands the great interests of the manufac turing and mining world, and what a factor they are iu politics, so he feels that if the glare and glitter of free trade by buying goods where you can get them the cheapest will not charm them, therefore it becomes necessary to discuss its re vision in a way that will suit them and in so adroit a way that it will require a learned man to separate the chaff from the wheat. Mr. Cleveland knows that a revis ion of the tariff will affect the amount of labor and the price of the same, therefore he says: "This relation of the working men to the revenne laws of the country and the manner in which it palpably influence the question of wages, should not be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper maintenance of the supply and protection of well paid labor and these considerations sug gest such an arrangement of the government revenues as shall re duce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the compensa tion of American labor and injuri ously affect its condition and the dignified place it bears in the esti mation of our people." This is a clear statement and con fession that the tariff he has just denounced as a fraud upon labor ing men does protect them In the amount of labor and the price of the same, and warns Congressmen against such a revision as will se riously affect them in the destruc tion of our manufacturing interests, which engages millions of hands, as also determines the price paid for labor; and, therefore, to make it clear to this class of industry, that it may rest easy and lend him some assistance, he says: "In readjustinig the burden of federal taxation a sound public pol icy requires that such of our citizens as have built up large and impor tant industries under present con ditions should not be suddenly and to their injury, deprived of the ad vantages to which they have adapt ed their business." The President says a sound pub lic policy requires that nothing should be done that would deprive the immense corporations of the advantage the tariff gave them. Here now the tariff, in its opera tions, is regarded as a blessing to these corporations and the men they employ, and any action that would deprive them of its benefits would not be good for the public. Now, then, let's get the Presi dent's statement of his views on the tariff in a few words, to wit: Protection is a Fraud. 1st To laboring men. 2nd To tax-payers. 3rd To farmers. This is his free trade idea. 

8KCOND. Protection is a blessing. 1st To laboring men, in providing labor and advanced pay. 2nd It builds up manufacturing and mining in terests, by protecting them against foreign corporations by giving them larger sales and less competition. This is his American idea. THE DIFFERENCE. Mr. Perkins and Mr. Delton met, and after the usual salutations, the conversation drifted out on the habits of life, the conduct of fami lies, the difference in children and what makes it. Mr. Perkins said to his friend, "There are some things I would like to know; how it is that your boys are ditferent from other boys. You have the best boys I ever saw ; they are peaceful among themselves, and are so with their associates. They have no bad hab its, and are seemingly proof against them. How have you managed them?" "Well," said Delton, "I took the Bible for my guide in this matter; you know it says, 'train up a child in the way it should go and when it is old it will not de part from it.' Now, I teach my children the Bible, in my own con duct and conversation, for it is my experience that children take their parents as their guide, when very young, as they have all confidence in father and mother, therefore everything they do they believe to be right. It is true that children oftim go in excess of their parents in wickedness, because when a vehicle is started down hill its fast ness of motion depends on the character of the inclination of the road, the hinderances on the way. When the parents have started down hill, there is no great reason why they outstrip them in the race, as the world, the flesh and the devil assist them, without the hinder ancces that the parents have for fast travel. For instance, if the father is guilty of falsehood, of drinking, of chewimg, smoking, profanity, deception and dishon esty, there will be an easy grade down lor the boy. In their case there is seemingly but one saving power for him, and that is, his mother is climbing up Zion's Hill she may be able to save him, by her godly example and her person al efforts in his behalf. But when father and mother are both teach ing the children by wrong examples it is a miracle alone of the divine Savior that arrests and saves the children. COT THE PIE. The Memphis Avalanche is now for Bate for U. S. Senator. The Times does not know whether this had anything to do with Doak's appointment or not. Politicians who have official bees in their hats will do most anything to get the honey the bees make. We wonder if the Union and the Banner could hear the buzzing of the little busy bee in their hats would pull them off for the honey. Is it possible that all the strong things said by these papers for education and the tariff can be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at one of Senator Harris' bows and exclama-ti-ms, "If you please, gentlemen, it is all right." BOTH ARE DEMOCRATS. Bob Taylor, when stumping the State for Governor, said, upon his honor, that there was not a dollar of surplus money in the treasury of the United States. President Cleveland, in his message to Con gress said on the 6th inst there was left in the Treasury at the close of the last fiscal year the sum of 93,!l5o,588.56. Who tells the truth and who misrepresents the facts? Both are Democrats, W. O. B07D,
