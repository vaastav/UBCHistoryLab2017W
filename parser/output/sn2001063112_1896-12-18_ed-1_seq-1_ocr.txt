SPANIARDS DENY IT STORY THAT MACEO WAS ASSAS-J SINATED DECLARED UNTRUE. Cubans, However, Insist He Was Led Into a Trap and Murdered—More Fight­ ing Said to Have Occurred Just Outside the Capital. KEY WERT, Fla., Dec. 14.—Advices from Havana state that La Lucha and other Spanish papers are quite bitter over the story sent out regarding Maceo's death, and deny it emphati cally. Palace officials also deny it, and it is stated that General Weyler will deny it over his own signature. More fighting is reported in the sub curbs and the insurgent forces are re ported as numbering several thousand. The work of entrenching is beingi pushed to the utmost and many pieces of new artillery have been mounted. Two thousand troops arrived from Spain during the day and they were en thusiastically received as they marched through the streets. They were all undersized and appeared like boys. The anti-American feeling is grow ing and several of the American corre spondents have been wnr:c..u .o be more careful in their difc- .iu. us on pain of being deported. TREACHEROUS SPANIARDS. A Story of Maeo*s Killing: Not Crod'table to the Kncniy. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 14.—A let ter has leen received by C. M. de Huan, head of the Cuban junta in this city, giving a detailed account of the assassination of General Maceo and his entire staff, with the exception of Dr. Zertnclm, who was Maceo's physician. The letter came from a reliable source in Havana, but the correspondent's name was not made public. The Marquis of Ahumudu sent a let ter to General Maceo inviting him to a conference. Maceo, who was the soul of honor, never for a moment thought that treachery was intended, especially as the invitation came from such a prominent Spaniard as the Marquis of Ahumada. He immediately returned an answer, saying that he would be glad to meet the Spanish general. Accompanied by his staff, lie went to the rendezvous, little dreaming of the awful fate that was in store for him. Found Himself in a Trap. On arriving at the trocha the Spanish soldiers, acting under orders, actually saluted the rebel chieftain as he passed, but when he reached the rendezvous Maceo was surprised to see, instead of the Marquis of Ahumada, a large body of Spanish soldiers, who seemed to come from every side. The actions of the troops were so sus picious that Maceo fe'.t that he had been cruelly trapped, and his suspicions were confirmed when a preniptory or-. tier came from a mounted officer, whose name it was subsequently learned was Major Cirujeda, who dashed up to the gallant Cuban leader as he stood at bay surrounded by his staff and demanded an unconditional surrender. "Never was the reply. Hardly had the words been uttered •when volley after volley was poured into the little baud of patriots, who, although liemmad in on all sides and outnumbered almost 100 to 1, stuck spurs to their horses, and with cries of "Cuba libre rode gallantly to their death. Maceo Slum at the First Fire. Maceo is reported to have fallen at the first fire with a bullet through his head, breaking his jaw. Another bul let hit him in the abdomen. Both shots were fatal. Young Francisco Gomez, son of the Cuban commander-in-chief, was the next to fall, and in a few moments bloody corpses, all shot almost beyond recognition, so fierce and concentrated was the Spanish fire, were all that re mained of the gallant Cubans who had trusted to Spanish honor. Only one member of the staff escaped, and that was Dr. Zertucha. The corpses were buried on the field, and every precaution was taken to keep the details of the horrible butchery from being made public. It is the opinion of many that this dreadful assassination of Maceo will do more to force prompt action on the part of the United States in regard to Cuba than anything else that could have happened. OFFER AID AND SYMPATHY. Many Callers at the Cub in He-dquarters at Washington. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—The head quarters of the Cuban legation in this city was the center of interest to a number of callers during the day who had had come to express to Senor Que sada their sorrow at the death of Gen oral Maceo and to offer their sympathy and, in some cases, help for the Cuban cause. These callers included a num ber of congressmen and two senators (whose names the Cuban representative declined to give) who told him of their desire to see some action taken by con gress that would be of assistance to the insurgents. Senor Quesada says that he has received during the past few days about 50 letters, many of which come from persons and organizations Offering to Send Men to assist the Cubans in fighting for lib erty. Responsive to these letters. Mr. MITCHELL, SOUTH DAKOTA. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1896.-SIX PAGES Quesada authorizes his former state ment that the Cubans have enough men and leaders to gain the cause for which they are fighting. They can avail themselves of 60,000 men, and more if necessary, but what they need is arms and ammunition and medicine for the sick and wounded. There was no information received at the head quarters other than a telegram from President Estrnd# Palma of the Cuban junta, which attributed Maceo's death to assassination by a plot arranged be tween Ahumada and Dr. Zertucha.

MADRID, Dec. 14.—According to some of the Spanish newspapers the question will be raised at the next cabinet coun cil of the expediency of a confidential note to the ambassadors of the powers here in Madrid in regard to President Cleveland's message.

SHAMOKIN, Pa., Dec. 14.—Congress man M. H. Kulp of the Seventeenth congressional district has left for Wash ington to be present in anticipation of action should the report of General An tonio Maceo's murder by the Spanish be confirmed. He was shocked upon learning of the alleged crime, and if the story of the assassination proves true, he says he will unhesitatingly vote for the suppression of further hos tilities. Heretofore he has been very conservative. Cirujeda Kewarded. NEW 

YORK, Dec. 14.—A special to The World from Havana says Major Cirujeda has been promoted to be a lieutenant colonel. HUNDREDS DROWNED. Wreck of the Steamer Sailer Oil' the Coast of Spain. LONDON, Dec. 11.—A special dispatch from Berlin, says that the North Ger man Lloyd steamer Salier, was wrecked on the night of Dec. 7, four miles north of Villagarcia, Spain, and 2}% miles from land. The dispatch further says that she must have broken up almost immediatety, as parts of the steamer have already washed ashore. She had on board over 300 passengers, mostly steerage, and a crew of 05 men. All on board were drowned. Of the steerage passengers, there were over 10' Russians, about 25 Gali cians, some Germans and about 200 Spaniards, according to the estimates, all on their way to the Argentine Re public, looking for new homes for them selves and families. If the disaster had occurred after the Salier touched at Villagarcia, the loss of life would have been much greater, as it is understood there were nearly 100 more passengers, men, women and children, awaiting at that port to embark on board the Salier for Buenos Avres. The Corrobodo rocks, on which it is believed the Salier was lost, are situ ated off the southwest coast of Cor unna, and should have been given a wide berth before the steamer headed eastward aiid then in a northeasterly direction for the bay leading up to Villagerisa. THE STORY IS DENIED. Turkish Minister Has Not Protested Against the Message. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—An emphatic and positive denial is made at the state department of the published report that Mustapha Bey, the Turkish minister, by direction of the sultan has entered a protest against the language of the president's message to congress, iu its treatment of the Turkish question. The report is characterized as "pure fic tion," and it is pointed out that Mus tapha Bey did not make a call on Sec retary Olney OD the day on which he is alleged to have signified to the secre tary of state the deep displeasure of the sultan.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—The negotia tions between the United States and Great Britain for a treaty of general arbitration, covering all subjects of dif ference between the two English speaking nations, present and pros pective, has advanced to a stage of completeness far beyond what the pub lic has had reason to believe. The purpose of Secretary Olney and Sir Julian Pauncefote is to conclude nego tiations within the next three weeks. All of the substantial features of the treaty have been agreed on. From the present status of the negotiations, it is believed the following will be the im portant terms of the treaty Features of the Treaty. First—A term of five years from the date of the exchange of ratification within which the treaty shall be oper ative. Second—A court of arbitration of six members, three to be drawn from the judiciary of the United States and three from the judiciary of Great Britain. Third—The submission to this tri bunal of all differences between the two nations, or to arise within the period of five years, this not to in clude the Bering sea question or the Venezuela question, now before inde pendent commissions, but to include the question of. the boundary between ^Alaska and British North America. Document of Importance. The completion of this treaty will mark an important epoch in the rela tions between the two English-speaking nations, and in the judgment of those who have been most identified with its consummation it will be the most im portant document of a peaceful' char acter in the history of their mutual dealings. The president made passing allusion to the subject in his recent message. It has been understood, how ever, that the main purpose of Mr. Olney was to reach an agreement as to Venezuela, and that, having accom plished this, the larger question of Arbitrating All Differences would require considerable time for its complete development. But the nego tiations have proceeded with surpris ing unanimity so that those engaged in the work confidently believe that it will be fully agreed upon and the sig natures of the contracting parties placed to the documents within three weeks. This will give fully two months for the consideration and rati fication of the treaty at the present session of the United States senate, and unless some unexpected obstacle should arise in that quarter, there is every reason to anticipate that the treaty May He Made Effective before the close of the present adminis tration. At least this is the confident hope and expectation of those most con cerned in the negotiations. Aside from the previously referred to points, it can be stated in a general way that the terms of the treaty are such as to "clear the board" of all the vexatious questions which have arisen between the United States aud Great Britain. These have been numerous in recent years, and some of them have threatened serious consequences. Advautug-es of the Treaty. The main purpose of the treaty is to guard against future differences threatening a rupture and in this the negotiators believe that the terms of the instrument will be such as to avoid all possibility of international conflict for the future. This is regarded as the maiu achievement. It is one said to be peculiarly advantageous to the com mercial interests of both countries, as suring them against rumors of war or the serious prospect of war. The reasons for limiting the treaty to five years are doubtless to place a measure of this extent on fair trial. Centeuar ati'K Terrible ^nte.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 14 The district court is in session at Ju neau, Alaska, and Judge Delaney de livered a sensational charge to the grand jury, in which he quoted from a published parody on the distribution of justice iu the territory of Alaska. It is generally charged in this report, on the authority of prominent citizens, that it is practically impossible to secure con victions in Alaska for violations of the liquor and fisheries laws, because the liquor men and canneries so combine that it is impossible to secure a jury that will convict. The judge charged the grand jury to either indict the men who are thus openly charged with de fiance of the law, or else those who are responsible for the publication referred to, for libel and slander. A CENTURY THE LIMIT. Report of a Mineralogist on the English Coal Supply.

He says that the supply will not stand a yearly increase of 3% per cent in the output, and that signs of decline probably will become apparent within a lifetime. Professor Kevin's estimate wiis that a century of the present rate of progress would exhausfr English mines to a depth of 4.000 feet, which is 1,500 feet deeper than the deepest mine.
