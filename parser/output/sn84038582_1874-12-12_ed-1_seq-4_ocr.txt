GRANT'S MESSAGE. As a succinct uud intelligent resume of the governmental affairs of this nation, our mid ers will find the message of President Crant, given on the second and third pages of to-day's Fkke Tkadkh, worthy of perusal. Aside from a sort of general interest that must al ways attach to such a document, however, tho message will awaken no. special attention ij.in bills. In reference to all other questions alio u 1 which the public are more oriels agitated, the President is either dumb or strangely weak, or noncommittal. He treats the Lou isiana case with an air of injured innocence that reminds one of Maebcth's exclamation, "Thou canst not say that I did it." He was willing mough. dear knows to have Kellogg ousted in Louisiana, and the government placed in the hands of the honest majority, but congress would do nothing ubuu it, and what else .".' he do? and m on. The Ar-Kan-as trouble is handled in the same gin gerly way, and the subject of cheap transput1 tat ion, aside from a squint in favor of the corrupt subsidy system, is relegated to the cheap transportation committee and congress.

Congress assembled at 12 o'clock on Mon day, 11 quorum being promptly on hand at the hour in both bouses. Alter the usual for mal committees to inform the president, etc., had been appointed and had performed their ceremonial function, the president's message was received and read in both houses. Before the message was received, however, Mr. Phelps, in the house, presented a bill to repeal the famous Poland gag law of the last session, and wanted it passed immediately, but the house, not wishing to depart from Its usual respect for the president, let the bill go over. Butler alone grunted out an objection to it, by saying he would only vote for the bill 011 condition that a provision was added permitting congressmen to shoot editors for libel. On Tuesday, in spite of the general deter initiation not to allow the unpleasant and distracting question of currency inflation to disturb with the harmony of the parly at this session, a general and hot disc ussion of that hobby was precipitated upon the house bv Judge Kelly, ot Pa., who tool; advantage of the committee of the whole to make a long ;speei h in tavor of his "X interconvertible bond scheme. Butler followed with a rigor ous speecli on the same side. It looked as il tbcj debate would be interminable an 1 there w as no end of the mischief (to the republi can party) it threatened. But 011 Tuesday evening the republicans held a caucus and agreed that next day Kelly must be choked off and the debate stopped, which was accord ingly done. The determination is to keep the question down entirely until after the !iol- idays, when it will come up again on the naked issue of a resumption of specie pay ment. "While the inflationists have undoubt edly a majority in the house, they have no hope of passing any bill through the senate and still less of having it approved by the president. Tom Scott's bill for a subsidy in aid of his Texas Pacific railroad has been duly intro duced into both houses and referred, and he lias high hopes of its passage, but no ore else seems to share his confidence. It is said, however, that Scott has entered into a dan gerous combination with the friends of a cheme to refund the cotton tax, and the two working together, are regarded as very form idable. oniKi: m vnhits. It is said to be quite amusing, on the re us sembling of the members of congress, to hear the various excuses given by different members for their defeat in November. Third term, nepotism ami Louisiana were among the leading excuses, but all centered in the chief cause (irant. Butler alone at tributes his defeat to the advocacy of curren cy inflation. From Pennsylvania the mem bers of both parties seemed to agree that the desire of the people lo break up the rule of Cameron caused the republican defeat in that state. Dave (iage, the defaulting Chicago City Treasurer, who was Hied last week at Wait kegan on a criminal prosecution for embez zlement, has been acquitted. The Chicago papers generally denounce the verdict in un measured terms, the Tinas .stigmatizing it a the stupid action of a doen of Lake county "grangers.'' The case was a very simple one. Gage was elected treasurer of Chicago as a "reformer,' promising that, whereas his pre decessors had made a good deal of money by loaning the city funds in their charge, he (Gage.) would pay over to the city all money he might make in that way. Gage, on these promises, was elected, and thereupon pro ceeded (0 loan the city funds (contrary to law) to Tom, Dick aud Harry, and within a year accounted to the city for .$1:50,000 thus earned as interest. But :u the midst of this loose business the panic occuned, nnd then Gage found that Ton, Dick and Harry, who had paid such handsome sums ns interest, were unable to pay back the principal of their loans; and when David c.aave n make his settlement, he was ome .fiOO.OOO short. That it was a clear case under the law of cm bczzlement was unquestionable ; but Gage's defence was that the City Council, by accept ing the 41:50,000 interest ho had paid them, had sanctioned and constructively authori.i'd the questionable practice of loaning or per - sonally borrowing and using the city lunds, , J , ' ,, ... .. and were therefore equally responsible WiU. him for whatever loss accrued from '- practice. And on th's flimsy plea i.iage has been acquitted: The upshot and sum-total of th- result of j the three days' deliberation ol the Kiehmonii ( heap Transportation Couvcr.tion last week is summed up in the following abstract of the icsolutions that were finally adopted: 1. A recommendation of the four civat water routes recommended by the Senate Committee, and the Hennepin canal. V.
