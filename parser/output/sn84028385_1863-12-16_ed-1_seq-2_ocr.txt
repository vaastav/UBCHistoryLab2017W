"WAEBE1T, O. WEOXESDA x DECEMBER lath, I8S. WESTERN RESERVE CHRONICLE For 1864. AT THE OLD PRICE FOR CASH IN ADVANCE! The old Westem Reserve Chronicle, which has been a weekly visitor to thou sands of happy fire-sides in Trumbull and adjacent Counties, for nearly fifty years, hopes to be welcomed by the children and grandchildren of its early patrons for a century or two more. -The present pub lishers of the Chbokicle will spare no pains to continue it acceptable to all its old and faithful trends, and to render it an agreeable companion and counsellor to as many new ones as may choose to make its acquaintance. Now is the time for new subscribers to begin, and for old ones to renew their subscriptions. These flush times are paradoxical as it may seem almost ruinous to papers published on the old terms in vogue for generations among country printers. We mean the credit system. It will not work these times. It takes cash, and lots of it, to buy paper and ink, and to hire labor. It is all cash, cash, cash no long credits allowed, for everything can be sold now for the ready pay. How then can the country publisher trust out his paper to low paying subscribers, year after year, when the cash is required of him T It can't be did. We have become tired of trying to do it. Hereafter our motto shall be "Cash in advance, or no paper." We have been thinking the matter over, and are satisfied it will be better for both ubscriber and publisher. We will have hut one price O.vi Dollak and Fiitt Cents is AdTasc. This rule will be inflexible. We are determined to try it for one year, let it work as it may. We do pot wish, if we can avoid it, to raise the price of out paper, although we think the general advance in almost everything else would justify us in so doing, but we will adopt and adhere to the advance system. There fore we give notice that no name will in future be added to our subscription list, unless the order is accompanied with the money. We will not send out any pa pers after the 

FIRST OF FEBRUARY. 1864, that have not been paid for in ad- j ranee. The third business year of the present firm commences at that time, and as several weeks will elapse between now and then, we think ample notice win have been given to all. We hope to re- Vn ,nator nart. If not all. of Our two thousand subscribers; but to do so, it will be absolutely necessary for those in arrears to call and settle up, either by note or cash, and pay for a year in ad vance. Those that fail to do this, must expect to have their names erased from our list, and their accounts placed in the hands of a collector. Now, friendsone and all, give us your material aid and sign of approval in this enterprise. Money is reported plenty. The Chromcle is offered very cheap. Just think if it at a cost of less than three . A w V Xi man cVinnlrl Ka without his county paper, when it can be had at so trifling cost. Bear in mind our new terms: One Dollar and Fifty Cents in Advance. All ' papers stopped when the subscription ex pires. Those who have accounts against us, for wood, Ac, will please call and get re ceipts. Should we by mistake, erase the names of any who have paid, let us know at once. The Draft in Trumbull County. In a few weeks the draft wheels will be put in motion, and " first class men " will have all the chances in their favor for drawing prizes. From the manifest indifference of the people on the subject, we are inclined to think that very little, if any, effort will be made to avert a draft in this county. The case is far dif ferent in the other counties of this Con gressional District, and in fact through- out the State generally. In other coun ties, meetings are being held, and liberal and persistent efforts made to raise the quotas of men required. We observe that in every instance where energetic efforts are put forth, the recruits are Teadily obtained. Trumbull county must furnish about 370 men as its quota, either voluntarily or by draft. While it is not unreasonable to hope that those who are not subject to the operations of the draft, will co-operate with those who are, in of fering such increased, or additional boun ties as will induce and pecuniarily justify men to volunteer, the latter class must not be indifferent about the matter Be cause the younger class of men who are in for the draft hare not been accustomed to move in military matters, nor are so fortunate as to be- represented in the county Military Commute, they must not supinely fold their arms in hopeless de spair. There is nothing like being up and doing, ' with a heart for any fate ; still achieving, still pursuing." We pre sume the people are waiting for some of those accustomed to move in these mat ters to start the ball in motion. Perhaps the Committee considers it a hopeless undertaking. They have worked hard and faithfully in other emergencies when men were wanted, and we know they re . oeive 1 for their pains a " kick for every copper." We believe Heaven helps thoBA who help themselves," and we further believe that Heaven and patri otism will put it into the hearts of the men of means whom the law has placed - beyond 1 be maelstrom f the draft, to help the boys in their eff.irts to raise the iuota by volunteers. It is true that the clat liable to a draft are not the men of the most wealth, of greatest personal in fluence, or highest social positions. These advantages mostly attach to riper years and greater experience. Recruiting for the National armies is really the mart important business of the day. The xtroidinary inducement held .out by Government, attests that fact. Volunteering has been rained to a v : i . . i i T l . . i c .1 jiicd smuuru. ukii iiue Mum me tifneral Government pays to every new recruit $302, and to every old soldier who - ra-enliat $402. Local bounties made up of individual subscriptions mipht be made to increaaa the amounts to $500 and $600. The volunteer could then leave home with tue fullest assurance that in" wt-tcuucih upuu uim Hui pot sutler . during his temporary absence. The Question we have now to nut U . hhall there be an effort made to fill our junta by volunteers. : It will require en erry and activity to arouse the public - mind to. that pitch of interest necessary : in the premises. Whatever if to be done, if it be done at all, must be done quickly. The remaining days of grace are few. Hon Daniel S. Dickinson's Lecture - The second lecture of the Polemic Course, on the evening of the 9th inst.. was the greatest literary treat ever enjoy by Warren audience. Mr. Dickinson's high reputation, which for years has been national, had led our people to anticipate a lecture of more than ordinary ability ; and great as the public expectations were, we think in every instance they were more than met. The lecture was sublime in thought, irresistible in the force of its logic, and radiant and fragrant with the choicest flowers of rhetoric. We feel it would be futile to attempt to convey to those of our readers who had not the pleasure of hearing the lecture, even a faint idea of its manner and matter. It was animate with "thoughts that breathe and words that burn." The theme, which was, "The Union as it was, and is, and is to be," could not be otherwise than in tensely interesting to an American audi ence at this eventful period of National history. The lecturer started out with a refer ence to the foundation principles of hu man society. The primary duty of man is plain. It Is embodied in the golden rule. Equality is the law that rules all nature. Dews, sunshine and shower fall on all alike. All are fed and warmed by the same elements, and all nature shows that man was created equal. In every age there have been attempts to overrule this law. Most of the wars that have in carnadined the earth with human gore, had their origin in efforts to violate the law of equality, by the selfish and ambi tious struggling for artificial caste, to in vest tyranny in power, making a few the lords over the many. In the establish ment of our government, ita founders re pudiated the false ideas of European ar istocracies, and bad dared to pluck hoary headed tyranny by the beard. But the great work of reform is yet incomplete. The time to determine whether the tree of liberty should be plucked up, and the temple of freedom destroyed had come. Our Union is a second land of promise, and the popular flat is that this govern ment must be maintained at all haaards. We will not give up to turbulance and faction. This great war of rebellion will leave some elements of utility behind. The Ration will eventually be freer, pmrer and stronger than ever. The law of self- preservation is an inherent attribute of national as well as individual being. Xne President must be sustained. Habeas corpus must yield to the terrible exigen cies of war, when its exercise may endan ger the Government. A free press that great pioneer of human progress when it darkly whispers treason, must come beneath the iron rule of martial law. The struggle in which we are engaged is to maintain law, order and peace, and to punish treason. The whole epergies of the Government are required to crush the rebellion. The lecturer approved of confiscation. It is one of thej lawsof war by which the enemy is crippled. Slavery should not be saved. Government should assert its power in arguments that would be felt. Our fathers sought to establish liberty ; the rebels seek to establish slavery. The contest involves extermination. Free dom must triumph. Those that are not for the Government boldly, are against it, and more hurtful than open enemies, whether in the cabinet or field. In an emergency like this, political parties forjned on questions of internal policy, should retire. The question now is, shall we have a Government with any policy whatever. A a people wo have had the fruits but none of the penalties before of greatness. We must meet our duty as our fathers met theirs. They could have submitted without dishonor, but we cannot without a disgrace to civilization. We are already immortalized in the Pantheon of history. Better that a whole generation bdawept off than that our institutions be ij?fed. and we yield to the violence of rebellion. There are those who draw a distinction between the Administration and the Gov ernment. They are for the Government but against the Administration. They for get that the Government has no hands nor tongue, no faculty to speak or act, except through the Administration. The Government has no other way of mani festing its intentions or authority. Here the lecturer illustrated the absurdity of the position of those who, while they claim to be for the Government, refuse assistance to the Administration, by de scribing a stage coach filled with passen gers. The horses become unmanageable and start off madly along the verge of a precipice. The passengers cry for help the driver holds fast to the reins, and struggles to check the flying team. As the stage sweeps by, some of the people are in favor of trying to assist the driver in his efforts to control the flying team, and rush to the rescue. But there are others who stand by and say, no ! we are in favor of the proprietors, we are in fa vor of the coach, we are in favor of the passengers, and in fact we are in favor of the team, but we are opposed to the dri ver! We did not recommend his ap pointment, and won't help him in his dif ficulty. This illustration, pictured far more strikingly than we can reproduce it, was so apt and hitting that the audience endorsed it with marks of most decided approbation. Were Benedict Arnold now living, he would probably be a Confederate general. In the great day of accounts he can whi ten his character by comparing it with Jeff. Davie'. Slavery as a political power has depart e 1. The Antony who comes to honor it with an oration hereafter, will come to bury, not to praise, it. Though it can boast of a venerable antiquity, it has al ways been pursued in every free land.and faded before civilization. . American ! very was secure from external foes, had it not discovered that it had powers like Aladin's lamp could form and control conventions, draw up resolutions, frame platforms, nominate and elect candidates. Like the daughters of the horse-leech, it cried give, give, give. Its strength final ly proved ita weakness. The people grew tired of its usurpations, and in attempt ing to force slavery on the Nation, th South"killed the goose that laid the gold en egg." All good men will look forward to early emancipation. He who shall break down slavery shall live forever in the affections of the people. The rebellion was organized to realize the dream of an empire reared on the ruins of this, which should be a slave oli garchy with cotton for its king. ' We are on a pivot in the world's pro gress; are creating materials for a more glorious history than the world has ever read. Proivdence works out great events by secondary means. Time has advanced a century at a single bound, and human ity is being inspired with new thoughts, more generous impulses, and a more lib eral democracy. Our national prospects are encouraging. The terriflic struggle is attaining its finality. Liberty and Union will gloriously triumph. Freedom shall be universal in this ocean bound Repub lic from the regions of perpetual frost to where unfading verdure fringes the dark flashing wateta of the Gulf, the sUrry banner of the fair goddess shall wave for ever. When the men who have caused this rebellion chall ree themselves as the peo ple see them not as Presidents, Senators and Generals, but as murderers, thieves and perjured monsters, they will call up on the hills and mountains to fall on them. But loyal men can have no such miserable future. Blessings often come disguised in afflictions. Judas betrayed his Savior, but it brought the world sal vation. The rebellion may prove the sal vation of the nation, by rooti ng out the teeds of death inherent in it while slave ry existed. The lecturer passed a glowing and mer ited eulogy on woman, for the good in fluence she exerts in the National cause. As the lecturer drew toward his conclu sion, he forcibly remarked that all must be true to the Constitution. Slavery was DO part of that instrument. The Consti tution will not grieve nor die, even though the last fetter of slavery hhould be bro ken. The Union shall continue to live, the pride of mankind, to bless and be blessed, amid the strug gles of expiring ages. In our present contest for existence we shall ac cumulate the manly muscle and moral force that will establish thii as a land ef liberty for all, a home for the down trod den and oppressed of the world. In our imperfect sketch of Mr. Dickin son's lecture we do not presume to do him anything like justice. But we take pleasure in noting bis radical and liberal positions on the slavery question now, as a prominent indication of the great change going on in the public mind on that subject, Although in 1860 a Demo.-, orat of the Breckinridge wing, he is now one of the ablest and most untiring cham pions of Union and Liberty. Truly do "revolutions cause an upheaval of men's thoughts, and turn them into different channels." President's Message. our first page we publish the An nual Message of President Lincoln. The document is remarkable for ita brevity a commendable feature end its com pactness of style. President Lincoln throws swfigorou originality into all his public documents that indicates to the popular mind he is a straight-forward. matter-of-fact man, while his goodness'of heart, and honesty of purpose, beam out on every line of what he writes or says. We have no fault-finding criticisms to make on the Mersage. We will leave that to the little mole-eyed politicians of the copperhead school. They will not find anything good in it, but the loyal and true will say amen to its noble enuncia tions. We are gld to see that the Presi dent holds fast to the Emancipation Proc lamation. That is the bugle blast of freedom that is arousing the nation from the stupor of Slavery. On the leading features of policy indi cated by the President, we shall have something to say, perhaps in our next issue. In the mean time we trust it will have the close reading and reflection it merits from those who may first receive it through the Chronicle. Small Swindling It seems that some small scoundrel who bails from this town, is attempting to play the old game of inducing publishers of newspapers at a distance, to advertise a book which he pretends to publish, of course not intending to pay for the adver tising, and by means of the advertisement induce credulous people to send money by mail to purchase the book, which they would never see, nor their money again, either. . The following letter will explain the matter. Of course there is no such farm in Warren, as "B. H. Robb A Co., Pub lishers":

SouieUxiy has been hit ! If the reader wishes to know, let uiiu re call the old adage, ' lis the ttuck pig that squeals." Mr. CoiL-liluliou takes umbrage and tiles exceptions to my article reporting somebody's conversation over Morgan's es cape. Like every one who is guilty, he at once sets liiuinelf to work to hunt up a city of relume. There are two ways of Uoing this. Caiu, when the Almighty j asked him where his brother A bel was, pur-J bued one course and boldly told a lie. Mr. i Constitution pursues the other course, (we I say this charitably ) and, "whipping the j devil around the slump" tints, that the reported conversation was private. l'Ue next step in his defence reminds i one ol that set up by a vagabond who was arrested for stealing a ham. The rascal made two points; 1st, lie had never sto len the ham; -d. If he did steal the ham, he was hungry, and thought the world owed him a living, and therefore he took it. So with Mr. Constitution, tie in substance declares, 1st That thecouver-j sation as reported did not occur, and 2d, It it did occur, it was private and ought not have been reiiorted. Astute logic 1 able reasoning 1 eminently worthy of the wise-acre who presides over that palladium ot copperhead liberties, the Constitution.' It he wielded so trenchant a blade during the late political canvass (and rumor aaith he did) all wouder at the result in Trum bull County ceases. Rut. to sneak seriously, did I reuort a private conversation? Mr. Constitution hints that I did; he dare not say I did.- the conversation, as leported, was opened by Mr. Copperhead himself (he says he never intrudes his opinions! O no! not he!) in a public office, during basinets hours, in the presence of Jits persons becides himself. These persons were two Main street busi ness men, a Market street merchant, a young lad (who whistled you know) and a well known farmer. These persons were all present during the conversation, saw Mr. Copperhead enter, nearu mm volun teer his statements, and remained after his departure, to finish their business which be had interupted. Now Mr. Con stitution knows well enough, if he knows anything about it at all, that this state ment is exactly true, every word of ef. It he is anxious to have the matter proved by witnesses, I imagine that he can readily be accommodated. How much reason he had, in the light of these tacts, to claim that the conversation was private, to cast out slurs about my veracity, my trust worthiness, and such gammon, I think a discerning public can appreciate. I have been informed by others that the eentlenian claims to have said in addition ho what was reported, something to this eflect: that Dave lod had also done dir ty work to get into the Abolition party originally. 1 do not recollect it, and do not see now it neipa mm. any it lie uid say so. still 1 willingly add it to thereat of the conversation, for I believe in "Hir ing the devil liu due, and am not at present aware of any reasou why I should not eraiit to Mr. Constitution, that allien 1 would concede to his satanic iunje-.tv. Certainly the small degree of difference supposed by many to exist between their respective characters, should not militate adversely to the lormer. lie will accept my thanks for hut gen erous advice (he never intrudes, you know) and I hope it "may do me good in after years : at least 1 hope that youth is my only crime, and that I may not belong to those, who are foolish in spite of their nature, age, and good early training. Mr. Constitution, thinks lam not tram meled by the rules of good society, in that I report private conversation. I think the candid reader is satisfied on that score, No sir, Mr. Constitution, your "private dodge" wont avail you anything. It is a flimsy covering and the wolfs teeth are plainly visible, tlut let us see how much deference this stickler for good manners, himself pays, to that which offends the eye or ear of refinement. In his issue of Nov. -4th, we bud the lollowing delecta ble and choice morceau, written express ly for his paper. "We're coming. Father Abraham, From Ohio's hills and lakes.

About this time Mr. Constitution felt weak in the knees, like Belshazzar of old, and, fearing lest his defense might be a "lame duck," he winds np his phillipic with a series of questions to "Union, uy whose answers he proposes to decide whether I am a genuine Unionist or a Pharisee. He roars like a patriotic lion, but even the very wording of the questions reveals the trembling bray and long ears of cop- perheadism. Having beard such before. 'Union is not so entirely "demoralized but that he will make an effort to reply. Answer 1st- I am in favor of prosecuting the war for the maintenance of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union; but 1 am not in favor of prosecuting the war for the purpose of securing the rebels in arms the right to hold slaves or to vote at elections. Permit me to say further, sir, that I do not profess these principles, and at the same time employ all -the means in my power to embarrass, discredit and, break down the Administration upon which rests the hope ot the country; to publish from week to week, a paper teeming with abuse of the best President we have had since the days of Washington. To endorse res olutions declaring that our government is in greater danger from Mr. Lincoln than from Jeff.

To sneer at every wise measure adopted to crush out the rebellion; to vilify the fair fame of our gallant generals, while applauding the conduct of every rebel sympathiser in the North, from Vallandieham down; to inveigh against the necessarily enor mous expenditure of the . public money; to stab the credit of our legal tender cur rency; to do, and say, and publish in fact those very things which tend to di vide the loyal people of the North, and which are hailed with rapturous applause from Richmond to the Rio Grande, and are most pleasant to Jefferson himself.

Answer 5th. 1 believe such rightsare very valuable and worth much: and that nei ther the President nor tien. Burnside may at his mere whim or pleasure in vade them. Rut as this question hint", doubtless at the "blessed Mtrtyr." I wish to be fully understood. Mr. VhI landighams rights were not invaded at pleasure. I regard it as a case wherein the authorities were most abundantly justified in the course they pursued; and I was one of the majority of One Hundred Thousand Ohio freemen, who said "Amen" to the whole preceed in gs. If you desire it you ein move for a new trial in the next presidential campaign; and. then, like the men who wound one end of a rope around his neck, while the other whs attached to a mad bull. I think you will soon "see just where you missed it." Now, my dear sir, your questions have been fully answered, and if you desire any more light on dark points you can readily have it for the a.-king; or, as you are doubtless a very modet man, it is ossi ble you may get it without. In conclusion, permit me to assume an equal liberty with yourself, ana propose a few questions, not perhps to decide upon your sincerity, (as in my case you propose to do,) for that is scarcely an open ques tion; but to satisfy your hnts of admiring friends that you are really "sound on the American Eagle." 1st. Were the Southern leaders justmed in organizing this rebellion? Zd. Ua you think they are traitor, and deserve death? 3d. Do you think Mr. Lincoln is a traitor? 4th. Would you have the war speedily close by a Republican Administration, or would yourefer to have it continued un til 1865, in hopes of electing a Peace Democrat, who may compromise matters? 5th. Would you consent to a restoration of the Union with Slavery left out? If not, why do you claim to be a Union man? 6th. Would you consent to a compro mise guaranteeing to slave holders all their rights existing previous to their re bellion? 7th. Are you in lavor of rejealing the $300 clause in the conscription act? 8th. Do you desire any future Congress to repudiate the financial measures of the last Congress, and repudiate the public debt, or any part thereof incurred in sup pressing the reliellion? 9th. Are you in favor of the United States Government assuming the rebel debts? 10th. Are you in favor of furni-liing men and money for the pro-ecution of the war under the present Emancipation Proclamation? llth. Do you endorse Valhindigham's course previous to his arrest by Burnside, and his running of the blockade after !e ing sent South. Now, sir, please toe the mai k, and no dodging, nor prevarications, nor "whip ping the devil around the stump," but boldly show your hand. 

UNION. WARREN, Dec. 14th, 1863. Eds. Chronicle: I wish to call the at of your readers to the subject of Ventila tion. In these days, when we are so jeal ous of our rights, do not let us forget our right to breathe the pure air which God has given us, to invigorite our bodies, to renew our life. Thousands do foraet it every day of their lives. They sleep in close rooms. send their children to school, where too often they are made to breathe impure air for six hours per day; they co to church and breathe and rebreathe the breath of hundreds, the consequence is they are scolded by their preacher be cause of their drowsiness, while their chil dren are flogged by their teacher because they are dull and restless. Hundreds will attend a public meeting and sit for hours, in a room so poisoned with the exhalations from the breath and bodies of the audience, that is absolutely suffocating to one going in from the fresh out door air. We can scarcely realize the amount of disease contracted by breath' ing impure air. - Pure air is composed of 20 per eent. of oxygen, 79 of Nitrogen, and one of carbonic acid gas. After it has once been breathed, it has parted with one sixth of its oxygen, and taken up an equivalent amount of carbonic acid gas, and were the same air to be breathed six times, it would have parted with all of its oxygen, and could no longer sustain life. Carbonic acid jf as is destructive to animal life and combustion, and if an un due amount collects in a room, we feel drowsy, our heads begin to ache, and dizzi ness sometimes follows. We have stated the amount of carbonic acid gas in pure air is one per cent; in expired air it is from four to eight per cent; and it can be proven that this, with the other exhala tions of the body of one person, contam inate about ten cubic feet of air per min ute. A few evenings since, I, with about four hundred others, sat in a public hall, in which there was no ventilation, except an occasional opening of the door, for one hour. The air in that room was all con- laminated in 25 minutes, unfit to be breathed after that, yet we sat there and took in that most unwholesome air for 35 minutes, until some one had thought and care enough to let down a few windows from the top, and so let the poison escape, and a little reviving air come in. We are all fastideous about our food and drink, and the manner of taking it. We will not eat upon the plate of another, or put the cup a friend has drank from, to our own lips, yet we will drink into our systems over and over again, the foul and disgusting em u itioin of putrescence and disease, which often load the air of crow d ed rooms. e rightfully shun the aiTOBrh of tbe .l;,lr un,l c....i;,l il i-,, i i . dirty and squalid, the diseased, and ue no garments that have twD worn by , . , them, bat We trill resort to crowded.

Just think of breathing such a loathsome and deleterious air for 35 minutes! If all would think of it, we should have better ventilated rooms. I heard a gentleman say he rither breathe impure air, than have tbe wind blow; on his head from an open window It is diffiult to tell which is better of the two evils.

Wallace Brace was born in Willams field, Ashtabula County, August 28th, 1812, and was but a few weeks past 21, when he was killed in that terrible strug gle at Chickamaug. Having lost his pa rents at an eiirly age, he was, for years be fore his death, thrown almost entirely on his own resources. At the commencement of the rebellion, he was livini; in Vernon, and enlisted among the first of the three years volunteers. He was at the taking of Bowling Green, was wounded in the sanguinary contest of Shiloh. was in the battles of Perryville and Stone River, and in all the affrays in which his company, Company A, 41st O. V. I., took a part. In the battle of Chickamauga, his regi ment had been in action aboui .wo hours on Saturday, 19th, and had exhausted their ammunition. A call was made for volunteers to go to the rear for ammuni tion, which, as the enemy's sharpshoot ers were in the Hank and rear, was a hazardous undertaking. Wallace was among the first to offer to go. He went, sod bad returned, and was unloading it, when be whs shot through the brain and killed instantly. In a short time his body was in the enemy's hands, and has nev-r been recovered, and has been bur ied, or never buried at all, as were thou sands of others of our brave dead, on that bloody field. Wallace was pre-eminent among hisasso ciates. for his uncommon m ental endow nietits. From his earliest years, in school. he was unrivalled in his classes for his ease and rapidity in mastering his lessons, and for his thirst for knowledge. He was dist inguished also, for a clearness of view and a depth of thought, far beyond his years. As was said by a man who was rallied for making so much of an associate of Wallace, "a mere boy," the boy had a wisdom and views in advance of some who claimed to be men. All who have par ticipated in Lyceums of which he was member, remember his skill and strength in arkruiiient, when he was but a mere lad. lt was often prophesied of him, that he would one day, make a brilliant and use ful figure in the history of his country; but alas! all these bright hopes and fond anticipations of admiring friends, are bur ied in an early tomb.. He was actuated during his entire life, by a noble ambition, or laudable emulation, which was ' free from envy. He was determined to excel, but by open effort, and never by dragging down a rival. He had marked out for himself a career of honor and usefulness. In one of his last letters to me, in reply to a query what he would do it he sur vived the war, he said, "I will go to Bchool, obtain a thorough education, and make a man ot myself. lo a sister; he said, "with my earnings as a soldier, which he had saved almost entire, "1 will go to Old Yale, and oh ! will not it be glorious, to make those old halls, which so often ring with the youthful appeals of noble men, resound to my own voice." Some may smile at his boyish enthusiasm, but it was a noble one, one to be imitated. In character, he was remarkable for his energy and resolution, and a frankness, which sometimes bordered on bluntness, but was relieved by his generosity and the firmness ot his friendship. As a soldier, he characterized, more by a clear knowledge of his duties, and calm un flinching determination and courage, than by that reckless prowess so dazzling often, but not so reliable. Whatever he undertook, he knew what he was doing, and did it coolly and quietly. Though he enlisted early in the summer of 18bl, he had never been home, nor absent from his post. Though he suffered his share of the privations ot a soldiers life, he never complained but once, and that was du ring the months of inactivity under Buell, so nearly fatal to our cause. But with all his brilliant promise, and his noble qualities, and bravery, he is gone; and his life is laid as a sacrifice, be fore the. Moloch of Slavery. But how many such noble lives have been lost in this slave-holder's rebellion? How many such hare been lost in Trumbull County alone? How many brave and talented youth have fallen in this unholy crusade againstreeaom and uovernmentr Ana it has (feen so all over the land. From the pine clad hills of Maine, to the gold en sands of California, youtn, virtue, ana genius have been laid, a holacaust, on on the altar of country. This is the great est loss of the war. Money and loss of commercial prosperity are but a dust in the balance. But as we cherish the mem ory of our Revolutionary heroes, so should and will we cherish the names, virtues, and deeds, of the brave youths who have fallen in this our second struggle for free dom, and self government.

The Secretary of the Treaaurjr has not yet given notice of any intention to withdraw this popular Loan from Sal at Par. and antil tea day' noUc is given, th undersigned, as "GeBeraA aabaerlptloii Agent," will continue to supply th public. Th whole amount of th Loan authorized is Fir Hundred Millions of Dollars. Nearly Fear II and red .Wllliosu have heeat already ubaeribed for and paid lata tha Tree a ry, mostly within th last seven months. Th large demand from abroad, and th rapidly in creasing horn demand for as a th basis for cir culation by tbeNa ional Banking Associations bow organizing in all part of th country, will, ia a very short period, absorb th balance. Sale hay lately ranged frm tea to fifteen million weekly, frequently exceeding three millions daily, and a it is well known that the Secretary ef th Treasury has ample and unfailing resource i a th Duties ea Imports and Internal Roven uea, and ia th iau of th Interest bearing Legal Te nder Note, it is al most a certainty that he will not find it necessary, for a long to com, to seek a market for any ether long or permanent Loans. THE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL OF WHICH ARE PAYABLE IN eou. Prndenc and self interest mast fore the minds of thoee contemplating the formatios of National Banking Associations, as well as th minds of those having idle money on their h ands, to the prompt conclusion that they should lose ao tun ia subscri bing to this most popular Loan. It will soon be be yond their reach, and adva nee to a handsome pre mium, as was the result with thSera Thirty" Loan, when it was all sold and could ao longer be subscribed for at par. II is) a Mi per Ceat. Leaa, tha Iatereat and Principle payable la Calm, thaa yielding aver Sine per Ceat. per asssn at th present rate of premium on coin. The Government requi res all duties on imports to be paid in Coin : these duties hare for a lone tin. 0 past amounted to over a Quarter of a Million of Dollars daily, a sum nearly three times greater than that required in the payment of the interest on all the 5-20's and other permanent Loans. So it is hoped that tbe surplus Coin in tbe Treasury, at no distant day, will enable the United States to re sume specie payment upon all Iiabilites. The Loan is called 5-20 from the fact that whilst the Bonds may run for 20 years yet the Govern ment has a right to pay them off in Gold at par. at any time after 5 years. The Interest I paid half-yearly, vis: oa the first days of November and May. Subscribers can hare Coupon Bonds, which are payable to bearer, and are $50l $100, and $1000: or Registered Bonds of same denominations, and ia addition, $o,0C0 and 10,000. For Banking purposes and for investments of Trust-monies tbe Registered Bonds are preferable. These 5-20's cannot be taxed by States, cities towns, or counties, and the Government tax on them is only one and a-halfper vent, on the amount o income, when the income of tbe holder exceeds Six Hundred dollars per annum ; all ether lavest men ts. such ss income from Mortgages. Railroad Stock and Bonds, etc, must pay from threw to ire per cent tax on tbe income. Banks and Bankers throaght tha Country will continue to dispose of th Bonds; and all orders by mail or otherwise promptly attended to. The inconvenience of a few days delay in the delivery of the Bonds is unavoidable, the demand being so geat: but as interest commences from th day of subscription, ao loss is occasioned ; and every effort is being made to diminish th delay.
