THREE NEGROES HANGED HY A MASKED MOB AT CRKN1IAM. THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY WERE ACCUSED MURDER OF BOLTON. Special.Telegrain to the Statesman. Buk.viiam, December a. Our city waa the scene early this morning of one f the most startling tragedies evor known In this part of the state. ' Just one month ago, at the late elections and during the excitement of the same.a highly respec table and good white citizen Dewees Bolton, was assassinated by negroes at Lott's store, near the town of Washington, in the northern part of this county, on the banks of the Brazos. There was considerable excitement at the time. The negroes concerned in the crime, wkich It was charged had been instigated by white republi can mischief makers, fled. It was subsequently reported the negroes of the surrounding community took up the cause of the assassins and threatened to arm themselves and "rise" and mob the whitos. On this account, en the 8th nit., Governor Ire land was appealed to for aid In case the emergency ehould arise. After this, the sheriff snceeded, with an armed posse of citizens, in surrounding a house near Brenham, in which the negro assassins were hiding. Sevoral were captured and landed in jail here. It was feared at the time that a mob would re sult, and every precaution taken by the authorities to prevent an attack on the jail. The denouement can be soon told. About one o'clock this morning, as the mists of midnight bung over the city-at that silent hour "when ghosts troop home to churchyards," a body of horsemen rode into the town. The clatter of their horses' hoofs echoed against the walls of Courthouse square, ominous- lv and with a strange aad startling sounu. iue.. spurs jingled, and the chance wanderer in the silent streets, bad no difficulty in perceiving these cavallors were all heavily armed ; that they wore black masks on their faces, and their number-also a striking and alarming circumstance, was about seventy-five or one hundred. It looked like one of the scenes in the early days of Texas, when the "Regulators" struck terror to the criminals of East Texas It waa evident the mysterious cavalcade was bent on some startling act. And it was.. The objective point was the jail in which the murderers of Dewees ' Bolton were confined. By some means, and under a fair pretext, some of the , a ... t nut the iatlor. H is need- crown uiumu w fev. r . less to go into details. How the maskers secured possession of three negro prisoners chareed with the IBolton assassination, it were hard to say. But they got the three negroes, alleged to I e concerned in the mnrder-their names being AH. Jones, SantansJoaesand ShadFelder. The negroes were, without delay r ceremony, taken about one mile north of town. Here the mob halted in the dusk and gloomy shadows of a large tree, that throws its huge branches arching across the road. Without much ado, the trio were swung up to the most convenient limbs of th. tree, and there left suspended, as an Ww"" in of the swift vengeance that can be meted out ' to criminals by the people who fear the leniency of the courts. , The corpses were left hanging over the road To day the town was as quiet as a church yard Thlslimeit i. the criminal population that have .
