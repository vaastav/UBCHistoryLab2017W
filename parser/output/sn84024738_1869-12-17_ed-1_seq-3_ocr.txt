Special telegram to Hie Dispatch. Ciiaki.ottevij.le, December lfJ, 18G9. Our town was this morning shocked by one of the most fearful tragedies that lia ever startled any community. Dr. A. R. Oliver, recently from England and promi nent lv connected with emigration schemes, was shot and instantly killed by Mr. George S. Aver, of Loudoun county. Both parties are of the highest respectability, and were men of considerable meatus. Dr. Oliver was, to some extent , known In Richmond, having delivered one or more public ad dresses in your city. lie was a gentleman of fine appearance and prepossessing man ners, of large information, and exceedingly intelligent. STATEMENT OF DK. OLIVER'S FAMILY. Mr. Aver and Dr. Oliver had been on the most friendly terms, Dr. Oliver having loaned considerable money to the former. This morning about sunrise Mr. Aver came to the house and inquired for the Doctor, who was then asleep in bed. Mr. Brown, a brother-in-law, awakened the Doctor, say ing " Mr. Averts here, and wishes to see you/"' The Doctor came to his chamber door in his night clothes, where he met Aver, and extended liishand, saying "How j are you, old fellow ? " Aver replied " I do I not know that I can take your hand," or something to that effect, and immediately commenced firing. Oliver retreated into his chamber, where his wife was in bed, pursued by Aver, who continued tiring un til his victim was slain. Four shots were tired, one taking effect in the breast, another severing an artery above the heart, and a third lodged in the throat. TUK STATEMENT OK MK. A YEP. is to the effect that last May Dr. Oliver and his wife came to Ayer's house in Loudoun, where they were treated with the utmost Kindness, and boarded for sove ral months. While there Oliver treated a daughter of Aver for consumption, and availed himself of the facilities thus afforded to seduce her. The ruin of his daughter came to Mr. Ayer's knowledge only a few days ago, and he immediately determined upon vengeance. Comingto Charlottesville last night, lie remained at the Central Hotel until this morning, when he went to Dr. Oliver's residence and inquired for lum. Was invited into the house and met Oliver at his chamber door, who extended his hand. Aver said " I cannot take your hand : 1 must have your blood for the inju ries you have done me," drawing at the same time a revolver and commencing to tire. Oliver retreated into the chamber of his wife and cot under the bed, aiul Aver, -looping down, fired twice upon him in that nosition. THE ACCUSED SURRENDERS HIMSELF. IIis victim (lead, Mr. Aver left the house at once, and, going to a magistrate, of fered to surrender himself; but the ma-i gistrate did not put him under arrest. lie then went to the house of the county jailor, where he now is, waiting for the officers of: justice to take some action. Aver has been visited at the jail by many citizens ot Charlottesville to express their, sympathy for him, and justifying the act., .Several clergymen have called?unci among them were Rev. Messrs. James IS. Taylor, John E. Hong, and George 15. Taylor, Jr., of the Baptistdenomination, who seem to have been previously acquainted with him. GKOKQE S. AVER. Mr. Ayer seems to lie about fifty years of I age, and is a man of very quiet demeanor. It is stated that he left home without the knowledge of his family, as he did not wish his sons to know what he was about to do, preferring to to take the execution of justice into his own hands. Alter lie killed Dr. Oliver, he sent a telegram to his family, say ing that he had done what he came to do. and was lodged in jail. lie i> a man of wealth and standing, and occupies a promi nent position in the Baptist church. lie re sides near Upperville, Loudoun county. THE DECEASED. Dr. A. It. Oliver is a Scotchman by birth, but was for twelve years a practicing physi cian in Birmingham, England. He came to this country about two years ago 011 a pro specting tour, and became well known throughout the State as general agent of an English company for the promotion of emi gration to Virginia. Recently he deter mined to make this State his home, and was enthusiastic in the praise of his udopted country. During the late State Agricultural Fair he was in Richmond, and delivered an address before the Agricultu ral Society. At the Fair he had on exhibi tion a self half-cocking, breech-loading, double-barreled gun, said to be a fowling piece of unusual merit, and by the sale of which he expected to make a handsome fortune. Dr. Oliver was about forty years of age. of prepossessing appearance, and very agreeable in conversation. lie leaves a wife, but no children. It is proper to add that when he met Mr. Aver lie did uot evince consciousness of having wronged liini, and manifested great surprise at his hostile attitude. Mrs. Oliver witnessed the shooting, and of course is now in a heart-broken condi tion. She has the profoundest sympathy of our people. Altogether, this is a most distressing af fair, aud to us it seenis that the families of both parties to the tragedy deserve the sin cerest sympathy. "When such occurrences are as common as they now are, it shows a terrible state of demoralization. Our law makers should inquire into the condition of the statute-books. VERDICT OF THE JURY. A coroner's jury being empanelled, after a full hearing of the evidence they rendered t lie following verdict : " We dud that the said Anthony R. Oliver was killed about 7 o'clock A.
