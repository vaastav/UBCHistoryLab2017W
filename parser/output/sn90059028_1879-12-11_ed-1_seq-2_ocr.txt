Pall Mall Gazette. An interesting archaeological discovery is reported from Palestine. An Arab who was quairying stone the other day at a place about four and a half miles from Gaza, unearthed a marble figure supposed to be a colossal god of the Philistines. The dimensions of the figure are as iollows: Three feet from the top of its head to the end of its beard 27 inches from ear to ear 13J inches from top of forehead to mouth 54 inches from shoulder to shoulder 81 inches from crown of head to waist and 64 inches the circumference of the neck. The total height of the figure is fifteen feet. The hair hangs in long ringlets down the shoulders, and the beard is long, indicating a man of ven erable age. The right arm is broken in half, while the left arm i9 crossed over the breast to the right shoulder, where the hand is hidden by the drapery of a cloth covering the shoulders. There is no inscription on the figure of the pe destal, which is a huge block carved in one piece with the figure. The statue was found in a recumbent position, bur ied in the sand upon the top of a hill near the sea. It had evidently been re moved from its original site, which is unknown.
