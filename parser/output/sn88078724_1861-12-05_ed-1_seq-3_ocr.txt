We bave done that whioh, less patriotic and perilous, tquir d many of the implements of war, aUcb aa guns, powder, ball, tenia, and camp kettles, and waa aecompabied with some of the iaoideots of military life, such as camping out, sleeping in the mad, cfco.

Tbe only queetiou was aa to its shipment; considerable doubt waa expressed as to whether or not there was sufficient roll ing slook on the railroads in North-western Ohio to transport our game aa fast as it Was' slaughtered. Night came on and we camped. The , dreams o( the party; coneideriog the bard bed, were not only enoourageing, but refreshing. Your humble servaot saw in bis visions droves of deer, herds of buffalo, and swamps full ol bear, slaughtered and smoking, ready for shipment. ' Similar visions blessed whole party, and daylight found us on our way hopeful and rejoicing. The second day was without incidents save one. A fine eovey of Quail crossed the road just in front of us; it was agretd to net thm. ''Nick" and "Gabriel" set the-net. Your bumble servant seeing the birds about to re-oross the road, jnarobed boldly out in front of them and fully understanding the Datura and hab ile of tbe bird, shook bis coat tail at them jmt as be would at a brood of chiokens, whereupon the exceedingly stupid and ill-trained covey "flushed." 'Nick" wore (at the birds of course) pulled up slakea and we proceeded on our jour ney, but riot however, until "Gabriel" bad ahown bimeelf an excellent "wing eliot" br shooting a corn shock ten teet to the south of the moel'eoutbeily bird, and we had ahown ourself an experienced eportsman by ' letting our gun fall from our bands without getting a snot, as tue oovey flew up a second time in our very face;'. ' The third day it rained hard and blow, cd cold; "it was delightful to see tie big trma roma danoinrf to tbe Cttrtll," but variably "wait for ths wagoo," but the; win "Jeff" would alwaye pat as off by the invariably coriect opioion, that tbe roads wOald get tW io a few rods, and that it was useless to stop tbe team to ride that distance," so ws continued to wslk. - We reached oar destination on Sunday evening, after fire days of most delightful travel. We pitched oar teat on tbe big branob of Dog Creek, with mud and wa ter below end woods above and around endlese and boundless woods. "Jeff" and "Tom" hauled together a mountain of logs; "Gabriel" dressed and cooked a tame duck and chiokerel, (tbe only game we bad seen, since the chicken bawks mentioned) while we cut brush for abed. That night brush and leaves were the only thing between us and the mud and water, both of which soon found their way through limb acd leaf and morning found us with our heads in the mud. We now prepared for the bunt. We had beard glowing de scriptions of game, "the woods were full," everybody taid; "haulers are averaging from two to four deer per day." We went into the woods not the least shaken in our fuith. The mountains of smoking deer and bear were not tbe lent diminished in our visions. At J 2 we returned from our tramp hav ing seen plenty of ''deer sign" but with- "Jeff" tbe fatal "Jeff," not getting a dosen buck in tbe three hours ramble through tho woods, became disoouraged, mistaking the bark of a ohickerel fur a wolf, became ecared, told by somebody that there were more turkey in the aetllements than in the woods, determined to return to the settle inenis, jand return Le did tbe whole green and cowardly party submitting to him and following his example.' We bunted in tbe settlements one day, found no turkey; but your humble servant, more lecky iban the rent, found a solitary wood chuck and on the third fire brought him triumphantly to th ground. itiie ended our hunting. We came home about as we went, wiih this differ enoe, we went out with some monoj and came back Jiat broke. We left clean and came back so dirty that our best friends did not recognize us. Our own babe stared at ns snd oried I Our friende may be a little incredulous of this story but it is true true as gos pel. Aa we hare to anawer in the future the only game tshot by the party in the woods, was one wood-chuck and enc pheasant. jCyThe report handed us for publica tion by Mrs, Bkdbh, of the donations for Soldiers, has been unavoidably crowded out of thia weeks issue, bat will appear in our next. Appointsiknt. Our friend Dr. Uomsr C. Shaw, hat been appointed - Assistant Surgeon of the 10th Ohio Regiment. This is an excellent appoinment. - Tbe Doolor is a gnod physician and will dis charge hie duties promptly snd faithfully. l&We have received another oommu nioation from the First Ohio Regiment, by our correspondent, but too lata for this isiue.

The roada became heavy and deep . . ,,. 4 o "Onward to ("not Rrlohmond but) Van wertl" was ths watchword, and onward we went, splashing, dashing, shivering and shaking in the moat approved atyle. M 9 o'clock P. M., just ten miles from ary place dc exactly at nq place, with rain above, mud below, and woods around us, Tho President's iricssngc. We received the President's Message yesterdsy at 4 o'clock P. M too late for publication this week. We will give it Army. Correspondence. We are permitted to publish the follow ing letter from Capt. J. W. Stioeboomb to bis wife io thia city. 0 If abcr won Camp Moom to 1 Libaiov, Kr., Nov. 27, 1861. j Diab Loo: We started thia morning on our march again uudur (be most glowing oircumeunoes, as U began last cigbt bout 9 o'clock to anow and continued to snow fur about one ball aa hour, and tbeo It turned to lain, and I assure you it did rain; I bed gone to Danville io tbe even ing to get a Camp stove and hud to wait until 9 o clock, Tor tbe man to finish it: and by the time we got to Camp it waa thundering, lightening and raining. Tbe Creek thia morning had risen eo high we had to chop a large tree acroea it for tbe boys to walk over on. Jt continued to rain until about II o'clock, and it then broke away and this afternoon wae a de lightful one over head, and not eo very unpleasant underneath as we are marching on a good pike. It appears as though we have tbfa luck to march in the worst of weather, as the. majority of our marches have been made in the rain and mud, yet the boys moved off cheerfully with the understanding that we are going on to join a column; embracing several Brig ades under command ol General Thomas. I m inclined to think if General Thomas ahould meet tbe enemy, he will ahow himself to he a General although many of the papers censure him lor tbe Cum berland (Jap Expedition. 1 don t think he ever had men enough to have made an attaok on the Gap, and for that reason I inter be did not press the column ae cloae ae many thought it ought to have been done, but wben it is known 1 hat be only had about 3,600 efficient men marching against an army ot 8,000; bis movements had necessarily to be very cautious and I had muoli rather see a General err on the side oi caution than rashness. I have never blamed General Thomas fur the failure to oapture tbe entire army of Zul liooffer; but it is ths Kentuukiang that are to blame for tie whole of it. Col. Garrard's regiment baa been in camp for weeks, at Wild Cat, and yet wbeo we got there they knew nothing at all about the oountry except ou the roads, ak them what kind is over that knob, oi that hill or valley, and their invariable reply wo'd be "I have never been tliar;" and it ap peared as though we oould gut no one io give us any information jr guides that knew ecarooly anything about the coun try and the Kentucky Cavalry ie not as good aa common make shift, u6iog the old woman phrase. Our btfvs know more about the oountry within 300 yards of where ihe fight took place in two hours after we got there than the Kentuck ans knew or ever will know about it. They appeared to think the only thing neoessa ry io know about the ground was imme diately in front of their works, and that only so far as they oould see without leu ving their woiks. They ihought only of repelling an attack and never apparently dreamed of following the enemy and cut ting him to pieces on his retreat. They should have explored the country all a- round and known every foot of it, and then when we ascertained that Zollscoffer waa retreating we could bavo march-d through the woods and ruobuahed bim and made the victory deoisive. I see some one wrote homo that Co. A, Capt'. Butteifield, has maiohed 50 miles further than any other .comp my in the regiment. This is not the fact, as Capt. Rickets' company, as also my own have bi.'on on every march that Co A has, and I assure you we never start on a march but we do as niuoh as any other company; the fict ie Co. B marched from London to Rockcastle River and back, 14 miles each way, faster than Capt, Butterfield's or any other company in the Regiment, excepting a part of Capt. Wbisaon's boys wliO a' oompanied n; I only stato this so that our friends may have the facte. Ever eince we came within about font milrs of Mount Vernon we have been in a most delightful country, the soil ie very rich, undulating and well watered, as theie are many email streams with quite a numher'as largo us Hocking at Lo gan, ine whole country in tins region We bare a fine cooking stove now in oar qaarters, tbe .stove-part made of sheet iron.
