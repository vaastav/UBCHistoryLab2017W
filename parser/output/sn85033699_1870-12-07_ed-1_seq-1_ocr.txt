NASHVILLE UNION AND AMERICAN. ESTABLISHED MARCH 30, 1835. says: have "The plans of Congress seem to been this: The Government issued its bonds to a company which was to a company which was build a road through a wilderness, which would need to exhaust every available means to complete the work, which would have little income until it was com pleted. Confidence was felt in tho ulti mate value of the whole work when onca brought into perfect and full operation. A mortgage was taken upon the whole property to secure the payment of the bonds, principal and interest, at their mat&ity, which' would be thirty years after their date. In the meantime the compensation for services rendered tho Government from the beginning, and the annual percentage of the net receipts of the road after its completion, were to be applied toward the discharge of the interest as far as it would go, and to the principal as the bonds successively ma tured if there should be accidentally any surplus, but no other provision for cur rent interest was stipulated or designed to be made, because none could be made without hampering the feeble and strug gling enterprise. The United States agreed to pay interest on the bonds semi-annually, because such payment was important to their market value; but this implies nothing to tho terms on which the credit of tho government, or rather its pecuniary aid, was furnished to the railroad company. These terms were promised, with such security as the company could give to repay the loan of bonds, and in the meantime to appropri ate certain specific funds toward the pay ment so far as they would go." The decision of the present Attorney General will not be forthcoming for some time, the assembling of Congress, when this question will give rise to much dis cussion. Q 

C0XG&ESSMAL. SENATE. Washington, Dec 6. Several bills, were introduced, when the Senate ad joumedjin order to complete an informal revision of standing committees.

By Mr. Fenton, authorizing the Post master General to continue the use in the postal service of the patent device, for post markingSid the more effectual can cellation of postage stamps. A resolution offered by Mr. Sherman wasadopted, calling upen the Secretary of tne Treasury for copies of the regula tions prescribed by him for the transpor tation of goods in bond from foreign countries through the United States to Canada. HOUSE. Messrs. Frank Morni, of Louisiana, Chas. II. Holmes, of New Trork, and Wm. P. Wolf, of Iowa, appeared and jtook the oath. Mr. nill introduced a bill to repeal the income tax. Referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. Similar bills were introduced by Messrs. KeUogg and Myers. First Grab of tho Land Sharks. A bill passed by the Senate at the last session extending the time for the con ttruction of a Railroad from St Croix River or Lake to the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield, came up as the regular order of business in the' morning hour. It extends the terms of the grant for seven years, from the 1st of May, 1869; provided, that thirty miles be com pleted within eighteen months, and thirty miles every year thereafter. The bill was explained by Messrs. Wilson, of Minn., and Washburn, of Wis., who stated that the length of road was ori ginally 350 miles and nearly 200 miles hive already been completed and in run ning order, the remainder under contract, and that the quantity of land required will be about 1,000,000 acres. Mr. wood opposed the but denouncing the swindling system by which the public lands had been given away to private corporations. Mr. Julian desired to have tho bill amended so as to exfjudc timbered land from the grant Mr. Lawrence desired to have coal and iron lands excluded, and to require the railroad to sell the land to actual settlers only, and in quantities not exceeding a quarter section, at not exceeding $2.50 an acre. Mr. Wilson argued that it was now ad mitted that the public lands should go to actual settlers. Congress should adopt that policy which would prove most ad vantageous to settlers and that was the opening up ot communications by rau road. After further discussion the bill was laid on the table. Mr. Logan gave notice that he would, tin Wednesday, move to suspend the rules and pass a bill abolishing the offices of admiral and vice admiial of the navy, the former at once and the latter when a vn- cancyjoccurred.

Last week there was a private wedding at the Madison avenue Baptist church, in New Yoik. The bride was the beautiful daughter of a widow, and the oldest of a family of five girls, me groom was a young man well known in business circles. None but relatives and immediate fami ly friends were present, and none unless particularly invited. On this account no ushers were engaged, and the duty of seat ing the guests devolved on the sexton of the church. Seats for the family were reserved in front, and it was arranged that afkr the family should follow the bride and groom, and tho knot should at once be tied. At the appointed time the four youuger daughters arrived m a carnage, and said to the sexton : "Give us the seats reserved for the family." This he did, and by some cruel mistaKe the next carnage con tained the pair about to be married, when, according to previous arrangement, the mother and a friend should have next ar rived. Tho young lady, feeling that should any mistake occur whereby her mother would be deprived of witnessing tho ceremony, said to the sexton : "Have the family arrived ?" , Being answered in the affirmative, the happy couple walked up the aisle to where the minister wa3 in waiting, and the knot was quietly tied. As the newly married pair were leaving thb church they met the mother of the bride in the vestibule. The old lady threw up her arms and cried aloud, "Oh, Sarah, what have you been doing?" Tho daughter then discovered the mistake, burst into tears, and throwing herself on her moth er's breast, exclaimed: "Mother, mother, I have been getting married," and the two wept as if their hearts would break. The guests atirst feared that the young wife was tnken suddenly ill, but when they learned tho cauf e of the ridiculous exhibition, they laughed as heartily as tho otners nau cnea. Bcpnlrlnjr.

SKILLET DEAD. Skillet Htys, a negro long and well known in our community, was buried on last Saturday. He came to his death by being thrown from a riding thing called a "Flying Jenny' which broke one of the cords in his neck. Skillet was a great cook and hunter, and has served up many a winter night's supper for the young men of otir place Wo partook of his last on to-night one week ago. "lie vfas formerly the slave of Dr. John B. Hays. His correct name was Osyorne, and nick named "Skillet" from the following inci dent: John M. Cook, commonly called OThus," was for sixteen years our $wn constable, and during the days of slavery was a diligent officer in the dis charge of his duties, consequently a ter $r to the negro who transgressed the laws. On one occasion he heard of Skil let being out from home (at the ringing of the 9 o'clock p. m. bell the law required all negroes to be in their quarters.) Cook went to the house where he was at, but on entering Skillet made his exit through a window unseen by Cook. Some one suggested that he might be under a skil let sitting in the room, and old man Cook actually lifted the skillet to see whether he was or nor. 'From that time Os. Hays was known tis Skillet. On Saturday we had several BUNAWAY8, one of which was the cause of a very serious accident. It appears that a num ber of young ladies at one of our public schools decided on a iamble in tho woods. For this purpose two cars were provided to convey them to the woods. While out we learn that one of the cars was backed over a bluff, throwing the young ladies out, some of whom were consider ably bruised. On their return to the school, as soon ashe young ladies had all gotton out of the car, the horses became frightened, broke and run, passing out of the school yard to the Mt. Pleasant Pike, which they took down in wild flight to the fcquare, across the square and down South Main street to the alley upon which Mr A. Barrresides, to whom the team belonged Hero it was thought they would stop, but not so, they con tinue in their mad flight down the alley to Embargo street, then down Embargo to Mechanic, dewn it to Glade, from Glade to the fence on the river, down to the river, thence up the river some hun dred yards io fin island, and yet not a thing about the car to which they wero attached or the harness upon them, strange to say, wa3 in the least damaged.: As they came down West Market, a gendeman whose name we did not leani ran in front of and endeavored to stop them; they ran over and hurt him very seriously. They also ran over a negro on South Main street, but did him no harm. BAPTISING. The colored Missionary Baptht3 had till another baptising on last Sunday, ten persons being immersed.
