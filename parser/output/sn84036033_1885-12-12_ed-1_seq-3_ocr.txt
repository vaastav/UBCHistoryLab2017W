THE SEMI-WEEKLY MINEE. BUTTE. DECEMBER 12,1885. Do street religious demonstrations as sist the cause of Christ? Winter "got in its work" last night, and the mercury went down to zero. » ■ Speaking of the cold weather, the busi ness men tersely say: "More power to it.' It remained for 8am Jones to say "demi john Methodism" is disappearing in the South. Tiiebaw is a great warrior—on paper, The English soon finished him up, when it came to actual operations. Not a more pleasant place to spend an evening can be found in Montana than the Butte Grand Opera House. To-day and Monday mark the limit for the payment of city taxes. After Monday the penalty will be added. Pay up. Heavy engines and heavily-laden cars are straining the light rails on the Utah and Northern. The cold weather is telling on them. A prospectus of The Miner's New Year number will be issued in a few days. This special edition will not be issued until New Year's day. Do not be deceived into buying a cheap oroide watch at a snide auction show for a genuine article. Steer clear of snide jew elry shops. The police seem to have awakened to the fact that bunco men have been working the town. Seems to have been an after election arousal. The biggest bunco joint in the city is a snide jewelry shop on Main street, near Broadway. The place deserves the atten tion of the police. The sulphur fumes were something fright ful last night. A fortune awaits the man who will invent a process by which these fumes may be consumed. If the comets could go a-starring the country would be flooded with new stellar attractions. The discovery of new comets has been so great this season. Judging from the length and force of his recent letter, we should say that the Hon. Samuel J. Tilden is in very robust health. He may yet write an inaugural address. Logan's book will probably sell so that it will leave its author in comfortable cir cumstances. Without reference to politics, the old "boys in blue" will all hope so. Frequently it is rum-monia, instead of pneumonia. No single cause iB so pro ductive of pneumonia in high climates as the excessive use of liquor. Shut her down, boys. The New Yeah Miner will reach every portion of the civilized world. This is as sured by the orders which we have already received. It will be an invaluable adver tising medium. They have lively campaigns outside of Montana. Mr. Callan has called Mr. Par nell "a deliberate liar, slanderer and cow ard." The later Mountain should employ Mr. Callan as political editor. Doubting Thomases still shake their heads, but The Miner continues to grow. It is quite prosperous and appears regu larly every day of the year, for Butte, He lena and the whole Territory. The great West is deeply interested in anything that will improve our great water ways. Water transportation is infinitely cheaper and better than any other. The Miner trusts that the Territory will be represented in the Kansas City Convention. The Commissioners of Missoula county have awarded their county printing to an Eastern firm. They could, undoubtedly, have the work done as cheaply and as well m the Territory. The Miner is ready to duplicate any prices that any outside house may give, acting in good faith. We understand that the members of the Grand Army resident in Butte wi'l soon organize a corps of the Sons of Veterans, an auxiliary organization composed of the sons of ex-soldiers of the Union. The object of the Order is to instill into the minds of the young a love of country and of the flag. The demise of Captain Jesse Archer, of Florida, is announced, in consequence of a hand-to-mouth encounter for a wager with a quart of whisky. Captain Archer was an old sea-dog, and his death demonstrates anew that there is always more or less danger, to somebody, in betting on the tankage of a tar. One who knows the great Nihilist, and who has studied her characteristics, writes of Louise Michel as follows: "Louise Michel's is not a well balanced mind. She is a woman who has suffered much. She has seen years of want and misery. She has often gone hungry, and hard knocks have made her exalted in many things. She has a strong Will, but is weak in spirit. She is easily controlled, easily influenced, and will go to all extremes when roused under influences, be it good or bad." is They have great statesmen in New Hamp shire. Last winter they adopted a law compelling, under heavy penalties, the butterine and oleomargarine manufactur ers to give their product a pink color. The law is being enforced, the courts holding that as the manufacturers of bogus butter color 'their wares, they might as well make it pink as yellow, and that the peo ple are entitled to such protection against the fraud. The sellers of oleomargarine in Butte evidently do not buy in New Hamp shire. That was an amusing sight which pre sented itself at the corner of Main and Granite streets, last evening. A party of street exhorters, working in the interest of some local religious revival, by theirspeak ing and singing, collected quite a number of people. The crowd consisted of all classes of our people, and here and there were vis ible the sensational and glaring banners of the Arion and the Comique. The carriers of these banners took advantage of the re ligious gathering to advertise the stellar at tractions of the Vaudevilles. It was a sight and a gathering that one can find only in a live Western mining camp. Beecher, says the San Francisco Chron icle, fairly represents the sentimentalists who think the Chinese are eager to accept the Christian religion and morality. He thinks the average Christian dislikes the heathen because he smells bad. When Beecher was out here he refused to study the Chinese question—refused even to offend his nostrils by a trip through China town. He preferred theory to facts. No one ever heard of Beecher makiDg any sacrifices for his religion or stinting any of his luxurious tastes. He is an aristocrat at heart, and has no sympathy with the workingman or with the Chinese. He champions the cause of the cooli e^ becau se it is a good way to create TtowJTÎetyTâk'ÂÇJ utterance of. his bn tbe subject is sure t&, be quoted. a is as iar as and busi it.' the it an the for cars a to a The Executive Committee called into be ing by the action of the delegates to the water ways convention at St. Paul, in August last, have issued a call for a con vention for Missouri River Improvement, to be held at Kansas City on the 29th inst. In their call the Committee makes the following statement: From the facts disclosed by the experimental fleet of 1878, and from a knowledge of the Mis souri and Mississippi rivers, P> derived from a long experience with them, Captain Lowery, who had charge of the Babbage Company's fleet in 1878, arrived at the conclusion that with adequate im provement of these rivers, grain can be carried from Kansas City to New Orleans at a freight charge of seven cents per bushel. It is believed that a corresponding rate from all other Missouri river points and three cents added for the higher coat of ocean freightage to foreign markets from New Orleans than from Atlantic ports, would not exceed twelve cents per bushel, making the grain available for export from New Orleans at the same charge as from Atlantic ports. The current rail rates for years past from Mis souri river points to Atlantic ports has not been less than twenty-one cents on wheat and sixteen cents on corn—a difference of four cents on corn and nine cents on wheat in favor of the river route. The price of grain in the Missouri Valley is the price in foreign markets less the cost of placing it there. The price in foreign markets is fixed by the supply from countries other than our own, hence this saving, if realized as it may be by the improvement of our rivers, will inure to the producers in the Missouri Valley, and will apply to the entire product of our farms, as well as to that part exported. The product of the Missouri Valley in the cen sus year 1879, the last for which we have accurate statistics, was 61,116,877 bushels of wheat and «4,849,526 bushels of corn. These crops at four and nine cents, respectively, gives a total sum of 822,074,456, which river transportation would save to the producers of the Missouri Valley, on each crop like that of 1879. We have to consider, however, not alone the benefits that may be secured, but the dangers that may be averted. The high cost of transpor tation in this country, maintaining as it does the high cost of American grain in foreign markets, and the reduced cost of transportation from grain producing countries in Asia incident to the open ing of the Suez canal, reducing as it docs the cost of grain from those countries delivered in the same markets, has so stimulated their product that they threaten soon to drive American grain from all markets accessible to both, and so re duce the profit of its production in the Missouri Valley as to depress our agricultural industries and compel the adoption o f other products. The contrast between American grain and that of other countries for primacy in the world's mar kets is now reduced to a matter of transportation. The advantages are now against us, but the im provement of our water-ways will turn this permanently in our favor. These facts now pre sent a dangerous and threatening situation, and the improvement of our river, as a means of promoting cheaper transportation for our grain than railroads can ever afford, is demnnded, not merely as a means for securing great benefits,but likewise as a means of averting great disasters. And it is in the interest of securing benefits and averting disasters that this appeal to you is made. The practicability of the improvement of our river is no longer a matter of doubt. The suc cess of the jetties and other improvements on the Mississippi river is well and generally known. Ex periments on the Missouri river, both by private and corporate enterprise and by government ap propriations, has demonstrated that this stream also can be easily and cheaply improved. After careful survey and adequate study of the river, Major Charles R. 8uter, then engineer of the United States army and member of the Mis sissippi River Commission, now president of the Missouri River Commission, reported to Congress in 1881 that an expenditure of 810,000 per mile would secure a permanent channel of twelve feet depth at low water and of sufficient width for purposes of navigation. This sum does not ex ceed half the cost of a single track railroad, and will present transportation facilities equal to all the railroads in the valley combined. With such advantages to gain and such threat ened disasters to avert at so small a cost, this committee believes that every resident of the Missouri Valley should cordially unite in efforts to secure the improvement of our river. A uni ted sentiment among the people will secure a united effort by our Senators and representatives in Congress, and a united effort on their part,, as has been demonstrated in other matters, will secure success in obtaining all reasonable ap propriations, and the early completion of this great and beneficent work. To further the object aimed at this Convention has been called. Senators, Governors of States and Territories, and other distinguished citizens will be invited to attend. In order that the Convention may be a large and representative one, the following basis of representation has been agreed upon: Commercial bodies of 500 members or less, ten delegates; commercial bodies, each additional 500 members or less, five delegates; cities, towns, townships and counties having no commercial organiza tion, for 5,000 population or less, five del egates, for each additional 5,000 popula tion, two delegates. The call is signed, on behalf of Montana, by T. Ç. Power, of Helena. It is rumored, (and it comes from a pretty reliable source, that the Union Pa cific and the Northern Pacific companies are now perfecting an arrangement whereby the Northern Pacific is to secure control of that portion of the Utah & Northern Railway between Silver Bow and Garrison, including the Anaconda Branch. It is believed that the Union Pacific is wil ling to sell this part of its line outright, and not make it contingent on traffic or pool compacts. When the Northern Pacific se cures control of it, so goes the rumor, they will at once make a standard gauge road of it, and the Union Pacific will, in all probability, lay a third rail be tween Silver Bow and Butte. This would give the great camp an unbrokeu standard gauge route to Portland and St. Paul. The story is given here for what it is worth. We have no doubt that the Union Pacific is quite willing to part with this section of its road, and that it would dispose of it for a less sum than it would cost the Northern Pacific to build a new line. A sure road to long life, according to an English saying, is to get an a pension list. We may well believe this to 1» true, since the report of the Pension Bureau shows that there are 78,500 soldiers of the war of 1812 and their widows on the pension list, a number that is believed to exceed by far the numbers that saw cannon smoke on land in that memorable war. At the same rate of vitality seventy-live years from now there should be at least 100,000 pensioners surviving out of the nearly 600,000 persons who have already received $744,000,000 from the Government since 1861. Every year the pension report comes in for more or less abuse on the part of certain persons and papers; but, as time goes by, the wil lingness to grant pensions ought to increase rather than decrease, since there can be no nobler way to spend the public money than on the public defenders. May they live long, too, in peace and plenty, surrounded by their children and their grand-children, with the grand and beautiful old flag gaily flying o'er them, for many, many years beyond the time allotted to man. General Manager Kimball, of the Union Pacific Railway Company, and party, left for the East, yesterday. Mr. Kimball has thoroughly investigated the sail question and studied its bearings upon the future posperity of the camp. He came to no decision while here, but undoubtedly will make a decision soon after his return to Omaha. He can make ho change in the rate without the assent of the Northern Pacific Railroad, which has not yet been given. _ The verdict of a Reading, Pennsylvania, jury, in a breach of promise case, shows that the value of a Pennsylvania girl as steady company is about $4 a week. This is dirt cheap. Our Helena correspondence is attracting considerable attention. It will improve as our correspondent becomes more famil iar with his field of labor.

LESSONS OF THE ELECTION. All elections, whether great or small by their results teach lessons which would be well for parties as well as indi viduals to study and profit by. An elec tion for members of Parliament in Great Britain signifies the peoples' approbation or disapproval of the policy laid down by 1 the Ministry which represents the English Government, and so also at national con ! tests in America for President or members J of Congress may be justly regarded, figur atively speaking,as a barometrical reflex the public sentiment of a majority of the citizens. For this reason it may be safely contended that the memorable campaign of last year demonstrated an indubitable disapprobation of the course pursued by the Republican party in flagrantly disrc garding the high and important trusts which had been confided to its keeping for almost a quarter of a century. Municipal contests at the polls unmis takeably manifest the opinion of taxpayers in favor or against the management of city affairs. Last Spring the Republicans elected six members of the Council, the Police Judge, Marshal and City Attorney, and the Democrats two Aldermen, a Mayor and City Treasurer. Wednesday last, at the special election, the Democrats secured the City Attorney and one member of the Council, the only officers voted for, by decided majority, considering the light vote polled. This result cannot fairly be re garded in any other light than that of ie pudiating the action of the majority of the Council, and the manner of enforcing the police regulations of the city. Complaints against the latter have been so frequent as to convince the most disinterested that the system is radically wrong, and that the welfare and prosperity of the city, as well ns the security and happiness of the people, demanded immediate reform. These police regulations, of which the people complain, have gradually grown into our municipal system, because no determ ined effort was wade prior to the special election to publicly condemn them. Ordi nances have been prepared and approved by council having no other object in view than that of increasing the fees which would naturally flow into the hands and pockets of those officers, whose duty it was to en force them. These ordinances include, with but few exceptions, the catalogue of crimes punishable under the Territorial laws. Some members of the bar, after examining them, have expressed their wonder that the offenses contained in the Federal laws were not enumerated among those attempted to be made cognizable before the Police Judge. The District Court has frequently decided that these ordinances are null and void, and in spite of those adjudica tions by that tribunal, the inferior court has persisted in enforcing them, by daily impositions of fines, impris onment and costs. The fines imposed un der the ordinances are insignificant, hence not. calculated to intimidate evil-doers, but the costs are tremendous, running all the way from $20 to $50, depending upon the number of w'tnesses summoned to tes tify on the part of the prosecution. I Aider this unparalleled system of police justice(?) defendants' witnesses, who, in obedience to the court, are compelled to leave their busi ness or work, must do so without any com pensation, and so must those at.swct ing a subpuma issued by the prosecution, unless the defendant is adjudged guilty and has money enough to pay the costs. Witness fees assessed as costs, and paid, form a very considerable item in the perquisites pertaining to all inferior judicatures, be cause they are very seldom called for by those entitled to them. The prosecution is not held responsible in any court for the defendants' witness fees, but it is so held in all other courts, except our police tribunals, for those testi fying in its behalf. The city is liable for its witnesses' fees, and council ought to make provision to pay them. Fines for violat ing city ordinances ought to rule and not fees. City Council should at once repeal all ordinances which, under the charter and laws, it lias no authority to enact, and pay its officers salaries for their services, or reasonable fees in all cases, whether there are convictions or not. By this means only can an officer faithfully and impartially discharge his duties, for then liis judgment will not lie biased by the hope of pecuniary gain off or the mis fortunes of culprits who are adjudged guilty. Abolish all fees in the Police Court and impose fines upon the guilty ones. This will prove the better plan. The Husbandman wants to know "What has become of the twenty-one millions of money estimated to have been taken from the mines of Montana during the past twelve months? Is it still a factor of our wealth, or has it been shipped from our Territory, to be returned no more?" This is in the way of an argument by the farm ers against mining. The Maiden Argus com ments upon it as follows : "Some of it has no doubt. Yet a considerable portion of it has gone towards building up the magnifi cent cities of Butte aud Helena. In the former place over four thousand men arc employed, whose wages amount to $400,000 per month. If foreign capitalists had not invested in our mines Montana would not contain over ten thousand souls to day. The indirect benefit resulting from the expenditure of money in opening our mines, and the cost of operation is a thousand times greater than the dividends carried away by non-residents. Helena and Butte, with cheap transportation facilities, may yet furnish a market for the ranch products of the greater portion of Mon tana. There are several districts just now in need of the aid of foreign capital. God hasten the day for it to come." The Miner has it from a semi-official source that the Union Pacific company has everything in readiness to go on with the construction of their line into Helena and Bozeman, and probably into Benton. No movement will, it is understood, be made until the Northern Pa cific makes an aggressive movement toward Butte. It is said that this is no "bluff," but that the Union Pacific has actually raised the money necessary for tbe con struction of these routes. The Union Pa cific is of opinion that the traffic of Mon tana alone will make a line centering at Butte profitable. If the new line is built Butte will become the headquarters of a divisiou, where a large number of men will be employed. There cannot be too much railroad building in Montana next year so far as the people of Butte are concerned. Says an exchange: "A member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen wishes to know if tbe Life Assurance scheme of that order should not be amended so that suicides shall not be entitled to the bene fits of an insurance policy? He says: 'Does the plan as it now stands, not offer a reward for selfmurder?' " The Life Assur ance scheme of this excellent ord~r has worked so admirably in the past that changes should not be lightly made. The better class of old stock insurance com panies are now changing their policies in respect to suicides and where they do not, and contest the payment of policies on suicides, juries invariably decide against them. The Ancient Order of United Work men are careful in taking in members. They throw about the initiate every safe guard that medical skill and experience dictate. Their losses from this source are very small, and there should be no change. The Miner will hereafter have a daily news letter from Helena, having established a regular agency in that city. All the news will be given in these letters, without fear or favor. There will be no suppression to please any clique or class. People who want all the news of tbe Territory should subscribe for Tbe Mines. it of a | That's who Baldwin is! No more politics until 1888. The pa; meat of hat bets is in order. Protect your water and gas-pipes. The people rule: the "ring" has been sat down upon. The East is protesting against the kissing clergyman. Tbe cold weather has materially im proved business. Mb. Baldwin carried three of the wards of the citj. four Mr. Baldwin will redeem every promise made in his behalf. We are as thankful as our readers that the election iB over. The President's message must have been a dampener on tbe Mormons. The merry jingle of the sleigh bells war beard in the air last night. The Miner may now be had in every city, village and hamlet in the Territory. Dr. Beal had a walk-over. He will make a hard-working and energetic Alderman. The Christmas tree is on the way and the little folk are dreaming of Santa Claus. The cold weather will improve business. The snow fall has cheered our business Vanderbilt died of brain trouble. The millionaire has his brain troubles just like the poorest hod-carrier. Dagger unquestionably threatens Salt Lake. A spark would be sufficient to start a dangerous conflagration. "Promises to pay" after election arc un limited due bills, as many a deluded mortal will realize to his sorrow to-day. "W The Miner's New Year number wilfhave a wider circulation than any other publi cation on Montana ever issued. It is a noticeable fact that since the elec tric lights have come into use to light the city there have been no holds-up. Every sure-thing man voted and worked for Hamilton. How does our great relig ious contemporary explain this fact? The Miner and the Helena Independent are the only two papers that published the President's Message without mutilation. The Miner's new year number is now in the hands of the orinters. It will be one of the most interesting books on Montana ever issued. The Grand Army boys had a delightful time, last evening, at their ball. It was one of the most enjoyable affa irs ever given in the city. If it had been a clear and pleasant day, Mr. Baldwin's majority would have been greater. Thirty-nine will, however, do—on a cold, stormy day. The Inter Mountain was badly scooped yesterday. Indeed, it appears to navi been an exceedingly frigid day for our even ing contemporary. The men who are breaking away from Mr. Parnell are not true friends of Ireland The cause of Ireland and of the Irish can best be served by united action. Prince Alexander has declined King Milan's offers of peace. Alexander is evi dently reaching after that bauble, a crown His ambition may prove his ruin. The Mormons are beginning to show some regard for public opinion. They are wincing under the lash of public sentiment and there is some hope in this. It was a Democratic victory, that of yes terday, but it was achieved by the people irrespective of party bias. It was a vie tory for reform in municipal affairs. The disgraceful personal abuse of Mr Baldwin by the Inter Mountain made that gentleman many votes among the respecta ble element of the Republican party. The English election returns are about as complicated as those of America usually are. The indications are that the Tories and Parnellites, united, will hold the con trol of Parliament. If all the Republicans who declined to vote "the ring's" ticket are "traitors," then this "neck of the woods" is full of them. The alleged "traitors" seemed to be in quite robust health, last evening. The escape of the three prisoners from the county jail appears to be the result of the most culpable negligence. There ap pear to be no excuses for the escape and the matter should be officially investigated. Here we are in midwinter and yet the reports come that the cholera scourge has become epidemic in Brittany. The Presi dent's reference to the necessity of prompt action as a Nation against the introduction of this terrible disease into this country. The action of the Commissioners in es tablishing electric lights between Butte and Walkerville and between Butte and South Butte gives universal satisfaction. The Commissioners have done no public act re cently that has given such unqualified sat isfaction. Mr. Baldwin's majority is not so large as we could wish it, but there is one consola tion about it, not a solitary sure thing m an, thief, thug or bunco man voted for him. He owes his election very largely to the respectable element of the Republican party, who voted for him almost without exception. The opera season is a very successful one. The company, the costumes, the stage-setting, the orchestra, indeed, every thing connected with the production, are all that can be desired. The operas are being produced in excellent style and the audiences are delighted. The New York Board of Trade yesterday took a hand at giving silver a black eye. It is beginning to look as though silver hadn't a solitary friend. If the silver pro ducers will not organize to protect their own interests it cannot be expected that any one else will champion their cause. Senator Dolph, of Oregon, has already introduced a new land law bill, which seems to be very sweeping in its character. The very brief and unsatisfactory condensation of the bill which the wires have brought us, published elsewhere, does not indicate that it is a bill that will find much favor in Montana. An English lady, secretary of the anti vivisection league, writes to M. Pasteur that she has escaped hydrophobia five or six times, by cauterization of the wound, and offers to submit herself to be bitten by any pnintal in Mr. Pasteur's labratory to prove that she can ward off the malady. The strong faith of the young lady should b* >4 to the test. / THE 

PRESIDENTS' MESSAGE. The first message of President Cleveland to Congress was submitted to that body yesterday, and is this morning laid before our readers in full. It is just such a docu ment as was to be expected from so care ful, studious and conservative a man as Mr. Cleveland. It is an able, diguitied and statesmanlike paper, and bears the im press of honest thought. While it is some respects disappointing to the people of the West, it will be closely read. It the one great item of news of the day, and we offer no apologies for the space given up to it in this special edition. The President pays a deserved and fei ing tribute-to the late Thomas A. Hend ricks, and then briefly adverts to the com ity of relations that should exist between Congress and the Executive and defines the duties and powers of each. Our foreign relations are spoken of great length and prominence is given to the South and Central American states. The ship railway across the Isthmus, proposed by Eads, receives a black-eye. The Ameri can hog is defended and tbe Santos case re ceives considerable prominence. The subject of naturalization is treated of at length, and in no uncertain manner. There is a true American ring about this portion of the message that will find hearty response in the heart of every true patriot. and the course defended. In th ol doctrine is held that "the United . must hold in their intercourse ileges allowed to them without regard to creed." Austria's right to decline receiving Mr. Keilley solely on religious grounds denied. The President speaks in no uncertain tones upon the Mormon question. He insists that polygamy must go, and that the present laws are not ample to aceom plish this, others more stringent should be enacted. Our relations with England are specialty referred to, the question of a new extradi tion treaty with that power is raised and an International copyright bill, upon the basis of the Berne conference, is recom mended. Closer relations with Mexico are suggested. Much space is given to the public debt and to the excessive revenues of the Gov ernment. The tariff bugbear is cleverly avoided. Protection of American indus tries is advocated and a reduction of duties on the necessaries of life recommended, The Chinese question is not viewed from a popular, but froma statesmanlike stand point. The discharge of onr treaty obliga tions and the maintenance of law and order are insisted upon. He boldly takes the position that we can, as a Nation, Oar out from our shores objectionable imini gration, and says that if the existing re striction act is not satisfactory that anew and more stringent one should be enacl ed The one subject to which the greatest amount of attention is given and with which the people of the West will take issue is the further coinage of silver. The Pros! dent makes an elaborate and exhaustive argument against silver, and this part of his message will bring general disap pointment to the people of the Rocky Mountains. The message very clear and explicit upon this point and the reader is referred to it. The Pres ident's mind upon this subject has been biased by bad counsellors. We have, this morning, neither the time nor the space to review the message fully, but shall recur to the subject at some future time. While there are some things about the message that are disappointing to us there are many that are to be applauded and ad mired. It is, as we have already said, an able paper, characterized by a broad and cultured statesmanship and reflects credit upon the author and the Nation. Touching the extortionate freight rate on salt, in which we are so deeply interested and which Messrs. Kimball and Shelby come here to inquire into, the Walkerville News of to-morrow will have the following to say editorially: It would seem that a reduction in the freight of milling salt by the Utah & Northern is not yet an accomplished fact. The railroad authorities appear loth to reduce their revenue in this par ticular, and the mining companies are equally determined to submit to what they consider an extortion no longer. It is threatened, and we speak advisedly when we say that it is no idle threat, to suspend mining and milling opera tions after January 1st, unless a satisfactory arrangement is made with the railroad company in the matter of a salt tariff. Already the Lex ington Company has reduced its working force almost one-half; the Alice Company are prepar ing to make a sweeping reduction in the list of its employes, and so with the Moulton and all other mines in this vicinity. The reason given is the enormous expense of working the ore, prin cipally entailed by the excessive cost of milling salts. The mining people are satisfied that with a competing railroad the rates must be lowered materially, and knowing the ore they have in sight will keep, intend to suspend operations until they can work It to their advantage. This stoppage of work in the mines will throw about 1,000 men out- of employment on this side of the hill alone; it will cause a complete stagnation in all kinds of business and will greatly retard the growth of the camp. Three months of idle ness in the mines means the ruination of many now doing a prosperous business. This is the outlook at present, and it is earnestly hoped that Messrs. Kimball and Shelby will Indorse the sentiments of Assistant-General Superintendent Dickinson in this matter, and conclude to report in fuvor of a reduction in the freight rates on milling salts. It seems poor policy on the part of the company, for a temporary gain, to effectually force on absolute suspension of the very Indus try from which they derive so much revenue. This expresses the sentiment of the com munity. The mill managers have definitely determined no longer to exhaust the mines, without some prospect of decent returns We trust that Messrs. Kimball and Shelby will stay long enough in the camp to thor oughly familiarize themselves with the sub ject to the end that they may be able to act intelligently in the premises. v 

SOME FACTS 017 COINAGE. The production of gold in the entire world for the year 1884, says the Director of United States mints, amounted to $95, 000,000, and in silver, at its coinage value, $45,000,000. This shows' au increase in gold over the preceding year of $1,000,000 and a decrease of silver during the same time of about an equal amount. * * * So far as advices have been received, coinages were executed during the calendar year 1884, in eighteen countries of the world, amounting in round numbers to $99,500,000 in gold and $90,000.000 in silver. As heretofore the United States lias been the largest coiner of both metals. The coinage of gold by Australia was only $1,800,000 less than that of the United States.

The sudden and unexpected death of William H. Vanderbilt, America's richest citizen, will cause a severe shock to the commercial world. He has been in en feebled health for some time and it is be lieved had virtually withdrawn from the stock market and had his affairs in shape for dissolutiou. However, no man pos sessing such vast interests can be called from the earth without causing serious complications. Mr. McHatton, who has been acting City Attorney since the sad death ofH.B.Smith, is a young man of promise. He has filled the office most acceptably and to the en tire satisfaction of the Mayor and Aider men. He has, in the discharge of his du ties, shown superior talents and enhanced his reputation as a lawyer and a skilful business man. He will be heard from in the future. It looks as though Congress intended to look into the right of Austria-Hungary to refuse to receive Mr. Keily as our Minister resident at Vienna. This is right. If Aus tria has snubbed this country we Bhould know it, to the end that we may sever di plomatic relations with that power. We would lose nothing by such a course and would save a not inconsiderable sum of money. _ The surplus revenues of the country should be put into ships ol war and coast defenses. Fifty millions thus expended an nually for four or five years would revive every drooping interest in the country and put us in position to make American cit-I zenship respected the world over. This is an opinion by the New York Sun "The Republicans will search the Senate in vain for a presiding officer whose health gives better promise of a longer life than President Cleveland seems likely to enjoy It is to be hoped that the Sun's predictions may be verified. 'School Whispers" is the title of a new monthly publication that has made its ap pearance in Butte. It is published and edited by A. C. Newill, of the Butte High School. It will be devoted to the interests of the public schools. Success to it. The ignorant druggist, who doesn't know quinine from morphia, has got his work in on the human family in Indiana He has poisoned a whole household. "Mur der as a Fine Art" should be discussed at the next druggists' convention. It is reported from Baltimore that Rev Aschenfelter tried "the kiss of the Lord" on the pretty girls of his congregation of that city. The kiss of Judas would be prefera ble to these clerical tendernesses. Since the civil war Richmond, Virginia, has had no paper worthy the name of newspaper. The IfTiig lias just been sold and a reform is promised. Meaderville and the entire camp are to be congratulated on the narrow escape of the Montana Colusa mine from a serious conflagration, yesterday. We desire to repeat the prediction, that no man who places himself upon record as opposed to silver will ever be President of the United States. Changes in the Helena Independent are once more talked of. A number of persons are named as probable managers. The opera season is so successful that it should suggest the idea of making it a per manent feature of the camp. Sleighing parties are already being or ganized and the young folks are looking forward to a jolty season. May there be no holes in the bottoms of the Christmas stockings of any readers of The Miner. The holiday Miner will have an immense circulation. Advertisers should bear this fact in mind. The bunco men all opposed Mr. Baldwin This is greatly to the credit of the success' ful candidate.
