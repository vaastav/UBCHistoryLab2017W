I desire to offer a couple of reso lutions bearinz upon this subject one ef them particularly; but I do net ex pect to make tbe Senate nnderttand the state of feelice existing oa the border. I bare a rreat number of letters from gentlemen living on tbe border. In my own city, wbicb is within musket rane of the Canadian shore, thousands of citizens have been underarms fjr a long time. We have been in a continual state of alarm, from incendiaries, btr glare and robbers. rrom this announcement it would seem tbat tba Canadian authorities have made np tbeir minds to protect these robbers. As I understand it, a man comes from the South with a commis sion purporting: to be issued br Jeff Davis, lie enlists bis robbing par lies, crosses the border, murders. and robs whom he pleases, and return 1 to Canada, where he is prelected. These letters which I have in my possesaiou ' are ail bearing spun tbia point. The one in my hand now is from one of the most respectable cilixens of Detroit, a jrentiemaa af great wealth, of bigh poli tical and social position, wbo earnestly desires to avoid any difficulty with Great Britain at tbis time.

Johnson I object to tbe resolution The President, pro tem The resolu tion will lie over, objections being made. Chandler I bad hoped there would be no objection to it I will now offer another resolution which I ask to be re ferred to the Committee on Commerce. The resolution was read and is as fol lows Whereas, At the commencement of tbe present rebellion tbe United States were at peace witb all tbe Uovernments of all tbe world, and oa terms of amnity and gnod will with Great Britain: aud ft BtatAi. that nation before tbe ar rival of our Minister on her soil accred ited to tbe administration of President Lincoln, precipitately acknowledged the rebels as beligerents, thus recognising their fisg npon tbe ocean, without which recognition it would have been regarded at piratical by all other powers; and WHEBtAt.

I bar no objection to the reference of tba reso lution, but will stale that the Committee finance have already this tubieet uder consideration, at recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury in his nnual report and by the President of tbe United States in hit annual message. II tbe points at issue wi!l be cocsidur I by the Committee without anv reso lution on the subiect Mieruian explained further, that while was well eaough for Senators to ex- rets anxiety oa tbe sabject, all bills to revenue intit orieiaete in the House of ItepresenUlivea The Senate stould remember that at the last session psseed resolutions for a special in me tax. aad the House sent it back, on the ground that all such measures shosld ongtnsie in the House. Lie thought tbat this resolution would create a controvtrsy with the House which be desired to avoid. The Seaate must await tbeir action. Be believed there was a necessity for increased taxation. There were teveral reasons for it The soldiers were bow terving in the field and enduring the hardships of mili tary service while citixene were reaping rit-a probtt from tbe war, by engaging ia bueintta, and were doing belter than thej bad done during any previous year. lis thought it waa but right that they who ar reaping the profits of the war should pay liberally in tax. If we in creased our national debt aad put these tares upon future generations, we com pelled these soldiers, who bad fought our battles, to bear tbe expenses of tbe w-r. This would be unjust Brown. I bave no objections lo tbe reference of this rssolultoo lo tbe Com mittee on Finance, if it waa introduced simply for se-uing forth the viewa enter tained by ibe Senator from Wtecoasia (Mr. DooUtt't), of indicating lis direc tion in wb.cb be thought inquiry should be male, btt if it is going to that com mittee by general consent, aad is to be taken at tny ingestion that tbe Stoate coocart in the taggeetioat made, 1 shonid, for one, say that 1 differ very widely ia regard to the policies be bas indicated, and tbe erTrcu to follow from tbat which be seems la anticipate I iU add but one word more, and say (bit tbat I tbiak gentlemen are pr bapt mistaken in regard to live extent to which Uxatioo can be carried, an 1 tbat we art perhapt nearer to tbe point to wbich it can properly be borne than persons imagine. Mr Brown continued hit remarks, ad rocetirig a reduction ef expenditures ia the romiuct of tbe Government Ma lWtf.U -I sgrea with tba Sena tor from Missouri entirely in wbat be tart about tbe necessity of reducing ex penses in every possible way. I will go with him in every effort to reduce them, and to compel the Administration, In every department of the Goverament, to eiercise) (be strictest economy possible. Al the same time, our necessary expen ses are so great, and net I be to great. Ibat we are compelled to teiit Bold of every source that will bring ut revenue. I do not expect, of aoarse, that these reasons shall go forth at expressing tbe views of the Seaate upon tba points I bare presented, still the points are of sufficient interest and importance to be well considered by tbat committee. Tbe resolution was then referred, without objection. Chandler moved tbat tbe resolutions offered by him to dsy be printed, wbich was earned. Brown offered tbe following, wbich wal adopted: icetoitea, mat tne committee on Military Affairs and the military be in strncted to inquire into lis expediency of repeating an act of Congress of March 21st, 1S61, entitled aa "Act to remove the Arsenal Irora the city of St Louia, aad to provide for tbe sale of the land on which it is located. Doolittle moved that all bills, petitient and memorials wbich were pending at the close of the last seamen ot Congress be referred to their appropriate Com mittee i. This was carriea'. . A joint resolutioa from tie House was announced giving notice to Great Britain of the termination of tbe Reci procity Treaty. Foster moved to refer it the Commit tee on Commerce. Sumner thought it ought to go to tbe Committee on foreign delations, and it was oo motion, so referred. Tbe Senate went into exentivt session and soon after adjourned. Hocse. WUsoo, of Iowa, from tbe Committee oa Judiciary, renorted a bill amendatory of an act of July 17th, 1362, to define pay and ercoiamenls of officers of the Army, so as to read: Tbat any alien of 21 years and - upwards, wbo shall have enlisted in the Volunteer or Regular Army ' or Navy, or Marine Corps and baa beta honorably discharged, may become citixeat withoot any person's declaration, aad shall not be required to prove more thaa one jear's reaidence.
