After nn elaborate exposition of the features of I the bill and the method of their operation which j followed the line of his report on the mensure. : heretofore printed. Mr OveeotTOet said: The proposition to allow National banks to Issue circulation to the par value of the bonds deposited for their securltv I- neither new nor parttsun. It has been recommended bv four Presidents and five Secretaries of the Treasury, and bills containing such provision have heen introduced in t'ongress and supported bv members of both political parties. It I? entirely consistent with the present banking system The same reasons which Justify the Issue of 90 per cent of the bonds will Justify an Issue to ?he pur value of the bonds The only objection ad? vanced aside from lbat of demagogic attack, gen? erally, upon banks. Is that It permits too large an Increase of the volume of circulation, and lili? an Inflation. Rat it Is unfair to compare the amnun? possible under the proposed bill with the amount of banknote now in circulation. The lack of profit upon ba-iknote circulation because of the tax has reduced such circulation far below the amount ever expected, and such reduction can be creditably charged t.. a contraction Which til equally unexpected. The proper comparison ia Be? tween the am 'ant -possible under the present law snd the amount possible under the proposed amend? ment, whi, h would be but a M per cenl Increase. an amount ?lu h can be easily absorbed by the buslo-ss of the country, and utilized In as mai ferent m.y centt Th.- r. p< ii of t N I ?111j ,;, . upon bank fran tal, surplus and undi rtded prol - osed In a spirit <>f fairness ano for a lui ' of the tax.

MADDOX IN OPPOSITION Mr afaddoa (Desa , Ga) waa the first speaker tn lion to the bill. He said that If he had anal? ysed the lill eorrectty no measure had been pre? sented to Congress in half a century fraught With so mu.h Importance to the country. He referred to ex-Speaker Heed's rfeW-Tork speech, tn which he advised the immediate enactment of gold stand? ard legislation before some branch of the Govern? ment got away from the Republican party. "The faithful," said he. "understand that this legislation must le enacted at once or not at all " Mr. Maddox then proceeded with a detailed an? alysis of the bill. The enactment of gold standard legislation, he declared, had never been an issue heforo the people. If gold was now the "existing Standard," as was contended, It was so by the un? lawful usurpation of tho executive offices of the Government. Facility for raiding the Treasury under the bill, he said, had never bfor hitherto equalled. It would convert every obligation of the Treasury Into a gold obligation, and would compel the Government to sell millions of gold to the amount of 25 p*r cent of ni! the outstanding notes of whatever character. He argued that under the bill banks with 11.000.000 capital, now required to deposit bonds equal to a third of their capital In the Treasury, were only required to deposit $00,000 in bonds, enabling the banks, he declared, to con? tract or expand the enrrentry nt will. Ho took up the Republican platform of ii?6 to show that ev, ry R.-publlcan who now advocated the rold standard was un ap?rtate. He had read at the clerk's desk the speech* s of some of the Republican leaders In 1SS7 declaring that the Republicans wero for In? ternational bimetallism. The speeches, he declared. were made In support of the bill for the creation ' of the Commission whl.-h wer? ar>snad in the in? terest of international bimetallism, by Messrs Hep- ' burn. Dingley and Grosvenor. Mr. Maddox summed I up his argument by declaring the meature to be a ! Mil designed to legallxe the authority usurped by the Secretary of the Treasury to put the countr ' on a gold baals. to demonetize half the final money of redemption, to alter the obligations of the people without their consent Into gold obligations, to contract the currency at the will of the banka, and to create a gigantic bank trust for the benefit of a few thousand people. MR DOLLIVER SPEAKS FOR THF BILL. At the close of Mr. Madden s remarks Mr. Dolll ver (Rep . Iowa) took the floor. In opening he poked fun at the Democratic leaders for asking an additional period for incubating speeches on the gold and silver question. There was a time, he said, when he had figures and authorities on the financial question at his finger tips. Now he was called upon to speak with most of his figures at home and his authorities out of reach. Still, he recognised the fact that at this stage of the con? troversy to hold on to one's figures meant to lose one's nudlence. (I.augl ter and applause.) Proceeding, Mr. Dolllvcr read from a speech of ex-Governor Altgeld to the effect that the Repub? lican t'ongress would obey orders and enact gold atandard legislation. For atassolt, he said, be was proud to say that he was obeying orders-the or? ders of the people of his district-trying to put the laws of the country Into harmony with their opinions. The pending bill was a compromise rep? resenting the united wisdom of all. "There Is something about the pursuit of the science of money." said he. "that enables avery one of its students to comprehend his own ideas without be? ing very hospitable toward the Ideas of others." ?Laughter ) This wag a bill to set at rest n\\ doubt as to the standard In this country, it should be presented to th' business men of the country as a Christmas g.ft. Mr. Dolhver said he did not want his record of past follies to be brought up against him. He had voted for the 8h< mian act In 1890-an act which he now regarded as a piece of unutter? able stupidity. In 1893. when the act came to be repeal?-.!. Mr. PatMver said, he was mu. h perplexed. He saw Senator Sh-rman one evening sitting out? side his house, like Abraham outside his tent. "Don't trouble yourself about the failure of your &m There's a greater demand made on the strength of the mother when nursing than at any other time.

"that the mints should be opened to silver If an International agreement could be ob? tained"'' ''N'... sir." replied Mr. Dolllver; "I have had my last whirl with stiver.

TWO MORE DEMOCRATS HEARD. Mr. McClellan (Dem., N. Y.) opposed the bill. "I do not wish it understood.'' said be, "that I advocate the present system of bank note cur? rency. The first dlreet Consequence Of the enact ment of this appeal will he a very great raise in the market price of Government bonds. Let BBS illustrate by on.- class of bonds, the Js--'> l'i per cents The l.oni syndicate assumed under the terms Of their contract that a 4 per cent coln bond at : ?'2 1? equal in value to a 3 p>-r cent gold bond St ?ur.

The substitu? tion Of the word gold' for the word '.oin' would result In Hn unearned bonus ol over sixty millions to the holder* of the loan of*lgsj alone." Mr. Mct'lellan said the enactment of the bill would result In the extinction of the present bank? note currency. He argued that the impounding of the Treasury notes md the I'nlted State?, notes under the terms of the bill would r.-suii m a con? traction of the currency amounting to over tWi.OOJ. Oio and require sn issu., of bonds to that amount at an annual coat of |8,"oo,(?o. or a total contraction of the currency of nearly $510,u?o/?xpo and a ledue tion of the per capita to $19 21. In conclusion he appealed to the Round Money I)emoerats In the House not to rote for the MIL "Sound Money Democrats," said he. "this bill do^-s not aid the cause of sound money I beg you. I Implore you, before you resolve to cast your votes fcr It. bring to Its consideration all the patriotism that is in vim.

(Democratic applause! Mr De Armond (Dom.. Mo.) followed In opposi? tion to the bill. Replying to Mr. Dolllver. he said the Democrats bal not been overborne In lfW in the conflict of reason, bul th.- Republican partj bad won by summoning to Its all the corrupt and tremendous power of money and corporation* He charged the Republicans with deceiving the people in lWfi They were Limeta lists then.

Now he sees employment for his eloquence In asserting the righteousness of the defensive war In which the two Dutch So th Afri? can republics have be.-ome || volved. Mr. Mason has versatility und range, and his new venture Into International politics was followed bj" the oc? cupants of the Senat? galleries with fe. lings of In? terest, In which, however, tuen- waa no element either of shock or surprise. The resolution on which Mr. Mason base,) h.:-. spOSCh was referred at the close of his addresa to the Foreign Rela? tions Committee, Mr. I/idge considering It too delicate a question. In view of the position of this Government, to pns? upon without serious consid? eration. While Mr. Mason's address at times waa vehe? ment and almost passionate, he confined hlmsa?f most of the time closely to bis manuscript, speak? Ing at all times with force and vigor. In opening he said: The war between monarchy and republicanism began in earnest on July 4, i.to. and no treaty of peace lins aver '.x-t-n concluded, nor ever win be until this question I? settled right. The mon? archical trust company, though often quarslllng among themselves, have always agreed: on one thing, that a republic is a mistake. After quoting extensively from Daniel Webster's speerhes In support of his position, Mr. Mason continued: But we are told that Kngland was our friend In the war with Spain. How? Mer people wer" our friends bacanas her people are a Christian peopli . her Government 'has never been our irlen.i except for purpose* of Its own. I have no desire to twist the lion's tall, but truth compels the state? ment so far a* our Interests are concerned fur the last half century the government of longland and the people of Kngland have been divided.

I !?-.- the fact thal the South African war was << atrvggle between demooracv and rovalty between the divine right of kings and the divine right of man "If we should speak," he declared, "and speak quickly, it would atina the politicians who brought on th.- war for greed of p..M and cheer the poor, hrave Dutch defender of lils home." Mr Mason contended that the question involved In the controversy between Great Hrltaln and the Transvaal, prior to hostilities, was simply one of supremacy in South Africa." "And I ask." said he, "In common Justice, what right has fjreat Bril tin to be supreme In South Africa' It is n fight to con? trol South Africa, arl the .inly ars) England could do it was to threaten, bulidose, browbeat and Inter? fere witta the Uutchniiui until, out "f sheer humilia? tion and desperation he was driven to fight."

He dec'ared that no nation, except a professed bully, would make the demands upon another that Great Urltain made upon the Transvaal Republic, and in closing said: i hare net sought to .xcit.- prejudice by our past difference* with England They are forgotten and forgiven But when ih>- color* of a republic are struck and ITS sit silent.

Ion of the clause of the President's Massai M, MM, sxemptlng Spanish ve? lela In Amerloan ports from the operation of the proclamation of the war until May 21 following It was shown that the , entura had left an Amer? ican port <r. the (lulf of Mextoe on April 19. seven davs b?fete the President's proclamation wa? Is? sued, and that she was captured on the 26th of that month of the annie day on willoh the proclam? ation appeared. The decision turned un the point as to whether the I'resid. nts exemption order uppiie.i to Spanien v?asela nrhl ita had left American ports for ports lu a neutral country prior to the Issuance of the proc'lmatlon. Justice Peckham'* opinion held that It did apply to v?asela under this condition, and that on this account the Vent? ura, though owned by a Spanish house, waa ex? empt. He said that the policy of the I'nlted States always liad been one of liberality in such cases, and that there was no reason for a change of policy nt thU tim". Ha therefore hell that the owners were entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the vessel. Justices Ur.iv and McKunna dissented from the opinion Tho chief Justi'e delivered the opinion of the Court In the a?c* of tiie l'e.lro and the Huido, snd while the condemnation of these vessels was af? firmed there were dissents In both instance?.

The chief Justice m his opinion in this ease stated the facts to be that the Pedro bad left Antwerp in M in \ with a .-argo for Cuban ports with the inten? tion of afterward proceeding to the i'nlted States for a cargo Of lumber for her return voyage. 8he reached Havana on April it. and on the :"j.| Bailed for Santiago. Cuba, and was captured the same ga) ' the cruleer New-York and duly condemned lu passing on the merits of the casa the Chief Jus? tice held that war bad been practically declared on -, snd that th.- ofleera of the vessel must have known tbia fact li? dwell on the fact that t.-.e vessel was proceeding frota " port of the enemy to another port of the enemv when overtaken, and contended that the case did not come under any of the exemptions of the President'?. Message Justice White in his dissenting opinion called at? tention to the feet that the Psdro bad been for nlno v- im engaged In a regular line of business between Antwerp and th? Cnited States, rta Cuba, and said that the landing of the light cargo she carried to Havana was only an incident, as It was not nearly so important as the cargo of lumber which was to be carried from the I'nlted Stuteg on the return.

Hall, Bird and lennon were on hoard walting to board Incom? ing ateamers, Hnd It was Lennon'? watch on d?rk. A keeper, steward and crew of four men were als>o | on the ahlp. The scene wn? a? peaceful as a country church? yard until, like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. a ?wlftly travelling R-lnch ?hell, which was ti dummy shell, but nevertheless ?creamed like a real one, came rlcochettlng over the water from Sandy Hook straight toward the pilot boat. It barely misled the hull of the boat, und like a streak of lightning skimmed over the de. k between the fore ?in.l main masts and just under the boom of the foresail. The ?taraall Mock on the starboard ?ide wa? ?mashed tn apllntera, a *tanchlon was carried away nn.i the peak halyards disappeared completely This ? .used the peitk of the foresail to take s audden drop A ; chain plate was also knocked out The ?heil struck the water fifteen feet beyond the ihlp and ?auk.

Mr McLaugh 11 ii in eilll ii hal. sr..l rio.irty man .1. -Kite, his hav? ing rea ra and ten, and his Interest in practical politics la just a* kcoi as ever, al? ii he admits that h" doesn't want any more fghtlng. He l'krs to win victories now by dip? lomatic, methods, rather than by crushing an op? ponent or district leader A prominent Brooklyn lawyer, In commenting on the Democratic situation in Kings yesterday, said: One of the principal reasons why "Bos=s" ne? ilin will rem mu lions In King? Is that his stanchaat and braiuleat friends ar.- to be found among several Judges of the Supreme Court wh<> ?ran elected on the Democratic ticket in Kings. McLaughlin owes ids ?nr.-?ni in no small degree to the fact that he has depended on s^me of these Judges to a large extent for advice. In the spring of i?96 he organisation leaders wanted to como out openly for Bryan, and i kintore.I foi permission to do so. The "old mnn" heard ill the arguments of the admirer* of Bryan, and then he gave ear to n coterie of Judge? and lawyers who ?ire designated sometimes as the. "Kiooklyn club crowd." He took the sdvice of the la'ter. and tree ?liver received n bia. k eye. It Is said hy Mr. Mclaughlin's inti? m?t? friends that he voted for Bryan, but at the ??m.? tlmH allowed the Impression to spread that h? did not want to see him get a large vote in Kings. McKinley carried the county by about thlrtv-flve thousand, and the old boss" wt.s highly gratified. There are a numner of prominent Democratic lawyers in the Brooklyn Club who want to ?ecure a nomination for the bench when their 'urn comes. and If Ki Laughlin continu?e to hold tne reins of power they know their turn will come after a while. The lid Judicial District Is naturally Demo? cratic in every year but a Presidential year, and this Is why the "Brooklyn Club crowd" stand to win mor? under the leadership of Mclaughlin than under any other, and that ia why the Influence of the most prominent Democratic lawyers In Brook? lyn la given freely to "Boss" McLaughlin. In that way the aged chieftain "works both ends" of the party, and no doubt lie will continue to run things from the Willoughby-at. auction rooms and the domino room in tho basement of the Borough Hall just ae he haa for the last quarter of a century, moro or loss. -?.

Dec. 11.?The Metacomet Manu? facturing Company began to run overtime to-night, working two shifts of operatives. The reason for this Is that the company has large contracts for quick delivery, and will be unable to fill them un? less overtime work Is done. Besides the Metacomet three other mills sre run? ning day and night because of large contracts. Cther corporations are considering the advisability of running night?, but It Is believed that a scarcity of help will prevent such a movement becoming general. The labor unions are opposed to nicht running, and should the managers of local mills endeavor to make night work a part of their regu? lar schedule steps will be taken toward remedying j the practice. TO EXTEND THE BONDINI! PRIVILEG*. ! Washington, Dec. 11. -Representative Payne, of j New-York prospective chairman of the Ways and j Means Committee, to-day Introduced In the House a bill extending the privilege of shipping goods lu bond across the country, -without reference to the destination of the goods. At present this free bond- ? Ing privilege is restricted to goods going to the ad Jaeeat territory of Canada or Mexico Mr Payne Baye the effect of this has been to cut ?iff much i transcontinental trafile in goods destined for re- '? mote pointe In Asia and elsewhere, which traille WM taken by the ('Anadian railroads. lils bli! seeks to open the privilege to all countries alike on the same terms that Canada and Mexico have enjoyed the system, and Mr Payne says It Is dis? tinctly favorable to American transportation inter? ests. The bill does not change the statue relativo to the Mexican free ion*, that portion of the bill being a repetition of the present law.
