A Matter of Knowledge By JULIA TRUll'T BISHOP (Copjrfgkt. 1MI. by Anthers SjndleaSa.) MT AM comr. I Martin, thin? but satis pelled to tell you, Mrs. that your niece is. any satisfactory. Mrs. Martin finished counting her 1 itches, and then looked up with an expression that was almost like sur prise. "Why, Mr. Martin!" she said, in that gentle little tone of hers; "I am sure 1 thought you thought UJ thought you thought," roared the judge. "What do you mean by all that conglomeration, Mrs. Martin? Did you really think anything on the sub ject? No, madam, you cannot prove that you did. What you took for thoughts were merely impressions, and very inaccurate ones at that. Your impression was that 1 was sat isfied with Leonora. A week ago that might have been true, but now it is not." Mrs. Martin arched her eyebrows to express surprise, because she was counting more stitches and could not apeak just then. "Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen," she said, presently. "What has Leonora been doing, Mr. Martin?" - "Oh, it all comes of not having taken her when we took Ethel," said the judge, still tramping madly and care fully about the room. "We raised Ethel ourselves; or rather, I raised her, for you are a slave to that fancy work, which the gods confound! and now look at Ethel! I tried to get you to send for both of them, but you must let your sister take Leonora, and now she comes to us, and the result shows that your sister was a woman totally deficient in judgment, Mrs. Martin, totrflly!" "Yes, but nine, ten, e-lev-en what has Leonora been doing, Mr. Martin?" . "Doing, ma'am? She has been do ing nothing. It is the things she has said. You know very well the plans I have been making for her a hand some girl like that a girl that could marry anybody, ma'am anybody! and I took pains to throw Jerry Cor dovan's son into her society, and I really thought she was pleased with him and so last week I hinted that nothing would delight tae more. And what do you think she said, Mrs. Mar tin? What do you suppose Miss Leon ora had the effrontery to sav to me?" "I am sure I don't know," said Mrs. Martin, helplessly. "Why, she straightened herself up and said: 'Uncle Ad, I haven't the slightest objection to your contin uing to choose my dresses for me, or even my hats and shoes, for I don't like shopping; but I am going to choose my husband for myself, if you please!' Think of it! The ungrate ful minx said that to me! That comes of taking girls after other people have raised them! And ever since then she's been as cold as ice to Frank Cor dovan, and has had no ryes for any . body but that Morris boy a nobody! a a private secretary to a tenth-rate congressman!" "Maybe you don't understand Leon ora," suggested Mrs. Martin, as a plausible way out of the difficulty. The tramp up and down the room ceased and an -apoplectic countenance was turned upon the lady with the fancy work and John, the colored servant, who had come in to put on more coal, remarked to the cook a few minutes afterwards: "Hi, de ole jedge suttingly do take on when he lose his temper! Ef he ic'.ild jes stan' off an hear hisself a rarin' nn' a pitchin' when he get riled, he'd sho put himself in de lock-up fo distu'bin' de peace!" "Mrs. Martin, how do yon suppose I have ever been able to obtain my present position at the bar without being a judge of human nature as well mm if tlif. lnw? TV, vnn not. knnw flint I am considen d the best judge of men in the state that it has been re marked in the press that I have the faculty of reading men at a glance? and do you insinuate that I am not able to judge a slip of a girl, not 20 years old? Xonsense! I know all about it! 1 know that she is a per verse young woman, bent on her own destruction. If she marries a nobody like that secretary, I'll never see her again never! No, madam, I will not! Ah, here's my girl! Where you have been this morning, little kitten?" Little Kitten, leaning her head on his shoulder "Down to the book store. Uncle Ad, to get that magazine you wanted." Uncle Ad, radiant "Ah, just see that! She barely heard me mention that magazine.; and yesterday it was to get my umbrella mended. She never forgets her old Uncle Ad, does he, pet?" Pet, twisting the topmost button of his coat and smiling up at him ra diantly "You were quarreling when I came in, you know you were. Didn't you know that you are not allowed to quarrel? What was it about, sir? Tell mc this instant!" Uncle Ad, beginning to grow red again "Oh, nothing at all. I am only amazed at jour sister, Ethel simply amazed at her! there, don't get ex cited, pet, it's nothing serious. I was merely remarking that if your sister took it into her head to marry a no body, like that Morris Gray, then I am done with her forever." - Pet pretending to shake him by means of .the button "Oh, you dr adf nl old ogre! You know you'd forgive her in a week!" Ogre, furiously "Forgive her, Bitss? What do you know about it? Only let her try it, that's alL I really think she'd be silly enough to do it; and now that I have warned her I shall THE FlST

Gleefully shouts as the careless may What shall I ay oh, what shall I seyT When her iKtte one kneels to-night. Oh, what shall I say? Wb hs pray for her who was left Out there to-dy. When b ass mo s messing xor asr and leave her to think ft over And act for herself. There, well not talk of it any more. Get the macazinc and read me that article 1 was talking about." The reader will suppose that a week has elapsed since the conversations just recorded, and that the gout has, to use an expression of John8j"got de ole man floored." In this condition his temper is not angelic. John and the cook have agreed on that point, and the family have been equally cer tain of the fact in question. Leonora has heard the changes rung on her exasperating and undutiful and un grateful conduct, every day, and has been reminded, many times over, of the awful fate that awaits her if she persists in her present most astonish ing and unwomanly course. But having made this assertion for the hundredth time, until Leonora may be supposed to have grown some what accustomed to it, the gout gave him an extra twinge one day, just as Miss Leonora came in, smiling and rosy, and heard of this desperate fu ture without a tremor. "But why should I care?" roared the judge, nursing his foot and his wrath with equal tenderness. "As you make your bed, so you must lie. Marry anybody you like, miss! Marry the dev " "Oh, Uncle Ad!" cried Miss Leonora, rushing at him jubilantly. "Do you really mean that you are not going to try to make me marry Frank?" "Make you marry?" shrieked Uncle Ad, wild with rage. "Don't be a fool, Leonora!" 'Oh, Uncle Ad, I'm so glad, because, you know, I like Frank and I think he likes me in fact, we like each oth er" "What do you mean? What do you as I live, you minx, you are in love with Frank!" Miss Leonora, with a prim and fetching air "But, Uncle Ad, you know I was not going to be made to marry anybody!" Uncle Ad, limping wildly around the room "Ha, ha, ha! The cunning little rascal! Mrs. Martin, come here! Think of her fooling her old uncle that way! Where's Ethel? John, call Ethel I want her I want her this minute. How surprised she'll be! You little hypocrite! That's one time I was taken in, I'll admit that. John, you idiot, what are you grinning at?" John, sober on the instant "I wan't a-grinnin', seh. Please, sch, heah's a note dat was jes' lef at de do' by a white man, seh." Judge, searching vainly for his spec tacles, and unable to find them be cause they are on top of his head "Confound those glasses! Here, Mrs. Martin, read this letter!" Mrs. Martin, reading "Dear Uncle Ad, Morris and I were married this morning at St. Paul's. We have been engaged ever since a month before Leonora came, and we didn't want to run away, but what else could we do? We know that you can never forgive us, so we won't ask it; and, of course, we'll be poor, but we don't mind that. So, good-by, dear old Uncle Ad, and dear Auntie and Leonora. Your Lit tle Ethel." The sensitive reader will please ex cuse himself for a few moments and leave the room until the worst of the storm has blown over. By this means he will retvrn just in time to see the judge raging up and down with a limp and a look of agony, and to hear him roariug, lion-wise: "Ethel! Ethel! That child! Why, I could have told every thought she ever had, from her cradle up. She was as transparent as glass, madam! And here she has been engaged for months, under my very nose! Where did she meet him? When did she see him? Hew did they ever have a chance to talk about love? And I believe Leo nora knew ell about it! Ah, look at Ler face! It makes a man doubt the evidence of his own senses when he can be circumvented, hoodwinked, de ceived, by these girls in pinaforesl And to deceive me--me!" Mrs. Martin, innocently "But, Mr. Martin, I thought it was Leonora that you didn't want to marry Mr. Gray. You never said a word about Ethel. If you didn't war t Ethel to marry him, why didn't you f-ay so? and then, of course, I would have tried to prevent it, for anybody misht have known that he und Ethel were in love with one an other." Judge, Maggering back and sinking into a chair "Ha! Another! Mrs. Martin, do I understand anybody? Does any man understand any wom an in the world? Are you a woman with a mania for f;ucy work? or are you a female Sherlock Holmes, with a pebble in one pocket and a red eye lash in the other?" He kicked at the stool before him, and then remembered his gout, with a shriek of anguish, and threw a mag azine at John, who hud forgotten to leave the room. "Are you standing there grinning yet, you Cheshire csit?" he cried. "Why haven't you gone tfter her, sir? Go and bring her back at once, do you hear? at once! Who takes care of me like Ethel? Write a note, Leonora, and tell her to coiae. I suppose you might as well tell 'em both to come," he added, grudgingly, "for just as like ly as not she'd refuse to leave him. Nobody knows. The man who thinks he -understands women is a fool." "Sixteen, seventeen, eigh teen, murmured the female Sherlock Holmes. "Yes, seh, I'll git 'em home, seh," said John, whose countenance was all one broad grin. "I knowed you wan't a-goin to ho" out no time." "Another!" groaned the judge. "Another!" And after several min utes of silence, the judge, a very deep ly humbled judge now, remarked meekly: "Angelina, that is a very pretty thing you are making. I don't think I ever noticed it before."

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Oplwloaa ( the Press Resrardlasj Roosevelt's First State Paper to Coasren. The president's message is not short. This is not a short-message sountry. Indianapolis News (Ind.). Ohio congressmen and senators laud the message of President Hoosevelt. Ohio always was in touch with the country. Cinciiyiati Commercial. What the president didn't say with regard to trust regulation and tariff restriction is what the people wanted most to hear. St. Louis Republic. Greater messages have been writ ten by presidents of the United States; but no message has been bet ter written. What he has to say, he says in a clean-cut English; no jug srling; no maudlin sentimentality. He drives straight into his subject and dismisses it as soon as possible. Indianapolis News (Ind.) President Roosevelt's first, message is the most comprehensive that has come from the white house for many years, but long as it is the American people will find it worth their while to read it through. The style is clear and animated, the questions treated in many instances affect the great ness and the welfare of the country and the commendations are of the first importance. N. Y. Sun. The message is so voluminous and so crammed with discussion of mat ters of wide interest that it is im possible to crowd an adequate review of it within a moderate space. It is characterized by the lofty spirit and high purpose of its author. Much is left to the unguided wisdom of con gress, which may imply a Incoming modesty on the part of the president, coming suddenly to the duties that had filled the mind and ripened the judgment of his predecessor. N. Y. Mail and Express. President Roosevelt's messaire is like the man practical, business-like, straightforward, earnest and strenu ous. Though a literary man as well as statesman there is no attempt at fine writing in it. The condensed de partment reports are omitted by the president. This is a wholesome in novation. It leaves the nu ssage all his own. It contains plain state ments of facts and literally bristles with recommendations, which show the suggestive and resourceful char acter of the man. Congress will have to hold night sessions to dispo-- of the business which the president lias cut out and laid before it for action. Chicago Tribune. President Roosevelt's lfse. The fear expressed that the presi dent's message would be too long was idle. It is safe to say that no man will count the words, but that every one who takes it up will read it through with relish. From the first paragraph, with its tender tribute to the memory of Mr. Mc Kin ley, to the last, with its earnest expression of appreciation of the foreign sympaihy offered to the nation in its hour of sorrow, the paper is one of individuali ty and of interest. It leaves no impor tant question untouched, and it dis courses of none in any obscure or halting fashion. The man of opinions gives his opinions in clear and concise style, and so as to impress upon the reader the belief in the author's ab solute sincerity. A trained writer and thinker, holds the pen, and he holds it very firmly. Congress, at any rate, cannot complain, because the consti tutional requirement that the presi dent shall from time to time make sug gestions to that body with relation to the state of public business and the public welfare was never more com pletely compiled with. Here are sug gestions enough to Inst the session. And all of them are good. Lucky will the country be if even the half of them are followed. Washington Star. A Great Paper. No president's message, except the war messages of Lincoln and MeKin ley, was ever looked for with greater interest than the message of Presi dent Roosevelt. Knowing the man and appreciating the circumstances under which he took up the duties of his of fice, public expectation was high, but the message more than meets it. It is a great paper from the standpoint of the masters in statecraft, from the standpoint of the literary man and the scholar, from the standpoint of the people attached to our institutions and interested in public questions. It shows the grasp of the statesman, the training of the scholar and the man of affairs, 'and reflects the spirit of an intensely patriotic people. Chicago Inter Ocean. If there are any who expected that President Roosevelt's message would be a startling one, in whole or in part, they are well disappointed. The doc ument which the president of the United States transmitted to the con gress shows in every line that the man who wrote it is the man who pledged himself, over the dead body of his slain predecessor, to carry out the policies of the McKinley adminis tration. It is a product of careful thought. Albacy Journal

The bright Hyde Park boy chewed gum and saw no reason for the trick monkey abstaining from such enjoy ment. "The Italian organist was grind-, ing out his stock of tunes at Fifty fifth street and Lake avenue the other day while the trained monkey passed the hat. The boy who, was chewing gum, noticed the monkoy watching him closely and divided with the animal. "Joko" put his share in his mouth, where it stuck, and he was unable to extricate it. He jumped and squirmed and pulled his collar off. When free he ran up a telegraph pole. From the top cf the pole he sprung to a house top, still trying to get rid of the gum. The Italian made frantic efforts to run, burdened with his hand organ, shout ing to "Joko." At last "Joko" got rid of the sticky stuff and came back to its master. Chicago Record. His Salary Not Proportionate. There was one occasion when Sir Henry Irving received from one of the supernumeraries of the Lyceum an an swer which seemed to satisfy him. It was the man's duty to say simply: "The enemy is upon us," which he ut tered at rehearsal in a poor, whining way. "Can't you say it better?" shouted Irving. "Repeat it as I do." And he gave the words with dignity, with all his well-known dramatic force. "If I could say it like that," replied the man, "I shouldn't be working for 25 shillings a week." "Is that all you get?" "Yes." "Well, then, say it as you please." Chicago Times-Herald. Not So Sickly After All. Last week a negro convict was taken from Wichita to-the penitentiary.
