A Document Full of Practical Sug gestion* and Extreme Good Seme. *vv Washington, Deo. 6.—To the senate and house oi representatives of the Unit ed States: An appalling calamity has befallen the American people sinoe their chosen rep resentatives last met in the balls where yon are now assembled. We might recall with unalloyed content the pros perity with whioh throughout the year the nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous its varied indus tries have thriven the health of the peo ple has been preserved ithas maintained with foreign governments the undisturb ed relations of amity and peace. For these manifestations of hfe favor we owe to him who holds our destiny in his bands the tribute of our grateful devo tion to that mysterious exercise of will which has taken from us the loved and illustrious citizen who was bat lately the head of the cation we bow in sorrow and submission. The memory of his exalted charaoter, of his noble aohieveirifents^md of his patriotic life will be treasured lor- 1 ~ISS#ffi S?c 6 It p* ever as a sacred possession of the whole people. The announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and peo ple tributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will regard as the signal tokens of the kinship of nations and the fraternal union of mankind. The feeling of good will between our own govern ment and that of Great Britain was nev er more marked thim at prescjbt. In rec ognition of this pleasing fact I directed on the occasion of the late centenial cele bration at Yorktown that a salute be giv en to the British .flag. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Save for the correspondence to whioh I shall hereafter refer in relation to the proposed canal across the isthmus of Panama little has occurred worth men tioning in the diplomatic relations of the countries. Early in the year the Fortune bay claims were satisfactorily arranged by the British government paying in the sum of d£15,U00,moet of which has already been distributed. As the terms of settle ment include compensation for injuries suffered by our fishermen at Aspec bay, there has been retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate tor those claims. The participation of America in the exhibition at Melbourne and Sidney will be approvingly mentioned in the reports of the two exhibitions soon to be pre sented to congress. They will disclose the readiness of our countrymen to make successful competition in the various fields of enterprise. Negotiations for an international copyright convention are in hopeful pro gress. The surrender of Sitting Bull and his forces upon the Canadian frontier has al Inyed all apprehensions, although bodies of hostile Indians still cross the border in quest ot sustenance. Upon this sub ject a correspondence has been opened which promises an amicable understand ing. Our troops have orders to avoid, meanwhile, all collisions with alien Indi ans. FRANCE. The presence at the Yorktown celebra tion of representatives of the French re public and descendents of la Fayette and of his gallant compatriots who were .. our allies in the revolution, has served to strengthen the spirit of good will which has always existed between the two nations. You will be furnished with the proceedings of the bi-metallic con ference during the summer at the city of Paris. No accord was reached, but a valuable interchange of ideas was had and the conference will next year be re newed. At the electoral exhibition and congress, also held at Paris, ttis conn try was creditably represented by emi nent specialist, who, in the absence of an appropriation, generously. lent their efficient aid at the instance of the state department. While our exhibitions in v: this almost exclusively American field of achievements have won several awards, I recommend that congress provide for the repayment of the personal expenses incurred in the public interest by the honorary commissioners and delegates. GERMANY. No complaints respecting the status of our naturalized citizens in Germany have arisen during the year, and causes of complaint, especially in Alsace and Lorraine, have practically ceased through the liberal action of the imperial govern ment in accepting onr often expressed our views on the subject. The application of the treaty of 1868 to the lately acquired Bhenish prov inces has received very earnest atten tion. A definite and lasting agreement on this point is confidently expected. The participation of the descendants of Baron von Steuben in the Yorktown festivities, and their subsequent recep tion by their Amerioan kinsmen, strik ingly evinced the ties of good will which unite the German people and our own. Our intercourse with Spain has been friendly. An agreement concluded in February last fixes for a term the labors of the Spanish and American claims commissions. The Spanish government has been requested to pay the late award of the commission, and will, it is believed, accede to the request as promptly and courteously as ou former occasions. By recent legislation onerous fines have been imposed upon American shipping in Spanish and colonial ports for slight irregularities in manifests. One case of hardship is worthy of attention. The bark Masonic, bound for Japan, entered Manmlla in distress, and is there sought to be confiscated under the Spanish rev enue laws for alleged shortage in her shipped cargo. Though efforts for her relief have thus far proved unavailing, it is expected that the whole matter will be adjusted in friendly spirit. BU8BIA. The sAate resolution of condolence upon the assassination of the czar Alex ander II was appropriately communica ten to the Russian government, whioh in turn has expressed its sorrow in our late national bereavement. It is desirable that our cordial relations with Russia should be strengthened by proper enact ments, assuring to peaceable Americans who visit the empire that consideration which is due them as citizens of a friend ly state. This i« especially needful with respect to Amerioan Israelites, whose classification with the native Hebrews has evoked energetic remonstrances from this government. A consular agreement with Italy has been sanctioned which it is now claimed pats at rest the conflicts of jurisdiction 1 1 '•Iv "i -A "P l*r in the MM of crimes ou nhipUonrd. Ser eral important internaliomil conferences haw been beld in IUlr duriug the year. At the geotfraphioal aonrreaa of Venioe, the Bonifaoe oonorecd of Mill ilui and the Nice congress of Turin. this oountry was represented by delegates from branches of the publie service, or by private citi- sens duly accredited in an honorary ca pacity. It is hoped that congretB will give suoh prominence to the results their participation as they may seem to deserve. The abolition of all discriminating du ties against oolouial productions of the East Indias imported hither from Hol landses been already considered by congress. I trust that at the present cession the .matter may be favorably con cluded. vi .. 

TCRKEV. -bk, i! The peril of life and properly in many parts of Turkey has given use to corre spondence with the porte looking to the better protection ot American mission aries in the empire. The condemned murderer of the eminent missionary. Dr. Justin Parsons, has not yet been execu ted, although the government has re peatedly demanded that exemplary jns tioe be done. The Swiss government has solioited the good offices of our diplomatic and consular agents for the protection of its citizens in countries where it is not itself represented. The request has within proper limits been granted. Our agents in Switzerland have been instructed to jrotest against the conduct of the au ihorities of certain communities in per mitting the emigration to this country of criminals and other objectionable per sons. Several such persons through the eO-operation of the commissioners of em igration at New York have been sent back by the steamers whioh brought them. A continuance of this course may prove more effectual than diplomatic remonstance. Treaties of commerce and navigation and for the regulation of consular privil iges, have been concluded with Bouma ma and Servia since their admission into, the family of European states. insxico. As is natural with contiguous states having like institutions and like aims of advancement and development, the friendship of the United States andMex ioo been constantly maintained. The gov ernment has lost no occasion of encourag ing the Mexican government to a bene ficial realization of the mutual advan tages which will result from more inti mate commercial intercourse, and the opening of the rich interior of Mexioo to railwav enterprise. I deem it important that means be provided to restrain the lawlessness unfortunately so common on the frontier and'to suppress the forays of the reservation Indians on their side of the Bio Grande. CENTRA! AMERICA The neighboring states of Central Amerioa have preserved internal peace and their outward relations toward us have been those of intimate friendship, and there are more encouraging signs of their growing disposition to subordinate their local interests to those which are common to them by reason oi their geographical relations. The boun dary dispute between Guatemala and Mexico has afforded this government an opportunity to exercise its good offices for preventing a rupture between these states and for procuring a peaceful solu tion of the question, ana I cherish a strong hope that in view of our relations of amity with the countries onr friendly counsel will prevail. The Costa Kican government lately formed an engage ment with Columbia, settling by arbitra tion the boundary question between those countries, presiding that the post of arbitrator shonla be offered succes sively to the king of the Belgians, king of Spain and the president of the Argen tine confederation. The king oi the Belgians has declined, but I am not ad vised of the action of the kinpr of Spain. As we have certain interests in the dis puted territory which are protected by our treaty engagement with one of the parties, it iB important that the arbitra tion should not, without our consent, al tect our righs, and this government has accordingly thought proper to make its views known to tlie partus to the agree ment and to intimate the same to the Belgian government. The questions growing out of the pro posed inter-oceanic water way across the isthmus of Panama are of g"ave natured importance. This government has not been unmindful of the solemn obliga tions imposed upon it by its compact oi 1816 with Columbia as the independent and sovereign mistress of the territory crossed by the canal, and has sought to render them effective by tresh engag ments with the Columbia tepublic lool ing to the practical execution of the ne gotiations to this end. After they had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here they were met in Columbia by a disavowal of the pow ers which its envoy had assumed, and by a proposal for renewed negotiations on a fortified basis. Meanwhile this govern ment learned that Columbia had pro posed to the European powers to join in a guarantee of the neutrality of the pro posed Panama canal—a guarantee which would be in direct contravention of our obligation as to the integrity of Colum bian territory, and of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamented predeces sor felt it his duty to place before the European powers the reasons which made the prior guarantee of the United States indispensable, and for which the inter jection of any foreign guarantee might be regarded as a superfluous and un friendly act. Foreseeing the probable reliance of the British government on the provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850 as affording room for a share in the guarantees which the Uni ted States covenanted with Columbia four years before. I have not hesitated to supplement the action of my prede cessor by proposing to her majesty's gov ernment the modification of that instru ment and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not conform with the obli gations of the United States toward Columbia, or with the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact. This government sees with great con cern the continuation of the hostile rela tions between Chili, Bolivia and Peru. An early peace between these republics is much to be desired, not only that they may themselves be spared further misery and bloodshed, but because their contin ued antagonism threatens consequences which are, in my judgement, dangerous to the interests of republican government on this oontinent, and calculated to des troy the best elements of our free and peaceful civilization. As in the present excited condition of popular feeling in these countries there has been serious isapprehension of the position of the nitea States, and as separate diploma tic intercourse with each, through inde pendent ministers, is sometimes subject, owing to the want of prompt communi cation, to temporary misunderstanding, I have deemed it judicious at the present time to send a special envoy accredited to all and each of them and furnished with general instructions which will, I trust, enable him to bring these powers into friendly relations. The government of Venezuela main tains its attitude of warm friendship and oontinues with great regularity its pay ment of the monthly quota of the diplo matic debt. Without suggesting the di rection in which oongress should act, I ask attention to the pending questions affecting the distribution of the sums thus far reoeived. These relations be­ tween Venezuela and France growing out of the samo debt havo been for some time past in an unsatisfactory state, and this government as the neighbor aud one of the largest creditors of Venezuela interposed itself with the French gov ernment with the view of producing a friendly and lionoiable adjustment. 

BRAZIL. I regret that the commercial interests between the United States and Brazil, from which great advantages were hoped a year ajro, have suffered from the with drawal of the American lines of oomtnu nioation between Brazilian porta and our own. Through the efforts of our minis ter resident at Buenos Ayres and tlio United States minister at Santiago, a treaty has been conoluded between the Argentine Bepublic and Chili, disposing of the loug pending Patagoniau bounda ry question. of It is a mutter of congratulation that our government has been afforded the opportunity of successfully exerting its good iufluenoe for the prevention of a disagreement between the rcpublica of the American continent. 

CHINA. I am glad to intorm you that the trea ties lately negotiated with Chiua have been duly ratified ou both sides, and the exohange made at Peking. Legislation is necessary to carry its provisions into effect. Tlio prompt and friendly spirit with which the Chinese government at the request of the United States con ceded the modification of existing trea ties should secure oareful regard for the interest and susceptibilities of that gov ernment in the enactmeut of auy laws relating to Chinese immigration. These olausesof the treaties which f-rbid the articipation of citizens or vessels of the United States in the opium trade will doubtless receivo your approval, aud they will attest the sincere interest which our people and the government feel in the commendable efforts of the Chinese government to put a stop to this demor alizing and destructive traffic. In rela tion both to China and Japan some changes are desirable in our present sys tem of counsel or jurisdiction. I hope at some future time to lay before you a scheme for its improvement in the entire east.
