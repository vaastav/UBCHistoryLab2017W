AVEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1011. President Taft's message to Congress will bo found in to-day's Citizen. It contains many good points. Read It. What is your attitude toward dividing Honesdale into election wards? Tho columns of The Citizen are open for criticism. 'In tho opinion of State Health Commissioner Dixon the shopper's judgment s clearer in the morning and better able to make decisions In volving matters of taste and economy. There is no reason why able-bodied men should not shovel or hire their sidewalks shoveled after a fall of snow. We know of instances where the snow lies unmolested, save for being trod upon, from tho time it falls until nature removes It. This is a violation of the borough ordinance and the violator should be fined. AS TO 

AMERICAN POTASH, Farmers in this country will be much Interested In the report that comes from Washington to the effect that rich potash deposits, said to be great enough to supply the needs of the United States, havo been discover ed in the West by scientists of the Department of Agriculture. This dis covery will mean a saving of $12,000,000 a year to this country, as horeto 1 fore the United States has been spending about that sum annually to buy its potash from Germany. GLOBE YARN STOCK SELLING FAST. Tho Greater Honesdale Board of Trade Is elated over the sale of stock of the Globe Yarn company, an advertisement of which appeared In last Friday's Citizen. Tho Board announced that thirteen thousand shares of slock, par value $10, non-assessable, were for sale. Four hundred and fifty shares have been disposed of, leaving twelve thousand, five hundred and fifty shares to be sold. Many havo signified their willingness to take stock and we hope that soon we will be able to announce that all the shares will have been sold. The business is already established and Is past Its experimental stage. It is, however, "up to the people." The Board of Trade has accomplished Its part it now remains with the townsfolk and Wayne counteans to do their share. This can be done by subscribing for tho stock. A share of stock ought to bo taken by everybody In Honesdale Do not delay In your subscriptions. If the sale continues as rapidly as it commenced it will not be on the market many days. Take advantage of your opportunity. ACTION OF McNAMARAS UNPRECEDENTED. The confession of the McNamara brothers is unprecedented. James B. McNamara pleaded guilty to the murder in tho first degree, Friday, and his brother, John J. McNamara, secretary of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers also entered a plea of guilty to hav ing dynamited the Llwellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles on Christmas Day, 1910. J am os B. McNamara's confession clears up absolutely the tragedy of tho explosion and fire which wrecked the plant of the Los Angeles Times and caused tho death of twenty-ono persons. 'For nineteen of these deaths tho McNamara brothers were Indicted and J. B. McNamara was on trial specifically for th6 murder of Charles J. Haggerty, whose ibody was found nearer than that of any other to the spot where the dynamite was suppos ed to have been placed. The example set by the McNamaras is disgraceful. They were honored by and looked upon as men of reason and Intelligence, but have since fall en to the lowest possible depths much to the chagrin of Union leaders. The action of the McNamara brothers has left a blot upon the pages of unionism that will take a long time to erase. How To Prepare Iloltdny Pncknges to Send TliroiiKli Malls. Already Christmas packages for foreign lands are being received at tho Honesdale postofllco. When sondlng articles through tho mail a few simple rules should bo remem bered. Here they are: First 'Wrap your article In paper strong enough to admit of several handlings with ink in tho lower right 'hand corner, or if ink is not available, use a good pencil and write plainly. Put your name and address In the upper left hand corner so your package may be returned if tho address Is rendered Illegible. Do not put writing in with other matter unless you wish to pay letter postage. You are permitted to use "Merry Christmas," and "Happy New Year" but no communications of any sort. When articles are to be registered you must have your name and ad dress, (street number will not suf fice) and the name, street number or rural number, town and state of the person to whom you wish to send tho register. Take your package to tho stamp window, have it weighed, affix the stamps and always wait for your receipts from tho registry clerk. If you wish a return receipt you must endorse it fee in any case is 10 cents in addition to the regular post age which Is as follows: First class All written matter with ink or typewriter, 2 cents for each ounce or fraction. Second class Includes all news papers, periodicals and magazines, 1 cent for each four ounces or frac tion. Third class Printed matter of all kinds books, pamphlets and pict ures i cent for each ounce or frac tion. The government has affixed a pen alty of ?10 for1 each offense where articles of a higher class are in cluded with those of lower class and an attempt made to send them through tho mails at the lower rate. A word about post cards may give you the reason why your last card did not reach your friend. Cards with tinsel or like substance must be enclosed in an envelope and se curely sealed and 2 cent postage affixed, otherwise they are sent to the dead letter office. On the ad- drss side you are permitted to use one-half the space and no more, for correspondence. If this rule Is not observed the card Is held for post age, which Is 2 cents. When using the transparent en velopes alllx the stamp to the envoi ope and not to the enclosed card. Every week post cards as well as other articles addressed to children aro sent to the dead letter office be cause no street or rural route or parents' name is given. The best plan in sending mall to children is to address it in care of the parents or persons with whom they aro staying. COSTUMES AND SCENERY. DESERVES SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY. The Woman's Auxiliary to the Wayne County Hospital Association de serves tho united support of the community in its effort to raise the de sired funds for a hospital. It not only needs the support, but should be given tho hearty co-operation of the public. Tho movoment Is a com mendable one and the officers are to be congratulated for the zealous man ner in which they are conducting tho campaign for raising money. To those in authority we would suggest to keep persistently and everlastingly at It. Exemplify to tho residents of Honesdale and Wayno county that sufficient money can bo raised for a hospital. 'By this exemplification you will olearly demonstrate that great character force stick-to-lt-ivo-ness which has never failed if given sufficient latitude. Wo admit that the 'ladles have undertaken a grand project, but under their supervision wo feel that It will be a success. Women have accom plished great things In tho annuals of history. The Ladles' Improvement association is an illustration of what can be done In our own community by concentrated effort. It Is an example of all work together for the im provement and betterment of conditions. Many of the members of the Hospital Auxiliary are associated with tho Improvement Association. That the hospital movement will be a success is evinced by this fact. Tho Citizen is In favor of the hospital agitation and will do all in Its power to encourage and help those prominently Identified In attaining the necessary capital that a hospital may bo built In Honesdale. Success to the project. 

MORE BLESSED TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE. At this time of the year our thoughts are diverted from the usual business cares to the Joys and pleasures of the holiday season and how we may best enjoy ourselves. We have experienced Thanksgiving's blessings and now look forward to Christmas. In our happiness, however, we do not want to forget those who are less fortunate than ourselves. All homes, for one reason or another, will not be as happy this year as thoy were upon former occasions, consequently it remains with us to do our part, humblo though It may be, to help make some of tho less favored ones happy. It is true that there are a number of people living 1n Honesdale and vicinity who aro in dire need of help. Old age has overtaken them and their physical conditions are impaired. Rheumatism, palsy and other maladies have fastened their grip upon them and incapacitated them for work. While tears were in their eyes our hearts went out in profound sympathy for them as they recently related their afflictions to us. Somo might say this is an Inopportune time, now that Christmas Is so near. Not so. The giver of charity would be blest and his blessing could bo used to better advantage now. The churches, Individuals and other organizations are doing much for charity, hut there Is no special so ciety devoted exclusively to that kind of work. To this end we claim Jionosuaio needs an organization of this character. An Associated Chari ties, organized for this specific purpose, is necessary. We have in mind tho heads of two families, who by unfortunate cir cumstances aro unable to work and we take this means of presenting their worthy and pitiable conditions before the public. We speak In words of highest praise for them and hopo that our readers will substantial the evidence by liberally remembering within the next two weeks these acred people. Let us lay aside a little of our Christmas money and establish a iuna ior sweet unaruys sane, rememDering mat it is more blessed to give than to receive." Wo will be happier and richer on Christmas morn for our donation. Money orders or checks may be made payable toCItlzen Publishing Company, Honesdale, Pa.

All monies received will bo presented to the cause for which it is solicited. Tne names or the contributors will be printed In The Citizen ana an account snowing tne disposition of the funds will bo made.
