THE MESSAGE Washington, Dec. 7. ? President W11-, son's annual message to congress fol lows: "When T addressed mys?lf to perform er the duty laid upon the president by the constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the Union, I found my thought dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's. j "* 'I^et us have faith mat right makes j might. ami in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it.' ? a sentence immortal because it embodies tin a form of utter simplicity and purity 'the essential faith of the nation, the laith in which it was conceived and ? the faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, an or?ier in which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful ? American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the ar rangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the affairs of the world. Hy this faith, and hy this faith alone, can the world bo lifted out of Its present confusion and despair. It was this faith which pre vailed over the wicked force of Ger many. You will remember that the be ginning of hhe end of the war came when thl? German people found them selves face to face with the conscience of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpetrate. I think therefore, that it Is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant went Into the field and out upon the seas to make sure our victory. Appeals tax Democracy "This is the mission upon which De mocracy ?ame into the world. Democ racy I* an assertion of the right of the Individual to live and be treated Justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of Individuals to make laws which will overburden him or Which will destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of right or privilege, and 1 think, we all realize that the day has come when Democracy la being put upon its final test. The whole world Is Just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of Democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spirit ual power to prevail. Tt is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead In tha attempt to make this spirit prevail. U> B. BUI XU> inw Ttiere aro two ways In which the Vnlted States can assist to accomplish thJs rreat object: First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will and power of Democracy to make and enforce laws which are un questionably Just and which arc equal !n their administration ? laws which se TOre Its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the Integrity ?(^""property. and particularly of that property which Is devoted to the devel opment of Industry and the Increase of ?*the necessary wealth of the world. Sec ond. by standing for right and Justice ^as towards individual nations. The law 0>t Democracy Is for the protection of ;]the weak, and the Influence of every .^??rao^rncy In the world should be for ^the protection of the weak nations, the nation which is struggling towards Its rlrht and towards Its proper recogni tion and privilege in the family of na tions. The 1'nited States eanrvot refuse this role of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the gr%at jand devoted men who brought Its gov ernment Into existence and established It in the face of almost universal oppo Bitlop and intrigue, even in the face of ?*?e??ton force, as. for example, against the orders in council of Great Britain and the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees which involved us in what we know as ihe \Vnr at 181 -. I urge you to con sider that tlio display of an Immediate disposition on the imr.t of the congress to remedy any injustices or evils that m*y have -snown themselves in our national lite will afford the most ineffectual offset to tho forces of chaos Sjlfl tyranny which are playing so dis? nstfyijs a part In the fortunes of the Tree peoples of more than one part of IhP world The I'nited states Is of necessity the sample Itemocrscy of the -world. and the triumph of Democracy depends upon its success. A Workable Budget Syrtexn. "Recovery from the ' disturbing and .jpjnetimes disastrous effects of the late j far has been exceedingly slow on the ..?Cher ? side of the water and has given "promise. I venture to say. of early com " plMton only In our own fortunate coun ' try: but even with us the recovery halts and is Impeded at times and there are " immediately serviceable acts of legis -lltlon which it seems to me we (>ugh' to. attempt. to assist that recovery and ...prove the Indestructible rcui?m; ive force of a great government of the peo One of these is to prove that a ' great Democracy can keep house as suc cessfully and in as business-like a fash "fftn as any other government. It seems to me that the first step towards prov Tn* this Is to supply ourselves with a systematic method of handting our esti mates and expenditures and bringing ??them to the point where they wttl not ? lfce an unnecessary strain upon our In come or necessitate unreasonable taxa tion In other words, a workable bud iwt system, and I respectfully suggest that two elements are essential to such a system: namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be In tb? bands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee in each ? bouse of the congress, but also that this bedy should be brought into such co operation with the departments of the -*OT?rament and with the treasury of tthe United States as would enable It to act upon a complete conspectus of the _pseds of the government and the re sources from which it must draw its income I reluctantly vetoe?j the hud get bill passed by the last session of the congress because of a constitutional "oWoction. The house of representative* ? - ;ttbsequcntly modifled the bill In order id meet this objection. ? In tne r?-v!sed B form I believe that the bill, coupled ^^wlth action already taken by the con ^Mrross to revise its rules and procedure. Burnishes the foundations for an effee ?ye national budget system. I earnest ly hope. therefore, that one of the first Bfeps taken by the present session of congress will be to pass the hud bHL Kfcxted naaadOl XmpioTemeat.

The total ordinary receipts of J5.694.0u0.o00 for the fiscal year 1920 exceeded those for 1919 by $l.S42.000.0"n while the total net ordinary expendi tures decreased from |18, 614, 000. 000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross public debt, which reached Its highest point on August 31. 1919 when It was $2^,596.000,000 had dropped on 30 Novwnt^r, 1920, to 124.175.000.000. . There has ?J*o been a marked decreased 1 In holding? of government war securities I by the banking institutions of the coun I try. as well as in the amount of bills | held by the Federal Iteserve banks, se j cured *bv government war obligations. This forttm&te result has relieved the ! banks and left them freer to finance the j needs of agriculture. Industry and eom j nieroe. It has been due in large part to the reduction of the public debt ; especially of the floating debt, but I more particularly to the improved ?lis ; tributkm of government securities [ among permanent investors. Tlie ! cessation of the government's borrow j ings except through short term certif icates of indebtedness has been a matter I of freiu consequence to the people of j the country at large, as well as to the j holders of Liberty bonds and Victory i notfs, and has ha dan important bearing | on the matter of effective credit control, i The year has be?-n characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury j from the domestic credit m?rl<#t and | j from a position of dominant influence I in that market. The future course will 'necessarily defend upon the extent to which economies are practiced and upon ! the burdens placed upon the treasury, as well ils upon Industrial developments and the maintenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high level. Expenditures Unit Be Cut. "The fundamental fact which at pres ent dominates the government's finan cial situation is that seven and a half billions of its war Indebtedness mature In the next two and a half years. Of this amount, two and a half billions are floating debt and five billions Vic tory notes and war savings certificates, j The fiscal program of the government must be determined with reference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that the government expenditures be re duced to the lowest amount which will permit the various services to operate j efficiently and that government re ceipts from taxes and salvage be main ? tained sufficiently high to provide for I current requirements. Including Inter est and sinking fund charges on the public debt and at the same time retire j the floating debt and party of the vic tory loan before maturity. With rigid I economy, vigorous salvage operations, I adoquate to rewrve from taxation, a sur plus of current receipts over current expenditures can be realized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the government should co operate to see that this program Is re - alized. "I cannot over emphasize the neces sity of economy In government appro priations and expenditures and the avoidance by the congress of practices which take money from the treasury by i Indefinite or revolving fund appropria lions. "The estimates for the present year. ' show that over a billion dollars of ex ! penditurcs were authorized by the last ' congress In addition to the amounts | shown in the usual compiled statemcpts of appropriations. AdrooUa Specific Approvrlatloms. "This strikinfely Illustrates the Im portance of making direct and specific i appropriations. The relation between , the current receipts and current expend | ltures of the government during the ' present fiscal year, as well as during the ! last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the trans portation act in connection with the re turn of the railroads to private control. Over $600,000,001 has already been paid to the railroads under the act ? $350,000. 000 during the present fiscal year: and It Is estimated that further payments 1 aggregating possibly $650,000,000 must I still be made to the railroads during the I current vear. It Is obvious that these large payments have already seriously limited the. government's progress in re ? tiring tRe floating debt. ITax Simplification TTrgrd. "Closely connected with this. It seems to me. is the necessity for an Immediate 1 consideration of the revision of our tax i laws. Simplification of the income and , profits taxes has become an immediate i necessity. These taxes performed an ln ? dispensable service during the war. The ! need for their simplification, however. ' is very great. In order to save the tax- | ! payer inconvenience and expense and In ] j order to make his liability more certain and definite. Other and more detailed recommendations with rc*ar 1 to taxes wilt no doubt be laid before you by the ; secretary of the treasury and the com missioner of Internal revenue. Aid for Disabled Soldiers. "It is my privilege to draw to the i attention of congress for very sym pathetic consideration the problem of i I providing adequate facilities for the care | i and treatment of former members of I the mtlltnrv and naval forces who are I ? sick or disabled as the result of their I I participation in the war. These heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patriotically rendered the nation. Their reward will He rather In realization of the fact th:it tney vin dicated the rights of their country and aided in safeguarding civilization. The nation's gratitude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample ' provision for their medical care and I treatment as well as for their vocational training and placement. The time has ' come when a more complete program can be formulated and more satisfac torily administered for their treatment and training, and I earnestly urge that the congress give the matter its early consideration. Tlie secretary of the treasury and the board for vocational education will outline In their annual reports proposals covering medical care and rehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study ani command ' your most generous support. Urges T.imlting Storage. "Permit me to empnasize once more the need for action ui>on certain mat ters upon which I dweit at some length j in mv message to the second session of the sixty-sixth congress: The neces sity. for example, of encouraging the 1 manufacture of dyestuffs and related I chemicals; tli- importance of doing I everything possible t<? promote agri-l j cultural production along economic i lines, to improve agricultural market i ing and to make rural life more attrac ' tive and healthful; the need for a law j regulating cold storage in such a way as to limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kep. ? beyond the permitted period, and requir ing goods released from storage in all cases being the date for their receipts "It would aWto be most serviceable if : it wore provided that all goods released j from cold storage for Interstate ship- i mont should have plainly marked on i ' oach package the selling or market J i price at which they went into storage, I In order that the purchaser might be' able to learn what profits stood between I htm and the producer of the wholesale 'dealer. Indeed It would be very service* [ ablt. to the public If all goods destined for interstate commerce were made to ! carry upon "every packing case whose I form made It p<w?slblc a plan statement of the price at which they left the hands 'of the producer. I respectfully call ! yv>ur attention also, to the recommerwla I tiojijs VIf the message referred to w>th I regard to h federal license for all cor porations engaged in interstate cum I merce. j "In brief the immediate legislative ! need of the time ts the removal of all j obstacles to the realization of the best i ambitions of our people in their seevral j classes of employment and the ftrength .enlng of all instrumentalities by which 'difficulties are to be met and removed j and justice dealt out. whether by law I er by some form of mediation and con ciliation. I do not feel it to he my privilege at present to suggest the de tailed and particular methods by which these objects may be attained, but I have faith that the inquiries of your j seevral committees will discover ths way and the methods.
