The state paper submitted by Secre tary of the Treasury Charles Foster is a condensation of not very inviting facts. At the termination of the fiscal year, June 30, there was remaining in the treasury a surplus of some $37,000, --000, despite the ravages of the late bill ion-dollar congress. The specious rea soning employed in the report to show that even this moderate surplus was not accumulated in the face of reprehensi ble extravagance, and solely through tariff burdens imposed upon the people, will hardly bear the test of close analy sis. In fact, the financial exhibit sim ply proves that only by the wildest ex travagance can the treasury surplus bo kept from mounting into a dangerous menace to the financial interests of the country. The exhibit of national bank ing operations lists a large per cent in Increase of the number of failures, which is, however, offset by a decrease in the amount involved in the aggregate. But the most depressing portion of the re port dwells upon the increase of a most objectionable class of immigrants from Russia, Hungary, Poland and China, against a decrease from England and other European powers from which we draw the better elements of our foreign population. This, it should be remem bered, is directly in the face of the sup posed most stringent alien and contract labor laws. It is a momentous matter, that may well give pause to the student of political economy, as well as the active participant in the framing of Immigration laws. No stream can rise higher than its source, and it is not to be expected that a vicious current of foreign immigration will become puri fied by simply flowing through the gates of Castle Garden. A steady infusion of a class known to be profligate and vicious into any population, no matter how high their standard of civilization and virtue, cannot fail to poison the un natural, heterogeneous mixture. Ten per cent of virtue wages an unequal combat against 90 per cent of vice, and the treasury statistics surely prove that the population of the United States is being steadily diluted by an objectionable class of immigration from the least prosperous countries of Europe. A WINTER -HEALTH RESORT. A pamphlet published by Dr. Ray mond, of New York, for the use of in valid parties the present winter, gives a list and description of the most desir able winter health resorts. Minnesota occupies a prominent place in the list, and St. Paul is specially indicated as having favorable conditions and con veniences for invalids. This state has a wide reputation as a summer resort, both for invalids and pleasure seekers; but even many residents do not realize the advantages it offers for winter resi dence. This pamphlet says it "possesses many qualities which render it suit able for such patients as desire a cold, dry, clear climate, with slight diurnal variations of temperature, and an abundance of sunshine." The ac count further says the location of the state protects it from sudden changes; and "the winters, while intensely cold, are well borne, because of the uniform temperature and the dryness of the at mosphere." These conditions are pro nounced "stimulating and beneficial to pulmonary and bronchial diseases ac companied by general debility or by malnutrition, or due to tuberculosis." A climate that in winter is beneficial to persons of weak lungs or consumptive tendencies must be an exceedingly healthful one for people not on the inva lid list,and necessarily enjoyable and in vigorating. The only mistake of the writer of the work is in terming the winters "intensely cold." ' That im pression, a tradition of the early times, has probably been kept alive by the at tempt some years ago to erect an ice palace. The last four winters the only apprehension has been that the ice crop would fail to ripen properly. The indi cations are that the present winter will aid further to dissipate the impression that the cold is at any time severe here, In fact, if the matter were left to popu lar vote, the temperature of the winters would be run down several degrees for the average. Still, for enjoyment and health, a great deal of travel will be requisite to find much improvement on Minnesota. 

CORN WANTED. There is another growing use for American corn in Germany. They have fouudout how to utilize it in making soap, and the extract has a fiery impulse that is forcing its Teutonic way. A better and cheaper alcohol Is had from it than from potatoes, which have been the source of this sort . : of • inspiration. In one week in November 10.000 barrels of alcohol were "exported from New York, the first, in many, years of any account. It is estimated that more than 50,000,000 bushels of .corn- will be re quired for this new demand from" the German distillers. Whether the agri cultural " bureau has been - pushing this use of corn upon foreign attention, or the fa/or shown by the- residents for this beverage lias had- effect or not, there will be a greatly increased- de mand for corn over the water.- * ".L-- THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. ; The president's message is a volumi uous and conventional document with out any features of : particular salieney. It is coherent, wel pressed, and gives evidence of that very respectable de gree of intelligence of which Mr. Har rison, somewhat to the surprise of ', the public, has shown himself possessed., It is open in general to the same criticism which was made of the prayer in llow ells' "A Modern Instance," in that it contains nothing especially calculated to interest youug people. The opening paragraphs reviewing our foreign rela tions will be found the most entertain ing portions. There is no recommenda tion that reparation be made to Italy for the New Orleans episode, as was expect ed in some quarters, ami the troubles with Chili are detailed with much full ness and the promise that further sug gestions on the same subject will follow after investigations now pending have been concluded. In the department of domestic politics the president expresses his renewed faith in the virtue of the McKixley bill and the Siieijmax silver law. lie says that the former-has disappointed the evil prophecies of its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful predictions of its friends, and that the same is true of the carrency legislation of the last congress, lie admits that it. may be plausibly argued that changes in our laws on one or both of these sub jects raigbt increase the genera! pros perity, but he urges the dangers which may attend experiments in such com plex matters. lie thinks tlist we are getting along very nicely as lt is, and expresses the opinion that it will pay to let well enough alone. Stability he re gards as the most important feature to be sought for in our national finances, and he counts it wiser to adhere to an objectionable system than to upset pub lic confidence by radical steps, the out come of which cannot be accurately pre dicted. The usual summary of the work of the various branches of the government takes a good deal of space, and discloses nothing which can gratify by its novelty or excite adverse comment because of the rashness of its recommendations. In conclusion he refers to the evils of gerrymandering, which he finds to be a popular fad of contemporary legisla tures, and he particularly deprecates movements for the division of a state's electoral vote, like that perfected in Michigan, the" effect of which is not likely to contribute to the success of the Republican party. The Lodge bill, now fortunately dead beyond the pos sibility of immediate resurrection, re ceives a spirited defense at the end, along with a reminder of the solemnity which attaches to a seat in the United States congress. Only one man has oc cupied the White house since the civil war who was capable of imparting a tone of elevation and "effectiveness to his state papers, and he was Grovek Cleveland. Men read his messages because they repaid perusal, and re membered them because they abounded in sententious phrases which lodged (irmly la the popular mind. Mr. Har bison* does not and cannot rise above the dull level of a sodden partisanship, and his present effort can be dismissed as a dignified presentation of the pre vailing Republican doctrines, from which the voters of this country have now at two elections expressed the most unequivocal dissent. 

SUNRISE SIGNALS. The New Year commences on Friday. It promises to be unlucky— fur the Republican party. * * m Friends of John L. Sullivan are consider ing the advisibility of placing him under Dr. Keeley's care. This seems a sad waste of bichloride of gold. * » As truth is stranger than fiction, so un conscious humor is more humorous than the patent, machine-made variety. The ex change editor of the Chicago Evening Post culls with the deft shears of an expert the following rare excerpts from some of the young but ambitious weeklies which are, in reality, the sturdy pioneers of Western jour nalism: SPIRIT OP the RURAL PRESS. - As we go to press it is snowing a gale. Martin ttaghraoe, of Pleasant Valley, has beeu courting here this week. Etta .1. Smith, the abstracter, has erected a very neat sign in front of her office. Guy Preuitt has discontinued his studies with Mrs. Greeuleaf on account of trouble with his eyes. Thanksgiving was Labor day In this office, but a good turkey dinner helped materially to carry us through all right. The editor was presented with an apple last week taken from a tree on the Harrison farm, it was of the Romanite variety, and was large and excellent. As we write southeasterly winds winds an playing havoc with the snow and, sleighing, but we are in hopes that more snow will fall, so that the young man and his "best girl" may not be disappointed about their sleigh ride. A Lovely Damsel, passing through the Room of Her eider Brother, saw a 3S-caliber Car tridge and a Hull Dog Revolver lying on a table Side by Side. Pausing for an Instant, the Lovely Damsel pensively addressed the Cartridge as follows: "Excuse me— lint— cau You give mc an Idea of the internal Mechan ism of that Bull Dog Revolver?" Upon this the Cartridge spoke in a sharp. Percussine Voice: "My dear Young lady, really I cannot Impart the desired information; I am Not in It." Dom Pedro was a good emperor living in an exceedingly bad period for emperors. Even poor Tom Reed got a "place" in the speakership race. Death won in the game of Pedro. *• What the Republican papers do not know about the "issues involved in the speakership contest" amounts to very little, anyway. The quadrennial attack of big head to which the Republican party is painfully subject has made its appearance unusually early in the campaign. PBMMBMIffjjMtaISB More than one professional politician in Chicago has had occasion to acknowledge the wonderful versatility of Carter H. Har rison; His political versatility has never been questioned. In his capacity as editor and proprietor of the Chicago Times Mr. Harrison jumps into the ring with ■ new, novel and startling innovation upon old time journal ism, which indirectly stamps him as one of the most versatile and accomplished editors of this or any other ? age.. • lie reduces dry market reports to the jingling, rhythmic ca dences of rhyme. He brings in .'change and poetically idealizes and ■ etherealizet the flue tuationsof the. market in a manner, which prove him a master of idyllic composition. Listen to the weird .melody of the "market harp when Carter sweeps the strings: "Corn has been bobbing up and down -"• In a manner decidedly frisfiy. It's a shame to employ for the bulls' and bears' ioy SsS Good grain that makes excellent whisky." THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: THURSDAY MORNING. DECEMBER {6. 1891. HOMILIES AT HOTELS. Hon. W. F. Kelso, tho bonanza farmer of Kittson county, is. in the city looking after some business mailers. This is his first visit to St. Paul since last July, and he will remain for several days. Although comparatively a young man, Mr. Kelso is one of the few men who have had a chance to go to congress and refused it A little over a year ago the farmers of the Fifth district met in conven tion in Fergus Falls, and. after looking over the field, offered Mr. Kelso their nomination for representative. He declined because of his business, which demanded all of his time, and ihe honor was given Hon. Klttel Halvorsen, of Steams ' county, who is now representing the district at Washington. Had Mr. Kelso taken this nomination he would also have been made the Democratic nominee, and his majority would have been as large as those the district was accustomed to give ex-Congressman Knute Nelson. But Mr. Kelso is not grieving over the situation at all. aud in fact feels decidedly good over the results of the past season's crops. He finished threshing some time ago, and when all the returns were la he he found that he had nearly 50,003 bushels of wheat, nearly all of which is of the highest grade. "I think we were very fortunate," said Mr. Kelso, -in getting our threshing done, con sidering the weather. The crop was a fine one, and in the Eed river valley we have only one complaint to make, and it is that the weather prevented us doing the usual amount of plowing for the next crops. This will necessitate a great deal of spring work. If the spring opens early this will not be a serious matter, but if it happens to commence late it will serve to decrease the acreage next year." Mr. Kelso is, of course, anxious to see St, Paul secure tha Democratic national con vention and thinks her chances are away up. Before locating in Minnesota Mr. Kelso was one of the Democratic leaders in. Michigan fend is well acquainted with the leaders there, and he thinks that when Detroit rinds she cannot secure tbe pi ize her support will be thrown to St. Paul. The fact that the Re publicans will meet in Minneapolis ought to make the success of St Paul almost certain. Mr. Kelso thinks. "If the Republicans,'* he said, "consider It good politics to more upon the Northwest it seems to me that the same consideration would apply In the case of the Democrats. The Democratic gains in the Northwest in the past few years have been phenomenal ana everything ought to be done to encour age this growth." Hon. Henry Fei?. Kandiyohi's representa tive in the lower house of the state legisla ture, was in the city yesterday, attending a meeting of the board of audit of the state fair association. Mr. Feig reports that the three principal towns of his county have raised Kandiyohi's proportion of the extra 5100,000 demanded by the world's fair com mission. These towns are Willmar, Atwater aod New London. Mr. Feig, however, does not like this way of raising the money, and is sorry that more time was not given. "Nad they waited a few days," said he, "a call would have been issued for a meeting to apportion the amount among the towns of the county In proportion to the assessed val uation of each, and then I favored making a donation and thus remove the matter from politics. As it is, the question of passing a bill appropriating §101,000 to reimburse the men who guarantee this money will be car ried into the legislative contests next year, and will cause no end of trouble. For this reason I think the money should have been raised by subscription. The share of my township would have been but 540, and I would have guaranteed to raise It in dollar subscriptions." BJitorW. M. Fuller, of Little Falls, was a prominent figure ia tha Merchants' lobby yesterday. Mr. Fuller, besides editing aud publishing tli3 Transcript, is postmaster of Little Falls and a stockholder in the water and electric light works of the city. Id the campaign of 18SS he was secretary of tho Re publican congressional committee of the Fifth district add did a great deal towards electing ex-Congressman Comstock. Edilor Fuller, while not a boomer, believes that Little Falls ha 3 a great, future ahead of it, and is not slow to enumerate its advantages. Hon. 11. C. Bull, of Cokato. was a promi nent member of the last legislature in the city yesterday. Mr. Bull Is so interested in the success of St. Paul iv the contest for the Democratic convention that he decided to eomelo the city, aud learn just how the thing stands. Be spent the day in "chatting wit!: friends and acquaintances, and relumed home to Wright county well satisdad over the outlook. M. W.

Tomorrow opens the seat sale at Dyer Bros, for the concerts of the Austrian Juvenile band to be given at the People's church Wednesday and Thursday of next week. Scarce ever has come such universal com mendation of any band as reaches us in the criticisms of the Boston. Philadelphia and other newspapers concerning the wonderful playing of this baud. It consists of forty boys between the ages of fourteen and twen ty, and the marvel of it is that it challenges comparison with any band of adults In this or any other country, and the critics bear it out in its claim. It plays every variety of classical, light, and danpe— its capacity for entertaining an audience by the great variety and charm of its work creates the greatest enthusiasm everywhere. To miss these concerts would be a grave mis take on the part of any music lover of these two cities. Abraham Backer Dead.

Valparaiso, Chili, Dec. 9.— The sub stance of President Harrison's state ment of Chilian affairs was received today and is a subject- of uni versal comment. It is regarded by the Chilians as decidedly menacing a rupture between the two countries, as it is not believed that the Chilian gov ernment will consent either to apology or any material indemnity. The ma jority in congress is known to be op posed to any concession, and the Chillian government, although pos sessed of great influence, would dud it difficult to carry the neces sary support for any humiliating meas ures. It is now no secret that the gov ernment is proceeding actively with warlike preparations, and that artillery of the latest manufacture lias been or dered from Germany in anticipation of hostilities possibly with other powers, and probably with the United State*. The situation is complicated by Spaing demand for a large indemnity. Beer Boycott Off.

JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT. The Big English Mining Syndicate ' Has a Bill to Settle.. Judgments were taken in the district court yesterday against the Iron and Land Company of Minnesota in the ag gregate sum of $831,479.15. This com pany is a corporation of "Great Britain that purchased extensive tracts of mineral and timber lands in the north ern part of the state. In the summer of ISSOthe company issued debentures in large numbers, dated Aug. I of that year and payable in ten years with interest payable semi-annu ally at 7 per cent. The debentures were for £50 each and were payable the London & Westminister bank at Lath burg. London. They were put on the market by the English company, and a number of them found their way into the hands of St. Paul men. The attor ney for the concern in St. Paul was Homer C. Eller. The lands In St.Louis 'and other counties of the northern part of the state which were purchased by thejcorporatlon are enhancing in value , and are destined to be almost of fab ulous worth. It came to the ears of local owners of the debentures that the English contingent were maknig a move towards protecting their interests by a foreclosure of securities. This was about six weeks ago. The St. Paul men then made a side move to protect their investments by bringing suits with attachments upon the land. These attachments were served upon Emil Huntman, a local director in the com pany, the latter part of October, and yesterday judgments were entered by default in Clerk O'Connor's office for the amounts claimed with interest These judgments are in the name of the persons in the amounts named, as follows: Albert Scheffer, $754,734.50; James W. Wright, §57,375.42: Percival Fowler et al., 515.597.33: Homer C. Eller et aL $377.90. The amount of Mr. Eller is for legal services for two years, the others own debentures. The corpora tion has as yet made no answer to the complaints filed, and it is probable a contest will grow out of the action taken by the St. Paul people. FORGING TO THE FRONT. The Chamber of Commerce and the Auditorium Scheme. A delegation of market gardeners yesterday waited upon the chamber of commerce while in session. As a result of their talk, H. F. Stevens had the fol lowing resolution adopted: Kesolved, That a special committee ot three be appointed by the president to inves tigate as to the advisability of a wholesale market for market gardeners; that if the committee find that such a market is advis able, som9 plan for its establishment and maintenance be submitted. The auditorium scheme also came up for discussion, out of the following reso lution introduced by Gen. U. C. An drews: Resolved, That we approve the action of the city council for changing the market house into an auditorium, and would strong ly urge that said auditorium be thoroughly fire-proof. W. Pitt Murray urged the Smith park site in preference to the market house, as did T. lieardon, who said there was an old report somewhere that con demned the old market house.

In order to make out 'that a creditor has reasonable cause to believe his -debtor insolvent, knowledge must be shown of some fact or facts calculated to produce a reasonable belief that the latter it insolvent, and if such facts are known to the creditor as are sufficient to put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry, he is j chargeable with the knowledge which such inquiry would have furnished him. Held that the finding of the court below that these plaintiffs had reasonable cause to believe their debtor's insolvency when taking a mortgage upon his personal property was juslified by the evidence.

ARBITRARY POWER. State World's Fair Boards in Dan- ger of Having It. Chicago, 'Dee. 9.— Thirty-one state world's fair organizations were repre sented in the convention called to meet today with the board of control, the de partment chiefs and the directors of the exposition. Fully 150 were present, about half of tbem being women delegates from the state boards. M. 11. De Young, T. W. Massey and Judges St. Clair, Lindsay and Martin dale represented the board of control. The proceedings had not gone far before President Baker, of the local directory, in respouse to an invitation from Presi dent Palmer to address the meeting, made a speech that seemingly compli cates the relations between" the state boards and the national commission, and may lead to lively times in the conven tion. After complimenting his audience he said: "The object of this convention is to secure the co-operation of the state boards in dealing with exhibitors. To do this effectively, the state organiza tions must secure authority from the board of control. It is difficult to deal with exhibitors from the states through the departments of the world's fair. There must be no discrimination in the selection of exhibits and the department chiefs cannot judge of a display in a distant state or discrimin ate between exhibitors, because they have no means of judging. The remedy for this would lie in regulations agreed upon, by the board of control and your selves, directing all publications for space from states to come through the state board and vesting the state author ities with the p..\ver of discrimination as to exhibits." The national commission and its board alone have heretofore had control of applications for space' and installa tion of exhibits. President Baker's speech apparently conveyed to the dele gates the impression that they would now be given power in their respective jurisdictions practically to say who should exhibit and who not. Delegate Graves, of Wisconsin, at once intro duced the following: Resolved, That it is the sense of this con ference that all applications for space from exhibitors residing in the United States be n-a«e to the several state boards direct and by them forwarded to the director general; and that no allotment of space to individual or corporate exhibitors be finally awarded without the approval ofthe state from which such application is filed. The resolution was laid over until to morrow, and from indications will give rise to a lively discussion. — . . A 

SHOCKING STORY. From a Mansion to a Brothel in a Day. Milwaukee, Wis., Dec. 9.— The story of the downfall of Mrs. Florence Miller will shock the society circles of Mil waukee. Monday Mrs. Miller was surrounded with all the luxuries of a marble mansion, that of her grand father, the late J. B. Martin, who was before his death some years ago one of • Milwaukee's most prominent residents. Last night Mrs. Miller was an inmate of a Wells street resort. She is the daugh ter of the Countess Sigardi. the mar riage of her mother to the Count Sigardi in London but little more than a year ago. At present the Count and Count ess Sigarda are at their home in Italy. Florence's mother was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Martin and her first husband was Sidney Cooper, who was United States consul to Italy. While living with her "parents in Washington Florence^Cooper, then a girl of not more than fifteen, attained notoriety by publicly horsewhipping United States Senator Ferry. Within a year afterwards Florence married William Miller, a wealthy young Eng lishman. For years they lived happily together, but about four years aso her husband became shift less, since which time she has been obliged to depend more or lesson •her relatives for support. Since her marriage Mrs. Miller has been a fre quent visitor to Milwaukee, and has al ways been received into the best of so ciety. She was a regular attendant at church up to Sunday last. Monday afternoon Mrs. Miller "left her grand mother's home, and her whereabouts were unknown until she was found to day by detectives. 

HANKINS MUST CLOSE. Garfield Track Under the Ban of the Authorities. Chicago. Dec. 9.— A war of exter mination by the public authorities has at last been inaugurated against the in stitution known as the "Garfield Park track." The place, though ostensibly a regular jockey club's course, is, accord ing to a general belief, largely owned by George Ilankins, who. until the ad vent here of a city administration op posed to rambling, conducted one of the largest houses in the West. Soon after the forced shut-down of the faro dens, control of the old West side track was purchased. It was at once refitted for business, and when cold weather began the grand stand and bookmakers' quarters were closed in with glass and steam pipes put in. From that time the horses havo been going around in the rain and snow. Whether in fear of rapidly rising public indignation or because the re ceipts of the betting ring were dimin ishing or for what reason, the managers an pounced the cessation from the be ginning of next week until spring. The West side park commissioners, whose authority is derived direct from the state of Illinois, decided to close up the piace, and last night, in order to settle their jurisdiction, adopted a resolution instructing the park police to "prohibit, forbid ami abate all horse racing and gambling" within, specified limits, which include the site of the alleged race track.
