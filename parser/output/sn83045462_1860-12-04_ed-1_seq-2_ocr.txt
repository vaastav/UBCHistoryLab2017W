THE BVEMNG STAR. WASHINGTON CITY: TI MOA* ...DffraNr I.1M*. ( ? t Spirit ( the m*ratac The Constiim;i?w questions wbethet the Hoi- ' perites of the present Congress have become suf- j flcirntly entfjfhtenrd as to the actual tendency of , events to be willing to acknowledge their own i responsibility for the perilous situation of affair?, aiid to evince an h<me?t d?*sire to apply ?uch remedies ns still r-miin in tbelr power to offer. Tk> t.xUMor is devoted to Congressional prrcttdingi and newt. Tlf >1 The reading of tbe President's Annual Metwr; created an Intense sensation to day In the House. vrhU b never before looked so liko what It was designed for?a deliberative assembly. Every member was apparently in hts seat. listening with dignity, decorum, and breathless attention. The e*m n ?Kt tK? !n fi*rMnn ft Ufa ?CI lt?, iWj ?UU?J V?U^U< 1UV a glorious sigh!, Indeed. One might have almost dreamed that the fathers of the Repuollc again occupy for the nonce the high places that now know them no more. The portion treating of secession formed the topic of this Intense interest It proved to be what might have been expected from President Buchanan's public history aad well known views upon the point In IsMie. While showing that the Union is already practically dismembered by an effort of douth CaroUaa to secede, he disproves the soundness of the pleas upon which the right of secession Is based?showing that It is naked revolution and nothing else. At ice tame ntw ne ucaiouiuiu* mtu mivc the utter impolicy of attempting to cure the difficulty by measures of coercion. He pledges himself to the execution of tbe law* by the exerc !?e of all tbe power* of the Government really at bis command, and shows that without prompt action by Congress those powers will be of no avail in the emergency. The paper (message) Is destined to form a landmarc In tbe history of American public affairs; insomuch as it will at once become tbe platform upon wnica an conservative ana reany unionloving men of tbe land must necessarily, aa they will gladly, rally In this most momentous contest In which our country ever became Involved. ttxromakt a?id Partial Sc?r?*sio!i o? Patmest by thk tpk\?rkt of ths united statks it Is no longer to he disguised that the Treasury of the 1' S is already in such condition from want of funds that by direction of his superrlorin office, the Treasurer here is compelled to decline paying requisitions upon him for tbe Government's cur rent expenses?paying at sight only such as must be so paid to insure the continued transaction of tbe public business. and withholding payment of the balance until the Treasury may have more means at command at the great centers of trade. We hear of very heavy amounts in requisitions on various accounts thus held over at the Department, involving, among other things, the nonpayment of the wages of sailors. So, too, has the Treasurer been forced to decline according to the officers of Congress at this time sufficient to liquidate tbe dues to tbe members of the body. The truth is, the anticipation of secession?in diminishing the revnue most extraordinarily?has caused the Government thus temporarily to sus pend the payment or much of what irowc#, and could liquidate in ordinary times. Thi Great Socthwzstkrx Chaim or Kaileoadi.?The great southwestern route through Virginia and Tennessee, known as the Virginia and Tennessee route, Is now making the time advertised on their bills (three days) between the cities of Washington and New Orleans. This line offers many advantages, namely: the cheapnnu r\f fart* ihnrtnhdi nf da r?r ki ncr of >agga?e, few changes, all of which are made without ttouble to the passei.ger, the roads connecting at the same depot, thus protecting the travele* from exposure to the weather. Thi? line is now checking baggage from Washington and points north to New Orleans. First-class sieepi ng can are used on all night trains. The scenery with which this route is adorned is charming, and well repays the expenditure of travel. The time Is twenty-four hour* leas, and distance two hundred m'lea shorter than any other route. The great U. 8. mail and Adams' express are carried over this route. We give the above notice that travelers may secure the advantages ottered by ?kl. wA I 11 A 1 ItV *1 ivuic. i uk jjeaiirmen conutciw who 111c road as agent*. conductor*, baggage master*, etc , re well posted la their dotiea, and have an eye to the comfort of passengers. What Will Be Done With It??We have heard of fourteen different schemes for disposing of the portion of the Annual Message treating of secession, to be sent to Congress to-day?only fi)iirt?k#n in far ' TK? m?inin? nf *11 im tKai aa yet no concert of purpose has been arrived at by any cooaiderable number of membera. The plan that meets moat favor, so far, la to refer It (in the House) to a committee of one Repreaentatlve from each State, to be selected by the State's delegstlon. To this It will probably be endeavored to append a further proposition instructing that committee to report amendments to the Constitution to cure the disabilities of which the South complain We question much whether any such provision will pass the House just now. sincerely aa we desire prompt legislation to that end; as it will at least require the exposition of debate to ?pen the eyes of the Republican party of Congress to the fact that the continuance of the South in the Union depends wholiy upon giving her additional constitutional guarantees. Ssnsaiiox Rumors?We have every reason to believe that there Is no truth In the story from this city, published la yesterday's New York Hitaid, saying that on Saturday last Secretary Cobb resigned, to take effect on Wednesday next. Ilia family arc preparing to return home immediately, but we know nothing to Induce the belief that M r Co'ob himself designs following them so long a?
