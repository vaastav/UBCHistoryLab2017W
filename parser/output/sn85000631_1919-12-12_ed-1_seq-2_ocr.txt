SOLONS HAVE TAX REDUCTION PLAN Would Arbitrarily Cut 1919 As sessment 25 Per Cent by Bill Just Introduced. START LIBRARY PROBE Charges by Burtness of Grand Forks Stir Up Feeling—Committee In vestigating Character of Traveling Libraries. Bismarck, N, D., Dec. 8.—State taxes for this year may be cut 25 per cent as the result of a bill introduced In the house Saturday. Explaining that several of the state industries are now self supporting and no longer need money and are in a position to refund to the state treasury all moneys ap propriated for their operation, and that there has been .a partial crop failure in all parts of the state, the bill says: "The amount due from each tax payer of this state for the year 1919 for state taxes is hereby remitted in the amount of 25 per cent thereof and such taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund of such amount." The bill carries an emergency clause and will have the support of the Non partisan league majority in both houses, it is said. Solons Start Library Quiz Bismarck, N. D.—Outstanding in the attention it attracted in the public press throughout the state the past week, among the proceedings of the legislature, was the appointment by the house of a committee to Investi gate charges made by Representative Burtness that the state library, under direction of Dr. C. E. Stangeland, an appointee of the board of administra tion, was sending out books of ques tionable character In its traveling li braries issued to country communities and rural schools. Representative Burtness cited volumes said to have been found in these libraries, explain ing that certain of them contained radical propaganda on the subjects of socialism and "free love." A distinct sensation was produced in the house by the representative's charges, one of the floor leaders of the league forces having expressed the opinion that If these statements were true the situa tion should be corrected at any cost of power to the board Under whose control this work was done. Upon the motion of Representative O'Connor, a minority member, a com mittee of five was appointed by the speaker to investigate the charges made and the bommlttee has since been at work behind-closed doors, the minority members' vote in the commit tee to have the proceedings made pub lic having been ruled down. Toward the close of the week, another tacti cal defeat was sustained by the min ority members in the refusal of the majority to comply with their request that the findings of the committee be at once reported back to the house. These members, it Is said, thought, the committee had already completed all points of investigation required by its Instructions, but majority members In sisted on continuing the hearing. At this writing It seems uncertain whe ther the findings of the committee will be presented to the legislature for con sideration before It adjourns. Determined to "discipline" Attorney General William Langerfor activities considered detrimental to the adminis tration, the legislature has finally passed senate bill No. 4, repealing an act passed last winter by which the attorney general was empowered to appoint special assistants. House bill No. 13, providing that the governor shall have power to appoint such assistant' attorneys general has been passed by the house and mes saged to the senate for consideration. Bills are also under consideration which, If passed, will remove the state auditor from the auditing board and from the state emergency commission, a body paving control' of- funds which may be required for special funds. Senator D. J. Belsel, the hew mem ber from Towner county,, was seated early in the week. The house killed a bill requiring publication of reports of the Bank of North Dakota. A bill providing for the licensing of the sale of clgarets was killed by the house, then reconsidered and referred to the temperance committee for fur ther amendment. The lower bofly. passed a measure providing $25,000 appropriation for the maintenance and expenses of a legis lative "smelling committee" to Inves tigate charges of disloyalty to state Interests which may be made against officials or other citizens of whose ^actions the committee, may deem It proper to take note.
