Tlio scono Is placed, just following tho revolution, In Cnrrlng ton castto In England. Tho Carringtons, after n house party, engaged in a family tilt, caused by Jealousy. Lord Carrlng ton and his wlfo each made charges of faithlessness against tho other In con tinuation of tho quarrel. First objecting against playing cards with tho miosis, I.udy Carrington agreed to cut cards with Lord Strathgato, whoso attentions to Kllon had become a soro point with Car rington. The loss of $100,000 failed to per turb her. and lier husband then out for his wife's I. n V and bw honor. Car rliiKton winning. Tlio Incident closed ex cept that a lilting for eucli other appar ently arose between Lady Carrington and Lord Stratlm-ate. Additional attentions of Lord Carrington to Lady Cecily nnd Lord Strathgate to Lady Carrington com pelled tho latter to vow that slio would lcavo the castle. Preparing to line, Lady Carrington nnd her chum Deborah, an American girl, met Lord Strathgate nt two a. in., ho agreeing to see them sifo ly nway. Kllen lied. Strathgato driving. tin attempted to tnko her to his castle, but sho left him stunned in tlio road when tho carriage met with an accident. Sho nnd Debblo then struck out for Portsmouth, where sho intended to sail for America. Hearing nows of Ellen's tllght. Lords Carrington and Seton set out in pursuit. Seton. locating a fish ing village, hit tlio trail of Kllen ami Debbie. Ho then rented a fast vessel and started In pursuit. Carrington pur suing Strathgato. Strathg.ito, bleeding from fall, dashed on to Portsmouth, for which Carrington. Kllen and Seton were also headed by different routes. CHAPTER X. The Bewilderment of Strathgate. As my Lord Carrington rodo with Increasing satisfaction and Sir Charles Seton sailed In a growing sense of self-congratulation In that ho alone was on tho right track, my lord of Strathgato was full of bowildor nient. Liko Carrington. ho. too, mado inquiries at every posting station, at evory wayside Inn, from every passer by, as to the whereabouts of the two who had escaped him, and everywhere ho had been met by nn absoluto lack of information. Strathgato, by hard riding, roadbed Portsmouth nbout nightfall. Carring ton was not to arrive, although ho pressed on all night, until tho follow ing morning. Strathgato was morally certain that tho people ho was chas ing could not have reached Ports mouth before him. Therefore, although ho had been up all the night before nnd wanted sloop badly, ho determined to make somo inquiries before he went to bed Ho found, to his great surprise, that tho Now Eagle, which was tho name of the ship owned by tho countess of Carrington, had sailed that morning. So far fortune favored him. for Iady Ellen would arrive at Portsmouth, ho thought, and find her ship gone. Ho enlisted tlio service of tho land lord nnd secured a numbor of men whom ho poBted at the various Inns, with Instructions to notify him Im mediately In caso Ellon and Deborah arrived. Carrington, plunging along on ex hausted, half-foundered horses, tho leavings of Strathgato, lost tho com parative cheerfulness of tho morning nnd worked himself up Into such a fury that It ho had como across tho earl ho would probably havo killed him out of hand without giving him a chanco for defense. The only ono thoroughly satisfied with tho situation was Seton, and oven his dash eastward was stopped, for tlio wind, which had hold briskly for the greater part of tho day, died out about nightfall and left tho gallant captain helplessly tossing In tho short waves of tho channel. To hearten up her young friend, Ellen put a bravo foco upon tho wholo matter. Sho pointed out to hor how comfortable and freo from pursuit, or Interference, they would bo when thoy hoarded tho Now Eagle at Portsmouth; what a pleasant vo'yago thoy would havo back; and mndo various othor suggestions to cheer her young com rado and lo fight down tho growing dls may In hor own heart, it was only by constantly holding up before hersolt tho plcturo of my lord and Lady Cecily In each other's arms in tho arbor that sho kept horsolt to tho pitch of her ndventuro. Sho found herself thinking wistfully of tho happy days of tho past; of tho many ploasant cruises which thoy had mado In theso very wators. What a gallant, devoted, roynl lover ho had been! How sho hated Cecily Carring ton! Sho looked nt; horself and took a mental inventory of that Bho could not see and wondered how ho could for a moment prefer that weak and vapid creature to his wlfo. And yet It is probable that Ellen had never loved Carrington as Bho did whllo tossing nbout In that llttlo open boat, a lonely Bpeck upon tho sea, munching dry hard bread and drink ing tepid water and trying to console tho whimpering llttlo maiden by her sldo. And It Is possible, too, that Lord Carrington never realized how much ho was In Imminent danger of losing and how much tho loss meant to him ns ho plunged along through tho dark ness ou tho way to Portsmouth. Ellen had advanced much farther on her Journey when sho ran Into tho calm which later overtook Seton. All Ellen's ready mono, ext.. tu what sho carried ou' her person, had been left to Carrlrfgton In tho chequo on her deak, but sho still retained con trol of several stout merchantmen which had como to her from her father and tho Now Eaglo was tho best of them. Oner sho set foot on tho docks of Hint Whip? Mm would bo perfectly safe. Meanwhile, ns sho had been up practically all tho night before, Bho felt that sho must havo somo slumber. Sho furled tho salt of tho llttlo boat, turned tho tiller over to Dobblo with Instructions for hor to lot tho shallop drift and to waken Ellen In two hours by tho watch. It was very lonely and mlsorablo for poor Debbie. She was flying llko Ellon from that sho loved best, but unlike Ellon thero was no reason on earth for hor to break away. It was only the constraint put upon her by tho stronger will that had brought hor to this wretched pass. Sho sat Idly in tho stern sheets, holding tho tiller, whllo tho tears trickled down hor pretty red cheeks. Sho wished that sho wero anywhere else under heaven than In this boat. She looked at Ellen almost malevolently, surveying hor Hllght and boyish figure with a venomous glanco and tho thought that since clothes of tho othor sex bo well becamo her, Ellen should havo been born a man. Poor Debbie felt very wretched and very lonely tossing idly about In tho quiet seas under the calm stars. Sho wondered If Sir Charles did renlly love her as sho had more than onco indi cated, or whether ho wero like tho faithless Carrington and the insidious Strathgato. Tliro was nothing to do except to look out for passing vessels and sho had plenty of time for silent thought about her pa3t, her present and her future. 

CHAPTER XI. The Mad Chase. Lord Strathgato was early abroad, which proves tho keenness of his In terest In the chase. His agents re ported to him at dayhrenk, but had no news of their quest. No ono remote ly resembling tho fugitives had been seen during tho night Although ho "Am I Your Wife's Keeper?" had breakfasted and day had scarce ly dawned, Strathgato could not re main Idle. Instinctively his foot stops turned toward tho strand. If Ellen had arrived during tho night, sho would probably have sought tho harbor at once. Although tho New Eaglo had sailed, as sho would find to her dismay, thero woro other ships In tho harbor and upon ono of those sho might havo taken refuge. Even though It was yot early, thero was plenty of stir along tho sea wall, and Strathgato mlnglod with tho fishermen, boatmen, sailors and pilots busy about their various tasks. Hy tho judicious exiiendituro of shillings and sixpences, ho oponed tho most stubborn mouths. Rut no ono had seen tho missing pair. After a half hour's investigation, he was about to glvo It up as a hopeless task and return to tho Inn, when as a last venture ho put his question to a young fisherman, tho latest comer to tho wharf. "Yes, yer honor," replied tho man, "I think there wns a man and a wom an, or a young girl among tho passen gers which my brothor, who owns a wherry, put aboard a ship llko yon Flying Star. Into last night." Tho woman happened to bu the captain's wife, and the young man waB tho supercargo of tho Hhlp, and tho ship happened to bo another ship, and not tho Flying Star tit all; but of that of course neithor Strathgato nor his Informant had any knowledgo. The earl's Intcrost was at onco awak ened, "What Bhlp did you say that was?" ho hsked. "Tho Flying Star, I think 'twas called, though I'm no ways certain, yor honor." "Whoso ship wns sho? Of what na tlonallty, that Is?" "Sho's an American merchantman, sir," roturnod tho sailor, whose nnmo was Cooper. "And whore doos she He?" "She doesn't lie nowhoro," answered another sailor. Rurvovlns tho harbor. "lcastwayn her berth was tlere near est tho warships" ho pt nted o.T toward Admiral Kephard's loot of grim war monsters swlnginr ea3l,y it their anchors In tlio strong bb "but sho's gone now." "Sho got under way at daybreak fids morning," said a bystander; ' yon der alio la.' Ho pointed down t'io harbor at a ship under full sail rapid ly working toward the channel. "Who has the fastest boat in the harbor?" cried Strathgate with sud den resolution. "I havo, yer honor," answerct Cooper. And nlthough his claim was voclfer ously disputed by a doi.cn mon who crowded around Strathgato, -who rath er liked, ho ajipe&.ranco of tho man, plJol'ttWlpuy hiui .fpr .liia,purposc. "A hundred pounds to you," ho cried loudly, "If you put mo on board tho Flying Star boforo sho gets out of the harbor." "I'd llko to see the color ,of yer money, yor honor, beggln' yer par don," said Cooper. Strathgate pulled out a full purse aJ passed him a ten-pound note. "This for earnest money," ho said. "Now hasten!" "I'll want a hnnd to help me with tho sails," said Cooper, full of excito ment ' "Five pounds to the man that goes, if wo win. I'm the earl of Strath gato." "Yes, your lordship." "Take mo, Cooper!" "I'll go!" cried ono anil another. Cooper quickly selected his man, choosing one of tho lightest and most agllo of tho applicants. "Into tho boat with you!" cried Strathgato as soon as tho mattor was settled. Now that ho had mado up his mind, he was eager to bo off. Ho did not know whero Ellen was. Ho had no assurance that sho was on that ship, but at any rato it was a posslblo clew, and anything was better than passing tho day in idleness at Portsmouth. Perhaps Ellen had como in in somo way during tho night. Stop! It sud denly flashed into his miud that she might have como by sea. There would havo been plenty of tlmo, f sho had gotten a boat, anywhere near tho place whero the carriage was wrecked. This made him the moro impatient and anxious to get away. Fired by tho splendid reward for success, Cooper and his man worked doublo tides and soon had tho sall3 hoisted and tho boat ready for de parture. "Will yer honor como pow?" "Immediate)'," cried t3trath(yatei "Wo haven't a moment to lose, your lordship," returned Cooper. "Thoso Yankees aro swift footers and it'll be nip and tuck If wo overhaul her." Strathgato sprang Into tho boat nnd Cooper shoved off. Tho boom swung out to leeward nnd tho call of tho cutter filled. She was In tho lee of the wharf, however, and was moving very slowly whon n horseman camo galloping down to tho strand at full speed. Hl3 sorry steed was com pletely blown. The rider dropped tho reins on tho horso's neck, sprang to tho ground and ran out on tho wharf, attracted thereto by tho crowd of peo plo watching the departuro of Strath gato. As ho ran, ho shouted; "Can nny of you toll mo anything about tho New Eaglo?" "Ay, master," answered ono of the boatmen, "she sailed yesterday morn ing for Philadelphia." "Yesterday morning?" "Ay, yer honor." "What ship la that?" continued Car rlniron, peering straight down tho har bor. "Sho looks like an American." He was vlowlng hor with the eye of sailorly experience. " 'TIs nn American," answered an other, "that bo tho Yankee clipper, Flying Star." "Whon did she sail?" "This morning nt daybreak." "Whero Is " At that moment Carrlngton's eye comprehended tho llttlo cutter gild Ing along tho wharf. He recognize! Strathgato standing up In tho stern sheets with his arms akimbo, an In sulting smile upon his faco. With a muttered oath Carrington In two bounds reached tho sldo of the wharf. Tho boat was Increasing Its speed at overy moment. "Strathgate!" thundored Carrington, "whero Is my ," Ho stopped. "Whera aro the fugitives?" Strathgato laughed Ironically, whllo Carrington with eager eyes searched tho recesses of tho llttlo craft, think ing that Ellen and Deborah would be aboard of her. His relief wus Inox presslblo whon ho found that Strath gato was alono. Yet that did not solvo tho question that roso In his mind. "Whore Is she, I say?" ho thun dered.
