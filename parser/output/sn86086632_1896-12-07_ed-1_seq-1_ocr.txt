FRANK B.LYON, Build a House7 SEESIS TO BE A FACT. McKinley Will Convene Congress in Extra Session. NEWS COMES DIRECT FROM CANTON Btatementa Made by Friend of the rreal- dent-Elect Who Uv .Inst Reached Washington Mark Hanna Inspects the New Library Hulldlng to See If It la a Suitable Place to Hold the Inaugural Hall Congressman Dlngley ou Cuba. Washington, Dec. 7. There Is practi cally no longer any doubt of the In tention of President-elect McKinley to convene the Flfty-flfth congress In ex traordinary session early next spring. There were several arrivals of friends and confidents of Major McKlnley's di rect from Canton Saturday who bring the very positive announcement that a call for a special session, to be con vened a few days after the 4th of March has been decided upon. It is stated by men In a position to known that this decision has been definitely reached by Mr. McKinley since his consultation with Mr. Dlngley, chairman of the committee on ways and means, and Mr. Dlngley had been trusted with the privilege of making known this inten tion at the proper time. Senator Thurston's Conviction. Senator Thurston, one of the latest arrivals from Canton, expressed Sat urday In the most positive terms the conviction that an extra session will be called. The senator was one of the earliest and staunchest supporters of Mr. McKinley and there Is every rea son for believing that his utterance is Dyirru iu u, uegrec, wiuugu me echo.- tor himself declines to say such is the case. "All I can say," he said Satur day, "Is that I have very recently seen Major McKinley, and that I am con vinced a session of the next congress will be called for about the 15th of March. That ought to be satisfactory. I cannot Quote any one, but I do not consider that there Is any doubt on the point." "Shall we have the extra session re gardless of the result of the senatorial elections this winter?" was asked. ri edged to the People. "Yes; the complexion of the senate will not be allowed to Influence the de cision at all. The Republican admin istration has been elected under a pledge to the people to reform the tar iff, and Its duty to this country Is to proceed about that business at the ear liest possible moment and either to keep Its pledge or make it manifest that It Is Impossible to do so. I think we ought to secure a tariff which could be put Into effect by the beginning of the next fiscal year." senator i nursion s.nu ne am noi con- uider tn passage of th pmgiey bin at the snort session as possiuie. MA KK II ANN A IN WASHINGTON. InxpccU the Library Hiiihling for the In augural Hall. Washington, Dec. 7. Hon. M.A.IIan na. rnairman 01 me itrnuuiicaji nauun al committee, accompanied by Hon. H. C. Payne of Wisconsin, arrived In Washington at 7:40 o'clock Saturday morning and went to the Arlington hotel. Mr. Hanna declared that the purpose of his visit was confined, at most, exclusively to the making of preparations for the Inaugural cere monies next March, and to deciding some points in connection with the proposition to remove the headquarters of his committee to Washington, with the view of continuing the work of the committee in preparation for the cam palgn of 19M. His first act was to make an inspec tlon of the new congressolnal library building with a view to Its reception or rejection as the place for the inaugural ball. The eligibility of the building has been strongly urged by those who think the selection of this building would do much to disarm the criticism of those who. on principle, oppose an Inaugural festival. Mr. Hanna was accompanied In his Inspection of the building by Mr. Payne and several other friends. Mr. Payne said, in reply to a question as to the accuracy of the reports con cerning Mr. Hanna's intention to call upon Senator Sherman as the agent, of Mr. McKinley. with the view of offer ing the senator the state department portfolio, that he had no doubt Mr. Hanna would make a social call upon the senator, but that if he should do so, tne lncident need have no special slg- nlflcance. as they were personal and political friends. "I don't believe," said Mr. rayne. "that the personnel of the cabinet will (.a riH.ifd for a month yet. or for a loneer time." Mr. Pavne declined to discuss the re port that he would be a member of McKInley's official nousenom. I) INC. LET ON CUR A. No Radical Action To Re Taken by Thla .Country at Present. Washlngt4n, Dec. Representative Dlngley of Maine reached here from Canton Saturday. He declined to ais- cuss the cabinet question or anything rHatlnir to his visit to Major MCKiniey. He said the Cuban Issue depended upon th information the president might rnnvnv to congress. As far as the pub lic was informed there was nothing new In the situation. Diplomatic ques tions, he said, generally should be left tn the administration and not handled by congress. From what is publicly known about the situation, Mr. Dlng ley said he would Infer that no radical action la to be taken at this time by thla country. He added, however, that there might be important developments and conditions of which the publlo is uninformed. . Chan area In the Nary. wnahlneton. Dec. 7. Captain 0..

Senator Shoup'e Opinion. Washington, Dec. 7. Senator Shoup of Idaho, who reached the city Satur day, expressed the opinion that the passage of the Dlngley revenue bill at the short session of congress was im probable, believing the conditions in the senate to be the same as when the mo tion was made to take up the bill for consideration. The senator thinks therefore that an extra session is likely, although that will have to be deter mined by the Republicans when they get together in conference. iMued a Fraud Order.

MURDER OF MRS. GEDDES. Probability That It Wa Not Her Huaband Who Killed Her. Bloom lngton, Ills., Dec. 7. The the ory that Mrs. Fred Geddes, who was found strangled to death and hanging to a door of her home in Ford county few mornings ago, was killed, not by her husband, but by a stranger, is gaining ground. The murder occurred Just across the line, not far from Anch or, McLean county. Geddes is an ig norant German fram hand, who has enjoyed a good reputation. The little daughter of Geddes, aged 5 years, told that her father killed her mother and Geddes denied the crime. The woman was killed before daybreak, and It Is believed that the child could not have distinguished between her father and any other man, and Geddes said that he had gotten up and gone to the field before daybreak. Children of a neigh bor now say that a strange man ran from the Geddes house Just after day light. This theory accounts for the action of Geddes in insisting, when told of his wife's death, that a Joke was be ing perpetrated on him. FIFTY PASSENGERS HURT.

I "The sit uation is a grave one," said Mr. Cobb, 'and it is difficult to say what the president will do. It Is my opinion. however, that President Cleveland will. In his message to congress, speak kind ly of the Cuban patriots, but will not recommend any action. I don t think he is in favor of taking any positive steps and will leave that to congress."
