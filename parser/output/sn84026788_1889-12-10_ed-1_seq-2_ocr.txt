The Baltimore San, like good wine, needs no praise. To know it is to admire it. It grows better every year, and is constantly strengthening its hold on popular respect. While no pent-up Utica confines its enter grising spirit, it never forgets the in terests or needs of the State in which it is published, and makes the wel fare of Maryland its especial concern. The Washington Star of Tuesday says: Senator Faulkner, of West Virginia, made his first appearance for this session this morning. The Senator moved aronnd by the aid of a crutch. He injured his left leg very seriously about four months ago* and the muscles have not yet knitted themselves into position.?

He entered Transylvania college, but left when "appointed to West Point by President Monroe. He was assigned to the first infantry and took an ac tive part in the Black Hawk war, of 1831-2. He resigned from the army in 1835 after his romantic elopement with the daughter of Xachary Taylor and became a cotton planter near Vicksburg. He was elccted a Rep resentative to Congress in 1845 and took his seat in December of that year, but the following year resigned to become Colonel of the first Missis sippi volunteer rifles. He served throngh the Mexican war with great Credit, being highly complimented for his bravery and coolness in the battle of Ruena Vista, where he was severely wounded. In 1847 he was appointed ?o fill a vacancy in the United States Senate and in the fol lowing year was elected Senator by a unanimous vote of the legislature.? In 18o0he was elected for a full term. In 18J1 he resigned his" seat to take part in the State canfrass and rah for governor on the State rights ticket. He Was defeated, alShotrglr by his popularly he redl-.ced the union ma jority from 7,500 to 999. After the election of Franklin Pierce to the presidency Mr. Davis; who had been one of lus ardent supporters, was ap pointed Secretary of War. At the close of his term of office he again en tered the Senate. In lflflo he made a speech in which he said he would be willing to make any sacrifice in ia order to avert the impending strug gle. In 1861 Mr. Davis made another speech on the State of the country, in which he claimed tile right 'of States to secede and denied the right of coercion. When Mississippi se ceded he started for home, but be fore he reached there he was appointed commander in chief of the army of Mississippi. On February 18, 1861, he exchanged this olflce for that of president of the confederacy. He ? took up his official residence at Rich mond, where soon after his arrival the handsome estate of Mr. James A. Seddon was bought and presented to , him by admiring citizens. Immedi ately after the assassination of Pres ident Lincoln, Mr. Davis and his par ty were captured while encamped at Irwmsville, Ga., by a force of cav alry under command of Lieut. Col. Pritchard. He was indicted for tre son, but on May 13, 1867, he was re leased on ?100,000 bail, the first name on his bail bond being that of Horace Greeley. He was never brought to trial, a nolle prosequi being entered by the government in the case. He was also included in the general amnesty of December, 1868. In 1879 Mrs. Dorsey, of Beauvoir, Miss., be queathed bfm her handsome estate, and he has since lived there in com parative retirement, devoting much of his time to literary pursuits. Mr Davis has one child, Miss Winnie Davis, who has been called the "Child of the Confederacy." She was borrt in Richmond during the war and is a remarkabfy handsome woman.

The important announce ment is made that onr recognition of the Bra zilian republic is to bo deferred until the ma joritv of the people of fita7.il shall have signl led their assent to its establishment.

This actual and prospective excess of receipts requires, says the President, "the attention pf Congress, with a view to reducing tte Y'ecclptt of the triastify To the needs of the government. ? A. reduction of taxation is not urged, as it Is practicable to "reduce receipts" by increas ing tariff taxes to the point of prohibiting im ports that compete with our favored Indus tries. The President does not adopt Mr. Cleveland's phrase. "Unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation." hut puts it more mildly.? "The collection of moneys not needed^Im

Mr. Harrison still condemns, though lie does not tell how, ini de fault of, -'anticipating onr bonds, a dearth ol olrenlation was to be averted. The deposits Still with the banks, after so long an interval, will accordingly, it is announced, be gradually withdrawn. To "reduce receipts." the Presi Jent recommends "a revision of the tariff law. both In iu its administrative fptjtnres and in Its schedules." It does not a'ppcAr tbat he favors a reduction of tariff tuxes. "The inequalities of the law." he says, "should be adjusted, but the protective principle should be maintained.

The specific changes recommended are an ex tension of the free list, by putting oil it clns,e8 of articles not made in this country, and the removal of the internal tax on tobacco and on whlskev used in the arts. With respect to sil ver the'President Is rather non-committal. He afflrins tliat no harm hit*comonf, the .arg| eolna'c of silver dollars since lfcib. but thinks "we should not tread the d ing -rous odgu of thepcril tliat may come of "any considerable increase of the present rate of coinage. ? Upon the whole, liowevei1. Ije I* disposed to think favorably of Secretary wi.-jdoni * P'*n for the issuance id clrtineates upon the de posit of silver bullion at its mar..i-t vaitte. The President is evidently indisposed to ??tread the daugcrous edge,' Iu polities by taUiii"" a decided course on a question liav in" so equivocal a future. He is more ex i,licit!v favorable to a large appropriation for forts, ships end guns and for the improve ment of oiir rivers and hurhors. A few large works at a time is. he thinks, the wiser plan. The question of drastic legislation for the South is approached through a_rc,?,nraInt"iiIot tlon. suggested by the Terrv-Field case that federal officials be withdrawn from ^eJurifdlc tion of the State courts and be tried only in the United States courts.

Such unqnes Fiooablv would be the result of the. iegislatlon the President recommends in a truculent tone for the supervision and control of elections in the South. The colored population of that section, he alles-es. is "deprived "f a,iy -*?0*] five exercise of tlielr political rights and of manv of their civjl rights." This is inferred. It appears, frotn the Iket that the negro of the South does not send Republican representa tives to Congress to support the protective policy. This neglect on his part the president terms a "flagrant evil." calls a "problem' and asks rhetorically "when is he to have those ftlll civil rights which have so long been his in law?"
