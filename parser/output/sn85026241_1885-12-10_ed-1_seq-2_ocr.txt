iSelniont Chronicle W. A. HUNT, EDITOR AND PBOPRIETOB. OIBcet JlaJa CUrett, . Sc H"- Thursday, Dec 10, 1885. The 49ih Cauyress asssmbled on Mon day. Hon. Jubo Sherman of Ohio w elected President pro tempore of the Senate, and John G. Carlisle of Keti tutky. Speakir of the House. At the Republivau Sunaiorial caucus, in Washington. Friday. Gen John A Logan m nnatiimously tendered the lre8ldency of the Senate, but declined the honor, preferring bis place on tbt floor under the circumstance. IT is estimated that the expenses 01 the eovernmejit during the year begin- n nir July 1. will be 825,000,000 ia excess ot the receipts. All under the econom ical financitriugof a Democratic Reform Administration. The Democrats were careful to put forward for a complimentary vote for Tresident pro tempore of the Senate, one r thoir mmt consnieuous rebel charac VI sj- w - ters, who was particularly hateful to ward Union men early in the war the celebrated ex-Governor Isham G. Harris. of Tennessee, Judge Marsh, of Quincy, Illinois, has decided that a woman can not procure a divoroe from her husband on the ground of drunkenness, when she knew at Up time of her marriage that he was drunkard. Should this decision be ac. cepted as good law, it would have th ffact of materiallyreducingthe numbei of divorce petitions on that ground. The Chicago Inter-Ocean, in referring to the disreputable methods being retort ed to by the Coal Oil Democracy of Ohio, to defeat the re-election of Senator Sher man, says: No man can doubt that John Sherman i among the great statesmen of tin United States. No living man could Bll his place in the national councils, aurt his d-feat would dishonor the Republican party ia Ohi. and in every State be re garded as a disaster. Two natural gas explosions occur' red in Pittsburgh during the past week The Drat resulted iu the destruction of a tow boat and the injury of several peo ple. The second occurred on Friday, ud destroyed over 830.000 worth of property. Natural gas is proving a bo nanza to the manufacturing interests of that city, but more safety in its use must be insured, else there is danger of a wil lingness to return to the old days of smoke and soot. . The Gazette becomes a Light House about the time the last Democrat retires from the Board of Commissioners . Un til within the last year, for many yeaw the Democrats have been in the majority in the Board of Commissioners, and if the "waves are already runuing high," they must bear their share of the respon sibility. When the Republican Board of Commissioners fails to transact the pug lie business with fidelity and care, it will be a good time for the Gazette to open its criticism battery. The Senate has dealt admirably with the duty devolved upon it by the Vice President's death. It first offered the place, by the unanimous vote of the re sponsible majority, to the man whom the Republican party chose for it, and who was oLly cheated out of it by the suppression of the Republican vote at the South. Then,when he preferred the more congenial duties of the floor, it has bestowed the honor upon the most experienced and emineut Republican leader in its body. Xo man ques tions John Sherman'a conspicuous ability, or his stalwart fiielity to Re publican principles. The Senate serves the country and honors itself in making Mr Sherman its presiding officer. N Y Tribune. The President's message was deliver ed to Congress on Tuesday. It is a doc ument of unusual length, which would fill about sixteen columns of this paper. Mr Cleveland congratulates the country on the maintenance of peace and unity, with all the peoples of the globe, and follows the lead of President Arthur in giving full consideration to the relations of the United States with the govern ments of foreign nations. He favors the promotion of enterprises to secure rapid transit across the Isthmus of Panama for the benefit of our commerce and the promotion of trade with the South American Republics. He holds noun certain sentiments on the question of Chinese immigration, saying the nation has a right to adopt restrictive meas ures within the limits of treaty stipula tions whenever it is shown that such immigration is inimical to our interests as a people. Concerning the late out breaks and massacres of the Chinese in Wonminiv ami Waahin crton Tftrritnrii'a he holds that they were the work of - aliens, and that the whole power of the Government has been brought into play to secure the arrest and punishment of the guilty parties. He deprecates any action of a nature calculated to interfere with the friendly relations now existing between China and the United Status, and says the treaty regulations must be faithfully and Honorably observed. As regards domestic affairs, the reduction of the tariff is urged as necessary, but the President is careful to say that the question of free trade is not involved nor is the wisdom or expeJieucyof protection called in question. The intention is to try the experiment of reducing the tariff without interfering- with the interests of labor. The President's opinion is that the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from the imported ne cessaries of life, but refrains from de signating any particular articles. Fl advocates such amendments to our ex tradition treaty with Great Britain as will render them more effective in secu ring the arrest and return of a large class of criminals now exempt from its provisions. He also advocates the adop tion of a just and equitable internalion al copyright system, either by legislative enactment or by treaty with foreign: powers. The President, ia theory, still stands by civil service reform. bile the very letter of it is being violated under his very nose. He treats at length on almost every public ques lion, and concludes by urging upon Con gress the importance of making suitable provision for the succession in case of the death or inability of both the Presi dent and Vice President. Running through the message a partisan bias is observed, leaving the average Democrat to conclude that the Republican party has brought the coun try close to the verge of ruin, aud that nothing but Democratic medicine will restore it to its pristine purity. The people of the country will await anx iously the action of the Democraric ma jority out be grave questions with which they are called to battle.

The Gazzette, apparently in pursu ance of a determined purpose to carp at the Republican cenimissioners, under takes to hold Messrs Cope and Berry alone responsible for a certain contract with the Columbus Substructure Co, to build a bridge over McMahon's creek, Belmont street, Bellaire, when Mr Meeban's name is the lirst of the com missioners' name to the contract. The proposed bridge is to be built only after the right of way and perfect title to the necessary approaches is secured by the city authorities of Bellaire, and it is the understanding of the Bridge Co. that no work is to be done or money paid until such right of way is obtained. The Gazette's scarecrow of two lawsuits.need not cause taxpayers to lose any sleep. War, War! War! !
