J We have Congress on our hands ? once more. r ( I The length of the President's mes- o sage also indicates the prevalence of F the expansion idea. ? Mr. Bryan says the Republicans had too much money in the last campaign. They also had too many votes. It is stated that Mr. McKinley's plu- 11 rality of the popular vote is 877,900. It is enough for all practical purposes. Strawberries from California are being sold in the East at a dollar a 1 dozen. The berries are not as large j as the price. s If every peg is to have a hole there ^ will have be a vast increase in offices j, in West Virginia under the next administration. r A glance at Congress will convince a almost anyone that the taxation of the w people is out of ill proportion to their o representation. ^ ii If there is a trust of any sort that f is not getting all that it is entitled to, just let it step up and make known its wants to Congress. t] A Philadelphia man who recently w went into bankruptcy reports asset9 at 1 $25 and liabilities at $2,S31,0S3. He made a pretty complete job of it. t The fact that the increase in our u standing army is to be a permanent one is proof positive that the trouble 0 in the Philippines is also permanent, n The census will give an increased ^ numbei of Congressmen but it is not I likely that there will be more states- I men as a result of our greater popula- e tion. o It is said that the lobbyists in Washington are more numerous than 8 they have been for a long timo and L are well prepared to make things in- c teresting for Congressmen. y, There will be no trouble in get- ^ ting plenty of officers for the proposed p increase in the army, but it is quite g certain that few of the private soldiers t; now in the Philippines will re-enlist. " The Secretarv of the Navv has n - - J * signed the contract for over $16,000,. F 000 worth of armor plate for war ves- v sels now being constructed. Ain't it ^ nice to be a monopoly with a cinch ? E It is said that General Egan, who e had the trouble with embalmed beef, v is to be restored to favor again. It is E stretching matters a trifle to construe t the election as a vindication of Egan r ?but then everything goes these days. 1 Sympathy is one thing and real help is another. President Paul Kruger is getting plenty of the former but t absolutely none of the latter in his tour of Europe. Nations are a good deal like indi- ^ viduals in this respect. t West Virginia has had the office Jof Internal Revenue Commissioner so long that she has come to regard the c place as belonging to her. There are h therefore a number of candidates from this State for the vacancy caused by !; the recent death of Commissioner Wil- J son. j The President wauts an ocean ca- j ble between this country and our ^ Philippine possessions. It has not yet j been decided whether we shall sub- ( eidize a company and have our leg J pulled for jears to come, or to go j down into our pocket for a lump sum j of about fifteen millions. ] The Pennsylvania Steel Company, which has immense iron works at ( Steelton, Pa., has notified its 6,000 workmen that their wages are to b? reduced 10 per cent, beginning with January 1st. This is not the sort of prosperity that tLcoo ritizens of Pennsylvania voted for a few weeks ago. , Strong efforts will be made at this session of Congress to commit our government to the work of building the i Nicaraguan canal, the cost of which ' will be about $200,000,000. We fa- j vor the schema. Time was when we did not, but if the United States is to embark on an era of expansion and ' world-wide exploitation we say let's ' go the whole thing. It has been shown that the people will staad almost unlimited taxation, and therefore there 1 should be no hesitation in building ] ????!

The Pennsylvania Railroad and the ] various roads which it controls, includ- , ing the Baltimore & Ohio, Norfolk & t Western and Chesapeake & Ohio, give ' notice that they will advance coal < freight rates ten cants a ton, beginning \ with the first of notf Anri 1 I . pers of soft coal have already advauced prices eighty cants a ton since last ( April, but thsy will probably take ad- , vantage of this opportunity to add \ thirty or forty cents more. There's something absolutely coldblooded in the way the railroads and the coal operators are gouging the people. Still, that's what the people voted for last month. The President's Message. President McKiuley sent Lis annual nessage to Congress on Monday. It s a very lengthy document, the greatr part of which is taken up with a liscussion of foreign affairs. The President shows that for the -ear ending June 30 last there was a urplus in in the Treasury of $79,>27,060.18; that during the same >eriod the war cost $134,774,767.73, >r $95,066,486.69 less than during the (receding similar period, and that the iavy cost $55,953,077.72, or $7,989, 26.53 less than during 1899. On the money question he says: It will be the duty, as I am sure it rill be the disposition, of Congress to rovide whatever futher legislation is ieeded to insure the continued parity inder all conditions between our two arms of metallic money, silver and ;old." He advocates a reduction in taxaion to the amount of $30,000,000 a ear. Immediate action is urged to romote American shipping. On the ubject of trusts, he makes the same ecommendations he made in his last lessage, and thinks those that are inirious should be restrained. Much ot the Philippine chapter is eminiscent, but declares that late reorts from the Commissioners "allow yet more encouraging advance toward good government in the interest f humanity and with the aim of uilding up an enduring self-eupportig and self-administering communif" After reviewing the circumstances f the constitutional convention in Cua, the President announces that when be convention concludes its labors he rill transmit to Congress the constituion for such action as it may deem dvisable. The necessity for a Pacific cable beween the United States and Hawaii, ;ith extension to Manila, is urged new. As to the army, the President recmrnends a minimum of 90,000 anil a maximum of 100,000 men. Included a this number authority should be iven to raise native troops in the 'hilippines up to 15,000, which the 'aft Commission believes will ba more ffective in detecting and suppressing nerrillas, assassins and ladrones than ur own soldiers. "In our great prosperity we must uard against the danger it invites of xtravagance in Government expendiures and appropriations, and the hosen representatives of the people rill, I doubt not, furnish an example a their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husands for the future. In this era of reat business activity and opportuniy caution is not untimely. It will ot abate, but strengthen confidence, t will not retard, but promote legitimate industrial and commercial expansion. Our growing power brings nth it temptations and perils requirng constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to invite contlicts, lor for oppression, but for the more elective maintainance of those prin.1 ~ /n!

The Martinsburg World says that he adventures of a young couple from Maryland ended in that city last Tueslay evening by both, one a pretty 'oung girl of nineteen years and the ither an insurance agent about tweny-six years of age, being landed belind the bars of the Berkeley county ail to answer the three serious charges >f adultery and two other kindred :rimea. The charge of bigamy will ilso be preferred against the man. The couple, William Strine and rennie M. fiouck, have been living at Mathews' boarding-house for the past ouc weeks under the name of Mr. ind Mrs. Johnson, the man making a iving for himself and his alleged wife >y soliciting insurance policies for the Provident Life Insurance Company. So particular notice was taken of the jouple until Tuesday afternoon, when Deputy-Sheriff Franklin K. Gersey, of pnnntr v.t u-lin wua split I I CUCl IV XX
