VJENI .EILdlEO-IlAP J ILo PHILADELPHIA, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, "I860. VOL. VI. No. 132. DOUBLE SHEET-THREE CENTS. NATIONAL BUDGET. Opinions of the Public Press on llie Message and Documents. Editorial Comments of Philadelphia and New Yoik Journals. Etc i Etc., Etc., Etc., Etc., Etc. The Message and Document. From the Worth American and U. 8. Gazette, Radi cal Republican. At present we shall consider these documents together, as forming par's of the one general pre sentation of the state of affairs and of the view and policy f the government. The first thing that occurs to the reader of these documents Is tba their whole tone, especially that of the President' met sage, Is very decidedly moderated from th b gti and Insolent bearing which so Incensed both Congrers and the nation. There is really nothing to complain of in the langnage or temper of any of these documents. It is apparent even to th most superficial observer that they are all ex tremely guarded, and that an effort has been mad to assume an air of courtesy and deference to th Seople's representatives, tor which the election ave prcbably afforded the hint. We may diOe from the sentiments advanced, bat no one can . deny that the opinions held by the writers of th , ftocurcenla are stated in very moderate terms . Looking at the sentiments themselves, we flnd them to be identical with those advanced in the documents of last year, and the policy advocated by the President does not differ a hair's breadth from that he has rendered so offensive; so that all the professions in favor of Impartial suffrage mast have been Intended to deceive those who under took to deal with him. Not a step is taken in the direction of any conciliation with Congress, nor is any plan of agreement even hinted at. Just as the plan of admitting the rebel States uncondition ally was submitted last year, it is repeated in the . present message. The statement made by this doenment Is so smooth, plausible and Insinuating, that many per sons will probably overloolrtbe misrepresentations it contains. The President, lor example, says that the enforcement of the laws is no longer obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial pro ceedings, which certainly Is not the fact. All over the south bands ot regulators oppress the Union men and the freedmen, burn their houses, flog and even kill them, and no judicial proceedings can reach the outlaws. No attempt has been made to enforce the Civil Rights act, and the combinations at tbe sontb have rendered it a dead letter. It is carious that the President wholly Ignores that statute in his messnge. Tbe Freed men's Bureau receives the coM shoulder in about the same style. Tbe message sa, fc that "the animosities engendered by the war are l ipld ly yielding to tbe beneficent in- fluenceaof onr free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrest Meted social and commercial inter course." "We 1 llsh it were so, but It is not. The frightful outrn ft that darkened the early history of Kansas have l-en transcended in magnitude and Iniquity all ovf I tbe south. The reign of terror is everywhere south full" established, and there is really no protection there for northern men or loyalists or freedmen. .. . Tte President rehearses his reconstruction ef forts, for the purpose ot again meddling with a matter of which Congress alone has constitutional jurisdiction the admission of members; from the rebel States. The triumphant manner in which the people have sustained Congress is coolly dis regarded by this message. It is not necessary to traverse this portion of the document, and we notice it now only to call attention to the fact that all the attempts at a new basis of arrangement have failed, and that the President yields nothing whatever to publlo opinion as declared in tbe elections. The President does not even attempt to present a reasonable excuse for interfering with tbe rolls of members of Congress, and it is not likely that either House will pay any attention to what be says on the subject. It is plain that it was written for the public and not for Congress, and hence the moderate language used. The Sec retary of the Treasury goes out ot his way In his report to meddle with the same matter, and to give it as one of the measures indispensable to the proper regulations of our finances. He makes the attempt to induce people to believe that the policy of Congress on reconstruction impairs the value of our public securities. Of course this argument is intended only to create opinion among the people hostile to Congress '' The President's Message. From the Inquirer, Moderate' Republican. The AioasHge of the President of the Unit ed States to Congress Has this merit about it, t hat although tlio views of the Executive are de cided as to the policy which should be adopted in regard to Hiatus lutely iu rebellion, the t tio is moderate. In loo kin it over it we oauuot dis cover anything that is absolutely new. The President recites the story of the measures wliicli lie had adopted prior to the last session of Congress in relation to the ineaus of recon struction, and argues as he then argued, that those Hlutes should be admitted to Congress upon their presentation of "loyal men" as Senators and Representatives. " In denomi nating the persons who have been elected to ihose positions "loyal." the President assumes the whole question. Congress, durliiii tho war, determined the test of loyally, and prescribed the oath which should be taken by ail otiicers who were chosen to discharge duties under the Government. It is notorious that a verv large proportion of the individuals who have beon chosen in the Houtheru Htates, to represent them In Confess, caunottake that oath, unless they are willing to perjure themselves, and that they were elected iu defiance of the law upon the subjoiit. It is, therefore, a fact, that no Htate lately in rebellion lias commissioned "loyal" men, and if Congress, without further -guaranties, were willing to admit Representa tives from those (States, there would be very few who are competent. But throughout his Message the President begs the question, and proceeds with his arguments as if it were ad mitted that there Is no controversy upon the subject. i . ' There Is much force in the plea of the Presi dent that it will be Judicious to admit Represen tatives from the late insurgeut htatos as soon as it can be done without injury to the Govern ment. But the delect In the "Message Is, that lie does not refer to the obstacle which undoubt edly exist, and which must be entirely removed before Congress would be Justified In relaxing its position. The Constitutional Amendments pre scribe nothing more than is absolutely neces sary, unless we are so foolish as to allow the Southern (States to comeback in to Congress with no jdedges lor future good behavior. If nolhliig bad ever happened lo breuk oil" ihe connection of the (Southern States with the Government if they had not withdrawn violently and con temptuously irom Congress aud endeavored to overthrow the Government, every argument of the President would be unanswerable. But its , weakness is, that it does not recognize the fact that, past misdeeds need punlslimeut aud the necessity of material guaranties for future loy alty and obedience to the laws. Ucuce, when he argues that by the Constitution each Mtiuo ahull have at least one Hopreseututlve. and that no felate shull without its consent be deprived of equal suilrage In the KoiiuUj, he lull to notice that the Htales for which lie pleads f consent to be deprived of such rights, aud declared t hut lliey would have no Representatives either In ihe House or fcennte, and solemnly washed t heir bunds of all participation In the Government. The President argues that they have a rlu'lit to piny fust and loose, and that the Congress of tbe United Slates bus no alternative but to sub mit io their whims when they withdraw, en dure their treason while attempting to keep out, and to admit them with humble uladuess, when, having tailed In their object, they choose to come bock. This course Is not one which a high spirited nation will adopt, aud when it is asserted, us it is in effect by the President, that certaiu States have a right to trlile w ith aud outrage their obligations, and then to resume them at their pleasure, he makes a suggestion which Is coulrary to human nature. Consider ing Dial the Constitutional Amendments were proposed by (uugres, representing yie loyal J icj.Jt tj ihv UnUvd lutos, and that they Uave been supported by nmnsong majorities on tbe ropulnr vote, nnd upon Hie direct Issue whether he policy of the President should be ratified. It would have been decent at loast In the Pienl dent to pay some attention to that subject, and to point out, if he could, In what particulars those propositions were harsh, burdensome or wrong. But be argues ns if nothing had ever existed which militated against his own planH, and he asksCongiess to adopt argument which ran only be sanctioned by perfect forgetfulness of all that has passed. We do not imiiKine that the President will have the least Influence upon Congress. The tilLimntuin of the people it the adoption of the Constitutional Amendments by the Hon t hern States, If they will not do so, His not likely thnt anything more mild and conci liatory will bo proposed, and something much more severe will be advocated. The Message. ' From the Public Ledger, "independent Johnson Jh mo era t." The anxiety to see the annual message of tbe Pre sident ol the United states was gratified yesterday, by the prompt sending of that document to Con gress, and ft equally prompt publication by the newspapers in a popular form. It is a plain and ciear statement of tbe principal topics in our na tional affairs now pressing upon the attention ot ttio country. It is moderate and statesmanlike in- its tone, and, as vas said in these columns yesterday, iscatculated rather to soothe than to exoite appre hensions in the public mind. Its two principal mlo lects are the question of reconstruction aud our re lation with France and Mexico. Reconstruction is substantially committed to the Judgment and action oi Congress, the only point re maining to be acted upon nunieiy, the readmislon ct the Kepresontativea lrom the ten unrepresented Mates be onging exclusively to that body. The PreMdent recommends, as a matter ot sound policy . and commercial interest, as well as of justice, that the Itepieson tali ves lrom these States shall be ad. , mitted, as was done in the case of Tennessee at tio last session.. I'his recommendation is summoned by ' a verv lull argument, but beyond this the President does not go k .his Message. So tar as our complica tions with Fr Mce on the Moxican question are eon cerned, the su Licet star' almost identically as we stated it yesteraay. ' i Tbe French tr ops are to be removed from Mdxloo in accordance with an understanding with the French Government, but whether they are to be removed in separate detachments at intetva s of two or thioe months, or in one body, at a period some what later than the time fixed for tbe withdrawal ot the first detachment, is the matter now in con troversy. Tbe two Governments seem just now to be In conflict npon this point, b it there Is reason o believe that their opDOsing views will be adjusted without much tioubie. Ihe other tonics of tbe Message are. in the main, brief references to subjects more fully set forth in the reports ot the heads of Departments which we publish cither in lull or in a condensed shape in othoi places, in this morning's issue. l The Message. From the Daily News, Johnson Organ. , , . The President deems it "a tuhject lor profound re gret that Congress has thus far tailed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Kepresentativts from the other states, whose inhabitants, with those of fen. nessee, bad eugaued in the Rebellion." "Thclr ad mission," tlie President believes," would have accom plished much' towards the renewal and s'rengi hon ing of our relation as one people, and removed serious cause for discon ent on the part of the in habitants ol those States " 'It would have accorded," says tbe President, "with tbe great principle enunciated in the Declara tion ot American Independence, that no people ouvht to bear tbe burden ot taxation, and yet be denied tbe tight of representation," He refers to the fact ti at all the btates whose people were in' insurrection were included in the apportionment oi tbe direct tax of t venty millions of dollars annually laid upon tbe Uuitcd States by the act of August, 1861. "Ten jears hence, if ttie-e States reraf in as they are, the right of representation will e po stronger, tbe -'lit of exo u ion will be no weaker." The argument ol the President on this subject is unamwerablo, and, as comoared with the disunion twaddle of radical orators and jourualisU, it is refreshing. . Tbe Message Is, beyond question, an admirable doctimont ; and, as we ta) k It lor granted taat each of our rraders will perui I it at length, we forbear further comment at this lime. The President awaits now tho aolion of Cong ws, and with its mambers are the ls.-ues of peaco f id harmony throughout the countrj, or disoord am etrfe. . .. , ,, , . "Occasional" on the Messnpje. 'My Dear Mr. Secretary," the Hon. John W, Forney, is not to be caught dirtying his fingers by handling the President's Message editorially. Ihe Press ignores the document in its sanctum, and lays it on the shell to dry, In this letter dated at WcJj ington and signed 'Occasional , The first day of the second session of the Thirty, ninth Congress has just closed, and. all the indica tions are auspicious, the President's Message nas, product d little more in,nression than a s.eepy edi torial in the National iVefi enoer. It is the old' story ot treachery disguised in aomeot Mr. Seward's faded rhctorio, and touched off with the cheap logio ol an obsequious Attorney-iacncral. So far Iroji an, original Idea, it Is the dismal iteration of rejected heresies and threadbare falsehoods so wear? that it n as listened to wixtioutan aonaront emotion, and L at tbe end, and befoie its reading was finish-Mi, the galleries were aimuer cleared.

IVVUIVV nT UV1 tUO bignillcant event ol the day. Tbe passage ot the bill repealing that section of the act of Congress, July IT, 1SG2, authorizing the President to extend amnesty to the Rebels, by an overwhelming vote in tbe House, is only the begin, ning of outative aud retributive lugislat'on. bo, too, ot Judge Keiiey's proposition to dismantle and re model the wbole Internal revenue system, which, on a suspension of the rules was reierred to the proper committee, lhts measure removes the whola pa tronage, under that tremendous system, lrom the President and tbe Secretary of the Treasury, and gives it to the Supreme Court of the United States, Another great lemcdv is the bid ot Hon. Thomas Williams, of tho Pit sbTg or Alleghany (Ta ) Dis trict, soon to be reported, substantially prov diug iortl:e suspension of the functions of any officer while he is on trial for crimes and misdemeanors before tho United States teoate., Ihe passage ot such a s atutr closes the legal gap in the impetch nient argument, and crystallizes the full power In Congress. Ihe discussion ot Andrew Johnson's outrages upon solemn law and executive honor has established the necessity ol such legislation, and you tnsy lest assured that neither his own mtrigu-s nor toe threats of his parasites, ino'uding the recent traitors, will deter Congrers from discharging all tnoir duties, even if among tjem'ishis own iuo. peachmekt., The message. From the Age, Undival fitmocral. The idea that the States were ettr out'oi the Union is combated with entire, success by the Pre sident, He shows that nlr Lluoolu, in his procla mation of September 22, 1802. spoke of the constitu tional relations between the United stales and each ol the States as being "suspended or disturbed," not broken or destroyed, and declared that the ob J -ct ol tho war was to remove tb disturbing' causes, .and allow tbe States to resume their old practical reJations with the national Government. I The President etablsnes the fact that tho States 'were never out ot the Union, aud having done tbis, it follows that when armed resistance to law and constitutional authority cease i, the- praotical re a tions between the Slates and (be na'ional Uovern ment should be restored, aud representation should be accorded to South Carolina and Georgia uoon ihe same principle that it is given to Pennsylvania and Maine. The position of the President upon this quoation of reconstruction and representation will be eiiu. neatly satisfactory to the true frb nds of republicau hbertv in the natjon. It is in lull harmony with tho theory of our Government and the teaohings of the men who Iramed it, and also has the sanction el succession of acts and d-o arations jrorn the very liarty which is now agitating in favor ol consolida tion and despotism. The hue lormer v drawn by (tlie President between himself and ihe radical party upon this vital isue has been again marked oat with unmistakable distinctness, and the contest Is now. State right and ooneUtutlonal representation, on tbe one baud i ami on the other, Congressional usurpation and national consolidation. Tbe bttio upon fcoso imuvd Wll nvw be opened, in Co.. TUB NEW 

YORK PRESS. From the Timts. It will be seen that tbe President offer, nothing new. His statement oi the case is a reiteration of the statement heard many times within tbe lust nine months) his arguments have all been used before; and bis recommendation w chiefly noticeable a evi dence that be has learned nothing from the emo tions, ana forgotten nothing in connection with his struggle with Congress. In no reseet does the Piesident attempt to n eet, or even indirectly to re cognize, the recent manifestations ot pubho opinion throughout the Mates wbich elevated him to ofllee. On the contrary, be explicitly declares that hi ''convictions, heretofore expressed, bave;undcrgne no change," and that "tin ir correctness hat boon eonfiimeo by reflection and time,". Ibis exhibition of unieiir.g purpose on the part of the President may not occasion surprise to those who know the firmness of will which marks bis character. We cannot but consider it, however, a serious error of judgment, and a source of dim. culty wbich we would gladly have seen averted in the session now opened. It has suited the Demo cratic press to belittle tbe significance of the recent elections; but only something a little short ol Judi cial blindness can have led Mr. Johnson to rely upon the Democratic rendering of popular opinion, Me, of ail men, should be able to estimate correctly the import of the verdict pronounced at the poll. When they d c ded agafnvt him, therefore when they repudiated bis policy and ranged them selves on thn side of Congres it became bis duty, not indeed to abandon bis convictions, but to accept tbe will oi the people as the law of his Administra tion, and either to withdraw all opposition to the t'onerofsioual plan, or to propose some new basis of adjustment, liy nogieoting to pursue one or the oilier ol these courses he has lost the last oppor tunity of cilecting a reconciliation with tbe great majority ot tbe party that elected htm, and has fur nished a weapon to nis adversaries which tiiey will wield to his detriment. We deem it probaolo that the foreign portion of the Message will, as a whole, prove uupalataole to tbose whom it directly concerns. Neiiuer Frano nor Great Diitain will indulge in ecstaoles on the occasion, ivut that nothing very alarming is teared in Wall street mav be inferred from the remarkable steadiness of the market lor gold and national secu rities yesterday after the couteuta or the Message had bCcme known. From the Herald. . Tbe President's Message is before our rcadors. Tbey will find it, as an exhibit of the working of tbe several Executive Departments during tbe last year, an mtenmiug, imtiuctive, and atislac:ory Slate paper, while upon the great issue of Southern reconstruction, it reads like a cuapter from "ihe World belore the Deluge." Mr. Johnson devotes two tedious newspaper columns to a defense of bis last year's measures and general Ideas of Southern restoration, including some beautiful extracts from Washington's Farewell Address, and IromJoffer son and Jackson, in support of his theory ot state riyhts and the poweisot Congress, and tben ue drop the sul ject. It is an argument to tho court after the jury had rendered their verdict. Itmiy be compared to a history of Fiance, omitting the revolution which overthrow tho Bouruons, as a trivial matter, not worth mentioning ,n pleading i tholr claims to the throne. . It is, indeed, remarkable that after deliberately submitting bis Soumorn policy against tho p an of Congress to the people in the fate eleo ions, the Pre sident should not have a word to say of the will of : the people, asirade manifest In these elections. He talks of 'tbe ancient laud marks," as if none of them bad been swept away . bv tho late Southern itciuge of fire and blood, a if the war had changed nothing, and as if the reoont eleotions had decided notning. In a word, Mr. Johnson forgets that we have passed throngb the fiery ordeal of a nvguty revolution, and that tbe pre-existing order of things i gone and can return no more- that a great woric of reconstruction is before us, and that we cannot ' escape it. indeed, tbe gist ol the Message may be suramel up in the simple remark that it turns over to Cougress tbe settlement of our domestic and our foreign troubles, and we can only hope that the two Houses will use fo the demands of tho crisis, and prove equal to tho task asrigctd them. From the World. , ' It is probable that the Republican members of Conguss knew Ot the Piesideut's inflexibility when they he.d their intubated caucus, on Satur day evening. But this is a point ot no conse quence. "What is certain, and what tho oountry is most concerned (o know, is, that the Presidont r mains immovable, and Congress belligerent. Tho elections have not awed him in o any dogr:e of subml siveues", and lie restates his position with a masculine, convincing clearness, which must pro duce a favorable impression upon all candid men. . He does not deigu to pay the Constitutional ' Amendment even the coin compliment of a pass ing adusion; nor is there any reason why he should. If, when the Legislatures have all acted upon the amendment, the rejections are more than one-fourth ol tbe whole number, the amendment will be ju-t . as dead as if it had laded to get a two-thirds vote in Congress. That this is to be the result no intelli gent man doubts; and why should the Pie-idont have occupied space with a measure wh'ch long S'nce passeit beyond tbe control of Congress, and is far on its way towards the limbo of lost or abortive tbings? Both the tone and the arguments of the Message, 011 this leading topic, are excellent. In aignity, aecorum, and ohaste simplicity of language, few messages ever sent to Congress have been more cre iitulile. It is entirely tree lrom the asperity some times too Irei ly exhibited to Mr. Johnson's popular speeches. In his reasoning thee is uothiug wire diawn; tliero are no letches of ingenuity; but a straiglulorward presentation oi the so id grounds of his policy. It the exclusion oi part of tne Slates lrom Congress is jutfcttiable now, it wi.l be equally Justitiuble ten, twenty, liltv years heuoe, Ihe loirical consequence is a perpetual disso'ution of the Union. Tne reasons lor tho adm.ssion of the States are as strong now as they will over be. 1 be mete lapse oi time can add nothing to the force ot a constitu' tonal obligation. Th re is no argu ment tor excluding them now which i not equally good for excluding them forever. But if the result ot tbe war i tbe final dismemberment of the Union, it is something very diflerent fiom what the Kcpub lttau. promised while the war was in progress. From the Iribune. It is not so much what the President says as what he declines to say. The first impression ot the Mes sage is that his luxcelloucy is ohas'oned. . He make no allusions to Congress hanging on the verge ot the Uovernmeut. I'his is something from an Execu- i five wuo has been in the most unreasonable humor lor to many mouths. Mr. Pierce could not have ) v.rilfl?u a weaker manage, Congress wou'd as. ; readily bave heard an esay upon the cause of . thunder as this tame and harmless disquisition . ! I here is much that the President regrets. Ibere : aie some good words from Waciington and Jeifer I ton, likewise Jackson. Wo marvel that his Excel lency neglected the other fathers of tholr country. For any living tact, for any suggestion, for any lie pful thought, we might as well turn to the last novel of Mr. Irollope as to this Message. Ephraiui seems irrevocably Joined to bis Idols. There is much that Mr. Johnson might have done lie baa missed many golden opportunities but none so glorious a this. Congress came from the people magnanimous ana kind. There was no disposition to renierrber anything that had beon done not evon lie shameless antagoui-m to the people in tho reoeut election". All good men trusted that one word might be said which would shoa a disposition on i lie part of the President to resch a solution ot the many difficulties surrounding tho oountry. All that his Excel. enov has done was no longer remembered vthen we saw the peace he might bring to a harassed nation , loving kindness and lest. We believe that there was no feeling of resent nient to the Piesident, not even in the hearts of kIio most radlcai members ot Congress, that would i.ot have given away before the slightest tendonoy 'ot tbe President to harmonise the country. In but Message he shows no such tendency, tie clings 10 his . dogmas with as much . tenacity . as wben he hoped to carry the country in the late ; elections. There is not one word for the neoro not ! iuo word foi tlie loyal in the South not one sen tence which might not as well have been written a , bundled years ago as to-day, for all the comlort aud ' ti nth it brings. i we have no heart to awou upon this dreary, liru less document. There is nothing that any loval man cue read with comfort or hope - Andrew Johnson is as much an enemy as when he monaced the nation lrom bis White House stops ten mouths ao. He does not mean to aid v in the wore of reconstruc tion. The duty devolving up m Congress becomes more solemn and responsible, and we look to Con gress witn infinite votmdug. Let there be, kindness aud patience, charity towards a 1, malice towards none, firmness aud devotion; but, above alt, a sin-rlo-beartcd determination, come well or ill, despite Piesldenta or Cabinet, to labor without ceaslug, until over this land ihoe shall be peace anl re-t, hbcity and protection, mjd ml ltUt for all.
