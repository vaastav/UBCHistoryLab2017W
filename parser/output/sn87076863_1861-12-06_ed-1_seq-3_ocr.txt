Yon not ba snrpiised to learn that in the pe culiar 1 x'gm.cUs of the timis our iiitricours-c with foreign nations has been ntteucieu nhh profound folieitudo, rhiifly tuiuing upou our owu domestic affairs. - TUB 

REBELLION tfc FOREIQN INTKKKKRENCK. A dialoyal portion of the American people liave duiing the whola year, been engaged iu an attempt to divide and destroy the fjnioti, A nillion which euduret factions domestic divl-ituu is espied to disrespect abroad, mid one party, or both, i$ mire, ronner or Inter, to invoke fo oij-ti intervention N'.-.tii'us thus tempted to inteifeie, ore not always able to resit the counsels of steiuiug i-xucdieucy ami ungenerous ambition, although measures adop ted under such influences, seldom f'lil to be tin fortunate and injmious tt those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of tl e United States who haVe. offered the ruin of our country iu reward for the aid and comfo;t which they have invoked auioaJ, have received les patronage aud encour agement thn they prob'ibly expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign tuitions in this c f e. disregard ing all moral, social, nud treaty obligations, would act solely aud selfishly for tbe most speedy resto ration of couimctce, including espiciully the nc-qul.-ition of cotton, these nut ions have appear a yet uot to have seen their way to their object mote di tectly or clearly through the destruction than tbe p-eservatiou of the Union. If we could d ro to believe that foreign nations are actuated by uo higher piineiple than this, I am quite sure a second argument Could bo made to show that they could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion thn by giving eneouragc ment to tho principal lever relied ou by it. The exuiliug of foreign nation! to hottilities against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment of com inerce. These nations, howevur, not improbably taw from tbe fi st that it was the Uuion that made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce.- They cau scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion D educed the present difficulty, nud medicines, lie chaws reasonable for pro j th 't one strong nation promises mo-e durable - . .V . nfnpp. and h vnv.rr cxtensiv valuable, and re haii e acriptions.

OUR 

DEFENCES. " I also, in the same connection, ask the attention of Congress to our great, lukes and rivers. It is believed that some fort'fjcations and depots for arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, at well selected points upon these would be of great importance to the national de fence and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, exnresscd in his report on the same general sohject. I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of East Tennes1 see and Western North Corolioa should be con It is gratifying to know that the expenses nmde necessary by the rebellion are uot be yond t lie resources of the toyal people, and to brlievu that the same patriotism which has thus far Sustained the Government will con tinue to sustain it until peace and union shall again bless ihe land. ' THE ARltr. T respect full v lefer t the report of the Secretary of War tor information respecting the numerical stiength- of the iirmv, and for eeouiineudutious having in vivr aa increase of its efficiency, and the well being of the va rious branches of the service entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that 'the patriotism of the" people is 'equal to : the otension, and that 1Uo number of troops ten dered greatly exceeds tho force which Con gress nnthoried me to call into the field. I n-efer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condi tion of the entire army. The recorrmendution of the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a "uhject of vital importance to the future safety of the country, and is conirnen-- ded to Ihe serious attention ot Congress. A 1 uge nddi'ion to the Reeular Army, in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his , re commendation for increasing the corps of ca dets' to the greatest capacity of the Military Academy. :I?v mere onrrssion, I presume, Congress has failed to provide Chaplains for hospitals oc cupied ior volunteers. Tins sntijec was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw no' the form of a letter, one copv of which propei 1 v addressed to each of the per sons, and at the dates respectively named and stated in the schedule, containing aiso the toim of the letter ' A. and herewith submit ted:; These, gentlemen, I understand, enter ed upon the duUes assigned, at the times ( respectively stated in tfie schedule, anu nave labored faithfully therein ever since. 1 there fore recommend that they be compensated nt the same rate as Chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general previsions lie i made for chaplains to serve at hospitals nS well as with regiments. ; ; THE KAVr. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operation of that branch of the service, and the activity and energy which have characterized its administration and the results of mensures to increase its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions by construction and purchase- that it may almost be said a navy has beeu crea ted and brought into service since our diffi culties commenced. Besides blockading our extensive Const, s uadrons larger' than ever before assembled und?r our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown. I would invite special attention to the re commendation of the Secretnry of the Navy for a more perfect organization of the navy, by introducing additional grades into the service. The present organization is defect ive and unsatisfactory, and the suggestion of the Department will, it is believed, if adop ted, obviate the difficulties alluded to, pro mote harmony aud increase the efficiency of the navy. THE 

JUDICIARY. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court. Two by the decease of A Destructive Fire. : , ' On Tuesday morning about 4 o'clock, our citizeDS were aroused from their quiet k'tnberi by the alaini of fire sounding in our streets. On coining fauh from - our dwellings the whole sky was illumin ed with the .reflection of the burning buil dings, and in searing the locUs of the fire the fitful blaze shot up far hbove the sur rounding buildings. It was soon discov ered that the cause of tbe grand illumia at ion was the burning of Wm. Ayet's Steam Sash faciory, together with the large wagon manufactory of Bearinger Hale A Co. The buildings were coti traded of Wood, two stories high, and containing a large stock of material, all of , which was combustible, and Upon which the flames were soon feeding. In the' course of two hours the entire pile of . buildings were a charred mass of ruins, together with the dwelling of Mr. Bearin ger which adjoined the wagon shop. Messrs BearSnger.Halo & Go's loss will te heavy, many estimating it as high as 86, j 000. They had on hand some four or five wagons, all completed and ready for sale, while in process of construction were some thirty or forty more, which with a valuable assortment of seasoned material, Was all consumed. Wm. Ayei's Sash fac tory, in which the fire was first discover ed. with all their valuable machinery was totally ruined causing a loss to this enter prizing gentleman of $3,000 to ?4,000. Upon Mr. Bearinger the loss fulls heavi est, as he had (so we learn) the savings '. of years of toil invested in his business anil buildings. Thus in a few hours, all lias been taken from him. We sympathise most deeply with him in his loss, as we nected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the me union oy ranrcaa. i ineretore recommend as a military measure, that Cougress provide for the construction of such a road as speedily as possible. Kentucky will doubtless cooperate and through her Legislature make trie mot judicious selection of the line. The Northern teimiuons to connect with some existing rail road, and whether the rout shall be from JLeiington or Ifich olasvilleto (Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to tbe Tennessee line, in the dir ection of Kuozvillo, or some still different line, ean easily be deter mined Kentucky and the General Governmeut eooperating, . the work can be accomplished in a very short time, aud when done, it will not ouly le of vast preseut usefullness, but also an evailable permanent inprovemeut, w orth, its cost iu all the future. " FOREIGN TREATIES. " Some treaties designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political im portance, htve been negotiated, and will be sub- nutted to tne henate lor consideration. Although we have failed to iudece some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration for the rigor of maritime war, we have far removed all the obstacles from the way of their humane re form, except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your attention to thecorresponnence between Her Bntanic Majesty s Minister,Bccredited to this Government, and the Secretary of State, relative to the detention of the British ship Pertsbire, in Juuelatt, by the United Steles steamer Massachusetts, for supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasionod by an obvious misrepresentation of the facts, and as justice rcqruies that we should commit no belligerent act, not founded iu strict rigtfct, as sanctioned by public law, 1 recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reas onable demaud of the owners of the vessel for her detention-. " THE CHISA CLAIMS. I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to Congress in December last, as to the disposition of thcsmplus that will probably remain after satisfying the claims of cit izens of Ihe United States against China, pursu ant to the awards of the Commissioners, under the act of the drd of March, I5ih If, however, it should not be deemed advisable lo carry that resignation . of Justice Campbell. I h(ve so far foreborne making nominations to fill these vacancies, for reasons which I will now state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided in the States now overrun by revolt, so that, if suc cessors were appointed in the same locali ties they could not serve upon their circuits, and many of the most competent raen there propably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the Su preme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the ap pointments North, thereby disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return of peace, although, I may remark that to transfer to the North one which has hereto fore been in the South, would not, with refer ence to territory and population be unjust.' During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts therein more than a nomi nal attendance, rising in population from 1,470,000 in 1S2I, to y,l",l,405 in 1E60. Be sides this the coHtiti'7 has generally outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended the system requires that all tbe States si all be accommodated with Circuit Courts, attended by Supreme Judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California and Ore gon, have never had any such courts; nor can this be well remedied without a change of the system, because the adding of Justices to the Supreme Court, enough lor tho accom moda ion of all paris of the country with Circuit Courts, would create a courtaltogether too dangerous for a jtidtetarv body ot any sort, and the evil of it. be increased as new States come into the Union. Circuit Courts ari useful or they are not useful. If useful no State should be denied them,. If not use ful no Slate should have them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished as to all, Three modifications occur to ineliere, which I think would be an improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme C urt be a convenient number in every event. Then first let the whole country be divided into 

NORTHERN CLAIMS tN tttitiKL STATES. One o! the, unfavorable consequences of the prest-nt insurrection is the entire suppression in many plasesof allordinaiy mcitns of administering civil justice by the officers, and in the forma ol existing low. This is the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent States, and as our ar mies advance upon and take possession ol parts "of those Slates, the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts or officers to whom the citiz-ns ol other Statt a maj apply for the enforce ment of their liwful claims against ciii tsetis of the insurgent S'ales, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims, , Some have estimated it as high as 200.000, 000 d-dlars, due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens, who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge o! tit ti r patri otic-duty to support the Uovrrnmt-nt. Un der these circumstances I have been ur gently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to admi ister summary jus tice in such cases. 1 havethus far declined (o do it. not because I had ,'-.riy doubt that thp end proposed, tne collection of debt was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exer cise of power. But the powers oi Con gress, I euppose, are eqtnl to the anom alous occasion: and therefore, I refer the whole matter lo Congress, wilh the hope that a plan may be devised for the ad ministration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and teiritoiies as may be under a eonlrol of this Govern ment, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the powi r ol our arms. This, however, is not to bi u permanent institution, but a temporary fubstitute, and to cease as scon as lliu or dinary courts can be re established in peace. CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. 1 1 is important that some more conve nient means should be provided if possi ble for the adjustment of claims against the Government, especial'y in vi"w of the increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of the Govern ment to render prompt justice against it self in favor of citizens as it is to adminis ter the same between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of all the claims in their nature belong to the Judicial department besides it is appar ent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some limt to come with great national questions. It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of Con gress; but while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of in vestigation, it in a great degree fails to effect '.he object of i's creaiion for want oi power to make its judgments final, i ully aware of the delicacy, not to say danger, of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of ma king judgments final may not be proper ly given to the Court, reserving the right ot appeal on questions of law to the Su preme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be nec essary. THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. reeommendtt'en into efteel, I would snggest that i circuits of convenient size, Uie Supreme authority be given for investing the principal, Judges to serve in a number of them corres oVer tbe surplus referred to, in good securities ponoing with their own num'ier, and inde- witn a view to tne satistactioa ot sunn, other just I pendent l.lvcuit Judges be pro"iueu lor all claims of ow citizens against China as are not uu likely to arise hereafter, in the course of our ex tensive trade with that Empire. ' By tbe act of the 5t,h of March Inst, Cougress authorized the President to instrm t the command ers of suitable vessels to defend themselves agsinst, and to capture pirates. This authority has been experienced in a single instance ouly. For the move effectual protection of our exten sive and valuable commerce in the Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me, that it would also be advh-nble to authorize ti e command eis of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates make of United States vessels and their carg- es, an.l the Consular Courts established by law iu East tern Countries to adjudicate the cases iu the events that this should uot be objected to by the local authorities. THE 

INDEPENDENCE OF HAYTI A LIBERfA do Wllb Messrs. Hale, Rubendall and j H any good reason exists why we should per , 1 severe longer in w ithholding our recoguitiou of Ayrs. ! the independence and sovereignty of Hayti aud Uaa not tne night been calm, and the ljll)em 1 ",n "au:e to aisceru it. uuuug nuwever, iu mauguiaie a novel puney m legara to thiin without the approbation of Congress, 1 submit for your consideration the expediency of au appropriation for maintaining a Charge d'Aff iiies near each ol these States. : It uois not admit of doubt that impo tant commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties' with tttem. roofs of the adjacent dwellings covered with a few inches of snow, it would be our melancholy task to chronicle the de struction of most of our village, for water buckets, and roofs covered with blankets saturated wilh water, no matter how val uable they may be in their place, are not sufficient protection against the ravages of su;h a fire as that of Tuesday morning with a high wind and dry roofs. We do hope that, our citizens will now see the 'the necessity of acting promptly in the organisation of a Fire Department. We nerd it need it badly and we hope that some of our influential and enterprizing - citizens will go forward la so good a cause tts py (Ii is fire two chief sources of wealth to our village has been cut off, a number of hands thrown out of employment, and " whether those who are the greatest suf t ereie by this calamity are able lo rebuild . restart ibeir premises, and go speedily to ; work again, is more than we eao tell. ' W fain hope that they are. The whole is a total loss there being no insurance on any of tbe property destroyed. THE TREA61TRV. -The operations of the Treasury duriuc tbe oe- riol which has elapsed since your adjou nment, have been conducted with "signal success. The pa triotism of the people has placed nt the disposal of tbe Governmeut the laree means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the National Loan has been taken by citizens of the iudnstrial classes, whose cnfi lenc in their enuntiy's faith and zeal for their co entry's delivernce f:om its present peril, have induced them to contribute to the support of the Government, the whole of thi ir limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to. economy in disbursement and ener gy in action. The revenue from all . sources, including loans for ihe financial year ending on the 30th of June 1801, was $80,830,900 27, and the same period, including payments on r.o cnunts of Ihe public debt, were 84,67834 31 ; leaving a balance in the Treasury ou the 1st of July of $2,257,065 80 for the ' 1st quarter If the financial year ending the 30th of Sept. HOI The receipts from ill sources, including balanco from July 1st, were $102,o3'-,50O 27, and the expenses, $'.8,'J:J9,733 00 ; leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 183 1, of $1, 202,77G IS. Estimates for the remaining tin ee quarter's of thejearand fijr the financial y eat of 1861, together with his views on tho ways and means for mcet'ag the demands ccateui pliled by them, will be submitted to Congress r ' t ??.-'. "' t'-fr 7 .: : j the rest ; or, secondly, the Supreme Judges be relieved from circuit duties, and Circuit Judges provided .for a the circuits; thirdly dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, leav ing the judicial functions wholly to the Dis trict Courts, and au independent Supreme Court. THE IT. S. 

STATUTES. I respectfully recommend to the con sideration of Congiess, the present con dition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy lor the many inconveniences and evils which embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the organization of the Govern ment. Congress lias enacted some 5,000 acts and joint resolutions,, which fill moie than (),C0 0 closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been dr''wn iu baste and without sufficient camion, so that their proviions are often obscure in them selves or in conflict with eacl. othei, or at least so doubtful as lo render it very dif ficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law is. It seems lo me very important that the! statute law should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a com piss s may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the-legislature and the perspifcuity of its language. These well done would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duy it is to assist in the adminis tration of tjhe laws, an would be a lasting benefit to the people by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and duties. 1 am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in, force and of a permanent, gener al nature, might be revised and re-writ ten so as to bo embraced iu one volume, or at least two volumes of ordiuary and convenient size; and I respectfully rec ommend to Congress to consider the sub ject, and if my suggestion be approved, to devise such a plan as to their wisdom shall stem most proper fur the attainment cf 'it t-Z'i ;;rocvt'ed, . I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General, the following being a summary statement, of the Condition ol the Department. ihe revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending SOlli June, 18.51, including the annual perma nent-appropriation of 6700.000 for the transportation of free mail matter was S9, 049, 296 40, beinir about two per. cent less than the revenue of 1860. the ex penditurs were 13, GOG, 709 1 1. "show ing a decrease of more than 8 per cent, as compared with those tf the previous year, and leaving an excess of expendi tures over the revenue for the last fiscal year of over 567,462.71. The gross revenue for the year ending June 30th, I C3, is estimated at an increase of four per cent, on that of 1861, making 8. 683,000; to which should be added the earning ot the department lor carrying free ma ter, viz: 700,000, making S9,- 382,000. Tbe total expenditures for 1663 are estimated at 8 1 2,523, 0;.)0, leav ing an estimated deficieucy of 3,334,000 to be supplied from the Treasuiy, in ad dition to the permanent appropriation. THE 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The present insurrection sbows, Ithink. that ihe extension of this district across the Potomac river at the time of estab lishing the capital, here whs eminently wise, and cenMqueutly. that the relin quishment of that portion of it which lies in the fatate of Virginia, was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your cosidera lion tbe expediency of regaining that part of the district and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through ne go'iations wilh the State of Virginia. Arkansas. Tho agentR of the United States! appointed since tb 4th of - Match, for ibis supertiitendaney, have been uiiHple to reach thoir posts, while the' mosV -of th ose who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assumed to exercise the powers of agents by .virtus ol commissions from tho insurrectionists." it has ben stated in tho public press that a portion of tt.tfselndiaiis have been ' organized as a military force and are attached to the army of. the insurgents- although the Government - has not- official ' information upon tho subject.'7 Ijetters have been Writ ten to the Coinmisioner of Indian atfaira by several prominent ehiefs.giving assuranice of their loyalty to the United States, nud ex pressing the wish for the presence of the Federal troops' to protect the n. It is be lieved that on the re possession of t he count ry by tho Federal force, the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to tho Govru tnent. 

AGRICCI.TURE. Agriculture, confessedly tha largest inter est of the nation, has not ;i department or a bureau, but n clerkship only assigned to it in the Government. While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its uatiirc as not to have demanded and extort ed more from tho Government, I respectful ly ask Congress to consider whether some thing more cannot be giving voluntarily with general advantage. . Annual reports exhi biting the manufactures would present a luitd of information of great practical value to the country. While I makfl no sugges tions as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might probably bo organized. THE 

SLAVE TRACK. The execution of the laws for tho sup pression of the Afric tn slave trade has boen confined to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that the ef torts which have been made for thesnppres sion of this inhuman traffic have recently been attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted, out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned ; two mas ters engaged in the trade, and one person equipping the vessel as a slaver has been con victed aud subjected to tha penaltv.of fine and imprisonment, and ono captain taking has been convicted of tho highest grade of offence under our laws, tho punishment ot which is death. THE TEP.ruTOME9. The Tenitories of Colorado, Dakota!) and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inagnrated therein under auspices especially gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when tht Federal officers arrived there. The abund ant natural resources of these Tenitories, with the security and protection afforded by orgnvztlion Governmeut, will doubtless in vite t them a largo imigiuiion ".vhorj peace shall restore the business of the country to to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions, of the Legislature of . Colorado, which evinced tha patriotic spirit of tho peo pie of the territory. So far the atttltority oi the United States has been upheld in al! the territories, as it is hoped it will be in tbe futllro. I commend tlieir interest and de fence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress flict for this pui poac shall uot degenerate' into a violent and retnon less revolutionary struggle. 1 havu iherefoie, in evry, ras-e thought it ' proper to kecj the integrity of tbtf-Union prominent as the primary oljct of the conioit On our part,' leaving all ques tions which are not of vital military im portanco to the more deliberate action of the legislature. " ' -; ; ;--, V In the exercise of my best discretion, 1 have adhered to the blockade of the ports helj by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation, the laws of 'congress enacted at the late session, for closing those porta, also obeying the dictates of prudence ai well as the obligations ot law. . . ,t i, ' ' Instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of congress lo confiscate pro port v used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon tli satne subject should be pro posed, its propriety will be duly considered The Union must be preserved, and hence all dispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine what radical and extreme measures which may reach-the loyal as well as 'the disloyal, are indispensable. The Inaugural address at the beginning of tha administration, and the Message to congress at the late Rpecial ses sion, were both mainly devoted to the do rnestic controversy, out of which 'the. insur rection aud consequent war . ha o sprung Nothing now occurs to ac'd or substract to or from the principles on general put poses stated and expressed in those documents.! a- UEVinw. . ' The last, ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the assault up on Fort Smnpter, and a general review5 of what has occurred s:nce. may not be un profitable. What was painfully uncertain than, is much belter defined ami more dis tincf. now, and the progress of events is plainly in tbe right direction. The insur gents confideii iy claimed a Jstrong support times hinted nt as a possible refuge from tbePrrorof the people. In mr present posiii n I wou'd carcely be justified wer 1 to omit raising a wrning Voice against this approach of returning dfpoifain. CAflTAL ASD 

LABOR. : 1 T: It is net needed, nor titling here, that "general argument ah ould be made in favof of popular insiituliot, bat there U one-point, with its connections, oof to hackneyed as most others, to ' which I ask a btlef attention.' itjs the etforfc to place capital on an equal footing witTi, if not, above, labor, in the structure of gor- ernroent. It is assumed that labor is a vailable nly in connection with erapital that nobody labor unless somebody Ise, owning capital, somehow by the use of it, induces them lo labor.: Ti is assumed it is'mxi considered, whether it is bvst ihat capi.al shall hire .laborers, and lh9 in duce them to work I y their own consent, ur levy them and drive them to it without their consenl. Having oroceeded ihut fr it is naturally concluded that all lij borers are either hrrccf laborers or what we call slaves, ami furthi r. it is assumed that whoever is once laborer is fixed in that condition for life. A large majority belong o naithcr class noith er work for others, nor have others working for them.

I recommend to the favorable ' consider ation of Congress the interests of tho District of Columbia. The insurectiou has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to the inhabitants, and as they have no ropresenla tive in Congress,that body should not "over look their ittst claims upon the Government. THE INTERIOR. The report of the Secretary of the Iuteri or,with the accompanying doeutnents,exhib it the condition of the several branches of tho public business pertaining to that De partraent, Tho depressing influences of the insurrection have been especially felt in the operations of the Patent aud General Land Office. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have ex ceeded tbe expenses of our land system only about two thousand dollars, ihe Saks have been entirely suspended iu tho South ern States, while, the interruptions to the business of the country, and the diversions of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new. States aud .Territories 'of the North west.''" ' '" The receipts of the Patent Offices havo declined in nine months, about 1000,000 dollars," rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to . make it self sustaining,- The demand upon tho Office will be largely increased by the insurrection-. Numerous applications for pensions based upon the casualties of t he existing war. have already been made. There is reason to de lieve that many who are now upon tho Pen sion Roll nud in. receipt of the bounty of the Government are in the ranks of tho insur gent army or giving them aid and comfort. Tho Secretary of the Interior has directed the suspension of the payment of the peus oii of such persons, upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congiess au thorize that officer to cause the names of such pcrsonsto bo stricken from the pension rolls. ; - , , ' INDIAN AFFAIH3.

At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing tbe President to take measures for fecilitating a proper representa tion, of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations, to be holden at London in tho year 1862. I regret to have beeu tm.lble to give personal attention to this snj jeer, a subject at once so interesting iu itself, and so extensively and intricately connected . with the material prosperity of tho world Through tho .Secretaries of theStatc and In terior a plan or system has beeti devised and partly matured which will be laid before you. . THE CONTRAteAtsD 'Qt'KSTlOS. . Under and by virtue of the act of Congress, entitled an act to confiscate property u.sed for insurrectional y purposes, approved Aug. Olh, 1861, legal claims of Certain per; oris to the labor and servu-e ot certain other per ' sous have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already depend ant on the United States, and must be pro vided for in some way besides, , this, li is not impossible- that some of the States "will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by the operations which persons of tiie same class will pe thrown upon them for disposal. In such case 1 recommend that Congress provide for ac cx-ptinof such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu pro tunto of direct taxes the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This however was soon settled definitely and on the right side. South of the line noble little Dela ware led oft' right from the first. .Maryland was made to seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned and rail roads torn up within her limits, and we were many days at one time with out the ability to bring a inglo regiment over the soil to the cai ital. Now her bridges and railroads are re paired and opened to the uovernment. Sbe already gives seven regiments to the cruise of the Union and ubtie to the enemy, and her ' people at ,t regular election have sustained the Union by n large', mujority, and a larger agr gate vote than' they ever before gave to any candidate or any ques tion. Kentucky too. for some time in doubt, is now decidedly,, and 1 think un ehangeabiy ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is again com j aratively quiet, and I believe cannot ngiin be overrun by the inurg "tits. These three States, Man-Ian'.'., Kentucky and Missouri neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than . 40,000 in the field for the Union, while of their citisens not more than a third are among tho insurgents, and they of doubtful where abouts aud existence. 1 . After a somewhat bloody: struggle of three months, winter' closes on the union people ot Western . Yfrginiii, leaving them masters ot their own country. Atv r.insur gent force of about 1,500, for months dom inating the narrow, peninsular region con sisting of the counties of Accomac and Northampton-, and known as the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some con tiguous parts of 'Maryland, have laid down i heir arms and the people- there liave re newed their allegiance to the accepted and pi tection of the old flag. This leave no armed force North of tho Potomac or East of the 'Chesapeake; ' . Also, wp have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the Southern Coast of Hatteras, Port Koyal, Tybee Island, near Savannah, and Ship Island, and we likewise have some general Kcccsui'its of popular movements in behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Tennessee. These things demonstrate that the cause of the Liiion is advancing steadily Southward.
