Andrews, president of the Retail Merchants' As sociation, today regards the snecea tion of the economy board of the Council of National Defense that one regular delivery a day be established as a maximum for retail stores throughout the United States. "Conditions in Washington would not permit of such a radical step right now," declared Andrews In an Interview today. "Over 100.000 people have been added to the population of the Capital,-In the past few months. ana more are coming- every aay. .Most of them arrive here with only their hand luggage. They have to set up housekeeping, and they have to have all sorts of furniture and household necessities at once. Moreover the Christmas shopping is now under uay It would be impracticable at this time to reduce deliveries to only one a day. "But I do think that deliveries should be reduced to two a day. one in the morning and one In the afternoon, as I shall suggest to the merchants of Washington at the meeting of the Retail Merchants' Association Mon day. - "Great congestion exists in the freight yards of Washington owing to the inability of the transfer com panies to handle incoming shipments. Washington merchants make four de liveries a day. Dy eliminating two of them they can devote part of their equipment to hauling their own freight. This will do away with the long lines of cars standing in the yards waiting to be unloaded, and will release cars -quickly for use. Such a course might possibly aid in doing away with th present embar goes."

PROPAGANDA NOW OPPOSES FOE LIES The l mcil States la Usiiifr a new and subtle weapon In warring: against Germany a propaganda of truth. Nightly there in a battle' in the air a sirugRle of huge wireless ap paratus, centering; at Sayville, I I.; Nauen, Germany, and Lyons, France while at the same-time cables bgiz with messages Intended for foreign consumption. Formerly it nas the Xauen station that spread mislead. in g propaganda as to Teuton purposes. Now the Sayville station, under American, con? tro! Is j hoot Lap forth truthful, mes sages to offset thin Insidious matter sending: to France for relay to Russia and elppwhcre. U. S. Combats Foe lairs. Finding tiiat Germany Vas oulma neuverlng all the allies and the United States in malicious propa ganda, this Government determined on a definite campaign or education, and to date has labored chiefly in con verting Russia, Roumania, Austria. and Switzerland to Americas side. Perhaps the most startling attempt of any- though not so labeled -was the President's message to Congress Tuesday. In this the President sought to wean Austria from the German side, as officials view It to day. while at the same time h ap pealed to !rman liberals to over turn Hohen-eollernifm. The Government has enlisted the aid of banished Germans in Switzer landmen who fai'or a republic to help spread this doctrine into Ger many, while, as In the past, allied flyers will drop copies in German over the Teuton trenches Russian UllTlrultlri. With the Russian situation the Ad ministration has difficulty In com munication, inasmuch as the Rolshe- vikl control the main arteries out of. Moscow and Pctrograd. However, constant news matter -showing the American lewpolnt is being sent to Russia via France, and Is being dis tributed as best It may. The Ameri can military attaches, apparently act ing under Embassador Francis in dividual instructions, have under taken independent propaganda there, but apparently with boomerang re sults. Switzerland, a hotbed of German propaganda, was being flooded with evil tales about American intentions, but this has been offset by an official communication to Switzerland, show ing there will be, no overrunning of Swiss neutrality. Meantime Rou mania, apparently tending toward an armistice with Germany, Is being heartened by promises of American aid and actual contributions in the way of loans.
