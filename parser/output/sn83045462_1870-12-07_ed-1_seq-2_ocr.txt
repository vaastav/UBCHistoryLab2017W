No city in the cour.try is put to such disadvantage by it* ex terior r<>ad.? a* Washington. In no direction hare we access to the country except over one ot these '? turnpike" road-. They afford no accommodation to the public,and yet by their r\orbit*Tit tolls they serve to m ike everything consumed in the city so much dearer, aud to that extent increase the costof living here, and hinder tl-e prosperity of the citr. ft is safe to fay that there is'not a northern v age ot one hundred inhabitants that ha> not bett? r roads leading from it thau the city of Tl aebir.gtoa, with a i>opulation of 12i),>i00.

Weproioseto rtler to this matter again. ? ':ir telegrams from Kuropc by cable to-dav are very tull, being the accumulation since d?v before yesterday; and though somewhat con Ri?th?g they throw a groat deal of light on the situation. In the tret pla-e the pacific attitude ?>t Kns-m seems to have allayed the ar.pr.-hen stors or a g.-neral war to grow out orthe Eastern ?1 ue^tion. tor tbe present at least. In the ne*t l-lsce the fact seems to be established that G. n. I ?e Palladioe. from whom ?o much was expected by tbe French, evacuated Orleans aa untenable, and retreated with his army or 200,010 mon. thus crushing all hoj.es of a junction of the army ot tbe I.oire with Trochu's forces. The tone' ot tbe dispatches from inside I*ari> are Mill hype ful. but to the outside world it looks as if the situation, bears oat the progna*ticati.iiij a* to a M ecdy end of tbe war, which ta ist come with t. e tall ot Paris. and that event, it is prophesied in London, will take place within three week*. 11"e graphic and singularly interesting narra tive given by -John H. Surratt or his career, a-id ft the bi.-torv of tLe abduction p?ot and the a satsir.ai.onplot, to be found t'sewhere in The >tak, will undoubtedly attract general atten tion. It was delivered in a lecture by Sarratt at Kochvrie, Md.. last night, and the feat of re- I porting ft in full and expressing It to the citv ! tor I tie Star of to-day wa> one costing labor i and m. bp v.
