FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7,1883. •.-.. ifliim ACTION. iii Wi tfalik the time has Arrived when tlw fonaera ot the Northwest should •V upon Agitation alone as a MHtpiy4 (or the cruel wrongs which tMiykave been'compelled to endure at thftlMnrli of one of the most unacrupu kqffftonopolles that ever fastened its •:'!"gii^. upon a helpless country. It is title, there were doubts existing in the aalwls of many as to the real extent of Ike frost and whether or not wheat liiighUy totalled by frost was capable \«f producing the highest grade of flour. But there W now no room for doubt that farmers all over the Northwe.it fliave been robbed by a systematic iriie of dishor.e it" grading on tlie part wheat buyers. It is a fact beyond ipute that the very best quality of iql wheat is being discounted one or grades at all the elevators on the ihsy pretext of "frost bitten." But tlie question now calmly to tie |eowdaered is, What can be dons in the ,f»y of providing a remedy for these grievances and securing to the farmo price for wheat something near commensurate with its local market Value! Is there any lever that can he 90t.bold of that will place farmers in a position that they may not be alto gbtherat the mercy of an unssrupu 1-Hit conspiracy between tHs railroads «l|d the Miller'a Association! Individ Wd protests and aimless agitation will accomplish nothing. It will do no good for each farmer to hold an indig nation meeting by himself. United «fbtt on some feasible line of action canakrae be effectual in gaining the desired end. Nor is it the work of a day. The interests that are to be famed are powerful and any move ment organised to oppose them must hwto vitality and permanence. Before anytoncerted action is undertaken we must reckon on a long light and a strong one, if any practical, permanent good is to grow out of it. Before proposing any plan let us con eider some well known facts. & The railroad company and Miller's •Association arc run for the enrich mailt of a few persons, who have dera onatrated their determination to bleed tlie-eountry as far as they can without provoking dangerous opposition. Their golden opportunity is when WW atid ties have not been formed that bind together older eomauinities when farmers, as a class, •re ptwr.and org'.:iizo'.l opposition diOcult. 3. These companies will pay no regard to the remonstrances of a poor man,'but when a man of wealth and influence demands, on sufficient a concession or redress he will generally get it. it The history of other sections of tKi country, similarly situated, as Illinois, Wisconsin and other states, ptoves that concerted effort persist ently carried on will wring from monopolies almost any reosonable con ,,®esslon. The farmen of this country were f|^yta,year entitled to an average of ai flftcen cents a bushel for their than they were compelled 3Tjcci^ l^^iiig~an abundant margin to buyers and the railroad company tJt handling and carrying. We tuk our farmers and business mto to carefully consider these state ments. If they are facts—and we do not think we have overdrawn the sit nMtcn-r then some movement should He inaugurated at once to protect our interest*. It is in vain that the coun ter itself upon immun ity from tornadoes and grasshoppers if they are left only a bare chance to sub :»llea few capitalists amass their bom one season's crop.

It I* quite a different thing to get it passed, h«w jver. In most cases it requires a powerful lobby or an all-powerful pub tic sentiment to crowd it on to the last stage. The question of the day is "What can the farmers do to protect their in terests from the baleful effects of op pre.'.sive monopolies and insure a fair return for honest lalror!" Can they unite iu any practicable line of effort? The best advise we can give is: First, agitate Second, be sure you are rigLt Third, go ahead. Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, has presented a joint resolution for an imendment to the constitution, pro hunting the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors. The bill pro vides, that should the amendment not lie ratified by three-fourths, of the states before 1890, it shall then become law by act of Congress. Tlia Boston One Price Clothing House, of St. Paul, have recently pub lislied a pipor for distribution amongst their friends and customers all over the Northwest.

Postmaster General Gresham has made a brave fight against the Louisi ana lottery swindle, but the odds are tikely against him. The lottery com bination has millions of money to spend in influencing Congress and pro vidlng means to evade the law. The whole country must take a rest some day from all other questions and turn' ing upon this gigantic swindle clear out root and branch. C. S. Hulbert is rnit in a card defending the course pursued by his company in buying wheat. He would have the people to believe that the P. 4 H. elevator system has nothing to lo with the Minneapolis Millers' Asso ciation and that his company is not in illusion with any railroad. It would seem discourteous to question the ver acity of an apparently honorable gen tleman, but there is cumulative evi tlence of great injustice somewhere ind it is impossible to see how the P. A H. company can be free from com plicity in it. 

COB8E8POODENCB. Mltor FloKltx-ExrBEM: Sir.—1 wiBh to callvour attention to matters involving the interests of not a few sittlere in this county. We have in each county in this Territory a clerk of the district court, appointed by the judge of the district, whose duty requires him to hold his office at the county seat and t'lere attend to the duties of said office. The law also provides that he mar appoint a deputy to act in hiB absence or when he is unable to attend to the duties of said office, who has no more author ity, however, than his principal. The U. S. land luws provide that par ties desirous of settling on government land can appear at the district land office ind there make the affidavit requisite, for a homestead entry also, the neces sary affidavit for final proo£ But if through distance from the land office 6r disability from any cause the claimant cannot rcach the land office, he may nppear before the clerk cf the district court for the county, who is required to hold his office at the county seat and takes the required affidavit. But wiiere docs the law in any case give the district clerk a special commis sion to appoint deputies at will to Uavel through the county for the purpose of taking final proofs? Again, final proofs are advertised to be made befo« the clerk of the court at Pembina, when there is an express un derstanding that he or one of his depu ties will go to claimant's residence or sotne other convenient place, frequently many miles distant from the county seat and there take the testimony of claim ant and witnesses in some cases. Now, 8ir, what is the object of a notice of final proof? I should suppose it is that the public should know at what time and place parties are making final proof, so that if any one has any objection itcan be submitted then, and it is supposed and intended tbst they should be made public, so that any one can have an op portunity of knowing what the witnesses are testifying to. I should like to ask what opportunity has the public of know ing what is going on when a proof is advertised in one place and taken in another, fifty miles away? In this way the clerk of the district court is practising a deception upon the land department by representing that proofs were made before him at hisoffice in Pembina, when they were not Robust Kwura.
