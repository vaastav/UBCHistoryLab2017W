SUBSCRIPTI0N-S5.00 PER ANNUM STATE PARK "HAVEN OF FORESTRY. Todd County Argus- Two years ago a bill was slipped through the legislature turning over the control of Itasca park to the Forestry com mission. As soon as the commis sion secured control it decided to use the hotel, built to entertain summer tourists, as a forestry school and some twenty-five students have been up there all the summer. Itasca park is a beautiful summer resort and the people in this part of the state object to having it turned into a school for twenty or twenty-five students who could study forestry in some other place as well. Properly managed the park could be made a resort that will attract thousands of tourists dur ing the summer. The mainten ance of such a resort would be of great value to the people in that section in a financial way and would be a good advertisement for the state as well. Friction between the commission and R. A. Arnold, the park commissioner, has resulted in the resignation of the latter.

SENDS MESSAGETOSENATE In Transmitting Report of War De- partment on Brownsville Affair the President Briefly Comments on Re- sult of Investigation and Makes Rec- ommendations for Reinstatement of Some of the Men. Washington, Dec. 15.In transmit ting the war department's report on the Brownsville affair to the senate President Roosevelt accompanied the document with a brief message on the subject. After the reading of the president's message had been con cluded the cierk read all of the state ments and other evidence submitted to the war department, for which the president's message was merely a letter of transmittal. This is contrary to the usual course. The message fol lows To the Senate: I enclose heiewith a letter from the secretary of war transmitting a report of the investigation made by Mr. Her bert J. Browne, employed by the de partment in conjunction with Captain W. G. Baldwin to investigate as far as possible what happened at Browns ville on the 13th and 14th of August, 1906. The report and documents con tain some information of great value and some statements that are obvi ously worthless, but I submit them in their entirety. This report enables us to fix with tolerable definiteness at least some of the criminals who took the lead the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville. It establishes clearly the fact that the colored sol diers did the shooting but upon this point further record was unnecessary, as the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting has already been established beyond all possibility of doubt. The investigation has not gone far enough to enable us to de termine all the facts and we will pro ceed with it but it has gone far enough to determine with sufficient accuracy certain facts of enough im portance to make it advisable that I place the report before you. Has No Doubt of Their Guilt. It appears that almost all the mem bers of Company must have been actively concerned in the shooting, either to the extent of being partici pants or to the extent of virtually en couraging those who were partici pants. As to Companies and there can be no question that prac tically every man in them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of troop and possibly by one or two oth ers in one of the other troops. This concealment was itself a grave of fense, which was greatly aggravated by their testifying before the senate committee that they were ignorant of what they must have known. Never theless, it is to be said in partial ex tenuation that they Were probably cowed by threats, made by the more desperate of the men who had actually been engaged in the shooting, as to what would happen to any man who failed to protect the wrongdoers Moreover, there are circumstances tending to show that these misguided men were encouraged by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment and denial I feel, therefore, that the guilt of the men who, after the event, thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by refusing to tell the truth i though serious, was in jf-aif d'iO the unwise and improper arntt d oi others and that some nvasiuo o[ llowance should be made fci thp misr mduct. Coirlit'oirords, of Reinstatement. I believe we can 1 i 'istate any of these men "i wilfully tell what has hap pened, give all the aid they can to fix the responsibility upon those who are really guilty and show that they themselves had no guilty knowledge beforehand and were in no way impli cated the affair, save by having knowledge of it afterwards and fail ing and refusing to divulge it. Under the circumstances, and in view of the length of time they have been out of the service and their loss of the ben efit that would have accrued to them by continuous long time service, we can afford to treat the men who meet the requirements given above as hav ing been sufficiently punished by the consequences they brought upon themselves when they rendered nec essary the exercise of the disciplinary power. I recommend that a law be passed allowing the secretary of war, withm a fixed period of June,, say, 

DEFECTIVE PAGE year, to reinstate "any"*"of these ~30ij diers whom he, after careful examine* tion, finds to have been innocent and whom he finds to have done all in his power -to help bring justice to the guilty. Meanwhile the investigation will b continued. The results have made it that only by carrying on the Investigation as the war department has actually carried it on is there the slightest chance of bringing the offenders to justice or of separating not the innocent, for there were doubt less hardly any innocent, bat the less guilty from those whose guilt was heinous.

CAMPAIGN FOR A "CLEANER PRESS" Movement Has Backing of Prom inent New Yorkers. New York, Dec. 15.With the start of the Hains trial at Flushing, L. I., a campaign for a "cleaner press' has been inaugurated in New York with the hope of inducing newspapers to eliminate from their columns anything that might be suggestive or offensive. The move has been started by an open letter of three prominent men who declare that they have the sup port of Archbishop Farley, Bishop Greer, Jacob H. Schiff, the banker and financier, Robert W. de Forest and others. The co-operation of tlio public is invited and while there is no desire, it is said, to "censor" the news it is believed that a campaign along proper lines will be effective. The letter, after deploring the publication of "libidinous details of criminality," with special reference to the Thaw case, says: "It is believed by good authorities that a respectful protest presented early enough to the press by men of serious character, representing heavy responsibilities in the care of their own children or children confided to them by the duties of their positions in life, will meet with an immediate and sympathetic response, resulting in such careful editing of this and similar news matter that no harm shall be done to the reading com munity by indecently offensive sug gestion."

OFFICIAL NOTE IS ISSUED Capture of Guardship a Protest Against the Personal Rule of Pres- ident Castro and in Order to Guar- antee Itself Against a Renewal of Former Molestations of Dutch Ves- sels by Venezuela. The Hague, Dec. 15.The govern ment of The Netherlands is satisfied that it was quite within its rights, from the standpoint of international law, in seizing the Venezuelan coast guardship Alix off Puerto Cabello. The Alix was suspected of carrying munitions of war from one Venezu elan port to another. Similar reprisals will be taken whenever and_wherever possible. The government has issued an offi cial statement in connection with the seizure of the Alix, in which it sets forth that it is taking action against the personal rule of President Castro in order to guarantee itself against a renewal of former molestations of Dutch vessels, this being a point con cerning which Castro refused to give any assurances. 

WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT Dutch Cruiser Captures Venezuelan Guardship. Willemstad, Island of Curacao, Dec. 15.The following detailed story of the capture of the Venezuelan coast guardship Alix by the Dutch cruiser Gelderland was obtained from an offi cer of the cruiser: The Gelderland was steaming slow ly a short distance off the fort at Puerto Cabello. She noticed the Alix coming in and after taking up a posi tion that prevented the passage of the smaller boat she ordered her to stop and sent off a boat to search the Venezuelan vessel. It was discovered that the captain of the Alix had hid den his Venezuelan pennant in his pocket and he pretended that his ves sel was a merchant steamer. A pas senger on board the Alix, however, declared to the Dutch officers that the Ah\ was a coastguard vessel A search was then made. The flag was found in the captain's pocket and six rifles and a small quantity of ammuni tion also were discovered. The rifles were in bad condition. The crew of the Alix were given their choice of coming to Curacao or going ashore at Puerto Cabello. They preferred the latter course, embarked in one of their own boats and pulled into the harbor. The Venezuelan gunboat Restaura dor was at Puerto Cabello and the officers of the Gelderland could see her getting up steam. Smoke was pouring from her funnels. The Gel derland stayed outside Puerto Cabello for several hours waiting to see if the Restaurador would come out, but she did not venture forth. The Gelderland manned the Alix with an officer and several marines and towed her into Curacao. She is now anchored in the inner bay. NOTE TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS Venezuela Protests Against Action of Dutch Warships. Caracas, Venezuela, Dec. 15.For- eign Minister Paul has sent a note to the members of the diplomatic corps here protesting against the "repeated violations of the territorial rights of Venezuela" by the three Dutch war ships that have been cruising in Ven ezuelan waters since Dec. 2. No blockade has been declared, he sets forth, and the continual interference with the coastwise shipping is having a detrimental effect upon the com merce of neutral powers. In conclu sion the foreign minister says: "Venezuela protests with energy against these aggressions upon the territorial sovereignty of the republic and she holds Holland responsible for all the consequences." Holland Keeps Plans Secret. Washington, Dec 15.Holland's ul timate forcible designs against Ven ezuela, if she has finally determined on them, the initial steps of which appear to have been the seizure of a coast guardship, are still a mystery to the state department, as that gov ernment has not yet seen fit to make the United States acquainted with Ihem. Holland apparently has mapped its course alone, avoiding any act that might give cause for complaint from any of the powers having interests in Venezuela or interfering with vested rights there. Primary Law Constitutional. Chicago, Dec. 15.That the new di rect primary law of Illinois, under which all state and county officers were nominated last August, is con stitutional was affirmed by Judge Mc Burely in the criminal court of Cook county.
