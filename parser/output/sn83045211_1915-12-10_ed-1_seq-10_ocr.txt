EXPECTS ANTAGONISM. litclJnp tho nntasonlsm of the raf(lcsl! Mr. Garrison devotes a larce patj of hlS' report to mcctliiB the nriiument, yhlch he .'says will be ad vanced asrainst liLi pollrfei. The details of tho... Garrison military program previously -have beenTrtado pub lic Briefly, tho plnn calls for tho In crnnso of tho regular army to HI.CO0 offi cers and men. A reserve to be known as itlio "Continental Army" would be raited In three Instalments of 133,000 men eaolu These reservists would servo sK ycaVa, three tUq .first with the colors, dur-Inri-whlch they would receive annual In tcnelvo training In Held camps. With the plan In complete operation the Conti nental Army would always comprise 400. 000 j men with the colors. The regular irniy of 111,000 nnd a national guard of H3.S0O more would bring tho cntlro mill-tar- torccs up to 670,000. Last year Congress appropriated $115. O0O.0QO for military' purposes. As previ ously disclosed by Secretary Garrison, hlaplan when In complete operation at Unwind of four years would call for an anfflUkl expenditure of $182,000,000. a joi-t ron nuYAN. Mr. Bryan'B opposition to mllltnry force receives this Jolt In almost tho opening paragraph of Secretary Garrison's report: "Tho necessity or a nation having a Xorco commensurate with Its responsibil ity is demonstrated by every -correct process- of reasoning founded upon fact. This 13 so whether the subject Is consid ered In tho light of tho philosophy of government or of history. The use of force Is tho Inherent essenco of govern ment. The very term itself Is explicit government tho right or power to com pel obedience to law. Where thero is no force to compel such obedience thnt Is, to govern there Is anarchy. Individuals sHup the right of unregulated actions when they form themselves Into or be corho subject to a government. Tho prog ress nnd advancement of that which Is summed up In the word 'civilization' have been mado possible holelv because of government. Unless tho Individual Is so curq In his person and his property ho has- neither time nor Inclination to de voto himself to the cultivation of the incritoli moral or spiritual side of his na ture. That security Is secured to him by -sovernment. and government can only meet Its responsibility of assurance by tho possession of sufficient force to se cure nnd preserve It." Holding to the ancient prophecy that thero would bo wnrs nnd rumors of wars, nnd that nation would rise asnlnst nation and kingdom against kingdom. Secretary Garrison boldly asserts that "weakness inevitably results In overthrow, ns tho nbtuidnnt Instances of history demon strate, both with respect to Individuals, cities and nations." Continuing Mr. Gar rison says, "If we should properly pre- paro our minds to be strong, so that wo can reject evil, we should likewise make our physical force strong In order that wo may maintain the right as against thoso who would physically Impose the wrong upon us." Mr. Garrison declares that those who reajly fear militarism should bo thfi strongest advocates of reasonable prepa ration as "tho preventive of militarism." He. moreover, asserts that the sensible advocate of preparedness does not claim that preparedness prevents war. He says, however, that it tends to prevent war, and In many Instances has been demon strated to have prevented It "rUGHTDOKRS MUST PREPARE." "So long as right and wrong exist In thef world," continues Mr. Garrison, "llfero will bo an inevitable conflict be tween them. The rlghtdoera must be pre pared to protect and defend the right as against the wrong. Their preparation will tend to prevent tho triumph of wrong, and In those Instances In which It does not prevent tho pttempt It can pre vent the sjccesa of the attempt. Wisdom demanda precaution; precaution demands preparation; preparation la Bgainst the day of evil from any quarter." Mr Garrison lane plain Issue with those who hold that the cause of arbitration will ha advanced "if wo re frain, frpm adopting a proper military policy but will be set back, if we do so. "This belief," he says, "seems to rest upon the idea that If we are feeble and weak In action, we will be strong nnd pessuasive in counsel, that by avowedly neglecting to prepare to. protect our rights we will be better able to secure their protection by appeal, by arbitra tion or by argument Aa showing our present woeful un priparedness Mr. Garrison points out that all, be nation posseises outside the stand ing army is "a statute prescribing how volunteers may be raised In tha event of war" He contrasts this with the proposed system under which the country Would have a forte "already organized, already clothed and armed and officered, wh,jcb bas- been to a certain extant disciplined and trained " and declares tb "advantage thereof over the other s!tuattpn is literally Incalculable " He does, not maintain that a few months' ttalnlns will make a continental soldier (ht.(fiiia! ot a reguU but contrasts tho H'WO.Btfge of a complete organization evtr no organization, of reserves all, as nt present Child Falls Into a Bonfire A, i ycar-old child is In a critic pfta , dfipn I th Heuiylvanla lliiayltat to ssy from hums rectlvtd last pisbt, when ,-ij;t-t"T-4 mi fn l frpif which it' r'-.fart-n u? mU- , Swansea k r - -r-Sft,' ; 7,4gF&db-tfa.nn 10 $10,000,000 TO

SOCIALISTS APPROVE CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH rnntlnunl from Page One learned from Kntento ecclesiastics at the recent Conslntory. In n letter to tho press, William Jen nings Brynn declares tho tlmo Is ripe for tho United States to mediate be tween tho warring nations. UERLIN. Dec. 10. At n meeting of the Social Democratic Labor party today, which was attended by a majority of tho members, resolu tions were adopted declaring that Chan cellor von Bcthmann-Hollwcg's nnswer to the Interpellation of Doctor Scbeidcmann was satisfactory, as it Bhowed the Ger man Government had no desire to annex territory. Party leaders In the nelchstag today expressed unanimous npproval of the German Government's nttltude toward pence as set forth by Dr. von Bcthmann Hollwcg, the Imperial Chancellor, nt Thursday's session. They emphnslzed the willingness ex pressed by tho Chancellor to discuss any terms that the Allies might offer which would be compatible with Germany's dignity nnd safety. They were virtually unanimous In declaring that responsi bility for the war "must rest upon the Allies in the future as It has In tho past." In no circles In Berlin, however. Is there nny hope that the Entente Powers will proposo peace terms. The general opinion 'a thut the Allies, relying upon their re sources, will coiitlnuo tho wnr. In tho uxpectntlon that Germany will ultimate ly be overthrown. Prominent political chieftains, even thoso who had before the war opposed tho Government, said today that the speech of Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg would weld all elements of the German nation Into a unit firm for defense ot the fatherland. "The Chancellor's speech was pleasing tc all Germany," said Herr Basserman, a leader of tho National Liberals. "It could not have been nny different. It Is not possible nt present to go Into impos sible peace details, but the Impression must go atound the world that Germany is willing to conclude a favorable peaco and at all times accept sensible propos als." Doctor von Heiydebrand, a leader of the Conservative party, declare! emphatic ally that all peace overtures must come from Germany's enemies. Baron von RIchthoven, a National Lib eral leader, who was formerly attached to tho German Embassy at Washington, said that the Chancellor's Bpeech should have a marked effect on public opinion In neutral countries. "The peace discussion will show the world that Germany Is peacefully Inclined and never wanted a war of conquest," he said. 

TI3IE PROPOSITIONS FOR U. S. MEDIATION, MtYAN SAYS NEW YORK, Dec. 10,-Now Is the time for the American Government to take steps looking to peace in Europe, In the opinion of William Jennings Bryan, In a letter sent to the editor of a New York newspaper, the former Secretary of Btate sas; "I believe that the President, either alone or in co-operation with the execu tives of other neutral countries, could se cure from the belligerent nations a state ment ot the terms demanded, and this would be the beginning ot an exchange of views which doubtless would lead to a treaty, "It looks now as If the belligerent, na tions were more willing than heretofore to consider the question of peace, but neu tral nations need not necessarily await until mediation is solicited by either side."

While tho Chancellor's speech Just now Is the overshadowing topic of discussion, It la a fact that ofllclnls and the Berlin public are almost as much Interested In the attack mado by President Wilson In his message to Congress on certain for-clgn-born citizens of the United States. It Is accepted here that the remarks wcro directed at German-Americans nnd Austro-Amerlcans. German officials pro fess to be unable to understand the Presi dent's viewpoint. One admiralty official declared today that ho could not help believing that Washington was unfriendly to Germany. 

HOSTILITY AND SARCASM IN LONDON PRESS COMMENT LONDON, Dec. 10. Angry comments In tho London press today on the German Chancellor's speech were mingled with sarcastic shots nnd declarations that "tho Chancellor merely repeated the old bluff nnd brag." "He had tho temerity to warn us that the longer the war continues the harder will be tho German terms of peace." said tho Dally Express, "and this In tho face of common knowledge that Germany Is necessarily growing weaker every day and less able to carry out tho grandiose plans of her rulers. "If there was a long-sighted statesman In Germany, he would contrive to arrive at a settlement that would leave his coun try powerful nnd menacing." The Chromclo answered the German So cialist, Doctor Scheldemann, who declared Europe would bo ruined if the wnr con tinued, and thnt the only victor would be the United States. 'That, of course, Is a reflection which Germany might have well taken to heart before plunging Europe Into the war," said the Chronicle, "but It Is not nn argu ment for stopping the war at the moment when Its ending would be most advanta geous to those who provoked It. "Tho Allies do not regard Germany as Invincible, nnd will not do so any the more because Bethmann-Hollweg asserts It." ENTENTE CAPITALS GREET SPEECH WITH REBUFFS LONDON, Dec. 10. In all the capitals of the Entente Pow ers the peace talk of Doctor von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German Chancellor, met with stern rebuffs today. The attitude of the Allied Governments Is summed up In this laconic phrase: "We are determined to tight It out on this line if It takes 10 years." In their official circles it is considered that the best answer to the German Chancellor is the fact that even now the war chiefs ot the allied countries are planning fresh campaigns by land and sea. Premier Asqulth of England, Premier Brland of Franco, Premier Goremykln of Russia and Premier Salandra of Italy are a unit upon the question of peare. They believe that Germany has already passed the climax ot her military achieve ment and that the peace talk of Doctor von Bethmann-Hollweg Is an effort to bring up the question of terms while Germany is at the zenith of her achieve ment.
