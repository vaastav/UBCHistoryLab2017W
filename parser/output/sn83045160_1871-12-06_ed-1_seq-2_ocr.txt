THIS MEMPHIS DAILY APPEAL-WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1871. lEHPmS APPEAL OFFICIAL JOURNAL OF THE CI i f . WEDNESDAY MORNINB, : : DEC. 6, 1871 FOB KiTW, JOHN JOHNSON. The Call on Mayor Johnson. All persons having lists of the signature ol those who request Msyor Johnson to announce himself a candidate for re-ele-tlon will send them to the appkal efflce to-day, that they may appear alphabeti cally arranged to-morrow. Any name may thus be instantly found, and the Ap pkal containing the list may well be pre served for Juture reference. Those who bare hot and wish to sign this call, will at onoe send their names to this office. sr ty testl- No Mass Meeting. Such is the popular unanimity in behalf of Mr. Johnson's re-election that the con templated mass meeting will not be held. press, we have been furnished with the following correspondence by dispatches which triumphantly exonerates Msyor Johnson from the foul slanders which have been oonoooted for his destruction: Memphis.

Nashville. December 5, 1871. Hon. John Johnson Certainly the tes timony of William Farrington expressly exonerates vou from any complicity in Memphis city coupon transaction. J. M. COULTER. Bitter, Indeed, must be the malignity which fabricates charges so baseless for the purpose of destroying an honeat citi- rsn and a faithful and efficient officer. It is the duty of the public to rebuke this oatrsce by rallying to the support of th man who has been so grossly outraged and wronged. This first e flirt to crush Msyor Johnson by cslumny upon his in tegrity having failed, we may expect an other equally as groundless, if not more infsmous. It is hoped for the sake of hu manity that the conspirators, routed and disgraced In their shameful effort to slan der down an honest man, will be more cautious in their facts when they make another experiment. OrUISli OF 1 HE PUSH a. TBI CALX VPOB JM'Ha JOHKbOK TUB Dl'lT OF TaaJE HOCK. The attention of the convention, which mceta to-day, is directed to the call pub lished thia morning urging Mayor John son to announce, himsell as s candidate form ayor. We understand the mayoi will respond to the call to morrow, and we earnestly hope he will oonatn; to the use of his name. Indeed we cannot aee how he can resist such an unanimous appeal for his servi ces. The rule of the majority is the essence of Dtmccrtcy, and If those who constitute the convention, to be held to-day, are not deaf and blind they will discover that John Johnten is the choice of a large msjority of the people of Mem phis, and no longer interpose any obsta cle to the election of a man who is unmis takably the choice of an overwhelming majority. The popular masses have pro nounced in favor of John Johnson, not only on the streets, in their shops and offices but with their own written signa tures. In deference to the unmtetak able voice of the people the mass meeting has been abandoned, and ii the convention to-day would heed and respect the same unerring and omnipotent tribunal, it will simply ratify the popular will by nominating John Johnaon lor mayor, and thus unite and harmonise the people, aave the city from t;e baneful influences of unprofitable squabbles, and thereby contribute to the good name and prosperity of Memphis, If the Appeal were actuated by selfish mo tives, it would goad the enemies of Mayor Johnaon, and strive to force a contest which would result to Its advantage. But we are ready to sink our own interests for the public good, and hope the convention to-day will do nothing to mar that una nlmlty which seems to pervade the pub lic mind for the re-election of John John eon. Among the list of dele gel es we reoagn:z9 the names of many good and true men eld citizens of influence and integrity, and who have long labored for the prosperity of Memphis. To them we would appeal. Aa mayor of Memphis, John Johnson will, in the future ss in the past, administer the laws, and be guided only by honesty j ustice and equity in all things, and unto all men. With the hope of promoting harmony, the mass meet ing, to which there was much objection, has been abandoned, and since it is so ev ident that the people desire to re-elect the present incumbent without the aid of any formal nomination, we trust the convention to-day will respect the popu lar clamor and avoid any act which will produce bickerings and discord, es trangements snd excitements, without re suiting In sny corresponding good to party, Individuals or the prosperity of the "y. The West Tennessee Plaindcaltr ssya that In the present shapeless condition of parties there should be an editorial con ventlon, cons stlng of editors opposed to tbe re-electlcnof Orsnt. The New York World, of tbe 1st instant, says it "favors any policy, "passive" or active, which may give the best promise of defeating rant and electing an honest statesman in his place.'' The New Orleans Timet aays that nothing would be easier than to effect a resistless combination of lorcea against Orsnt, "if It were not for s silly s-ntimentalism, or the greed and ambi tion of party leaders, who spprehend they will lose their Importance and prestige in sny new organisation of parties." The Memphis Ledger aays that the list of dead presidentisl candidates in tbe Democratic party is large. Hoffman was a year since prominent, snd hsd his hoet of friends. Pendleton snd Hendricks have disappeared. John Quincy Adama ia not now spoken ot Others hare gone the same way. There Is not now a prominent D-mocrat in the field. Tom Scott la the last experiment, but made no great sensstion Public opinion among the masses of Democrats baa been for some time drifting toward the policy of Inaction and to the ultimate sup port of a Republican in opposition to Grant. And so, sfter the destruction of the prospects of s Democratic candidate, the question is narrowed down to an ami Grant Republican. Before next July the lide may .turn. No one can tell. The Democratic lookout is very dark. The republicans have now an opportunity of quarreling to the content of their hearts The ouly hope the Democrats have is in the disruption of that party. It Is a despe rate one,but It may be realized. If the Rad icals possessed a little of the magnanimity which ia common to civillzsd oommunl ties, they would, now that their power Is undisputed, proclaim a general amnesty, declare pesos, snd invite the South to re entor tbe councils of the country. They can well afford to do that. It would strengthen and secure their triumph. But they possess no magnanimity. Having grown rich ami powerful by robbing and abusing the South, they have no intention of discontinuing their programme. And so our Democratic presidential lights are going out one by one, and taking their places with the dead Issues of the country. Tuey are Buffering the penalty ot being just, honest and Christian. Tuey are fine men, but tbe people of the North do not want fine men. ASS. Tbe President'a message evidently shows the handiwork of Trumbull. There Is infected Into it, as sn approved proposi tion, every argument employed by oon- errat1tn aminei the conduct of the President. Greet, after uaing hia own position and the offices of the country ss agencies for the aggregation about himself of sit the knavoa in America, now pro nounces unutterable maledictions against thieves. Having enriched himself and the Dent family, he would, in obedience to the" country's demands, exelude vil lainy and Incompetency from office. He accepts all thst has been said against himself and his appointees as true, end then would surround himself with plaoe- men, first subjected to sn examination to fitness and capacity to bold office " du ring good behavior." The leading pur pose of the message is therefore the con ciliation oi Radical leaders, who hsve re cently made war upon tbe administration. Clearly, It Is Grant's snd the purpose of his advisers to make tbe South and the war with the South the great issue In the coming presidential contest. It hi ever been the winning card, and will not now be rejected. If Grant has succeeded In excluding ether issues and in making Akerman'a boarted report upon ku-klnxism tbe great question before the country, these States may be denied" participation In the presidential elec tion; northern prejudices will approve the act; the purpose of cresting the ku klnx committee will be attained; the northern Democracy will be pronounced apologists of the "rebellion;" iresh vigor will be infused into passions begotten by war; and the political and pract cal for tunes of the South will be sacrihoed that a party may triumph.

The Henry county Democrat, of the 22d icstast, says the first engine for the Kan sas City and Memphis railroad arrived at tbe depot in that city (Clinton) last week. The road is now supplied with an engine and a number of flit cars, and ss soon ss the rails arrive (they having already been purchased), the track-laying will com mence. J he ties are cut anu strewn along tbe road south from this place to Osceola, and the road-bed having been made ready, there la nothing lurther to do but to go to work and lay tbe ties and put the Iron down. When this is accomplished our citizens will hare the gratification of see ing the first erjglne snd cars lsunched upon the Kansas City and Memphis road, which la deatined to be one of the moat important railroad enterprises in the Union. One hundred miles of tbe road will be in operation within tbe next three months. In view of these fac.s, some one should attend to that little matter of leg islation wanted, and let us put Colonel Beaumont, Eidridge and others in the field ai thia end ol the line. There ia no time to bo lost, and tbis city, with a trust worthy msyor, can accomplish sny task, BLANKETS witchell, hoffman co, -ALSO MANUFACTURERS OF AJA.

There la an innate feeling in the breast of every honcrable man to ahteld and defend a good citizen when outraged ! calumny. Thia noble instinct developed Itself ytsterdsy when th people of Mem phla almost unanimously arose snd re pelled with indignation and scorn the at tempt to blast the reputation ot John Johnaon, by the publication, in one ot tht morning papers, of a dispstch from Nash Tille, Insinuating and suggesting dlahon est on tbe part of our mayor. We re ceived a similar dispatch to the one which made Its appearance, but believing i-s publication would do gross injustice to an honeat man, and knowing that our cor respondent would not lend himself to sn Intentional wrong to Msyor Johnson. we neglected publishing the informs-ion Tbe result has shown tbe wisdom of our precaution, tor there never was s fouler lander or s more atrocious calumny uttered against a cltisen than thst made against John Johnaon, in charg Ing him with being implicated iu the purchase ot Memphis coupons f f it the Stste. We called upou the msyor at sn early hour yesterday morning, snd directed his attention to tbe pu bllsted dispatch, snd to the one ad dressed to tbe A r peal but suppressed. Wltb that indignation which mcves an honest and conscientious man unjustly ssaailed, Mayor Johnson denounced the shsrge In whole snd in part, in general and in particular, aa an arrant and unmiti gated slander. The dispatches from Nssbville give our esteemed tellow-clll-sen, W. M. Farrington, aa the authority for Implicating Mayor Johnson in the purchase of city coupons. But It will be seen from the following card that Mr. Farrington promptly and ncquallnsdiy exonerates Msyor Johnson from all con nection with the matter: Tbe Appeal la not more an organ of public opinion ss evolved in Tennessae than in Mississippi, Arkansas and Ala bama. Two of tnese States are scenes of lawless despotism snd of endless outrages, practiced by local and Federal masters. Txiere Is no temporary sacrifice we would not make to secure a change of rulers at Washington by which Mississippi and Arkanssa may be relieved of the domina Hon of tyrants and thieves. In TVi n -ssee there is no local reason for any adaptation of partisan action or polloy to exl gsnciea of our national condition Tneae local necessities are, how over, recognised everywhere in the North, and by many leading Southern j mruals. Thsretore sn or snlsuion o! honesty and patriotlam against despot ism aud villainy, haa been proposed and widely popularised. Seeing and confess log the dsnger ot such a combination, Grant's advisers have injected into his message, as published in yesterday's Ap i'kal propositions contemplating many refomslnthe conduct of public affairs But tbe South and the condition of the South oonatltutea the cynosure around which tbe hopes of Ksdicalism still clus ter. The horrors of kukluxism snd the progress of the " rebellion in Siuth Carolina and other Southern Slates," snd Akerman'a report will furnish the bar-- of Rsdiosl strength (s shown by the President's messsge, in tbe next presidential campaign. Tne South inui-t again be victimized, and, against Democracy Oiant aeeks to array ail the prejudices begotten by tbe conflict be tween the States. Such is tbe general partisan aspect of the message. Grant even assents to the non-recognition of the Fourteenth Amendment, snd would fur ther strengthen the central power and augment Its patronage by making the tel egrapb part of the postal system. In his next message, and for the same reasons, he would control, as Is proposed to be done by the government of Bngland, the rallwaya ol the continent. TOM 

SCOTT HEADED OFF. The necessity to which New York (in fact, all commercial cities) are eurj acted, involving the construction oi a Southern Pacific road, is shown by facts given by the telegraph dispatches given this morn ing. A tram left Omsha day before yes terday ; It was caught in a snow-bank, and could neither go weat nor east. Two locomotives sent to the relief of the first were also frozen to the rail?, snd in any winter of ordinary severity the Union Pacific road becjmes as useless as the Erie canal at this moment. Memphis is point, on the map, on an sir-line from New York to Shreveport. Tom Scctt has discovered this fact, and already It believes it cheaper to build tbe Southern Pacific han to shovel anow through all time and freeze passengers to death on ths Union Pacific Tom Soott can pocket stocks overthrow railroad kings, breakfast at Louisville on s great bridge, startle Grant and go through a legislature like croton oil, bat he can't cork up the snow storms thst make hia trans-oonlinentil road val ueless as a stock investment and for all commercial purposes In winter. He must have a southern hlghwsy to the Pacific, and cross the Mississippi st Memphis. Furs, Furs! IS ALL VARIETIES, AT KEW YORK PRICES, Suitable for Christmas Presents. MENKEN BROS. Cor.
