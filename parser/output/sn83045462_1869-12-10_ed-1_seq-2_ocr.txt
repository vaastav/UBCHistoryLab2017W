[ EVENING STAR Larffst Cirrnlation in the District 4 ROMR Y H. MO YES. F.dltor. WASHINGTON CITY: I RIOAY Dmmbfr 10, IMS. Reading Matter on Every Page. Mr. 1 rnmbnir*"Kmaarlpslion Rill." The Tr,'>*? >ij le.> Senator TrumVjII'b bill prohibiting interference by Cougr<'mnien in th- matter of af>t>o ntm<Mit? to office " a bHl to rnanritiate Conitv-- from borp*." If ||>a>?ed. the Trtbunr thinks tilt bill will Mt only I rot;*ct Orpmarn mJ ?l<p%rtment ?l!icfri from a Muding Mwnifi-. b:it it will f<>rm the tpvring wiilgc to the parage of a Civil Serricc Mil, or at lea.-t the adoption by the civil fcerrircoi a policyof making all appointment* *n<l removals strictlv with a view to secure the t><-f performance of official duty, and not for the pnrpose of rewarding anyltody "? friends or puni-li ng an> body's enemiev. We suspect that the great drawback to the parage of either Mr. Trumbull** bill or the Civil Service bill will be from the indisposition of Congressmen to )?eld the localfcmtronaije, whirh. ace?rding to nvxlrrn umjre, is heM to in; a- much a perquisite of the position of M. C- a* the frankling privilege, or the stationery allotment. Klectioneering ilebts doe the "workers" Ewl'o nominate and elect members are to be paid in tliH? way. But there are u-ually ho many more office-seekers than office.-., and all are so clamorAt.a *k?* . ? * * " * *-uf luai a K?IUU iu.'iuv members D4^m 10 think that paying off oM dt-hto iu this way costs inori than it comes to. The ?fflce-soeker is the plague of the Congressman'* life. 'logging him at every ?tep, and at , all boars, waking or *lee|>?ag. at his home or at the Capitol. (ongressmen of capacity for busiTie>v feci that they can use their time to better advantage than in reading the greasy papers and listening to the lon^-wind?'d appeals of the o?i re-seeking bores; and this feeling will go far to cause them to give up the slight personal advantage to be obtained from the control of local appointments. The tact that every ofllce-secking constituent is made a bitter enemy if disappointed. and that many more are disappointed k than successful, furnishes another item on the lose side of the account. It is well for Congressmen, our city fathers, and property owners on Pennsylvania avenue that the poor horses cannot make speeches or cast votes. If they could, we fancy that magnificent thoroughfare would not be left much loiter in it* uriMnt ^ . M ?vv>ut an i uaugrruus condition. What might easily be made the finot drive and promenade in the world, is now really one of the least attractive, and all for want of being decently pared. And not only that; it is uncomfortable for those person* . obliged to use it, unsafe lor tlu>ir hones, and terribly destructive of their vehicles. Bat a change in these respects in not all that would be gained by the much needed improvement. Every piece of property fronting on the ATenue would at once be increased in Talue ten times its por;->rtion of the cost of properly paving the w hole roadway. Is it not possible, therefore. to get something done in this direction, and that without further delay! If Congress refuses to pmj the j>ortion of the cost which thonld rightfully be borne by tin general government, let our municipal authorities, the street railway company, ami the property hold vi- vumjii me ncrrauj permission, and do tlie work at their own e*|?ense. It would be one of the U?t investment* they ever made. Not only would it be returned to them directly in more valuable property, but one of the chief glories of Washington would be brought before strangers in such a manner that this act would of itselt'do n.ore than any single one Of which we can cow think toward dispelling the whole ide:? of removing the capital. A barbed arrow seems to be aimed at par?ons | Bffti.er and Frothingham in that part of He- ! ctfder liackttCs chtige to the grand jury, on I WcdirsliT last, which a<ljures that body to in- ] diet any persons implicated, no matter how ele- j Tat. d in life they may be, if it believes that big- j amy was committed, or w? aided and abetted, in the recent K i c har (1m >n-Mc Far la rid marriage i ceremony.

The expression of popi lar opinion La- been so general in its extent ai.d so unmistakable in it* tone, that no one, though a t?ol. can err a." to its meai.ing.

Here w?.? a well paid, well trained, and I thoroughly sifted body of officers. who could do the work well. Mr. Mavaard nrrucd that it wj* not to be expected that, with the late of compensation pro' vided for enumerators, (fH a day for sixty days.) ? < r>ii >t t, nt men could be procured, or th:?t anything like a complete ceiuius would Ih> taken bv them. l-i Mime res|iects he thought well of the I pro|Kwition of the gentleman from Maxsachuj sett*. (Mr. Butler.) Mr. Stokes, chairman of the Census Commit tee, replied to Mr. Maynard's objection, and expressed his conviction that competent men could be got for *4 a day. which was all that the me?kr? of the Tennessee Legislature reI ceived. Mr. Judd argued on the great importance ot" I the statistical information to be obtained by the I W taker, not only for the legislative department of the country," but for the national ered- i itor* abroad; and expressed his sentiment that im) ideas of economy should be permitted to intervene as an obstacle to a perfect and compute census. Mr. Garfield also replied to the argument in l'avor of employing the internal revenue officers to take the census; taking the ground that the ta\-gather?.-r was an officer Oil ions to tlie people, who should be thoroughly convinced that the census had do connection whatever with taxai tion. Mr. Allison, a member of the Orwn* Cnmmit- . tee, ?L-<> argued against the amendment offered bv Mr. Butler. That proposition had been fully and carefully considered by the committee, and had been rejected. Mr. Butler paid hi.- plan did not propose to interfere with the duties of the Commissioner of Internal Re venue, but to place the awes-wrs Tor this puri<o*e under the Census Sii]>crintendeiit. -Mr. Allison remarked that then the pro|tosition was *tdl more objectionable, because it would place assessor* and nMiatant as*ts.sors under two separate and distinct jurisdiction*, which would make ' confusion worse con- . founded.*' Mr. Wood thought that the amendment offer- ! ed b> Mr. Buth r wm-> not without merit, aud said that his first impulse had been to favor anything which would restrict the patronage of the j Ai'miuvtratluu; but, considering the vast interests at stake. ai d knowing that the wrholi- value 1 of the census dejH nded upon its precision and accuracy, lie would not allow any lee line of :? 1 partisan character to Interfere with it. Referring to the New York ccnsu* of he stigmatized it a.- a shameful {-artisan fraud ui>->11 the people, w hich had cut down the |>opulsttion oi the citv by for the puri>ose or not allowing it proper representation in the State LegL? , latine. Mr. lenckes argued that there was something ot \alue In each oi' the |>eiiding propositions, ami that, while the assessor* .should not l>e employed to take the enumeration, the statistical infotniatioii ]>o^?efiMert by the Internal Iteveuue Bureau should be utilized for the puri?*>c of the census. Mr. Butler (Macs.) closed the debate by an argument in sup|*>rt of his amendment. He I claimed that under it there would be greater , etticiency. greater promptitude, greater accu racy, and greater economy. The. mntUmau 1 iMm New York (Mr. Woo'll had informed the ' committee tliit the c< amis of ItfciS in liw State. I made by the Republican party, had been en- j tirelr a fraud. The corollary of that would K't m to be that there should be 110 cen.-ua taken at all. There mi^lit be au idiogyueracy al-otit Sew York that nothiug could be done there which was not a fraud iu someway or form; but lie trusted that lv\. here there eonl.l tw an honest census taken. He admitted! that there was great danger that nothing could be found out in New York axi.it the election-, about the een.HU?, about gold speculations, or about scheme* of every soit. It seemed to be one living mass ot' corruption and fraud, of which the gentleman (Mr. Wood) was a represcntatire. [Laughter.} Mr. Davis ?sk> d Mr. Butler whether he meant the State or the city. Mr. Butler ?The city always, sir. Mr. I?avi*?Then I have nothing to say. Mr. Butler.?I thought not. [Laughter.] Mr. Wood.?I a?k the gentleman whether his opinion of New York ha-been gathered trom the amount of litigation to which he has been subjected to there. [Langhtw.] Mr. Butler?Not at ail, sir. 1 have never yet been able to get a case for trial in New York. I exrcct a rood deal of fraud when 1 do.
