Hopes to Solve Problem With New Treaty Supreme Court ' to Determine Status of State ARIZONA FLOODS SPREAD GREAT DISASTER Little Is Left of Town of Clifton as a Result of Bursting of Reservoir EIGHTEEN LIVES ARE REPORTED LOST Gila River Is Doing Much Damage and Globe Is in State of Isolation SOLOMONVILLE, A. TJL Dec. s.— As the result of thirty hours' 'steady rain over Southern Arizona, the mining town of Clifton, with 3000 population, ha? been swept by a terrific flood and hundreds of people have fled to the mountains for safety. Owing to dis abled wires details are hard to obtain, but the known death list reaches eighteen and will doubtless be much larger. The greater portion of the population are the Mexicans and Italians, who live in squalid huts, now inundated. The town is built in three factions. Chase Creek and North and South Clifton. The catastrophe commenced with the breaking of a big reservoir in the mountains ai>ove. precipitating a vast flood upon the Chase Creek section. The principal street is near the bed of the stream and was completely de stroyed. It was there that the fatali ties occurred, as the flood came in a head eeven feet high and engulfed the people without warning. The dead are mostly foreigners, whose names cannot be learned. Two Americans are known to have perished, one being caught in a pile of wreckage and • -' - • \u25a0 . . s , •\u25a0 . -f drowned. HOUSES WASHED AWAY North and South Clifton are swept by the San Francisco River. A new prhool building and scores of houses wrre washed away. The railway bridge is tottering. All information is sent out from a telephone ofSce surrounded by water. The great smelting works of the Arizona Copper Works are located at Clifton and the company's loss will be heavy. The Arizona and New Mexico Railway Company will also be a heavy loser, as its yards and shops are inundated. The river is receding rapidly, the weather has cleared and no further damage is apprehended. Two bodies were recovered from the wreckage along Chase Creek. Joe Throm, who was rescued from the flood and whose wife was lost, was taken to the hospital in a critical condition from bruises received, but probably will recover. Three Mexicans caught in the act of looting refused to surrender to officers and were shot and fatally wounded. Only one business house on Chase Creek escaped damage and many were entirely destroyed. The Becker-Franz Mercantile Company in North Clifton in that section was damaged to the extent of $10,000. The Coronado rail road suffered damage all the way from Clifton to Metcalf, and It will be sev eral weeks before trains can pass over its lines. PEOPLE ARE ROOFLESS So many restaurants and hotels have been destroyed that It Is almost im possible to find a place to sleep or eat In the towns, but there will be no shortage of provisions, as many stores have escaped the floods. The railroad bridges are so badly damaged that it will be impossible to use them for some time. The Herald building was swept away and the Era has been put out of business for a couple of weeks. The Era building was flooded to a depth of six feet and the plant was greatly damaged. The Gila River Is carrying a tremen dous flood and is doing great damage to farming lands. The railway bridge at San Carlos is destroyed and the town of Globe is thereby cut off from all travel and mail facilities.

RICE FIVE CENTS. "State Matter" Says Pardee SACRAMENTO. Dec. 5. — Gov ernor George C. Pardee tonlsht Kave the follow ing view* on the subject of Japanese and the San' Fran cisco nehools its treated In the message of President Roose velt: "I don't think the President nor the people of the East un derstand the qnestion. They do not understand as ire do, that It would not do to have adult Japanese, or adult Chinese, or adult «Trhltes for that matter, attend school with little chil dren. The rule applies to all. No elderly children should be sent to the same classes vrtth yonnp children. We understand that perfectly here, bnt the President and the Eastern peo ple do not appear to understand It. I do not see how the treaty -frith Japan has anything, to do with It. It Is entirely a State matter/* the stand that the Japanese are belss discriminated against. Professor T. Hengstler. lecturer on constitutional and international law at the University of California, argues, on the other hand, that California has a right to make whatever laws regulat ing her control of schools that she sees fit, and that while Roosevelt's recom mendations may be big, humanitarian and good politics, they cannot be legal ly enforced. .The Japanese of San Francisco quit* naturally hail the message of the Prest dent as the manifesto of a statesman commanding universal admiration. They say that the naturalization of Japanese would be a guarantee of permanent peace between the peoples of the United States and Asia. Local Sentiment Must Yield, Thinks Tokio. 

TOKIO. Dec. 5. — The clear, firm, de- ; termlned attitude of President Roose velt in his message In reference to the San Francisco school question and anti- Japanese sentiment Is warmly praised. It Is felt here that however much the San Francisco school authorities may be affected by local sentiment, they must ultimately yield to the moral weight which President Roosevelt's message carries. The Kokumin Shimbun says edi torially that the San Francisco school question presents a complicated aspect with reference to the fundamental principles of the Federal Government and unequivocally reveals one of the weak polnw of the American political organization. The editor believes that a prompt settlement of the unfortu nate affair would have been better for all "concerned, but he does, not think the outcome is altogether hopeless, as the energetic President Roosevelt prob ably will not fall to adjust the matter. British Acquiesce in President's Opinions - 

LONDON. Dec. 5. — -President Rooae velt's declaration, in his message to Congress yesterday on the treatment' accorded Japanese In the San Francis co schools especially appeals to "-, thi British at the. present time, because In both South Africa and South Austra lia there exists a similar anti-Asiatic feeling, which has created embarrass ment for the Imperial authorities. During the present week the homo Government vetoed a Transvaal or dinance further restricting the privi leges of British Indians, even those long resident In the country, while quite recently. the Government refused to accept an Australian proffer of a preferential tariff "provided the goods were shipped in vessels not employing yellow seamen." .The newspapers here point out that the Western States of America have no monopoly of the anti-Aslaticism. saying that the President's remarks "convey a lesson which might well be laid to heart in other quarters than that to which it Is directly addressed/"
