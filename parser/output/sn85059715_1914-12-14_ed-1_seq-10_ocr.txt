Lovejoy, general secretary of the National Child Lar bor Committee, in dlscusking proposed changes In the West Virginia child labor law in their. relation to the Palmer-Owen bill now pending in I Congress. There are many additions P to the West Virginia child labor law ? to be urged,at the coming session of 1 the legislature and among the most j important are the prohibition of night * work by children under 16, the pro- ? hlbltion of the employment of chil- 8 dren under 16 in mines or quarries, and the provision for an 8-hopr day j: for children under 16, all of which jj are embodied In the Palmer-Owen r federal child labor bill. This proposed federal bill to reg- j, ulate Interstate comnftrce in the nro- . ducts of child labor has already been favorably reported by the House com-| r miltee on labor and lias the support , of congressmen of all parties and of ? many national organizations such as c tbe American Federation of Labor, B the Federal Council of Churches of 0 Christ in America and the American v Medical Association besides the Na- tlonal Child Labor Committee who drafted the bill. It is said to reprie- I sent the minimum provisions of a I good child labor law and besides the f provisions named above prohibit In terstate commerce in goods in the production of which children under C 14 have been employed in factories, mills, canneries and workships. There are nine states that have all the provisions of this bill already on their, statute books and only two states ol that have none of its provisions. C If West Virginia does not pass the c< proposed additions to her law and be- w comes as Mr. Lovejoy put it, one of w the states thht have to be coerced by e: (Tin forlorn 1 n>rtwn??tvi??* * ' ?

Even men who drink and love it voted to make West Virginia dry because they wanted the temptation removed." MIbb Henderson describes some of the conditions which the miners and mountaineers faced In the 'recent strike. "When the mines-opened the mountaineers left their homes and got jobs in the camps," she says. "Some of them had been working only two months when the strike came and thev ware turned nut nf tholr homes. They couldn't go back to the mountains, because they didn't have anything to eat, so they lived through the winter in tents. "It's,a bitter things for some of these mountaineers to see corporations making millions out of the Umber land which their fathers and grandfathers owned and sold for a mere. song. Most of the mountaineers now are living on company Iitnd. We can't blame them if they are a little belligerent." YOUHyUEN In .the South Are Exposed to Accident and Disease Declares Investigator. NEW YORK, Dec. 14.?Exposure to accident and a definite tendency to tuberculosis, are the penalUes that young children pay for working in the cotton mills, according to Lewis W. Hlne, staff pho/>grapher of .the National Child' Labor Committee, who baB just'returned from several weeks of InvestlgaUon In the South. "I am shocked to And conditions still so bad in North Carolina. The legal age limit there for factories is 18 years, but from my study of twenty| mills in North Carolina alone, I believe .that there are hundreds of violations, and that the 1910 census figures which reported 4,000 children I under 14 in the cotton mills of that I one state and 100,000 children under I 14 In non-agricultural work throughout the country, are a conservative estimate of the number of young children at work today. There arc still twenty other states besides North Carolina in which the employment of children under 14 in mills or canneries is legal, so that the physical danger and the lack ot education from premature work continue unchecked." With these facts in mind the National Child -Labor Committee is calling a conference of all Intereied in the projection of children", at Washington on < January 5 and 6. to emphasize the need of a federal child labor law. The speakers will include Representative A. Mitchell! Palmer cf Pennsylvania, who introduced last January the child labor, bill which is on the 'Wlendar for the present session; Senator Robert L.
