THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Both Houses of Congress reassem bled at Washington last Monday at noon. But little business has been done, so far, the principal object of at tention being the President's message. Thai document is quite long and not particularly lively,but goes very thor oughly over the national situation, taking up the matters that pertain to etch department in detail. Mr. Cleve land makes no allusion to the recent election, but recommends that Con gress pass the so called “pop gun” bills for free coal, iron ore and sugar. He makes some good suggestions in re gard to increasing our commerce and endorses Mr. Carlisle's currency pol icy, which is practically the system re cently adopted by the National Bank ers’ Association, known as the Bal timore plan. The plan seems to offer a good many advantages,but the aver age country editor is just at. this time too busily engaged in solving the fi nancial problem of raising the neces sary currency to meet his January bills to make a careful analysis of it. With this end in view it occurs to us that the business of the country is suffering more from stagnation than anything else. There is plenty of money but something is needed to put it into circulation. The JEgis devil suggests that times would soon be come good if every one would pay their debts. Perhaps he has not struck far from the key to the situa tion. If the government were to in crease the circulating medium to three times its present amount the money would all be locked up until a revival of business or a general squaring of ac counts should call for its circulation. Incredible as it may seem to those who can not find the ready cash for which their exchequers yawn so ar dently, there are millions upon mil lions of dollars in the United States that are rusting in the vaults because the current of trade has not force enough lo float them. Right here in Harford coulfty there are many thous ands of dollars seeking safe and pro fitable investment. Just as soon as the conditions which are no w depress ing agriculture are removed the gold en stream will begin to flow from out the coffers of its present holders, and everything will be brisk, for when the farmer prospers all prosper. The main question then is to help the con dition of the husbandman. A Demo cratic Congress has already passed a tariff bill which, as soon as its provi visions have time to take effect, must be a great relief by lightening many of the farmer's heaviest burdens. The Republican Congress which will come into power on March 4 next will be powerless to repeal it for at least two years, and we may therefore look witli a reasonable degree of certainty for better times in the near future wheth er any change is made in our financial system or not. LET VS 

HAVE GOOD MEN. At the meeting of the Democratic Executive Committee, in Bel Air, on Monday, there was a large attendance not only of anxious eandidates-eleet (not elect candidates) but other De mocrats interested in the result of the meeting, and there was a full and free discussion of the proposed change in the method of making nominations. In deference to the wishes of a num ber of Democrats, who while they ex pressed a desire for a change thought the question should be settled by the Democratic voters at the next primary election, the Committee concluded to afford the party at large another op portunity to pass upon the subject.— The Democratic nominations in 1885 will accordingly be made as hereto fore, but with an important modifica tion requiring would-be candidates to show that at least seventy-five Demo crats in their respective districts de sire their names to be placed on the ticket. This action of the Committee will commend itself to all except a few blatant demagogues who desire to be come candidates but cannot secure the requisite endorsement, and this, doubtless, was the object the com mittee had in view. If a man cannot command in his own neighborhood the small number of endorsers re quired it is evident that there is no urgent reason for his name being on the ticket save his own desire to have the office. This rule will likewise in ure to the benefit of bona fide can didates, by preventing a multiplicity of candidates for the same office, brought out as decoy ducks merely to defeat the nomination of some parti cular man who in all probability would be the strongest at the general election. It is to be hoped that this new rule will have the desired effect of giving us candidates who are men of ability, integrity and morality—not chronic office-seekers whose fitness for the po sition sought exists only in their sel fish desire to have it. The ASgis exhorts all Democrats who are loyal to their party and true to their principles to see to it that the party candidates be our best men, not such as are notoriously unfit for office or who gain nomination by dis honorable methods. Party leaders and party voters ought to realize that unless they nominate good men their ticket will be defeated. —lt is rather amusing to read the different “booms” which have been published by the Republican organs of this State, trotting out their can didates for Governor. They apparent ly take things as seriously as if they really thought their party had some show next tall. The Democratic par ty will elect the next Governor of Maryland and has plenty of good men. We can find a dozen or two if necessary right here in Harford coun ty. One of the best, a clean, straight forward Democrat,is George M. Jewett Esq., of Glenville. Mr. Jewett has not been actively identified with poli tics in this county in the sense of seek ing office, but in the eyes of many this would be no discredit to him. He was at different times, however, prom inently mentioned as a candidate for Governor and for Congress during his residence in Ohio. He would give the State a sound business administration and could be elected hands down. -—We announce with pain and re gret t he death of Colonel John < larroll Walsh, which took place suddenly, last Saturday morning, at his home, “The Mound,” near Jerusalem Mills. CoutteoUP in manner, considerate of others, charitable to the poor, always a Democrat, not from selfish motives but because he believed in the truth of Democratic principles, just in all things—his death is a loss to the coun ty and State. At the beginningof the war he was one of the editors of The Aigis and ever since manifested an interest in its welfare. —Governor elect William C. Oates, of Georgia, was inaugurated last Sat urday with the usual ceremonies.— Captain Kolb,the Populist candidate, was also sworn in before a magistrate and afterward made a speech to about 200 people. it is understood that Kolb is going through this programme in order that he may certify the elec tion of a Populist or Republican Uni ted States Senator so as to give color to a contest. —Ex-Governor Oden Bowie died at his residence, “Fairview,” Prince George’s county, early Tuesday morn ing from the effects of a stroke of pa ralysis with which he was stricken on Tuesday, November 27. He was buried on Thursday in the family burying-ground at Fairview. Thu Review of Keviewn. “The Progress of the World,” the editorial department of the Review of Reviews for De cember, sums up the significant results of the November elections, discusses the probable action of Congress on the “Baltimore plan” of bank note issues, comments on the progress of the civil service reform movement, and again emphasizes the extent of England’s en croachments in Venezuela ; the department also chronicles important movements in European politics, and the history of the war i n China is brought down to date. Washington Letter. From Our Regular Correspondent. Washington, December 3.—No message ever written by President Cleveland was more attentively listened to than that sent in to-day. The general topics treated by the message, in cluding the foreign relations of the govern ment, were all that any Democrat could desire, and the financial recommendations cannot be fully understood until considered in connection with Secretary Carlisle’s annual report, to be sent to Congress to-morrow, which contains the details of the plan for a reform of the cur rency of the country which the President so strongly endorses in nis message. What will be the result of these financial recommenda tions it will bo impossible to say until the senti ment of the Democrats has had time to become apparent. Speaker Crisp looked quite as good natured when he rapped the House to order as he could possibl y have looked had a majority of the House been as fortunate as himself in getting re-rlectcd, and his own re-election to the Speak ership been assured. Indeed, the most notice able feature on the Democratic side of the House, aside from the entirely too numerous empty chairs, was the prevailing good nature of thos<* who were defeated last month. If the Republicans expected to see an array of long faces they were disappointed. There have been a number of informal con ferences of Democratic Senators and Repren tatives for the purpose of discussing the prob ability of reaching an agreement on a pro gramme for the session, ana there is some talk of holding a joint caucus and requiring every man who attends to pledge himself to stand by whatever programme the caucus adopts. If pledges could be secured from a sufficient number to control both House and Senate that would be an excellent idea, but it is certain that there are six or more Democratic Senators who would not pledge themselves. Like numerous other fake stories, that as serting that President Cleveland was offended with Admiral Walker because of the report he made on affairs in Hawaii, has been disproved in a striking manner by the official order plac ing Admiral Walker at the head of the Light House Board, a position that is considered by naval officers oue of the most desirable under the government. The President seems to have a sjieciul liking for this method of knocking out silly stories- It is much better and far more convincing than a stereotyped denial. Treasury ofiicials take no stool; in the stories that Congress will refuse to appropriate the money needed to put the income tux into oper ation, for the very simple reason that there are no more opponents of that tax in either Senate or House than there were when it was incor porated in the tariff bill. That is the common sense view of the matter. If the opponents of the tax could not prevent its being included in the tariff bill they certainly cannot prevent an appropriation to put it into effect. There is reason, too, for the belief that Senator Hill, who led the fight against the income tax in the Senate, will not only refuse to aid in trying to defeat the appropriation, but will himself vote for it, as he is on record as opposing any and all attempts to embarrass officials by withholding appropriations asked for, to be used in carry ing out existing laws. Representative Cooper, of Florida, thinks the proper way to fill the office of postmaster is to have him elected by the voters of his town or township, and he proposes to push a bill pro viding therefor. Ho is also strongly m favor of the adoption of some system of currency re form that will give the needed elasticity to our currency, either that proposed by Secretary Carlisle or soraethiug else upon w’ ich a major ity can get together, and of a bi' providing for the building of the Nicaragua canal. He says that if he could have his own way he would make this session of Congress, short as it will be, memorable in the history of the Democratic party. It’s a pity there are not more Demo crats of the same mind. Although nothing can be officially stated, because no official action has yet been taken, there is little room for doubt that the subcom mittee which went to Cleveland, Ohio, to inves tigate charges made against J udge Ricks, of having appropriated fees properly belonging to the government to his own use, will in its ro- Kirt to the full Judiciary Committee of the ouse take the ground that the charge was proven, in fact, virtually admitted by Judge Kicks himself. It is thought that the question of whether impeachment proceedings shall be instituted will be left for the full committee to decide. The committee will make its report to the House before the holidays.unless something not now expected shall occur to prevent, and it is expected to favor impeachment. The sugar scandal has raised its ugly head again, and the same Democratic Senators whose names were most conspicuously smirch ed during the preparation of the sugar schedule of the tariff bill are again figuring in the rumors in a manner that is decidedly unpleasant to Democrats generally, however the trio of Sen ators may look at the matter. Many Demo crats are in favor of settling this business for good and all by just putting all sugar on the free list. C. A. S. Baltimore Pianos in Norway. Baltimore American. An important business connection has just been made by William Kuabe & Co. with the well-known Christiania house of J. W. Cap- Selen, which is the leading music bouse of orway. Mr. Cappeleu has been given the sole agency for the sale of the Kuabe pianos for Norway, and will handle them henceforth regularly us its principal instrument. This arrangement is specially gratifying to the Kuhlkj Company, as it was brought about sole ly through the reputatiou for excellence which their pianos have attained in Europe as well as in this country, and which induced the great Christiania house to apply for and se cure the agency. An assortment of upright and grand pianos ordered by the Cappeleu firm was shipped from the factory yesterday. Deeds Recorded During November. M. Marion Malcolm and wife to Charles St ockham.

Number, 1894, and continue to November, 1895. Whoever y may be one’s favorite among English novelists, it will be conceded by all critics that Thomas Hardy stands foremost as a master artist in tiction, and The Simpletons may be expected to arouse enthusiasm not inferior in degree to , that which has marked Trilby—the most suc cessful story of the year. Another leading feature will be the Personal Hecollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte, Her Page and Secretary, under whijh guise the most popular of living American magazine writers will present the story of the • aid of Orleans. In tin* January Number will appear a profusely illustrated paper on Charleston and the Carolinas, the first of a series of South ern Papers.

Harper’s Weekly IN 1805. //arjMr'ti Weekly is a pictorial history of the , times. It presents every im|ortaiit event promptly, accurately, and exhaustively in il lustration and descriptive text of the highest order. The manner in which, during 1894, it has treated the Chicago Railway Strikes and the Chino-Japanese War, and the amount of light it was able to throw on Korea the instant at tention was directedito that little-known coun try, are examples of its almost boundless re sources. Julian Ralph, the distinguished wri ter and correspondent, has been sent to the feat of war, and there joined by C. D. Weldon, the well-known American artist, now for many years resident in Japan, who has been engaged to co-operate with Mr. Ralph in sending to Harper * Weekly exclusive information and il lustration. During 1*95 every vital question will be dis cussed with vigor and without prejudice in the editorial columns, and also in special articles by the highest authorities in each department. Portraits of the men and women who are mak ing history, and powerful and caustic political cartoons, will continue to be characteristic features. This Busy World, with its keen and kindly comment on the lesser doings of the day, will remain a regular department. Fiction.—There will be two powerful serials, both handsomely illustrated— The Red Cock ade, a stirring romance of olden days by Stan ley J. Weyman, and a novel of New York, en titled The Son of His Father, by Brander Mat thews-several novelettes and many short stories by popular writers.
