ALMOST MAGIC CURE BY CUTICURA REMEDIES Our son, two years old, was very much afflicted with a breaking outer what looked to bo a summer rash. I applied the usual remedies, such as washing with soda water and powdering with bone acid. Finally, after he suf fered with tlie trouble several weeks I took him to the doctor. He said it was merely a rash that was quite prevalent, and that I was giving the right treat ment and that f should just continue it and the baby would soon be all right. But instead of getting better it was get ting worse. The rash ran together and made large blisters. The little fellow didn't want to do anything but scratch and we had to wrap his hands up to keep him from it as he would tear the flesh open till the blood would run. The itching was intense, causing loss of appe tite and flesh. When it seemed to hurt him most the skin on his back became hard and rough like the bark of a tree so that rubbing or brushing would not break it. He was so feverish that I thought it a bad case of eczema. He could not wear any clothes but a little nightgown with the sleeves just fastened at the top of the shoulder. He suffered intensely for about three months. But I found a remedy in Cuticura Soap for bathing and Cuticura Ointment with which I anointed the sore places. This kept the rash from spreading and in less than a week the result was almost magi cal. That was more than two years ago and there has not been the "slightest symptom of it since he was cured. lam never very long without Cuticura Soap as my family knows the value of it and don't like a substitute.

KANSAS CITY IN TROUBLE (Continued From Page One) rounding- suburbs there were about a hundred drinking places no different from those to be found in any "wet" | community. From these "joints" was | derived a large part of the revenue of j the city. For a time the mayor, and po lice department, backed by the entire city government and the popular sen timent of a majority of the people, de fied the state authorities. Some two years ago ouster suits brought against the mayor and other Pittsburg officials by the state in the supreme court and a judgment m ouster w-as rendered and permanent injunctions granted restraining the of j flcials from collecting fines from the ! jointists and giving police protection ;in return. later word reached Attor j ney Jackson that the injunction was j being violated. Investigation showed that Frank Linski, acting as a go-be tween for the city officials and the jointists was collecting money from MAX FIGMAN In Scene From the New York—Chicago Comedy Success, 'MAR/ JANE'S PA" At the Keylor Gra rcl khcattd 18. the jointists and cashing city war rants for policemen and firemen. They were arrested and 21 convictions ot officials and jointists for contempt of court were secured. Since then the crusade has contin ued without intermission. Many joint ists have been sent to jail. Liquor Is still being sold here, but it is of the vilest possible quality, and unpreju diced persons declare that this fact is largely responsible for the crime wave which has swept over the section. Pittsburg is an industrial and mining city, with a large foreign population, largely addicted to drink. Those who formerly drank beer in the open sa loons are now driven to indulgences in cheap "forty-rod" whiskey. Another arraignment against the prohibition-enforcers is that the city, shut off from a large revenue provided by the joints, is unable to employ suf ficient police and firemen, leaving the town at the mercy of criminals and a possible conflagration. Not long ago robbers broke into a house only five blocks from the busi ness section, snatched the diamond ear rings from the ears of a sleeping girl and then forced her to drink carbolic acid, causing her death. Only a short time before a woman was assaulted and murdered, and her husband and child slain. Other crimes have oc curred frequently, and the people are terrorized. FATHER LEAVES (Continued From Page Six) that he had just arrived and was not able to get any money at the banks as it was too late, borrowed the sum of $5. First indications that these places of business had regarding the dishon esty of the man were gleaned when the time for the .*-st payment was near. These he totally disregarded and it was when assured that he did not moan to pay for them, that the goods were taken back. Both the wagon and phonograph were reclaimed yesterday and when the agents for these com panies arrived at Heifer's home/they discovered that he had left. It was tnen ascertained that, he had left his family absolutely destitute, even taking the small hoard of pennies that the children had saved up. In all he is supposed to have made away with about $90 and this small sum was all that stood between the family and actual want. Neighbors of these people are tak ing care of the destitute family. ROASTED BY BOTH PARTIES (Continued From One) portant point." Bryan declared it is pain that the coming special messages will not sug gest anything, not acceptable to the "special interests."' "The president says the Sherman anti-trust law needs amendment," says Bryan. "He is mistaken, it needs en forcement." LaFollette Talks. MADISON, Wis., Dec. 17.— If Pres ident Taft expects to put forward the Roosevelt policies he will do well to go about it prompt'y and not leave con- I gress and the people to infer, as well they may after the expedience of the last extra session, that he is waiting for the appearance of the Aldrich and Cannon program." Thus Senator LaFollette closes hi~ editorial in his weekly magazine to day, sharply criticising President Taft and his recent message to congress. LaFollette sarcastically indicates that it is his belief that the president is drawing away from the po'icies of his predecessor. He calls attention to the brevity of the message to the spe cial session saying, "Every where thoughtful men were anticipating a great state paper." Regarding the last message to comefro m. the White House, LaFollette comments that he was "silent where he should have spoken more strongly." The senator , declares the people are anxious to see the definite official form of Taft's wishes regarding legislation. "The tariff was a bad job," he con tinues, "and the Ballinger situation grows more tense as the truth is known." Husband Now i I | Is Locked Up i Charged with living off the earn ings of his wife. Thomas May, who was the cause of her arrest several days ago, was himself placed under lock and key last night upon informa tion furnished Prose, uting Attorney Everett J. Smith. It is said that Mrs. May, who was accused of living In malicious cohabitation with Gus Arndt had converted her house. 513 West Birch street into one of ill re pute and the proceeds derived from tnis nefarious business were used by i the husband. Arndt, who was arrested last Sat urday night upon the complaint of I May, later made what he termed a full ! confession to the sheriff and this in volved May to such an extent that he was also apprehended. The. particu : lars of this confession are the most 1 revolting that have ever come to light in this country and the exact circum : stances are too horrible to make pub he. j As a result much more serious j charges may be lodged against the I father and mother a3 well as Arndt. ! Startling developments are looked for !at the tria , but If much of the cvi ! dence is brought out the trial will j doubtless be held behind closed doors, i The series of crimes said to have j been perpretrated in the May home j are unparale'led in the history of this I county. Arndt, it is said, is going on j the stand at the trial, next Febru i ary and will make a ' clean breast." of I what he knows. Both Mr. and Mrs. j May deny the truth of Arndt's con ! fession. When Deputy McAl'ister went to i the May home yesterday, the three i.children, one aged 5. the second aged j7, and the other aged 11, were at 1 home. He had a neighbor stay with j the children last night and they will probably be cared for in some way to day. Startling facts in connction with the alleged debauching of the chil dren at the instance of the parents, it is likely, will be brought out at the trial.
