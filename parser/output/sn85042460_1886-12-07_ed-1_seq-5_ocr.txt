The President's Message. [(Viuli-itierf from Ftmt Pa<jr.\ torncys nnd marshals, and the lalterstibject is commended to the Congress lor Us actlou lv the inlerestof economy, tue Government and humanity, fairness aud justice to our people. THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE IN- Presouts a comprehensive summary of the work of the various branches of the public service connected with his department, and the suggestions aud recommendations which It contains, for the Imrrovemeut for the service, should receive your careful at tention. Tne exhibit made of the condi tion of our ludiuu population, and the pro gressof the work for their enlightenment, notwithstanding those embarrassments which hiuder the bolter administration Ol this Important branch of tho service, Is a gratlfjiug aud hopeful one. The funds ap propriated for the Indian service for the ns cal year just passed, Willi the available in come from iudiau lands and trust money, amounting in all to *7,"M,77..12. were ample for the scrvlc \ under the conditions and re strictions of laws regul itlug their expendi tures. There remained a liilance 0.. baud Juue 20, 1880. of »T,5011,023,110,0f which tl,.Ui. --7i«.21 are permanent funds ior a fulfillment of treaties aud other like purposes, and the remainder »323,2.W.09 subject to be carried to the Surplus Fuud as required by law. THE 

ESTIMATES PRESENTED For appropriation for the ensuing fiscal year amount to tu,G08,873 64, or *442,350 20 less than those laid before tho Congress last year. The present system of agencies, while absolutely necessary and well adapt ed lor the management of our ludiuu air Irs aud fortheeuds in view when it wa&adopted, is iv the present stage of Indian manage meut Inadequate of standing alone for the accomplishment for au object which has be come pressing iv its impair. tuce by the more rapid transition from tribal orgadtxationi to citizenship of such portions of the In dians as areinoapable of civilized life.When tbe existing system was adopted the lu diau race was outside the limits of organ ised States and Terrritories and beyond tne Immediate reach and opera'ion of civiliza tion and all efforts were mainly directed to the maiutenancc oi friendly relations ami the preservation of pence and quiet of the frontier, aud all of this is now changed. There is uo such thing as the Indian fron tier. Civilization, with the busy hum 01 industry and the lulluenco of Christianity, surrounds this people at every point, None of the tribes are outside oi the bounds of organ-zed government aud society, except that the territorial system has not been ex tended over that portion of the country known as tne Indian territory. As a race the Indians are uo longer hostile, but may be considered as submissive to the control of the Government, as lew of them are troublesome. Kxeptthe Iragmeut of sev eral bauds are ull now gathered upou reservatii us. It is no longer possible for them to snbslst by the chase and spontaneous produciious oi nature, with an abuudauce of laud, if furnished with the means aud implements for profit able husbandry. Their life of entire de pendence upou government rations from day lo day is uo longer defensible. Their inclination long iosicred by a defective system of control l» to cling to habits aud customs of their ancestors and struggle with persistence against the change of life which their altered circumstances impress upon them but barbarism and civilization cannot live together; it is impossible 

THAT SUCH INCONGRUOUS CONDITIONS ajjhould co-exist on the same soil. They are a portion of our people, are under the au thority ol* our government and have a pecu liar claim upon and are entitled to the fostering care aud protection of the uatiou. The government cannct relieve itself of this responsibility until they are so far trained and civilized as to be able wholly to man age and care for themselves. The path iv which they should walk must be clearly mirked out for them and they inn t be led or guided uulit they are familiar with the way and competent to assume the duties and responsibilities of our citizens. Progress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace aud at great expense unless tbe system aud methods of management are improved to meet the changed conditions and urgent demands of the service. The agents having general charge and supervision in many cases of more than five thousand Indians scattered over large reservations and bur dened with the details of accountability for funds and supplies, have time to look after the Industrial training and improvement of a few Indians only aud the many are neg lected aud remain idle aud dependeut, con ditions not favorable for progress in civili zation THE 

COMPENSATION ALLOW ED THESE AGENTS And the conditions of the service are no calculated to secure for the workmen who are fitted by ability and skill to properly _-:>!;iii aud intelligently direct the methods best adopted to produce tbe most speedy re aults aud permanent benefits, lieuce ihe necessity lor a supplemental agency or sys tem directed to the end of promoting the feueral aud more rapid transition of tribes rom habits aud customs oi barb rity to the ways of civilization with au anxious desire to devise some plan of opertlou by which to secure the welfare of the ludians aud to relieve the treasury so far as possi ble froji the support of au Idle and depend ent population. 1 recommended iv my pre vious auuual message the passage of a law authorizing the appointment of a commis sion as an instrumental auxillUry to those already established lor the care of the iu diaus. It was designed that this committee or commission should be composed of six intelligent aud capable persons, three to be detailed from the army, having practical ideas upou the subject of treatmeut of In dians aud interested in their wel tare, and that it should be lv charge and under the direction of the Secretary o( the Interior, with the management of such matters oi details which cannot with the present or ganization be properly and successfully conducted, and wnich present different piutses, as the Indians themselves diller in their progress, disposition aud capacity for improvement or immediate self-support. By the aid ol such commission much un wise aud useless expenditure of money, waste of materials aud unavailing efforts might be avoided, and it is hoped that this or Some measure which the wisdom of Con gress may better devise to supply the defi ciency of the present system, may receive your consideration aud the appropriate leg islation be provided. The time Is ripe for the work of such an agency. Them is less oppositlouto the education and training of the Indian youth, as shown bythelncreasod attendance upon the schools, and there is a yielding tendency for the individual hold ing of land. Development and advance ment in these directions are essential aud should b«e every encouragement. As tbe rising generation is taught the language of eivillrttion and traiuod in habits of indus try they should assume the duties, privi leges aud responsibilities oi ci izeuship, no obstacles should hinder THE 

LOCATION AND SETTLEMENT OF ANY IN DIAN Willing to take land iv severaltv; on the the Inclination to do so should bo stimulated at all times when proper aud ex pedient, but there is no authority of law for making allcttments on some of the reserva tlons, and on others the allottinents pro vided for are so small that ludians, though ready aud desiring to settle down, are not willing to accept such small areas when their reservations contain ample lauds to afford them homesteads of sufficient size to meet their rreseut and future needs. These inequalities of the existing special lan sand treaties should be corrected and some gen eral legislation on the subject should be provided so that the more progressive mem bers of the different tribes may be settled upou homesteads and by their example learn others to loilow, breaking away from tribal customs nnd substituting therefore love for home, tbe interest of the family. The Indian character and nature are-such that they are not easily led while brooding over unadjusted wrongs This is especially so regarding their land matters arising from the construction and operation of railroads across some of the reservations, and the claims ol title and right of occu pancy Bet up by white persons to some ol the best land within other reservations, re quire legislation for their flual adjustment. The settlement of these matters will remove many embarrassments to progress iv tho work of leading the Indians to the adoption of our institutions aud bringing them under the operation, the Influence aud the protec tiou »f the universal laws of our country. The recommendations of the SECRETARY OF THE OENERAL LAND OFFICE, I Looking to the better protection of public lands and of the public surveys, the preser vation of nationsl forests, tho adjudication of grants to States and corporations, and ot private land claims, and the increased ef ficiency of the public service are com mended to the attention of Congress. To se cure the widest distribution of public land, and thus make the greatest number of in dividual homes, was the primary object of the public laud legislation in the early days of the Republic This system was a simple one It recommended that the humblest citizen could identify the tract upou which he wished to establish his home. THE I'RKB OF LAND WAS PLACED Within the reach of all the enterprising, Industrious and honest pioneer citizens of the country. It was soon, howover, found that the object of the laws was perverted under tbe system of cash sales from a dis ributiou of land among the peop c to an aeumulatlon of laud cspitalby wealtoy and speculative persons. To olieok this teu deuc a prcfc.rence right of purchase was given to settlers on the land, a plan which culminated in tbe general pre emption act of 1811 The foundation of this system was actual residence and cultivation. Twenty veers later the homestead laws, weredevised to more securely place actual homes in the i ossesslon of actual cultivators o' tne soil. The land was given without price, the sole conditions being residence, Improvement and cv Itivatlou. Other laws have followed, eaiih designed to encourage the acquire ment and use of laud In limited individual quantities. But iv lattT years these laws, turough vicious sdminlstration methods and uuder changed conditions of commu nication and traiisporituiou, have been so evaded and violated that their beneficent purpose is threatened with entire defeat. The methods of such evasions aud viola tlous arc set forth iv detail in the reports of the SEI'R ETA It V OF THE I NTF.r. IOR AND COMMIS SIONER OF THE QINEBAL LAND OFFICE. The rapid appropriation of our publi 0 lands without bouaflde settlements or cultl. vation, aud not only without intention of rcsideuce, but before the purpose of their aggregation in large holdings, in many cases, in tho hand of foreigners, Invites the serious and immediate attention of Congress. Tne energies of the Land Department have been devoted, during the present adminis tration to remedy defects and correct abuses iv the public land service. The results of these efforts are largely lv the nature of reforms In tho process and methods of our land systems to preveut sdequate estimates, but it appears by a compilation from the re ports of the Comuisslouers of the General Laud Oilice, that the Immediate effect in leading cases which have come to a final termination has been the 

RESTORATION TO THE MAM 09 PtllUC LANDS Of two millions seven hundred aud fifty thousand acres; that two millions three huudred and seventy thousand acres are em braced in investigations now pending for tie Department in the courts, or that actlou of Cor gress has beeu auked to effect the restoration of two miillous seven hundred aud ninety thousand acres, additloual: be sides which four millions acres have been withheld from reservnt.cn, aud the rights ol entry thereon maintained. I recommend the repeal of tl.e Pre-emtiou aud Timber Culture acts, aud that the Homestead laws be so amended as to better secure compli ance with, and cultivation for the period of five years from date of entry, without com mutation or provision lor speculative relin quishment; also recommend the repeal of tue Desert Land laws, unless it shall be the pleasure of the Cougress to so ameud these ,a*s as to render them less liable to abuse, as the chief motive tor the evasiou of the laws, aud the principal cause of their result iv laud distribution is the facility with which transfers are made of the right in tended to be secured to settlers. It may be deemed (dvisable to provide by legislation, some guards aud checks upou tho aliena tion of vested rights, and lands covered thereby until pateuts issue. Last year an executive proclamation was issued direct ing the removal of fences which enclosed the public domain. Mauy of these have beeu removed in obedience to such order, but MUCH OF THE PUBLIC LAND Still remains withiu the lines of the unlaw* iul fences. The ingenious methods resorted to in order to contrive these trespasses and the hardihood of the pretenses by which in some cases such iuclosures are justified, are fully detailed in the report of the Secre tary of the Interior. The removiug of the fences still remaining which enclose public lauds will be enforced with all the authority and means with which tbe executive branch of the government is or shall be Invested by the Congress iorthat purpose. The report oi THE COMMISSIONER OF PENSIONS, Is a detailed aud most satisfactory exhibit ol the operations of the Pension Bureau dur ing the last fiscal year. The amount ot work done was the largest in any i ear sinca the orgaui 'atlou of the bureau aud it has been done fit less cost than duriug the previous year lv every division. On the 80th day of June, ISSO, there were 1,667,088 pensioners on the rolls of the bureau. Since 1861 there have beeu 1,018,786 appdes. tious for pensions filed, of wnich 8,884 were bised upou service iv the war oi 1813. There were 021,7.",-! of these applica tions allowed, including 00,172, to the sol diers oi 1812 aud their widows. Tne total amount paid for pensions since the war of 1812 is 8808,624,811.57 The number of new ponsious allowed duriug the year ending June 30, lssG, is 40 s">7, a larger number than has been allowed iv any year save one since 1861, The namos oi 2x39 pensioners which had previously beeu dropped from the rolls were restored during the year, aud af ter deducting those dropped within the Santo time for various causes the interest remains for the year of 30,668 names. From Jauuary 1, 1881, to December 1,1880,1968 private pension acts had beeu pa-sed sine- 1 the last mentioned date and during the last session of Congress 044 such acts became laws. It seems to me that ho oue can examine our pension establish ment and its operations without beiug con vinced that through its instrumentality justice cau very nearly be done to all who are entitled under present laws to pension bounty of the Government. But it is unde niable that cases exist well entitled to re lief, iv which the Pension Bureau is power less to relieve. Tne really worthy cases oi this class are such as only lack by misfor tune the klud or quantity of proof which the law au 3 regulations of the Bureau re quire or which, though their merit is ap parent, for some other reason cannot be justly dealt with through general laws. These conditions fully justify applicatiou to the Congress and special enactments but report to tbe Congress ior a 

SPECIAL PENSION ACT. To overrule the deliberate and careful de termination of the Pension Bureau on their merits or to secure favorable action wheu it could not be expected under the most liberal execution of general laws, it mutt be admitted opens the door to the allowance of questionable claims, aud presents to the legislative and executive branches of the Government applications concededly not withiu the law uud plainly devoid of merit, but so surpouuded by sentiment and pat riotic feeling that they are hard to resist. I suppose it will not be denied thut many claims for pensions are made without merit, and tnat many bavo been allowed ou fraud ulent representations. This has beeu de clared from the Pension Bureau not ouly iv this but in prior admiuistratious. The use fulness aud the justice of any system lor the distributions of pensions depends ou the equality and uniformity of its opera tion. It will be seen from the re port of the Commissioner that there are vow paid by the Government 131 different rates of pension. He estimates from the best information he can oDtaiu that IHIOO of those who have served iv the army and uavy of the United State s are now supported lv whole or in part from public fuiids or by organized charities, exclusive of those iv SOLDIERS' HOMES I S ISK It THE DIRECTION And control oi the government. Only thirt een per cent, of these are pensioners, while of the entire number of men famished for the late war, something like twenty per cent, including their widows aud relatives have been or are now iv the receipt of pen sions. The American people, with a patri otic, grateful reward for our ex-soldiers, too broad aud too sacred to be mouopolized by any special advocates, are not oniy will ing but anxious that equal and exact jus tico should be done to ail honest claims and for pensions iv their sight. The friendless aud destitute soldier dependent upon pub lic charity. If otherwise eutitled has precise ly the same right to share iv the provision maae for those who fought their country's buttle as th-use better able through friends aud iullueuce to push their claims. Every pension that is grained under our present plan upou auy other grounds than actual service, Injury or disease incurred In such service are increased on other grouuds than the merits of the claim, work au iujtisticc to the brave aud crippled BUT I'OOIt AND 

FRIBNDLRBS SOLDIER Who is entirely neglected, and who mutt be content Willi the smallest sum allowed un the general laws. There are far 100 many neighborhoods iv whioh are found glaring cases of inequality of treatment in the mat ter of pension, aud they are largely due to a yielding iv the feusiou Bureau to impor tunity ou the part of those other than tho peuslouer, who are especially interested, or ihey ariso from special acts passed for the beueflt of individuals. Meu who fought side by side should stand side by side wheu they participate iv a grateful nation's kind remembrance. Every consideration of iairuess and justice to our ex-soldiers, and the protection of the patriotio instincts of our citizens Irorn perversion ami violence, point to the adoption oi a peuslou system, broad aud comprehensive enough to cover eveiy contingency and winch shall make unnecessary aud objeciionnblu volume of special legislation, a* long as we srnill adhere to tue pnuclpie of granting pensions for the services aud dlsibility as the result of the scrvloe: the allowance of pt-usious should be re stricted to cases presenting these leatures. Every patriotic heart responds to a tender consideration for those woo, having served their country long aud well, are reduced to destitution aud dependence, not as au luol deut of their service, but with ADVANCINU AUK, OB THRUt'OU SICKNESS OR MISFORTUNE. We are all tempted by the contemplation of such a oouditlou to supply relief, aud are often Impatient of the limitations of pub ie duty. Yielding to no one in tbe desire to Indulge this feeling of consideration, I can uot rid myself of the convlotion that if these LOS ANGELES DAILY HEKALD, DECEMBER 7, 1886. ex-soldiers are to bi relieved, they and their cause are eutitled to the benefit of .au enactment under which relief may be claimed as a right, and that such relief should be granted under the Bamtlou nf law, not In evasion of if. nor should such worthy objects ol care, all equally entitled, be remitted to Ihe unequal operation of sympathy of the tender mcrclei of social and political iulluence, with I heir unjust dis criminations. The discharged soldiers and sailors of the country are our fellow-citizens, and interested with us in the passsage and fullest execution of wholesome law. They can t be severed from their duty of citizen ship by artful appeal tothelr spirit of broth ertiood, born of common peril aud suffer ing nor will they exact as a test of devotion totiicir welfsre a willingness to neglect public duty In their behalf. On the 4th oi March, 1885. THE CURRENT IH'SINESS OF THE PATENT OFFICE Was on an average five aud a half months behind. At the close of the last fiscal year such current work was but three months In arrears and it is asserted and believed that in the next few months the delay in obtain lug au ctamination of an spplicallou lor a patent will 00 but nominal. The number of applications for patents during the last fiscal year, including reissue designs, trade-marks aud labels,equals -I ',578, which is considerably In excess ol the number received duriug the preceding year. The receipts of tbe Patent Oilice during the year aggregated $1,250,107.80, enabling the oftice to turn into the treasury over and above all expendilures of about 11,1387,178, Tho number ol patents granted during the last fiscal year, including re-issues, trade marks, designs aud labels was 25,019. a number also quite largely In excess of that of any preceding year. The report of the Commissioner shows the oftice to be in a prosperous condition aud constantly In creasing in its business. No increase of the force Is asked for. The amount estimated for the year ending June 3Jth, 188", was 6858,910, The amount estimated for the fis cal year ending June. 110 th, 18*8, is 8778,770. The Secretary of the Interior suggests a change iv the plan of payment for THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE [PACIFIC SUBSI DIZED lIOADB to the government. His suggestion has the unanimous endorsement of the persons selected by the government to act as Direct ors of these roads and protect the Interests of the United States in the Board of Direct ors. In considering the plau proiosed, the solo matters which should be taken into accouut, iv my opinion, are the situation of the Government as a creditor.and the surest way to secure a payment of the principal and interest of its dcbt| by a recent declsn v ot the Supreme Court of tbe United States. It has been adjudged that the laws of the several Sta.es are luoperntive to regulate rates of transportation upon railroads, if such regulation interfere with the rate of carriage from oue State into another. This Important field of control nnd regulation haviug been thus left entirely unoccupied, the expediency of federsl action upou the subject is worthy of consideration. THE RELATION OF LABOR TO CAPITAL, And of laboring men to their employers is of the utmost concern to every patriotic citi-en, when strained, distorted, un justifiable claims are apt to be insisted uton by both interested, and in the contro versy which results the welfare of all uud the prosperity of tbe country are jeopard ized. Auy Intervention of the general Gov ernment withiu the limits of its constitu tional authority to avert such a condition should be willingly accorded in a special message, transmitted to the Congress at the last session, I suggested the enlargement of our present Labor Bureau, and adding to Its present functions the power of 

ARBITRATION IN cases WHERE IHFFEIiENir.s Arise between employes and employers. When these difficulties reach such a stage as to result iv the iuterruption of commerce between the States, the application of this remedy by the general government might he regarded as entirely withiu its constitu tional power. I thiuk we might reasonably hope that such arbitration, if carefully se lecicd and ii entitled to the confidence of the parties to be affected, would be volun tarily called to the settlement of contro versy of less extent, and not necessarily within the domain of Federal regulation. I am of opinion that this su gestlou i» worthy the attention of Congress, but after all has been done by the passage of laws, either Federal or State, to relieve a situation full of solicitude, much more remains to he accomplished by tbe reinstatement arid cultivation of a true Americiu sentiment which recignizes the equality of Amer ican citizenship. The Department of Agriculture, represeutiug the oldest and largest of national Industries, ii sub serving well the purposes of its organisa tion. By the Introduction of uew subjects of larming enterprise and by opening new sources of agricultural wealth and the dis semination of early iuformatiou concerning productiou and prices, it has contributed largely to the country's prosperity. Through this ageucv advanced thought and investi gation touching the subjects it has iv charge should, among other thlugs, be practically applied to the home production at a low cost, of articles offered wnich are now im ported from abroad. Such an innovation will ueces-sarily, ol course, iv the net-inning be within tbe domain of iiitelligeut experi ment and the subject iv every stage should receive all po sible ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT. The iuterests oi millions of our citlzeus engaged iv agriculture, involved in the en largement and Improvement oi the results of their labor, and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those whose productive returns are a main source of our progress aud power. The existence of pleuro-pueumonia among the cattle oi various States has led to bur densome and, iv some cases, disastrous re strictions In au important branch of our commerce, threatening to effect the quanti ty of the supply. This is a matter of such Importance and of such far-reaching conse quences that I hope It will engage the seri ous attention of the Congress to the cud that such a remedy may be applied as to the limits of a constitutional delegation of power to the generalj-overiiinent will permit, i commed to the consideration of the Con gress the report of the Commissioner and his suggestions conceruintr the iuterests en trusted to his care. The continued opera tion ot the law RELATING TO OUR CIVIL SERVICE Has added to the most convincing proofs of its necessity and its usefuluess. It is a fact worthy of note, andevery public officer who has a just idea of his duty to tho people tes tifies to the value of this reform. Its stauuehest friends are found among those who understand it best, and Its warmest supporters are those who are restrained aud protected by its requirements. Tbe mean ing ot such restraint aud protection is not iully appreciated by those who want places uuder tbe government regardless of merit aud efficiency, nor by those who insist that elections for such places, should rest on proper CREDENTIALS SHOWING ACTIVI PARTISAN WORK. It Is exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform are so little understood. aud that so many things not included with, iv its plan are called by its name. When civil service vlelds more fully to examine tion, the system will have large auditions to the number of its friends. Your civil service reiorm may be imper fect in some of its details, it may be misunderstood and opposed, but I invoke for this reform the cheerful aud ungrudging support of the Congress, i renew my recom mendation made last yearth at com missioners be made equal to other officers of the government, haviug like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reas onable appropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the useful uess of the cause they have ohurtie of. 1 de sire to call the attention of the Congress lo a plain duty which this Government owes to the depositors in the FREEDMAN HAVINUS ,t TBI*ST COMPANY. This company was chartered by the Con großSforthe benefit of the most Illiterate and humble of our people aud with tbe in tention of encouraging in their iudustry and thrift most of us. Brauches we c Pre sided over by officers holding commissions and clothed with the uniform of the United States. These sud other circum stances, I think, lead these simple people to suppose that tbe invitation to deposit their hard-earned savings in this institu tion imolied au undertaking ou the part of their government that their money should be safely kept for tbtin. When this oompany failed 1' was liable in the sum of $2.989,y25.22 to 61,111 depositors. Dividends amounting lv the aggregate to 60 per cent, have been declared and the sum called for and paid of such dividends seems to be 11.018,181.72. This Hum deducted from the entire amount of deposits leaves 1,791,711,60 still unpaid. Past experieuce has shown that quite a large part of this sum will not be called for. There are assets still on hand amounting as estimated to the sum ol 610,000 I think the remaining thirty eight percent, of each of these deposits of claimants should be paid by the govern meut upon the principle of equity aud fair ness. Tne report of the Commissioner soon to bo laid before Congress will give more satisfactory details on this subject. The control Of the AFFAIRS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Having beeu placed In the bands of purely executive officers while the Congress still retains legislative authority relating to its government, il becomes my duty tp make •mown the most pressing needs of the dis triot, and then recommend their conslderu tiou. The laws of the district appear to be i i an uncertain and unsatisfactory coudi tlon and their codification or revisiou Is much needed. During tbe past year one of the bridges leadiug from the district to the State of Virginia became uuflt for use aud travel upon It was forbidden. This leads me to suggest now that the improvement of all bridges crossing the Potomac and lis branches Irom the city of Washington, is worthy tbe atteutlou of Congress. The com missioners of the district represent that the laws regulating the sale of liquors and granting licenses theretcr should be at ouce amended, and that legislation is need ed to eousolidate, defluo and en large the scope and powers of charitable and pcual Institutions within the district. I suggest the Commissioner he clothed with the power to make, within fixed limitation, police regulations. I believe this power granted, aud carefully observed, would tend to sub-erve tbe good order of the mv nicipality. It seems that trouble exists, growing out of the occupation of the streets aud avenues by certain railroads haviug their termini in the city. U 16 very im portaut that such laws should be enacted upou this subject as will secure to the rail roads all faculties required lor the trans action of their business and at the same time protect citizens-.from injury to their per sons or property. The Commissioners agsiu complatn that the accommodations afforded them for the necessary offices for district business and for the safe keeping of valua ble books and papers, are eutirelv iueffi cieut. 1 recommend that this condition of affairs be remedied by the Congress and that suitable quarters be furnlihed for the needs of the district government IN CONCLUSION, 1 EARNESTLY Invoke such actlou on the part ol the peo ple's legislators as will subserve the public good and demonstrate during the remain ing days of the Congress, as at present or ganized, its ability aud inclination to so meet the people's needs that it shall be grateiully remembered by au expectant constituency.

'Washington, d. a, Dec 6,1886.— For au hour before noon to-day the floor of the House present ed an enlivening appoarauce. Groups of members crowded the cloak rooms and blocked tbe aisles, exchang. ing congratulations of success in the re cent elections, or condolence upon de feat. Victors twitted the vanquished and the vanquished commiserated the victors upon their failure to throw off the burden of public life. Citizens of Washington, kept there by unpropitious weather, crowded tbe galleries and looked down with interest and amusement on tbe scene being enacted there. The Executive and diplomatic galleries were, however, conspicuously empty. The desks of va rious members were adorned with floral decorations. The Speaker was not for uotten, aud h's desk was plenteously adorned, while congratulations abound ed. Those offered to Hewitt were ap parently the most earnest, and he was kept busy shaking liauds with politic il friends aud foes, who seemed to' agree with each other in expressing tbe heart iest good will and good wishes. The Chaplain delivered a prayer, in which he feelingly referred to the deaths of Rep resentatives \each and Arnot, and invoked the Divine supervision over the proceedings of Congress in obedience to the dictation of the Speaker, the Clerk proceeded to call the roll, wheu 245 members re sponded. The House met precisely at 12 M. and after the adoption of a resolution direct ing the Clerk t3 inform She Senate that the House was ready for business und the appointment of v committee to join a similar committee appointed by the Senate to wait on the President, a recess was taken Until 2 o'olock. Ou reassembling Hewitt, of New York, rising to a question of privilege, asked that S. S. Cox should be sworn iv as a member of the House to till the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joseph PdlUlcer, He stated at the same time that the formal certilicate of Coxe's election had been r ceived, and uo objection was made to Coxe's quali fying. His personal popularity was manifested by the round of applause which greeted his re-entry into legis lative life. Henry W. Husk, of Mary land, and Henry Bacon, of New York, also appeared at the bar of the House and qaalitied, filling vacancies caused by the deaths of William H. Cole and Lewis Beach. The President's message was listened to with much attention oy members of the House until that portion which dis cusses the tariff questiou had been read, when interest slackened and the re mainder of the message found few listeners. The document was then or dered printed and referred to tbe Com mittee ef the W 7 hole. Mr. Hewitt, of New York, announced to the House the deaths of late Con gressmen from New York, Lewis Brush uud John Arnot, Jr., and a similar duty was performed by Mr. Carroll, of Wis consin, who announced the death of bis colleague, W. I*. Price. A committee consisting of Messrs. t'uenther, Morrill, Frederick, Fauber, Oabourne, Hurd and Lan Lafollette were appointed to attend Mr. Price's funeral, and then as a mark of respect to the deceased Representa tives, the House adjourned. tt ashing lon Notes. Washington, December (i.—Repre sentative Curtin has issued a call for meeting his special labor oommittee to morrow, to outline a plan of procedure in compiling its report.

Reduction of the Old WgT Times Taxes Earnestly Advised. [Special lv the Uiarlil bytkt Associatid Preen Washington, December 6.—The re port of Dnuiel Manning, Secretary of the Treasury, is devoted very largely to the consideration of the silver question, one-half of the printed report being given up to it. The Secretary argues agaiust the coinage, and says: "To stop the purchase of silvor is our only choice, our duty and our interest. It will Btop a wasteful and injurious expense and the taxation which defrays it. It will commence and promote reform in the sum and methods of Federal taxation. It will recover to the United States an equality of position—the non-coinage — with foreign powers, which will give us due influence in negotiation. It will in duce negotiation, aud negotiation to the end of relief, aud not for the purpose of delay." Ho continues on tbis point: "If to manufacture and store or distrib ute tbe coin of a depreciated metal could stop its depreciation or relieve the depressiou of trade, or improve the money circulation or call out into use for the employment of labor more of tbe tenable capital or arrest the drop iv price the the treasury trouble and tax burden would have some offset, but it dots the reverse. It inspires the own ers, borrowers and employers of capital who organize work for workingmen to do so with an utterly incurable distrust. It is a reasonable distrußt which every man who has earned and saved five dol lars that he would like to employ or loan, as capital knows as well as those who have saved thousands of dollars from their earnings. Every wage earn er too knows as well as they that silver inflation has not stimulated aud does not stimulate industry or trade. Silver has never been as low as this year, 42 pence, although the Treasury has bought and stamped ?50, --000,000 of it in the last eight years, l'rices of all commodities range lower than in any previous year of the nine teenth century." He finally says: "If the law was re pealed which makes compulsory treas ury purchases of silver, aud if that re peal was accomi anicd by a declaration of Congress that the United States now uold themselves iv readiness to unite with France, Germany and Great Britain in opening their mints to the free coiuage ofjsilver and gold ut rates fixed by inter, national agreement, it is the deliberate judgemem of the undersigned that before tbe expiration of an other fissal year this international monetary location might be corrected by such international coucurreuce the two monetary metals restored to their old and universal function and the standard measure of prices for the world's commodities the depression of trade and industry be relieved and gen eral prosperity renewed. Besides the repeal of the Silver Purchase act he urges.the repeal of the act for Ihe com pulsory part of redemption of the issue and re-issue of legal tender notes- coin not promises is fit for legal tender. The tariff on raw materials is attacked by the Secretary, who says the field of Federal taxes is nt hnd, not incomes, but tilings here consumed. With in laud and seaport collections of taxes is the declaration of principles in relation to taxation and protection is not at tacked. Where trade is tree as within all the ununited States of Europe as it is among the United States of America, the great surplus products of our indus try, iucluding the manufactures, would have the pick of foreign markets, for the reason that our labor, beiug most highly piid, and insuring the very largest" percentage of labor the cost would everywhere surpass our rivals. Great Britain would follow next, for next to our laborer her's is the highest paid, therefore the next in effecting, by a low percentage of labor »cost of her chief products. France aud Ger many would follow next aud command the unsupplied markets, and last of all, at the foot of tbe list and quite unable to compete with v single rival iv what ever that rival choose to produce, would come the pauper labor of Europe and Asia. Low wages of pauper labor signify the least efficiency, which is but another niine for the highest percentage of labor cost in the prt duct. Other things being equal it is obvious that high wages can never be paid unless it is proii table to pay them, and it can on'y be good business to pay tbe highest wages, because the erbcieucy of those who earn them vindicates its superiority by the reduction of labor cost in the product. High wages to la bor and cheaper products are correlat ye terms. Low wages to labor and costlier product are correlative terms. One im plies Ihe other - Whenever labor com petes with labor upon otherwise equal ground what pauper stands any chance of competing with intelligent artisans? The "pauper labor of Europe" cry is a bugaboo except that in truth our war tariff taxes favor "pauper labor" at the expense ot American labor. Its products are not fenced out by our tariff laws, they come in because we our selves destroy our own easy power of competition, even in our home market by tariff taxes on raw material. We feuce in our own surplus products, mak ing them cost too much to compete at home and of course too much to compete abroad with manufactures from untaxed raw materials. I M.I Ivll VIEWS On Hu President* OT>k«ii|re on the t'ikberiee. Lonuos, December 6.—The Dai\i/ jyins* commenting on the last part of the President's message referring to the fisheries question, says: "The two gov ernments ought not to allow themselves to rest until they have arranged the question. The diriicully seems to be that America wants fishing while New England does nut want free Inule. The same insatiable greed for protection un derlies the difficulty about the disposal of the surplus revenue. Protection will die hard in America. It is however te ginning to be regarded with increasing popular mistrust. The proposed revision of the tariff' may be tbe beginning of the end. The Daily Telegraph says: Never were words included in a message which more deserved earnest and prompt attention of the British Ministry. To leave the dis pute open, if it can in any way be adjusted would be the height of crim inal short gightednesß. The Standard says that the Presi dent's message is an able and Btataman like production and eminently pacific. A word of menace is not heard although in describing the fisheries question he' throws undue blame on Canadian fisher men. Yet not a word is spoken to ex cite hosljlity or engender strife. The Times, commenting on President Cleveland's message, says: "It is for tunate for both parties that negotiations are in the hands of governments in stead of those of tbe immediate disput ants in the fishery question. Opposing interests in America seem too strong fotf any movement toware free trade." The I . S. viui'siiniviiip. San Francisco, December 6. — A special to the Examiner to-night from Washington says: M'esers. A. W. Bar rett aud N. A. Covarrubias, of Los An geles, two of the candidates for Marshal of the Southern District of California, are in the city. Both gentlemen have had interviews with the Attorvey Gen eral upon the subject. Barrett will have the influence of Solicitor General JeDks, while Justice Field will champion Covarrubias' cause. The best judgment of those interested in the matter is that the Marshalship will be given to Sydney Lacey, of Los Angelas, as it is believed bis influence is such as the administrat on desires most to conciliate. The Attorney (leneral, however, speaks well of Mr. Barrett. It is not knowu, however, who tbe Attorney.General has recom mended. All papers iv the case are i.ow on tbe President's table. It is thought that the nomination for Judge, Distrot Attorney nnd Marshal will all be sent to the Senate not later than Tuesday. I In' illusion Fete.

San Francisco, December 6.—lt is said that a hitch has taken place in the negotiations for the transfer of the South Pacitic Coast road. Senator Fair, it ap pears, desires bonds to be given in seg ment by the road, to be indorsed by the Central Pacific Railroad Company, while the directors of the Southern Pa cific wish to issue them of tbe Southern Pacific. Owing to the fact that the Cen tral Pacitic is leased by the Southern Pacific it is doubtful whether bonds en dorsed by it have any legal value. Messrs. Huntington and Crocker have been communicated with and it is ex pected that tne matter will bi settled within a few days.
