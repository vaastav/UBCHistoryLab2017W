OCR NATIONAL PROSPERITY. "' We are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit has greatly improved, and is perhaps now stronger than ever . before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil. Our manufactur ing' industries a-e reviving, and it is believed that the general prosperity which has been so long anxiously looked for is at last within our reach. THE FEVER PLAOITE. The enjoyment of health by our people gen erally has, however, been interrupted during the past' season by the prevalence of the fatal pestilence of yellow fever in some por tions ot the Southern States, creating an emergency which called for prompt and extra ordinary measures of relief. The disease ap peared as an epidemic at New Orleans and other places in the. lower. Mississippi" soon after midsummer It was rapidly spread by fugitives from infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early in November. Tue States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Ten uesBee have suflered severely. About 100,000 cases are believed to have occurred, of which about 20,000, according to intelligent esti mates, proved fatal. It is impossible to esti mate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by hundreds of millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the union, physicians and nurses has tening from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntary contri butions of money and supplies in every needed form were speeddy and generously furnished. The government was able to respond in some measure to the call for help by 'providing tents, medicine and rations for the sick and destitute, requisite directions for this purpose being given in confident expectation that this action of the executive would receive the sanction of Congress. About 1,800 tents and rations of the value of about $2o,000 were sent to the cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper department. . SANITARY GOVERNMENT. The fearful spread of the pestilence has awakened a very general public sentiment iu favor of a national sanitary administration, which shall not only control quarantine, but have sanitary supervision of internal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold in advisory re lation to State and municipal health authori ties, with power to deal with whatever en danger the public health, and which the municipal and State authorities are unable to regulate. The national quarantine act, ap proved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to provide means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season, is a step in the direc tion here indicated. In view ot the necessity for the most effective measures, by quaran tine and otherwise for the protection of sea ports and the country generally from this and other epidemics, it is recommended that Con gress give the whole subject early and careful consideration. ' THE EIGHTS OF CITIZENS. The permanent pacibcation of the country by the complete protection of all citizens in every civil and political right, continues to be of paramount interest with the great body of our people. Every step in this direction is welcoiued with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uniform progress to the desired consummation awakens general uneasiness and widespread condemnation. Recent Congressional elections have furnished a direct and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical establishment of the right of suffrage, secured by the con stitution to the liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, real and imaginary, have been wiped from all these States. Three constitutional amendments, which conferred freedom and equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens who maintained the authorities of the national government and the integrity and perpetuity of the onion at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the just results of the war. The people ot the former slave-holding States accepted these results, and gave injevery prac tical form assurances that the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, and laws passed in pursu ance thereof, should in good faith be enforced rigidly and impartially in' letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, should under them receive full and equal protection in person and property, and in political rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments and in crease of political power in Congress and the electoral college, the country justly expected that elections would proceed as to 'the en franchised race upon tne same circumstances of legal and constitutional freedom and pro tection which obtained in all other States in the Union. The friends of law and order looked forward to the conduct of these elec tions as offtri'jg to the general judgment of the country au important opportunity to meas ure the degree in which tne tight ot suiti-age could be exercised by the colored people, and would be respected by their fellow citizens. but more general enjoyment of tne Ireeoom of suffrage by colored people; and more just ana generous protection ut that freedom uy the communities of which they form a part, were more generally anticipated than the record of elections discloses. I THE ELECTION OOTBAOKS. In some of those States the colored people have been unable to make their opinions felt in the elections. This result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied by legal protection. But in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina, at large, and in some particular congressional districts out side of those States, the records of election seem to compel the conclusion that the rights oi me colored voters have been overridden. and their participation in elections not per mitted to be either general or free. It will be for Congress, for which these elections were held, to make such examination intojtheir conduct as may appropriately determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meantime it becomes the duty of the executive and judicial departments of the government, each in its province, to in quire into and punish violations of the laws of the United btutrs which have occurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection in my List message, that whatever authority rests with me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to ineiegisiatures.the courts. the executive authorities and the people of tho States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance toward bringing to justice the offenders and prevent ing a repetition of the crimes. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of alleged crimes, and to secure conviction and just punish ment of the guilty. It is to be observed that the principal ap propriation made for the department of jus tice at the last session, contained the follow ing clause: "And for defrayirtbs expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act, approved February 23, 1871, entitled an act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to enforce rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several States of the union, and for other purposes, or any acts amendatory thereof, or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion of the Attorney General that the expenses of these proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and I rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations to enable the executive de partment to enforce the laws. I respectfully urge your attention that congressional elec tions in every district,- in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political interest and concern throughout the whole country. Each State and every political party is enti tled to the share of power which is conferred by legal and constitutional suffrage and it is the right of every citizen possessing the qualifications prescribed by btw to cast one nnintimidated ballot and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exercise of this power , and the enjoyment of this right ' are common and equal practically, as well as' formally, submission to ' the results of the suffrage will be accorded loy ally and cheerfully, and all the departments of the government will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No tempo rary or administrative interests of the gov ernment, however urgent or weighty, will ever display the zeal of our people in the defense of the primary rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of lib erty requires the maintenance in full vigor of the manly methods of free speech, free press and free suffrage, and will sustain the full authority of the government to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights. . " The material progress and welfare of the States depend on the protection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace with out such protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is deeply inter ested in the growth and prosperity of all its partB. While the country has not yet reached complete unity of feeling and reciprocal con fidence between the communities so lately and so seriously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with increasing force the pow er of public opinion will override all politi cal prejudice and all sectional or State at tachments in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of a citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them un challenged security and respect. Our relations with other countries continue peaceful. Our neutrality in contests between foreign powers has been maintained and re spected. TH1C PARIS EXPOSITION. The universal exposition held at Paris dur ing the past summer has been attended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and ar rangement of the contributions of our citi zens to this great exposition was well em ployed in energetic and judicious efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These efforts, led and directed by the commissioners gen eral, were remarkably successful, and the exhibition of products of American industry was creditable -and gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the U. 8. com missioners, giving its results in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international competition for the fa vor and the trade of the world may be ex pected to produce useful and important re sults in promoting intercourse, friendship and commerce with other nations. ' THK XNTEBNATXONAXi CONFERENCE. " In accordance with the provisions of the act of Febrnaay 28, 1878, three commission ers were appointed to the international con ference on the subject of the adoption of a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing internationally the use of bi-metallio money, and securing a fixity of the relative value between those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had expressed willingness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held its meeting in Paris in August last'. The report of the commission ers herewith submitted will show its results. No common ratio between - gold and silver could be agreed upon by the conference. A general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in the world the mon etary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of both, to be made by each State. THK HALIFAX AWARD. Congress appropriated at its last session the sum of $5,500,000 to pay the award of the joint commission at Halifax, if after corres pondence with the British government on the subject of conformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submitted to the commission, the President shall tleeni it his duty to make payment. Communications upon these points were addressed to the Brit ish government through the legation of the United States at London. Failing to ob tain the concurrence of the. British govern ment in the views of the government respect ing this award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the Bum named within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds of payment and a protest sguinst any other construction of the same. Corres pondence upon this . subject will be laid be fore you. . , y . CUBA AND TUB WAS CLAIMS OF AMERICANS. The Spanish government has officially an nounced the termination of the insurrection in Cuba and the restoration of peace through out that island. Confident expectations are expressed of the revival of trade and pros perity, which, it is earnestly hoped may prove well founded. Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of property have been among the incidents-of the long continued hostilities. Some of thse claims are in process of ad justment by Spain and the others are prom ised onarly consideration. TBI TBIATT WITH IT ALT. Tb -treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal treaty consular privileges has been duly ratified laid proclaimed. No ques tions of grave importance have arisen with any of the other European powers. RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. '5 The Japanese government has been de sirous of the revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and it is understood, has address ed to each of the treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view. The Uni ted States government has beea inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever re strictions upon trade with Japan, are found injurious to that people cannot but affect in juriously nations holding commercial inter course with them. Japan, after "a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides in the pithoi en- lightment and progress, and is not unreason ably looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe ana America shall be assimilated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end has been made which will be submitted for the consderation of the Sen ate. i- V :.". THE CH1HESB LKOAilOX. , After an interval of several years the Chi nese government has again sjnt envoys to the United States,' They have been received and a permanent legation is now established here by that government. It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations, in promoting friendly relations and removing causes I differences. THE BAMOAN ISLANDS. The treaty with the Samoan Islands has been duly ratified and accepted on the part of both governments, and is now in opera tion, and a survey and soundings of the har bor of Pago Pago has been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with the view of its occupation as a naval station, if found desirable to the service. GELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Since the resumption of diplomatic rela tions with Mexico, correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two which at one .time seemed to endanger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and diminish them.' The effective force of U. S. troops on the Bio Grade, by strict aud faithful com pliance with instructions, has done much to remove sources of dispute,. and it is now un derstood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also making an energetic movement against marauding Indian tribes. This government looks with greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength in the national authority of Mex ico, and upon every effort put forth to pre vent or punish incursions, upon our territory and it is reluctant to assume any action or attitude in the control of these incursions by military movements across the border not imperatively demanded for the protection of the lives and property of our citizens. I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with the proper discbarge of this plain duty to recognize the ability of the Mexican gov ernment to restrain effectively all violations of our territory. It is proposed to hold next year an international exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of agricul tural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend to a better understanding and increased commercial intercourse between their people. SOUTH AMEBIC A. With Brazil and the republics of Central and South America, some steps have been taken toward the development of closer com mercial intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Columbia and with Bolivia. The boundary question between the Argentine Kepublic and Paraguay has been submitted by those governments for arbitration to the President of the United States, and I have, after careful examina tion, given a decision upon it. A naval ex pedition up the Amazon and Maderia rivers has brought back information valuable for scientific and commercial purposes. A like expedition is visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian ocean. 1 FOIIEIGN COMMEECK. ' The reports of diplomatic and consular of ficers in relation the development of our for eign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our people. THE CONDITION OF THE TBEASTJBT. The report of the secretary of the treasury furnishes a detailed statement of operations of that department of the government, and of the condition of the public finance. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, were $257, 763,878 70. The ordinary expenditures for the same period were $23C,9G4,32C 80. Leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $20,799,551 90. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, actual aud estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1878, Actual expenditures, 73,344,573 27, and for the remaining three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated Bt $160,755, 426 73, making the total expenditures $240, 100.0U0; and leaving the estimated surplus revenue for the year ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, esti mated according to existing laws, will be 9-!b4, 500,000; and the estimated ordinary ex penditures for the same period will be $236, 320,912 68, leaving a surplus of 28,279,577 32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund pro vided for by act approved February 25. 18G2, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By its terms the public debt should have been reduced between 1862 and the close of the lust fiscal year, $518,361,806 28. The actual reduction of the ascertained debt in that period has been $720,644,730 61, being in excess of the reduction required bv the sink ing fund act of $20,228,292 43. . The amount of the public debt less cash in the treasury Nov. 1, 1878, was $2,024,200,083 1, a reduction since the same date of last year of $23,150,617 30. The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at lower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of four per cent, bonds sold duringa . J . X V OOJ II... 1 uie preseuiyear prior luuvemwriou, aoo, is $100,270,900, and six per cent bonds, commonly known as "five twenties" to equal amount have been or will be redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of the department to place the four per cent, bonds within easy reach of , every citizen who de sires to invest his savings, whether small or great, in these securities. The secretary of the treasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested through the post offices or other agents of the government. The freest opportunity should be tiven In all parts of the country for such investments. The best mode sug gested is that the department be authorized to issue certificates of denomiaations of $10 bearing interest at the rate of 3.5 per cent per annum, and contrivertible at any time within one year after issue, into 4 per cent, bonds authorized by the refunded act, and to be issued only in exchange for U. S. notes Bent to the treasury by mail. Or, otherwise such provisions of law supported by suita ble regulations wonld enable any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into interest bearing securities of the United States, and money so received could be applied to the redemption of 6 per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold during the fis cal year was $52,798,980. . THE 

SILVER DOLLAR AND EESCMPTIOX. The coinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 28, 1878, amounted on the 23d of November, 1878. to $19,314,550. of which amount $4,984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in the possession of the government. With views unchanged with regard to the act under which the coinage of Bilver proceeds, it has been the purpose ot the secretary faithfully to execute the law and to afford a new trial to the measure. In the present financial condi tion of the country, I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and indus try of every description will be best promoted by abstaining trom all attempts to make radi cal changes in existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be undis turbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidentially expect that the resumption of specie payments Which will take place at the appointed time will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will be followed by a healthy and en durinz revival of business prosperity.- Let the healing influence of time, the inherent energies of our people and the boundless re sources of our country have a fair opportunity and relief from present difficulties will rarely iousir. ARMY MATTERS. The report of the secretary of war shows that the army has been well and economi cally supplied; that our small force has been actively employed and have faithfully per formed all the service required of it The morals of the army has improved and the number of deserters has materially .decreased during the year. The secretary recommends, First That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H. Ben ner, of the 18th infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease. Second For the establishment of the an nuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs of deceased officers, as suggested by the pay master general. - " Third The adoption by Congress f a plan for the publication of the records of the war of the rebellion now being prepared for that purpose. Fourth The increase of the extra per diem of soldiers teachers employed in post schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings for schools and libraries at the dif ferent posts. Fifth The repeal or amendment of the act of June 18tb, 1878, forbidding the use of the army as a jtotuw eomilalm or otherwise for the purpose of executing the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the constitu tion or by act of Congress. Sixth The passage of a joint resolution of Congress, legalizing the issues of rations, tents and mediciuea which were made for the relief of sufferers from yellow fever. Seventh That provision be made for the erection of a fire proof building for the pres ervation of certain valuable records now con stantly exposed to destruction by tire. These recommendations are all commended to your favorable consideration, t NAVAL AFFAIRS. j The report of the secretary of the navy shows that the navy has improved during the last fiscal year.- Work has been done on 7.) vessela, 10 of which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready foi sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward com pletion. The total expenditures of the year, including the amount appropriated for the deficiencies of th'e previous " year, were $17,468,392 65. The actual expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,300, 914 09, or $767,199 18 less than thoe of the previous year, aud $4,928,677 74 less than the expenses including the deficiencies. '! The es timates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18S0, are $l4,562.3Sl 45, exceeding the ap propriations of the present year only $33,949, 75, which excess' is. accounted for by the de mands of the iiaval academy and marine corjw, as explained in the secretary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $1,452,843 "0 which, in the opinion of the secretary, will be ample for all the current ex penses of the department during the year. The amount drawn from the treasury from July 1st to November 1st, 1S78, is $4,740,544 14, of which $70,9SO 75 tias been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period, $4,669,563 39, or $520,899 24 less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. THE 

POSTAL SERVICE. The report ot the postmaster general em braces a detailed statemeut of the operations of the post office department. The expendi tures of the department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S73, were $34, 165,084 49-100. Receipts, including the sale of stamps, money order business and olncial stamps, were $29, 277,519 95. The sum of $290,438 93, in cluded iu the foregoing statement of expendi tures, is chargeable to the preceding years, so that the actual expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 187S, are $33,874,647 50. The amount drawn from the treasury ou appro priation, in addition to the revenues of the de partment, was $5,307,652 82. The expendi tures tor tne tiscal year ending June 30, loiv, are estimated at $36,571,900, and the receipts from all sources at $30, 664,023 90, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the treasury ot $j,904,86 10. lhe report calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters of railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that the failure of Congress to appropriate the amounts re quired tor these purposes does not relieve the government of the responsibility, but necessarily increases the deficiency bills, which Congress will be called upon to pass in providing for postal service. The following questious are presented : Should Congress finally appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of josta;.e be established as will make the department self-sustaining? Should the postal i-ervice be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way ? Should the number of p;st routes be diminished ? Should ; other methods be adopted which will imrease the revenues or diminish the expenses of postal service ? 

UNIVERSAL POSTAL SERVICE. The international postal congress, which met at Paris, May 1, 1878, and continued in session until June 4th of the same year, was composed of delegates from nearly all civil ized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention to take the place of a treaty concluded at Berne, October 9, 1864. Such convention goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1379, between the countries whose dele gates have signed. : It was ratified aud ap proved by aud with the consent of the presi dent,, August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this uni versal postal convention will be found in the report of the postmaster general and the full text in the appendix thereto. In its origin the postal union comprised 23 countries, hav ing a populatiou of 350,000,000 of people. On the 1st of April next it will comprise 43 countries aud colonies, with a population Of more than 650,000,000 of people, and will soon, by the accession of the tew remaining countries and colonics which maiutaiu organ ized postal services, constitute in fact as well as in name, as its new title indicates, a uni versal union regulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse between civilized nations. Some embarrass ment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs laws of this country and the postal convention in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail. It is hoped congress will be able to devise some means remedying the difficulties which have thus been created so as to do jus tice to all involved. - THE tT. S. COURTS. The business of the supreme court, aud of the circuit courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such au extent . during the past year that additional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay of justice, aud the possible opposition to suitors which is thus occasioned. The annual report of the attorney geueral and the remedy suggested i earnestly urged for congressional action. The creation of additional circuit judges as pro posed would afford a complete remedy aud would involve au expense at the present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000. a year. v THE 

INDIAN TROUBLES. The annual reports of the secretary of the interior and ot the commissioner of Indian attain, presents an elaborate account of the present condition of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of the public service which min isters to their interests. While the conduct of the Indians generally has been orderly and their relations with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local disturb aces have oc curred which were deplorable in their charac ter ; : but remained, happily, confined to a comparatively small number of Indians. The discontent among the Bannock which led first to some act of violence on the part of omo members of tribes, and finally to tbt outbreak, appears to have ; been caused by an insufficiency of food on their reservation, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations made by congress to the wants of the Indians at a time when the Indians were preventc4 from sup plying the deficiency by. hunting. After an arduous pursuit by tins troops of the Uuited States aud several engagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjeetiou, and the larger part of them surrendered themselves as prisoners. . In this connection I desire to call tttention to the recommendation by the secretary of the interior that a sufficient tund be placed at the disposal of the executive, to be used with proper accountability, at discretion, iu sudden emergencies of the Indian service. The other case of disturbance was that of a baud of Northern Cheyeunee, who suddenly left their reservation in Indian Territory and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Ne braska in the direction of their old hunting grounds, committing murders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompany ing the report of the secretary of the interior it appears that this disorderly band was as fully supplied with the necessaries of life as 4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on the reservation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a reckless aud mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have surren dered to the military authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that when some had taken ref uge in the camp of the Bed Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the Uuited States, thus giving new proof of their loyal spirit. Alarming rumors to the contraray notwith standing, they have uniformly shown ever siuce the wishes they expressed at the couucil of September, 1S77, had been complied with Both the secretary of the interior and the sec. retary of war unite in the recommendations that provision be made by Cougress for the or ganization of a corps of Indian auxiliaries, to be under the control of the army and to be used for the purpose of keeping Indians on their reservations and preventing or repress ing disturbances on their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Iudiau cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indians by with drawing from it a number of youna men and giving them congenial employment under the government. It being a matter of experience that the Indians in our service, almost with out exception, are faithful in the performance of duties assigned to them, such uu organiza tion wonld materially aid the army in the ac complishment of a task for which! its numer ical strength is sometimes found insufficient. But while the employment of a force for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and thut wise prepar ations should be made to that end, ! greater re liance must be placed ou humane aud civiliz ing agencies for the ultimate solution of what is called - , THE 

"INDIAN PROBLEM." V It may be very difficult, and require much patient efiort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized life; but experience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes who are now quiet and or derly and self-supporting were ouce as savage as any that at present roam the plains or ou the mountains of the far west, ami were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up 'to the level of the white populatiou of the United States, but we should not forget that they are the aborigines of the country, aud called the soil their own which on our people have grown rich, powerful and happy. . We owe is to them as a moral duty to help them in attaining at least that degree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It is not only our duty but it is also our interest to do so. Inniau8 who have become agriculturalists or herdsmen, aud feel an iuterest in property, will henceforth cease to be a warlike and dis turbing ilement. It is also a well authenti-' cated tact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their childreu are at school, and 1 am gratified to know from expressions of Indians themselves, and from many concur ring reports, that there is a steadily increas ing desire even among Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their chil dren educated. I invite attention to the re ports of the secretary ot the interior and the commissioner of Indian affairs touching the experiment recently inaugurated in taking 50 Indian children, boys and girls, from differ ent tribes to the Hampton Normal Agricul tural Institute in Virginia, where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in agricultural and other useful work, to be return wl to their tribes after the com pleted course, as interpreters, instructors and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with the selection of those children might have had thousands of youngludians sent with him had it been possible to make pro vision for them. I agree with the secretary of the interior in saying that the result; of this interesting experiment, if favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advancement of civilization among the Indians. j THE CHANGE IN THE INDIAN SERVfiTE. The question whether a change in coiitml of the Indian service should be made was at iast session of Congress referred to a committee for inquiry and report Without desiring to an ticipate that report I venture to express a hope that in the decision of bo important a question, the views expressed above may not be lost sig.ht of, and that the decision,! what ever it may be will arrest the further; agita tion of this subject,' such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the ser vice as well as on the Indians themselves. THE HOT 8PRIHG3 COMMISSION. - Iu the enrollment of the bill making appro priations for sundry civil expenses at the , last session of Congress, that , portion which 'pro vided for the continuation of trie Hot Springs commission was omitted. As the commission had completed the work of taking testi mony on many conflicting claims, the sus pension of their labors before determining the rights of claimants threatened for a time to embarrass the interest not only -of the gov ernment but also of a large number of citi zens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order! to prevent serious difficulties which were appre hended, at solicitation of many leading citi zens of Hot Springs and others interested in the welfare of the town, the secretary of the interior was authorized to request the commis sion to take charge of the records of their pro ceedings and to perform such work as could properly be done by them under such circum stance to facilitate the future adjudication of claims at an early date, aud to preserve the status of claimants until their rights should be finally determined. Tho late com missioners complied with that request and report that the testimouy in all the cases has been written out and so arranged as to facili tate an'early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that requisite au thority be given at as early, a day in the ses sion as possible,' and that fair compenxion be allowed the late commissioners for expense incurred and the labor performed by them since the 20th of Juue last i TB? PBESEBVATION Or TIMHER OJC ' PCBLIO I Invite the attention of congress to the re commendation made fey the Secretary oi the Interior witn regard to the preservation of tim ber on public lands of the United Slates. Tae protection of publie property is one of the first duties of government. The Department of the Interior should therefore be enabled by suffi cient appropriations to enforce tbe laws iu that respect; but this matter appears still more Im portant as a question of public economy. Rapid reduction of our forests Is an evil fraught wiut the gravexl consequences, especially In moun tuioous districts, where tbe rocky (-lopes once denuded of their trees, will remain so for ever. The injury once dona cannot be re paired. I fully concur with the eecreary of sue inienur iu me opinion rnat tor mis rea son legisliition touching tbe public ifuobr in tbe mountainous States aod Territories of the West should be especially well considered, and that existing laws iu which the destruction ot forests is not femoiently guarded against should be speedily modified. A general law concerning this important iubj-ct appears to me to be matter of ujgeni, public necessity. AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. " From tbe organization of the kovernment, the importance of encouraging, by all possi ole mean, the lncrea of our agricultural pro ductions, has been nc)tnowlPda-ed and urged upon the attention of eongreva aid the people hm tiie surest aud eastettt means of increasing our NUbstKUtial and enduring prosperity. The words of Washington ar as applicable Uvdy as when In bis eighth annual message be said: "It Is not to tie doubled, tha. with refereute either to individual or nto.1 nal welfare, agrl , culture is of pnmry Importance.. In propor tion as nations advance in population and oilier circumstances j maturity, that truth becomes more apparent and renders tbe cult i vation of the soil more and more un object of puoiie pa louuge. insumuous ior promoting It grow up supported by the put. lie. purse, and to wLat object can 11. be dedicated with greater propriety. Among the means whico nave been , employed to 'his end none have been attended with 'greater success ihan the establishment of boards, composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffu sing information, aud enabled by premiums and small pecuniary ids. to encourage and as sist a spirit of discovery afad Improvement This spec es of establishment is contributing doubly to the inciease and improvement by t-liniuialing u enterprise and experiment, and by iirawn g to a common center the resuim, everywhere, cf Individual skill and observa tion, aud tpreadimr luern theue over the whole nation. Experience accordingly hath tihown that they are very cheap lnliunieiiuof tin niense national beuehl." . The gwat preponder ance of tbe agricultural over any other interest in tbe United .stu es entitles it to all tbe con sideration claimed for it by Washington. About oiie-hulf of the population of tbe United states are engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the United Htates for tbe year ls?8 is estimated at three thousand millions of d liars. The expense of agiicuitural products for tbe year li77, as ap pear from the report of the bureau of statis tics, are $o'2t,0 0,000. Tbe great extent ot our country, with Its divetsity of soil snd climate enables a to produce within our borders and by ourow u labor not only the necessaries, but iuiM-t of the luxuries, that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet notwithstanding our advantages of soil, ciimute aud Intercommuni cation, it appears ironi the statistical state ments in the report of tbe Commissioner of Ag riculture that we import annually front for eign luiidM many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the prtctice of advanced agriculture which can ouiy be answered by experiments, olten costly und sometimes fruit ess, which are be yond the means oi private individuals, and are a just ana oroper charge oi tbe wnoie nation, r or the tx netit of the nation it is goud policy, espeelallj , in times of depression and uncer tainty iu other business pun-nits, with a vast area of uncultivated and hence unproductive territory, to wL-ely open homestead settle ments uu l to encourage, in eveiy proper and legitimate means, tbe occupation and tillage of the soil. The eilurtsof the dt par.meut of ag riculture to stimulate, and introduce uew agri cultural industries; to improve the quality Mild lncre ise tbe quantity of our products; to determine tne value of old, or establish the importance of new modes of culture, are worthy of your ct ret u I and favorable consideration, and Assistance by such appropriations of money aid enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by lhe present favorauie condition for tiie growth and rapid develop ment of this iuiDOfiant interest THE 

TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. The abuse of animats In transit is widely -attracting public attention. A national conven t ou of societies specially interested in the sub ject has recently met at Baltimore, and the facts developed bo-h in regard lo cruelties to animals, and the effect of such cruelties upon Hie public health, now set ill to demand the careful consideration of congress, and the en act meat of more efficient laws lor the prevent tion of these abuses, POPULAR EDUCATION. The report of the Commissioner of the Bnr eaaof Kducation shows h very gratifying pro gress of tne won try in all laierest committed to the care of ibis important office. The re port is especially encouraging with respect to the extension of advantages of the common school system in tbe seclnms of tbe country where ttie general enjoyment of the privi leges Is not yet attained. T education more than to all o- her agencies are we to look as a source for advancement of tbe people iu I be requisite knowledge and appreciation of their riunut and respontdbiiiues as citizens, aod I desire to repeat tue suggestion contained tu my former message in behalf of tue enact meDl of t appropriate measures by congress for tlin purpose of suppiemt nilng with national and local systems of education in tbe several states, and for adequate accommodation of the gieat I Unary whicu is overgrowing the capa city of the rooms now occupied. Rooms at the carl tol should be provided without fur ther deiay. This invaluable collection of books, mtnUFcripts and illustrative art has grown to such proporiionx in connection with the copyrigiit system of tne country as to de mand (he prompt and careful attention of congress to save it from injury in lis present crowded and Insufficient quarters. As this library is national in its character, ana must from the natute ot the cas increase even more rapidly iu the future ihan in the past It cannot be doubleu that tbe people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve and enlarge iisuseiullness. THK SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE. Tbe appeal of the agents of the Hmithsonian institute lor means to organize, exhibit and make available for public beueht lhe articles now stored away belonging to tbe national museum. I heartily recommend It to your consideration. , THE DISTRICT OF CO UHBIA. The attention ol congress is again invited to the condition of tne river front of the city of Washington. It Is a matter of vital Impor tance to tbH health of the residents of (he national capltoi, both temporary and peima nent, that the low lands in front ot tne city, now subject to tidal oveiflow, should he re claimed. In their present condition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a dangerous source of malarial poison. The reclamation will improve tbe navigation of ihe river by restricting and consequently deepening its channel, ami 1 also of impor tance' when considered in connection with tbe extension ol the public ground and the enlargement ot the park west and sou h of the Wa-hicgton monument. Tue report ol the board of survey heretofore ordered by act of congress on lmprovem ntof tbeharbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respectfully commended to consideration. The report of tne commissioners oi me uistricioi uoiuraoia presents a detailed statement of the affairs of the district, relative to expenditures by the United Mate and the dtstrlct ror local pur poses, as contrasted, showing that Ihe expen ditures by the people of Ihe olslriet greatly exceed tnose of the general government. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for requisite repairs of detective pavements &ad sewers of tbe city, which 1 work of im media'e necessity. And Iu tbe same connec tion a ptan 1 presented for permanent land ing of iheou islanding securities of the dlsirlcf Tiie ten.-volent, reiorin and penal institutions of tue district are all entitled to the favorable attention of congress. The reiorin school needs aodiilonal buildings aod teachers. Ap propriations which will place all these Insti tutions in a condition to become models of useluilness and beneficieoce will be legarded ai lioertllty wisely bestowed. The commis sioners, with evident Justice, request attention to the discrimination made by congress against the district in the donation of land for tbe suppoit of tbe public ssuooli. I ask that the same liberality that has been shown to the inhabitant ot tbe various stales Jd terri tories of ihe United Stales be extended to the Llitrtct of Columbia. abe commissioner also invite attention to the damage Inflicted upon public and private iulerests uy the present location ot the de pots and switching Itacks ol the several rail loads entering ihe city, and ask for legislation looking to their removal. Tue recommenda tions and suggestlona contained la the-rLort 1 trust will receive the careful consideration of congress. - i-uincieut time has perhaps not elapsed slnre the reorganisation of the government of the district under tbe recent legislation of congress for t he expresAiuu of a eourideut oplulon a to its sui cc.ssiut occupation. Tue practical result already attained sue so satisfactory that the friendsof the new government may well urge upon co -g i ess the wi-doiu of its continuaBoe with essential modi ncatlon, oulii by aciual experience its advantages and defects may be more fuiiy ascertained.
