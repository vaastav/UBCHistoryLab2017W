Winona, Minn.: In eonseipience of the outbreak of stnalipox in this city the local board of health has, in accordance with the wishes ot lr. HracUen, secretary of the .state board «»f health, issued orders to the •iroet ear company to stop its cars at Lib erty Street. the western boundary of the infected district, in order to prevent the residents ot that district, from riding on thecals and thus spreading tlrj disease. The Washington and Kosciusko schools were also ordered closed for the present, as were also two steam laundries. The closing of the laundries has inconvenienced a great many people, and has caused not a little denunciation of the board of health, as the local physicians are unable to agree whether the disease is really smallpox. As yet there have been no deaths from the disease, although there are more than 400 cases. The doctors think they have the epidemic well in hand now and that the worst is over.

San Francisco: Thirteen people were killed and fully fifty badly injured by the collapse of the roor of the Pacific Glass Works on Fifteenth Street Thanksgiving Day while it was crowded with men and boys watching a football game on the field adjoining. About seventy-five people fell through the roof upon the redhot furnaces and glass vats below. All were horribly burned, and it is feared that in addition to the thirteen deaths already reported there will be several more. Two hundred men and boys had gath ered on the roof of the glass works to ob tain a free view of the football game be tween Lclaud Stanford and University of California. About twenty minutes after tiie game had commenced there was a crash plainly audible from the football grounds, and a portion of tliecrowd on the roof went down. The fires in the furnaces had been started for the first time Thanksgiving Day and the vats Were full of liquid glass. It was upon those that the victims fell. Some were instantly killed and others wei'i slowly roasted to death. The few who missed the furnaces rolled off and together with the workmen of the glass works I saved the lives of many who lay tincon scions, by pulling them away from their horrible resting place. Might y-t wo persons, more or less injured were, taken to the various hospitals or re mo\ed to their homes.

WEEK'S HAPPENINGS SOUTH DAKOTA EVENTS IN CONDENSED FORM. Question llnsj Arisen tn Yankton and Other Counties Concerning the Eligibility of County School Superintendent^— Other Items. A controversy has been raised in Yank ton County concerning the eligibility or l'\ Williams, lately elected county superintendent on the Republican ticket. Ilis opponents raise the point that he has had no state certificate for one year prior to iiis election, as required by law. The records ot the state superintendent show Williams was granted a certificate on June Hi, 1000. This would make him short of the necessary time required by law, but the department of education holds that lie is still not disqualified, as the law permits the holder of a first grade certificate to be county superintendent of schools. A great (leal of controversy has arisen in the stale relating to the eligibility of county superintendents under this provision of tiie statute, and the case of Mrs. Kings bury. wife of tiie late Superintendent Kingsbury of Mct.'ook County, who de sired to be appointed al'Ler the death or her husband, was submitted to Attorney Gen eral l'yle lor an opinion in I'ebinary, IS'.KI. He held the law unconstitutional, because it-sought to establish qualifications for a county superintendent- in addition to those mentioned in the constitution of the slate, and that a county superintendent need only to be an elector. Miss Lucena Triss- I ler of Pennington County, who was re- 1 cently defeated for superintendent, threat ens to bring suit against her .successful op ponent on the ground of ineligibility under 1 the statute, in which event the supreme, court will in all probability pass upon the constitutionality of the law.

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT State's Revenues from Leases and Ileal Estate Sales. Laud Commissioner Eastman lias about completed Ills biennial report for the pe riod ending June SO, 1900, in which he shows the work which is being done toward building up a fund for the benefit of the common schools and various educational institutions of the state. After a general review as to the methods of handling the state funds, he gives a few statements in his letterof transmittal, call ing attention to the tabulated work in the body of the report, which gives in full just what is being done by the oflice and which is of interest generally, as are all the de partments of state which have to do with the revenues. The letter shows that the amount of the permanent school fund now held by the slate, which has been received from vari ous sources, is $3,372,1)2(1, 011 which tiie state is drawing interest for the benefits of the schools. The amount which the de partment has paid toward the support of the common schools of the state since 181)0 is $1,377,747. The state was granted 2.150.iSt acres of common school lands, which docs not in clude tiie sections tn reservations granted for such purpose. Attention is called to the fact that with the additional $1,200 for clerk hire anil $-100 for expenses granted the department by the last legislature, it has been able to se cure topographical records of the state lands in a number of counties, and also to keep a man in the field looking after tres passers, securing by this lease funds from many tracts winch have been used for years without any revenue to tiie state, in which the new deputy has many times paid the additional cost to the state. A still greater appropriation is asked of the coin ing legislature to further carry on this work. Attention is further called to the fact that the state owns a number of largt tracts of laud which it is hard to lease on account of lack of water, and especial at tention is called to a tract of 58.720 acres iu Kail Uiver County, for which an appro priation is asked to sink an artesian well, taking tlm position .that the rental would soon pay any such expense and bring the state a profit from property which is now bringing nothing. Out of 23S.KI3 acres of state lauds sold only 40 acres have come hack to the. state by the failure of the purchaser to make the required payment*. L'ader tiie provisions of the act allow ing the sale of dead and down limber on state lands, such timber has been disposed of to the amount of $1,404.50, most of this being in Lawrence County.

The number ot manufacturing establishments reported' by the present census is C3r,lHJl), as against 350,000 iu 1890, but this number will have to be cut down about So,000 because of the excessive zeal of the enum erators. Perhaps they were actuated also by a desire to increase their compensa tion. An enumerator receives 25 centa for every manufacturing establishment reported, aud since the returns came in a good deal of "padding" has been dis covered^For example, when two or nim ir kinds of articles were manufactured by the same person or company under 1 same roof, some of the thrifty enumera tors reported two factories and made out two schedules, thus doubling the number of establishments and their own pay. Klncksmith shops and repair shops mi big farms and plantations were reported as manufactories, while eagerness to in crease their pay and make a favoraole report caused many enumerators to ex aggerate. A strong effort •will be made at 1 in­ coming session of Congress to pass a mil placing the consular department upon a civil service basis, with a longer tenure of oflice than at present prevails in tuts much-neglected branch of federal employ ment. Several bills are pending beiore the foreign relations and affairs commit tee, of the House aud Senate designed to reorganize tlie consular service, aud a majority of the committee members are in favor of reporting the Senate* biil, which combines the best features. Never theless there is powerful enmity toward any legislation affecting the consular vice. It strikes at the root of what si:l: remains of federal patronage, and politi cians of both branches of Congress are not easily convinced that the best inter ests of the country are preserved abr a! by placing consular agents subject to civil service laws, protected thereby as long 11s tlie.v observe their duties and not lia ble to dismissal at the advent of every new administration. The ceremonies incident 10 the inau guration of William McKinley and T.i.'ii dore Itoosevelt as President and ice- President of the United States next March are to be the most imposing of any ever seen iu tlie national capital, i'lie most pronounced and spectacular feat ,re of the inauguration will bo, of course, the parade and the ball. Those who have al ready interested themselves iu the .-•.ib jeet say that efforts will be made make the parade the longest, the bigg -t nitd the greatest seen iu the United States since tlie filial grand review nf A? A -my of the Potomac. They j/ijin" to t"!.. that it will be much easier to provi.Mw. monster military p^cant now than at any other time miici'- the ciose of the Civ War. The railroad managers wiil see to. it, it is s.aij, that the lowest fares "ii re'eord wil'/ be made in that, tiie greatest number possible will be induced to witness the spectacle. At the time this is written President McKinley lias'practically completed :us annual message. The lues-age dit'. uds at length the policy of the administration ill the Philippines. It calls atteiiti 11 to the progress made iu establishing rder and good government in the island-, em phasizing the fact that military rule has been superseded by the civil authority of the Xaft commission. The message an nounces the administration's purpose of holding the islands as peruiaueat United States territory aud governing them on. the same plan as that adopted in Cuba. China comes iu for lengthy consideration* in the message, aud tlie policy ot the administration expressed iu the note to the powers of July is reiterated. This, note opposed all schctnes of territorial conquest in China. Reference is also made to the trust question with recom mendation that Congress ta'« suitable action ou the subject. The exact vote for McKinley. Hryau and other presidential candidate:) cannot be ascertained until the ovcmors of all the States have sent to the Secretary of State at Washington the results of the official count, as required by law. In or der that there may lie no errors in he returns Secretary May preparad a circu lar of instructions setting forth exactly how the compilation should be made and the form iu which ir-shouhl be recorded. These returns must be made out in dupli cate. One set is sent by mail to the State Department, the other set by messenger to the Vice-President of the United States. The latter will be opetieil iu the presence of the two houses of Congress and formally recorded aud promulgated by tellers appointed for that purpose. Statements furnished by the Treasur* Department show that iu tlie period froiii June 12, 1898, to .Tune :0, 1!HK), the war revenue act produced .$ii 11.144,288.
