Official returns from all but two counties in the State of New York, with unofficial returns from those, give a Republican plurality of 37, 616. The full Republic in vote was 389,676 Democratic,352,060 Green back, 71,020 Prohibition, 3,533. The Boston Herald thinks that the party which makes the fewest blunders in the next two years will win in 1880, and the St. Paul Globe adds: "If this is true, we very much fear that the Democracy will come out at the small end of the horn, for the talent for blundering they dis play approaches the marvelous." Gen. M. D. Flower seems to have no opposition as a candidate for re election as chief clerk of the House. St. Paul Dispatch. We are glad to note that General Flower's prospect of a re-election is so good. He made a faithful andef ficient officer last winter, and the members of the next House could not make a better choice. The drive-well war still rages. The organization of the Anti-Drive Well Association was perfected in St. Paul on the 29th ult., and an address has been issued to the people by a committee appointed for that purpose. There is a general cessa tion in the payment of the royalty, and it appears the people are deter mined to thoroughly test the matter in the courts before submitting to the exactions of the patentee of these wells. The Millers' Association of Wis consin at their annual meeting in Milwaukee yesterday adopted reso lutions asking the Milwaukee cham ber of commerce to establish another grade of wheat to be called No. 2 soft and requesting millers to furnish fife wheat to farmers for seed, so that the yield of hard wheat may be increased. Minnesota farmers may well take a hint from this, for too much soft wheat has been sown of late.St. Paul Dispatch. The trade dollar received the at tention of Congress on the first day of its session. Senator Beck intro duced a fbill providing that for the period of twelve months after the passage of this act the outstanding trade dollars shall be receivable as legal tender for all debts and de mands, including customs dues ow ing the United States, and said trade dollars so received shall be recoined as soon as possible into standard sil ver dollars of 412+ grains. Similar bills were also introduced in the House. In Rice Co., this State, there have been a dozen sugar mills in opera tion, and the total product from am ber cane is estimated at 30,000 gal lons. One firm in Faribault has manufactured nearly 4,000 gallons Of syrup, a fine article, unexelled, for all purposes, by the best New Or leans. A gentleman in that section, who has taken a deep interest in the subject and is willing to put in $20,- 000 towards building a refinery, has been investigating the matter with much care, and declares that the amber has more saccharine matter than the Louisiana cane. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The second annual message of President Hayes, which we print to day on third page, is a straight for waid b^iness document, briefly re viewing the operations of the sever al executive departments during the past year and making only such re commendations as the condition of the public interests demands. The most interesting portion is that in which he alludes to affairs in the South. He treats the situation with a clear preception of the crimes a gainst personal freedom and the risht of suffrage committed by the white leaders in the South and takes firm ground in favor of enforcing the laws, and punishing all offend ers. As a whole the message is pro nounced an admirable state paper, and we commend it to all readers who wish to be well informed as r gar4s our public matters. |j| A
