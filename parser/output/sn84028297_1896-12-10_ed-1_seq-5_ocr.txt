Mr. Ed.: Please allow ine space in your columns to correct a few errors in an article of your last week's issue, headed "White Caps." In the first place we deny the assertion of Mr, W. being a tramp, as he came here to work for a farmer as respectable a citizen as we have in Monroe, town ship, the writer having been acquaint ed with him after working about a year in this neighborhood. He did make his home with the family of the widow, a family of grown up chil dren, the youngest a girl of 12 years. The husband being dead 7 years in stead of 2 as was stated in the article. Mr. W. came to the hegUhorliood about 3 years ago from Pickaway Co., leaving a mother, brother and sev eral halfbrothers and sisters, who un doubtedly would be pained to hear of their brother and son being called a tramp. He is industrious, of no bad habits, and is . as you stated harmless. He is also a member of the K. of P. lodge. Everything was agreeable with him and the children knowing that he and their mother were so called "good friends," the older ones saying if their mother wanted to get married they would not object to him. Aboit three or four months ago the home place was of fered for sale and the children be came dissatisfied, thinking they were not going to get their share. Since then there has been dissatisfaction but no outward appearance until November 20th, when the White Caps put in appearance between the hours of 0 and 7 p. m. just after they had come home from her, (Mrs. H's.) sister's, 3 of her children being at home. Such treatment would do for a barbarous country but we live in a civilized country where law and or der are maintained, life and property are protected, and we, as citizens do not tolerate such conduct and think the matter should be investigated and the guilty parties brought to justice. - X. .

I al ways recommened it, and have fre quently administered it to my guests in the hotel, and in every case it has proven itself worthy of unqualified endorsement. For sale by D. J.

A Writer' Beasons For Thinking " Visit ing" Intolerable. Of what earthly nse is "company?" Yon probably see your neighbors once a week, meeting them on the public high ways, and if you nod pleasantly and speak a word or two of the weather and of the health of the family, has not ev erything been done that our necessities require or formality can reasonably de mand? If we have business or need in formation that others can give us, go and ask of them. Be brief, but to the point, and, leaving with what is de sired, carry away also their blessing. To go to another's house, to request of its inmates, one or all, to sit for half an hour or longer and listen to your plati tudes, and coming away lie to them about a pleasant call, is intolerable. Vet there are thousands who do this daily. . Why should I leave my occupation, be it loafing even, and give my atten tion to some man or woman who is thoughtless enough to "call?" The actuating motive never appears. Much is spoken and nothing said. ' I receive no worthy thought to profit by or in crease the probability of a beatifio eter nity. The familiar well gnawed bones of doctrine fall from the devil'B table. Usually I am forced to breathe at such a time a gossip poisoned atmosphere. This "call" is another idea of civility, and I -am compelled, it appears, to be a victim of his or her whim. If I refuse, as I have done point blank, to present myself, I am called a boor and all man ner of ugly names. Lippincott's. Strange Beginning of a Friendship. I remember the anecdote my stepfa ther, Count d'Aure, who entered La Fleche before the regulation age of 8, used to tell me. It was the first time he had left his mother, and he was some what bewildered by the roughness of his comrades, who affected the airs of old troopers. To make sure that he was not a milksop, one of them, a veteran of 12, made him lay his hand flat on the ground, stepped on it and crushed one of his fingers. This tormentor was the future General Baraguay d'Hilliers. The victim, who nearly fainted, bore it bravely! however. "And this was the beginning," my stepfather used to add half a century later,- when showing his deformed finger, "of a friendship that lasted all our lives." This happened shortly after the first empire, when Roimiu virtues were emulated, but one must not infer from this isolated fact that stoicism flourishes vigorously in the French educational system.
