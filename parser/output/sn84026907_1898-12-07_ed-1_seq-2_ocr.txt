The Lexington Dispatch Burned April 25th; rebuilt July 19,1894. G. M. HARM AN. Editor and Pub'isher. LEXINGTON, S. C., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1898. A proposition is beiDg seriously agitated, and the more it is discussed * i*'i 1 tbe more wide spreaa n r>ecomutyoj&.- i ing to the disbandment of the colored j volunteer troops in the United States army. This movement is beiDg led by conservative men who are moved so to do irrespective of party affiliation and are such a class a3 to command the respect and attention of the Ad ministration. The^onduct of these troops, especially in the South, has been anything else but^nducive to the peace and morals of the communities where they are located. They are a source of constant friction both in the field and in the camp and they have proven themselves totally unworthy to defend the honor and integrity of the country. Their benavior has been a reproach to the intelligent members of their race, and the good and respectable ele?nonf r?f fhoir *v-?!r?r is made to feel the shame and disgrace of the rerephensible condoct of their representatives in the army. These remarks, of course, are applicable odIv to the rowdies who have shown themselves incapable of controlling their passions and caDnot be taught discipline. An exchange says that the anDual report of Secretary Gage was sent to the Speaker of the House yesterday. The receipts for the fiscal year are four hundred and ninety-four millinns. three hundred and ninety three thousand dollars. The expenditures exceed this by thirty-eight miliioD, which include the military establishment. The expenses of the war were ninety-two millions, of which fifty-nine millions were for the n^vy. The receipts compared with previous years are sixty-four millions. The increase in expenses for the military > was forty-three millions and for the navy twenty-four millions. The message of President McKinley to Congress is an able paper and deals with the incidents of the Spanish-American war in a statesman like manner. As it is an important and interesting paper we will probably give the substance of it next week. Housekeepers will rejoice to learn that Arbunble Brothers, have reduced the price of refined sugars and that the other refiners will follow suit and go them one better. When trusts fall out and fight each other the public generally is benefitted. The State Legislature will meet in Columbia on the second Tuesday in January, which is the 10th day of the month. The last session of the fifty -fifth Congress assembled at Washington last Monday. Nearly all the Congressmen were in their seats. 

OBITUARY. It seems but yesterday that the gentle mother of a lovely family? TT>-i1 T? n 1 ^ir^^A ,-T, X>eiuaiiy jjuu&ki vauguujnu, 91 uuu in the pride and beauty of her womanhood. Though in her 88th year, her vitality was reluctant to diminish sustained by a vigorous constitution, a tireless activity and a wonderful love that kept her fresh and youthful. "Whoever loves is in no condition old." Vividly thrilling was the last act of her life, as she bent down and tenderly placed the sleeping little great grand child in its cradle for its Dight's repose. Just as she laid down the dear little one to rest and to awake again to the joys and sorrows of this earthly lift; so was she a few hours later to be laid down by her heavenly father on the soft and loving breast of Jesus to sleep from which none ever wake to weep, but to rejoice amid the pleasures and triumphs of the heavenly life. As the sad message of her departure from the shores of tim9 reached her children and grandchildren they hastened to her bed side where with tortured brows, tear-stained eyes and hearts of anguish they clasped her hands, aDd pressed her lips with the ^ last kisses of fond affection and long farewell. Though voiceless, her eyes met them with that quick, swift, earnest look and joyous recognition which ever comes to the pure and good in their passing hour. "While the bereaved ones were loath to resigD a joy that bad so radiantly illuminated their existence, their Christian faith sustains, sooths and upholds them in their sore affliction, knowing that the living and dead are i not lost to each other.

A cbiid piously inclined, she was confirmed early in life in St. Stephen's Evangelical Lutheran church: from which she was afterwards transferred to Providence Ev. Lutheran church, where her funeral services were held. The sermon was preached by her pastor, Rev. J. G. Graichen, in the presence of a large aDd sorrowful congrfgation of friends and relatives. Her remains were interred in the j cemetery adjoining the church, where she rests with her loved cues.

G. * Lexingtoo, S. CDec. 1,189?. ? Swansea's Doings. To the Editor of the Dispatch: The rise in cotton has brightened gome faces but to many the tidiDgs comes too late. The people of Swansea had the pleasure last week of a visit from Capt. HeDry Counts of It mo. The Captain is a representative citizen and an ornament to the agricultural profession and we gladly extended him a welcome. Frederick BackmaD, a worthy youDg farmer of our section, has gone in company with physician Dr. J. L. Johnson to Columbia to have a surgical operation performed on his case because of an enlargment on his left jaw. His friends are anxious for hi9 condition. The farmers are still putting in small grain aDd the attention paid this crop and area given it this year jpas never been equalled before. It seems like "the before war times:'' Mrs. Lila Weathersbee and Mrs. S. B. Sawyer of Norway, Orangeburg county, are visiting relatives in and around Swansea. It is said W. H. F. Hist grew eleven inches in ten hours and greatly added to his capacity in pounds also after the appearance last week of another little boarder whose name "they say" shall not be John but William Jennings Bryan Bast. D. J. Knotts has purchased of J. H. Counts of Irmo, a fine specimen of an English Berkshire pig. As I was passing a stranger yesterday on the Orangeburg road the thought crossed my mind, well surely you are the ugliest white man I ever saw, but accompanying was the conviction that such an honest, sincere face 1 seldom see. Just as he passed he commenced singing in a real sweet, .melodious tone, "We shall be like Jesus there and his beauties we &ball . share, in that home of many mansions bright and fair." Then I thought, has that poor man the power of mind reading and did he sing: for his own Dr. Rice, of the Columbia Female College, lectured here on Friday night, in the academy, on education. The lecture was given in the interest of education and was an able effort and well worthy of the illustrious teacher and educator. This scholar has given his life and energies to this absorbing question. Rev. McFarlane has gone to Rock Hill to see his sick daughter, at school there aDd will remain over j and go to the Methodist Annual Cjn- j ference at Greenwood next week. Spectator. Swansea, Dec. 3.

The story of what it will do is told in the -^following letter: "About two and a half years ago. when I was at Flat Lick. K\\." writes J. \V. Jordan. Esq.. of Corhin. Whitley Co.. Kv? "1 was taken with severe pains in the chest, alter which I begun to spit up blood and was also troubled with nightsweats. I was so short winded that I could hardly walk half a mile at once, and if I got the least bit wearied. I would have an attack of phthisic (asthma) and almost die for about two or three days. I concluded to try Br. R. V. Picrcc. and T related tnv case to him. He wrote me that I should take his ' Golden Medical Discovery." I began using it and used about six bottles. I began to see" that it was helping me. so concluded to continue its use. 1 did so and have improved both in strength and In weight. I have not had the phthisic, uor spit up any blood since last spring."

I had only went a mile when I met another man whose appearance showed very clearly that he was a laboiing man and a man of small means. The torn out button holes and the threadbare appearance of his coat intimated that many winters of service it had rendered to its owner. He had some flour sacks and a parcel of bacon in his wagon, and in his hand a little hat for probably some little bright eyed urchin at home. As he passed he was humming a tune aud when passing by I could hear in an earnest, submissive tone, "Sweet hour of prayer, may I thy * consolation share.*' Only a mile or so more and I passed a nicely dressed man of neat appearance and a fine turnout, and in a boisterous manner passed on hastily singing, "Yes my own dearly loved chicken, I'll go with you to every cotton picking."
