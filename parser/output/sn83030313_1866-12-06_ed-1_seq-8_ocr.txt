Storage of Explosive Subhtanckh?A Mat ter fob the Legislature.?The Are which occurred in Beekman street on Tu 'silay (tight', bv which two or throe police officer* were in jured, repealed tho extraordinary and alarming fact that fifty million peremodon cups were stored in the fourth story of the building. Fortunately the fire wns extinguished before it reached this mine of death. Had it not been suppressed, who can tell what disastrous conse quences to the adjoining buildings might have been? We do not know to a mathematical ccrtuinty what quantity of this explosive sub stance known as percussion powder is required in the manufacture of fifty million caps, but we can Imagine what the effect would be ir they blow up. The storage of explosive substances in the heart of the city should not be permit ted. We have cases almost every day of acci dents occurring from the combustion of petro leum, nitro glycerine and various kinds ot fireworks. At Rochester, on Tuesday, n shock ing accident occurred from the explosion of nitro glycerine: and as long aa these substances are stored in the midst of crowded cities there is positively no safety for life or prop erty. The Legislature should take thi* matter into consideration and enact such laws a* will strictly prohibit the storage of these iuflsmmu ble and explosive substances within the limit* of any city or town. Railroad Management in This State.?We publish to-d?y tome comments on railroad management ln this State which it may profit the stockholders of our roads to read. There Is, beyond doubt, grest room for improvement In the manner In whloh the affairs of snch com panies are managed. It seoms singular that a road which cams ln 1865 three times as many millions of dollars as It earned twelve years ago, and which then paid stven per cent divi dend, should not now be able to pay six per couj wittatyt borrowing money with which to dolt Many flur Som^an^8 and railroad jompanieshav* paid their original in vAstrt&t tnree or four times over. Thsre is no reason why our railroads, If managed honestly l? ft? 2?f l>e just its remunerative. The subject is worthy the attention af those interested in such uro je-iy, 1i? Mr* iutw of d#B?yeee tmufcawKli. Id tt? Hoom of 'RepraentattvM on Tuesday last there were two important propositions adopted looking to the reconstruction and restoration of the excluded Southern States. We may say they were of the highest import ance, as indicating a two-thirds rote in favor of a comprehensive reconstruction, embracing the reorganization of the States concerned from the disorganized condition in which they stood when first disarmed as members of a hos tile confederacy. The first of these propositions was in the shape of a resolution from Mr. Wentworth, of Illinois, to this effeot?that in response to the President's Message on the status of the lately insurgent States, still excluded from Congress, "the House finds in their many acts of disloyalty since its last adjournment, as well as in the recent elections in the loyal States, additional reasons for insisting on the adoption of the pending constitutional amendment before it will consider the propriety of giving such States Congressional representation." Mr. Ancona (democrat), of Pennsylvania, moved to lay this resolution on the table, and the yeas and nays being ordered, the call resulted?yeas thirty-two, nays one hundred and nineteen, whereupon the resolution was adopted without a division. It will thus be seen that nearly four-fifths of the House are in favor of adhering to the amendment as a basis of Southern resto ration. We may conclude, therefore, that as the next Congress, lately elected, is substan tially the present Congress over again, this re solution is fixed to the 4th of March, 1869, and covers the question whether the excluded States shall or shall not be admitted into the Presidential election of 18G8. This is a mutter worth considering by the unrecognized States; for it is mornlly certain that, unless their balance of power is brought into the scales, the approaching Pre?id<?D':al election will rodtllt in fthother lease of power to the dominant party, executive as well as legislative. But the second proposition to which we hnve referred aims at the cutting Out of these Southern embarrassments by tho root. It was put in the form of a resolution from Mr. Broomall, of Pennsylvania, ins^'tct ing the Committee on Territories <vo inquire into vw. ? .? ^..ting a bill pro viding Territorial governments for the several districts of country within the jurisdiction of the United States formorly occupied by the once existing States of Virginia, North Caro lina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Ala bama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, and giving to all adnlt malo inhabi tants therein, born within the limits of the United States, or duly naturalized, and not participants in the late rebellion, toll equal | political rights in such Territorial govern ! ments." This sweeping proposition was adopted yoas one huudred and seven, nays thirty seven?a vote of nearly three-fourths or the House. To be sure, (bis is a mere inquiry ordered, but the vote indicates tho opinion, snd, probably, the fixed purpose of both bouses. The bill, we expect, will in due sea son be roportcd, and from this preliminary vote we infer that, If put to the test, it can be passed over the President's veto, when it will be a law ot the land. We believe, however, that if in the meantime the excluded States, even as now organized, adopt the pending constitutional amendment and shape their local governments and Congressional elections so as to meet its conditions, they will be admitted Into Congress after the example of Tennessee. It is because of the intractable and defiant spirit manifested by the rnling politicians of the States concerned that Mr. Broomall proposes the extreme remedy of reducing them not only to the condition of Territories, but to the control of their black population. Think of (hat?a South Carolina Territorial Legislature of blacks making laws for Wade Hampton. It is between this extreme and awtol remedy and the constitntional amendment that the unreconciled States have to choose?a choice of a salivating treatment of calomel and jalap, or a little of the sweet spirits of nitre with some tincture of rhubarb. Nor can we pro mise that any very long margin of time will be allowed for a decision upon the subject We seriously entertain the opinion, nevertheless, that if South Carolina, for example, within a month or two shall adopt the amendment and frame h?*r local institutions and her elections accordingly, she will be restored as a State without being subjected to tide threatened Territorial ordeal. The warnings which we have so repeatedly given the States and people concerned are now reduced to "a fixed fact" Nothing better will be offered them than the constitutional amendment, and if It is not very soon accepted something much worse will assuredly follow. The Evacuation of Rome.?By this time the Eternal City Is freed from the presence of the foreign garrison which ha* so long vexed the sight of its inhabitants. To them the very name of n Frenchman has become odlons and synonymons with despotism. Their asptra tionn for a share in the work of regenerating Italy were defeated through the instrumentality of these foreign mercenaries. It may, there fore, be safely assumed that their departure furnished occasion for congratulations and re joicings such as have not been witnessed for ages in the city of the Osars. The question now arises, wlmt disposition is to be made of the Pope? That he can continue to wield power as a temporal prince is out of tho ques tion. Were the Italian government disposed to make an arrangement guaranteeing him ever so limited a political jurisdiction, it would he nuabln to filial its pledges. For a brigf period matters might go on in this wqj.iat the will of the people would SQOft break through all restraints. The inhabitants of the Roman States are not lpg animated by the spirit of patriotism than the rest of their countrymen. Thay will no longer tolerate being held in tho ecclesiastical bond age which beg slnglod out their condition as one of -almost hopeless shame and reproach. If the Holy Father decides to continue in Rome we may look for rioting and bloodshed. No troops that Victor Emanuel can send there will be prevailed npon to act against the popu lace. The few mercenaries in the Pope's service would be scattered like chaff in a general rising. It was only the knowledge l^t Francj tfSg their back that proteo{$d the small French force that has so long qceu piod the city against the peopls. It dSay bo that Plus annrtrlatln? these fycls will antlol pate the grim necessity that atarea him In the fhee and voluntarily betake himself with the Sacred College, to Avignon or Malta. Thin would be the wisest thing be could do. It would enlist the sympathies of the Christian world in his behalf and secure for him such a provision as would compensate him for the shadowy royalty which he now enjoys. Divested of its embarrassments he will be in finitely more respected and able to promote the interests of the Church. He will make a great mistake if he abides the issue of a struggle for the maintenance of his power. While his doing so> can in nowise alter the result, it will expose him to the odium of allowing blood to be unnecessarily shed in his behalf. The Revolutionary Movement In Ureal Britain?John Bright's Warning. When John Bright said in his speech at St. James' Hall in London, on Tuesday, that if Parliament resisted the rights of the people the movement which is now only an expression of opinion would become a great exhibition of power, he spoke the last word before the blow. That expression was probably the final warning which the British aristocracy will receive from that influential quarter. The movement of which John Bright is the leader, although ostensibly for Parliamentary reform, has a deeper and more significant purpose, and in all probability will develop itself into a total overthrow of monarchical and aristocratic rule in Great Britain. Ocourring at the time when the people of Ireland are on the eve of assert ing the right of that portion of the British empire to an independent republican govern ment, the causo of the two peoples becomes in a measure identical. The same system of landocracy, the supremacy of a Church es tablished by law, and misrepresentation in Parliament which inspires one movement gives strength to the other. The retorm question in England is not a new one. Feniunism in Ireland is not the growth of to day. It has lived and grown for centuries, from the sapling to the iowei'in^ free whose roots are in the soil of Ireland ljut whose branches are spread over every land, from Australia to the furthermost point of British North America. It has but assumed a new shape in onr time, and taken the form of a military organization, which owes its power iu a great measure to our reoent war, where its leaders wore trained on the field, fighting for republi can Institutions in America. The contagion of republicanism, if we may call it so, has been spreading for years to Ireland by agencies which it is unnecessary to recall to mind. The interchange of thought; the stories of prosper ity acquired under a system of self govern ment like ours; the vindication of free manhood brought out undor that system?all these, in fluences have been at work in Groat Britain and all over Europe. Inasmuch as the seeds have evidently not fallen upon a rock, we can not bo surprised to see the plants growing flourishingly and tho fruit ripening. The reform movement means something more than the redress of a few grievances or the accomplishment of universal suffrage. There is a general discontent underlying the agitation which has already assumed a most menacing character and may Involve the whole aristocracy in ruin, if that class persists in its stiff-nocked opposition to the popular wilL John Bright's language at the London meeting was a threat, and that, too, baoked by the whole masses of the English people and echoed by the murmurs of incipient insurrec tion in Ireland. It can hardly be supposed that while the Fenians are demanding an inde pendent Irish republic they would objeot to a united republic of Great Britain and Ireland, because the ovils of which they oomplalu? namely, the ascendancy of the aristooratio landowners, the Established Church, whioh has to bo supported by a people who reject Its doctrines, and the supremacy of the British crown, to which they have never voluntarily submitted?would all be removed if the revo lutionary reform movement in England were to culminate in the overthrow of monarchical power. In view of these faots we can hardly separate the interests of Bright's agitation and the Fenian movement in Ireland. There is a joint Bignificancy in them whioh oannot be mis taken. The American flag, carried by Bright's reformers at the grest procession on Monday, was the type of republicanism; the music of the "Wearing of the Green," to which they mai chcd, was the representative of tho Fenian scmliment in the gathering. We tako all those signs nod demonstrations to mean that there is danger to aristocratio rule in Grqat Britain in John Bright's warning. A Personal Annovancb.?Some partly, pro bably connected with Homo bogus news specu lation, are now in the habit of sending to our office late at night proof sheets filled with items of stale news taken from the Herald and other journals of the preceding day. This puts us to the unneconsnry trouble of looking over a batch ot bogus teVgr 'us. It is an annoyance, und we hope the parties with whom it originates will put a stop to it. The u4BMk. Boutwell and the Arrest or Slrratt.?Tho explnnat'on made by Mr. Bout well In the House of Representatives on Tues day of his remarks in the republican caucus, in regard to the case of Rurratt, does not relieve him from the imputation of having sought to give currency to a most malicious and unfounded charge against the President Thero is not a radical in either House, no matter how fanatical, who attaches the least credence to it As to the formal inquiry threatened, the thing is too absurd to be per severed hi. Its only effect would be to cover all concerned with ridicule. Let us just look at the facts of the case as they stand, divested ot their nnfltir coloring. It was in the col umns of the Herald and through the mediun) of a cable despatch that the first announce ment was made of the attempt to capture luresjL If such accurate knowled|e existed in the State Department as to his movements so far back as May last, as Mr. Boutwell asserts, we need scarcely say that through some of our active correspondents abroad the readers of the Herald waald have had the information as soon as the De partment 3nt assuming tha tact to be so, is that a reason for founding npon It so foul an imputation against the Preeidsnt and the Secretary of 8tate, who !e equally Involved in the ohargef Do Mr. Boutwell and those abetting Urn in this shaq*fyl proceeding suppose that calumny oan, eve* temporarily nfomote their ohjeeta! . Every one knows the difloultlee a tier dine the arrest of eeonpeA orimlnals on a foreign Boil, more sepsoially where no extradition treaty exists. In the eaae of Sorratt these obstacle* were increased by the aid and sympathy which so many who are hostile to this country were ready to afford bim. The State Department may have been acquainted with the fact that he had left the country at the period stated; but it by no means follows that it had succeeded in tracking him through his various disguises and places of reftige until it located him in Rome. One thing we are satisfied of, and that is, that he was pounced upon as soon as there was a reasonable probability of his capture being effected. Until then the agents of the Depart ment were compelled to proceed with as much caution and reserve as possible. As it was the criminal was very near making bis escape. The distortion of facts so simple into a charge | of complicity against the President is one of the most lamentable phases of our present transition state. Nothing seems too wild or extravagant for the imagination of political partisans to conjure up as a means of damag ing an opponent The employment of calum nies eo reckless is at all times indefensible, but as used towards the Executive they should bo scouted with indignant reprobation. The llerald'a Mysterious Influence Over Mundane Affairs. The mysterious influence of the Herald is beginning to pass into a proverb. In small things or great, politics or theatricals, states manship or yachting, this influence is always perceptible and always aggravating to our contemporaries. These philosophers are ap parently very anxious to edit the Herald for us. Thoy kindly tell us what we ougljt to &ay, what side we ought to lake, w^i party or per son we flight to support. Very much an noyed at discovering that we do not follow their advice, thoy ^e sti|J mutuant when they find that we nne out right after all. They told us it wo were nf taken iu think ing Grant a great general, and assured us that McClellan the real hero of the war; but Grant fought pn :n own way and con quered, whiio McCielian fizzled out! fhoy up braided us for predicting President Lincoln's re-election ; but when the votes were counted our prediction was verified. They bitterly de nounced us for suggesting the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery; but that amendment is now part of the supreme law of the land. They opposed the new constitutional amendmenf now pending ; but we revived that moasure as a basis of restoration, and the whole North has emphatically endorsed it They wanted us to sustain Hoffman for Gover nor, assuring us that he would certainly be elected ; but we thought and said otherwise, and Hoffman was defeated. They swore that Miles O'Reilly never could be cfepaen Register; but oaths went for nothing, and Miles holds the office. Such are a few instances of the mysterious infinencp of the Herald, according to these philosophers. The election of Richard B. Connolly to the Comptroller8hip is another case in point The political managers had apparently made np their minds not to nominate this modern Dlek Wbittington, as Oakoy Hall calls him. Every body informed us that the "ring" would cor tainly stick to Brennan, no matter how many cards of resignation or withdrawal might be written, and everybody argued that we would have to go for blarneying Mike Connolly in order to break the "ring." That seemed to be a pretty good argument; but unfortunately we upset it by hinting that Judge Barnard could smash the "ring" as well as Mike Connolly, and would be altogether a more acceptable candidate. The so-called reformers would not accept Barnard, because be was too good for the place, and the Hrrald would not endorse Mike Connolly beoaos* he was too bad for the place. After a time, however, It beoame evi dent (hat the mysterious influence of the Herald had been at work onoe more, and even the most obtua* politicians perceived that Bren nan was really out of the race. Then Dick Con nolly, who has been slipping and sliding from one thing to another ever sinoe he landed with his bundle, fresh-from Ireland, In 1826, sud denly slipped into the regular demooratio nomination. This astonished the wiseacres, who at once declared that he was nominated to be dereated; that he would be oheated and swindled; that Justice Joe Dowllng was going to carry the Sixth ward for Kelly, and that Dick was sold oat all arottnd. Again the mysterious influence of the IIerat.d wns quietly exorcised, and the cheating ceased or was ineffectual. The result Is the sneers* of the best of the three candidates, in spite of Kelly's republican strength, Mike Connolly's Foniau ism and everybody's prophecy that the Herald would be wrong lor once. By-und-by it will be distinctly understood in ail circles that the Herald is never wrong. More infallible than the Tope, with whom we are compelled to find fault occasionally, we move in a mysterious way our w iders to perform; but we are sure to come on , ?ht at the end and modestly de servo tho envious plaudits of our baffled C0D. temporary s ml mistaken advisors. A Sensible Movement in the United States Senate.?The Senate very properly refused on' Tuesday to take up the bill passed so hur riedly by the House, repealing that soction of the confiscation act which gives the President power to grant a general amnesty to those lately engaged In rebellion against the govern ment ol the United States. Mr. Fesaenden, who led off in opposition to this hasty legisla tion, refused to express any opinion on the morlts of the bill in question, but stated that he objected to the passage of such an import ant measure until it had been duly considered in committee. The motion to take up the bill was lost only by a tie vote; bnt it is to be hoped that the hint will not be disregarded by the Hotiae, but wjll induce them to recognise tEe Set tiiat^ie Congress of the United States is something more than a mere caucns of vio lent and vindictive partisans. Ths Start roa ran Yacht Race.?The steamer Island Queen has been chartered by the New York Yacht Club to convey the mem bers and their guests down the bay to witnesa the start for the great Atlantic yacht race next Tuesday. The soene will undoubtedly be most picturesque; for all the vessels in the harbor will display their colors, the bay will be crowded with yachts, steamboats and excur sion parties, and the fk re well will be i.ost hearty and unanimous.

Ia the House of Representatives on Tuesday Mr. Darling, of New York, Introduced a bill for the election of a delegate to Oongreas for the District of Colombia. The bQl, which was read twice and referred to the Committee for i be District, provides that all male persons twenty-one years old, clticens of the United States and resident one year in the Distriot, shall vote at the election. Ge n'est que le premier pas qui eotde, and this is the first step towards impartial suffrage. There is no telling to what remote consequences It may lead in the progressive future. It is eminently fit and proper as well as perfectly fair and constitutional that this step should be taken first in the District of Columbia; for there can arise no dispute as to the exclusive juris diction which, according to the express terms of the constitution, Congress possesses over this tract of territory. Here, under the direct eye and hand of Congress, and also under the most favorable conditions, the experiment can be Immediately, fully and ftirly tried of unl-^ versal suffrage and of the territorial jurisdic tion whioh so many Congressmen seem eager to extend over the lately Insurgent States. The claims of the District of Columbia to the territorial right of representation by a dele gate in the lower house are, to say the loast, equal to thoso of any other terri tory. In numbers and wealth and direct interest in the national welfare its population might assert precedence over many a more vast, but comparatively unpeopled tract, which has nevertheless been raised to the dig nity and privileges of representation in Con gress. And the impulse which such a political elevation could not iail to give the inhabitants of the District along evory line of their ad vancing prosperity would be felt not onlv therb, hut throughout thfi UttJOti. itself would become more truly metropolitan than ever?a city not only of magnificent dis tances, but of magnificent advantages of every kind?a desirable permanent residence for gitizena fpnj all parts of the country. The native born citizen of the Distriot would no longer feel condemned, as it were, to an infe rior political status, his pride in his birth place would be stimulated and he would gaze with new exultation at tho dome of the Capitol when he and his fellow-citizens should be rep resented in Congress by a delegate of their own election. Besides the political benefits which would accrue to the District from the bill proposed by Mr. Darling, other Inestimable social and material benefits would be added. The recent rapid growth of population would increase, the rising value of real estate would be en hanced, public and private buildings would be multiplied, the influence of the colleges at Washington and Georgetown would be quick ened and new churches and school houses would be erected. The great progress which has been made since 1857, when only about one half of the white children in the District were receiving school education, would be ac celerated and the experiment of educating col ored children might be tried on a scale of na tional importance. Finally, when the District of Columbia shall have a delegate of its own in Congress, Senator Sumner may be relieved (to the relief of not a few citizens of the Dis trict) from his self-appointed task of aoting as a volunteer delegate in its behalf. Perhaps he will then have more timo to attend to his own constituents in Massachusetts. Ex-Uoverner Eyre nod the Jamaica Com. mlttec. The leading journals of England are still occupied with discussions on the conduot of Governor Eyre and the probability or im probability of his being brought ultimately to trial. Public sentiment on the subject seems as much divided as ever. The muscular Chris tians, as a rule, and the groat body of tho tory party unite in regarding Mr. Eyre as a model governor, and therefore as a much injured man ; whereas the people generally, including all those in every class who aro afflicted with what the first Napoleon was wont to call "mis taken humanity," see In him only the incarna tion of cruelty and an open and undisguised enemy of public liberty. The truth, perhaps, is to be found midway between these two ex tremes. Mr. Eyre, we believe, is neither so bad as his foes nor so good as his friends would mak ? h in. tic was called upon to act, and ta act with vigor, in circumstances of peculiar difficulty. It is scarcely fair to apply the or dinary laws of conduct to the actions of respon sible rulers in times of great public excitement In Mich persons on such occaslous certain dis cre'ionary powers must be supposed to be lodged. The good man and the bad man are equally liable to give way to some immediate and powerful impulse. Time and tho result alone can determine whether those discretion ary powers have been abused and what has been the real character of the action. We have no hesitation in saying that if the rising in Ja maica had been less promptly suppressed and the blood of a few thousand whites had been shed, the cruelty and judicial murder laid to the charge of Mr. Eyre would never have been beard of. At the same time much interest attaches to this expeoted trial. Such scenes are less familiar to the world now than of old. In the palmy days of the ancient Roman republic trials of this kind were by no means uncom mon. and some of the most magnificent specta cle# which the City of the Seven 11111# ever presented were witnessed on those occasions. The only event In modern times with whiob tbey may be compared is the celebrated trial of Warren Hastings, which took place amid circumstanoes of pomp and splendor snob as perhaps England alone at that time of all the nations of the earth conld present?a trial which Macaulay has embalmed in imperish able language, and of which Hastings himself said that one generation had witnessed Its commencement and another generation wit nessed its close. We do not for a moment mean to compare the ex-Governor of Jamaica with the lllnstrions Proconsul of India. Thsre was a magnificence about Hastings, small in stature as he was?a magnificence about his virtues as well as bis vices, to which Mr. Eyre osa never pretend. We have no expectation that the trial, If It should take place, will ap proach that of Hastings, slther in Interest br attractiveness. Bat In these times of coia$era tlvs dulness It will have In it the qltment of novelty, and it is not impossible Utat It amy tend to thro* light on some Important and difficult questions.
