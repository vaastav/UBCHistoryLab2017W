Good as Far as They Go but 8uggests Supple mental Legislation—For Fed era I Corporation Law.^ Washington, Dec. 6.—President Taft's annual message, which was read in both houses of congress today, dealt exclusively with the anti-trust statute, The full text of the message 'is as foli lows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatlves: This message is the first •, of several which I shall send to con» gross during the interval between tha opening of its regular session and its adjournment for the Christmas holi days. The amount of Information to be communicated as to the operations of ythe government, the number of lmpor. tant subjects calling for comment by the executive, and the transmission to congress of exhaustive reports by spe clal commissions, make it Impossible to include in one message of a reason, able length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the atten tion of the national legislature at its first regular session.- The Anti-Trust Law—The 8uprem* Court Decisions. In May.last thfe Supreme court haq£. -ed down decisions,. In the suits in {equity brought by the United States to ,v enjoin, the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri. can Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the bust 

|IIBSB world authoritatively of the scope -J and operation of the anti-trust act of 1890. Tbe decisions do not depart in iany substantial way from the previous .•-decisions-Of the court in construing and applying this important statute, •(but they Clarify those important deci sions by fyrther defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con 8truction of the. act. By the decrees, they furnish a useful precedent as to ... the proper method of dealing with tbe capital and property of Illegal trusts. a These decisions suggest the need and' .'wisdom of additional or supplemental' r-j legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with 'the rule of action and legality, thus finally established and to preserve •vtbe benefit, freedom and spur of rea sonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress- No Change* In the Rule of Merely in Its Form of Expression: The statute In its first section de- c'are8 $ v"k- to be illegal "every contract. combination in tbe form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint trade or commerce among tbe sev- ft^i-Veral states or ,with foreign nations," ir5»5and in the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to-monopolize any part of the": trade or commerce of tbe several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where the statute was Invoked to. enjoin a transportation agreement between interstate railroad companies, It WBB held that It w&j no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonal at common law, because it was said that the statute Vas directed against all contracts and combinations In re straint of trade whether reasonal at common law or not It was, plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of in those cases would '. not. have been deemed: reasonable' at common law„ In subsequent cases the court said that the statute should be given a reasonal constructlon and re-. fused to include within Its Inhibition certain contractual- restraints of trade which it dominated as Incidental .or -jtyf &>£"*# ^Bv as indirect These cases of restrqint of trade that the, court excepted ft onp the operation of the statute were lnstances whicbj at common law, would have been called reasonable. In tbe Standard OU and: Tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the testa of tb* taut mon law, and In defining exceptions to tbe literal application of the statnte, only substituted for the teat of' beincr incidental or .Indirect, that of being treasonable and this, without varying in the, slightest tha actual scope and •effect of the statute. Ia other wprda, all the cases under the statute which jhave now been decided would huva^ fbeen decided the kame way if ttaepoiirt had originally accepted'in its cOBslrno-: (tloa tbe ml* at common law.

1TAFT MEN LAY DOWN. Befuse to Carry Snoh a Heavy Load in March Primaries. Minneapolis, Dec. 2.— Charles B. Cheney, political editor of the Minne apolis Journal, in a Grand Forks letter to his paper says: 'Senator LaFollette will get ten 'delegates from North Da kota in the republican national con vention without a contest. The Taft men have subdued the combative spirit of a few like James Kennedy, national committeeman, and Jim Shea, United States marshal, and it is understood that no Taft candidates for delegates will be put up in the primaries next March. "Canadian reciprocity is at the bot tom of it all. North Dakota, of all states, was the most bitterly opposed to the president's agreement with Canada. A protest against it was joined in by stalwarts and progressives alike. Factional differences never were lost sight of so completely. Fol lowing Canada's rejection of the pact, when wheat wont up, North Dakota farmers were convinced beyond any possibility of a change that the admin istration had tried to sacrifice them. Their prejudice against Taft is Wedding: at Ellendale-' The marriage of R. 6. Newton, of Monango, and Miss Annie Phillips, of Ellendale, took place Thanksgiving day at the home of the bride in Ellendale, Rev. J. C. Engel of the Presbyterian church at Monango officiating. The groom is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Newton of Monango, and the bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. Phillips of Ellendale, and for the past several years has been deputy county auditor. The bride and groom arrived in this city last evening for a visit at the C. A. Newtofi TJigyjire just oh their way back from Underwood, where they spent, tne week with Rev. and Mrs. David. Lano. A Canning Factory.* Secretary Guy of the Commercial Club is in communication with The Hastings Industrial Company of Chi cago, who are greatly interested in the project of a canning factory for this city. They are anxious to get the peo ple interested, as a factory of this kind will avail little unless the whole com munity takes hold and guarantees to raise enough produce to supply an institution of this kind. It does not take much to equip a factory—the main thing is to get the farmers inter ested enough to grow peas,' beans, ton matoes, etc. And there would be no trouble there if there was a good market. :-M 1 mm S Carroll Drew and the Dott Sisters will present their comedy sketch "A Day in the Country," at the Grand Theatre Thursday, Friday and Satur day this week.

A committee was appointed to see that the scholars in the grades and high school were pro vided with material to aid them in writing essays, prizes for which are to be given by the state. The following article in regard to these prizes was read by Mrs Sack rider.

It is a favorite threat that if Taft is nominated, the North Dakota farmers will support any man the dem ocrats put up, possibly barring Har mon. Many business men take the at titude. .rIA{: r-i\$ WILL J. R. VALLEY GET THE ST. LOUIS? Question That is Now Puzzling .- Cities Along the Pro posed Route. Leola Way Appears to be Pop ular With Officials But Not Finally Decided. Statements are being printed in the papers of the state to the effect that the long talked of extension of Minne apolis and St. Louis road from Leola, S. D., into North Dakota, is likely to be made in the the near future and that engineers have been at work on preliminary surveys. One of the re ports in this connection is that the road may run northwest through Mcintosh, Logan and Kidder counties, but the latest report is that the line will find a direct connection into Jamestown and north by connecting with the Midland Continental at Edgeley. Leola is about 50 miles from Edgeley, almost in a direct line south. The Midland Conti nental is projected from Edgeley to Forbesnear the southern line of Dickey county, and it is seen that a very smal distance would have to be spanned to connect with the M. and St. L. and the Midland at Edgeley thence to James town. A copy of the Crandall, S. D., Times of November 25th, has an interesting article in regard to the rumored exten sion of the new line. It stated that the preliminary surveys for a north and south line, beginning further east from the point on the M. and St. L. in South Dakota, were abandoned on account of the hilly and unfavorable agricultural country, and the intention of the com pany is now to run the north and south line extension beginning at some point west of Aberdeen and continue north through the James River Valley. The Red river country which has been striving to secure this new ex tension is now out of it, according to the Times, for various physical reasons. It is reported that the M. and St L„ which now belongs to one of the great est systems of the country, known as the Hawley system, has plenty of money for any proposed extension it may desire to make. The trade and business for a north and south line through North and South Dakota is a big prize for any railroad company to secure. The Crandall Times speaking of this proposed extension, says: "The pride, prestige and push of these two states is going to win. The whole Jim Valley is in the fight, pro claiming the fact that we have the bet ter location, more and better territory, greater resources, thriving cities and towns, freedom from snow blockades and a level country to build through. Not only that, but the leading cities are offering to help build the road. "The new line will be built up the Jim, ffct the point from which it will start has not been. determined. In formation from Jamestown leads to the conclusion that"Leola stands a mighty good chance. The Midland Continental grade completed only last year from Jamestown to Edgeley, will figure^ in the rivalry between up river North Dakota cities. Edgeley is fifty miles north of Leola and the country between them is not bad to build through. That route would open up some good new territory for the Jamestown wholesale and jobbers and not closely parallel ain other road. But it would miss the cities of Oakes, LaMoure, and Ypsi lanti, all of which are going to object strenuously. The fight between those cities is going to be the determining factor as to where the road starts. This does not mean that Jamestown will oppose the other cities, but that the Continental w.U be a bone of con tention, and Leola may lose out.- And if it does, it is up to Britton or Cran dall.
