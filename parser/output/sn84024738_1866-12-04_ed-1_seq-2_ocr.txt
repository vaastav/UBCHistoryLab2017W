oitd ?p ? DECEMBER 4, 1866. President* 8 Message. p#f*!rjc President's annual message appears 5 In our paper this morning. To those who do not wish to read the whole of the docu ment a resum^ of its contents will not be unacceptable. The President adheres to liis restoration policy, and sets forth its advantages. He leaves the inference to be unavoidably drawn that Congress is clearly wrong and he as clvarly right. The arguments he employs have all been used before. Tet he mentions two facts which make a good point as agnin.sk Congress, namely : that on the 6th of August, 1861, Congress appor. lioned the direct tax among the seceded States, and on the 4th of March, 1862, ap portioned representatives among them. He repeats that the civil authority has every, where been restored, and says that he knows of no measure moro imperatively demanded hy every consideration of nation al interest, sound policy, and equal justice, than the admission of *4 loyal members" from the southern States. We have little t > J i opo from such representation as oven Mr. Johnson recommends. The President warns Congress of the dangers of consolidation or despotism. He is too late. He and others, who ought to have known better, have entirely changed the form of our Government. It is already i:<>t only a consolidated one, but a pure ! desjKrtism. We could easily cite, as we have heretofore done, numerous instances going to prove the fact of this change. But we need not take so much trouble when we can find the proof in the President's message. Mr. Johnson says to Congress: " Wo should hasten to briv <j legislation 41 within the boundaries prescribed by the Con - 44 stitution." That is, the Constitution has now for five years been treated as a dead letter, and those who, before performing their first official act, were sworn to sup port that instrument, are thus declared by implication to have been constantly viola ting it. In other words, this Government could not have become a despotism if the Constitution had been respected; but as the Constitution has been confessedly set aside, and the will of Congress and the Executive substituted therefor, this Go. vernment cannot be anything hut a despot ism . The public debt in fourteen months was reduced '<y the sum of $206,379,505, and to the sura of $2,551,310,006 (October 31st). The expenditures IV ?r the year ending June 3<?th, 1>G6, were $520,750,y4U ; receipts, s?5>\032,020. The army and the navy are passed iu re view. We feel no interest in them. The Post-ollice Department is not quite self->upporting, owing to the increased mail facilities extended to us of the South. The public lands, and homesteads, and grants to railroad companies, and all those subjects so dear to our northern friends, are treated of. The Pacific railroads are going ahead. Pensioners afe numerous and increasing in number. We give the President crcdit for recom mending to Congress the appropriation of money to preserve the levees of the Missis sippi river. We would that he had remem bered that great national work the James Kiver and Kanawha canal. The District of Columbia is remembered. The President advises Congress to allow it a Territorial member ? that is, one to speak but not to vote. The President reports that there arc "no ' "foreign combinations against our peace! 44 and safety." Vet he speaks very plainly of our relations with France, which, how ever, are by no means complicated. The only question seems to be whether Jsa ro].Eo\ shall withdraw all his troops from Mexico next year, or part this year and the rest next year (which latter he had agreed t" (I ?)? We feel confident that there is no re:i>,?n to anticipate any trouble with France. Mr. Campbell goes as Minister to the " Republic of Mexico," and General Sher man merely to observe and report. There is nothing secret or important iu their mis won. The Atlantic telegraph is mentioned, but Mr. Johnson seems to think that the Pacific telegraph will be a more important *urk in its results. The Alabama claims against England are mentioned in general terms. The Fenian raid upon Canada is alluded to, and the President's course in regard to it justified. The President thinks we ought to send a Minister to Greece. As to the long-disputed question in re. gard to naturalization, Mr. Joiinsox says the present is a favorable time for settling it. Of course by compelling all other na tions to concede that a man who has be come a citizen of the United States can. not be forced to perform military duty in the land of his nativity no matter how often he may visit it. The Examiner. The* Examiner is indignant because the Richmond press did not Tollow its example and strike some additional blows upon Mr. PoLLARD'fl prosjiectus. That is ungener ous in the Examiner. Was not its heroic protest sufficient? Did Achillas complain because no one flayed the body of Hector as he dragged it round the walls of Troy ? Then, the Examiner denies the right of his brethren of the press to hope for support unlets they express their views on so great a matter as the Pollard prospectus. Con sidering the magnitude of the offence, and the disinterestedness of the judgment, we know nothing in the press of late that can at all compare with this. No wonder that the whitest frost of the season appeared yesterday morning. The Examiner was so cool! Ob, ?' votes ^ my bsart:" Oh ! New 1 k Tto Old Franklin Almanac for 1867.

ASSEMBLY OF TIROIHIA. The General Assembly of Virginia (now meeting annually, but elected bionnially,) assembled yesterday in the cajr.itol in this city. It being the second session of the members elect, there were no forms ol organization to take place. There not being a quorum in the Senate, however, both bodies adjourned* without receiving the Governor'# message. We give below such proceedings as occurred : Monday, December 3, 1S6G. SENATE. The Senate assembled at 12 o'clock. Lieutenant-Governor Cowper, on taking the chair, said : Senators, ? Time has rolled around, and brought the period ol the annual assem bling of the Legislature of which you form a part. I need not assure you who know me that I am most happy to welcome you to the assembling of this body, nor of my most hearty cooperation in all measures necessary for the prosperity of our beloved I Commonwealth. Committing to your wis dom such legislation as that interest re quires, 1 again assure you that I am happy to meet you, to find you in good health, and express the ardent hope that your pro ceedings may he conducted in a spirit of harmony and good feeling. 1 now pro. nouncc the Senate of \ irginia opcu for the transaction of business. Messrs. Robert Ould, of Richmond city, and F. B. Miller, of Botetourt, newly elected Senators, were sworn in, and took their seats. The roll was then called by the clerk, Shelton C. Davis, Esq., and the following Senators answered to their names : Nathaniel Alexander, Peter Belew, George W. Boiling, David S. G. Cabell, Clayton G. Coleman, Joseph W. Davis, James Gait, Elisha F. Keen, Christopher C. Mcliae, F.B.Miller, Hubert C. Mitchell, Robert Ould, and Edmund C. Robinson. There being no quorum present, on mo tion of Mr. Robinson, of Norfolk, the Sen ate adjourned until Tuesday at 12 o'clock. JIOUSE OF DELEGATES. At 12 o'clock, admonished by the Speak er's gavel, the members present were seated, and a prayer was offered up appr o priate to the occasion by the Rev. Paul Bagley, of Maryland, a missionary lately returned from travels in Japan, China, In dia, and Europe. Mr. Speaker Baldwin called the House to order, and it being found upon the roll call that a quorum was present, Mr. Har riett, of Essex, was deputed to inform the Senate of the fact, and that the j House was ready to proceed to business. There were sixty delegates present. Mr. Garnctt soon returned, and informed the House that there was not a uroruni present in the Senate, and that that body had adjourned : whereupon, on his motion, the House adjourned until to-morrow . (Tuesday) at 12 o'clock, without further prooeeding^^ A Bevoliitlouary Scheme. We learn that at the Radical caucus held Saturday evening the programme was pre sented declaring the State organizations of the ten excluded States to be unconsti tutional, and providing for the appointment of commissioners by Congress with power to organize military forces, including blacks, for the 44 protection " of the public interests, and to call conventions for the purpose of organizing State gmernmcnts that shall be acceptable to Congress. This plan met with some opposition, and was not adopted finally, but lies over to an ad journed meeting "\\ ednesdaj night next. National Republican, 3<f. Tho Baltimore American (Radical) thus states the programme : 44 It contemplates an abolition of tho pre sent State governments in all the southern States, on the ground of their unconstitu tionality, and provides for the appointment of commissioners f<*r each State, who shall have power to appoint all civil and military officers necessary for the preservation of peace and good order. The commissioners are to call conventions for tho purpose of adopting constitutions, with a view to ad mission into the Union. There is a differ ence of opinion as to the right of franchise. Some are in favor of only loyalists voting, i some in favor of Congress designating who j shall and who shall 'not vote, whilst others advocate allowing all those to vote who ar? now qualified under State laws. The con stitutions adopted by these conventions arc to be respected, but only those to be al ! lowed to vote w ho aro enfranchised by the I constitutions voted on, as was the case in Maryland. If constitutions be adopted by these voters, then the States to be re admitted. If rejected, the rejection to be fallowed by territorial governments. The commissioners are to be authorized to or ganize the militia, including the colored population, to aid in carrying out the pro visions of the bill, and it called into ser vice are to be quartered on those rendering the call necessary." The Supreme Tonrt of the I'uitcri States. The Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supremo Court of the United States have all arrived in the city, except Judge Grier, who is confined to his home, having so entirely lost the use of his limbs that he cannot walk or even stand. The term of the court will commcncc at 11 o'clock to-day. ? National Iiepublivant3d. Impartial Suffrage in Alabama. New York, December 2. ? In the Ala. bama House of Representafives yesterday Mr. Brooks presented a bill to alter the Constitution of the State so as to admit of conditional negro suti'rage. The condi. tions are that the voter shall possess pro perty to the amount of two hundred dol lars, and shall be able to tead the Consti tution of the State and of the United States, and write a legible hand. The conditions also to hold good iu the case of white men. ? Mr. Brooks was closely identified with the Confederate cause, having expended his last dollar in its support ; and in pre senting the bill he said that he did so as a measure of policy, and for the public good. After an exciting debate the bill vfts tabled. The Hoipenalon Bridge. Cincinnati, December 1. ? The great suspension bridge was opened to foot pas sengers to-day, and it is estimated that not less than 50,000 persons crossed it. A Mew Kind or Gas Id Caaada. Cohubo, December 1. ? This town was lighted last night with gas made from pine wood, bones, and refuse vegetable and animal matter. The light was quite bril liant, suqMssing that from gas manu factured from coal, which has been previ ously used, while it will be much more economical.

Spirit of the IHrrtlny, Ac. Washington, December 2.? -Tho caucus i of llio Republican nieuiburs ??f tho House j held last evening was attended by about I seventy members. None of the Senators . were present. Hon. J. S. Morrill, of Ver. ' raont, was choscn chairman, and K. <\ In. gcreoU, of Illinois, secretary. Hon.Tliad. Stevens ottered a resolution that the Se mite be requested to ref use to conlirm ap- 1 pointments made by the President during the recess to till vacancies caused by re movalson political grounds. The resolu tion was discussed by Mtssrs. Steven", Darling, Boutwcll, and Kelly, and finally passed without a dissenting voice, though several members present had, in private conversation, said they were opposed to any interference with the law as it now stands. On motion of Mr. Darling, it was agreed that each Republican SenatoMhall be served with a copy of the foregoing re solution, tho chairman to decide who are such Republican Senators. Mr. Stevens facetiously remarked that he would speak to Senator Cowan, there.* fore notice need not bo served on that Senator. Upon motion of Mr. Stevens, a commit tee of ten, consisting of Messrs. Stevens, Sehenck, Bout well, Allison, Washburne (of Illinois), Paine, Hart, Garfield, Ortli, and McRuer, was appointed to consider and report what measures and legislation are necessary for immediate action by Con gress, un?l that they report at an adjourned meeting on Wednesday next. Upon motion of Mr. Spaulding, of Ohio, the committee was instructed to consider the pjoposition to change t ho law conve ning Congress on the tirst Monday in De cember, so as to have that body meet pricr to that date. Mr. Stevens announced that he intends immediately to introduce a bill to regulate j the tenure of oflice, tho chief features | being that the President shall, w ithin twenty days after the Senate convenes, submit a list of all appointments made during recess. All appointees who may be rejected by the Senate shall be ineligi ble tor any olliee under the Government for three years thereafter. Whenever it becomes necessary for the President to make removals for disability or nfal fea sance in olliee, he shall assign the reasons for such removals within twentyjdays after the meeting of the Senate. In case of the rejection of any person appointed by the President, the olliee shall revert to his pre decessor (except in eertaiu cases), and all subordinate appointments made by the person so rejected shall fall with hi* reject tion, and their positions likewise revert to their predecessors. The caucus then ad journed to meet on cducsduy evening next. The spirit manifested by the meeting towards the President was decidedly war like ; though it should he borne in mind that the extreme Radical leaders of the House were of this caucus, whilst not quite half the number of Republican mem bers and none of the Senators were pre sent. In discussing this action to-day, there arc some members who object to the clause providing that upon rejection of an appointee the olliee shall revert to the pre decessor. The objection to this proposition is that it is retroactive, and then-fore in operative as to appointments already made, and wnich det ive their power and authority from and are controlled by the Constitu tion, and the laws made thereunder, and now in full force and cllect. Data. The General Assembly? Tlie ( losing Dhj. The Central Assembly of tlic- Presbyte rian Church in the United States met at i> o'clock yesterday morning ? tlic moderator, Kev. A. 11. Kerr, in the chair. The Assembly was constituted by Rev. Donald Frazier ottering up a f?*rveiit prayer. Kev. Dr. Baird submitted the following minute, which was added to the report of the Committee on the Relation ol' the Church to the Frcedmen: Resolved h[f the (fenerul Awmlh/ of th> I'resbytuian Church in the i'nited Statis, That every Presbytery under the jurisdic tion of this body be enjoined to seek out | and set apart a minister to the work of the j Evangelist, for its bounds, to act as super- 1 iutcmient of its vacant congregations wherever practieuble. These superintend ents shall be authorized t<? act iis mode rators of the sessions of the vacant congre gations, to preach the Gospel and adninis t'*r the sacraments to them at staled inter vals, to counsel the serious in holding so cial worship in the absence of ministers, and in general to take the pastoral super vision of the vacant congregations, both white and colored; to encourage the organization of Sabbath schools and Bible classes, and the making of oblations for systematic benevolence. But when a suit able evangelist cannot be obtained, then the Presbytery is enjoined to apportion such organizations among its ministerial members of the same object, so that every congregation and all our freed people shall enjoy the pastoral superintendence in tixeir assemblies of some minister. Resolved, That every Presbytery be en- 1 joined to require the vacant congregations to come up to the discharge of the duties devolved on them in the twenty-first chap ter of the Form of Government in the" as sembling^' their respective congregations j for the worship of God, to which it is pro- j per to add exhortation. And in order that j this duty may be performed to the greater acceptance of the- worshippers, it is fur- ! ther required that the Presbyteries do seek i out their elders who have the best gifts, and do especially license and appoint them to the performance of their duties. Rusolvtdy That our ministers who are not now engaged in their sacred calling be , exhorted to come up to "our help, it they I do not lind fields of labor in their preseut j localities; that they arc exhorted to seek other places of abode and fields of labor j where they may be useful. And that the j Presbyteries be enjoined to examine their rolls, and require all ministers who are not employed togive an account of themselves, and to proceed against those who are found to be habitual neglectors of their vows of ordination. Resolved, That every Presbytery be en joined to take the whole minutes into con sideration, and act upon it at its first meeting after the rising of the General Assembly; the Synods to inquire into the fidelity of the Presbyteries ; and that both Presbyteries and Synods give a report of what tliey have done, or failed to do in the premises, to the next General Assembly. The minutes and report were adopted. ? After the adoption of some unimportant reports, votes of thanks were tendered to the citizens of Memphis for their hospitali ties; to the members of the press, and to the managers of railroads and steamboat companies. The Moderator then addressed the As sembly in a few feeling and most appropri ate remarks, and after devotional exercises the proceedings terminated, and the Mod. erator declared the Assembly dissolved.
