One of the editors of the Beloit Cour ier is Oral Item Caldwell. An oral Item is the next best thing to a written ene. The pension report shows 537,944 persons on the pension rolls. Uncle gam is no niggard when it comes to recognizing his soldiers. Bion Hutchins seems to be the only editor in Kansas who took Mrs. Lease seriously. He is devoting two columns to her weekly this late in the season. It may be well to note that all the half million or more pensioners of the government owe the fact that they re ceive pensions to the republican party. Senator fl.B. Kelly, in the McPher on Freeman, thinks that the country has not had too much tariff talk. On the contrary it needs more. As con gress has met Kelly will have a chance to be satisfied. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch yester day gave a map of the United States showing the democratic states in white, the republican in black. Kansas was put down as white. Wonder where the P-D got its information? When a young man robbed two inno cent and superannuated executors in Pennsylvania last week of S10,000,000, the dispatches said he had "misappro priated" the sum. Had it been $10 "stolen" would have been used Is it any greater treason for a Kan. gas republican member of the alliance to vote for a straight republican for United States senator, than for a Georgia democrat member of the alli ance to vote for Gen John B. Gordon? A proposition is made to send Sit ting Bull and other warlike Indian chiefs into exile in .Florida. The Land of Flowers is a pretty warm place, but frontiersmen will insist that It isn't hot enough for murderously. Inclined Indians. "Mrs. Lease's Veracity Questioned" Is a headline in Sunday's Capital. "Questioned" is putting it very mildly. If she has not been proved a premedi tate'! and uncon scion able prevaricator np and'down the length of Kansas then facts and figures are deceivers. Enterprise-Journal: Who would not feel proud to be a people's party repre sentative and have two men follow him to Topeka to watch him? The people feel -proud of such men for it proves that the people, when so . dis? posed, can elect the most arraritf dema gogue and political scalawag in exis tence. A New York man pertinently asks: 'Why is it that the Herald and other free trade papers cry high prices by reason of the McKinley bill and at the same time advertise goods for less than ever sold before?" It is because they do not care to tell the truth In their editorial columns. Cincin nati Commercial-Gazette. Senator Vest says that Ingalls will make one of the greatest speeches of his life from his place in the senate this winter. He adds: "The interest ing subject will be Grover Cleveland. I know Ingalls better than any one in this neck of the woods, 3nd I predict that he will roast Cleveland on acconnt of the latter's letter to Nelson F. Acres. It will be a great opportunity for Ingalls, and he will make the best of it. I simply pity Cleveland, that's all. He will be fairly incinerated. ' ' Cleveland calls Nelson F. Acres, of Kansas, "a fool" because he told what Mr. Cleveland wrote him about Ingalls. Mr. Cleveland wrote a very silly letter and we do not wonder he is ashamed of it. His way of characterizing those whom he is at outs with must be gen erally recognized both gentlemanly and courteous. The next man will probab ly be called a fool and the next after that a fool. Such delicate criticism as Mr. Cleveland ia dalges in should endear him to his friends even while he chides them. The large lake at Lamed is doing consider able damage. In its neighborhood several irella haTO become useless and it is feared that the trees will be damaged all from the Mlt which soaks into the gronnd near the take.! Newton Republican. Nature does not like too much inter ference with her processes. The soil of southwestern Kansas is underlaid by and which allows an easy percolation of water.- The old mill race near .Hutchinson ruined thousands of acres y this underground circulation, the atecoming up through the soil and bringing along withjit ths alkali that had lain hidden. It is sometimes un wise to attempt to "gild refined gold, jpaint the lily" or improve on nature. Thanksgiving Delusions. Thanksgiving has as many disap pointments and shams connected witn it as anything else that is made a specialty. We give it credit for things that do not belong to it; we pin on to its coat tail, so to speak, a lot of trash that if people were not polite enough not to notice would make it a laughing stock. Thanksgiving in itself is the truest American holiday, it is the day of days when we are thoroughly at home and comfortable. It is the day when we get good natured and garru lous; it is the day when we are all friends. But there are certain addenda which are inseparably connected with the occasion that are delusions. For in stance, there are those Thanksgiving dinners that are outlined in the maga zines, the papers and the books on 'How to Support a Family of Six on 37 Cents a Month." How they teem with goodies! How we long to eat them! But such bills of fare were never seen outside of a newspaper column. They bubble over with blue points and terrapin and champagne; they are gorgeous, appetizing, mag nificent. But they are to be read about, not eaten. When it comes to eating we get down to straight old fashioned turkey and pumpkin pie with a little cider and some hickory nuts on the. side to end with. The newspaper bills of fare are delusions and snares though we often long to see" them realized. Then there are certain Thanksgiving stories whose heroes are low-browed villains, guilty of stealing watermelons or robbing hens' nests in their youth and so banished from home. With a remarkable discrimination they choose Thanksgiving day for their return and come bursting in on the members of the family just as they are picking their teeth and the chicken bones. Everybody thought the graceless son dead and at rest but he moans out a pitiful tale of Oklahoma and sorrow, and is forgiven aud marries the red headed girl who helped him to eat the watermelons that he stole. Don't take any stock in that kind of stories. They are delusions. The son didn't get back on Thanksgiving day but the week be fore and when he -lid arrive he was arrested by Marshal Hess, put in jail and spent Thanksgiving wishing he had stayed away from Sheriff Naill's palatial residence; while the red-headed girl went to to the firemen's ball with a Solomon City peanut vender. There is likewise a good deal of guile about the Thanksgiving procla mation. There was a time when the proclamation depended on the crops and the president got out his big quill pen and laboriously traced something like ajard-of manuscript calling atten tion to the day. Now the probabilities are that he never saw the document until it appeared in the papers. His private secretary dictated it to a pretty type-writer girl who rattled it off and signed it with a rubber stamp, exactly as if it were a veto of Salina's public building bill. It is all a piece of gov ernmental machinery and the invita tions for the Thanksgiving ball on the last Thursday in November were out before the proclamation was issued. People knew it would come no matter if the Hessian Uy took the wheat, the weevil the corn and the opposition carried every township in the country. ; We do not say these things to make you undervalue Thanksgiving. It is not a day to be undervalued. Neither is it a day to be taken for what it is not. It is a good, wholesome, honest, old-fashioned day of resting and having a big dinner. - There is associated with it by nearly every one a reverence for the all Pow erful Father who brought them through the year. That is Thanksgiving and as such a day it is a success and is suffi cient in itself with out any added sidsehowsorgift enterprises. The Pension Deficit. A good deal of commotion is caused by the apparent pension deficit of over forty million dollars and some papers, particularly from the south, are calling for the partial repeal or modification of the pension laws. There is little danger, however, of this as the demo crats even with their big majority would hesitate long before they at tempted to undo the good the republi can party has done for the soldier. But while they possess no such power, it shows the democratic drift. This pension deficit is caused not so much by the operation of the recent dependent law as by the liberal man agement of the pension bureau in cases uder the older laws. As is known, these old cases draw arrearages when allowed. This piles up the immediate pension outlay. As an instance, one old fellow in New York, who has not long to live, proved that his blindness originated In the military service, and the allowance of his pension carried with it over fifteen thousand dollars as arrearages. These arrearage dis bursements are no indication, however, of what the permanent expenditures will ultimately demand. Of course, they will be large, but this republican administration believes that the laborer is worthy cf his hire, and that the soldier has justly earned .all and more than ho gets. Election returns are still coming in big failures every day. , About half the papers know who will be nominated for the presidency in 1892. We don't. President Polk, of the nation al'far mers' alliance, travels in a private pal ace car and pays no transportation, accepting the railroads' iiospitality. Lyman to Dan. Colonel v. R. Anthony, of the Leav enworth Times, having come to the conclusion that Willits has been elect ed, took the occasion to address Gov ernor Humphrey a note of congratula tions. It will be remembered that the colonel refused to support the head of the ticket in his paper. The letter was as follows: .Leavenworth, Kas., Nov. 6. Hon. L. U. Humphrey, Gov. of Kas. My Dear Sir: We are busted! Shake. The opposition of thd Leaven worth Times did not elect you, a3 our dearly beloved brother Joe Hudson pre dicted. But the Times always tells the truth. The Leavenworth Times never tells a lie. Confession is good for the soul, and is the first evidence of genuine repentance. I had not in tended to call, but if agreeable I will call upon the governor of Kansas at an early day in January, and extend my warmest congratulations to him. I am, dear governor, as ever; yours in truth and eternal justice. D. B. Anthony. Subsequent events showed that Col onel Anthony was a little premature, and Humphrey not Willits was the winner. Finally the governor reached Colonel Anthony's letter in due course, ernong the delayed correspondence and panned the following epistle: Col. D. R. Anthony, Leavenworth, Kas.: My Dear Colonel: Your very considerate letter of the Cth instant reached this office during my absence from the capital. I ran across it this morning in a mass of neglected corre spondence, all of a congratulatory character, too, and I hasten to make reply. When I tell you that I am very busy just now, administering the af fairs of the state with equal and exact justice to all, I know you will, in your heart of hearts, excuse me for not hav ing made earlier reply. It may be, my dear colonel, th; t the opposition of the Leavenworth Times did elect me "as our dearly bt loved brother Joe Hudson predicted," .jut I feel charitably disposed and will let it pass. While your defeat is no di ubt a source of regret to you, I presume you have become accustomed to tho fre quency with which this happens, and I assure it can make no differei ce in my estimation of you. And I sh ill be pleased to meet you in my office "at an early day in January," or at any other time within the next two years My term of office will expire about th 14th day of January, 1893. I always make it a point to give cordial recept in to every citizen of Kansas, no matt r how humble in life he may be, or how often he may suffer defeat at the hai. Js of his constituency. Please let me know just what day you will call in Ja mary, and I will strain a point to be :n the executive office. By the way, my dear colonel, did it ever occur to you that some peo, le al ways manage to laugh just wheio the laugh really does not come in? Yours in peace. 

LY3IAN U. HUMPnfiEY. A Newspaper Sub-Treasury. The Hutchinson Republican sarcas tically suggests that the newspaper fra ternity strongly favor and urgen 'y in sist upon the passage of the sul -treasury bill, providing they can get a clause inserted m the law authorizing newspaper men to store the production of their presses in the government store house an1 draw 80 per cant en the same until purchased by the read ing public. Kansas' Apportionment. The matter of the re-apportionment is one that is attracting much att2ntion in KansaB. The probable basis of membership of the lower house cf con gress will be about 345. On thi j basis Kansas will get but eight congressmen, an increase of one. This will hi a dis appointment to some budding poli ticians who were counting on tw o new congressmen and a general shak.ng up of the present districts. The indica tions are that with the rapid growth of the southwest the increase of one will be absorbed in that section of the state. The Latest Idiocy. The newest financial scheme of the people's party and the one by which they intend to continue to deceive the farmers into standing by them is the most ridiculous of its many diotic plans for plunging the state and jation into financial disaster. As outlined by one of the a.liance lecturers of this county, he doi btless receiving instructions from hea iquar ters, it is as follows: The goyeriment is to loan money to the farmera at 1 per cent. The state is to guarantee the loans through its executive board and make good any losses by the sale of state bonds. Each county is to guarantee to the state the loans in its territory through the county cc mmis sioners, making good losses by county bonds. Each township is to guErantee to the county the loans made in ts ter ritory through the township board and make good all losses by issuing town ship bonds. Each farmer will borrow all he wants to the full value of h,s land and whistle in his sleeve when the pay day comes around. This is very much after the style of the famous Kentucky road which decreased to a trail, the trail to r path and the path to a squirrel track which ran up a tree. If any supposed sen sible man can see anything but idiocy and knavery with financial desolation to end with in this latest scheme, his sanity should be investigated a once. D. J. Cole, of Hutchinson, is ne lat est applicant for the United Stat s sen atorship. If pictures of him io not lie he is the homliest man in the state. The coming convention to consider irrigation will be one of the mess im portant meetings" of the year fc west ern Kansas. If a sure and j-asible system of irrigation can be give i west ern .rxansas it will be worth millions to the state. The Message. President Harrison's message to the second session of the Fifty-first con gress, which is given in our telegraph columns, is characteristic of jts con servative and brainy author. Mr. Harrison is in thorough accord with his party on all of the important questions of state and his utterances on the recently adopted tariff measure are particularly worthy of thoughtful consideration. He calls attention to fact that the tariff has yet had no real trial. It has been in effect less than 60 days and many of the schedules will not be in force for months yet. He does not pronounce it perfect no law probably ever was perfect but be lieves it will prove the best tariff measure the country ever knew. In this he has the hearty support of the best men of the republican party and of the nation, In his appeal forjpurer elections Mr. Harrison is particularly felicitous. The demand for pure elections, a fair ballot and a full count, are among the demands of all parties and all sections where honest men are found. That more stringent'.laws for securing these are necessary is generally admitted and in accordance with the president's message decisive action will be doubt less taken by congress. It is often said "who reads a presi dent's message?" and with some justice but the present document is one so practical and interesting that none can afford to miss a perusal of it. Northerners Don't Count. The total vote cast in Mississippi for congressmen was about 61,000, the number of congressman being seven. That is to say, a congressman from that state represents less than 9,000 votes. The total vote on congressmen in Kansas was about 277,000 and seven congressmen were elected. That is to say, a congressman from this state rep resents nearly 40,000 votes. Hence a white man in Kansas is worth just nine-fortieths as much politically as a white man in Mississippi, or four and a half Kansans are necessary to equal a Mississippian. Is it any wonder that; the republicans of the north demand a fair ballot or else a reduction of south ern representation? As Others See It. The New York World says: alliance men of Kansas made a "The great feature in the late campaign of adver tising their poverty. In this they were successful, but it was not a valu able advertisement for Kansas as a farming country. The 'country' had nothing to do with the grievances of whicli the farmers' alliance complain ed. The soil aud the climate are not responsible for the depression of the agricultural industry in Kansas. There is no other state in the union where farming can be made so remuner ative under proper conditions, in Kansas, or where it can carried on with as small an outlay labor and money." as be of The Mills Re-Open. In spite of the depression caused in the financial world by the democratic victory at the polls Nov. 4th there is so much confidence felt in the perma nency of the McKinley bill as a tariff measure that manufactories which have long remained idle are again starting up and the smoke from tall chimneys is again coloring the skies of the manufacturing villages where the looms and the spindlesbave long been silent. The Utica (N. Y.) Observer, a staunch democratic paper of the Em pire state, has this item in a recent is sue: Clark's mills, which have lain idle since September. 1839, were purchased Saturday by H. O.Harrison and Arthur Binds, of New York City, and it is said, will hereafter be used for the manufacture of of silk plushes. The village has been well nigh deserted since the shutting down of these mills, and their re-opening is hailed with joy by the residents. The buildings will be at once re paired and rmodeled and when put in operation will be tho only manufactory of the kind in this countiy. So the tariff on the costly silk plushes has already given in that one place employment to several hundred people who did not havo it before. If the cost of these plushes are at first en hanced slightly they are purchased only by the wealthy and the few cents a yard will not be felt, But the tariff of a few cents a yard on silk plushes means employment for Americans, it means new industries and new enter prises. The result of the tariff bill's passage seems very acceptable up to date. The alliance people are congratulat ing themselves over the number of rep resentatives in the next congress. The St. Louis Eepublic describes the condi tion of affairs: "The farmers' alliance claims eighty-seven members of the next congress. It should not neglect to state for information, however, that nearly all of them were nominated as democrats, by democratic conventions on democratic platforms and elected by democratic votes. There are only three or four on the whole list who were elected as farmers." The Kansas legislature meets on the second Tuesday in January, which will be on the 13th of the month. The election of the United States sena tor is regulated by federal law. The election of senator will take place on the second Tuesday after the meeting and organization of the legislature, which will make it the 27th of Janu ary. Each house will vote in a viva voce manner separately on the first day. On the second day thfy will meet in joint convention at 12 m., and each day thereafter until some one is elected. The state printer will be elected on the 20th of the month in joint convention. 

PORTRAYED BY POLK, Objects of the Farmers' Alliance and Indus trial Union as Laid Down liy President Folk. Ocaxa, Fla., Dec. a The National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union met in the opera house at noon yester day. Nearly every delegation had ar rived and the hpuee was crowded with Alliance men and women. immediately after calling the dele gates to order President Polk began the delivery of his annual address, which occupied ovor an hour. It congratulated the Alliance on its achievements since the last meeting and thou reviewed the causes of agricultural depression, which was declared an anomaly to the student of industrial progress. "Retrogression in American agriculture," he said, "means National decay, and powerful and promising as is this young giant Republic, yet its power and glory touch not the degradation of the American farmer." Tho harm incident to centralization of the money power and upbuilding of monopolies was then pointed out and both political parties were condemned (or fostering and encouraging this con dition. With reference to extending the order the presidont urged that addi tional organizers be sent at once into Oregon, Washington, Ohio, New York, New Jorsey, Arizona and other States. Among his recommendations was that an organization be formed to be known as the National Legislature, composed of the National president and the ex presidents of all the State Alliances, their duty being to look olosely after legislative reform demanded by the Al liance both in State Legislatures and in Congress. In his recommendation upon the pro posed National legislative council, President Polk said: "I would respect fully suggest that a legislative council be composed of your National presi dent, who shall he ox-offloio chairman, and the presidents of all the State Alli ances represented in the supreme coun cil, and that this body shall hold its an nual meeting within sixty days after the adjournment of tho supreme coun cil, at such time and place as may he designated by tho National president; that It be empowered and authorized to appoint such legislative committees as in its, judgment may be wise, and that it bo required to transmit to each of the States, in printed form, through the National secretary, for distribution to the reform press, lectures and member ship of the order, all measures or bills, together with arguments In their favor as they may decide should be enacted into laws." In relation to tho political action of tho Aliance, President Polk said that while the order was political it could not be partisan or sectional in its ac tion. In support of this declaration he pointed to tho record of the Alliance in the recent popular election, and partic ularly to the noble and patriotic bear ing of the brotherhood in Kansas and South Carolina. In regard to the record of the Alliance during tho past year, and especially with reference to the legislation de manded by it, Mr. Polk declared that Congress had persistently ignored all of their propositions, notably in the case known as the sub-treasury MIL "Congress," he said, "must come nearer to the people or they will got nearer to Congress " In outlining tho future policy of tho Alliance President Polk said that it would demand the restoration of silver to all the rights and qualities of legal tonder which gold possesses; the issu ance of Government currency direct to the people; equalization of taxes; pro hibition of alien ownership of land; ownership and control of transportation lines by the Government; limit ot pub lic revenues to tho economic adminis tration of the Government; graduated taxation of incomes, and the election of United States Senators by a direct vote of th"e people. 

DEFICIENT REVENUES. Government Expenses Much. Above the J'robable Income. Washington, Doc 3. Messrs. James C. Curtis and Thomas P. Cleaves, clerks of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, havo prepared a table giving a comparative statement of the revenues and expenditures of the Government for tho present and the next fiscal year. Estimates for regular annual appropriations for the fiscal year ending January 30, 1892, aggregate 5358,545,361, an increase of S54.572.174 ovor the estimates for the currentyear, and for tho permanent annual appro priations S122.4E3.80S, an lnorease of 520,858,355, making the total estimated needs of the Government for tho next fiscal year 8481,032,109; a total increase of S75.430.529. These estimates do not include any money for rivers and har bors. The total estimated revenues for tho current year are 6440,955,031, mak ing the excess of estimated appropria tions (exclusive of deficiencies and mis cellaneous) over the estimated revenues for 1892 of 34.077,131, an excess of estt mated revenues over estimated appro priations exclusive of S49, 224, 923 for the sinking fund and exclusive of defici encies and miscellaneous of 815,147,790, leaving this amount as a surplus of the sinking fund requirements not met In cluded in tho estimates are S7, 000, 000 for sugar bounties and S4, 000, 000 or 65, 000,000 for payment of drawbacks under the last tariff legislation.
