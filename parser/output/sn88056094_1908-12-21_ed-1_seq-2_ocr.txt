SCOTT :: Editor end Publisher KIDDED THE OVKRPDOW HIDD Congressman French has earned the everlasting gratitude of the peo ple living in this city, along the lake shore and In the valleys of the St. Joe and Coear d'Alene rivers by voluntarily killing his own bill, in traduced last session to permit the Washington Water Power company to overflow Indian reservation lands. It will be remembered that at the last session of congress, through the efforts of Idaho's representatives law was passed creating a national park reserve at the mouth of the St. Joe river, where people could go for an outing and spend a time camping In an Ideal spot. By raising the wat er In the lake the Washington Water Power company has practically de stroyed this park and had It succeed ed in working its overflow bill through congress permitting It to overflow "certain Indian lands" the greater part of the park would have been covered with water, and arms of the lake extended up the St. Joe and Coeur d'Alene rivers ten to twenty miles. The passage of this bill meant that the company would have raised the water In the lake ten feet—and It may do so yet If the people permit It —thus submerging thousands of acres of the best land in Kootenai county and ruining hundreds of farms. It would mean the flooding of the Sher man addition to Coeur d'Alene every spring and ruin to many homes, en tailing a heavy financial loss. The company should be given all possible encouragement In developing its power so long as It does not en croach upon the rights of Ini'.vldunls or the public, and when It doeu this it should be checked. . The code commissioner will submit the result of his labors to the coining legislature for action. This Is proba bly the most Important legislation that will come before the session, as It embraces a complete revision and codification of the laws, with many changes, all of which sboulu be care fully gone Into and studied before be ing adopted, it is a matter requiring the closest attention that blunders, and mistakes may be guarded agalnat. The government has Jus: destroyed ®fty barrels of whiskey under the pure food act. That 'a a good stroke of law enforcement, as linputo boose and adulterated foods are responsible for many of the Ills of the h'.iman race.

(Copyright. 1900. by American Press Aeso elation.) 1 met Mian Tully In a boarding bouse. Uhe was supposed to earn her own liv ing, but no one In the house knew her occupation. 8 be usually went out about 0 o'clock In the morning aud re rnalned moat of the day, but there was nothing regular either about her going or her staying. Sometimes abe would remain In the bouse for several days at a time, and sometimes when abe went out to the morning would return before noon and not go out again. There was a good deal about Mlsa Tully that Interested me. 8be was never for a long period In the same mood. One day she would be merry aa cricket, the next In the depths of deapalr. Then abe would be subject to flta of anger, when no one cared to approach her. Any sensible jhtkoh may Judge from this tbat Mias Tully waa not likely to make a good wife, but I have noticed In young men a dis position to neglect the girls who are especially fitted to make homea com fortable for those who are so const! tuted aa to make a husband's life burden. At any rate, I became fasci nated with Mias Tully's moods. At our first meeting there was a girlish gladness about her that waa simply delicious. A few days later ahe met me with au Imperious look on her face tbat well nigh froae the marrow lu my bones. The next week my pity waa excited by a melancholy that waa no becoming than her aprlghtllnesa or her regal dignity. It was not long before I was madly In love. Hut, realizing the folly of making a life partner of a girl who waa not only changeable as the wind, but whom I knew nothing about—in deed, whose mode of support was mystery—I fought agalnat my passion. All to no purpose. I was caught In a mesh and unable to extricate myself. One evening Mias Tully and 1 were sitting In the drawing room—the board era. seeing my Infatuation, bad by this time come to give up the apartment to us—side by aide on a aofa. it was In the spring of the year, and Miss Tully was like the season, light hearted, ex uberant In spirits and. It seemed to me, willing to listen to love's young dream. Little by little I turned my words upon that dream, which by this time had en thralled me. Miss Tully saw my drift and seemed to yield to a pleased lan guor, listening eagerly to what 1 said. I poured Into her ear all a lover could say. leading up to a proposal, when she stopped me and said ecstatically ; "Bay It all again." I confess I was pussled-Indeed, a trl fie put out. To repeat my glowing words was not to my mind. Fortunate ly wy embarrassment was relieved by a maid entering with a note for Miss Tully. She opened and read It. From that moment ahe was changed. Her light heartedness disappeared and with It her apparent Interest In what 1 had been saying to her. Smarting under this sudden Indifference. I left her. The next evening at dinner I noticed that Miss Tully appeared to have some thing on her mind of an exasperating nature. Her teeth were set, and her eyes were filled with flashes, coming at long Intervals, like heat lightning on a summer night. After dinner 1 was go ing up to my room wheu she passed me In the hall, gave me a glance I did not understand and went into the drawing room. I followed. We were alone there, and. turning on me like a fury. ahe began to accuse me of some unex pressed crime, working herself luto a very demon. In vain I begged her to tell me what I had done. Without heeding me she talked on, or, rather, stormed on, till at last, seeing no pros pect of an end to what waa like a storm swaying to the east, to the west, any where, everywhere In accordance with Its unbridled passion. I left the room. Its unbridled passion. I left the room. The next morning 1 made an effort to escape from this mad creature. I took an early train. For a week 1 remained away, then, professing to myself to feel confident of my ability to resist the fascination, returned to the house and Mias Tully
