' The pope of Rome is in very feeble health. Four persons were recently can onized, and the ceremony was made very 80 that in the latter years of the strug' was associated with the Civil War. He was one of a.little group of young, brave, adventurous cavalry officers who by their energy and dash rendered that arm of the service formidable. During the first year of the rebellion our caval ry was deplorably inefficient. Neither men nor horses were accustomed to the saddle. Our clumsy regiments of clerks and farmer boys mounted on plough horses were no match for the swift and skillful riders of the South. But a little experience made good horsemen of our soldiers and developed a class of com manders with a genius for rapid march ing, quick strategy and sharp fighting, SPBINGPIELD BEPTJBLICAN'S WASHINGTON LETTER. imposing. , By the burning of a theatre in Vien na, Austria, which was burned on Thurs day evening last, nearly three hundred persons perished in the flames. The Inter-Ocean says that Mr. H. B. Porter of 99 State street states that Guiteau told him two years ago that he intended to go to Washington and create a stir which would make his name fa mous all over the world. The enormous circulation attained by the New York Tribune attests its re markable popularity. It stands to-day in the very front rank of American newspapers. This position has been won, in the teeth of the sharpest news paper rivalry, by its enterprise in its news department, by able and brilli ant character of its editorials, and by its unwavering devotion to Republican principles. Its prospectus for 1882, and its great premium offers, will be found another column . gle the Northern cavalry was more then a match for that of the rebels. Among these commanders none won brighter laurels then Judson Kilpatrick. Histo ry may have little to say about the New Jersey politician who wa3 twice Minis ter to Chili, but it will be sure to speak of the brave officer whose squadrons won brilliant victories along the Rappahan nock and on the slopes of the Blue Ridge, and who commanded all the Cav alry in Sherman 's army on the march to the feea. COMMENTS ON THE MESSAGE. The Los Angelo, Daily Times con tains an interview with James W. Sco ville of Chicago, cousin of Guiteau's counsel, at present visiting in this city. Mr. Scoville gave an interesting account of a personal experience of many years with the assassin, and described him as cold-blooded, selfish and thoroughly dis reputable, with no other aim in life than to become notorious. He expresses him self very strongly on the subject of Gui teau's insanity, saying he was perfectly sane and has always been so. Mr. Sco ville condemns his cousin, George Sco ville, and says he desires the vindica tion of the law in the speedy hanging of the assassin. The president's announcement of his purpose that the star-routo rascals shall be pursued with the utmost rigor of the law will give general satisfaction that is, of course, to honest men. But the New York limes can't help wishing he had made his message a little longer by putting in an explicit condemnation of the extravagant and corrupt system which enabled the rascals to do their theiving, and frank admission that the good name of the country and of the ad ministration, and the prospects of the republican party, are intimately con cerned in the success of the efforts now making to bring the public plunderers to justice. "It would be a pity," re marks this leading republican news paper, "if the star-route cases should have no better result than to furnish the democrats with a great deal of effective campaign literature." The observation is one of point and pertinency. The Guiteau trial was continued dar ing last week. Mr. Scoville introduced considerable testimony tending to show that Guiteau and his family were "in sane," but he was obliged to handle his witnesses with great care, as few of them were willing to testify they considered the prisoner insane when he shot the president. The prosecution afterwards used several witnesses who had known the Guiteau family and Guiteau himself for years who testified that they never knew one of them to be insane. Guit eau in the meantime was saucy, ugly and boisterous, while he frequently al luded to hi3 own insanity and remarked that he should be in an asylum within a few weeks. If he was abhorred before the trial, his exhibition and acts during the tria have tended to make him the most detestable creature on earth. It is thought hia case is nearly ended, and, if the evidence is correctly reported, the jury, except it contain some "crank," cannot fail to find a verdict of guilty. The New Orleans Times has the idea: The old opposing sections should be cut so that there would be no north ern and no southern parties. This has been done in Virginia : it may be done in Tennessee, North Carolina and possi bly hereafter in Mississippi, South Car olina and Louisiana. Let these states be divided like New York, Indiana and Ohio, so they shall not belong "body and soul to any party, but will vote upon vital issues for the best men, and then sectionalism will be truly broken up. Georgia and Texas on the one side, and Iowa, Minnesota and Michigan on the other, might continue to roll up their vast party majorities, but party tyranny would then be broken down and men would vote on their judgment and Con sciences rather than at the dictation of a lot of party bosses. This would be a true realization of best results of the American political system, and it is to be attained only by breaking down geo graphical limits in all matters of public policy. News of the sudden death at Santiago on Sunday of General Judson Kilpatrick, our Minister to Chili, was received by the State Department last week. Gen. Kilpatrick was a man of mercurial tem perament and unusual activity, who as soldier, lecturer, politician and diploma tist held a position of considerable prom inence before the American public for twenty years. The portion of his varied and somewhat dramtic career which will be longest remembered is that which The message of President Arthur is admirably written, calm and dignified in style and tone, and advises Congress, as it is his constitutional duty to do, on many important subjects with a wisdom and sound judgment which will win for him the public confidence and for his recommendations the attentive consider ation of both houses. N. T. Herald. Everybody will admit the president's message to be a business-like paper. That, however, is the faint praise which people are accustomed to bestow upon messages which are entirely pointless, and as President Arthur's message is by no means pointless, the stock phrase fails to do justice to it. N. T. World. The message is strongest on foreign relations and finance : but it is not weak anywhere, and it will be general ly accepted by the country as a judi cious, moderate and , in most respects, satisfactory document- -N. T. Tribune. The first message of President Arthur is a very careful and well-matured doc ument . Its tone is more frank and di rect than is customary , in such papers, and its recommendations, extensive and varied as they are, show that the presi dent has patiently reviewed the field of labor so recently and so unexpectedly opened before him, and that he is not inclined to shirk the constitutional duty of aiding Congress by his suggestions and advice. N. TV Times. The n;es3age is a well-written, business-like document, marked by the char acterestics that belong to Gen. Arthur himself. It is free from novelties and surprises, but is full of facts and sug gestions. President Arthur must have been devoting his days and nights, with indefatigable industry, to the study of the foreign and domestic business of the government during the 1 1 weeks that have passed since he became president. New York Sun. President Arthur's first annual mes sage will stand with the best of the 91 which have been made by his predeces sors. Presidential messages have latelv come to be mere summaries of depart ment reports. President Arthur's is not, and he has thrown about the entire instrument a dignified consciousness of his position as the head of a great na tion, which is as commendable as it is rare in these annual state papers. Philadelphia Press. The message of President Arthur will rank as an able and creditable state pa per. It is dircet; and clear in style, broad in its scope, patriotic in spirit, and, in the main, admirable in its rec ommendations. Boston Herald. The President writes like a scholar and a gentleman, and more like a train ed statesman than any president who has served a term since Lincoln. Boston Transcript. 

CONGRESS. Monday. The first regular session of the forty-seventh congress convened at noon. In the senate a large number of bills were introduced, among them one by Mr. Snerman, providing for the issuing of a three per cent, bond to be sold for legal tenders, the legal tenders to be used in retiring the three and a half per cents. The house was organiz ed by the election of J. Warren Keifer of Ohio as speaker, Edward McPherson of Pennsylvania as clerk, George W. Hooker of Vermont as sergeant-at-arms, W. P. Brownlow of Tennessee as door keeper, Henry Sherwood of Michigan as postmaster and Fred D. Power of Vir ginia as chaplain. Beyond the appoint ment of a committee to inform the pres ident of the organization, no business was transacted. Tuesday. Six senators were ap pointed upon the joint committee for the preparation of a memorial upon the death of President Garfield. Many bills of a private nature were introduced. The house was not in session. Wednesday. In the senate a large number of bills was introduced ; Mr. Morrill, 'of Vermont, made a speech upon the tariff; a bill was passed con ferring the franking privilege upon Mrs. Garfield. The house was not in session. Congress has adjourned until Tues day. It is clear that little business will be done before the holiday recess. Every year a few industrious members urge the lazy and procrastinating ma jority to go to work as soon the session begins, but the old custom of lounging away the time until after New-Year's Day it too strong to de broken. The three weeks before Christmas are of little account save to enable the mem bers to unload upon the committees the bills they bring to Washington. Gen. Keifer is speaker of the House. His speech as he took the chair was a surprise. Although no fine specimen of rhetoric or good writing was expected, still such a jumble of badly-expressed ideas and ungramraatical sentences was not anticipated from him. Keifer calls himself a self-made man, and he must have made his grammar. No notice was ever taken of the faults of his ex tempore speeches, but his friends did expect that he at least would put a plural verb to a plural subject when ' he put his sentence in writing. ' Keifer has many good traits. He is a hard work er, and a painstaking plodder. But he has a hard head. He has no quickness of perception. ; A bill or a motion whose purport Sunset Cox, or Randall, or Frye, or Robinson would see through almost instantly Keifer can only com prehend after long and patient study. He will dig at a subject until he has in a measure got an understanding of it. Such a gift of plodding is a blessing no doubt, but it doesn't avail much for the speaker of the House of Representatives. In that seat, if anywhere, the power in stantly to grasp a subject, the gift of quickness of thought, of instantaneous reasoning, the intuitive recognition of a a A? 1 ! 1 situation ana oi wnai ic requires trom a speaker gifts which Blaine possesses in such remarkable degree, these are absolutely necessary. Besides a speak er should at least have a fair knowledge of parliamentary law and have the rules and precedents of the House at the tip of his tongue. These rules and prece dents cannot be mastered as the rules of grammar can be. They must be learn cd by long experience. Many mistakes make the best teacher. Keifer last win ter attempted two or three times to take part in a parliamentary wrestle and in every instance he was sadly worsted The man who should have been selected, it merit deserved to be so honored, is Kasson, and there is not a member of the House on either side who knows anything about it, who does not admit it. Ihe stalwarts might have gone to Kasson instead of Keifer, had it not been rumored that Kasson was Blaine's choice. By and by the time wiil come when Randall and Cox and Carlisle will make trouble for Keifer. There are two or three men who aspire to be the leader of the House. Two of these members have some quali fications for the place ; one of them has none. Mr. Kasson will be respected. When he speaks he will be sure of hav mg listeners, tie win, whether recog nized as the leader of the House or not. wield a very large influence. He is un derstood to have come back filled with 1 t . i m mm M large ammtions to mate tor himseit a record, perhaps more as a statesman than as a leader. Kasson believes that this is to be largely a business Congress .aside irom tne contested election cases ne aoes not see now any measure or a very partisan nature can be brought to issue, at least at this session. He be lieves that the tariff question is going to assert itself, but that it will cause more dissension on the other side of the House than it will on the republican side. Kasson, therefore, expects to take an active part in legislation, Mr. Robeson also desires to be recog nized as a leader. He is not without some just claims for such recognition for a man so beefy in appearance and of so many physical indications of be ing a high liver indications which are said to belie him. He is a man of con siderable quickness of thought, a good speaker, rather convincing in his logic, although at times a little too much of the special pleader; has some knowledge of parliamentary law, considerable tact, and, moreover, has won a good deal of popularity. He will nnquestionably be very prominent on the floor. It is doubtful whether he makes any mark as a legislator. The excitement of the floor, the inspiration which men of his mold get from 6uch surroundings as he finds there, the necessity for quick repartee, and for the mental activity which a give-and-take debate requires, make Mr. Robeson more at home on the floor and more influential there than he could possibly be in the committee-room where the legislation is really shaped The third aspirant for the post of leader will never secure that honor. refer to Representative Dudley C. Hask ell of the Lawrence district in Kansas, Haskell i3 a man of too much ability to make himself ridiculous. He is a stu dent, is regarded as an honest man, de cidedly bright, very quick to see a point and to know how to make the best use of it, equally rapid in discerning the motives of the other side, and equally fertile in resources for meeting these motives. He is a fairly good speaker, but he lacks just the one quality nec essary to fit him for leadership. He has no more personal magnetism about him than George F. Hoar. He attracts nobody and repels a good many, al though unintentionally. He does what a good leader never does, he sometimes bores the House, and be is utterly lack- who understands the rules of the House as not more than half a dozen do but they are perfectly at home in the modu3 operandi of introducing legisla tion and carrying it through the House. Randall has enemies in his own party and there are men jealous of him. Carlisle is respected by every man in the House, and Cox is popular. All three are watchful, not only of the gen eral interests committed to them, but of the interests of their party. Carlisle is one of the strongest men who have rep resented the democratic party in the House for years. He has the makings of a great statesman, and perhaps "by and large" is regarded as the most able man on the democratic side. Every one knows Randall's qualifications, and no one knows better than Sunset Cox that his reputation as a humorist and wit has shadowed much more sterling and bril liant qualities. With three such lead ers as these, and with the republican vote one less than a quornm, it will be impossible for very much legislation of a partisan nature to get on the statute books. THE 

MESSAGE. It turns out that about 1,000 people perished in the burning theatre at Vi enna, Austria, liy tne burning or a boarding house in Pittsburgh, Penn. 26 persons lost their lives, Tuesday night. As shown by records in the offices of New York Insurance companies, Gui teau, the murderer, and other members of the Guiteau family swear that there has never been insanity in the family.

JEXKINS 1 i8-50 A, d! MATHEWS, J Commissioners. STATE NEWS ITEMS. The first message of President Arthur to Congress is a weighty document It is not long but it is strong. In details, showing great comprehensiveness ; in lucid and vigorous statement, and in plainness and soundness of recommenda tion, it is difficult to see how it could be improved. It is a masterly State paper, and coming from a man new to his office and still within the shadow of a great calamity, it is plain that none other than a man of large ability and superior judgment could have prepared it It is another and a striking proof that President Arthur is meeting the high expectations of those who know him best. The first important recommendation of the message relates to the silver dol lar, of which seventy millions are piled up in the treasury vaults and uncalled for. The President recommends that the arbitrary coinage of two millions a month be stopped. Of kindred charac ter is the recommendation that the sil ver certificate be eliminated from the currency, and in this recommendation the President shows the radical sound ness of his financial views. The Presi dent sensibly advises no meddling with tho 3 1-2 per cent bonds, unless they can be refunded at a much lower rate of interest This indicates that Mr. Ran dall's three per cent bond is not wanted, in the opinion of the President. The message, in view of the large surplus revenues of the Government un hesitatingly commends a reduction in the internal revenue, restricting that branch of the government income to to' bacco and spirits, and the manufactur ers' and dealers license. The President weuld wipe out at once the tax on matches, proprietary articles, checks and drafts. The message also favors a revision of the tariff laws, but wisely suggests that changes should be made with caution. If this Congress has not time to attend to the subject, the Presi. dent recommends recourse to a commis' sion, such as is already proposed by measures before Congress. The recommendation of the Postmas ter-General that the fees tor money or ders not exceeding $5 be reduced from ten to five cents is tacitly approved. and also the suggestion that the maxi mum of the order be increased from $50 to $100. If doubt existed anywhere that the President means to follow up the stat-route frauds, it is removed by the pointed declarations of the message that the President has "enjoined upon the officials who are charged with the conduct of the cases on the part of the government and upon the eminent coun sel who. before mv accession to the presidency, were called to their assist ance, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost rigor of the law all persons who may be found chargeable wh frauds upon the postal service." Many other topics are forcibly and luminously discussed by the message. Altogether it is an admirable, business like and statesman-like paper, sure rank among the best Exchange. "Washington dispatches report Senator Edmunds as suffering severely from neuralgia. A Waterbury dispatch says that Charlie Jackman, aged 13, was drowned while skating on Butler Pond. The rush of freight over the Central keeps up. From three to five specials are run each, way daily, and there would be more if cars were plenty. St. Albans Butter Market, Dec. 6.
