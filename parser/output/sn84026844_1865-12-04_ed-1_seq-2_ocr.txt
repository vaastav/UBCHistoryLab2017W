CAMPBELL & M'DEBMOT EDITORS AND PROPRIETORS. MONDAY *OESIS?, DEC. 4. Congress assembles to day at 12 o' clock, M. As usual the 14 rest interest centers in the lower House. There is now no longer a doubt that it will be organiied without delay. Mr. Colfax will be chosen Speaker without opposi tion, and Mr. McPherson is almost equally sure of re-election as clerk. Nothing will be done to-day, we sup pose, but to effect an organization and appoint the usual committees to wait upon the President and apprise him of the organization and readiness to re vive the message. We trust and believe that Congress will take firm ground in regard to the admission of the members from the rebel States. We are sure the loyal people of this State expect their repre sentatives and Senators there to reftise admittance to men from States which o in not be trusted to hold elections, ex opt under guard of federal bayonets. In view of the momentous questions of domestic settlement and pacification, no less than of foreign complications, to come up for adjustment this winter, the country looks to the present Con gress with anxious interest, and fer vently hopes it will be equal in pru dence nnd statesmanship to the great demands that are 'soon to be made upon it. We shall be surprised if the copper heads are not also greatly disappointed in President Johnson's forthcoming message. The Attorney tteneralshtp. The Inst issue of the Morganton Post, referring to the vacancy that will be occasioned in the oflice of Attorney General by the election of the incum bent to the Judgeship of the Tenth Cir cuit, suggests for a temporary appolnt m nt, ?nd as a candidate at the election when held, to fill the vacancy, the mime or Edward C. Bunker, Esq., of that place. 11 is unfortunate that this vacancy occurs just as it does; for the law is direct and explicit in requiring an elec tion in a limited time to fill it; and to hold an election all over the State for choice of this single officer, would sub ject the people to a heavy expense and un amount of trouble which It is desir able to avoid. In view of this consideration we have looked u little into the law to see whether it would not permit the election for Attorney General to reach over to the regular Spring election in April. We find that uuder the law of February 3, 1965, Judge Hall has sixty days with in which to accept his commission and qualify; because this law, being sweep ing in its provisions and of a later date, repeals the provision of the general election law which would otherwise re quire him to euter on the discharge of his duties in ten days. The Attorney Generalship does not become vacant till Mr. Hall nccepts his commission by qualifying as Judge. This he may do m.s late as the 21st of January. Within ten days thereafter the Governor Is re quired to issue his proclamation ap pointing a day for holding the election, not more than sixty days distant. This would carry the election over to the rst day of April,?still some three week* short of the regular Spring elec tion. We are not advised whether Governor lloreman contemplates ordering the apecial election, as a strict construction ??f the law requires, or will feel author lied to postpone it till the April elec tion. We believe the real Interests of the State would be promoted by the postponement, and have no doubt the people generally would prefer it. A s|?ecial election throughout the State, for a single officer, in the middle of winter, is not to be desired, and would cost much more than the Interests of the State would suffer by three or four week's longer vacancy?seeing that, the Governor has authority to employ counsel, should counsel be needed, to protect the interests of the State during the vacancy. We see. by a proclamation from Gov ernor Roreman, that he has declared Kphraim It. Hall, the present Attornev General of this State, to be duly elected Judge of the 10th Judicial Circuit of West Virginia. We have not seen it stated how be reconciled the rejection of the large number of votes in several precincts,^ which we alluded to last week.?Kanawha Republican. We rcspectfullv suggest to our hyper- \ critical cotemporary that Gov. IJore- j man did his exact duty under the 35tb i section and the sixth paragraph of the 30th section, of the general elec tion law. We would add that if the papers con- i ducted in the interests of the returned ! rebels would inculcate obedience to the j laws instead of resistance to their en fjrvemont, we should not have occasion to regret such shameful conduct as they were guilty of In some sections of the State at the recent election. We believe the returned rebels would in general be have themselves, and shortly regain and deserve the contidence of loyal people if they were not instigated and encour aged to continue obstinRte traitors and defyers of law by such prints as the JtepubticuH has recently become. When ever the loyal people are satisfied that the returned rebels can be trusted with the privilege of the franchise, they will no longer withold it; but their conduct in the recent election was not calculated to inspire any such confidence. We would also respectfully suggest to that class of persons, and to their newspapers and attorneys, that the game of bluff once so potent has lost its terrors in this latitude. Amendment to Ihr State Constitu tion. The Point Pleasant Remitter says that ??our Legislature this n inter will be j composed largely of amendment men, and the few Butternuts who are op poo ed to this measure will hare but little show. We have no doubt that the amendment will be passed by this body by a large majority." Wo may ndd that what the Legislature ; does iu that direction this winter the people will ratify next fall. JrroB Harrison, of the 11th Circuit1 of West Virginia, who was prcaent at the hearing of th? motion of Win. A. Quarrier, to beadmittod to the bar, and who was observed to listen with appa rently great interest to the argument, has returned to his circuit, and has ad mitted his entire bar to qualify, without requiring them to take the test oath.?

M The nwllnff on ftatanUy Last la Ref erence to the Organisation of a Board or Trade. [For the Intelligencer.] Pursuant to a call of the merchants and business men ot the city of Wheel ing, * meeting was held at Wash ington Hall on Saturday afternoon, December 2d, 1865, to take Into consid eration the organization of a Board of Trade, and on motion of Mr. E. M. Norton, Dr. T. H. Logan was appointed President pro tem., and Mr. Wm. Q. Battelle. Secretary pro tem. The President pro tem. briefly ex plained the object of the meeting and I urged upon those present the import j ance of organizing a Board of Trade, but that we should know what we want ed to do at the start; there being several , other important meetings called at the same hour, he thought that it might be j well to adjourn until next Saturday, when a larger attendance might be ; obtained. Mr. M. Reilly thought the attendance respectably large and was in favor of immediate organization. He had been J a member of the former Board of Trade 1 of this citv, and while some persons ! thought its efforts had not amounted to 1 much, he pointed with pride to our : Suspension Bridge as one of the results of the efforts of that body. He thought the number present sufficiently large to ! put the project in motion. Mr. II. Darlington also favored im mediate action. The attendance was not so large as it might be, but in every important movement some few persons were obliged to take the initiatory, and j he therefore moved that a committee of Ave be appointed to report, at a future meeting, a plan for the organization of a Board of Trade. Carried. j Mr. Jos. D. DuBois moved that the ' President pro tem appoint the commit j lee after the meeting adjourn. Car ried. Mr. M. Rielly moved that when the ; committee were ready to report a plan I of organization, the Secretary pro tem. should notify the merchants and busi ness men of the city, through the city papers, of the place and hour for meet ing. Carried. After some further remarks from the gentlemen present, on motion the rneet . ing adjourned. The following named gentlemen were -pointed a committee of five for the stated: Metcalf, L. S. Delaplain, H. Dar j llngton, John Donlon, H. K. List, j T. H. Loo an. Pres't pro tem. Wm. G. Battkllk, Sec'y pro tem. j The Wheeling Intelligencer wants | to know "If any gold has been discov j ered in this vicinity." Tbe mineral wealth of our county has not yet developed itself to a great extent, yet we have uo doubt but there is gold here in abundance. Oil indications are good, and all that is necessary it* for some enterprising company to take the matter in hand, sink a well and there is no question but they will "see signs." In our region, we have hoop-poles, tan-bark, rail timber and, in fact, all j kinds of "mountain produce," and "other articles, too tedious to mention." Don't vot? think, Mr. Intelligencer, that we should have the Capital 7-.Si.j tersvtlle Argus. Yes, certainly, "the capital" to de velop "the mineral wealth" of your : county which "has not yet developed itself"?and can hardly be expected to I do so. That is just what is needed all I over the State. As to the "hoop-poles, . tan bark and rail timber," they are very useful articles in their place, but have no special adaptation to the erec tion of public buildings or carrying on the different departments of govern ment. How the Fenian "Head 4'entre** in Ire land was Arrested. "Head Centre" Stephens, the reputed leader of the Feuian movement in Ire land, for whose capture a reward of two hundred pounds was offered by the government, was arrested, with three men, named Kickham, Brophy and Duffy, in a cottage at Sandsmount, about two miles from Dublin, on the 11th inst. The Dublin Evening Mail says the circumstances under which the arrests took place were as follows: "For some time past suspicion has attached to Fairfield, on account of a sort of mystery attaching to its occu pants. Tbe police were accordingly directed to keep a watch upon it. In consequence o! information which had reached the detective department a few days since, Dawson proceeded toinquire into the matter. On the 10th, he satis lied himself that the party who give his . name to Mr. Halbert, the landlord, was no other than Stephens, for whom the police have been so long upon the watch. He at once returned to town and swore an information before Mr. Stronge. "Upon this a search warrant was is sued, but it was determined to delav its execution until next morning, when the force under the command of Colonel Lake, commissioner of police, and Mr. Superintendent Ryan, proceeded to the house. Stephens 'himself came to the back boor on hearing the knock. He asked, 'Who is there; is that Corrigan?' j alluding to a gardener whom he employ ed. The officers answered, 'We are j police, with a search warrant.' He then said, 41 can't let you in; 1 am undressed.* ! They replied, 'If you do not open the j door we will force it.* Thereupon he i opened the door. He was in his shirt, and immediately proceeded up-stairs to dress, the officers follow ing closely. In his bed room were found his wife and her younger sister. Miss Hopper, who said, 4Here are the bloodhounds after us.* "In this room were found some memorandum books and other docu ments, including a number of receipts from a respectable cabinet-maker and upolsterer, for payment on account of articles of furniture supplied to the house; in a recent instance no leas a sum than .?140 appeared to have been paid. On the sill of a small window which lighted an apartment adjoining tbe b*d room, and which commanded the entrance gate, the officers found a case containing two loaded revolvers, i with amuuition and all neceasarv ap pliances, the property of Stephens. On entering another room thev found, in bed together, Brophy and Duffy, whilst Kickham slept on the door. Her** thev discovered two revolvers, capped anil loaded. "The pi Loners wet ? a!'searched. wh?n ' upon Stephens was fouud the sum oi upon Kickham, ?40 in coin, ?33 in notes, and a check for ?40; and upon Duffy an order, dated Ketr York. j September, lft?, for the snm of fi -w t Jfc. 6d., payable to Geoiye Hooper. The ! prisoners conducted themselves quietlv, and after the search had concluded thev were conveyed to the Lower Castle yard, where the charge of high treason was formallv preferred against them. On being asked their names thev gave them as follows: James Power alias Stephens. Fairfield, Sandymount. gen tlemen, Hugh Francis Brophv.22 Frank ford avenue, Rathtr.tr. builder; Charles J. Kickham, Mullinahone. county of Tippers ry, gentlemen, and Edward Duffy. Ballaghadereen, county of Mayo, i draper. The prisoners were all rvspec-' tably attired?Stephens particularly so. i the neatness of his drau being Verv 1 marked." * ! ? Mr. Seward's first Knowledge of thk Death of Lincoln.?Mr. Seward had been kept in ignorance of the at- j tack on the President, his physician fearing that the shock would be too great for him to bear, and all news papers were rigidly excluded from his room. On the Sunday following his assassination the Secretary had the 1 bed wheeled around so that he could j see the tops of the trees in the park op-! poedte,ju?t putting on the spring foli-' age when his eyes caught the stars snd j stripes at half mast on the War Depart- j ment on which he gszed awhile, then '> turning to his attendant, said: "The ' President is dead 1" The confused at tendant stammered and changed color, as he tried to say nay, but the sagaci I ous old man said: "If he had been I alive he would have been the first to call on me; but he has not been here, ; nor has he sent to know how I am, and - there's the flag at half mast." The old . statesman's inductive reason had told the truth, snd he 1st in silence, the great tears conning down his gashed cheeks, as tbe dreadful truth sank into his mind. Great Gold Discovery. Colonel Inslee, of St. Joseph, now in Montana Territory, in a letter to hi* fbmily, Incloses the following extract from the Virginia City (Montana) Pott, of November 4th, relative to some new ly discovered mines, which bid fair to surpass in richness anything heretofore known in the world. Colonel Inslee , writes that he has seen some specimens of the quartz from these mines, which I seemed to be "nearly solid gold." Here is the extract from the Ft>tU?{Mi&touri | Democrat.] 1 "Upon the arrival of the Helena stage, last Friday morning, the people of Virginia city were thrown into a gold excitement, before which all former ex 1 citements were pale. The facts, as we get them from apparently well autben ' ticatedsources, are briefly as follows: "Mr. Brown, a German orNorwetran, and one of the original discoverers of the celebrated GoudCarry lode, of Nevada, and afterwards of Brown lode in Nelson Gulch, in this Territory, was engaged in finking a shaft on theJ'Ln cle Sam" lode, about the head of Dry Gulch, some four miles from Helena. He had sunk near twenty feet, when, the indications not suiting him, he con cluded to change his course by drifting up hill from the bottom of his shaft. He advanced in this direction about ten feet, when he reached a gold deposits which, in richness and extent, has, per haps no parallel in the history of gold mining. Gold, in almost solid masses, glittered before his bewildered vision. Kor two weeks longer, unknown tooth ers, he tunnelled into the golden Secreted about him, he had accumulated several gunnyrsacks, literally tilled with the precious metal, when longer secrecy became impracticable, from the very extent of his unexpected wealth, and" Mr. Brown proceeded to record and secure his property, when the public were informed of the great discovery. It is said rhat he now keeps a strong guard, night and day,over hisseeming lv incomputable wealth, while he hiui selve, unassisted, delves into the golden walls around him, and continues mul tiplying his sacks of precious ore. One person who was admitted into Mr. Brown's drift, states that it presented a scene of wealth more akin to a picture of the imagination than actuality. Gold! gold! gold! met the view on every side ? above, below and all around?and re flected back its rich hues in the glare of the candle, as if this subterranean vault had been hewn out of a solid ledge of the vellow metal. "This gold is found in a well defined ledge, fully five feet in width. The gold vein is three feet wide?three-fourths ol the entire substance therein being pure gold; the remainder mainly bismouth. On each side of this vein there is a i casing of one foot of quartz, which will ? assay from $400 to ?!,0U0 to the ton. The i very wall-rock is rich. Specimens can ! be seen at the City Book Store. ! "Whether this is, to use familiar min | ing terms, a 'blow-out' or a 'pocket,' we are not prepared to admit or deny. But be it either, millions are 'lying around loose.* We can scarcely realize that this is a distinct, continuous ledge, as, in that case, so vast an amount of i gold would affect the standard of gold valuation throughout the commercial world. But our informant, whom we know to be a man of reliability, assures us that a distinct ledge has been traced fully seventy-five feet." In Memoriiuu. : At a meeting of the members of Com panv H, lyoth Regiment O. V. I., held j in Alexandria, Va., November 28th, , 1865, Captain James H. Prentiss was called to the Chair, and Li^ut. Thomas A. Mellor appointed Secretary. Erskine j M. Hamilton, Wm H. Caldwell and Al : bert H. Black, being appointed a Com mittee to draft resolutions, presented ; the following to the meeting, which } were unanimously adopted: i Whereas, Almighty God hss seen : fit, in the mysterious workings of His Providence, to remove from our midst i our beloved comrade, Edwaid Bynon, late a member of tnis company, we deem it tit that we should express our sense of the loss we have sustained.? ; Therefore, be it Re?olved, That it is with the most un ' feigned sorrow we have heard of the ? death of our brother soldier, Edward ? Bynon, late member of the company.? | Iii his death, we feel that we have lost a I comrade indeed; that we have lost a ge i nial companion, a sincere friend, a good Iand worthy soldier; one who endeared himself to all with whom he came in contact by bis high social qualities, noble thoughts and generous impulses. Although his bright face and cheerful i smile is gone, we know and feel that he is not dead, but still liveth. lietolved, That we deeply sympathize with the family and relatives of the de j ceased in this*great sorrow which has come upon them, and we can only ex tend to them that sympathy, deep and heartfelt, in the loneliness of their be reavement, when we feel "that he is gone." The tear-drop falls from manly eyes. From eyes that ne'er shed tears before, i As cold in death before us lies The comrade ol the days of yore. Resolved, That a copy of these reeolu-1 ; tions be sent to the family: also, to the ? Steubenville Herald and Wheeling In- ; | telligeneer, lor publication. Capt. J. H. Prottss, Chairman. Lt. T. A.
