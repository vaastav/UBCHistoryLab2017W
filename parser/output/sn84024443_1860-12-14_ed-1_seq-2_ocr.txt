The Crlsis-What Ought We to Do? The Governor of Tenneaaee has issued hi Proclamation, convening tha Lcgisln lure on the 7th of January next, - A large n limber of our loading And influential citizens, in different parte; of the Stale, are of opinion thnt this is the first ttep to be tnken in the present perilous condition of public affair. If it is desired thnt the people of the State sli nl I manifest their opin ions in regard to those nfl'uirs, then this is the only legnl mode in which their opin ions mny be made known not by any ac tion of the Legislnture in giving utterance to facts, sentiments or opinions, but by tha pnssngo of n law authorizing a Con vention of delegates, elected by tho peo ple through the ballot box, whose duty it ahull be to asscmhlo together at ft stated time for the purpose of giving utterance to th will of the people. TheOoveriior having decided to cull the Legislature together, the question now is, what is the duty of the members of thnt body in view of the alarming condition of the country ? We do not hesitate to sny that a Convention should he called at once a Convention of the people of the State by delegate elected from each county, and that arrangements should bo made for the assembling of that Conven- tion at the earliest da.v practicable. Tlw by resolution or otherwise as to the que' tion arising out of the present stoto of the country, it would only be the individ unl opinions of the gentlemen composing thnt body. The introduction of "Resolu tions' therefor, and the consequent dis cussion thereupon, would only have the eflect to prolong the session, without ef fecting nnv practical result. Let the members meet together in n spirit of am ity and conciliation eschew all hitter discussion, nil crimination and re-crimination, forbear to inquire into the causes of our political troubles, but simply to perform such acts in their capacity ns law makers as will result in such a Conven tion of the people, referring tho discus sion of the whole subject to that Conven tion, nnd then adjourn again to their homes. Having pursued this course, the mem bers of the Legi-laturo will have perform ed ft practical servico to the country, nnd the responsibility will rest where it prop erly belongs, under this Government of ours, upon the peoplo themselves the source of nil political power. And a sol emn responsibility it will be upon tho people, when tney como to look at the subject practically. Tennessee will then bo culled upon to speak out in terms which will be unmistakable. It will be no mere State Convention of party men for tho adoption of mere parly platfoinis nor will their nqtia vi bo the mere ebulli tion of feeling, or sentiments, of nn irre sponsible body. But it will be the organ ized action of a sovereign State, upon the most momentous questions ever presented lo their consideration. It mny be that tho action of Tennessee will determine, for weal or woe, tho happiness nnd pros perity, not only of her own people, but of the nation at large. In view of the great results depending upon her notion, tho Stato should be represented in the Con vention by her wisest, most conservative and most sagacious men. What lino of policy should be inaugurated by the Con vention, it would bo impossible now to define. Events follow each other in such rapid succession, that it is impossible ono week to foretell what the next may bring forth, or to say at this early day what should bo the policy or measures to be adopted upon the assembling of a Con vention t'.vo months henco. The grand idea, however, which should bo constant ly kept in view, is the adoption of such measures as will best preserve the Union and we mean the entire I'm'on which we bcliovo can only bo done by that policy which will maintain the safety nnd preser vation of the institutions of the South. Tho North must be made to feel hor de pendence upon the South nnd must bo made to feci that tho South is a unit and will demand her just and Constitutional rights otherwise there is no settlement of this controversy. What that demand will be what ultimatum nhull beprescntod to our Northern brethren, will be subjects to be decided by the Convention. It should be firm and decided, otherwise it will not reach tho end proposed, and we have every confidence, under tho bless ings of heaven, thnt the North will yield to that demand. Otherwise wo can Bee nothing else but that the Union is lost, bringing in its train all its attendant un certainties in the future. In our opinion the North will yield any reasonable guaranty, rather than be sepa rated from the South and we now think that is the only way by which the Union can be saved. Boston Custom House.

Important Proceedings of tho South ern Caucus in Washington. WastiiMoTOV, Dec. 9, 1800. . Secretary Cobb has completed his let ter to the people of Georgia, nnd It will be mails publio in a day or two. Ho avow the most ultra sentiments, and coin the idea that any compromise or adjustment can be made with Iho North, lie disc.issea nt great length the issues involved in tho struggle between tho North and the South, nnd maintains the clear and unquestionable right of a. Shite lo sccode. 1 1 is views are diametrically op posed to thoso of the President, so much so, indeed, Hint the moment they arc published he will ho compelled to retire from tha Cabinet. He is in daily expec tation of intelligence from his State that he has been nominated as a candidate for member of the convention, The moment he receives despatches to thnt ell'eet he will leave for (ieorgin nt once. The great importance of tho caucus of Southern Senator has induced me to fol low it up. Its action settles the question so far a the South is concerned. It was attended by nil Hie Southern Senators in the city excepting lverson. Ho was invited, but refused to attend. Breckin ridge was also present. Its deliberations j wore grave and dignified, nnd the do ' bites exceedingly ablo and interesting, I but no pTTrTwvniwa-of Onngresstonal nation was agreed upon, or indeed seriously uracil. j Senatois from States where the Lcgis- , latnros. have been railed, or conventions ordered to consider the present position of federal all'.iirs, held that tho subject had been "taken out of their hands, and were quite unwilling to commit them selves to any course of action in Congress. They said no enrthly power could arrest the tide of dissolution, and that the only question to be considered is one of re construction. With them the proposition of Senator Fowcll, to raise a select com mittee, met with no fuvor. It is even doubtful if any one of them would con sent to servo on such committee. The right of secession seemed to be nl most unanimously conceded in the caucus, nnd the doctrine of coercion ns generally repudiated. Indeed, it is not certain that nny Senator, except Crittenden, dis sented from these views, nnd even he did not think coercion wise or practicable. It was in this regard that the action of South Carolina was considered so poten tial. Sho was determined to go out, nnd when out the other fourteen slavehold ing Stales were committed to maintain her. Whether her action was wiso or un wise, they held it to be right, .and they would not stand by and see war waged on her for the exerciso of thnt right, though an impolitic step for herself. Thus, it was held, if South Carolina goes out she must bo treated as rightfully out of the Union, nnd permitted to remain out, else war between tho slave-holding and the non-slaveholding State must fol low. But South Carolina nee I not go out alone. Ono of the most conservative nnd intelligent members of the caucus slated to-day that the developments had con vinced him thnt disruption to tli eytpot of five, If not seven States, before the 18th of January, was inevitable, nnd thnt no thing that can bo done in Congress will arren the disaster. The great effort now among the South ern men is to get together nnd to induce all the States to net together, in order that they may be able to command such new guarantees for their rights as arc necessary in case of reconstruction, or to be able to tuko enro of themselves if it bo determined thnt the free and nhivo States must separate forever. Thi new nnd important nnd formnl programme has been presented for tho consideration of the Southern Senators, and was talked over in their caucus. It emanate from Lamar, the able represen tative from Mississippi. The first object is to get tho cotton States to postpone final action so as to give time to tho other Southern States to co-operato with them. The plan is to havo all the Southern States in separate conventions nt the same time, and to adopt the present gov ernment of the United States at first, without any alterations ; to provide or the execution of all grants and treaties, and for the general and poaceablo opera tion of all tho machinery of the prosent government, even nfter several States had solemnly withdrawn from the Union, and invito all the other States to join with them, with the hope that New Kngland will stay out. The first feature in the programme is to have all the Southern States in separate convention at the same timo, and have such perfect understanding thnt they should on the samo day adopt tho same ordinances vcrlathn ct literatim. Second, that such ordinances, whilst severing in a solomn way the bonds which unito the said States to tho United States of North America, shall provide that the constitution and laws of the United States shall remain in full force and ell'eet amongst the seceding States, and thut the prosent constitution shall be their constitution and compact. Third, that the law and decisions of courts which are now of force in the re public of the United Slates of North America, under the authority of the gov ernment thereof, shall be adopted a a body of laws for the federal government of this, the United States nf Iho South. fourth, that the people of these Uni ted States South do heroby bind them selves to observe and soundly and sacred ly curry out. tho stipulations of all trea ties subsisting between the United Stnlee of North America and foreign govern ments anterior to tho date of this ordi nance, until such treaties are changed or altered, or are disregarded by such nation with this government. Filth, that the following persons are hereby appointed electors for the State of ami are nereuy authorized and empowered to cost the vote of this State. on such day as may be agreed tijion, for President and Vice President of the Uni ted Mates South ( and such person a may receive the highest number of votes, according to the constitution which has been re-adopted, ahull be elected and in augurated, ued invested with the powers conferred by the tame constitution upon the Executive, on the twertieth day af ter the adoption of thi ordinance. Sixth, that the eonventiona are to pro vide for nn immediate convention of a Congress of the United State South, eitiier appointed by themselves or author ising the present representative to act, and that all otlicers, mail oontroetoia, marshal and judge shall leUiin their otticca until otherwise ordered. Secretary Floyd's Letter. Uiehmmid, 1 w.,' Don. 0. I n response to ft request of Katlmn Tyler, Secretary Floyd bus written a 'lotter-to the Enquirer, giv ing his views jit length on the present stnto of niruifn in the Union.

Speaking of slnverv ngitation he ssysi This ngilalion which has been so ling and wantonly persisted in by Northlrii men, bus produced the seetionnl nlejmtion which is about to llnd its nntiral rosult in the destruction of n Conlediincy that was voluntary in its origin, Biil enn only bo perpetuated by the voluntary assent of its members. Again, shaking of tho rights of Stnlcs to secede, lio says; Tho States of the South hav a right to secede, not only from tho vci nature of the Federal compact, but- by an express resetvation on the part cLsorue of them nt tho time of entering into the Confederacy. Of tho cresiiit dancer he savs: The great danger f the present crisis exists in tho fact tl in our country nil pohti a popular movement, and eal action is I all popular ru incuts, liming the period ot angry exc pint, nre lrom the nature nil extreme; the ililli- of things, ul cultv ot net latini! the dill'erenees of tho two on while the present animosities , is ttieretoro almost inrturmw Hm flection ra -f.fis Lincoln violent esult of tho ultra and feeling of tho North against tlioNmtli. Hn disunion, besays: "I am not for secession ns long ns nny honorable eilort can be made to preserve tho Union on n constitutional basis, guaranteeing equality, justice and pro tection to the negro property of the South." In regard lo both sections, he says: "I believe, however, that the great material interests of the country de mand n reconciliation of the sections nnd the preservation of the Union, nnd I rely upon tho slow but certain, the si lent but jtotential inllnenccs of this great ngoney to bring about the settlement of our present troubles. The main struggle of nil should he to prevent a collision be tween tiie sections, and most especially the shclditig of the first blood. If wocan but succeed in averting these calamities, the grent practical business in terests of the country, mny, perchance, sooner or later, bring about a reconstruc tion of tho Union and restoration of hnrmory between tho sections. After this shi.il be done, who can doubt that a returning sense of confidence w ill be felt by the injured nnd exasperated South, nnd that peace nnd Union will bo re stored. Mr. Floyd says that twenty-five years moie oT Union and harmony will concentrate the commercial power of the world in the harbor of New York then the decline of Knglnnd becomes us cer tain ns was that of Alexandria nnd Venice, nn 1 for the snmo cause. Instead of the first she becomes n third rate pow ei, but lot disunion take place, let civil war and discord distract this country, and Engla id well knows that tho ships of tho North must rot nt their wharves, and the b;iy hum of the manufactories must cease forever, then would Kngland feel again that sho was mistress of the seas without a rival, secure in a com merce which no power could never shake her in. Mr. Flovd expresses his own opinion as follows: The South can never count upon tho friendship of England nnd of her tolerating evils not her own ; once with in the reach of her power, she will fix upon us forever tho very bnilgn of inferi ority wJiieUwe are ready to destroy the Union for. -To sacrifice tho interests of a class, or even to starve to death a few hundred thousand of her subjects in what she considers a laudable task, will constitute a very small obstnelo in her policy. It is a fata! error to suppose that the interests of England would prompt hor to foster the planting interests of the South. It is known that the Prince Con sort sat silently by and witnessed the deliberate insult of the American Min ister, Mr. Dnllus, by a British Peer, be fore tho congregated intelligence of all Christendom, simply because slavery ex isted in the United States. There is not nn Englishman who docs not in his heni t abhor slavery, if ho does not also abhor Iho country where it ex ists. Kngland will have margin enough to supply her wants in cotton. Mr. Floyd deprecates the present stnto of ntlairs, and favors a State Convention. From Washington. Washington, Dec. 10.

But this supremo and irresistible power to make or unmake resides only in the whole (W of the people, not in any tut- tlivition of them.

No ono hns claimed north Carolina or Louisiana. orTexas. or Arkhn sns, or nny of (ho border State, ns bo longing to tho ilisunioiiisls. if there bn nny secession, it can hardly embrace any hut the live Miates we nave eniiiiieriiien, These five contained at the time of the Inst ccnus-nnd the population has not materially incrensedsinee then I.oCm, 570 whit people: rather more than the pop ulation of the Duchy of Buden. but les than that of Hanover, or Saxony, or Wiirlembers, or Tuscany, or the kingdom of Denmark. Numerically considered, the new Southern republic would be about half o important a State as Canada, nnd one third n powerful ns Mexico, nrea, however, would be vnt not loss thnn 24.'l,141 square miles about the same ns thnt of the empire of Austria, conslder nbly larger thnn Hint of Frnnce, and twieo ns large us Unit rif tho kingdom oT Great Britain and Ireland. This exten sive territory would prove both an ml-vnnrfttsW.a.ne-arrtheu ' Am iidvontiiirn. iTecn'iise it would firovent pnupWrdom, and, with proper systems of cultivation, would enable the citizens of the Southern republic to become generally prosperous, nnd even rich. But n burthen, ulso, be cause it would vastly increase the cost ol their naval, military and revenue servico. A very large force would have to be kept under nrms to prevent smuggling, nnd to keep in check abolitionist enterprises from tho North; beside which, the prospect of hostilities with tho United States would oblige tho new nntion to establish ut once tho nucleus of a power- tin nrmy. vt e hnve always been nolo to dispenso with an army, beeauso there hns never been a Power on this continent formidable enough to bo feared. In the event of secession both sections would necessarily be forced to prepare for the contingency ot war. It would, therctore, be absolutely necessary for the new na tion lo set about building a navy and mustering an army as soon ns its sepnrnto national existence was acknowledged. Under tho circumstances, it is not likely that the expenses of its government would be less than 940,(1(1(1,1100 'n year to begin with rather more than half that of the United States, France or England. This would compel tho l,;Vi,070 white inhabitants of the new nation to tax themselves in some shapo or other for the support of theii government, at the rute of about $2) a hend per annum. It is possible that this might be found an onerous tax, especially ns besides this, the judicious government of the slave population under the new regime would involvenn additional increase of expense. Certainly, in comparison with what, is paid by the people of other nations, the above sum though no exaggeration seems quite large. At present the people of the United States pay about SJ per head per annum for the support of their government: the people of England S4, fO, or thereabouts; the people of Franco aliout 25 : the peoplo of Spain about ?4; the people of liussin about ?l 80.
