SALT TARIFFS. The KaiuM Railroad Commissioner Ad just the Rates. TorEKA, Kan., Dec. S. The Bail road Commissioners have rendered their decision in the matter of the com plaint of the Board of Trade and salt producers of Kingman of unfair dis crimination in railroad rates on salt. The Board, after reviewing the facts in the case, say: "We are of the opinion that the salt tariffs to local points need revision in the interest of all those concerned. But this involves so many adjustments, not only as it respects the salt interests, but as well those that concern the car riers, that its final consideration will be entered upon at another time, and further notice to parties iu interest. "Upon the complaint before us we find and decide that the rate on salt from Kingman, Anthony and Welling ton should be the same to all Missouri river points as the rate on liko com modities from Hutchinson, Nickerson and Sterling, and the board directs and orders that such rates be made uniform from all the points above named. "Tl Vx-ra olBO na tK tlmo ol used in the manufacture of salt is slack coal supplied from the coal mines of Southeastern Kansas. The cost of this per ton delivered at Wellington is $2.45, and the freight rate is $1.70; at King man, 82.G5, and the freight rate $2; at Anthony $2.75 per ton, and the freight rate $2, and Hutchinson $2.40 per ton and freight rate $1.80. We think that in justice to so"important an industry as the salt manufacture in this State a concession should be made on these rates as follows: "Bate on coal slack to Wellington $1.30 per ton and to all the other points of salt manufacture in the State SI .50 per ton. And believing under existing circumstances that theso rates would be fair and reasonable the board or ders and directs that these rates on coal slack, together with uniform rates on salt to Missouri river points, 'be adopted and made effective upon all railroads operating to any of the points named by December 15, 1SS9."

MONEY SAVED. What the Missouri State Board Has Saved to the People. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8.

Ac cording to the decision tho coal rate was reduced from 55 to 35 cents per ton. Mr. Downing claims that the State Raihoad Commissioners have saved the people millions of dol lars since the body was called into ex istence. As to the effect of Missouri river transportation upon freight rates he was not prepared to talk, but thought the importance of the enter prise has been greatly overrated.

About this time C. R. Weatherby, a relative and warm friend of Judge Kel ler, appeared upon the scene and with pistol in hand opened fire on Pope. The excitement at this time can bo bet ter imagined than described. Major James Turner fell early in the action, but on examination his wound proved to be only a flesh wound of the abdo men. W. II.
