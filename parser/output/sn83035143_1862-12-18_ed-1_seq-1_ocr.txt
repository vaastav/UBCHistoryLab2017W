Old Nero, fiddling while Rome was burning, was a monk to our Daris, the king of the traitors accursed. On with the danee. Bring him more wine, more jolly boon companions, mora trophies of the fight. Let the shriek of the shell be as music to bis ears, and the crunching of bones chime with the clinking of his glas ses. Let him dabble in the blood of his country, and wrap his Stars and Bars around him as he reels into the banquet hall of his master, where his companions in the dance will be the demons before him who seceded from Hearen into Hell. The Right Kind of a Letter. Some months ago, a lad who was a pu pil in the Seminary at Williamsport, Penn syWania, enlisted and came to the West with the Anderson Troop. Being nnder age, his mother wrote whim to know if be desired her to commence proceedings with a Tiew to his discharge from the service, and received his answer, asking her to de sist from sooh undertaking, in these pa triotic words : E"You wish to know if I like the life. Certainly not I never expected to, but am much better pleased than I even anticipa ted. I did not enter the army because I thought I would like it, but enlisted simply out of a sense of duty. I am a Northerner by birth; all my interests in this world are there, and I was reared and educated nnder the American Sag. the glorious " old stars and stripes," and I could not stand as a casual witness ef the downfall of that flag without raising my arm in its de fense; I could not see our glorious Union totter and fall without rushing to its res cue. Ton had four sons, and out of those four I was the only one able to obey my country's call, the only one capable of de fending the rights of our Constitution and this is the reason I entered the army ; st do not again ask me if I like it, or if I want to be taken out at your commands." The Philadelphia Press says this young dragoon is a native of Harrisburg, where seme of bis kindred now reside, whilst many of his name sleep in the old church yard at Pazton, a historic spot, three miles from the capital of Pennsylvania. A Worthy Example for Young Ladies. The Wabash (Indiana) Express says an oil lady of that city, abont seventy years ef age, besides attending to all the domes tic duties of her household, bought the yarn and knit six pairs of excellent socks and three pairs of mittens, and sent them to the relief office, to be sent to our sol diers whenever most needed, remarking that if more yarn was furnished she would knit more socks and mittens. Such acta need no comment, further than it re minds our young ladies that much time is spent that might be well employed in knit ting a sock or mitten, which would make glad many a poor soldier during the win ter. General Dumont has ably refuted the charges of the Louisville Journal against him, through the columns of that paper. He shows that he was far away from the troops who surrendered at HarUville; that they had for some time been detached from the main body of his command, and also shows that tLe behavior of his sol diers in Kentucky was not disorderly, as had been asserted in the Kentucky papers. A Formidable Torpedo. A Washington dispatch says that the results obtained with a new torpedo, are described by those who hare witnessed the experiments, as being most extraordinary and unexpected. It is said that this last invention has been adopted by the Navy Department, and will immediately be in troduced into the service. At a long range, these terrible missiles will blow to atoms the strongest iron-clad vessel now float A horse is honored with an obit uary notice in a recent English paper. It appears that the oldest troop-horse in the British cavalry has just now departed this life. He was known of late years as Crimean Bob," and had been more than twenty-nine years in the serviee ; he went through the Crimean campaign, was in the battles Of Alma and Inkerman, and im tfae charge of Balaklava. He died from old age and decay, respected by all who knew him. Mexican Designs. It is stated that the project announced by the authorities of Mexico of flooding that city on the approach of the French, has excited a great deal of . indignation among the real estate owners and mer chants, who have entered a protest against such a resolution. The representative men of the Democra cy in Congress have introduced but two measures this session. The first is, to re duce the Federal tax on whisky to a nom inal rate, and the other is a bill to prevent the arrest of Northern traitors who are giving aid and comfort to the rebels. ' It is said that Burnside will not permit any army news to be hereafter telegraphed from the army without his endorsement Paper from Straw. ' The Xenia Torchlight gives the result of visit to the paper mills of Cincinnati and Dayton, as follows : "There is one mill in Cincinnati which makes a very fair paper from ordinary straw, and they can make it at a fair profit ior nine cents a poena, ne asked a manufacturer why other mills did not ro into that His answer was that the art of making it was a secret and patented that it would cost about ten thousand dollars to put np the necessary machinery and fix tures for it : that it would take at least six oaths' time, and that he hoped by that time rags would be down to the old price, When paper could be made as cheaply from rags as from straw. So that pretty effec tually disposed of our hope from straw pa per, as present relief." Oevelajiiil Meraii VOL. XVI. 

CLEVELAND, THURSDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 18. 1862. NO. 301. Paper from Straw. Arbitrary Arrests---Extract from Senator Fessenden's Speech. From the very able speech by Senator Fessenden, of Maine, upon the President's Message, we extract the following regard ing arrests by order of the President He said : " The President did not take an oath to support the Constitution. He takes an oath to 'protect, preserve, and defend the Constitution.' These are the words. Or dinarily all the other officers of the Gov ernment take an oath to support the Con stitution. But I shall not be put in the position of saying that therefore he has a right to violate it I say no such thing. What I do say is this, that it is his para mount duty to protect, preserve and de fend the Constitution, and if an occasion arises when in order to protect, preserve and defend that great instrument, without which the LI nion dies, he is compelled in his judgment to violate the rights of an individual citixen for a time, can any one Suppose that he ought to hesitate for a sin gle instant in doing so? I know gentle men appeal to that clause of the Constitu tion which say s no man shall be deprived of life and liberty or property without due process of law, and they infer that when the President arrests a man without due process of law,' that he is depriving him of liberty. Granted ; but suppose in his judgment and the judgment or all other men, the time arrives when some of the individual rights of the citizen snouid be violated for a time, in order to preserve the instrument itself, is it not the duty of the President at once to take that step? I think no man will dispute that. I put the question to my honorable friend from Kentucky (Mr. Powell.) who is one of the most amiable and best natured men in the world. I should judge, what he would do in a case, if there was no other mode in which he could prevent the commission or a great crime, which would be deadly, per haps, to the nation itself; and after a time, in which my friend exhibited great skim in fencing, he pretty much said he would not do such a thing if he was the Presi dent, I would not vote for him for Presi dent Let me put another question. Tou have no right, as a private man, to de prive any other man of liberty. But sup pose you had good reason to believe that ene of your neighbors intended to murder another, and there was no other way to prevent it, would you not put tne strong hand upon him, without due process of law ? " . . x - Mr. Powell Does the Senator want an answer now? Mr. Fessenden The Senator can do as he pleases. Mr. FoweU I can't' tell precisely wnat I would do. If I thought a man was about to assault a Senator, 1 would keep close to him, and if I saw any intimation or it, 1 Would seize him if I had the power, and I would even kill him before I would allow him to kill a Senator. Mr. Fessenden I think the Senator would venture a little further, and if he had a stontTope, I think he would tie him upon his own responsibility. Mr. F. then contended at some length that noonecould believe the President was not honest in his motives, that the people of the country did not believe it, and that it was his duty to act upon his belief when the life of the nation was at stake. Banks in North Carolina. t Ane luiiowiug is me iuii iexb oi uie uis- fcatch regarding tfco landing -of- Ranks in North Carolina. This report has been neither confirmed -nor satisfactorily con tradicted as yet: [Special Dispatch to the Philadelphia Press.] 

WASHINGTON, Sunday, Dec. 14. During the day the city was filled with rumors in regard to Banks' expedition. 8ome reported that it cad been landed at the head of York river, and all agreed that it had not gone south of Hatteras. t I have just received information from good authority that General Banks has landed with twenty thousand men at Win ton, North Carolina, near the headwaters of the Chowan river. , General Nathaniel P. Banks has assum ed command of the Army of the Black wa ter, consisting of three torpid armee, form ing a grand division of the army. - General Foster will command the left wing three divisions, forming a eorpi d armee. General Peck will command the right wing, forming a corps darnut of three di visions. ; General Augur will command the center corps of three divisions. Gen. Eweli will command the reserve troops, composed of twelve trusty regi ments, three batteries of artillery, and two squadrons of cavalry. - - Gen. Banks is already advancing, hav ing formed a junction with our troops at Suffolk. Gen. Foster's army has joined him by this time. : It may be that Weldon will be token im mediately, but Petersburgh must fall in a few days, while Burnside is driving Lee back upon Richmond, to receive the "last toes of the fork" from Gen. Banks as he en deavors to retreat to Lynchburg or Dan ville. .' .. . . . Gen. Banks has full possession of the Seaboard and Boanoke Railroad, and his future supplies will reach him by two oth er routes besides this one. i Thus far the movement may be consid ered a great success, and while its demor alizing sffuti apt the enemy will be very great, the effect upon the spirit of the Northern people will be most salutary. Lxpect stirring news from the Army of the Blackwater hourly. General Burnside Ruined in Business by the Villainy Floyd---His Honorable the Villainy Floyd---His Honorable Conduct. : The story of Burnside's honorable deal ings with his creditors, showing that the reliable, ambitious lad was the father of the honest man, we find thus told in Har per's Weekly: , " In '53 he resigned his rank in the army and devoted his time and energy to the manufacture of the famous rifle which bears his name.' When Buchanan was elected to the Presidency, his Secretary of War, Floyd, agreed with Burnside to arm a large portion., of the army with his rifle, and induced him to establish extensive factories for its manufacture. The works were no sooner completed 'than another gunmaker offered Floyd pecuniary in ducements to break his contract with Burnside,. who was ruined inconsequence. Assigning all his property to his creditors Burnside came to this city without a dol lar, sold his sword and uniform in Chat ham street, and went west in search of employment He found it in the office of the Illinois Central, where, as soon as his energies and capacities became known, he received -m salary of $2,000 a year. Of this sum he paid one-half regularly to his creditors, until, by the help of a timely legacy, he ' was enabled to liquidate his debts in full." George W. Phillips, of Company E, 105th Ohio, was admitted to Hospital No. 10, Louisville, December 12ti. 'Charles F. Bates,' Company f 105th Ohio, died in general hospital, at Louis ville, December 9 th.

[From the New York Post.] Some months ago we published an ac count of the romantic career and adven tures of Mr. E. Forester, a young man from one of the northern counties of this State, who, a few years since, went to China, as a sailor,and entering the Chinese service, rose to a high military rank. He became a Chinese mandarin, the next but one in rank to Gen. Ward, and is now his successor, thus keeping an American at the head of the Chinese army. A letter just received by his relatives in this city from Mandarin Forester, and dated at Ningpo, September 18th, gives a romantic account of the perils and dangers he had passed. Having, with the allies, attacked the city of Ching-poo, which was captured, with but little loss to the attack ers, Forester was placed in charge of the captured city, with a garrison of one thousand Chinese, while the English and French held the city of Ca-ding with about the same number of troops. Both of the places were held for some time, until the enemy that is the rebel army approach ed to the number of 180,000 men. Ca-ding was evacuated by the English and French, and occupied by the rebels, eighi-y thnna ond of whom then adranced and surround ed Ching-poo. v In the meantime, Forester had received a small reinforcement and al though the besiegers offered liberal terms of capitulation, he held out for twenty-one days, until ordered by Admiral Hope to evacuate, and proceed to Jungkong. He was to leave the city with an escort of six hundred men and three gunboats. - Three hours only were allowed for the evacua tion, while the orders wero to burn the city while leaving it . The evacuation was not successful, and the beleaugered city was too closely sur rounded to allow its brave defenders to escape. With others, Forester was made prisoner by the enemy. . " I will not," he writes in the letter be fore us, " undertake to recount to you my Suffering during the thirty-one days fol lowing, but will leave you to imagine them when I tell you that I am the only one the rebels were ever known to spare. I was five days without food or drink, and in the hot sun, and stark naked all the time. My captors marched me about six hundred miles through many large cities, where always in a state of utter nudity 1 was shown to the people. All this time, too a chain was fastened around my neck, and my hands were tied behind my back. If you want to find full particulars of all this re id the Chinese papers. At last by my good luck and the kindness of Admiral Hope, who sent a man-of-war after me, with a ransom of muskets and powder valued at ten thousand dollars, I was re leased. This is a kindness on the part of the English Government which I can never forget. - During the nnlucky evacuation Mr. For ester lost his valise with $20,000, and all hi' other property. He says that the city of Ching-poo was subsequently retaken by the Imperialists, with a great loss to the enemy, who had a force of but one thousand men and seven pieces of artillery. In this engagement, which was comnanded by Forester, he re ceived a severe wound in the shoulder. " It is the fourth wound in as many months," he writes, " and I am not dead yet." . The letter from which we are permitted to quote was writen before the death of General Ward, of whom his friend Forester writes: "General Ward's brother is, in New York trying procure a small navy' He will be glad to see you for his brother's sake, who (Ward) is a good and brave man, and has only thirteen Wounds, received during the last two years. Three Balls are in his body now." Guns vs. Iron Plates i Mr. Whitworlh, whose shells worked such havoc in the iron-plated targets at Shoeburyness, has addressed a note to the London Times, in which he sums up the results of his last astonishing experiments. He says : " In these first trials of the shells with large guns, I was desirous of using means already in nse as far as I could. The cav ity of the 7-inch shell was therefore filled with five pounds of ordinary cannon pow der. It is now evident that greater quan tities of powder, either alone or combined with other chemical agents more powerful BtilL, may be employed as bursting charg es, and much greater 'shattering effects' will be produced. "The simple construction of shell and the means of enclosing the bursting charge employed by me will, I believe, admit of such agents being used with much advan tage and without danger of premature ex plosion. There is another point to be con sidered; flat fronted shells are not deflect ed upwards by water, like the round heads. They will pass through very many feet of water and then penetrate a ship's side, or damage her rudder or screw, as was shown by experiments made at Portsmouth. A shattered hole made in a ship's side below the water line will be plugged, if at all, with very great difficulty." " The main point here set forth is the su periority of the flat headed shells over the kinds formerly employed. They can be made to pass through the water and Btrike a vessel below the water line without sen sibly diminishing their force, while their actual shattering enect upon the side or a ship, plated even so strongly as the last tar get used at Shoeburyness, ii sufficiently proved by the results of the trial in No vember. " In the same note, Mr. Whitworth chal lenges 8ir William Armstrong to a new trial of strength ; but that distinguished artillerist seems as much disinclined tore enter the lists as the iron men to encounter a new assault from Mr. Whitworth's fear ful shells. The controversy which has made guns and iron broadsides play for a year at the game of shuttlecocks appears to be decided for the present in favor of the guns." The hotels in Warrington, Va., are of little account just now. Beef and bread (Southern fare) is all that you can obtain, at any meal, accompanied by rye for cof fee. Two dollars a day at the poorest of them. A single meal of this character, costs one dollar. A Mrs. Tylor, of Connecticut, was sud denly missing, and having left a letter for her husband commending him to the wid ower's God, and advising him soon to mar ry again, it was supposed she had commit ted suicide. It now turns out she eloped with a fellow named Perkins. A Columbus dispatch says that orders from the War Department have been re ceived, that will require Draft Commis sioners to make out new statements of their accounts.
