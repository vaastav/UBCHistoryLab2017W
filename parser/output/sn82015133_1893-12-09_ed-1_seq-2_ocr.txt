The Shlboleth of the democracy Lets open a game! To be on the democratic ticket is to be in bad political company. The more the governor tries to sup press the vicious element the more they kick. The McKinley magnatisni is spread- in, oil nrar thA country. It will be felt in Tucson on election day. The Donulists and tha mugwumps will never whoop it up again. They turned on the gas and lay down to pleasant dreams. Blount vouches for the purity of the It would be a little interesting to know how Blount quired his stock of knowledge. Watterson once said ia a burst of nrnnhecv. that Cleveland would lead t 1 V the democratic party "through slaughter house to an open grave" and Watterson was right. On Sunday last our glorious climate was a gale. It was a wind 6chemeoi the Cockleburr democracy to puff their ticket at the expense of the Montezu- mas. Me. Fked G. Hughes has been placed on the democratic ticket to succeed Mayor Maish. Well, the people would just as soon vote against FredWIughes as they they would against Fred Maish Its all the same "Fred" to them. . We publish a synopsis of the pres idents message today. We have not read it consequently are not as yet hilarious over the good things it is supposed to contain. We hope how ever, that it will please our readers. Reavis the ni06t notorious land grant bilk this country ever saw is making promises of the fine things that he will do when southern and central Arizona has been confirmed to him. Of course he would do a few little things if he could steal as many big ones. He is the biggest fraud that ever tried to perpetrate a fraud and we warn people against putting faith in his promises.' Tnic mofit lsant and appropriate souvenir of the exposition which a .visitor can carry away is Bancroft's Book of the Fair, taking it home being the next thing to having the entire ex nofiition forever with him. It is the most complete and perfect reproduction of the great diEply that has been made, or that can be made within reasonable limits. The 1000 imperial folio pages which the work is to contain will be packed with all that is most interesting to read and best worth preserving, while the illustrations are in the highest art, as the numbers so far issued amply 6how. The republican ticket is one of the very best that ever was put forward by the people and for the people. It is a ticket that will commend itself and command respect in any community and ehould be elected to a man. This municipal ticket affords aditional proof that the republican party is the party of progress and good government. All that we ask in its behalf from our citi zens is that they will take the two municipal ticket3 that are now before them for their suffrage, and go over them man for man as to their business, business ability and general qualifications as to their fitness for the plaoes sought, and we are willing to abide their re sult. Nouodt would be surprised to hear that Secretary Gresham has resigned. His position is just now anything but a desirable one. Instead of the vindica tion he thought the publication of Blount's report would bring him and the administration he finds the public much more disposed to accept the answer to that report' made by the Hawaiian Minister Mr. Thurston as a correct story of the Hawaiian revolu tion. Secretary Gresham is 6&id to be gives those who come in bo chagrined mat ce naruiy contract with him a civil answer to the most trivial question. It is understood that he wanted to send Mr. Thurston his passports because he,made public his answer to Blount's report, but Mr. Cleveland forbid it. The greatest amount of wool ever im ported in any single year was under the McKinley law for the year ending June 30, 1893; so Justice, Bateman fc Co. point out. The imports of raw wool then were over ICS.000,000 pouDds, or 32 per cent. more than the importations of any pre vious year. This refutes and disposes of the charge so often made by free-traders ihftt. it is necessary to put wool on the free list in order to give American manu facturers cheap foreign wool for mixing. They never imported so much foreign wool as under the last year of the Mc Kinley law, the schedules of which were so wisely drawn that under it the wool en mills of the United States were em ployed to their full capacity, so that the entire American clip of 1802 was cot only all consumed in our home market but 108,000,000 pounds of foreign wool besides. The democrats of the ways and means committee are still undecided about a single feature of the internal revenue bill which they will have to prepare to meet the big deficiency created by their tariff bill. They wish to include the income tax, but so many vigorous protests have been filed against it by leading democrats that it is not certain what they will do. Harpy's Bazar for December 2d will devote a large share of its attention to Christmas presents. There will be three articles on this subject. ODe paper will discuss china and silver, a second handi work, and the third eifts for invalids. A feature will be a page of pictures of needley-work done by members of the Young Women's Christian Association of New York. The Citizen was never yet accused of boasting the democracy, but we candidly believe that we are applying saving grace to the Cockleburr ticket with as much unction as tbe btar, trie leaning democratic paper in Arizona, and will get as about ks much pay for the good work as it wil. The Cockle burr sings: The Citizen and the morning Star Do all tbey can to vex us; If t he dont stop, we tell them now We'll go bent for Texas. A HAMtsnjiE marble shaft is to be erected over the grave of the late Jerruiab. M. Rusk by the old friend9, neiabors aud admirers of the dead statesman. Jerry Rusk as he was popularly known, was a typical representative and a true son or the great north central stains, When he died the loss was national and irrespective of party emulations his death ia deeply mourned. As an active son ot Wisconsin lie is deserving oi affectionate remembrance at her hands and the monument about to be erected is conmemorative of that love and affection in which hie name was held The country has been foolish enough to believe that it is experiencing hard times. The mills and mines are closed down, three million of men are out of employment and their families need bread. Busines is paralized, capital shirks investment, money is scarce and hard to get. But all must be a mistake. President Cleveland 6ays the country is prosperous and congratulates the people upon this charming condition of things. What mockerv it is to congratulate a a man in jail upon the blessed freedom heeciovs. and a hungry man upon his ful! stomach. Uf coarse mo president is prosperous and if the country is not it ought t ) be. It has a president who can look famine away and see p'enty in poverty and destitution. A country must indeed be prosperous when it has such a president. The Southern Pacific railroad com pany is deserving 01 a vote ot tnanus from the loard of supervisors for the promptitude with which they pa'd their taxes upon the request cf Treasurer Overtop. There is no company or corpora'ion in the county that doe3 so much good, pays bj much t sixes or is more unthinkingly abused than the Southern Pacific railroad. In this times of depression, when money is needed to pay salaries and outstanding demands, the southern iacihc is prompt to meet its obligations and releive the treasury of the drain that running expenses make upon it Considering tbe amount ot money niiid in taxes to the county and in salaries to its employees, and tbe small cost it is to the county, it becomes out- Ju of its lult-a h.h 14. r.ommrn oarrior a public benefactor. Iris certain that Mr. G. D. Johnson, of Louisiana, who was the only demo cratic member of the civil service com mission, did not enjoy his Thanksgiving dinner. Cause why? He was per emptorily removed from office by Mr. Cleveland last week. Mr Johnson has ever since t he democratic administration came into office acted R3 though he thought it was his duty to stand by the most outrageous violations of the civil service law, in favor of democrats, rather than to enforce that law. He has-been going from bad to worse in that direc tion, and when the time came to prepare the annual report of the commission, which is now in the hands of Mr. Cleve land, there was an open rupture between him and his republican colleagues, and he refused to 6ign their report and wrote one of his own. That brought matters to a crisis and Commissioner Roosevelt told Mr. Cleveland that he would not remain on the commission if Johnson did, and Johnson didn't Prof. Proctor, of Ky., has been appointed to the vacancy. A proposition is to come before the supervisors and nas we are. informed already been before the city council for the purpose of paying the San Francisco Examiner a 6tated sum of money for a "write up" in a Midwinter fair edition of that paper. The amount we under stand, is to be anywhere between ?500 and $1000. For ore, and we know that many others taxpapers are of a like way of thinking, we hope that no such ap propriation will be made. To begin with neither the city or couaty have any money to appropriate in such a direction. If they have then let it be given to one or more of the home papers who pay taxes and help support the burden of city and county government. Givo tha hon paper- who make tbe hght for the city and country year in and year out, a little encouragement and finan cial help and they w ill get out a spe3itd edition that will bo a credit to the paper, its pnni' ters and iLeir backers. It will deal with Pima county alune. It will be distinctly a Pima county paper and not a column or two hidden among a hundred other "write ups" as must necessarily be the case in a paper where the entire Pacific coast is to bo extolled at so much per column rate. The Ex- aminer is a good paper. We have noth- ir.etoMyIlsi.tit,1,ut0ao8ie,rel, protest against the payment of public money to any newspaper outside of the territory. We would like to ask any of our cily or county officials who have this appropriation business under con sideration, bow much good can come to Tucson or Pima county from a write up that will be hidden under the glories cf California as portrayed in a Califor nia newspaper. Simply none. The republican candidates are re putable men of business and command the respect of the business element of the community.

THAT TARIFF BILL,. The tariff bill about which President Cleveland dwells so lovingly in his I message has been before the public for I a week or more, and a most careful etuay fails to hoti on single redeeming feature therein. It will, if it becomes a law, turn over the cream of the Amori- can market, the finest in the world, to I European manufacturers and Canadian farmers, and all it offers Americans in I exchange therefor are gl'ttering promises of an increase in the foreign trade of tbe United States, promises whieh are nnt hai;or i r-r. k fhnon whn havA , t, . , ... . ., . , made them. It is admitted that free wool would put an end to the produc- rn rf u-nnl In ia nnnntrv Q n 1 t Vl u f 1 , . , ... , free iron ore and coal will cause foreign coal and iron ore to be used exclusively in the neighborhood cf every Atlantic seaport and that American iron ore and coal will be used nowhere exept at places so far in the interior that the freight rates will allow them to compete with foreign products. These are only t-pecimens of the manner in which American industries have beeu treated by this bill. The same holds good throughout the bill. There ia hardiy a sin.re industry of any consequence in the United States that is not struck at in some way. And as if that were not evil enough to be con tained in a single bill this one changes the method of imposin r, the duty upon many cf the artkes which it leaves upon the dutiable list from specific to ad valorum, a system wh.di has been con demned by nearly every secretary of tne treasury the country has had as one that encourages f:au J and puts a premium upon deception. The bill is dishonest in every way. While purport ing to be a tanil for revenue its makers estimate that it would produce S5,00CV 000 a year less than the McKinley law. ItUvwlhsn:rar hnuntv whifh thai democrats claimed to oppose on constitu tional grounds, and provides for its continuance eicht years, dropping a quarter of a cent each year. The ques tion naturally arises, how can a bounty ot ot 1 .5-4 c nts bo constitutional if a bounty of 2 cents was unconstitutional? There is, however, one onsoling thing about this bill, it is so utterly bad and vicious that it cannot possibly become a law in its present fchspe, nlthongh-Mr. Cleveland's power may be sufficiently strong to force it through the house without amendment, but of that there are doubts. The constituents of demo cratic members who will feel the reduc tions in wages and loss of employment will make themselves heard and felt as as soon as they are brought to a realiz ing sanse of the injury to themselves that is contained in the bill. Many belive that the bill has been made I public in its present shape to feel the! public pulse and that the features which prove most obnoxious will later on be eliminated or modi tied bv a democratic caucus. The report of the republican minority of the house ways and means committee, upon which work is now being pushed, promises to be a document that will make republican converts by the thousand. It will probably be ready by the last of this or the first of the week after. King Lobengcla. savs the San Antonio (Texas) Expre-s, is dealiBg with John Bull: Oueen Lilikizooki with I ITnclA Sum.

Different cations have different ways of dealing w ith barbarians, and it is by no means certain that our way is the best. The British are unquestionably shocking the civilized world by their brutal butchery of the Matabeles; but what will decent people think of the most powerful republic of the world when it squelches a government established by the people of Hawaii and forces upon them as sovereign a yellow courtesan?

WASHINGTON, Dec, 4. "It is sui I must decline generis hcu novel sou to express my opinion about the prop osition, as I may be called t act officially in the matter." were the words which a leading treasury oScil used today when a reporter of the Associate! Piess showed the Denver dispatch saying Governor Waite has arranged for the coiuage of a hfbrid silver coin upon which is to appear the Mexican marks as well as the Colorado coat of arms. All the officials of the department with whom the reporter iHikfft tlt?clHreti tho &tutemo&ttf con tained in the dispatch were news to them, as they had not heretc'ore heard anything of it. The opinion was expressed that th9 plan was not feasible as it was believed the Mexican president would not erter into such an arrangement with a s'te government, as that said to be in con templation, but negotiate, if at all with the national government. Assim mg such com as thse described were issued, it is pointed out that taey would nave a tluctuating value: no body would take them except for tieir bullion value, and that they would not have any circulation outride of the state of Colorado. They would not be legal tenaers, me united estates gov ern men t would not receive pnd the banks ouid throw them out ao thev do Mexican dollars.

The police expect to make a large number of arresta in connection with the affair, as they believe they have discovered a genuine plot. Washington, Dec. 5. The general drift of opinion upon democratic mem bers of the house seems to be that the tariff bill must be passed and as speedily as possible. There are some who say they will make the attempt to have it modified ia certain points in interest of their constituents, but failing in that, will vote for the bill. It is understood to be the intention not to allow much time for debate even if cloture has to be applied, w:th the object of getting the measure before the senate as quickly as possible. IN THE 

HOTSE. The house met with but light attend ance below and aloft. Twenty-thousand copies of the president's message were ordered printed. After the morning hour the senate took up the Hawaiian question and Dolph spoke against the president's proposed action. At 1:40 on motion of Oates, the house went into committee on the whole on the bankruptcy bilL IN THE 

SENATE. Tha senate opened with a light attend ance in the galleries and on the flocr Dolph presented a petition from the Oregon Horticultural society favoring the maintentance of the present duty on prunes. Senate passed with slight amendments the house j oing resolutions appropriat ing coO.OOO f jr the employment of ad ditional deputy collectors of internal revenue to aid in the execution of the Chinese exclusion act. A 1 2 p. m. senate adjourned. v ashington, Dec. 4. Views of the members of both houses concerning the president s message are very freely ex pressed, iix-bpesiker Keed said: 4It is exceedingly disappointing, both in matter and manner. On the Hawaiian qnestion we are left as much in tbe dark as ever and must wait for the new on the next steamer, just as we have been waiting so long. "a nat part ci tne message which re lates to the tar ff asserts that the house committee in charge of the subject has formulated plans and devised methods of taxation, which, as a member of that committee, I have not even heard pro posed. It is rather an unusual sensation to learn of a committee, not in the com mittee room but from the president cf the United btates. lias that committee ceased in form to be composed of both parties, and has it, without even the for mality of a word in open coram ttee. in formed the president of its determma lion in such a way that the pre&idn can officially communicate it to tbe house? "How long has it been a part that committee and above all, a committee which controls the purse shall report to congress through the president? Is this result, rumored, a blending of the appointive w ith legislative power? "It is bad enough to have tbe tariff bill inaJs up by a little coterie; but to have it communicated to the president before it reaches even tha committee, still loss the house, shows a determina tion to bo moved by no arguments, which makes it an apparent absurdity the appointing of republicans on the committee cf ways and means at nil." Manderson, of Nebraska With dogged obstinacy and a mulish stub bornness that persists in wrong doing when a full enlightenment shows a wiser course, the administrntion, having hauled down the nag in Hawaii, cow proposes to trample it in the dust and we are to trade our Goddess of Liberty for a harlot. Cannon, of Illinois The message will not tend to restore confi 'ence to the producing and commercial interests of the country. Springer I approve of Hawaii as the onlv course consistent with the inter national honor and comity. Holman It is an able and forcible document. McCreary Able and appropriate. Dolliver of Iowa It is wanting in definiteness and makes no pretense to tbe leadership of public opinion. Wilson of West Virginia The i sage is all right. Tracy of New York I am heartily in accord with it. Gee r of Iowa The president gives away the ways and means committee on the income tax and ngrr-eo with Han cock that the tariff is a local issue.

TSVP ? PI! The Document Goes to Congress. TAEIFF REFORM. Legislation Bring Urged Ruin, That Sure. Must THE HAWAIIAN MUDDLE Cleveland Defends His Conine In Regard to tha Queen to her Throne Thinks Repeal has Brought Prosperity Washington, Dec. 4. President Cle veland, in his message to congress, com mences by reviewing the relations of United States with other countries and Bays: "WhLe our foreign relations have not been entirely free from perplexing an embarrassin situations, nothing re mams that will cot yield to thr.t spirit of fairness and love of justice which join ed with consistent firmness characterize the true American foreign policy." Speaking of the Lrazuian revolution the president says the United States does not recognize rebels and therefore the action of Commodore Stanton in saluting the rebel admiral was disavow ed in a manner not to be misunder stood. The action of the late minister to Chile in harboring two revolutionists was denounced and the president says "Under no circumstances can a repre sentative of this governmeLt be permit ted to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in countries to which they are accredited." 

CHINESE. Legislation on the Geary act reviewed and the president says he beiieves that under the amendment to the act Chinese laborers will avail them selves of renewed privileges of establish ing their right to remain and thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may, to a great degree, be avoided. Or the Nicaragua canal, he 6ays: "That the canal should be accomplish ed under aistintictively American auspices is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not admit of ques tion. Speaking of the unsatisfactory condi tion of affairs in Samoa, under the partite agreement, he says: "This incident and events leading up to it signally illustrate the impolicy of entangling alliances with foreign powers. AS TO 

HAWAII. Of Hawaii the president says: ' Questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused senous em barrassreent. Juet prior to the icstal lation of the present administration the existing government of Hawaii had been overthrown and a treaty cf annexa tion negotiated between tha provisional government of tbe islands and United States and submitted to tbe senate for ratification. Tbiu treaty I withdrew for examination and dispatched James 1L Blount to Honolulu as a special commissioner to matte impartial inves tigation of the circumstances attending the change of government. After thorough examination Mr. Blount sub mitted to me his report showing beyond all question that tne constitutional go ernment of Hawaii had been sub verted with the active aid ef our repre sentative to that governmeRt and through intimidation caused by th presence of an armed naval force of United States, which was landed for that purpose. "Upon the facts developed, it seemed to m the only honorable course for our government t j pursue was to undo the wrong done by those represent cg us. With the view of accomplishing this result within constitutional limits "of executive power the present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate in structions to this end. "Thus far no information of the accomplishment cf definite results has b?en received from Hawaii. Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will promptly be sent to congress, accompanied by a special exe cutive message." 

FINANCE AND SILVER. . After quoting statistics from the report of the secretary of the treasury tbe president says: lhe recent repeal of the law requir- iog the purchase of silver bullion by the government has made an entire chancre in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt th the ultimate result of this action will be the most salutary and far reaching After the recent financial perturbation time is rf quired ff-r there-estab.isbment of business confidauce. W hen, how ever, through this restored confidence, money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade, the survey of th situation will probable disclose a safe path leading to a p-r- manently sound currency sufficient to meet every requirement of our increas ing population and busiotss. In pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In this circumst&nco I am convinced thnt reasonable delay in dealiog w ith this subject instead of being injurious will increase the probability cf wisdom of the action." Tbe president recommends further postponement of the Brussels monetary conference and suggests that general authority be given the president to invite other nations to such confer ence at any time when there is a fair prospect of accomplishing international agreement on the subject of coinage. He also recommends that the exist ing statutes governing tne issuance 01 government bonds bn amended as the authority of the secretary of the trea sury is cot sufficiently clear. 

IMMIGRATION. The superintendent of immigration reports that during the last fiscal year 310,793 immigrants arrived at our ports. Of these 1003 were not per mitted to land. The presidents recom mends a more general and harmonious national quarantine system; at the same time the having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies. . THE 

ARMY. Owing to the efficiency of the na tional guard organization and lessen ing Indian hostilities the president suggests the reorganization of the army on the line of the present neces sities of the country. This change contemplates no increase in number or added expense. The repeal of tbe law forbidding the re-elistment of soldiers after ten years' service is recommended. Also the appropriations by congress to omplete the work of coast defense. rOSTATi 

MATTERS. The president is of the opinion that the system of free delivery of mails should not be extended to smaller communities than are now designated. called to the value of reform in . the postal THE NAVT. "While I am distinctly in favor of pursuing the policy we have inaugu rated in building up a thorough and efficient navy, I cannot refrain from suggesting that congress should care fully take into account the number of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of tbe treas ury, in considerii g the propriety of appropriations at this time to begin new work. 

PENSION'S. The president quotes from tha re port of the secretary of the interior that in June) last there were on the pension rolls UbC.Oiz names, an in crease of 80,941 over the previous Tear. Speaking of the recent rulings of the pensions the president says: "I am unable to understand why frauds in pension rolls ehould not be exposed and corrected with thorough ness and vigor. Everery name fraud ulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin. Those who attempt in line of duty to rectify these wrongs ehould not be accused of enmity or indif ference to the claims of honest veterans. THE 

CHEROKEE STRIP SCENES. The scent-s attendant upon tbe open ing of the Cherckee strip receives the president's attention and he says: "These outrageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without change in the laws. A subject I especially com mend to the attention of congress is statements contained in the secretary's report concerning registry. The president calls attention of the importance to farmers cf the depart ment of agriculture, also to. unwieldy propositions to wh ch the collection and distribution of new seeds has grown. CTVIIi 

SERVICE REFORM. Of civil service reform the president asys in part : "The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and the in creasing approval by the people of it operation are most gratifying. I am, if possible, more thin ever convinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law, not only in its effect upon public service, but also, what is even more important, its effect in elevating the tone of political life in general which underlies this reform of sturdy common-sense principal, not only suited to this sphere, but whose application our people are more and more reorganizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful opera tion of their government if not to its perpetuity. economy. xne president lavors economy in public expenditures and earnestly urges congressional legislation it be so limited by strict economy. 

TARIFF REFORM. Coming to the tariff he says: "The hard struggle of tariff reform is directly before us. After full dis cussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform and they have confided work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory of representation in public places of the people and their desires; if political officers are really servants of the people, and if political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give relief so long waited for will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wis and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the prin ciple that only the necessity of revenue justib.es the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot clo-e our eyes t tbe fact that conditions have grown up among us," which in justice and fair ness can ior discriminating care in distribution of such duties and taxation as the energency of our gov ernment actually demands. "Manifestly if we are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be reduction in the present tariff charges upon necessities, lhe benefits of such r-duction would be palpable and sub stantial, seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. This cot less relates to our people's prosperity and well being in removal of restrictions upon the importation of raw material necessary to our manufacturers, which would and should be open toour nation al ingenuity and enterprise. This can ict be while federal legislation tnrough the imposition of high tariffs forbids to American manufacturers as chap rmterials as those vised by their competitors. 'It is quite obvious that the enhance ment of the price of our manufactured products, resulting from this policy, not only confines the market for these products within our own borders and to the direct disadvantage to our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor ara certainly, though indirectly, involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufac turers to supply a limited demand for their goods t-oon fills a narrow market, to whi.'h th -y are confined; then follows suspension f milts and factories, dis charge of e npioyees and distress in the homes of our workir.gmen. Even if the often approved assertion could be ma good, that a lower rate of wages wru J result from fre raw materials ir d low tariff duties, the intelligence of rir workiamen haves them quickly to discover thRt their steady employment, f p?rar;itted by free materials, is a most T.portant factor in their relation to tariff legislation. the tariff bill commended, "A measure has been prepared by the ppropriate congress committee embody ng tariff relorm on the lines herein ugg.-sted, which will be promptly ubmitted for legulative action, it is the result of much patriotic and nselfish work and I believe it deals ith the subject as consistently and norough'y as the existing conditions permit. 1 am sat'shed that the reduced tariff duties provided for in tbe proposed egislation, added to existing internal revenue taxation within the near future.though perhaps not immediately. will produce suthcent revenue to meet the needs of the government.
