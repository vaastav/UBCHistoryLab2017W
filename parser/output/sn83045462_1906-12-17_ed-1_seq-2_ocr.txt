peaks of a d??termlned mind. His broad (shoulders and slow manner of speech ar? extraordinarily Impressive. His story of the cau?? of the shooting is the most complete yet given. "I came here a few days ago," he began. ^ "I had heard my sister Viola had been away from home, and I wanted to ascertain the cau?e. When I looked into the matter I had reason to suspect that she had been to Washington to have a crlml**q1 nnurati.-tn mirfnrmt*/! Wh<*fl TTlY SiStCT returned home I spoke to her about my suspicions. She denied it. "Having reason to suspect Bvwaters was responsible, I went to him. He. too, denied It, That was Thursday, and when I spoke to him he raised his right hand and swore he was Innocent. Finally I sa-w him and my sister together, and both denied the oharge. I told Bywaters If I found that he w;is guilty I would kill him. He declared he ought to be killed If he had committed such a wrong, and even said that If It were his sister he would look up the guilty man and kill him. ' I frankly told him I considered it one of the most horrible crimes I could imagine and I intended to learn the real facts. On the following day my sister was extremely 111, and Dr. H. T. Chelf was called In. She came near dying, and the examination made by the doctor proved my suspicions were correct as to the operation. Begged for His Life. "Immediately I got. Bywaters and ray Bister together, and they admitted everything. She begged for his life, for I told him I -would rather kill him than see him marry her. However, my sister pleaded for his life, and the doctor declared she was In such a condition he would not be responsiDie ror ner 11 sne were 10 rcteim such a shock. Despite that I told him tf I found out he only Intended to marry my slater to save his life or If he deserted her I would hunt him and kill him. Bywaters 6ald he wanted to marry her and only wanted her consent to prove his devotion. He said nothing could take him from her until she got well. Saturday he got the license and they were married, but I did not witness the ceremony. "During my conversation with Bywaters I told him how mean a thing It would be tf he did do such a thing, for he being a distant relative had been taken In our hom# almost as a brother." Dr. H. T. Chelf. who was called In when Ml? Strother became 111, declared he found Miss Strother In a desperate condition, and that it wns the result of a criminal opera tlon. The warrants were then issued. The Coroner's Inquest. Coroner Lewis began the Inquest yesterday after a postmortem examination of Bywater's body, lasting nearly all Saturday night. Ten bullet wounds were found on the body, five from a .32 caliber revolver and five from a .38. The first witness. L. B. Crump, a neighbor of the Strothers', told of hearing tlie pistol shots, going to the Strother house and finding the body. E. 8. Gaines, whose wife was a Miss Strother. gave important testimony. "Bywater married Viola," said Mr. Gaines, "but after the wedding he gave us to understand that he considered his duty done. My wife remonstrated with him and told him that because of the Illness of our child she would be unable to stay aJl night with Viola, and she told Bywater she thought he ought to stay, as his wife was so ill. "Bywater again said he would not stay, but went up to his wife's room. Later the boys went up. and Mrs. Gaines went up. When I started up the stairs I met Bywater coming down, as though fleeing. This was on the iwick stairs. I grabbed him by the coat collar and dragged him back to me n>om. tt hhi iranspucu in wie itjuiii between the time Bywater left us downstairs and the time I brought him back, I do not know. "When I brought him back he made for the window. Then the boys began to shoot. He got out the window and fell on the porch. None of us went to him." J. 3. Lenson, the first one to reach Bywater after he fell, testified: "Bywater recognized me," sa!d Lemon, "and asked me for water. I got It for him. and also got some whisky. He must have lived thirty minutes after the shooting. He mentioned no one but his mother, about whom he seeemd greatly concerned as long as he was conscious." Mr. Lemon was the last witness before the coroner. At i .e conclusion of his testimony it was announced that the Inquest would be resumed Wednesday Bywater's funeral will be held this afternoon, the services to be conducted by the Rev. Mr Winfrey of the Methodist Church. The services at the grave will be under the direction of the I O. O. F., of which Bywater was a prominent member. Told the Sheriff. The first news of the shooting was received In Culpeper inte Saturday afternoon by Sheriff Palmer, who was called up by telephone and told by James Strother that Bywater had been killed and that the dead man's body was on the roof of the porch at the Strother house. The sheriff immediately notified Judge D. A. Urlmsley, whose wife is a sister of Bywater's mother. The Judge was s->on in telephonic communication with Jatnes Strother and was told that Bywater wap dead. Strother further Informed Judge Grimsley that Bywater had been killed for trying to desert Strother's sister after he had married her Kvwatpr's hnHv wna found by the sheriff and coroner on the porch roof, where he had fallen. Thers were ten bullet wounds In the body. Just exactly what preceeded the snooting of By water Is not yet known. From what can be learned from those who have talked to the witnesses it appears after French Strother left the Strother place, James and Philip Strother came to Ctilpeper with By water. Philip and By water went to the court house and secured a marriage license, after which they returned to "Rotherwood." the Strothers place. In Philip's buggy. Meanwhile James Strother had gone after the minister, the Rev. J. W. Ware of the Episcopal Church, to perform the ceremony. The fovr men met at "Rotherwood" and the marriage took place at Mis* Strother's bedside. It Is said that soon after the ceremony Bywater declared he had done his duty and prepared to leave Rotherwood. Mr? Gaines, a sister to the bride, remonstrated and the trouble began. In the room are said to have been the bride, Mr. and Mrs. Oalnes, Bywater and James and Philip fltrother. Bywater, It is said, started to leave the room, and Hnding his way blocked sprang out of the -window. The firing began and Bywater was shot ten times before he fell to the tin roof of the poroh. where he lay until taken in chars* by the coroner.

CROWD SANG CANTICLES Venerable Prelate Much Affected as the Procession Proceeds. VATICAN TROOPS REPULSE HOB Clemenceatfs Reply to Gibbons?Effect of the New Law?Archbishop Farley Defends Clergy. PARIS. December 17.?Cardinal Richard, archbishop of Paris, today voluntarily vacated the episcopal palace and temporarily accepted the hospitality of Denys Cochin, the conservative deputy, at the latter"s residence In the Rue de Babylone. The departure of the primate was the occasion for an Imposing- manifestation on the part of the majority of the bishops and priests of fans, many members ol the noDinty ana about three thousand men, women and children. The gathering completely blocked the street In front of the episcopal palace and those present sang the Credo and other canticles as the cardinal was assisted into his carriage by the coadjutor archbishop. Mgr. Amlette, and his two vicars general. The crowd knelt and chanted as the cardinal seated himself In the vehicle. The venerable prelate, who was much affected, then arose and blessed the multitude. A number of young Catholics thereupon approached the carriage, detached the horses and with difficulty dragged It through Che dense masses of people lining the streets. On all sides were heard cries of "Long live Pius X" and "Long live the cardinal." About three-quarters of an hour was conRlim?>ri In milliner tho Mrrlnca frrvm t Via palace to the residence of M.

Detachments of mounted republican guards preceded and followed the procession In order to prevent any possible disorder, but ...ere was not the slightest attempt on the part of the crowds to make any counter manifestation.

ROME, December 17.?Thousands of demonstrators friendly to France and of antivatican tendencies gathered last night in the piazza adjoining the Farenese Palace, me seal 01 ?ie f rencn emoassy, 111 an endeavor to express their pleasure at France's action toward the church. The whole garrison of Rome was employed to face the demonstrants and protect the Vatican, which Is surrounded by cavalry, while the bridges leading to the Apostolic Palace are barred by troops. All the streets leading to the Palace Farenese are protected by soldiers with fixed bayonets. The demonstrators, led by a dozen radlr?n 1 srvpip liufQ an/1 rnnnWtno n tnamKooa a# the chamber of deputies, including Prince Borghese. after vainly attempting to break the cordon, provided themselves with candlea and formed into a mock procession, intoning the miserere as an indication of the death of clericalism, amid cries of "Ijong live France!" '"Long live Clemenceau!!" and "Down with the Vatican!" No Speeches Permitted. Deputies Costa and De Felice tried to harangue the people, but the police interfered. The demonstration occurred near the monument to Giordano Bruno, the monkphtlosopher who was buvned alive a victim of religious Intolerance. Deputy Costa Anally made himself heard. He said: "Before this monument to Bruno of free thought, let us send our appi-iuse to France, for this great people continuing the traditional obstinate struggle against the moth-eaten clericalism." Fresh attempts were then made to beat back the cordon, and the cavalry charged the demonstrators, a few of whom were slightly injured and several arrested. Amid iwttia auu j iiuuus nnu 111c 011151115 vi 111c "Marseillaise." the ferment continued until late in the evening. A commission of the demonstrators was received by M. Barrere, the French ambassador, who expressed his appreciation for the sympathy of the Roman people. The government endeavored by all means to prevent the demonstration. The stand that the government Is taking is that although Italy is friendly to France, she does not wish to take sides In the dispute, especially when her relations with the church are better now than they have been since 1870. Clemenceau's Reply. PARIS, December 17.?M. Olemenceau, the prime minister, has made public the following reply to Cardinal Gibbons: "The decisions which the ministerial council adopted this morning are in a ereat measure ldentcal with the verbal assurances which I have given already to the delegates of the Republican Union, but with one precise point In addition; that is. my determination to maintain the rights of lay societies with all the greater firmness in view of the persistent provocations ot Rome. The new law will sanction the gratuitous use of churches and objects attachincr to thorn for th?* nurnnsps r*f nnhlin wnr " ? ? r r ? ! ship, either to lay associations which are In conformity with the law on public meetings, or even to ministers of religion whose names are inclu-ded in such declarations." Continuing the dispatch says: " 'No one knows better than you, M. Clemenceau the conditions under -whtch tue Catholic Church flourishes In the United States.' " "I know,' replied the prime minister, In fhn TTnWa/J Ctot ?k^ll klMkV 111 ?.ilV VJ ti< IVU tfiakCD l"<3 VytVl-UUl 1UO, whether laymen or bishops or priests, give, and Indeed they ought to In a great republic, an example of respect for the national laws. In the elaboration of which they Justly take a part.' Briand Denies Cardinal's Charge. "I am authorized by M. Briand, minister of pu^.lc Instruction, to declare that there la no truth In the statement of Cardinal Gibbons that he. as minister, has on any occasion said that "Jesus Christ has been hunted out of the army, the navy and the schools, and now we must hunt Him out of the state.' ' M. Brland is remarkable among French statesmen for the clearness of his language and the calm precision of his views. He has never vi n known to indulge in rhodomontade. i.e has always been in favor ot a pacific solution of the present difficulties with Rome. The chtef objection which the advanced radicals have offered to his policy Is that It Is too mild. He Is accused of having displayed an excessive spirit of conciliation. "If one 1s to believe the persistent reports in well-informed political circles, there Is a certain lack of harmony between M. Brland and U. Clemenceau which, as already hinted, may lead to the retirement of the minister of pubHc Instruction, unless the situation quickly takes on a more neaitny lone. Says Attitude Was Unexpected. "M. Brland says the present attitude of Rome wan entirely unexpected. In view of the very terms of the papal encyclical, which advised French Catholics to take advantage of the provisions of the common law to assume a continuity of Catholic worship. The French clergy had already shown ttaelf disposed to accept the very libera! concession contained in the minister's last circular, when, like a bolt from the blue, came the order from the pope forbidding any such arrangement. Even Cardinal Lecot, archbishop of Bordeaux, was taken aback at this and had to withdraw the in- , structions hed had given to his priests. " 'It was owing to a sentiment of conciliation which I do not regret,' said M. Brland, 'and a desire to do nothing which (To be continued on Eleventh Page.) 

BUSINESSMEN OPPOSi Bill to Regulate Width ofVehicI Tires in District. UD QADOnPI^'O DDnDHCITini mii.unuuuvrx g i nui ugi i iui Representative Believed Action Necei sarv for Preservation of Streets. ? LOCAL SENTTHEHT IS AVERS] Commissioners Expected to Give Hearing Upon the Measure? Views of Citizens. The proposition to regulate the width < vehicle tires In the District, which has csl ed forth protests from merchants an prominent ousiness men in wuoinfion, u not emanate from the District building, is stated; and although there has been biM introduced In the House providing regulation which will require all wagot weighing with their loads over two tons 1 have tires at least four inches wide. It hi never been referred to the Commissioner therefore it has never been approvd or dli approved by them, desplt the fact that m mrous letters have been written to thes protesting against their "broad-tire bill." Col. Biddle, Engineer Commissioner, hf never given an official opinion upon th proposed legislation, but said today that I does not think it is necessary to Increai the width of tires to preserve asphalt or o mpnt but macadam surfaces are easily a footed by narrow tires, if the Urea are c heavily laden wagons. This bill to require four-Inch tires, it declared, can be traced to Chairman Bal cock of the District committee of the Houi of Representatives. When a party of coi gressmen, of which Mr. Babcock was member, and the Commissioners last Febri ary visited the dedication of the new Hlgl way bridge across the Potomac river. M Babcock, It Is said, decided that Washlnf ton's streets should be preserved by tt use of wide tires upon heavy wagons. H requested Commissioner Macfarland to hav the corporation counsel prepare as prompt! as possible a draft of a bill which woul cover this question. Commissioner Macfai land carried out the wish of the Dlstrii committee chairman, and a week later tt desired bill was In the hands of the latte but nothing of a definite nature has hai pened to It since, except protests. Commissioner Biddle's Action. Later, when Col. Blddle, District Bnginee Commissioner, learned that this leglslatio was being prepared, he directed Ca.pt. Mo: row, assistant commissioner, to make a ri port to him upon the efTect of heavy traffl upon the street surfaces. Capt. Morro stated that it is fully realised that the tra: flc, especially the hauling of brick, whic now uses the new bridge, is objectionable He said uiat any Daa conditions tnat ma be created upon the surface of the ai prroaches at the new bldge could be avoide by requiring brick wagons and other heai ily laden wagons to use wide tires. It 1b likely that before the Commissioner make any report to Congress upon this pr< posed legislation they will call for a publl hearing in order to learn the views of th general public. Business lien Opposed. Business Washington is practically unan! mous in opposition to the passage by Cor gress of a "rider" that Is attached to Rei reseivtatlve Babcock's bill "for the tern porary maintenance of the Long Brldg over the Potomac and for other purposes. The "rider" In question proposes to impos upon a large class of District business me what is generally described in commerces circles as "an onerous burden." by com pelllng them to provide for a certain claa of business vehicles specifying "wheel tire not Jess than four inches broad." Unde the provisions of the bill every wagon o other vehicle weighing when loaded mor than two tons must after Its passage b provided with the wide tires. Many business men were Interviewed t< day by Star reporters concerning the merit of the Babcock bill rider, and they a voiced strong opposition to its enactmer into law. Mr. John L. Newbold, president of th Merchants' Transfer and Storage Com pany, said he had Just received from th District Commissioners a communicatlo stating that the "rider" had never bee referred to them, nor had it ever been sail tloned or discussed by them. This denlt was regarded as significant in view of th statement of certain members on the floa of the House that the Commissioners ha approved the proposition. "The business men of the District," sai Mr. Newbold, "who are the parties direetl Interested, cannot find any one here advc eating the four-Jnch tire project. It wil If passed, serve no purpose but that of in; posing an onerous tax upon us. We can only find one city In the Unite. States that enforces a wide-tire law, an. that city Is Denver, Col. The experlmen was tried in England for several years but was Anally abandoned as a dismn failure. "The section of Representative Bab cock's bill. If passed, not only means th changing of the wheel tires, but man: wagons now in use will have to be en tlrely reconstructed. The two-ton weigh laden vehicle described In the "rider" wtl cover practically every two-horse wagoi in the District of Columbia and man; one-horse vehicles. It will apply to ap nrndmntfilv ii IMtf) vMilnloci and InvnlvA ai approximate expense to the owners o about $1,000,000. Tax Upon All Others. "Another thing," added Mr. Newbold, "1 will also Impose a tax upon all the citizen of the District, whether they own vehicle or not. The concrete companies declar that the proposed wide tlre3 In comblna tion with the narrow tires of other wagon and carts will increase the damage to th roadways and cause the companies t make greater repairs at an additional cos to the taxpayers. "Therefore," concluded Mr. Newbolc "all the citizens of the District, instead o a few business men. should be flghtlni this objectionable measure."

Since his return from the south at a about the time Representative Greene lntrois duced his bill to define the standing of the m teachers In the public schools. Dr. Chanis cellor, accompanied by Assistant Superln*. tendent Percy Hughes, has been seen sev'* eral times around the House end of the l* CapltoL ?

But Representative ? Foster of Vermont, who has displayed some Interest In local school affairs and who was a the author of the provision In the school l* bill that members of the board of educatlon be appointed by the justices of the Supreme Court of the District, was in the le House when Messrs. Chancellor and !e Hu^hea called one day last week and there re was a conference of these three gentlemen J that lasted for some time, r- Hearings After the Holidays. The Greene bill, concerning which there F) appears to be the deepest interest In Con> gress and out of It, will be taken up by the iivusq vumuL uinuuuLLcc 111 mtj lirai meeting after the holidays. ,r There will be no meeting of the committee n on Thursday of this week as Congress will adjourn on that date. In any event Mr. r" Greene does not desire to have his measure B* taken up until he consults with Representalo tlve Morrell concerning It. Mr. Morrell Is w expected In Washington tomorrow and he f- and Mr. Greene will probably get together h at once. b.

Chancheli lor and Hughes working at the Capitol y. either for or against any prospective or pending legislation. ? To Posh the Bill. As stated in The Star last week Repre* sentatlve Greene thinks the hn?j-ln<r? ?hli>h J] the District committee wlil^^pdo*btedly i- grant on hia bill will be of great benefit as is well as of paramount Interest and im8 portance to all connected In any way with r the local school system in bringing out the e whys and wherefores of the various acts e of the board of education and of the superintendent of scliools, which have been j i- iiueBuunea on one ground ana anotner. a There appears to be a remarkable unan11 lmtty of opinion among such members of it the House as were and are deeply Interested In the school situation a* to the ime portance of pushing the Greene bill ahead i- for all It is worth. Some of these members e think that the hearings on the bill will n clear up a much mixed situation and do as n much good aa any actual legislation. Others i- want to see the bill passed at the earliest il opportunity. e A11 are anxious to hear what explanation, r if any, the superintendent of schools and d the board of education have to offer for various acts which are considered to be In d direct violation of the spirit and Intent, if y not the letter, of the law. There is no )- doubt that consideration of the Greene bill I. will be attended by even greater Interest i- than that which marked the hearings on the general school proposition before the 1 Morrell subcommittee at the last session of i Congress. I Representative Morrell'a Position. 1 Of course Kepresentative Greene, who has had no conference with Mr. Morrell con~ cernlng the pending measure, is not able to y say what attitude the Pennsylvania mem ber will take. But In view of the fact that 1 Mr. Morrell was very closely identified with 1 the framing and passing of the school measy ure last session and that practically every body else who followed the legislation of iciai jcar is agreca uiai me intent 01 the t law has not been observed, there la every reason to believe that the chairman of the school subcommittee will approve the measure. ' Mr. Greene had originally Intended to s withhold his bill until he could confer with s Mr. Morrell concerning It, but the present 0 condition of affairs In the public schools, which Mr. Greene considers as bad enough now, with prospect of rapidly growing 3 worse. Induced him to put his measure In A ?KA KaoW ? * ,4~ V LUO uaoncii at Ilia ?ci J 11131 UyyUI lUIlll/< o Even he has been surprised at the general t Interest In the measure shown by members of the House who are not at all times fait miliar with or Interested in bills which aff feet any portion of the school system of the g District. But the Interest of members In the proper treatment of school teachers, s -which was manifested to such a remarkable e degree at the last session, appears not to t have lessened. Champ Clark of Missouri, ~ "the school teachers' friend," and practls cally all the other democrats and republlk cans on the floor who got together last t year to champion the cause of the lnstruc tors In the District school system, say they - are prepared to do a little more work this year to make It sure that the law which they passed last year as an act of right and Justice Is carried out In the spirit In which If la Inf e Sr. Chancellor Not Invited. Somehow or other the idea had gotten a abroad that Superintendent Chancellor, who r was out of town when the District subcom. mlttee of the House appropriation commitB tee sent him three requests on aa many dlf0 ferent days to come up to the Capitol In connection with the estimates for the school t system for 1906, had been asked to appear t before the subcommittee on Saturday.

Dr. Chancellor and Mr. Hughes were at the Capitol on Saturday, but they were evidently buay with other matters, as tl they did not appear at the headquarters of {( the appropriations committee. The subcommittee has not sent again tor Mr. Chancellor and has no intention of doing so. The hearings on the District bill having l been concluded, it is doubtful If the sub9 committee would hear Dr. Chancellor even 9 If he requested a hearing.

W. t STATL'S RIGHTINVADED QUARANTINE ORDER DECLARED TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. In deciding the cases of the Illinois Central Railroad Convpany vs. T. G'. I>1(vards and J. U. McKendree of Kentucky, the Supreme Court of the I'nltod States a/la xr hol/4 ta Ka 5 .uviu./ uv. <v> iv I/O UiavxiOlllUUUUCU Vila Agricultural Department's quarantine ordei i because the line fixed by it was made applicable to the state as well as the in- ^ terstate movement of fattle. The court's I jpinfon was announced by Justice Day and j reversed the finding of the circuit court - j ?f Carlisle county, Ky., from which the case was appealed. The case grew out of a claim for damages made by Edwards and M -Kendree igainst the railroad comptny, on account 3f the contraction of Texas fever by cattle owned by them through cmtact with cattle brought Into Carlisle county by the railroad conriDanv. The suit was in stituted under the act of Congress of 11*13 authorizing a national quarantine to present the spread of infectious disease* among: live stock. 4 The Carlisle court awarded damages, and the railroad company appealed the case, claiming the law to be uncons;inr? tional In that it delegated too much p iwer to the Secretary of Agriculture in allow- < Ing him to fix lines. The case was originally. during the last term, submitted to the court on printed briefs, and did not at first appear to be anything more than an effort to ecure small damages, but when the court discovered the attack upon the constitutionality of a national statute ft ordered a rehearing witfe an oral argu uiciii, ttnu caitcu mc aiiciinun U1 CUV AXtorney General to the mutter. The result was a decision distinctly holdng; to be invavid the act of the Secretary >ecause of its Interference with state cumnerce. The findings applied only to the >ne feature, but the court held that the ?rder could not be divided and. therefore, leclded the entire act to be unconstitutional. The effect was to compel a reversal of the verdict of the court below in he cases at bar notwithstanding they were Mtsed on interstate shipments. ^ GEN.
