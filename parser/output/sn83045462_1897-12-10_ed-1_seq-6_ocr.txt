The OppoMition Shift I nit (.round. Opposition to the annexation of the lla Vaiian Islands was first based on the jirop 0.-It ion that the rightful authority in the Inland" hail been overthrown l>y a con ?I'iracj in which the American minister a.. ( the commander of an American war v. Sel had participated, and that this Rov er.m**nt should not benefit by such a vronff. That was Mr. Cleveland's conten th <i. He withdrew the tlrst annexation treaty and sought to restore the deposed tjuee.1 to power. H!s failure was complete and covered him with confusion, and sine then no serious thought seems to have been taken by anybody of that policy. Attacks on the Dole government having erased, the opponents of annexation then shifted th. ir ground and pronounced against he.sting the flag over territory so far dis tant from the mainland. The islands were too far away. They could not with safety U- made a part of the American system of government. This was very promptly met t?> a comparison of distances between New Y?>rk and San Francisco. Boston and New Orleans. Washington city and Sitka. Alaska. Tile fact was developed that the United States already owns islands in her Alaskan possessions lying further to the west than Hawaii. An oft-ar cable and a line of swirt ?h:ps. which would very soon follow an nexation. would, it was shown, bring Hono lulu very close to these shores. The note of objection now heard is pitched in the key of criticism of the in habitants of the islands, it Is insisted that the Hawailans are not desirable for citi zens. that we don't want th.-m here, and fco forth. The answer to this is that there 1? 11 > proportion to bring them here They .1.. not desire to come. There is no reason why tfTey should come. They, of course. ? II not l.ave the islands. They are not a trrbulent people V, d< r the monarchy they bul.mitttd to great abuses. They have bentitte.l by the Hole government, and will contin.i. to benefit if the Islands become American territory. Hut that benefit will mterm to them where th ->? :,re. and i? cir ,hat "- ?I one no friction uicr?* or iiero. Th.s latest ,bj.-:ion of the opponents of annexation is a- poorly founded as was ?-ither Of the others. The real question to ai.-wered is. if this government rejects annexation, what is to become of the i~ian .' if we decline overtures for po JI unif>? with ourselves, will that end ??'.ir interest in th.- Islands?

Various suggestions ar.* made, thf ir ?t practical an ! popular beii?< that or the present commissioner of the bureau, who r* i .?maifi 'ls that a law be passed pro Iii;?it!nfc, the payment of a pension to a wl<iow who has married an ex-soldier sui> se*4Uent to the passage of the act, thus j?r? f.tinff the s: andalous spectacle of * mparativt ly younj? women marrying vet erans ??!' the war for the plain purpose of j?o-inic as 'soldiers' widows" after the tit o' i of their husbi nds. It is highly sig niheaiit that yesterday, while both houses of <*onsrress w? r considering this matter ??f pension payments, the chairman of the fe. iiat*- committee on that subject. Dr. GalUm r. wiined his colleagues agaiusi a thoughtless continuance of the custom of introducing what are known as "private pension bills." Senator Qailingor is in hearty sympathy with the veterans and the pension system, and his acts as chairman of this committee have testified to his right now tc speak in deprecation of the prac tice of adding promiscuously to the pension roll* hundreds of names that have been for good and sufficient reasons rejected by the governmental burt-au. This spectacle, of the chairman arresting the th"ught of the Senate on the subject of extravagance in pension legislation, is high ly edifying and Instructive, especially ?.s Dr. Gill linger joins the commissioner in rec ommending the legislation previously out lined. Opposition to the extravagances that have been heretofore committed In the name of patriotism and national gratitude is no longer to be set down blindly to the &< ore of a lack of sympathy with the senti ment that created the magnificent armies of the north in the early sixties. It does; not suffice to cry down with the charge of narrow thanklessness the voice of reason j that merely asserts that there is too much I laxity ir the granting of pensions and in ? the framing of pension laws. The evils that form the basis of the complaints now sounding in the ears of the people are not a necessary part of the scheme of reward- | ir.g the men who fought and suffered for their country. They arise from various | causes, and the demand is for their rerres- ! sion on lines that will in no wise injure ; the legitimate interests of the old soldiers ' or those who are lo'gically dependent upon | them. Senator Gallinger's plea tor more conservative treatment of private pension hills wHl ddut.tluss f nd echo in many quar ters were the "old soldier feeling" has in no wise diminished. How l.onn n Trial f The President in his message expresses the opinion that the Sagasta "reforms" for Cuba should have a fair trial. Their author claims that they are well -calculated to re store peacc to the island. If upon trial, therefore, they accomplish that object, there will be r.o occasion for American in tervention. If they fail, the notice is defin ite enough that the United States will in tervene. The cable shows that at Madrid this no tice iias received due attention. Senor Sa gasta soothes his fiery follower* with the diplomatic assurar.cc that the President spoke only to the galleries. He felt obliged to throw in something of the kind for Jingo consumption. The jingoes were demanding intervention at once. But in some high Spanish quarters the notice is differently interpreted. There it is construed as mean ing business, and Spain is urged to prepare at once for the inevitable. And accom panying this Is the boast that Spain will be be ready, and will defend herself in that urv. The question, then, of how long a trial the Sagasta "reforms" are to have before a decision on them is to be reached by this government becomes of the highest mo ment. TLe Star's correspondent from Ha vana shows that the outlook for success is gloomy in the extreme. So far. practi cally nothing has been accomplished. Gen eral Blanco seems sincere enough, but he Is working against the most tremendous odds. He is in the attitude of the physi cian whose patient refuses to take his med icine. The physician expresses the utmost j confidence in his nostrum, but the patient has no faith either in him or it. How long shall the wrangle at the bedside be per mitted to continue? What permanent ben efit is to be expected even if the physician succeeds in holding the patient's nose and forcing part of the draught down? Thi case today stands like this: We have assert* '1 our l ight and intention to inter vene in given circumstances. Spain repents it. and will not allow that in any circum stances such a right will exist. If we do intervene at any time she will resist us. She- is now preparing for such an emer gency. She is using our notice to her best advantage. The longer it runs the better prepared she will be. Pan-Americanism nntl Monrocimn. Germany's attention has in turn been ! called by one of her statesmen to th< fact that American goods are forcing their way into the markets of the world in such vol ume as to menace the commercial interests of the continent. This cry was raised a short time ago by Count Goluchowski ot | Austria, who foretold a commercial war against this country. Germany has long entertained the mcst bitter jealousy of England in the matter of manufactures | and her antagonism toward American food products is not yet abated, though a com fortable percentage of our surplus ma terials still finds its way into Ge rmany at good prices. Germany's present fear, how- | ever, is that the spirit of Pan-Americanism that was fostered by the late Secretary Blaine and still thrives through the In fluence of the reciprocity arrangements that were only lately revoked and are I about to be revived, will operate to close the markets of South and Central America to foreign products, while offering advan tageous terms to American goods and sup plies. In short, Germany is awakening to j the fact that this hemisphere realizes its self-sufficiency in the matter of trade. A speaker in the reichstag yesterday de clared that- Pan-Americanism is more mo mentous in its relations to Europe than Monroeism. The former is material and affects the pocket book. The latter is po litical and bears solely, in its lirst results, upon the territorial aspirations of Europe. Between the two, which will doubtless be sustained by the policies of this country as long as wisdom prevails here, Kurope fears that it will fare badly. The least I break, however, in the sentiment that | guards the markets and boundary lines of j the countries on this half of the globe will be hailed by all the nations of Ku rope with joy. The two principles are closely allied and must be equally main tained. ? ? Governor Black of New York is con sidering whetler it will be advisable to i pardon John Y. Mclvane. Possibly it has i been urged that to be an outsider when there is so much in the way of spoils go ing round is enough punishment for an ex-boss. The action of the Indiana minister who relinquished a pension to which he was not entitled was admirable and praiseworthy. IJut there is a pathetic significance in the comment which it excites as an exceptional case. The sultan was highly indignant over the attempt to assassinate him. He in sists that Ms study of the massacre ques tion shall be wholly objective. Mr. Grosvenor possibly thinks that civil service reform is such a good thing ihat | gnat care mist be exercised to prevent its becoming so common as not to be ap 1 rec.atcd. + ? Kx-President Cleveland and ex-Candi date Bryan are both hunting ducks. The situation is likely to develop some rivalry between the partisans who give out the figures on the re*>ult of each day's soort for publication A <? ol d font fur MInm Liberty. It is proposed to gild the statue that sur mounts the dome of the Capitol. This fig ure is commonly called the Goddess oC Lib erty, though some authorities insist that it represents Freidcm. The distinction is a tine one and immat? rial when the ques tion of gilding the statue is at the front. When It was proposed to gild the roof of i he new library building protests were i heard from certain quarters that this pro i Ject would not be in conformity with the | dignity of the structure or with the pur poses for which It was intended. But the gilding was dci.e and justifies it?elfl It gives a distinctive character to the build ii.g. It cannot be supposed, of course, that the desire to gild Liberty?or whatever her name may be?springs from a sense of competition in the breasts of the grave and revere nd senators now considering the prop osition. It must be that they have been pleased with the success of the gilded dome across the way and wish to go in for a little ornamentation themselves to make things In the neighborhood harmonious. A gilded statue on the iop of such a lofty structure as the Capitol dome would be distinguishable for many mile's. At present the statue is treated in a most indifferent manner, being painted occasionally and cjuickly acquiring a rusty hue that does not correspond with the gereral tone of i the dome. The work of painting the fig lire is perilous and suggests tragic possibil ities to those who from the security of the ground beneath view the cautious move ments of the riggers and painters high above them. The coat of gold leaf once given there would be no need for further attention to Liberty for many years. Spain's bull-fights are unquestionably de moralizing; but the no less repulsive mania for watching a number of exhausted, half crazed men suffering tortures in order to stay in a bicycle contest has not yet struck that country. . ? ? ? Captain Loverjng is exceedingly fortu nate that his superiors in the army have so little of iiis own severity in ideas of discipline. 

SHOOTING STARS. lie Fore bore. "Do you believe that it's always the vr.expected that happens?" inquired Miss Cayenne. "I wouldn't venture to express myself on that subject," replied Willie Wash ington. "Why not." "Bccause I am Uo polite to contradict the girls who. when you propose to them, invariably say, 'this Is so sudden!' " The Form H:iud*M Problem.

"I thought you told me that man is an animal," s;id the every-day citizen. "So he is, in the strict sense of the word." "I guess you would do well to revise your theory." "What makes you question it? It's an established fact." "Well, maybe it is. But I haven't heard of the S. P. C. A.'s interfering to prevent anj- six-day bicycle races." Analyzing- a Metaphor. "1 wonder," said Mis. Meekton, "why they say that silence is golden." "1 gutss," replied her husband, very unguardedly, "it must be cause gold is so hard to jet sometimes." Not Entirely Consistent. "What do we want to annex Hawaii for?" inquired the man who waxes eloquent on the spur of the moment. "Merely to keep somebody else from getting it: merely for the sense of possession; the empty satisfac tion of control." "Did you know that Wiggins was looking for you this morning?" "No. I'll hunt him right tip. Maybe he's rea.iy to sell thai lot next to mine, i don't really need the ground, but it will increase* in value and I want to avoid the risk of getting bad neighbors."

A C'ouspieuoiis Omission. From thr? New York Post. One of the mcst noteworthy things about the President's message is a thing which is not in it. The long document contains 110 allusion whatever to the subject of pen sions. This omission would attract remark in tii"' east' of any President. It becomes 1 he more striking when one recalls iliat .Mr. McKinley was himself a soldier in the I'nion army, and has always been a strong advocate of a generous policy regarding pensions. It is rendered still more impor tant bv the fact that in his message to Congress at the opening of the extra ses sion last March.the President urged that "ample revenues must be supplied, not enly for the ordinary expenses of the gov ernment, but for the prompt payment of liiveral pensions," etc. It is a great change from such an attitude in March to the en tire ignoring of the whole pension question n December, especially when the failure to recommend a liberal policy now is accom panied by a protest against an increase of the expenses of the government, and a suggestion that "these expenses will, in my judgment, admit < f a decrease in many branches of the government without injury to the pu'?lic service." ?? A Very Sick Man. S. E. P.ishop in the New York Independent. The further reply may be made that the liawaiians have unfortunately failed to maintain due existence as a people. By extreme decline of numbers they have practically lost their claim to nationality, and have become far exceeded numerically by the other races resident in the country. During the sixty-five years of the writer's distinct recollection they have wasted from l.'Hi.OoO to added to ?,f?00 part Hawaiians. Against these are 40,000 Asiat ics, lb,000 Portuguese and 7,500 other Eu ropeans. While the natives are steadily de creasing at nearly 2 per cent a year, the prolific Portuguese are making a natural annual advance of 12 per cent in this healthy climate. While the Hawaiian merits our kindest regard and sympathy, it must be conceded that he is a very "sick man." In kindness he cannot be left to assert a right to control the vast public interests centering here. Kalakaua loudly sounded the popular national cry, ' Hawaii for the Hawaiians!" But if the Hawaiian* are unable to prolong their own lives or b*.get children, how can they continue pro prietors of the country? , China as the Cradle. From the Iiosiun Herald. The latest novelty in the way of conten tion among the scholars investigating the antiquity of the human race is that the Garden of Eden was in China?that Adam was a Chinaman, and that Eve was almond eyed. This is a proposition seriously put forth in reputable professional quarters. The claim is that the civilization of Egypt did not come primarily from Assyria, but that China sent it there, taking Assyria as a stopping place on the way. This, of course, does not go back to the original al leged ape of Darwin; it only contends that, if there was an ape ancestor, he was a Chinese ape. The Chinese, it will be re membered, have always made this claim of superior antiquity for their people. The peculiarity in the case is that Christian scholars are accepting their views. Stimulated Stamp Sales. From the Philadelphia Inquirer. The postmaster of a little town in Ohio adopted an ingenious plan to increase the sale of postage stamps and so increase his salary. He gave away a drink with every ten stamps and gave a stamp with every drink. Everybody in town soon developed an intense desire for stamps. The post master had, however, forgotten the trifling preliminary of taking out a liquor license, and the government, which did not, of course, object to the sale of stamps being stimulated, arrested him for stimulating the people in an Illegal manner. A man with such an ingenious turn of mind is, however, not unlikely to remain long in ob scurity. He will be heard from again. Smoking Jacket^.
