Tho President congratulates Congress on tho successful execution of thc Resumption Act. The demand upon tho treasury tor gold and silver in Rxchungo for United States notes has been comparatively small, and thc voluntary deposit ot' coin and bul lion in exchange for notes lias been very i largo. Tho excess of thc precious metals j deposited or exchanged for United State.-; I notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about forty million do Ins. Ho refers to thc consequent rcviv d of trade, at ti stijs th t thc incom ing loreign demand for our manufactu ring and agricultural products baa caused a large balanco of trudo in our favor which has been paid in gold, (rom thc first of .July hist to November l?tti, to the amount of $09,000,000. Since tho rcKumpticu of specie payments there baa also been a marked and gratifying improvement ol' the public credit. Tho bonds of tho go\cr? ment bearing only per cent, interest have bein sold at or above par sufficient in amount lo pay elf tho National debt which wis redeemable under thc present laws. Thc amount of interest saved annually by the process ol refunding thc debt since March 1st, 1877, is 814,207,177. Thc bonds sold were largi ly in small sums, and thc number of our citizens now holding tho public securities is much greater than over before. The amount of the Nation; 1 debt which matures within less than two years is 0102,121,700, of which ?500:U?U,O?? bears in totes t at the Vole of livo per cent., thc balance is in bonds boning G per cent, interest, lt is believed that this part of thc public debt can bc refunded by the issue of ? per cent, bonds, and by tho re duction of interest whioh will thus be effected about $11,000,000 can bc annually saved to ibo treasury. To se? ure this im portant roduotiou of interest to bc paid by thc United States further legislation is required, whioh it is hoped will bo provided by Congress during its present session, THE 001.1.? AND 

SILVER QUESTION. Thc coinage cf gold by tho mints of thc United Stales during the last fiscal year was $-10,980,012. Tho coinage of silver dollars ?duce thc passage of tho act for that purposo up to November 1st, 187!), was 8l5,000,8f>0, of which 812,700,811 have been issued from thc treasury and arc now in circulation, and 8<J2,800,50l> arc still in thc possession of tho government. Tho pendency of thc proposition for unity of j action between the United States and thc I principal commercial nations of Lurope to j effeot a permanent system for tho equality i of gold and silver in thc recognized money Of tho World leads mc to recommend that J Congress refrain from new legislation on tho general subject. Tito great revival of j trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during thc coming year, its own instruc tions, which moy well bc awaited before attempting further experimental mcusurcH with thc coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Congress thc importance of authorizing thc Secretary of thc Treasury to suspend thc coinogo of silver dollars. Upon thc present legal rates thc market value of tho silver dollar being uniformly ! and largely lesa than thc market value of I tho gold dollar, ic is obviously iinpracticu ? bio to maintain them at par with each other I if both aro coined without limit. If tho j cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will bo reined without limit, soon becomo tho ?ole standard of value I and thus defeat thc desired object, which ia j a currency nf betti gold and silver, which ] shall bc of equivalent value, dollar for j dollar, with thc universally recognized i money of tho world. UHKKNltACKS SUOUi.l) UK WITHDltAWN. Thc remo from ch eolation of United ? States notes wuh thc capacity of legal tender in pr?valo contracts is a step to bc taken in our progress toward a safe and stable cur rency wilie! should be accepted us thc i policy und duty of tho government und thc i interest and security of thc people, lt is my firm conviotion that tho issue of legal I tender paper money, based wholly upou tho authority and credit of tho government, oxoept in au extremo omergency, ia without Warrant in the Constitution sud a violation of sound financial principles. Thc issuo of United States notes during tho late civil war with tho capacity of legal tender bei tween private individuals was not author izod except as n means of rescuing thc country from imminent peril. Tho circu lation of those notes as lt paper money for any pro ti acted period of timo altor thc accomplishment of this purposo wus not contemplated by the framers of thc law under which they were issued. They an ticipated thc redemption and withdrawal of these notes at thc earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. Tho policy of thc United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of thc Constitution, has been to avoid thc creation of a National debt, and when from necessity in thc ti:;;cs of war debts have boen created they have been paid off on the return of peaco ns rapidly as possible. With this view, und for this purposo it is recommended that the existing laws for tho accumulation of ii sinking fund sufficient to extinguish lh( public debt within ti limited period bc maintained. UKSTOlli: THU TAX ON TKA AND COFFKi: If any change of tho objecta or r iles o taxation is deemed necessary by Congress it is suggested that experience hos showi thal a du'y can lc placed, on tea and collei which will not enhance tho price of thosi articles lo Ibo commuer, and which will nd< several millions of dollars annually to tin treasury. ?ni:: suPl'tiKfiSiON O?' PO LYU A M r. On thc subject of polygamy tho Presi dent says Ulah hus a population audici?n to entitle it to admission as a Stute, and tin general inteiosts cf the nation, as well a tho welfare of the citizens cf thc Territory require its advance from the territorial loni ol' government to tho responsibilities am prjvilugcs of a State. This importan chungo v.ill not, however, bo approved b thc country, while thc citizens of Ut'ih, i very considerable numbers, uphold tt prac tiec which is condemned asa crime by th laws of all civilized communities throughou tho world. He mentions that as thc hr for the suppression of polygamy baa uo' been decided by tho Supremo Court to b within tho legislativo power of Congie and binding as a rule of action for all wb reside within thc Territories, lhere h n longer any reason fer delay or hesitation i its enforcement, lt should bo (irmly un effectively executed. If not sufficient! strong in its provisions it should bo aincudui and iii aid ol' thu purposo in view he rc commends that more comprehensive at, searching methods for preventing ns wc as punishing this crime bc provided, necessary to secure obedience to th.-, la thc enjoyment und exercise of thc rig li i and privileges of citizenship in tho Tcrritt rles of thc United States may bo withho or withdrawn fiom those, who violate oppose tho enforcement of the law on ll subject.

While many topics of politii I concern demand great attention from o I people, both in thc Rphcroof Nation;'.! a State authority, f lind no reason toquai thc opinion 1 expressed in my last anni message, that no temporary or a dui i it ts tr tivo interests of government, however i gent or weighty, will ever displace thc z of our people in dofouco of thc prim; rights of citizenship, and that tho power public opinion will overrido al! pol i ti ! prejudices and all sectional and St j attachments in demanding that all over t i wide territory thc name and character Cit izo n of thc United Slates shall rem ono and thc same thing and carry w tilcin unchallenged security and respect, earnestly appeal to tho intelligence u patriotism of all good citizens of cv part of thc country, however much ll may bc divided in opinions Oil other poli cal subjects, to unite in compelling obc euee to existing laws uimcd at thc proti lion of thc right of suffrage I respcoffi urge upon Congress to supply any tiefe in these laws which experience has shoi and which it is wi th i ti its power to reine I again invoke thc co-operation of executive and legislative authorities of Stales in thi;> purposo. 1 nm fully coovin that if thc public mind can bc set at 1 on this paramount question of popi rights no serious obstacle will thwarl delay the complete pacification of country or retard thc general diflusic.] prosperity. OlVlb SBttVlOK RKFo?M. On thc subject of civil service rofe which tho President treats tit sonic len? ho says: "Lu view of tho tact that dui ti considerable period thc Covcrnincnl Great Britain has been dcnlinp; with adn istrativo problems and abuses in vari particulars analogous to those presentee this country, and that in recent years measures adopted were understood to li been effective and in every rospoct hij; satisfactory, I thought it desirable to li i fuller information upon tho subject, accordingly requested tho chairman of tho civil servicecommission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. Tho result has been au elab?ralo und comprehensivo ?'r?port. Tho report sets forth tho history of tho partisuu spoils system in (J rcat Britain, of thc rise and fall of parliamentary patro nage and of ollicial iutorfcrcneo with tho freedom of elections, lt shows that uitcr : long ttiala of various kinds ol' examinations j those which arc, competitive nod open ou j equal terms to alt, ai d which aro ' carried on tinier thc superintendence of a j (jinglo commission, have, with great ad KSutftgQ/ been established us conditions of admission lo almost every official pince in i thc subordinate administration of that j country and of British India. Tho com ' plotion of the report, owing to thc extent of j the labor involved in its preparation und ! the omiston of Congress to make any pro J vision either for tho compensation or the , expenses of the. commission, has been post . poned until thc present lime. It is hcre j with transmitted to Congress. While tho i reformed tnonsurcs of another government ! arc of no authority fer us, they aro entitled j to influence to tho extent to which their I intrinsic wisdom and their adaption to our j institutions, and our social lifo commend thom to our consideratiou. The views t j have heretofore expressed concerning tho j dulcets and abuses in our civil administra tion remain unchanged, except in so fur 08 nu enlarged experience has opened my eyes to tho want of u?sensu of duty on tho part of olVioors, and tho hCsitutiou of tho people themselves to co-operate for their removal. A largo and responsible part of the duty ol' restoring tho civil servite to the desired purity und efficiency rests upon tho Presi dent, and it has been my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and gradual measures ol' reform as will most surely and rapidly hiing about tho radical changes ol' system OSSOn t in I to make our administrative meth ods satisfactory to a freu und intojligent peuple. J?y a proper cxerciso of authority it is in thc power ol' tho Executive to do much to promoto such a reform, but it cannot bo too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without cooperation on the part of Congress, nod considerate und intelligent Mlpport among thu pei.plc." ile rilera to tho work of thc Civil Service (Joinmission, and tho failure of Congress to appropriate money for thc resumption of the work of tho com mission. On tho subject ol competitive examination! for cilice he says: "1 think that tho economy purity and efficiency ol the public sorvioc would be greatly promoted by their system utio introduction, wherever practicable throughout the entire civil service of tin government, together with ample provisioi for their general supervision in order ti secure consistency und uniform justice Reports ol' examination.* heretofore m a di show that tho results havo been salutary it n marked degree, and that thc genera application Of similar rutes cannot fail to b ot* decided boucfit to the service.

Thc message refers to tho reports of t Soorctaric?; Sherman, MeCrary, Thom j son, Key and Schurz, and embraces extra j therefrom, lt says that the pant year 1 ' been one of almost unbroken porteo n quiet on tho Mexican frontier, oud there is reason to hope that tho efforts of this government and of Mexico to maintain order in that region will provo permanently successful.
