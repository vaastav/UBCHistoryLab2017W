Judge Humphreys thlB morning In structed the jury In the ease of the perjury charge against ox-judge Kath burn to bring In a verdict of not guilty, on technical grounds. The court held that the prosecution had not shown the materiality of the statements sworn to by the defendant and alleged to be false. Attorney Ilobertson moved to dls aharge the defendant on two grounds, the lirst being that the prosecution had failed to show that the Grand Jury be fore which the ulleged false testimony had been given was a regularly Im panelled grand jury, or that there was a quorum present, making the ses sion a regular one, at the time when llathhurn testified, The other ground was that the statements alleged to have been untrue were not material in the case that wus before the jury. The court held -with Deputy Attorney General Cathcart as to the regularllty of the grund Jury proceedings, but found that the statements of the de fendant under oath alleged to have been false were not material. When Kathburn testified before the grand Jury, Dr. Carter was under a charge of assault with a weapon ob viously and imminently dangerous to life. The disputed testimony was as to whether Kathburn was on the Carter promises when he wns shot by Carter. The grand Jury held that he was and it did not Indict Carter because it held that the shooting was Justifiable. Incidentally Judge Humphreys had to decide the question of whother It would have been murder if Dr. Cartel had killed Kathburn. The Judge held that It would. It was not material In the consideration of the case against Carter, the court held, whether Rath burn was on Carter's premises or not when the shots were fired. Therefore Kuthburn's sworn statement that he was not on the premises, even If false, could not be made the basis of a per jury charge. "There Is no evidence In this case that Dr. Carter was unfriendly with the defendant Kathburn, or had warn ed him to keep away, said Judge Humphreys, "and the mere fact that the defendant was or was not on the premises of the Dr. Carter when the shooting took place Is Immaterial. I do not believe that a man living In the country, whose place abuts on a public road, has a right to shoot without .warning when he sees a man trespass ing on his grounds. It was therefore not material in the hearing of the case against Dr. Carter, whether Kathburn was on his premises or not. It would have been assault, or murder If Kath burn had been killed, In either event The jurors were called Into court and Instructed to render a verdict for the defendant, and Knthburn was dis charged.

Despite the trying experience of hav ing been the center of charges calcu lated to dishonor his career If proven and the trial which cost the govern ment in the neighborhood of $200,000, Commander Tllley shows few signs of having passed through such an ordeal. He does not care to discuss the mat ter which has been fully exploited by the return of the Admirals and cap tains comprising the court and is re turning home by a leisurely route. "Commander Tllley is In excellent health, thank you," said Mrs. Tllley this morning. "We are going through on the Sonoma to San Francisco and will take the Southern route to Wash ington. I am sure that the Comman der has no idea of his ultimate destina tion, we are Just going home." Commander Tllley has as yet receiv ed no appointment or orders from headquarters and Is entirely ignorant of what will be his next duties. There will be u cordial welcome awaiting him n Washington from his comrades, who, aside from the honor of the service having been are proved unimpaired, are all glad at the outcome of the pro ceedings against their old friend and comrnde. Commander Tllley is very popular with his naval associates. An olllcer from the Wisconsin went aboard the Sonoma with despatches for Commander Tllley the first thing this morning and the nature of which was not divulged by the Commander, who will meet Admiral Casey, Captains Kelter and Merry and probably the rest of the stnff before the Sonoma leaves. Commander and Mrs. Tllley remained In their state rooms until the vessel was cleared of passengers this morn ing and came on deck but Infrequently during the voyage.

The annua report of Secretary of Agricul ture Wilson tells of the vast growth or all branches of the department's work. An extension of the weather forecast to farmers through the rural free, delivery Is contemplated. Wireless telegraphy will soon connect Tatoosh island, Wash., with the mainland. The report says that during the year a station has been established in no- wall. Among the first work at this station was the planting of taro, with the special object of studying the dis eases seriously affecting that crop, Probably 50 per cent of the working po pulation in these Islands depend on taro for their dally rood, and, owing to these diseases and the attendant deteriora- tlon or the crop, the price or taro nas Increased COO per cent In the last de cade. Some other diseases of fruits and vecetableB call for study, and poul try experiments have been inaugurated with a view to increasing the supply of poultry. It Is reported that live chickens sell In Honolulu at $15 a doz en and eggs at 40 to 50 cents a dozen. Hogs br Ing from 10 to 17 cents a pound on the hoof and experiments have been undertaken In the feeding of swine with various tubers and roots. The Secretary regards It as extreme ly desirable that agricultural investlga tlons should be undertaken In the Phil ippine Islands under the War Depart ment and In co-oneratlon with the Do, nartment of Agriculture, in further ance of this work the Secretary recom mends an additional appropriation or $15,000 for the ensuing fiscal year.

The latter he secured from a Portuguese woman who was chopping wood, threatening her with his knife In order to obtain the heavier weapon. .Mossman was the next to see him with a crowd of boys. Williams offered to give himself up If the boys were call ed off. Instead of doing so he made a Icloui cut with his knife at Mossman who was unarmed und warned him to keep his distance.

Last nlgnt at about uociock vii bags of mall from the Doric were landed at the post office, and the force Of employes started at work on the porting of about 70,000 letters. They worked all through the night, and when morning came there was no sign of a thnnce to reBt. The outgoing mail by the Coptic last night consisted of 1B3 bags, and the clerks had been rushed io the limit getting ready before the Doric came. 'This morning there was the Sonoma from Australia, and it was Island steamer day. Sixty more bags of mall went on the Sonoma, closing up the Christmas present business for the coast, It is thought.

SCOW LAUNCHED The new steam scow belonging to Hnckfeld and Company, the Issuunce f a license for which lias been the ause of much controversy In the past aVI possibly th future. Jtf tween that flrln and Collector Stackablc, slid off the greased ways Into the water nrst thlnir tlils morning. The launch was entirely satisfactory and the Iron hull now lies oft the Naval wharf No. 2 where she will be, fitted with the finish ing touches. The point at issue In the granting oi a llrpna?. to n vpsHel that has been manu factured In Germany nnd is fitted with n fm-Hlcn hoi er. Collector HtacKauie claims, quoting from authorities in de cisions already ruled, that the scow Is conclusively a Gorman vessel and not German Iron, which muy be worKeu into a vessel and duly licensed to ply In American waters providing the original duty has been paid. The rulings shown by Mr. Stackable state that foreign built vessels may not be documented and that the ordinary fitting together of parts does not con stitute building a vessel. Collector Stackable states that he nan received Instructions from Washington to allow the scow to carry on the busi ness of lightering until such time as Hackfeld and Company will have op portunity to secure a decision In the matter from the forthcoming congress. It Is said that the temporary permis sion granted was the result of corres pondence betweon Hackfeld and com pany and Washington through the me dium of Secretary of the Territory Cooper. Collector Stackable feels sure that the license will not be permanently granted in the face of the rulings that he holds as such a procedure would be tantamount to letting down the bars. Hackfeld and Company claim that the vessel Is not foreign built as Mr. stuck able understands It and Is duly qualified to hold u license. CAPTAIN PuSD TO REMAIN.

LATEST FAD. Evening parties at the "Tea House" She Covered 384 Mites on One Day. Lowered All Reeenls From Sydney to This Port. With every reoord hanging to her belt, the Sonoma arrived oft Mirt this morning at 5 o'clock after making the quickest trip from Sydney to this port that has ever been made. In fact, site established new records for the through trip ns won ror in Intermediate runs between ports.

The vessel left Sydney November 28. and made Auckland In 3 days 12 hours and 53 minutes. From Auckland to Pngo Pago, the vessel covered the dis tance In 4 days 2 hours and 48 minutes and from Pago Pago to Honolulu in 0 days 3 hours and 10 minutes. Her best dully run was 384 miles. She averaged about 15Vi knots. By making this quick passage, the vessel has lowered the best previous records, which had been made between those ports and which she es tablished on her first trip. She cut down her own record which wus the best ever made, by C hours and 17 min utes. She will probably not lower any records between here and San Francis co as she Is scheduled to arrive there next Monday morning. Chief Engineer Little Is delighted with the splendid showing made by the vessel. Strong winds and rough seas were experienced between Sydney nnd Auck land, but the balance of the trip was characterized by fine weather. Commander and Mrs. B. F.

MWHIM, hlW TOM. Lal Doolrs Have Claims for Nearly $9,000 Duty, Assessed Against Their Pretest Supreme Court Ruling. One man In Honolulu mu very happy last night when the news came of the decision of the United States Supreme Court In the muttm- of tariffs on good from the Philippines. He is 11. J. Johnson, custom house broker with Hinds Rolph and company, who Iuik made protests In behalf of Importers on payments of duty amounting to $18, 892.4C. All of this Bum that has been paid will now be refunded, ns the Su preme Court hold that the Philippines ore domestic territory, as far as tariff matters are concerned. It is said that there about 400.009 Manila cigars now here In bond wait ing for this decision. These will now- come on the market. Honolulu will have the cheap Manila cigar again, under the new decision. unless Congress takes action to change the state of affairs. Manila cigars can come In here now as freely as they did before annexation, when five cents or less was enough to buy n good cigar. Local stocks of Manila cigars arc not large. Those who hnve tho cigars on hand will probably lose nn them. In comparison with what they expected, as the cigars are certain to drop In price. 4 When the organic act wont into enect there were large stocks of Manila clgnrs on hnnd here. Dealers hnd ac cumulated stock, In anticipation of the application of American tariffs between here and the Philippines, dui in in months that have passed since then most of the stock haB beon used up. It Is thought by some thnt Congress will promptly tnke action to shut out Hip cigars from Manlln, as a means of protecting the American tobacco indus try. The Philippines produce an lin-' mouse qunntlty of tobacco and clgarV making Is one of the Industries of ther Islands. With tnrlff barriers down. .Manila cigars will cut a big hole In the business of American manufacturers. The money which the government must pay back, under the ruling Just made, will be clear profit to those who receive It. They have sold the Ma nila cigars at a price which provided for a profit above the tariff. The; smokers have really paid the tariff, and now tho denlers will get It back. When the tariff first went into effect broker Johnson declared It Illegal and advised nil his clients to protest. Events nnve snowed inni ne ciiiien uir on prume Court decision THE AVEATHER.
