workmen out of em ployment paralyze cur industries andset back the growth of the territoiy many years There can be no object gained by reducing the duties on these products sufficient to juslify such enor mous iniury to our people A corres ponding injury by such reduction would be inflicted on the people of all mining states and territories and the destruc tion of silver and lead mining and smelt ing would reduce the annual production of precious metals of the United States 30000000 It would also reduce the entire business of the east with the whole mining region and thus affect the freight
