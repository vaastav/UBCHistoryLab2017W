TALBERT VARDA MAN'S ARRAIGN MKNT OF PRESIDENT WILSON. Vardanian's prepared "interview" which he gave to the press a lew days after President Wilson delivered his message to Congress doubt lurnished excellent thunder for the Republicans and will be used by that party as a campaign document next year to fight the Democrats in an effort to put another Republican n. President in the White House. Like almost ail of Mr Vardanian - utterances, the statement is absolutely illogical; it has neither width or depth and is chiefly re markable for its length and for its fury. In the opening paragraph the Senator wanders off into space and shows that his capacity for the invisible is no less wanting than his capacity for the visible. Figures and dollar marks have always the Senator a sort of mental ahberration. He "predicts' that given within less than twenty years "the expense of a standing army and navy" "together with expenses incurred in past wars" will "cost no less than $20 per capita." When we think of the enormity < Senator's prediction, two billion six hundred million dollars, why. "he does not know the thinness of the ice upon ■f the we realize that which he skateth or the depths of the waters beneath the ice. figures are absurd, business.' and years to construct a battleship and he should also know, what any ordinary mortal does know, that it takes months to muster in nd equip an army. Suppose, for instance, that Germany. Austria Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey the countries that are united on one - :de of the present great war in Europe—should decide to attack < he United States—it takes now only about eight days to cross tile cean, it can therefore be easily seen that these countries, with their battleships and merchant marine ve-sels, could transport an army of one half million men over here within 60 days, and we would have i.nlv an organized army of lOO.OCO men to oppose them. It is true •fat we .vould soon get ready, but let'- stop to consider the loss of His H*e talks of "rushing into the preparedness He knows, or at least should know, that it takes months while 1 the destruction f property we were "getting ur men am ■any.

The Senator is grossly in error in thinking that the people Mississippi ar> not with President Wilson in his desire to •lie lives, the home- and til property ot nur people against aggression. The President has shown iy Ins attitude toward Mexico lhatheis not a war-making President: he has shown the same thing in his efforts and success in pre-erviiig the neutrality of this country as regards the present war, hence it can not be justly and truthfully urged that he is a believer in blood and thunder, a messenger of peace and a believer in peace. The Senator's acknowledged vanity and pompousness nc doubt leads him to say, "all sorts of schemes are being devised to mislead the people and obscure the truth." To him and him alone bt longs whatever honor ( fj can be got for "obscuring the truth and mislead ing the people" of Mississippi nobody would dare compete with him in that field. Roosevelt is also out in a vicious attack on the President, but he attacks from another anglt The attacks of the two mcr are working to the same end. The South is prosperous and will patriotically bear the cost of whatever war preparations the united wisdom of protect its part ol| f Con- 1 press says is necessary. The loyal Democrats of Missis-ippi are willing for All \ arda-I t> r lus man to have whatever glory that the Republicans give assault on the President.
