II MB SHI The War with Spain Officially Brought to a Close by the Peace Commissioners. THE CLOSE WAS A SCENE FOR A PAINTER. TkS DocanMnt Wll Signed at 8:45 p. m., oa the Nltbt of the 10th It Constats of Seventeen Articles, Making 7,500 Words The Spaniards were Badly Depressed Over the Final Action. Paris, Dec. 11. There were two joint sessions of the peace commis sion Saturday, one lasting from 3: SO p. m., to 5:15 p. m., and the other opening at 7 p. in. The long session in the afternoon and the sub sequent recess were due only to the iact that each article of the treaty had to be carefully read and compared in Spanish and English, and to the fact that the engrossing of the last article in Spanish was incomplete. During the wait the commissioners were pho tographed. The treaty was signed at 8:45 p. m. A SCENE FOR A PAINTIXG. 1 The signing of the treaty would have afforded a subject for a great historic painting. The group gathered about the table in the stately chamber of the foreign office was impressive in itself, while the fact that the sense of the momentounness of the issues which the act decided was deeply felt by all the participants gave an impressive and solemn tone to the scene. Around the great mahogany table sat the ten arbiters of the destinies of an old and a young nation. Ranged, standing be hind them, were numerous attaches of the American commission. The jets from the crystal chandeliers above the heads of those present magnified the brilliant green and scarlet of the up holstering in their gaudiness. There was the attraction of a contrast be tween the black clothed actors and the scenery. i To the Americans it was a happy ending of the epilogue of war; for the Spaniards it was plainly a bitter trage dy, none the less painful because long foreseen. They sat silently, as though almost crushed, and none could with hold sympathy for Senor Montero Jtios, the president of the Spanish com mission, who, coming from his bed, was bundled in a great overcoat, though logs were burning in the fire place near by. The spirits of the two bodies were symbolized by the clothes ,worn by the members of the commis sion, for the Americans were attired In evening dress for the dinner given them immediately after the meeting by the Due d'Loubat, and the Span iards wore black frock coats. Although the commissions met at 3:30 o'clock, expecting to finish their work in half an hour, the engrossing of the treaty on parchment was found to be so troublesome that it delayed the signing of the document until 8:20 o'clock. Clerk Martin, of the American commission, worked all day without even stopping to eat. When he came into the chamber at 7:30 with the document he found the com missioners waiting. The Spanish copy had arrived a half hour earlier. 

ORDER OF SIGNATURES. Mr. Arthur Ferguson then proceed ed to read first the English, and after that the Spanish, version of the treaty. This finished, two copies were passed around the table, the commissioners signing them in the order of their rank William R. Day, Senator Cushman K. Davis, Senator William P. Frye, Whitelaw Reid and Senator George Gray; Senor Montero Rios, Senor Abarzuza, Senor Garnica, Senor Villaurutia and Gen. Cerero y Saons, each commission signing its opponent's treaty, lioth were tied with the Spanish and American col ors. When the seals were affixed, at tendants were sent scurrying for rib bons of the French tri-color, with which the documents were sealed, in compliment to the French hosts of the commission. Many officials interested watched every detail of the proceeding. The last seal being impressed, the com missioners rose, and, without formali ty, each member shook the hands of all his antagonists, and each gave as surances of sincere personal esteem. The Spaniards afterward comment ed acridly upon what they termed the bad taste of the Americans in muster ing a crowd of attaches to gloat over the consummation of their downfall and to scramble for relics. The signing was finished nt 8:45. At that time the door of the chamber opened.and Senor Villaurutia appeared and exclaimed to a group of corre spondents who were waiting in the corridor: "C'Est FIni." The other members of the Spanish commission followed Senor Villaurutia and passed silently through the vestibule to their waiting carriages. The American com mission strolled out, chatted compla cently, and as the descended the" steps the lights in the chamber were darkened. Bonus to Leave Ban Franetaco for Hong Kong December 44. Washington, Dec. 11. Naval Con structor Hobson has been at the de partment in connection with orders to proceed to Hong Kong, to supervise the reconstruction of the cruisers Don Juan De Austria, Isla De Cuba and Isla De Luzon.

Mr. Hobson will sail on the steamer leaving San Francisco on December 24, so he will spend Christmas at sea. The Pottery Syndicate Secure an Exten sion of Its Option. Trenton. N. J.. Dec. 12.

It is intimated that the ab sorption may also include the sanitary potteries now being operated by tha arenton pottery syndicate. THE TIDE OF TRADE. Soaad Money an I Good Crops Bare Broag-ht an Era of Great Prosperity. Tha enormous orders which railroads have placed for steel rails .are the most significant illustrations of the great revival In business in this coun try since the election. The Iron Age, the standard authority in the trade, says in its current issue that no less than 700,000 tons have been tiken this week, which means prosperity for the mills next year. This represents only a part of the immense business that will be done, for many roads have not yet placed their orders, but are preparing to do so. From excellent information at hand the Age concludes that the production will reach 2,000,000 tons in 1699. Three western railroads alone have ordered 180,000 tons, one taking 75,000. Their orders for new cars are on a similar scale, and altogether it seems that the heavy purchasing which the mills have been expecting from the roads since the 1600 election has at last begun. The railroads are making the start in the outlays which have been required for a general revival of business. Soon the other lines cf trade and manufac tures will follow. Confidence that was first restored in our currency and financial institutions is now returning in every direction. Railroads did not buy rails heavily, though they needed them, until they could be assured that the return of good times would not be checked by the danger of further sil ver legislation, and they could tell that the results of two good crops had given the country a basis upon which it could depend for freights outside of grain. The same thing has been true in prac tically nearly every other great line of trade. Money was plenty atd credit good, but the wheels of progress were clogged until the road was cleared far ahead. Last year thcreAvere fine crops, high prices and a general winding up of old debts, but people had not that confidence in the future necessary to buying operations which make not a few lines of trade but a vhole country busy and prosperous. At last the swelling of the tide is general, and it is so recognized in Eti- rope as well as in America. Every line of business Is becoming buoyant, with few exceptions. The demand for labor Is such that few men are unemployed if they want work. Advertisements for all sorts of help appear in the newspa pers, to whose columns sucn announce ments have long been strangers. Even cotton manufacturing, to long oe pressed, is now rallying, and soon will be prosperous. It will follow the up heaval in iron and steel, of which the strongest indication is given in the im mense railroad orders. The country never was so rich, and Its currency system has not for 0 years been so free from danger of at tack. The first result of abundant funds and the assurance that no revolution was to be attempted in the monetary standard has been a wild rush to place Investments in bonds and fixed se curities. What is coming now is the withdrawal of money from bonds and its employment in active trade. In short, we are upon the eve of another great era of development which will discount that of 1S80-1890. Louisville Courier-Journal (Dem.). A GREAT TIME AHEAD. nch a Season of Prosperity as the World Sever Has Known. Never In the history of the American people were their business affairs in such promising condition as they are at the present time. Wherever we look the evidence of prosperity is found. Our exports are phenomenally large and there is every indication that they will grow to even greater dimensions. There was a time when we sold only raw materials, but now our manufac tured products are finding such favor in the eyes of the world that our Eu ropean rivals in trade have reason for alarm. In a letter to the New York World George Rutledge Gibson, refer ring to this aspect of the question, says: "As a result, we have at our command an enormous international trade bal ance which we can convert into gold at any time, but we have what is more im portant than that, a relief from the gold drain to Europe, which for several years threatened gold payments in this country. While free silver men were egitating their policy gold was fleeing away and the very underpinning of our gold standard was being withdrawn. This process went on for some time in conjunction with a treasury situation which was weakened by monthly defi cits. The whole economic drift has now changed. We have so far this year im ported $130,000,000 more gold than we have exported, we have produced and put into monetary circulation more gold thau any year within 30 years, and wc have at our beck and call millions of European gold in the form of bills of exchange carried by our bankers." We continue to be the granary of the world; populism, it is believed, is dis appearing; the silver question no longer excites serious alarm, though it will continue to be agitated; this country will not engage in war again for many years. So everything is promising for i uch a reason of prosperity as the world never has known. Albany Journal. The West on Sliver. There is much of hopeful promise in the views of Senator McBride, of Ore gon, set forth through an interview to wit: "The result in the west marks the return to the raciflc coast states to the republican column. Washington and California have only followed the excellent example that was set by Ore gon last June, and I think are both permanently with the republican party. The west has been sharing splendidly in the prosperity of President McKin ley's administration and in the bene fits of a protective tariff. This is one of the causes of the revolt in the politi cal views of Pacific coast voters. But the farmers have been receiving excel lent prices for their agricultural prod ucts. Wheat, wool, hops and other farm products have brought high prices, and there has been a constant demand. The farmers of Washington, like those of Oregon, raise diversified crops, and all these farmers have shared in the good times. The election has demonstrated that these farmers have returned to the republican party, and that others, impregnated with free sil ver ideas, are disposed - to abandon them." Washington Post. HIS 

PLEDGES HOLD GOOD. President McKinley Will Keep Kvrry Promise Made at Bis Election. President McKInley's message to the people of the west, delivered by H. H. Hanna at the meeting of the New York chamber of commerce a few days ago Is an emphatic reiteration of his mes sage to congress last year. "What word," said Mr. Hanna on parting with the president, "can I take back to the people of the west regarding the cur rency?" The president replied: "Tell them 1 stand firmly for monetary legislation, and that I am determined that every pledge the republican party mada along this line shall be kept." Why is this message sent especially to the west? Simply because, to the honor of the west, it is here that the demand for the fulfillment of the republican pledges of 1S90 are most insistent. The president has been reading the return! from the west. He interprets correctly the magnificent majority in Ohio to mean an indorsement alike of the per formances and promises of his adminis tration. So, too, of the round plurality of 69,000 in Illinois, 25,000 in Indiana, 74,000 in Michigan, 63,000 in Iowa, 30,000 In Wisconsin, and sound money gains everywhere west to the Golden Gate that opem outward to our island em pire. The president makes no new prom ises. Nor does he give any intimation of favoring any of the currency reform measures before the present congress. He knows that no relief is possible in that quarter. But from his message of December 6, 1S97, we know that Presi dent McKinley is committed to mone tary measures that shall -"1. Place the currency and obligations of the United States on the gold basis by statute. "2. Impound redeemed greenbacks so that they shall not be reissued except for gold. thereby breaking the 'endless chain. "3. Grant to national banks the right to Issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they deposit for circulation and re duce the tax on such circulation to one-half of one per cent." There need be no caucusing of repub lican leaders during the coming session to unite upon these propositions. There are not differences of opinion to be reconciled about them. There is no novelty or intricacy of system involved in them. They stand forth as the ob vious and self-evident means to secure the gold standard, break the "endless chain" of repeated redemption and give greater elasticity to our currency. No preliminary conference of party leaders was necessary to the calling of the extra session of 1897 for tariff re form, and none is needed to adjust dif ferences as to monetary reform before the extra session. The divergence of views as to national banking and cur rency that cannot be brought together in the discussion of the extra session can be relegated to the regular session. The people of the west send greeting to Presidnt McKinley and beg to ex press their confidence in his determina tion to call an extra session of the Fifty sixth congress in March that the re publican party at the first opportunity may keep its pledges of 189G and 1S98 in regard to monetary legislation.
