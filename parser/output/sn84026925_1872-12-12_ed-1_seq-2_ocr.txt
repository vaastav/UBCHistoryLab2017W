The slave trade is in a more flourishing condition than it has been for a good many years. During the last year 20,000 slaves have been exported from the eastern coast of Africa, and as the great maritime powers of Europe, with the single exception of Great Britain, have declined to cooperate with the United States for its suppression, it seems probable that the traffic will increase rather than decrease in the future. Statistics of fire, recently compiled, show that #76,000,000 were lost through isolated conflagrations in the United States within the space of two years, the great Chicago and Boston conflagrations not being considered. Twelve per cent, of these fires owed their origin to accident with kerosene. Eighteen per cent of the fires which occurred in New York in a single year were due to the same cause.

He was chosen unanimously, an unprecedented occurrence in the annals of any people, and it is believed that after all the turmoil and excitement, Mexico will yet settle down into a quiet, orderly and prosperous life. With land of unequalled fertility, genial skies and a delightful climate, it could be made a prosperous country. As yet there seems to be no solution to the Alabama legislative muddle. Both Legislative bodies continue to hold regular sessions, though neither has perfected any business. A committee from each Legislature is in Washington pressing their respective claims before the administration. Attorney-General Williams has given both sides a hearing, but is silent as to the claims of either delegation. No cause is shown to exist for federal interference, and it is understood that the government will not interfere unless something should arise under the jurisdiction of the constitution of the United States which shall render necessary the intervention of federal authority. Gabrielle, the youngest daughter of Mr. Greeley, whom he was fond of calling "Pussy," was in attendance on her father during his illness, but her grief was so very uncontrollable that her uncle brought her with him to his home in New York city on Thursday night. His daughter Ida was with him night and day. So violent did he become that it was found necessary to remove most of the furniture from the room. Atone time he tore the watch presented to him by the employees of the Tribune apart, and again he threw a kerosene lamp on the floor, setting the room on fire and narrowly escaping being burned to death. As his strength left him he became more quiet, but did not show any signs of consciousness until about an hour before his death. Louisiana is the next State to become involved in complications arising from the last election of members of the Legislature. Gov. Warraoth has convened in extra session the members as reported by his wing of the Republican party to have been elected; his object being, as is alleged, to secure his own election to the U. S. Senate. The adherents of the Custom House or Grant faction claim a different result from that promulgated by Warmoth, and United States soldiers have taken possession of the capitol building and the Governor's office. Two Legislatures will probably meet. In the meantime the United States Attorney-General telegraphs to the U. S. Marshal that he must enforce the decrees and mandates of the United States Courts, no matter by whom resisted and that all necessary troops for that purpose will be furnished. The New York Journal of Commerce says: "Yesterday the quotation committee of the New York Cotton Exchange were presented with a boll of cotton which has beeu acknowledged by experts to be the largest and most remarkable yet shown in this "market, j The presentation was made by Mr. French, j of Messrs. Morton, Bliss & Co. The boll has j spread in a peculiar fan-like form, from a ! large, strong stem. It was grown from ira- i 'proved Dixon seed, cultivated by F. C. & John Morehead, of Catalpa plantation, Wash-' ington county, Mississippi. The sample shows ! the improvement by selection and cultivation, ' which has taken place in four years, from first experiments. This boll contains twenty- j four seed-cells. The seed was planted May ; 24. The plant was injured by drought and worms to some extent ; but six hundred bolls , were counted on some of the stalks. Many j of the bolls were of the ordinary form. The planters expect to improve the seed so that it' may produce ten pounds of lint cotton to the ' stalk. The boll is now on exhibition to mem-! bers at the Cotton Exchange." Referring to the fact that during this short Congress of only three months duration , several large lobby schemes will be pushed, among others the World thus speaks of the , proposed refunding of the cotton tax: Anoth-, er subject which will be pressed upon Congress, this winter, by a powerful lobby, is the refund-1 ing of the cotton tax. We earnestly fought that tax when it was imposed, for reasons which we still believe sound. But the pretence of repaying it covers one of the most gigantic and most corrupt jobs even of this degenerate time. If Congress could restore the money to those from whom it was really taken, it might be very well; but that is as impracticable as it would be to take the water from j the bed of the Mississippi, and reconvey it by , artifical means to the thousand millions of acres of oozing soil which feed the first sources of the river. The tax came out of the wages of plantation hands; it came out of the lessees or owners of cotton lands ; it came out of the great mass of the cotton-growing community. If it were granted back, the lion's share would go to the colossal ring of lobbyists and cotton dealers who are pushing this scheme, and the rest to various cotton factors scattered through the South. The amount of the tax is ?70,000,000, and we have learnt, from an authentic source, that there is a settled bargain that the cotton ring shall have one-half of it, or $35,000,000, if they succed in carrying the job through Congress. ?hs ^orhvillc (?nquiw. 

YORKVILLE. S. C.: THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 12,1872. UMTEI) STATES SENATOR. Just as we go to press, we learn by private telegram that John J.

THE NEW TAX LEVI. The Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives have reported a new tax levy, which will very probably be adopted. It provides five mills for the expenses of the fiscal year commencing November, 1872: two mills for schools; five mills for deficiencies; and three mills for county purposes; making in the aggregate fifteen mills, or one dollar and fifty cent3 on the 8100 valuation of property. ?.? IMPORTANT STATE PAPERS. On the first page of this issue we publish the greater portion of the President's Message, and the Iuaugural Address of Governor Moses. The former document has met more general approval by the public at large than any paper that has yet emanated from President Grant. The Inaugural Address of Governor Moses will be perused by our State readers with j interest. It is, upon the whole, conceived in better spirit than we had expected, and it remains to be seen how faithfully he will fulfill the fair promises in which his address abounds. His appeal to the former ruling class, as he terms his recent political opponents in the gubernatorial contest, will, we feel sure, be not in vain ; but in their efforts to maintain the honor and dignity of the State and uphold her public credit, they will expect a corresponding effort on the part of the officials whose sworn duty it is so to do. We are confident it is the desire of no citizen to throw the least obstacle in the way of the incoming administration ; while we fully believe all, without regard to political affiliation, will second the executive in any and every honest effort to redeem our State from the existing evils of the bad government of the past. 

AGRICULTURAL FACTS. We have long been of the opinion that York county is, all things considered, one of the best places on this continent. We do not say this in a boastful spirit; but we are convinced that the man who cannot make a good living in York county, can make it noplace on the face of the broad earth. Nature has done as much to make York county a desirable place to live and die as she has done for any land on which the sun shines. The society nf Vnrlr pmmtv is ns ornnd ns it. is in Jinv VV .. J -b J I land. Our people are a moral people, aud at least of more than average intelligence. We believe York is the banner county so far as education is concerned. But we set out to state some facts of an agricultural nature. East of Yorkville, eight miles, on the road leading from Chester to Thorn's Ferry, a gentleman from North Carolina bought one hundred and fifty acres of land. He paid for the tract five hundred dollars. The greater quantity of the plantation is what iu this region is called "old-field." He planted about thirty acres of it this year in wheat, corn, peas and cotton. He made four bales of cotton worth two hundred and eighty dollars; forty bushels of wheat, worth at least sixty dollars; one hundred and fifty-seven bushels of core, wortli one hundred and seventeen dollars; peas, fodder, hay and shucks to the amount of fifty dollars. By adding up these several sums it will be seen that the produce of thirty acres paid for the one hundred and fifty. It may be said that it will take all he made to support his family. No. He rented an adjoining place, and made on that, after paying rent, enough to support his family. But some one will say, it will take a large amount of all that he made on both places to pav for labor. We say, no, again. He and his sous did the work. We predict that in ten years from to-day there will be no land in York county tosell at three dollars per acre. Somebody will find out the value of our old-fields. PROCEEDINGS^F CONGRESS. In the Senate on Tuesday the 3rd, before the reading of the journal was concluded, Mr. Cameron moved to dispense with its further | reading and no objection being made, the reading was dispensed with. Mr. Cameron then moved an adjournment, which was agreed to. In the House a number of bills were introduced on leave and referred to appropriate committees. Mr. Beck was excused from serving on the Credit Mobilier Committee, and Mr. Merrick, of Maryland, was appointed in his stead. Mr. Scofield, of Pennsylvania, from the Committee on Naval Affairs, reported a bill to authorize the construction of ten or more steam vessels of war, which, after a lengthy discussion, in which several members participated, was postponed for further consideration. On the 4th, the Senate elected Senator Anthony, President pro fewiand immediately adjourned. The House was engaged during most of the session in considering District of Columbia affairs. A bill to authorize the construction of ten sloops of war was referred to the Committee on Appropriations. In the Senate on the 5th, Mr. Sumner asked, on account of ill health, to be excused from j serving on any committee. Mr. Rice endeav- j ored to call up his resolution asking why 1 troops have been or are to be sent to Arkan- j sas ; but Mr. Edmunds objected. Mr. Pome-. roy introduced a bill to prohibit the sale or manufacture or importation of intoxicating | liquors in the District of Columbia or in the Territories. Mr. Cameron gave notice that he would call up at an early day the bill in relation to the French spoliation claims. In the House a bill was introduced to incorporate a banking association with a capital of not less than 8100,000,000, under the style of "The Governors' and Managers' Exchequer of the United States." The sloops-of-war bill was then resumed. Various amendments were proposed and agreed to?one requiring half the number to be built in private ship. yards ; another that each vessel shall not carry exceeding ten guns ; and another, that only six vessels shall be constructed, and requiring plans and estimates to be reported before the ! work is commenced. With these amendments the bill was passed. In the Senate on the 6th, the resolution of ! inquiry of the President why troops were sent j to Arkansas was resumed and discussed without definite action. A resolution was also | adopted that the Committee on Finance be in- j j structcd to inquire what legislation is necessa- j ' ry to relieve the present stringency of the | money market, the propriety of providing for I an additional issue of legal tender notes, and ! all matters connected therewith, and report | by bill or otherwise at as early a day as prac! ticable. In the House, Harris, of Virginia, i introduced a bill paying for property destroyed j during the war by authority of the United I States. Mr. Dawes, from the Committee of | ' i Ways and Means, reported a bill abolishing i the offices of assessor and assistant assessor of ' the Internal Revenue, and transferring their duties to collectors and deputy collectors. Amendments were agreed to fixing the time for the bill to go into operation on the 1st of July, 1873, and requiring collectors to givo additional bonds for their new duties, and the bill was passed. House adjourned to Monday. In the Senate, on the 9th, the conference report on the bill to regulate the construction of bridges over the Ohio was concurred in. A resolution for a special committee to consider the question of cheap transportation from the West to the seaboard was introduced, but being objected to, was laid over. In the House a number of bills were introduced and referred?among them one to amend the constitution so as to authorize Congress to fix a uniform time for State elections ; one repealing the tax on spirits made entirely from fruits; one to repeal the ironclad oath ; one to extend the Southern Claims Committee four years. Also a resolution to remove all political disabilities. A motion to suspend the rules and pass bills removing all political disabilities failed to receive a twothirds vote by yeas 102; nays 84. The Civil Rights bill was discussed and finally buried by referring it to the Committee on the Revision of the Laws.

In those ten counties there j were in operation during the time above spec ified, 318 fruit distilleries, from which we should reasonably infer that not an apple was wasted; but nevertheless the finest quality of fruit is slow sale in Greensboro at 25 cents per bushel. ? The North Carolina Senatorial contest was decided on the eighth day after the balloting commenced by the election of A. S. Merrimon, the defeated candidate of the Democratic party for Governor. Gov. Vance was the regular nominee of the party caucus, and received the support of all the Democratic members except fifteen, who persistently vo-! ted for Merrimon. Perceiving the impossi- j bility of an election, the way matters existed, j Vance withdrew his name; but on the final ballot he and Merrimon only were voted for, Vance receiving 80 votes and Merrimon 87. j The entire Republican strength of the Legis-; lature supported Merrimon, and by that par-| ty his election is regarded as almost a politi- j cal victory, ami the Democratic papers, ex- j cepting the Raleigh Sentinel, also regard the j result us a Republican triumph.

C., Dec. 6, 1872. the lakes to the capitol. My last letter to the Enquirer was from Buffalo, New York. Buffalo is only about thirty miles from Niagara Falls, and I could have continued my journey that far, but, upon deliberation, concluded not to do so. There is less to see at the Falls in winter than in summer. I mean less that is enjoyable to see. To stand out in some bleak place and look at an ice-rimmed fall of water, where the fierce winds cut you and snow pelts you in the face, is not the top notch of human enjoyment. Then whenever a man goes there, winter or summer, he has to submit to legalized robbery. This noblest of nature's works has been prostituted to the use of a den of swindlers. My advice to the reader is to keep away from Niagara Falls as long as there is any other place on earth to go to. If you have an abundance of money, however, and don't mind being swindled, why, then pack up and go to the falls, and stay till your money is out, which will be in about a week, unless you have a bank. I left Buffalo in a snow storm. The wind blew and the snow flew. (No extra price for poetry.) I walked to the depot 011 account of the epizootic. Most of the horses up there have got the "old epizoo," as the people playfully call it. Soon the storm lulled and we flew along over the Lake shore road, upon the bank of the beautiful Erie, at the rate of forty miles an hour. We got ahead of the storm, ran away from it and left it to howl and rage in the rear. We got to Cleveland for supper, making the run of nearly two hundred miles in about six hours. We were landed in an immense passenger depot, through which trains thunder all the time. The traveler will get a good supper at Cleveland for seventy-five cents. At all the larger depots in the north, lunch rooms are provided, where a mau can get a handsome lunch at a very moderate cost. A cup of coffee, sandwich and piece of mince-pie will cost hira only twenty-five cents. These tidy lunch rooms, with everything about them neat and clean, and really good fare at low prices, are seldom seen in the south. There the traveler must pay a dollar for a hasty meal, and not get what he wants at that, unless it is the dyspepsia. Leaving Cleveland after dark, the Cincinnati passengers awake next morning in the Queen city. The weather moderated some, and only now and then were there patches of snow to remind one of winter. From Cincinnati I came direct to Washington by way of the Pennsylvania Central route. People were flocking into the city from all directions, to attend the meeting of Congress, and the trains were crowded. The one that brought me here had eight cars, all full. 

WASHINGTON Is not a very inviting place to the stranger, after he has been here a few days and seen what there is to see. Unless he has business, he will get tired in a week and want to go home, where he ought to have staid in the first place. It costs one about twice as much to live here as in anv other citv between the two ~ " ml 1 I oceans. The inhabitants seem to make it a point to realize enough out of a session of Congress to last them until the next session. The charge for board, at the first-class hotels, is five dollars a day. For a fire you must pay a dollar extra, and by the time a few other extras have come in you will find your bills running up to the tune of seven dollars a day. There are hotels here at three and four dollars a day that are very good. Prices for board in the private boarding houses, vary from twelve to twenty dollars a week. Those who remain all the year round may have deductions, but it is impossible to live anything like respectably on less than twelve dollars. Senators and Congressmen who come here with their families and live in style, at the best hotels, have to pay for it roundly. There is a Senator here with his wife and daughter, who pays four hundred dollars a month. Another, with finer apartments, pays three hundred dollars a week. So you see you can live as expensively as you like. The salary of a Congressman is five thousand dollars a year and mileage, &c., which brings it to six or seven thousand. Most of: them save money. Others who are rich, spend j more than they earn. Some come here for a "good time," and don't mind expense. While speaking of salaries, it is said that the President saves not more than half his, but; I don't believe it. He is economical, and the i government furnishes about twenty thousand I dollars Worth of "extras," such as servants' hire, etc. Grant ought to live on less than ten thousand a year. But he is rich, being worth j well up to three hundred thousand dollars. j The Vice-President gets eight thousand a year. Colfax is an economical person, and | saves a part of his salary. The cabinet offi- j cers receive the same. Secretary Fish spends his and twenty thousand dollars a year besides, j He is enormously rich,and lives like a prince. | He cares nothing for the office except the I honor. Society people here won't hear to his i being removed from the Cabinet; he gives such nice dinners,you know! The other Cabinet officers are not wealthy J with the exception of Delano. He is rich and | close. He saves his salary and lives away ; down at the bottom of his income. The heads of Bureaus receive from three to j six thousand a year. There is great inequali- j ty. Some receive twice as much as others and do a less amount of work. The treasury clerks are paid twelve, fourteen, sixteen and eighteen hundred dollars a year, according to capacity. The lady clerks, of whom there are a large number, are paid eight, ten, twelve and fourteen hundred dollars. There is a great clamor for more all around the board, but I hope there will be no increase except in a very few cases. If an official don't like the pay he can "go west." There are plenty who will do the work well for the price. But I have got clear off my subject as usual. Will do better next time. Nemo. THE U. S.

.TITSTTPF 1 AlVliUUAl -M, V* V i Washington, December 5, 1872. J "Robert K. Scott, Columbia, S. C.:?I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communicatian of the 16th ultimo, addressed to the President, and by him referred to me, enclosing the appeal of the grand jurors of York and Chester counties, in South Carolina, in behalf of the citizens of those counties who are now confiued in the penitentiary at Albany and in the jails of the State of New York, under sentence for violating the Enforcement Act of Congress. Senator Robertson, Judge Mackey, the Governor, the Attorney-General and the Secretary of State of South Carolina, with others, endorse their concurrence upon these appeals. ' "I have to say, in answer, that in my judgment it is not only impracticable but improper to grant an indiscriminate pardon to the citizens'of York and Chester counties, who have been convicted of violating the Enforcement Act, or to any persons described only by !, the locality in which they reside, or designa- j ted as a class of offenders against the laws of! the United States. I have no means of knew-! ing the names, numbers or degrees of guilt of!< the citizens of said counties now imprisoned < as represented in said appeals. < "Separate applications for pardon ought to ! i be made by or on behalf of each of said persons, stating substantially the circumstan ces of the crime and conviction. When such i an application is made it will be considered without delay, and as favorably as the Presi-! : dent's sense of justice will permit. Very respectfully, GEO. H.

The disease is of a mild type, and is said to yield readily to simple treatment We have heard of no deathe as yet. BARN BURNT. About 3 o'clock on Thursday morning last, the barn and stables of Thomas P. Whisonant, about fourteen miles east of town, was discovered to be on fire. The buildings, with their contents?a large quantity of hay, fodder aud other forage?were soon destroyed. A valuable horse and mule were also burnt with the stables. The loss will reach fully twelve hundred dollars. The fire is supposed to have been the work of an incendiary. Mr. Whisonant and his wife were both absent from home on the night of the burning, the only persons on the premises being the children of the family and a negro woman. "THE ORPHANS' APPEAL.** The December number of this beautiful little paper, issued by the Board of Trustees of the Palmetto Orphan Home, is on our ta ble. Of this little paper, the Barnwell Sentinel says, "every family in the county should subscribe for the Orphans' Appeal, to instruct and amuse the little ones around the hearthstone." The Appeal is giving a history of the rise and progress of the Palmetto Orphan Home, which will be continued in each issue. The price of the Appeal is only 50 cents a year. Every person who gives 50 cents for the Appeal, gives it to the Orphan Home ; and every one who gives 50 cents or more to the Home, will get the Appeal for one year. Direct "Orphan's Appeal," Columbia, S. C. THE PALMETTo'oRPHAN HOME. A few days ago we received a call from Rev. Tilman R. Gaines, the general agent of the Palmetto Orphan Home, located in Columbia. We are pleased to learn from him that the institution is in a promising condition, and that he is meeting with considerable encouragement in raising the necessary funds for purchasing a suitable building and grounds, in order.that the usefulness of the institution may be increased. At present there are sixteen orphans in the "Home," which are all that can be provided for at this time ; but so soon as the new buildings and grounds can be procured, the facilities for usefulness will be largely increased. The enterprise is one that commends itself to every individual, and is entitled not only to sympathy, but material support. Colonel A. B. Springs, at Fort Mill, and the Proprietor of the Enquirer, at Yorkville, will take pleasure in receiving and forwarding donations for the support of this worthy institution. 

WANT OF* HOUSES. Every year, and particularly at this season, when changes and removals take place, there is a great demand for houses?especially dwellings. Not only are many families already residing here put to inconvenience on account of the scarcity of dwellings, but could the houses be obtained, a considerable accession would be made to the population of the town?the good results arising from which are too obvious to require enumeration. Shops and mechanical pursuits of all kinds would spring up, and all classes would be benefitted. The population of Yorkville is limited only by the number of houses it contains. Twenty or more additional dwellings would readily find occupants and make remunerative returns to the owners. We do not think a better opportunity could offer than is here presented for safe and profitable investment by building houses. Those who have capital to invest would by this means not only increase their own wealth, but add to the material prosperity of the town. THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE. Tuesday, December 3. In the Senate, Mr. Donaldson introduced a resolution that, whereas an Act entitled "An Act to provide for the formation of religious, charitable and educational associations," approved February 28, 1870, provides a simple, effectual and inexpensive mode of incorporating fill oh ?<wnpifltinns r and whereas Acts of incorporations of such associations by the General Assembly involves a large and useless expenditure for public printing; therefore, be it resolved, that no leave be granted during the present session for the introduction of such bills in the Senate.

The bill requiring a bond from County Commissioners before entering upon the duties of their office, caused quite a lengthy debate, which was participated in by Messrs.
