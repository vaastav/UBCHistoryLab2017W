YORK. Dec. 7.?The world's diminishing fnel rop ply, and the lack of scientific method to meet the situation, formed the chief topic at the opening session today of tho an nual meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Engineers of national prominence declared that checking the waste of fuel is vital to the Industrial supremacy of the Unitea States. Well known and well tried methods of conservation wtonld save between 75 million and 100 million tons of coal each year, declared David M. Myers, formerly of the Engineering section of the United States Fuel administration. ? Based upon conser vation of 75 million tons, he said, the money saving would be H50.000.000. Tho principal agencies of waste, he said, are boiler plants, coal consumed in old fashioned coke ovens, coal consumed In domestic heating, in which it is estimated that only 12 per cent, of the coal is used, and improper use of steam after Its generation. One of the moat sensible fuel conservation meth ods for a householder is use of coke, said O. P. Hood, chief mechanical engineer, U. S. Bureau of Mines. BABIES BECOMING PURSE SNATCH One Precocious Highway man Was Rounded Up This Morning At noon today Chief Snider suc ceeded in locating the little girl who stole a purse yostedday be longing to Mrs. Arthur Lynch and : made her escape from a local store.

Chief Snider then went to the Mc Cray flats on Madison stroet, ac companied by Mrs. Lynch, and the purse and its contents were recov ered. The mothe- of the little girl told J a number of conflicting stories ana it was the opinion o{-Ctii$t .Snider that the woman was an accesaoiy, 'feorfitar owner of the-purtc-waa -on willing to prosecute, being content with the recovery of'H'Jrr property. Another similar theft-was report ed to the police this afternoon from another store on Main street Mrs. Lafayette Wolff, a colored woman from Monon, lost a purse contain ing MO in cash and some papers. ' This time, the thief w^s a girl aged 'about ten years, wearing a tam-o ! shanter. In this case, also, one of tbo employes of the store witnessed ; the theft and no difficulty Is ex j pected In locating the girl. J Only one arrest was made by the police last night, John McCue was ! brought in on a charge of being drunk but was liberated* shortly afterward on a $5 deposit made by ' his wife, who said that John was neodod at a local restaurant where he Is employed. The |5 was for feited this morning for non-ap pearance.
