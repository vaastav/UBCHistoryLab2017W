FOR A UNION STATION Conference Today Between Senator McMillan and President Cassatt A NEW BIL, TO BE DRAWN Massachusetts Avenue Site for Station Urged Upon Railroad. THE SOUTHERN LINES The location of the new union depot pro posed to be.built In this city was the sub ject of an important conference In the room of the Senate committee on the District of Columbia today. Mr. H. A. Cassatt, pres ident of the Pennsylvania railroad, was present, accompanied by Mr. Brown, chief engineer of the road, and other officials. Senator McMillan, chairman of the District committee, and Mr. Burnham, chairman of the park commission. which has under con sideration the beautitiction of the entire District. were the other chief members of the conference. During the progress and after the exchange of views that was car ried on. Senator Allison, chairman of the Senate committee on appropriations, and other prominent leaders of the Senate, vis ited the room and discussed the project with Mr. Cassatt. Mr. Cassatt, after a general discussion, appeared t view quite favorably the propo sition. which has been put into form by Mr. Birnham, for the location of the union station north of Massachusetts avenue and east of North Capitol street. Plans were exhibited showing not only this, but other locations, with their relation to existing street car lines, and other conditions affect ing their practical operation. so that a com parison could be made on the merits of the Various sites. At the conclusion of the con ference Mr. Cassatt visited the Massachu setts avenue site and then took a train for Philadelphia. A Bill to Be Introduced. Senator McMillan will draw up a bill which he will shortly introduce in the Sen ate amending the railroad bills passed by the last Congress, providing for the elimina tion of grade crossings, and so forth, and the improvement of the terminal stations of the Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad companies. This bill will be drawn in relation to the proposed Massachusetts avenue site. Of course. the introduction of the bill and its promotion will naturally be affected by the attitude of the Pennsylvania Railroad Com pany. because it would hardly be practica ble to force such a measure if there should be forcible opposition on the part of that company. President Canatt*X Position. The confer nce this morning lasted sev eral hours. Mr. Cassett indicated the en tire willingness of the Pennsylvania Rail road Company to co-operate in the recon struction of its terminal facilities in this city with thcse who are interested in the beautification of the capital. He exprcssed his gratification that there was such a strong sentiment being crystalized for beautifying the District of Columbia, and said that as an American citizen he nat urally felt pride in seeing this work suc cessful, and that so far as would be con sistent with his duties as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company he would endeavor to co-operate in a manner that would bring about the best results. so far as railroad trackage and terminal facilities were concerned. He expressed his willingness to have the Pennsylvania railroad tracks removed from the Mall, and said that his company had determined that it was desirable from sev eral standpoints to have a union station on the site of the proposed station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, north of C street and between North Cap Stol and 1st streets east. He explained that there were many advantages in the location of the Pennsylvania railroad station on the present site of its depot and that were there intense railroad competition those ad vantages would be very great indeed. But in view of the manner of railroad organi zation at the present time, so far as this city was concerned. it would be entirely practical to have the roads join their forces and utilize a single station. The Southern Lines. At the present time the tracks of the Southern railroad coming into this city and proceeding to th street, and the tracks leading from the depot to the navy yard form an obtuse angle by runing on Mary land and Virginia avenues. The park com mission has desired, in view of their plan for the removal of the tracks from the mall, to straighten the course of those tracks. placing them south of Vilrginla and Maryland avenues. This proposition was laid before Mr. Cassatt and he expressed his entire willingness to see it realized, pro xided the railroad company could have In its new location in that section of the city equal facilities with those it now enjoys there. After Mr. ('assatt had expressed his desire and willingness also to have a union station on U street between North Capitol and 1st streets east, Mr. Burnham produced several maps which he had prepared show ig the location of the depot on that site and also on the proposed site north of Mas sac husetts avenue. Cougeatom at the C Street Site. He showed that with the depot located on the brow of the hill at C street there would be a very considerable congestion of street car lines on that street. There were other disadvrantages that he pointed out from an engineering standpoint, and he then produced a map with the site on Man * sachusetts avenue indicated in red. This showed a depot with about eight hundred feet frontage on Massachusetts avenue, large enough to accommodate thirty tracks. According to this plan the tracks at the Southern railroad would be carried from South Washington througit a tunnel underneat h Capitol 1Hi1l and locat ed between the Library and the Capitol. emerging In the depot at Massachusetts avenue and there rising to the level of the tracks t.n the masonry viaduct. The plan for a depot on that site showed a semi eircular space i:nmediately In front of the depot, with the several street railway lines of the city approaching the depot from different streets converging at that point. It showed that unlike the location on C street there would be no congestion of the street car line, but the moat ample faell ities would be provided. The trackage of the proposed union depot on Massachusetts avenue would be about double the track age In both the Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio railroad depots irt this city at present. Mr. Cassatt p'averably Impressed. Mr. Cassatt viewed this plan with a good deal of favor, and said that it seemed to have much merit, and the great interest he took in it indicated to those present that he was viewing It flavorably. At the conclumann of the conference, Mr. Cassatt. accompanIed by Mr. Brown and Mr. Burnham, visited the site onl UNsa ehusetts avenue, and looked over the ground very thoroughly. They all con cluded that a depot there would be eatreme e acssib. se the deosa sections of the elty wrhich would chiefly patronise the sta portunity at that location for architectural display. Streets Would Be Cleared. Under the proposed plan the present road way of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad as it comes into its station at the corner Of New Jersey avenue and C street would be turned into a thoroughfare, which would run directly down to the depot. The plan would contemplate the closing of the two streets Immediately north of Massachu setts avenue. It is believed, however, that this plan would result in closing as few streets as any other that could be devised for a union station on -so large and mag nificent a scale as it Is proposed to make the new station on Massachusetts avenue. Upon leaving the conference Mr. Cassatt said that he would take the matter under serious consideration. He did not give any positive and definite indication of what his own action would be in the matter, but he left the Impression that he viewed the new project with great favor. Compensation Proposed. It Is likely that Senator McMillan will within a very short time introduce in the Senate a bill, which Is to be prepared by him, amending the railroad bills of the last Congress in order that their provisions may be in accordance with the proposed plan to locate the union station on Massachusetts avenue. This bill will provide some means for compensating the Pennsylvania Rail road Company for the valuable public land which it will give up on the mail. Its trackage on the mall at the 1present time occupies a space 400 feet wide and 1,600 feet long. It may be that the compensa tioi for the Pennsylvania railroad will take a money form, but the details of the bill have not been determined. 

MUST MAINTAIN VIGiLANCE. Gen. Chaffee Warns His Troops Against Treacherous Filipinos. Following the unfortunate disaster to the 9th Infantry at Balangiga, when the troops were surprised and overcome by supposedly friendly Filipinos, General Chaffee, the di vision commander, issued a general order designed to guard against future treachery of that kind. "The division commander," says the or der, "calls the attention of all officers and enlisted men of this command to the loss of comrades at Balangiga, Samar, Septem ber 28 last, due to unwatchfulness and un warranted confidence in the professed loy alty and friendship of the inhabitants of the town where the troops were located. For these reasons too much reliance should not be placed on professions of faith and friendship, as yet unproved. Military vigi lance should never be relaxed, and every precaution must be taken to guard against a recurrence of the disaster at Balangiga." GUARD THE ISTHMUS. Capt. Perry Will Retain Part of His Force on Shore. The Navy Department this morning re ceived the following cablegram from Cap tain Perry of the Iowa, commanding! United States naval forces on the isthmus: "PANAMA. December 2. "Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.: "Shall re-embark portion only tomorrow morning; retain remainder for the present. (Signed) "PERRY." This dispatch indicates that Captain Per ry. acting under the discretionary author ity given him by the Secretary of the Navy, has found it advisable to maintain a guard of United States marines at Panama and possibly at other points along the railroad for a short time, in order to Insure uninter rupted traffic across the isthmus. There are now four United States naval vessels guarding both ends of the Panama rail road, two at Panama and two at Colon, and that number will not be reduced so long as there are any prospects of a re viyal of the insurrection against Colombia. THE HOUSE COMMITTEES. Announcement by the Speaker in Ex pected Earlier Than Usual. Speaker Henderson is making up the com mittees of the new Congress as rapidly as possible. He can predict no time, how ever, when this work will be completed. It is the general impression, however, that the committee assignments this year will be announced somewhat earlier than usual. The action of tfie House in adjourning over until Friday will give the Speaker more time to devote to this task. NO MORE HAND CLAPPING. Pages Called in the House by Press ing the Button. The new electric annunciators, put to work this morning for the first time, to summon the House pages to the desks of members are very objectionable to these midget functionaries. Annunciators have been placed In the rear of the House-one for the republicans and one for the demo crats. When a button Is pushed by a mem ber at hjs desk a small red disc appears in the annunciator. The number placed over this disc shows where the page is wanted. The boys' objection to the annunciator Is that it ma kes no noise In Indicating and re qures constant watching. MORE TIME NEEDED. The Industrial Commission Wants Two Months to Complete Its Work. The reason why the term of service of the industrial commission should be ex tended is-set forth in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House by Chairman Clarke of the commission. A bill providing for the extension of the commission washintroduced in the House yesterday by Mr. Gardner of New Jersey. Doeumeats Soaked by the Rain. Much damage was done by the rain today to the documents temporarily stored in Statuary Hall. The old roof has been taken from this section of the Capitol, and the only protection from the rain is a tempo rary scaffolding of rough boards, through which the water came in streams. The documents were covered with canvas as rapidly as possible, but not until many of them were soaked. House Districet Committee's Room. The room whiech has been assigned to the House committee on the District of Colum bia, demands, because of its elegance, an other room in which bills, documents, sta tionery and papers can be stored, and Rep resentative Babcock, who will head that committee, is making a still hunt for such a room. The committee's new room is lo cated on the main floor of the Capitol, in the section made over from the old library quarters. It is furnished In mahogany, has been handsomely frescoed and presents too good an appearance, according to Mr. Bab cock, to be spoiled by unsightly piles or cases of paper. Movements of Naval Vessels. The Essex has sailed from the Port of Spain for St. Kitts, the Atlants, from Mon tevideo for Buenos Ayres, the Wilmington from Shiakwan for Chen iane and the Kentucky from Hong Kong for Amoy.

PHILIPPINE T A R I F F Supreme Court Decision Discussed by Cabinet. A PECIAI EAGE PROBABLE The Refund of Tariff Dues Not a Serious Matter. ACTION AFTER HOLIDAYS Most of the cabinet session today was consumed in a discussion of the decision of the Supreme Court yesterday in the case involving the right of the government to collect duties on goods coming from the Philippine Islands to the United States. It is stated that the decision Is satisfactory to the administration, which now has the pow er, by legislation of Congress, to Impose such tariff duties as it may see fit. It un doubtedly leaves in the hands of Congress the right to make laws regarding customs and all other matters pertaining to the Philippines. As to what these lawswill be or ought to be there is nothing but speculation. It is probable that President Roosevelt w!ll send a special message to Congress at some future time, making recommendations. The decision will bring forward the entire subject of a tariff on goods from the is lands. The various views as to high or low tariff on goods from the islands will be thrashed over, and a fight in Congress is likely as to the tariff policy of the gov ernment applying to its new possessions. The question of refunding the duties col lected in this country on goods from the Philippines was really one of the least im portant matters before the cabinet in con nection with the decision. It is estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury that $1, 000,000 will cover the repayments of cus toms duties. An important question, how ever, is whether the duties collected un der the War Department on goods going into Manila from this country can be re funded under the decision. This would probably be a larger sum than the $1,00,000 already given. A Most Important Question. By far the most important question of all considered by the cabinet is whether the decision of the court does not imme diately apply the Dingley tariff law to the Philippines, as well as immigration laws, coastwise vessel laws and the various other general laws that were applied to Porto Rico when it became a portion of the United States. To apply the naviga tion laws to the islands would be to pre vent foreign vessels from doing a coast wise trade In the islands. Attorney Gen eral Knox himself is not able at this time to answer the questions, and will give se-. rious consideration to them. At the Treas ury Department the opinion prevails that the Dingley laws are now in force in the Philippiges, revoking the tariff laws put in force by the War Department. The tariff duties in the islands are col lected by War Department officials 1.nd employes, but if the Dingley laws apply, the collection will have to pass into the hands of the Treasury Department, and a force of customs collectors and clerks will have to be put on the work. Close atten tion is going to be given the matter both at the Department of Jystice and at the treasury. Temporary Laws Badly Needed. It is regarded as important that Congress should enact temporary laws immediately to clear up the matters in dispute. By do ing this Congress would definitely settle all the questions now obscure and uncer tain, as the Supreme Court declares that Congress has full power to do as it sees fit. It is therefore suggested that Congress ought to at once pass a temporary law that will authorize affairs to be conducted in a positive manner. It could temporarily ap ply the Dingley law to duties collected both in this country and the Philippines and thereby remove an uncertainty, or it could enact the War Department tariff into law for the present. Unless something of this kind is done it is predicted that there will be much confusion. Until Congress does something any amount of goods could come to this country from the Philippines and the treasury could not collect a penny in duty. Likely to Go Over Until After the Holidays. The Supreme Court decision relative to the Philippines has brought to the atten tion of leaders in Congress the need of legislation for the archipelago, somewhat on the lines of that enacted for Porto Rico, and particularly dealing with revenue ques tions and imports from the Philippines. Such legislation will originate in the House of Representatives, and it appears to be conceded that the ways and means commit tee will get up the insular revenue bill, the insular committee dealing only with ques tions outside of those involving revenue. Mr. Payne of New York, former chair man of the ways and means committee, who undoubtedly will continue in that po sition, said today that there had not yet been time to consider the court's decision with reference to the needs of legislation. It was Quite apparent, he said, that Con gress was now called upon to frame some legislation to meet the conditions laid down by the court and the ways and means committee undoubtedly would take up the matter at an early day. But as yet there had been no thought of the terms of the bill and no consultation with the Speaker. Mr. Hopkins of Illinois, another veteran of the ways and means committee, said after coming from the Speaker's room, that he thought there would be no hurry in framing a Pilippine revenue bill, and that the whole subject probably would go over until after the holIdays, in aome quarters there wasn talk today that the Speaker would announce the membership of the ways and means committee very soon, pos sibly this week, owing to the Philippine decision, but there was no authoritative statement as to this.. In any event the House leaders doubtless will prepare the general framework of a Philippine bill before or during the holi days. The committee on the Philippines, of which Senator Lodge is chairman, will deal with the subject in the Senate.

At 11 o'clock this nqorning the committee appointed yesterdag %y Congress to wait Ngon the' PaiNeat *led at the White House and were witf 'the President a few minutes. . They Imparted the time-honored information that Congress was in session and was ready to recei've any communica tion he might have to make. The President answered that he *otod communicate with Congress. Half aft hour later Assistant Secretary Pruden, ILCcompanied by Warren Young, left the White House for the Capi tol with copies of~ the message to deliver to both the branches-of the legislative body. The message went in this year for the first time in print; The two copies for the two houses are pripted on paper of the same size as that which was used hereto fore for the written copies, though the paper is a heavy white, instead of the blue tint which has been in use. Each copy is richly bound in brown morocco, with stiff covers, with simple gold border and letter ing, the words on the front being "Message of the President of the United States, 1901." The printed copies are 4gned by the Presi dent in ink. Lieberth Will Re Nominated. George W. Lieberth,. who was several weeks ago appointed tolector of internal revenue of one of the Wentucky districts to succeed D. N. Comingere, will be nomi nated by the Presideqt. thus terminating the fight that had been begun on him from the minute he had geen appointed. Owing to charges against Lieberth he was not al lowed by the President to take charge cf his office after he had filed his bond and it had been accepted. The decision of the President was reached this morning after a conference with Senator Deboe, Repre sentative Boreing and R. P. Ernst of Cov ington. Ex-Representative Berry was also in the party. Senator Deboe declared that the fight on Lieberta was wholly at the in stigation of Mr. Coirlagore, and he there upon laid before the'President a letter Mr. Comingore wrote sin, time ago heartily indorsing Mr. LiebortR. This was before the latter had become candidate for the collectorship. The rdent said that this satisfied him as to ?. )teberth, and he directed that the nelpfatn of the latter be sent to the Senate without delay. The Kentuckians a Aid .bat Dr. W.

Senator Martin of Vininia called on the President today to irroduce a republican friend, who wants to be postmaster at an office in Roanoke county.Va. This was Judge Griffin. "Mr. President," said Senator Mar tin, "I merely called to introduce my old friend, who wants'to talk with you. I do not ask for anything for him. In fact, I do not think it is in- good taste for democrats to try to advise a republican administra tion about appointments or anything else." Senator Martin did not remain to listen to the talk Judge Griflin'had with the Presi dent. Representative Sulzer of New York called on the President.

ABLE PAPER Comment on the First Nenage of President Roosevelt. BRIEF DIGESf O THE DOCUMENT |p Men of Both Parties Praise Its Construction. SOME EXPRESSIONS The President's message is unique among such state papers In that it devotes a minimum of space to -the foreign relations of the government, mentioning only the Chinese situation at length, and that at the close of the paper. The custom here tofore has been for the message to be main ly devoted to foreign relations, those mat ters occupying the first portions. Naturally the message treats primarily of the assas sination of Mr. McKinley, and this leads directly to a discussion of anarchy and the best methods of governmental cure. In logical sequence comes a discussion of the prosperous condition of the country in em phasis of the declaration that the anar chists have no ground for operating here. Then follows a discussion of the trusts. with the recommendation that Congress enact laws giving the federal government supervision over all corporations doing an interstate business. The President next recommends the organization of a new cabinet office, to conserve the interests of the commerce and industries of the country. and in this connection urges the immediate re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion law to prevent the influx of cheap labor from the far east. After a few words on the state of American labor, in which the Pres ident reveals his sympathy with intell ent organization, he urges a remodeling o the immigration laws to further protect the home worker and to elevate the standard of citizenship. Reciprocity i Urged. Passing to the consideration of the tariff the President declares that reciprocity is essential to the furthering of the American export trade. He says that "reciprocity is the handmaiden of protection" and specifli cally calls the attention of the Senate to the treaties laid before it by President Mc Kinley. He next recommends some meas ure for the rehabilitation of the American merchant marine as a further essential in the substantial growth of the export trade. He bespeaks the maintenance of the gold standard and suggests that changes be made in the currency and banking laws. still further to guard against the deranging influences of crises and panics. He warns against too radical a reduction of the rev enues and urges economy In expenditures. The interstate commerce act should be amended, he says, to give the commission wore power to insure justice to both ship pers and railways. One of the most striking features of the message is. the President's urgent recom mendation that steps be taken at once to ward 'the further preservation of the for ests of the country and that the govern ment undertake the establishment of irri gation systems on a large scale to open up the arid lands of the west to settlement. He speaks encouragingly of affairs in the insular possessions, and as to Cuba de elares that "we are bound by every consid eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her material wellbeing. As to the Philippines he holds that our. work there is being well done, toward the end of giving the Fili pinos not only good government in the present, but toward educating them in the ways of future self-government. The Pres ident recommends that laws be passed for the development of the resources of the islands through the grant of franchises. An Isthmian Canal. Mr. Roosevelt declares in positive terms in favor of the immediate construction of the isthmian canal, and points to the newly negotiated Hay-Pauncefote treaty as open ing the way to this consummation of the long-deferred American plans. He urges the construction of a Pacific cable. He re iterates the Monroe doctrine as the govern ing principle in all American dealings with the European powers in western affairs, and proceeds to urge the upbuilding of the navy as one of the surest steps toward the preservation of the peace. He bespeaks the construction of additional battle ships and the maintenance afloat of large squadrons comprising all'classes of vessels to give the personnel of the navy the fullest possible drill In the actual handling of war engines. On the same line are his remarks concern ing the army, for which he asks facilities for frequent drills on a large scale to per fect the discipline and to prevent dry-rot in the variops departments. He- asks for a closer co-operation between the army and the militia. The concluding points-of the message are of less consequence, hut all are treated in the same spirit of urgent recommendation. The President suggests that henceforth the Indian be regarded as an individual rather than as a member of a tribe. He naturally expresses his desire to' extend the merit system in the government service in all practicable directions and expresses the hope of a change in the laws regarding the consular service to insure the employment of the ablest public servants for this In creasingly Important work, A word of praise for the St. Louis, Ch Ieston and Buffalo expositions, for the Smithoian Institution and for the Library of Congress is followed by a recommenda tion that a permanent census bureau be established. The President points to the success of the rural free delivery and in this connection asks for additional laws to correct the second-class mall matter abuses. uituation in China. In conclusion the Preandent reviews the situation in China and declares for the con tinuance of our policy of demanding equal treatment in China with all other nations to ensure our natural trade .dvantages in that field. A reference to the Pan-A eian conference and a reference to certain claims affecting the relations of. this government and Megico is followed by a statement as to foreign expressions of sympathy for the national loss, apropos of the death of Queen Victoria and the German bmpress dowager, which affords opporunity for an expression of the President's intention that "our policy shall be such -as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual re spect and good will," Cosmaents en the Demt The expressIons as to the message ae generally commendatory. Scome follow: Representative RItt of Illinois, chainnan of foreign affairs Committee, said: "It in-the message of a statesmn." It contains more than mere words. It ,breathes an original forde, beth striking and delightful. A gart to which I particualarly raeer is to sanes trusts and oomblntlas. It is full of sana Repreentatise.MW of especially pleased with his attitude toward the trusts and with his recommendation for the exclusion of Chinese coolie labor from this country. All the way through, how ever, the message Is in every way com mendable." Representative Butler of Pennsylvania: "It is very strong and exceedingly Amer ican. I like his stand on the Chinese ex clusion question and for increased restric tion of immigration. These features es pecially attracted my attention. but I think that the message as a whole was a strong document." Representative Allen of Maine: "The mes sage will please New England first rate. His position on the tariff and reciprocity will be entirely satisfactory to our people. I also think that his remarks on Immigra tion and Chinese exclusion represent the feeling of the people of this country." Resteieting immigraties. Representative Loudenslager of New Jer sey: "Two features of the message at tracted my attention most particularly. I liked what he said about restricting Immi gration. That is an important question, and he is right. His method of dealing with the trusts, I think, will be approved on all sides." Representative Cooper of Wisconsin: "His ideas were more cogently and forcibly put than any message I have ever read. It is a great state paper." Representative Bartholdt of Missouri: "I think it is one of the greatest documents I have ever read. It is different from the usual presidential message in its philos ophy. I was pleased with the tender re gard he manifests for the interests of the wage-earner and the small dealer." Representative Sulser (dem.) of New York: "It is one of the strongest state papers ever presented, and is character istic of its author." Representative Landis, Indiana: "The message reads like the utterances of a vig orous American In the prime of manhood and in thorough touch with the spirit of the times." Representative Tayler of Ohio said: "It is strong, lucid and sound; full of courage, as of course It would be. and, for a mes sage, remarkably interesting." Mr. Newlands of Nevada said: "I regard it as a very strong message, covering all vital questions of the day interestingly and fearlessly." Representative Hill of Connecticut said: "So far as I have read I am very greatly pleased. and particularly with his treat ment. of the tariff and Philippine ques tions." An Able Doueement. General Grosvenor of Ohio said: "The message is a very able and well-written document. Some of its paragraphs remind one of the plain, easy and interesting lap guage of Andrew Jackson. Its rhetoric is of a very high order. On the whole the message will commend itself to tne ap proval of the people. "The fearless discussion of the trust ques tion is superb, and will call the attention of the people to the absurdity of the cur rent clap-trap upon this subject "The President's eulogy of his predeces sor is beautiful, and has not been excelled by any one of the host of speakers and writers who have occupied this field. "What he says of anarchy is what is more crudely in all minds. "Without going more into detail, I am delighted with the whole message. It is not necessary to say that I agree with the President in gross and detail in all he says." Lofty Aaercamism. -Representative FomF chairman of the House committee on naval gair, ad: "It pitched the keynote of high and lofty Americanism. I wa .prcutlarly pleased with his recommendations with regard to the navy. He has advocated no cessation in building it u', and has placed himself strongly on record in favor of several ad ditional. battle ships and cruisers to be authorized at this session of Congress. His recommendations in this respect seem to indicate that he is strongly in favor of a fighting navy and not a navy merely for dress parade. In this respect I am heartily in sympathy with him. I was also pleased at what he said in regard to strengthening the personnel of the pavy. With the in crease of ships must also come an increase in the number and efficiency of the men who man them." Representative Meyer of Louisiana: "It is a vigorous document I am. especially pleased with that portion referring to the navy." 'Spirited and Conservative Meesage. . Senator McComas of Maryland, when asked to give his views in regard to the message, to the reading of which in the Senate today he was an attentive listener, said: "The message is exceedingly well writ ten. It is a spirited document, and much of the catalogue of transactions with for eign states was omitted. Indeed, the only references of this nature are to the treaty with Great Britain in relation to the isth mian canal, and a reference to our good work in China, which could scarcely be omitted. "The statement of the life and death of President McKinley and the lessons drawn from the assassination will meet the ap proval of all our people. The specific recom mendations are conservative and necessary measures to repress this hideous cult of crime. The reference to the tariff and reci procity will be much read. "The President's statement of the reci procity we desire and the limitations un der our tariff system, is a precise state ment of what I understand President Mc Kinley's views to have been, and I be lieve it is the opinion of the republican majority of Congress. I hope we will heed the President's admonition, that with a large surplus we avoid reckless expenditure. "The treatment of railways, interstate commerce and trust legislation is conserva tive. I think Congress would desire to do, if it feels convinced it has the power to do, which is here recommended, "The President would now probably add another recommendation relating to the Philippines suggested by the decision of the Supreme Court of yesterday. "I think that never has our policy for the upbuilding of the navy and the betterment of our small army been so well stated as in this message. I believe that Congress-both sides ill eneral aprove the Presd dent's recoilimendations, and that the busi ness interests of the country will receive them with satisfaction, and that mny of these recommendations will be adopted at this busy session." .

Many of the senators, particular ly the close personal and political friends of the Bresident, already were familiar with the principal features of the message, but the reading of the first important state pa per of the President was marked by unu sual interest. Despite the cold and penetrating rain which fell throughout the morning the gal leries of the Senate were well filled with in terested spectators, many of them having a special interest in the message. When the journal of yesterday's proceed Ings had been read a communication was received from the House informing the Sen ate that that body had been organised and was ready to proceed with public business. Senators Hale and Morgan reported that they had waited upon the President in con junction with a like committee of the House to inform him that Congress was prepared to receive any communication he might have to make. The President h4 said he would communicate with Conreed at once in writing. Major 0. L. Pruden, assistant secretary to the President was then recognised and presented the message of the President. the reading of which was begun at once by Henry M. Rose, chief clerk. Close attention was given to the readi of the message by all senators. Printe copies of the document were distributet among them, the majority of whom fol lowed the reading from their copies. The reading of the message consumed two hours and fifteen minutes. and when it h" been completed Mr. Foraker was recog nized to offer the following resolution, foe' which he asked immediate consideration: "That a committee of eleven senators be appointed on the part of the Senate to join such committee as shall be appointed 4t the part of the House. to consider and re port by what token of respect and affee tion it may be proper for the Congress of the United States to express the deep sen sibility of the nation to the tragic deat of the late Presidct William McKinley, and that so much of the message of the President as relates to that deplorable event be referred to such committee." The resolution was adopted and then s a further mark of respect to the memory of the late PresMent, the Senate.. on. mo tion of Mr. #eraker. at 2:21 adjourned. HOuSE e1 REPUEgEWTT&WUg. There was a very good attendance In the galleries of the House of Representatives today to listen to the reding of the first message of President Roosevelt. The mem bers gathered early, chatting and diseses ing prospective legislation. The main topio was the personality of the new President. Keen interest was manifested in what be would have to say in his mesNge. An the hands of the clock pointed to 12 Speaker Henderson called the House to order. After the journal had been read and approved Mr. Cooper (Tex.) and Mr. Wood (Cal.), who were not present yesterday, ap peared at the bar and were sworn in. On motion of Mr. Payne. the floor leader of the majority, it was agreed that when the House adjourn today it be to meet Fri day. The Speaker announced the appointment of the committee on rules as follows: MA Henderson (Iowa), Mr. Dalzell (Pa.). Mr. Grosvenor (Ohio), 'Mr. Richardson (Tesn and Mr. Ur.derwood (Ala.). The only change in the committee was the substitution of Mr. UnderWoo* for Mr. Baley (Texas), who is now a member e the Senate Mr. Bingham .(Pa.). at the head of the committee appointed to wait upon the Pres ident, reported that"the committee, accom Danied by a like committee of the Senate, had performed its duty. and that the PreS ident had received their message with pleasure and had said he would at once communicate with the two houses in writ ing. Two minutes later Major Pruden. as aistant secretary to the President, appeared at the main entrance and announced a mes sage from the President. The message was taken to the Speaker's desk, where Speaker Henderson broke the seal. "A mnessage from the President of the United States," he said, as he handed th document to the reading clerk and dlet him to read i. Ordinarily peieta messages at the opening of a Congress a listened to in perfunctory fashion, but to day throughout the reading the keenest interest was manifested. Hardly a member left his seat until the reading was con cluded. There was a slight murmur of applause when, in concluding the recommendation for legislation to put down anarchy, tae clerk read, "No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of Congress." The mnurmurs when this sentence was reed was followed, by a burst of applause when the clerk peed: "The American peo ple are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is one kindled it burns like a coun muming flame." Probably no other pottio of the message attracted so muach atten tion, as that relating to trusts. No demonstration was evoked by the reading of this portion of the message, bet the recommnendstionl for the re-enasemmt of the Chinese exclusion law drew appase from beth sides of the House. The eaing of the maessage was conclud ed in the House at 2:5, Mr. Grosvenor then offered the following resolution, which was adopted without division. "Resolved, That a committee of one mess ber tromn each state repeseme n t e House be empaeolts on the pest of the House to jol.no acoammisee ss may be appointed on the pert of the Senate, to ea sidr and report by whet etaen of rme end affection it may be proper for the - grass of the United States to empress the deep sensibility of the nation to the deatha of the late President William ley, and that so much of the message of the President as relates to that de.Me event be referred to such cesmiste."
