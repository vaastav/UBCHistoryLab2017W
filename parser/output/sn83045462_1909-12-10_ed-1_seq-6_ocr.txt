THE STAB has a regular and perma nant Pamlly Circulation much mora than the comblnad circulation of the other Washington dallies. As a Vows and Advertising Medium It has no competitor. ?7In order to avoid delays on account ef personal absence letters to THS STAR should not be addressed to *ny Individual connected with the office, but ?Imply to THS STAB, or to the editorial or Business Department, according to tenor or purpose. Next November. The record of the present session will enter largely Into the contests for con trol of the next House. What will the record be? Tn considering existing divisions in the two parties and current calculations based upon them, we may safely discount all talk of the tall variety from what ever source it comes. The republicans are not already beaten. It is not a question merely of counting the votes. There could be nothing more absurd than the claim that the democrats will elect the next Speaker by a majority of a hundred. Those who make it are either enthusiasts, whose views have no value, or managing politicians making a preliminary play for the attention of the groundings. Equally worthless, too, is the asser tion that the democrats cannot win; that they could not be lifted in with a derrick; that the country is still in such a state of disgust with and dis trust of that party, success for it is Impossible. It is held in some quarters that the republicans could not, if they would, throw the next House away. There is going to be a fight. But the warmth and nature of the struggle we must all wait to see. It cannot be waged upon one issue. The country is not so much engaged upon any subject as that all others are thrown into the shade. For more than a dozen years the repub licans have won. They elected a House in 1894 on the tariff issue, the democrats having made ducks and drakes of their campaign promises by enacting the Gor man-Wilson law. They elected a Presi dent and a House in 1896 on the silver issue, taking as they did the gold side, and again utilizing protection as a policy. They elected a President and a House in 1900 partly on the money Issue and the tariff, and partly on that ridiculous issue of anti-imperialism, raised by Mr. Bryan in the face of his own record in the Spanish war matter. And they elected a President and a House both in 1901 and last year on the competency they had shown in office in dealing with public! affairs generally. Is the country prepared, or preparing.I to reverse itself on any of these ques- j tlons. Has the Payne law turned it; against protection? Has discussion of; currency reform taken on anywhere a silver tinge? Is there the slightest rea son to believe that we shall soon vote to give up the Philippines, Hawaii and Porto Rico? If these questions are an swered in the negative?and why not?? the importance of the record Congress is now to make becomes apparent In all j forecasts about next year. There is much unrest of a general nature. Can j the republicans allay it? Or will the democrats be able to keep it alive and capitalize It at the polls? Pure Milk for the District. Secretary Wilson's Intention to insure j pure milk for every man, woman and child in the District of Columbia, as ex pressed in an Interview printed in The Star yesterday, is an assurance that as j far as the laws permit the menace of milk infection will be fought by the fed- ' eral authorities, co-operating with those of the District. But with the best inten- ; tions In the world this work cannot be carripd to completion in the present state j of the laws. There is no federal statute providing tor the testing of cows for tuberculosis outside of the immediate ju risdiction of the national government, even though their milk is shipped in in terstate trade. The Secretary urges the enactment of a bill now pending author izing the federal government to test any cow in the 1'nited states, with particular application to Virginia. As far as the people ot' the state itself are concerned it is now within the province of the United States to institute protective measures. But here in this District are nearly 3u0,000 people, dependent for their milk supply almost exclusively upon the dairy herds in Maryland and Virginia. Between them and the transmission of disease through the milk stands on'y an agreement voluntarily entered into by some of the dairymen of the adjacent states to submit their herds to the tuber culin test. The health officer of the Dis trict may prohibit the importation of the milk if he can by some means convince himself of Its dangerous character, but the fact of the importation does not. as it should, give him or the Department of Agriculture the right to go into the state of origin and inspect the milk supply at the source by applying the recognized tests to the herds themselves. If the pending measure is enacted this fault will be corrected and the dangerous de ficiency supplied. The retirement of Admiral Togo from the Japanese navy Impresses Russia merely as a |^|M incident. There would b# awe tangible prospects of personal encounters if pugilists were is temperamental a# poets. Benjamin F. Shively. The democrats of the Ser.ate have solved the question of their leadership with a look ahead. In Mr. Money they have a competent man. familiar with the questions now before the coun try, and in line with his pp.rty on all of them so far as a line may be drawn on an organization somew.-.at disor ganized. He was for silver when silver was the issue, is for a tariff for revenue only, and opposed to trusts, of course. He knows his field of operations, and Is a ready debater. The selection is a j good one. The look aiiead was taken In the selec tion of Mr. Shiveley for vice chairman, which insures his advancement to first place when Mr. Money retires. As the senator from Mississippi closes his pub lic service March 4. 1911, this will bring Mr Shively forward on the eve of the next presidential election. He is a new senator, but not a new man to political life. Twenty-odd years ago he was a member of the House, and after retiring from that fi?ld continued his prominence and activity at home. He has been a candidate for governor, been mentioned for \ ice President, and was an easy victor in a strong field last winter for senator, lie should measure up withoutj difficulty, therefore, to this new poet In the Senate. If there Is opportunity in this selection for Mr. Shlvely, encouragement is like wise held out to all democrats north of Mason and Dixon's line. There, for years, the party has been weak, and constantly growing weaker. The repub licans have been sweeping things. Dem ocratic senators had been disappearing from the scene until not one from that quarter remained when Mr. Shively pre sented himself to take the oath. Democratic control in national affairs cannot be regained without the material growth of that party In the middle states and in the east. The south, except on the border, is solid, and will remain so. Mr. Taft's charming good nature, while greatly appreciated by that section, will have no more effect politically than did the charming good nature and overtures of Mr. McKlnley, or the picturesque per sonality. half southern, of Mr. Roosevelt. But. solid as the south Is. the south must have assistance. Alone, she is pow erless. Unless Indiana and New York, as formerly, and a few other states across the line, co-operate with her, she will continue, as for years, to be a mere looker-on in the national field. And says the south now In this compliment to Mr. Shlvely?for the south paid the compli ment?"Tou democrats, east, and west, and in the middle states, look alive. I want your help, and want to help you." As for Gov. Harmon, and Gov. Mar shall. and Judge Gaynor, all more or less in the national limelight, they would do well to keep an eye on Benjamin F. Shlvely of Indiana. If Mr. Shlvely leads the minority in the Senate well, he may leaJ the party?If Mr. Bryan falls?In the next national contest. The Jail Conditions. In his urgent recommendation to Con gress that a sufficient appropriation be made to effect the thorough remodeling of the District jail without delay. Presi dent Taft speaks with full au thority not only In behalf of the District of Columbia. but for the United States. The Jail here is designed for the imprisonment of those who have been found guilty of offenses against the federal laws. It is not a local Institution. Its inmates are the prisoners of ?...e Unit ed States, convicted in federal courts and pardonable only by the President. The spectacle offered at the Jail ist in deed, as the President says, "a reproach to the national government." The build ing is In truth "destitute of the ordinary decent appliances to cleanliness and sanitary conditions." Many years ago it was outgrown. Even If enlarged it would not, in Its present arrangement, be suit able for the proper treatment of prisoners. It is a mere packing box for condemned humanity, inhumane in its lack of pro visions for the moral and physical well being of Its occupants. Provisions have been made already for the establishment of a reformatory and workhouse on land near the District, an enterprise seriously delayed and urgently needed In the interest of the proper en forcement of the laws and the protection of the community. The prison commis sion. consisting of Justice Stafford, Mr. Edson and Mr. La Dow, upon whose recommendation this action was taken, headed its report with the proposal that there should be .in the District "a Jail, to be used only as a house of detention, never as a place of confinement for those under sentence." The President's recom mendation should be read in the light of ; this proposal, which Is based upon a thorough examination of the prisons of the country and a careful study of peno logical conditions. The prison commission suggested that the present Jail, with certain changes in the interior, would adequately serve as the proposed house of detention. All the recommendations of this commission were based upon a strict separation of offenders into four classes, those deserv ing of prison punishment, to be confined In a federal prison or penitentiary; those whose offenses are of a minor character, but who are In need of correction and not worthy of reformatory treatment; those who must be confined, but who can be, with reasonable hope of Improvement, giver the benefit of reformatory treat ment, and finally those who, In the Judg ment of the court or of the Institution j officials, can be liberated on probation or on parole. The President's recommendation for jail improvements should cause ttie comple tion of the work started last year with the grant of an appropriation for a re formatory and workhouse establishment. Two items remain?the correction of the intolerable jail conditions and the enactment of a probation and parole law. j Surely, In the light of the widely known I conditions that exist at the Jail, Congress will not longer hesitate to put this mat ter in the way of final enactment. | Judge Gaynor says he wants to find honest and experienced men to serve as officials in New York. The Diogenes of Manhattan has a harder job than the classic original. The New York man whose wife com plains in divorce proceedings that he made her drink ginger ale instead of champagne may have been trying to follow J. J. Hill's advice to eoonomize. The New York scientist who says that wiener wurst Is dangerous to health has no1 respect for the feelings of the real epicures of the American metropolis. A Boston publication suggests a club for poets. Really, this Is carrying an old joke a little too far. The case of Dr. Cook Is complicated by people strangely ambitious to figure as ! first assistant fabricators. Bouquets have been getting steadily scarcer for Dr. Cook since his admirers presented him with a garland of roses. Judge Parker Again. Judge Parker for governor, as the can didate of the so-called democratic league r?f New York? The nomination would at least be appropriate. He helped form the league, knows and represents its pur poses. and would poll Its full strength. He would have to secure votes from other sources to be elected, and in that fact would lie his difficulty. In 11?04 one of Judge Parker's claims to consideration at St. Louis was the fact that when a candidate for the bench some years before he had carried New i York by a large majority. Another claim was that, before that race, he had as a lieutenant of David B. Hill demonstrated ! rapacity for practical politics. And still ! another claim was that he had remained | on close terms with Mr. Hill, and that j his nomination would bring the latter with all of his friends actively into the campaign Alas! Judge Parker as a vote-getter had lost his power in New York. As a practical politician he had lost his cun i ning. He permitted his campaign to be ! managed, at least in name, by a ward j politician from Indianapolis. His inti macy with David B. Hill counted for nothing. New York gave Theodore Roosevelt an enormous vote. Judge Par ker's defeat was overwhelming. Then, as we ull know. Judge Parker moved to Greuter New York and estab lished himself In the practice of law. His eminence in the profession brought him clients of the capitalist classes. It was supposed he had left the political field forever. - One question raised by t ils rumor is, would Mr. Hearst support Judge Parker for governor? He supported him only languidly for President, and shed no tears in printer'** ink when the election re turns came In. He has not cottoned to him since. He looked askance at the Saratoga meeting where the democratic league was born, as a movement of the trusts through the agency of promi nent lawyers in their pay. He may have been surprised, as many others were, at the tone of the platform adopted, which was somewhat Bryanesque, but it did not bring him around to an accept ance of the league as a bona fide effort to revive true democracy In the state of New York. Mr. Hearst's favor is now sought. It is conceded in democratic circles that he has a following which is essential to the party's success. As he was able to poll a hundred and fifty thousand votes in a democratic city, end with their aid help defeat a democratic ticket all but the head, what might he not do in a state race in which he was disaffected toward the democratic ticket? Will Mr. Hearst O. K. Judge Parker? And if not, will the democratic league make the nomination in defiance of him? After all, John Early should consider himself lucky that the medical disagree ment in his case did not result in a need leas removal of his vermiform appendix. Senator Aldrich was favorably impressed with the west. Now the question is whether the west can see its way to re ciprocal sentiment. A New York poet is attracting notice because his creditors are suing him. Evi dently he docs not write musical comedy poetry. Mr. Calhoun is displaying noteworthy success in holding on to his prospects as minister to China. American sense of fair play will not permit the holiday canrlv trade to suffer because of sugar trust revelations. i. resignation rumor is one of the least of Zelaya's troubles. 

SHOOTING STAES. BY PHILANDER JOHNSON. Trying to Make Life Unpleasant. "No," said Mr. Sirius Barker. "I don't like those neighbors of mine." "Then why do you buy their children drums and tin whistles and accordions for Christmas?" "Because I don't like them." A Yearning for Home. "Were you ever homesick?" asked the statesman who has been abroad. "Frequently," replied the blunt col league. "I feel that way every time you pass out one of those long speeches.'' Not a Model Family. "Your father doesn't think you have been especially well behaved," said the small boy's uncle. "I know that," answered the precocious juvenile. "But things I have heard mother say make me think he isn't any great judge of high-class deportment." A Man's Terror. "Where are you going, my pretty inald?" "I'm going a shopping, sir," she said? "Won't you come with me?" He shook his head, And then, base coward, he turned and fled: The Brutal Friend. "What do you think of my latest novel?" "You should have made it your earliest instead of your latest," said the brutal friend. "As a first effort there might have been some excuse for it." Winter Song. Sing a song of winter Air so crisp and clear! Sunshine in the distance And joy bells ringing near: Snowflakes lightly failing To warm the buds asleep. Then a thaw and next a tramp Through mud that's two feet deep! Sing a song of winter When the frost is white And the tonsilltis germ Seeks you day and night! When the wind Is sighing Sadly through the trees; "Your furnace isn't working. And the water pipes will freeze!" Sing a song or winter Sing it aiijway; You've gut to ha\e your troubles. There are debts that life must pay. So set 'em to a Jingle As you laugh at fate perverse. Sing a song of winter And be glad it isn't worse! Foot Ball in Safe Hands. From tlir York Times. What passed between President Hadley of Yule, President Lowell of Harvard and Mr. Walter Camp, the "father of Ameri can foot ball," at their conference at Cambridge the other day will probably never be divulged. But the meeting was an acknowledgment by the two uni versity presidents that they would feel a certain responsibility for fatalities if pro duced by muss plays in future games of foot ball between their institutions. They may have told Mr. Camp that the cham pionship game at Cambridge this fall was not cleanly played; that there wap "slug ging" in the close formations, and un warrantable roughness that might have resulted in a broken neck or a fractured skull They may have remarked that they had been warned beforehand that, if the game should have this fatal out come, public opinion would not hold them blameless. They may have reminded Mr. Cami-. also, of his own published obser vations to the effect that the game, at its present stage of development, could not afford to lose through accidents men whose skill and long training were es sential to the execution of "winning plays." And they may have declared peremptorily that it was now a question of effecting a thorough reform In foot ball or of abolishing it. The White House. From the Boston Transcript. It is still the "White House" from which President Taft sends his annual message, instead of the "Executive Mansion." by which it had been formally designated before Roosevelt's day. But even that stilted title lacks the support of long usftge. Tne early Presidents de scr bed it as the "President's House," or the "President's Mansion.'' according to personal tastes. In Hip earliest plotting of Washington the Capitol and the White House wfre designated by names which would hardly l>e understood by the news boys of that city today. It called one "Congress House" and the other the "President's House." The White House Is the commonsense designation, because specific and in accord with popular usage. f Peers Lose. From iUc Toronto Mar. One thing seems pretty sure about the present struggle in England, and that is thai the peers lose whether they win or lose. 4 !??iiiinim?i?im?imiiiuiiiiiimiin??
