Ohairmau Payne of the- committee began a cross fire" of questions by asking .AJr. Schwab about a letter which had been referred to by a previous witness. This letter was written by Mr. Schwab to Henry C. Frick on May 16, 189?, and stated that rails were being made for less than $12 a ton, or nearly $7 less thap the cost in England. Jn the letter Mr. Schwab predicted that the Carnegie Steel com pany, of which, he was then president, •would be able to increase its net. earn ings to ?S,60().000 a month and said it could sell all of its surplus produc tion abroad at a profit nearly equal to the profit on domestic sales. Before proceeding with 'his testi mony Mr. Schwab, upon being ques tioned, said that the Bethlehem Steel company, of which he is president, is not affiliated with the United States Steel corporation, but he said that he was a stockholder in the latter cor poration. The steel magnate said that the letter in regard to which he was being questioned had been pre pared at Mr. prick's solicitation and was, written in an optimistic vein. Mr. Schwab gave a detailed state ment of the cost of making pig iron and steel rails, which indicated that the present cost,of manufacturing pig iron, is $14 a ton, as compared with $3 an ton in 1899 while the cost of steel rails today is $21.50 a ton, as com pared with $12 a ton nine years ago.

DUTCH CAPTURE ANOTHER BOAT Second Venezuelan Guard Vessel Taken.

Willemstad, Curacao, Dec. 1G.—The Dutch battleship Jacob Van Keein skerk has arrived in the harbor tow ing as a prize the Venezuelan coast guard vessel "23 de Mayo." Word of the capture had already been received here and a great throng of people lined the quays to witness the en trance of the Dutch' battleship con-, ducting her capture within the har bor. The flag of The Netherlands had been hoisted to the peak of the cap tured Venezuelan coast guard ship and astern of the Dutch flag floated the Venezuelan colors. Although1 the Venezuelan flag was still shown it was in minor contrast to the Dutch pennant flying from main mast and foremast both of the warship and its prize. The capture of -the "2?. de Mayo" was effected at a point a little north of Cumana, on the Gulf of Caraico. The battleship Jacob Van Ileemskerk observed the "23 de Mayo'" in the off ing, took possession of her and sent a prize prow aboard. The Venezuelan crew which had been in charge of the "23 de Mayo'' was sent ashore in the small boats of the captured ship. The Jacob Van Heemskerk then proceeded back to this .port, escorting her prize. The Dutch cruiser Gelde rland' has left hero for the Venezuelan coast. She had on board a seaman thor oughly acquainted with the small bays and inlets along the Venezuelan shores. She is out after tl\e Venezu elan torpedo boat Margarita, a steel vessel of ninety-seven tons and armed with four three-pounders and two tor pedo tubes. This vessel is supposed to he at the island of Margarita. The "23 de Mayo," while classed as a coast guard vessel, is a unit of the Venezuelan navy, but her size and strength are insignificant. She is of 130 tons and is armed with one ma chine gun. CALLS ON GERMAN OFFICIALS President Castro of Venezuela in Berlin.
