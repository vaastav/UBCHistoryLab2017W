TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAR 1TSI1 WHERE CAtiAL Die GOES Congress Asks for an Iterrt r ized Expense Account. HEPBURN SAYS MEMBERS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND DETAILS House Spends Four Hours Talking Ofi Big Emergency Appropriation : BillTo Be Acted on Today. Washington, Dec. tt With &n op portunity for ultimate debate on the subject of the Panama canal, the house exhausted Its oratory on that subject In h session of four and three quarter hours today. The bill appro priating 116,500,000 for canal work, which was the' subject for discussion, will be read for umendment and plae ' ed oil its final passage tomorrow. The featuro of the debate was the criti cism Indulged in by both republicans and democrats regarding- the incom pleteness of the statement of expendi tures and estimates furnished by the canal commission. Mr. Hepburn, in charge of the bill, mude some effort to ihow that while detailed estimates might be made satisfactory, at the same time members of the house were not in position to pass critical Judg ment on estimates on such work pre pared by expert engineers who held responsible positions ánd had been selected entirely because of their fit ness. I Bourke Cochran, of New York, took decided exception to this attitude on tihe part of Mr. Hepburnapplied It as affecting1 all matters of appropriation, and arraigned it as decidedly the wrong attitude of legislators. To en force his argument he read the senti ment of the president in his message for economy and scrutiny of appro priations. - The so-called press agent of the ca nal commission was criticised by sev eral speaker, and lack of .definite In formation as to the existence of such a position was shown. The place va,s declared to draw a salary of $10.000 a year, and some curiosity was nuuiir tested to 'know what were its duties.
