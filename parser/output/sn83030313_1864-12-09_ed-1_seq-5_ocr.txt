Mr. Adams replied that It has never been the desire of the government to treat with unnccesstry or vlndlo HTt severity any of the uugelded individual parties In thia deplorable rebelllou who bave fallen Into its bands in the -regular courso of the war, and that he Should greatly rejoice If the effects of such sympathy could be extended to ministering to their mental ailment ?s well as their bodily suffering, thus contributing to put an end to a struggle which otherwise Is too likely to be only procrastinated by thoir English sympathizers.

Mr. Urookk said <bat In the opinion or a large number of maiiuficturors it was quite Impossible, under ibe prin ciple of tbe law, ever to have honeat manufacturing of Rigr.rs. Tbe temptation was so great, tbe duly f-o im mense, and the punishment so sevore as to reudnr It aim'.st imposslbirt to prevent fraud by the measure tow be'ore thena. There was no d >ubt, from the best infor mation, tbat tnn beat way was to attach a one cent stamp to each cigar sold, and this would produoa a larger reve nue than the principle In tbe bi;i. Mr. Stb r.vs explained tbat all ibe committee had done was to put a i rojer construction ou the law In ocntrsdio tloo to n very erroneous deoislon ot tba Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. IUwbs. (rep.) or Masa , said that some or tbe ma no acturers had stopped nearly entirely in consequence of this very singn'ar construction of the law. Tbe con atructl 'n went even beyond tbe law liseir. He thought si'ini'thing m're tbsn a simple joint resolution was neces sary to remedy tbe defects. He hoped bis friend front Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) would be patient In clearing up tbe * amoke" whlob surrounds tba aub:ect. Mr Stbvbim than proceeded to abow tbat nine tenths af the cigara manufactured sine* Congress adjourned bad paia but tbree dollars tnatead of eight dollars a thou aand, owing to tbe construction of tbe Commtaaiaoer of Isternai Revenue. The measure pending waa, be re peated to gtre tbe proper eonstructlon to tbe law. Mr. Bacon expreaaed tbe hope that tb? oimml'tea would take time to ooanll with basset tnaaufacturers In order to remove tbe existing dlillcu'tias, bat as tho Secretary of tbe Treasury bad recommended a duly oo leaf tobacco, a duty on tobaoco should be considered in tbe same connection. Be repeated that experienced men bad advised a(atamp on cigara atrailar to tba poetage stamp, aay or.e oent, and as yielding tbe largest reve nue. Tbe temptation to amuggllng from Canada and elsewhere waa now Irresistible. Old stamped cigar boxes were used la which tb put new cigara, and ao a atasap alone witild stop lb la, beaidea resizing tbe Urgaat revenue. Mr. Lkohard Mrnt", (rep.) of Pa., trotted that tha rub Ject would be acted upon at once. owing to the present construction tbe income of the government waa mucb re duced I rum tbat source.

Tba history of the caae, aa detailed by Uie plaintiff, ap pears to be substantially aa follows:? In the month ef May, 1863, the child Adolph waa taken sick. Dr. Soother waa sent fer, and preeoribed for tba patient, who waa afflicted with scarlet fever. Several dnvn elapse "I. when the father called upon tba doctor, and asked bfm why he had not called to soa the patisnt. Tho doctor Inquired If the child had finished alt tba medi cine; and, ou receiving an anawor In tba affirmative, bs ?laud that tba boy waa all right. The father, believing tho child w^s convalescent, took him out In tho open air. which brought on a relapse. Dr. Bnether waa sent for, and. upon examining tbe patient, declared that he waa suturing with uropay or the cheat. A week olapsed, and tbe physician announced that 11 wonld be neoeeeary to bavo ao operation performed. The father, hoping to B*ve tbo life of the child, consented that the operation Should b? i?rrormed, but tbe physician seemed unwill'n* to proceed With the work. The plaintiff then atked tho doctor if he would not Ilka to have tbe assistance of another physician, and suggested that Dr. Child* Rhoull be called iu. Dr. tnctbrr appearing to favor Ilia propo alllou, Dr CblVls waa called In. and the two physMaos met Iii consultation It was decided that sn operation should be ,erfnroi?'d the f.illowirg day; but four riave slap* ad, and no physloiin apiwared. The plaintiff then wont to I". Aether, and Inquired why ha had not railed upon tbe patient, when the physician said lie did not Intend to ooioe any moro. The father eakoJ why; wb'n tbe defendant said It waa because Dr. Chi Ida had heon called In. The plaintiff then Inquired why ha did not object to Pr. Child's be ing called at first t when Knether reiiltad, "Ob, it Is na matter n"W; do what you like; ! Intend to eali no more " Upon oalllng upon Dr. Chllde in relation to the matter tba latter expressed bU astonishment at the course pursued by If. Fnethar; but still declloed to visit the patient on account ot the do'endant heinu tbe family phvaiclan. Tba piaioilir then applied to a number of other physicians for relief, but th?y all refused to Interfere In Hie caae when they tvard that the defendant waa the family physician. Finally the services of a doctor were procured. but too latetoaave the Ilia af the patient, who died Jut one in -nth after it waa taken a>ok. On the croes examination, however, tbe plaintiff ad mitted that be bad a quarrel with Dr. Snetber relMlve to the bill, which, in the opinion of ooensel for the4efeooe, wee the Impelling cause In urging the present suit.
