It IH tlio Intention of the ( lepartinent to develop the mil * Ilia of the coast BtutoH to a lilli ( ; do- jsroo of prollclency In the handling of big guns In the fortH. Acting Secre tary Oliver , thin week transmitted to tlio governors of the several states Interested n copy of the memorandum prepared by ( Joneral Murray , chlof of artillery , and suggesting that It Is of tlio greatest Importance that they do- nlgnato as soon as possible the com panies that are to act as coast artill ery. reserves and Its supports. Illinois Is to send a solid Cannon delegation to the national convention , according to Congressman Charles 12. Fuller of the Eleventh Illinois district. Mr. Fuller declares the delegation will Btand by "Uncle Joe" to the last and will not be organized for purposes of trading , nor will It enter Into any deals looking to the support of any other candidate. The Illinois representative Is enthusiastic over the Cannon chances , and became almost hectic In his praise of the speaker's ability and l > orBonalIty. Ho wound up with tlio statement that "It's Cannon first , last and all the time ; ho is going to win nnd that's all there Is to It. " However , " ' " friends all "Undo Joe's" arc doing the talking. The czar of the house Is emoklng his usual number of black cigars a day and does not appear to too worrying over the posslbllo out come of his political fortunes. THE NEW STATION. While some of us still feel that Nor folk should have had a union passen ger station , with all the passenger trains that enter the city centering there , and that an opportunity was lost"to the city that will never be pre sented again , yet It must bo admitted that the Northwestern has erected a handsome up-towu passenger depot which Is a credit to Norfolk. The out side appearance of the now station is rather deceptive , In that It does not glvo an idea , of the real elegance of the Interior. The new station Is a good one , perhaps better than at any other town except Fremont , Omaha and Lincoln in the state , and wo ought to bo satisfied and would bo If It were not for the shadow of that handsome union station which came BO near being a realization last spring , but failed unnecessarily. When Senator Fulton of Oregon reached Washington ho at once pro- jecded to administer a brisk kick in the shins to the campaign of his col league , Senator Bourne , who is workIng - Ing overtime in an effort to prepare a. Roosevelt stampede in the Repub lican national convention. Senator Ful ton declared that the people of Oregon are taking Mr. Roosevelt at his word when he says he will not run again and that they are In favor of Secre tary Taft for the nomination. He be lieves that the secretary of war will got the solid Oregon delegation , de spite Senator Dourne's "second elec live term" campaign. Senator Kill ton Is in favor of legislation In the coming session that will provide amore moro elastic currency. Ho attributes tlio recent financial flurry to stock gambling , and to curb this ho would have placed a heavy tax on contracts made on margins. In fact , be Is con elderlng the introduction of a bll bringing this about. Sitting around In Washington hotels and boarding houses are twenty-five extremely nervous young men. Thej ere candidates for appointment to the consular service , examinations for which were held last week. The pap crs of the twenty-five have not ye been marked and are still In the hands of the examining board ; hence the nervousness. The reforms In the con Biilar service are working wonders li Introducing to foreign countries a much higher grade of commercla agents nnd diplomats. Instead of be ing rewarded for political services by berths abroad , men now are chosei for their educational qualification and business ability. The fact Urn the George Washington university 1 maintaining as part of Its organlzatloi a college of the political sciences h which such men are trained , gives the government an excellent and access Iblc recruiting field. In the last con sular examinations , which were held In Juno , two of the successful candidate for positions abroad were graduate of this school. The navy department Is working at greater pressure than at any Urn since the Spanish-American war. Th preparations being made for the Jour ney of the battleship squadron around the Horn to Pacific waters Is occupj Ing the attention of every ono In the department , from Secretary Metcal down. The enormous quantity o ) OdBtuffH necesary for the trip is eeplng buny scores of clerks and iiurtormnslora , while the higher olll- era linvo been compelled to exert a lorMonnl supervision over the pur- hano of those mippllua. Every safe- unrd Is being taken to prevent the oHnlblllty of the slightest breath of caudal being stirred In connection vllh the contracts. Some Idea of hat Is being done may bo gathered mm the fact that 1,000,000 pounds of refill meat nnd 1,000,000 barrels of our have been bought as part of the oed Btipplles. There are 1(5,000 ( men nd 800 olllcers to feed and the amount f provender necessary for this big rmy Is enormous. ( JETTING MONEY HACK. The west IB getting back its money rom New York. Now York may have thought that t could retain the currency of the nation within Its palm , but the west s gottlng vnluo received and Indl- ectly , If not directly , gottlng back Its prosperity. The west Is buying mill and factory products from the cast. The cast Is ho factory center nnd from the cast como most of the finished products in ill lines of merchandise. Dut Instead of sending cash to the cast with which o pay for these commodities , the west Is sending Now York drafts orders on New York banks. In this way the funds of the west , on hand in Now York arc being used , n this way the cast , by sending out commodities In return for the funds already on deposit there , Is letting Blip rom Its lingers the surplus of the west which It had hoped to retain. And the longer the thing continues , .he . moro will the west get back , in .ho . form of commodities , the money that It has sent cast. Poor Secretary Taft ! While parties of merry Russian revolutionists are dotting to blow up the secretary of A-ar and his party during their journey oward St. Petersburg , Senator For- aker at homo finally has touched off a mine that may yet topple the cab net officer's political boom. Senator Moniker's announcement to the coun- .ry that he Is a candidate for the rop- ibllcan nomination for President whllo lot altogether a surprise , scarcely ivas expected at this time. It probably never would have been made had It lot been for"Secretary Taft's absence. The hour was ripe for such action , and although the Foraker boom may suffer from premature launching , the end the senior senator from Ohio had n view will have been materially ad vanced. Only the most sanguine and optimistic of Senator Foraker's friends bellovo that ho has any chance of get ting the nomination. It Is well known that his chief ambition Is to demor alize the Taft forces , splitting the state delegation and making It prac tically impossible for President Roosevelt velt to unload the secretary of war on the country as his successor. From now on the fight In Ohio will be watch ed with much interest , and there Is no doubt that it will be a bitter one. 

NORFOLK A STOCK MARKET. Norfolk has rapidly become a stock sale town within the past year , and II Is already established so strongly as such a market that there is no longer question as to what it means in the future. The time was not so long ago that such a thing as a public sale of horses or cattle was not known In Norfolk , but now It is quite different The removal to the city of the Sniltl Bros. Land and Live Stock company with bi-monthly sales during the sea son , has probably done more than anj other one factor to establish In the minds of outside people the fact that Norfolk Is the place to como to bu > or sell live stock. The location of the city has much to do with making this a stock market , as it does with many other Interests that center hero. I Is moro easily accessible than any other town In the northern part of the state , easy to reach by rail , has abundant hotel facilities to take care of strangers nnd has every advantage to offer persons who contemplate sell ing horses or cattle at public auction. And best of all , no sale of this character actor has been held hero that has done well , because the people of this sect Ion are all becoming so well-to-do tha they are fully able and glad to 1m prove the condition of their herds b > the addition of other good stock. CHEEKS ARE RUDDY. The past week In a retail way was not a bad ono and Saturday was a pretty good day In all lines. There Is abundance of money in northern Neb raska and southern South Dakota and the farmers are so well supplied will the world's goods that they can cithe hold or sell their products Just as they choose. Many of the commission houses nro advising thorn to hold. Now York reports that the retal business throughout the country is Improving and a tremendous holiday business Is expected in this Immediate region. The people have money and farm products , there is every basl abroad for prosperity and there 1 every reason to expect that the Christ mas stocking of the now northwcs will be filled to overflowing. Whllo the prices on live stock and grain have gone off a certain extent , the farmers are still getting rattling good allies nnd can still make money. And the reductions that have occur * d will roHiilt In general reduction all around on prices that had got almost beyond the limit. All In all , northern Nebraska and outlicrn South Dakota well Intrenched Kill tut all the wor'd ' , Is In a mighty > nilthy condition. Its checks are iglow and KB circulation Is good. Its apart beats on tlmo and Its lungs are omul. What's more , the people know vhat they want , are supplying their vants and there Is going to be a moil- < tor holiday business , compared with nany pnrtB of the country. QUICK SERVICE. The president's message , a volum- nous document containing 30,000 vords , was delivered to congress In Washington at noon on Tuesday , nnd bnforo 2 o'clock It was bring read by mtrons of The News In Stanton , Bat- lo Creek , Madison , Pierce. Hosklns and other near by towns , while It was u'lng road In Long Pine nnd Dallas at the same tlmo that Omaha readers ) f Omaha dallies wcro scanning Its mportant utterances. Moreover , The Vows was able to glvo the full text of the message , while most of the dallies of the state only gave abridged re ports of six or eight columns. The News carried every line and every word of the complete message nnd gave It to its readers long before any ) thcr paper could possibly reach them. Thus on the Dallas line of the North western , the message was seen In The Mows twenty-four hours before the Omaha papers bringing the same 'news" can get to them. The message was presented to con- jress at 12 o'clock Washington time , and by 12 o'clock Norfolk time the nil text of the document was being printed on the press of The News nnd every train which leaves this city be tween 12 and 2 o'clock was carrying bundles of papers to readers all over this great northwest. This once moro .lemonstrates the claim that if people of north Nebraska and southern South Dakota want the news while It Is yet now , The News Is the paper to bo de pended upon. 

NORWAY POPLAR. The forest service of the government which has been becoming more and moro anxious over the fast disappear ing timber of the United States during the past few years , has discovered some good qualities in the Norway pop lar , and has Issued a circular concern ing this discovery as follows : "Tree planters throughout the northern portion of the middle west have had brought to their attention lately the extraordinary value of the Norway poplar , a near relative of the common cottonwood , which possesses fine qualities that bid fair to raise the prestige of the whole cottouwood fam ily. "This cottouwood is shrouded In mystery , so far as Its origin Is con cerned. It bears no cotton and is re produced entirely from cuttings. The tree grows straight and lean and it is said that the bark never scalds or cracks. The wood Is straight-grained and suitable for lumber. It splits easily , seasons quickly , and makes ex cellent fuel. "Tho Norway poplar grows very rapidly. In Minnesota it has been known to grow 50 feet high with a dla meter of 17 inches In 11 years. It makes a good shade tree , retaining Its leaves until late In the autumn , and on account of its rapid growth should prove very desirable for windbreaks and sheltorbelts. So far as Is known at present , this tree is perfectly hardy and will grow under a variety of sol and moisture conditions. It seems however , to respond quickly by in creased growth to cultivation and care "Tho advantage which the Norwaj poplar holds over the Carolina poplar ono of the most popular of cottonwoods Is chiefly in its greater hardiness , bet ter form , and the seemingly superior quality of Its wood Is shown ii preliminary studies made by the United States forest service. It wll be some time before the Norway pop lar will bo available for wide-spread planting , since cuttings of the true variety nro at present very scarce and hard to obtain. " It Is altogether appropriate that Jus at the tlmo of the record-breaking con vention of the National Rivers & Har bors congress , the Department o Commerce and Labor should have Is sued Its report on Lake commerce during October. The report offers con vinclng proof of the growth of water way navigation under favorable con dltlons and is a strong argument for the development of such rivers nnd barbers bors as would contribute to the general oral prosperity of the nation. The re port shows that traffic movements on the lakes during the month of Oct ober aggregated 11,820.003 net tons which was 28 per cent In excess o the quantity shipped during October 190C. In this enormous total were contained 12,212,249 bushels of wheat 0,093,002 bushels of corn , 5,106,099 bushels of barley and 18.1C9.9C2 bush els of oats. The waterways con vcntlon balled those figures with de light. They prove conclusively tha the country , In the face of railway congestion , is returning to water trans portatlon for relief and finding it VJth n complete system of Improved Ivors , coupled where necessary by anals , the transportation problem of ho United States would bo solved. John Sharp Williams had no oppo- Itlon whatever In his candidacy for 0-eloetlon as loader of the minority mrty In the house. At the last mo- nont Congrosman DcArmond of Mis- ourl. who had been widely spoken of is a dangerous candidate for the post- ion , announced his determination note o enter tinr c < > . It la understood mofllclally that this withdrawal , coup- od with the knowledge that this was Mr. Williams last term In the house , vas partly the result of a political leal. Mr. Williams' public announce- nent that he will bupport Bryan for ho presidential nomination also had niich to do with the withdrawal of other candidates. 

EXCHANGE DAY. The first Norfolk "exchange day" ias passed Into history , nnd It Is ro- : ordcd that Its success fully equalled .ho fondest hopes of those who bad .ho matter In charge. The farmer says t Is Just what Is wanted , and the bus- ness man pronounces It good. Pro- mbly no move was ever made in the : lty that had quite the beneficial effect of uniting farmer and business man .hat this Exchange day project has resulted in. Through the meeting at a common point made possible by the dea , the town man was brought Into jontact with his country friend , and the man from one part of the country again met his friend from a distant iiortion , so that the event carried with it a social phase as well as one of imslness. And that spirit of fratern ity Is an Item that should never bo lost sight of , for what community Is more irosperous and happy than the ono iVhere the spirit of friendship exists , ono man with another , a spirit that can In no manner thrive so well as ivhere neighbor comes In frequent con tact with his neighbor. The Exchange day Idea was not a Ity man's project any more than It was a farmer's plan. It Is true that he suggestion was made in town but it was not developed until entcrprls- ng farmers of the neighborhood took : iold of the scheme and pushed it to completion. Norfolk business men had been talking of such a market day for a year or more , but they were un able to do more than talk until the farmers joined hands with them , and : uen It required but a short time tel l > ring about a full realization of the project. Credit for the success of the plan , therefore , should be equally divided between Sturgeon's trade promoters and Ernest Raasch's com mittee of live farmers. The offering of articles to trade or sell made at the first day far exceed ed expectations , and that the pur chasers were not so numerous as was hoped Is perhaps due to the fact that no one really expected there would bo so many offerings at this Initial meet ing. There should be no spirit of disappointment , then , that every article offered was not sold. Another time prospective buyers will bo more numerous and will come better pre pared to take advantage of the bar gains. Norfolk made the occasion a gala day , Hags and bunting were freely dis played , the parade and the music of the bands gave the city a holiday appearance , and the town folk were mighty glad to see the country folk. The auspicious beginning at the In itial Exchange day has settled the permanency of a market day in Nor folk , and hereafter it will be a regu lar feature on the first Tuesday of each month. THE MESSAGE. Probably no presidential document of recent years has borne the same relation of importance to the people as the annual message of President Roosevelt given to congress on Tues day. It Is a strong document , written with all the logic of the president's best style , maintains his position against dishonesty and fraud and urg es congress to put Into legislation the principles of fair play between the powerful few nnd the struggling many. The message Is what might have been expected from Roosevelt strong , In cisive , plain spoken , radical but not revolutionary. The president argues that the most vital need of the country today Is a more active government control of the railroads and the method of doing this would bo either a national in corporation act or a law licensing railroad companies to engage in In terstate commerce upon certain con ditions. The law should bo BO framed as to give to the Interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securities while means should be provided to enable the commission , whenever in Its judgment It Is necessary-to make a physical examination of any rail road. The president maintains that no moro stringent laws are needed to bring about this result , but greater activity upon the part of officers of the law is needed , and until the gov ernment assumes proper control of Interstate commerce In the exercise of the authority It already possesses It will bo Impossible cither to glvo or to get from the railroads full justice , The president Issues a warning to the nnr umy nun uutiii lur BBYurui | corporations when ho says : "The railroads and all other great corpora tions will do well to recognize that this Control must come , " Congress la urged to glvo Immediate attention to the currency , recommend ing a law that will provide greater elasticity to the medium of exchange , provided that a recognition of the even greater need of safe and secure money bo maintained. Ho Bhows that at certain seasons of the years when crops are moving that the country must have more money than Is avail- ible under ordinary conditions nt the present time. Provision should bo made for an emergency currency , with an effective guaranty based on ado- Itiato securities approved by the gov ernment , and Issued under a heavy tax that will force Its retirement ns soon as the especial demand ceases. Other recommendations of the pres ident arc : Revision of the tariff nfter the next presidential election , upon the basis of the difference In the cost of labor here and abroad. An Income nnd an inheritance tax , to discourage the formation of dan gerous fortunes nnd to lighten the burden of taxation upon the man of moderate means. Limited but definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the federal power. The eight-hour law for all govern ment employes. Government Investigation of rail road accidents , In the Interest of hu man life. Federal inspection of grain. Improvement of Inland waterways , especially the Mississippi river. Amendments of the public land laws to permit the fencing of range owned by the government and to give better protection to the homestead right. Protection for forests. Removal of the tariff on wood pulp. Establishment of postal savings banks and extension of the parcels post , especially on rural routes. Congressional appropriations of cam paign expenses. Increase of pay for the army and severe examinations for officers. Construction of four battleships. Appropriation for the Japanese ex position. 

FEDERAL QUESTION AGAIN. Another test of whether the govern ment of the United States is greater than that of the states Is likely to como up in the coming session of con gress over the proposed federal in spection of wheat at terminal points. A bill has already been completed by Senator McCumber of North Dakota providing for federal supervision of grain under the authority and Jurisdic tion of the department of agriculture. The North Dakota senator has had this matter before congress for the past four years. But he has never been able to make substantial progress , ow ing to the determined opposition of senators from the northwest. During the fifty-eighth congress Sen ator McCumber made a vigorous at tack on the state inspection of grain In Minnesota , and in the fifty-ninth congress ho repeated and amplified his statements. Senators Nelson and Clapp took Issue with the North Da kota federalist , and after a heated de bate the matter was allowed to rest. But Senator McCumber persisted until he secured the adoption of a resolu tion by the senate , Instructing the interstate commerce commission to prosecute an Inquiry Into the relations , ownership and operation of the ele vators in buying , selling and shipping of grain , and what connection , if any , such elevators had with owners or lessees of railroads. In accordance with that resolution , an Inquiry was taken In the northwest In October of last year and continued for a month , and as a result of that Investigation by the Interstate com merce commission , n voluminous re port has been filed with congress , showing all the testimony taken at the hearing , and much has been said , and , In fact , proof has been adduced to show that many elevators In the north west have not only received special favors from railroads , but In some cases they have actually been operated or controlled by the common carriers. Senator McCumber claims to have the assurance of President Roosevelt that he will recommend federal Inspec tion of grain in his annual message to congress. The McCumber bill Is a long one , containing fourteen or fifteen sections , and enters into a detailed method whereby the secretary of agriculture shall organize In his department a bu reau of grain Inspection to supervise nnd report upon Interstate trade and commerce In grains , their grading weighing , Inspection , etc. The chief inspector is given a wide latitude In appointing deputies. The salaries are to be paid from the fees collected from the Inspection of grain , The deputies are to bo under the civil service and must pass an examination In order to fcderallze the Inspection of wheat , etc. , It Is provided that all grains shipped from any state Into an other must bo Inspected and passed upon by a federal officer Provision Is made for grading and classification. That there will bo opposition to the McCumber bill Is clearly apparent from ho concurrent resolution of the Mill lesota state legislature nt Ita last session. In that resolution , which was ipprovod March C , 1D07 , the atato log- slatuio takes Isstio with tlio North Dakota Icglslatutc , which passed res- ) lutlons containing chargoa itgnlnat the Minnesota grain Inspection. Poplos of ills and Minnesota's concurrent roso- ution were sent to the senators and representatives in congrosB from the northwest and attached to the olllclal locuinont was an exhibit showing how srnln In the northwest Is handled un- tier state Inspection. When Senator Nelson was governor 10 recommended nnd took active part in state grain Inspection , Several measures were under consideration nnd the legislature , which passed the 1)111 ) being composed largely of farmers , Senator Nelson called them In and had several conferences with them. Many of their vlewa wore embodied In the Itlll before It was passed. If President Roosevelt recommends federal grain Inspection It will glvo the measure a gread deal of prestige , but nt the same time he cannot count on the support , of many of these states which do not believe the federal gov ernment should bo given any power that will in any way curtail the Influ ence of the local politician. Senator La Folletto may advocate federal Inspection. Even If a bill pass ed by the senate Its chances of over gottlng through the house are said to lie very remote. 

CORN IS KING. W. W. Jermane , Washington correspondent pendent of the Minneapolis Journal , lias been investigating the cause and effect of the recent financial Hurry , and lie concludes that the American farm er Is more than seven billion dollars above and beyond being to blame for the tight money situation which has been bothering everybody else. Whllo the business of the United States has been chocked because the banks of New York have held a billion dollars of the country's money tied up In marginal speculative securities , and have declined to release the money until they could do so without loss , the secretary of agriculture has boon pre paring figures to show that during the past year the farmers of the United States have brought Into the country moro than a billion dollars of foreign money. While the parasitical speculator has been paying usurious rates for money and has produced nothing , the farmer has done nothing but produce. In the first place the farmer has during the past year raised $7,412,000,000 worth of farm produce. A largo share of this has been sold , a billion dollars' worth of It abroad , and the money placed In the banks all over the coun try. Then these banks , attracted by the Interest rates in New York , have since so faded in value that if collec tion wcro forced a good many people who are not used to It would have to go to work for a living. The figures about the farmers cited are from Secretary Wilson's annual report. The report has other state ments revealing with equal eloquence the desirability of the farmer as a citi zen , but offering no arguments in favor of the desirability of the stock gamb ler. Thus it is shown that eight such corn crops as that raised In the Unit ed States this year and sold at the price this one Is bringing , would build every foot of steam railroad In the country , Including all the expensive terminals , and pay for every particle of property of whatever name or na ture owned by these roads , but nothing Is cited to prove that the original pro ductiveness of a stock market would or could build a railroad In a million years. The total value of all that the farms of the United States produced In 1907 Is 10 per cent more than the value for the total production of 190C , although the crops this year have not been quite as good as last year. The total value for 1907 is also 17 per cent more than in 1905 , 20 per cent above that of 1901. 25 per cent in excess of that of 1903 and 57 per cent greater than the total vaulo for 1899. The total farm ex ports for the year have been $1,055- 000,000 , or-$79,000,000 above the high est previous record. Corn Is king , accorlng to the sec retary. It Is the chief crop of the United States , whether measured In money value or In variety of services performed. The value of the 1907 crop Is 2G per cent greater than the average for the past five years. The next best crop , from a financial point of view , is hay , although It may bo that the final estimates will give second end place to cotton , which Is coming strong. Cotton raised In 1907 Is valued at $075,000,000 and It Is the mosts val uable crop ever produced In the coun try. The wheat crop for the year Is valued at $500,000,000 , which Is 5' per cent more than the average for the last five years. Other crops have also done well In the way of making the more speculator look like the unnecessary dead beat on the national band wagon , which ho Is. Thus the alfalfa crop amounted to $100.000,000. Sugar , molasses and syrup brought In almost as much more , oats , $300,000.000 ; potatoes , $190,000- 000 ; barley , $115,000,000 ; tobacco , $07,000,000 $ , but this would have been at least $100,000,000 if the tobacco * i ( - trust wore in ( ho bottom of the st-a ; llaxBeod , $20.000,000 ; rye , $2.1.000.000 , ilco , $10.000,001) ) ; buckwheat , $10.000. 000 ; hops , $5,000,000 ; dairy products , $800,000.000 $ ; poultry and eggs , $000.- 000.000 ; animals , llvo and slaughtered , f 1.270.000,000. , But there Is one sad note and only ono In the Bocrolnry'H report. Whllo ho says the farmer will have moro lo spend and moro to Invest than ho ever before had out of ono years' work , he acknowledged that his llguros and estimates were made Just before these chaps In Now York , who toll not nnd neither do they until , served their Joke upon the country. If there proves something wrong , therefore , with the report's prediction regarding the amount of money the fanners will ieal tzo out of the year's business It must not bo attributed to the secretary , nor to the farmers , nor to anyone but these solf-snmo Now Yorkers , who , now that their game Is temporarily suspended , are seeking to fasten tlio responsibility for whatever has happened or may happen upon the president of tlio Unit ed States.
