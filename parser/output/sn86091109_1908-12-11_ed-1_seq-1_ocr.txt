Spokane, Wash., Dec. 11.—The Lewis.on-Clarkaton display In the , gre at national apple show Is highly creditable and ranks with the best of the district displays in the ex hibit. Messrs. McCarroll, Ferguson und others who collected and arrang ed the exhibit are deserving of much ciedit. The display brings forth much favorable comment. There are o great many window exhibits on Riverside and Sprague that have not been at the show yet. The I.ewiston ■Gano apples In Carr's window are the best looking and largest shown.

The tops of the boxes •re removed, and they are placed side by side on a stand which slopes about 50 degrees, and they present a solid front of polished red apples 108 feet long by 10 feet high. They are so perfectly graded that when you stand at one end and look across the surface It looks like a series of rows of apples extending across the entire 108 feet. They are packed to extend about the top of the boxes, *o that the boxes are not noticeable when looking at them In this man ner. This Is one of the features of the show. Wenatchee and Yakima apples each have carload exhibits. There •re 28 exhibits, each occupying a space 15x18 feet, with 10-foot back fall.

RELATIVES HAVE FIRST RIGHT ^ m COURT OF IDAHO. I An interesting point of law ln- j volving the appointment of an ad arisen, has been decided by the su- \ pieme court and which has reversed the decision of District Judge E. C. ! Steele and the piobate judge of La- ' tah coun.y. ; lhe action in question Involves the G. VV. Daggett estate in Latah county, appraised to lie worth ap proximately $23,000. Mr. Dagget. died last bebruary and his wife had died about three years before. He was survived by a sister, Mrs. Jen nie S. Thompson, and several broth ers, among whom is John J. Dag gett of Nezperce. Shortly after the death of Mr. Daggett the sister, Mrs. Thomas, pe-! tilioned for letters of administration and asked that Fred T. Bressler. cashier of the Genesee State bank ; be named as administrator.' This pe- 1 Jtion was supported by the brother, ; John J. Daggett, was was opposed by a stepdaughter, Mrs. Mathews, who claimed the estate by leason or oral! promises, alleging the deceased had said he would make a will leaving all j of his property to her. Mrs. Mathews j petitioned for the appointment of Henry H. Bangs and the probate court held that inasmuch as several applications for the appointment of an administrator had been named At was discretionary whom he should appoint, and in exercising this pow er the court appointed Mr. Banga to administer the estate. The case was i appealed to the district court, where the probate court was sustained, but an appeal was then taken to the su preme court and the decision of the lewer courts has been reversed. It is held by attorneys that the supreme court of the state of Idaho has placed Itself in line wl.h the state by holding that the natural heirs are entitled to nominate and have the administrator of their choice In preference to and to the exclusion of the nominees of stran gers, creditors or claimants for the estate. LOWER RATE ON WOOD LEWISTON WILL SOON GET WOOD FROM MOUNTAIN OVER NEW RAILROAD—MAY MAKE FUR THER REDUCTIONS. Special to Evening Teller. Keubeus, Idaho, Dec. 11.—With a reduc.ion of 45 cents a cord for the transportation of wood from this i jsiation to Lewiston the movement of J the mountain wood will be commenc -1 ed within a short time. The rate is, still almost prohibitive and it is be- i lieved the railroad company will be , induced to make a further reduc-1 tion when the actual conditions are j made known to the traffic depart- j ment. During the time the new road was 1 operated by the construction depart- j ment a charge of $2.65 a cord from j Reubens to Lewiston was made and: with the inaugura:ion of the through servee and the passing of the road into the hands of the operating de- J partment, the wood rate was reduced to $2.20 per cord. The wood marketed from thp Reu- 1 bens station is cut from land that is valuable for agricultural purposes as soon as cleared and very little, waste land is found in this section. The land Is all owned by settlers who acquired the same by homestead and the removal of the timber will j mean the seeding of timothy and; the cultivation of grain crops. This improvement would provide an an-i nnal tonnage from the land where now timber stands and as the policy of the railroad company is to assisr ! the settlers in the improvement of ; their property to the greatest ton ffecapacity i* is generaiiv believed hotter rate for the mountain wood ill be provided.

An action is now under count ot preparation that will he of unuottl Interest to every taxpayer of Net Perce county, as the result of tht suit will determine the liability of the warrant and bonded indebted* neaa at the time of the annexation of the aectlon of Shoahone county The suit will be filed in the Inter* es* 8 of the taxpayers of that por tion of the county annexed from Shoshone county and the purpott will be to prevent a further colite* tion of taxes assessed for the pur* nose of paving the warrant and bended Indebtedness of Net Ptrtt eounty at the time the annexation . was perfected. The form of suit to he Instituted haa not been determine ed. hut action wilt he commenced within a short time, aa It Is hoped to secure a decision that will apply to this year's taxes. The case for the tsxpavers hat been nlaced In the h«nds of the le gal firm of 0-den. Morgan ft Mor* »•o, and for the past severs 1 week# ettornevs have h<*en gathering dato where decisions have been rendered on pointe of law similar to the condi tions existing In Net Perce county. At the time of the annexation of the south part of Shoahone county to Nes Perce county, the bonded indebt* edneee of Bhoajione county wnt ap proximately $888.000, and the war rant and bonded Indehtèdnew of Non Perce county approximately fits,* 000. Bv a decision of the supreme court, of Idaho the annexed portion of the county was held reeponslhl» for the pavment of Ita. proportion. of the Indebtedness of Shoshone coun ty and a special tax to meet thin obligation has been annually collect ed from the annexed portion. The annexed portion haa also been tat#A for lte portion of the Indebtedneaa of Nez Perce county at the time the annexation was perfected, and It It against this latter taxation that tha protest haa been made. While tho attorneys have declined to dlacuat the case, the taxpayers of the annex ed portion have stated action will ha tEken to recover the amount paid mi the old county tndeb'-dpeaa provid ing the suit to atop further payment lu successful. In the Idaho revised codea provi sions are made for the liability and collection of taxes for the payment of nn indebtedness Incurred by any county before being segregated. In section 1963 is as follows; "Thg faith, credit and all taxable proper ty within the limits of the county, ns constituted at the time of auch issue, are, and must continue, pledged to the payment of such bonds." The attorneys for the taxpayer« claim that a further Interpretation of this law would mean that aa far ns former obligations of the terri tory In question is concerned, ths boundaries remain unchanged and that while the segregated portion of the county is held for Ita portion of an indebtedness contracted in ihv other county, it cannot be taxed for nn indebtedness existing in tht county to which it is annexed, aa the original county is holding for all former obligations. In section 1964 of the Idaho revis ed codes are the provisions for tha special assessment and the collection ot the special taxes by the assessor. At the present time the taxpayer# of |he annexed portion con end they belnK doub)y taxed and th8 are court action will be taken for the purpose of securing equity to the an nexed section.
