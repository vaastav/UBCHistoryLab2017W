CONGRESSIONAL" IXXVIIth Congress First Session. Washington, December 1st. House. The Chiipltiin returned thanks for the brightening nrospeets for the lib erty of the slave, tor emancipation from a system which had involved us in sor row and shame. The roll was called by States. A quo rum was present. A message from the Senate announc ed that a quorum hud assembled, and it was ready for business. A similar message was sent to the Senate. A committee of both Houses was ap pointed to wait on the President, an nouncing that they were ready to receive any communication. Concklin, of New York, offered a reso lution, which was adopted, instructing the committee on naval affairs to inquire and report the brat mode of placing ves sels of war on Lake Ontario when an exigoney may arise, and establish water communication from other waters to the lakes, and report which of the various modes a most reliable. Vallandigham, of Ohio, offered the fol lowing resolution, which was adopted: Resolved, Thar the Committee on Ju diciary be instructed to inquire and re port to the House at an early day by what authority of the Constitution or laws, if any, the Postmaster General un dertaxes to decide what newspapers may and what newspapers may not be trans mitted thforch the mails. Cox, of Ohio, offered the following: Whereas many citizens of the United States have been seized by persons act ing or pretending to be acting under the authority of the I'niti'd States, and have been carried out of the jurisdiction of the States of their residence without any pub lic charge being preferred against them, and without any opportunity being al lowed them to learn or disprove the charge made or alleged to be made aga'nst them; Whereas, certain arrests have been made in the States where there is no in surrection or rebellion, or pretense there of, or any other obstruction to the author ity of the Government; and Whereas, It is the sacred right of ev ery citizen of the United States that he shall not be deprived of his liberty with out due jiroceBS of law, and when arres ted shall have a speedy and public trial by tin impartial jury: therefore lle$hed, That the House of Repre sentatives does hereby condemn all such arrests and practices as nnwarrcnted bj the Constitution and laws of the United States as a usurpation of power never given up by the people to their rulers, and do hereby demand that all such arrests shall hereafter cease, and that all per sons so arrested and yet in prison, snail have a prompt and public trial according to the provision of the Constitution and laws of the United States. On motion of Mr. Colfax the preamble and resolutions were laid on the table, SO against 40. Richardson, of 111., offered the follow ing: 1. Resolved. That the President be re quested to inform the House of Repre sentatives what citizens of Illinois are now confined in any forts or places of confinement, and upon what charges such citizens were arrested, and that the President also inform the House of Rep resentatives the names of persons arrest ed iu the State of Illinois and confined iu prisons outside the limits of said State, what the charges are aguiust them, by whom the charges are made and by whose orders all such arrests are made. From the Potomac Army. Special to tho Herald. Headquarters Army Totomac, ) Nov. 30th, 1862. Considerable excitement is occasioned by the circulation of a report here that a proposition has been made by the rebels for an armistice of thirty days, and that Lee was already in Washington arrang ing terms of the agreement. No cre dence is put iu this rumor, however. The rebels arc working with redoubled vigor on their fortifications, and their cavalry of late have been very active and have captured a number of our pickets along the fords of the river, besides the two companies of the 3d Pennsylvania cavalry at Harwood Church. Longstreet commands the right and Hill the left of the rebel forces confront ing us. Deserters coming within our lines rejort that a large body of their forces have been detached and sent off either to Richmond or to rf lnforee Stone wall Jackson. These reports must lie received with great caution. Our caval ry have captured a number of rebels on the river below this place. A Fight Kxpceted. New York, Nov. 29. The armv cor respondent of the Philadelphia 'Lnquirer from Acquia Creek, says, daily, hourly, iu fact momentarily, we expect to hear the first gun fired that will inaugurate the first grantl battle of this campaign, for it is in that vicinity that the entire rebel army almost is concentrated, 100, 000 strong. A dispatch to the Philadelphia Press says that last night Rurnside's army woultl soon move and that we are on the ave of one of the greatest battles of mod ern times. racial to the new yokk tost. Washington, Nov. 29. It is under stood that the annual report of the Sec- 1 retttry of the Treasury is completed and will be laid before Congress on Monday. The army and navy reports will not be ready for delivery on Monday. The re port of the Secretary of the Interior and the Post Master General are ready. The 1 President's message was read to the Cabinet yesterday, but will uot be closed till Sunday night The President will withhold his signature till the last mo tent in order to avail himself of any ad- i dtUonal information that may be received.

Highly Important from Richmond. Washington, Nov, 30. To-morrow the Philadelphia Inquirer will contain a Washington dispatch, professing to Jhave reliable information direct from Kieh mond. The substance of its information which is probably of average reliability, or more is as follows: '"The people of Richmond have been having another panic for the past two weeks. The removal of McClellan and the rapid movement of Hnrnside were the first causes. At the time of Burn side's movement, Longstreet was in Rich mond on his way to Nrth Carolina, the campaign in Virginia being supposed to be over for the winter. A part of his corps were with him. They were put in to the works around Richmond at once, while he took the cars for Fredericksburg to hold the Rappahannock line if possi ble; and if not. to retard our movements till Lee should come up. There are now twenty to twenty-five thousand in the works around Richmond, and but 80,000 north ofithtt place, including Lee's and Jackson's forces. Jackson has been recalled, with Hill and Stuart, from the Valley, to form the left flank of Lee's army. Jackson was opposed to coming, and wanted to keep up a division of our forces by raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania, but was overruled b' Lee and Davis. The Cabi net at Richmond have ordered Lee to throw his whole army on the Rappahan nock, and dispute every foot of ground thence to the rebel capital. They have plenty of raw provisions, and millions of pounds of beef, pork and flour are accu mulating at Richmond. Vessels with clothing are running the blockade every week, but their army is still suffering terribly. Numerous recent events serve to inflame the Richmond panic, such as Lee's suddenly changing from the offen sive to the defensive; his telegraphing daily for more men to save the Capital, piteous appeals of their army for clothes, (Jen. Dix's capture of their pickets on the Chickahoininv, the discoverv that they've lost G0,000" to 100,000 in the last UOdays in battle, by sickness and deser tion, and indications of slave insurrec tions during the holidays; Burnside and the Government are believed to have lull acquaintance with these facts. Rurnside regards his present force as ample for the work before him." Complaints against thr; administration of the (iuarteruiaster's Department grow louder. Rurnside is un.-leratood to have made the strongest representations on tliissubiect to the Administration during his recent visit here. It is ascertained on all hands that if Meigs had furnished the necessary articles at the proper time, there would have been no delay at Fal mouth. Meigs admits the failure, but charges it on the Engineer Corps. Ru mors are rife to-night that Meigs either is removed or is to be speedily, but they can hardly be well founded. TAX 

REVENUE. Stories current for some weeks, of a belief that two or three blind red mi 11 io US would be realized from the Internal Rev enue bill are characterized by Mr. Chase as gross exaggerations. Mr. Morrili, of Vermont, whose offi cial position makes his opinion also trustworthy, says the revenue from taxa tion up to July next is sure to be less than one hundred millions. CABINET MEETING BCRSSIDE PRESENT. An important cabinet meeting was held this afternoon, to consider, as is supposed, certain jenints in the forth coming message, and also matters be fore Fredericksburg. Gen. Rurnside's visit there to-day is supposed to have have had some connection with the Cabinet meeting. Rurnside has return ed to the army. THE FEDERAL OAVALRX TAKEN PRISONERS. The battalions of a regitneut of Illi nois cavalry, under Capts. Johnston and Hess, comprising detachments of Com panies F, C, G aud M, while out on a reconnoissance westward from Freder icksburg, yesterday, were surprised by an overpowering force of rebel cavalry, and, after a brisk little fight, were all taken prisoners. We lost one hundred men and five commissioned officers. Several were killed and wounded before our men surrendered. This regiment is the one which cut its way out of Har per's Ferry before the surrender of that place. EXPLOIT OF GEN. STAHL. Gen. Stahl attacked a superior force of rebel cavalry at Snicker s Ferry yes terday, and drove them within four miles of Winchester. Fifty rebels were killed, and forty taken prisoners. Union loss was but fifteen. A large amount of com missary stores, ordnance, eighty horse3, eighty head of cattle, three stand of col ors, and other rebel property were cap tured. BANKS' EXPED1TIO.V. There is great anxiety for the speedy movement of Ranks' expedition. Washington Items. Washington, Dec. 1. The attendance in Congress to-day was not very large, either of Senators, members or specta tors. No diplomats were present. It is well understood that the message fore shadows Chase's financial scheme, so far as it relates to a national banking sys tem. The Republican of to-day has an elab orate article, said to be inspired from official quarters, arguing against any further advance of Burnside, for fear that Washington might he attacked. Rebels Whipped In Arkansas. Springfield, Dec. 1. General Rlunt with five thousand federals attacked and routed about eight thousand rebels under General Marinakuke, at Cone Hill, Ark., ou the 20th, killingjtgixty, and driving the balance some twelve miles. General Rlunt telegraphs that the euemy is badly whipped and will not probably return north of Boston Mountains again this winter, and as they have consumed all subsistence in the valley of the Arkansas they must retreat into Texas. Arrival of the Hibernla. Cape Race, Nov. 29. The steamer Hibernia from Liverpool with dates to the 20th, and Londonderry 21s', passed this morning. Breadstuffs steady and quiet, Corn upward. Provisions dull. Consols 93 for money. It is reported thaa steamrr similar to the Alabama, has left Liverpool and an other will soon follow. A Brief Abstract. New York, Dec. 1. The President, in his Message, gives a summary from the Secretary of the Treasury's Report He refers also to the Reports of the Secreta , rics of the Navy aud of War, and says, ' though lengthy, they are only brief ab stracts. I He says there is a decided improve I meat in the financial condition of the ' Post Office Department compared with j the preceding years. The Secretary of 1 the fnterioa reports the public lands have j ceased to be a source of revenue. Spcak ! ing of Indian affairs and the recent trou i bles he says I submit to your especial ! consideration whether our Indian system ' shall not be remodeled. He suggests the earliest completion of the Pacific I Railroad and also the favorable action of Congress on the projects for enlarging the Great Canals of New York, Illinois, and Michigan. Cincinnati, Dec. 1. River fell two ' and a fourth feet in the last forty-eight hours. Weather cloudy, with some rain last night.
