Duffy aialt Whiskey Co., Rochester, N. Y. . .. ,# : Japanese Declare Naturalization Will Insure Peace With Asia Hailing President Roosevelt as a dis ciple of universal peace and a construc tive statesman, gifted with visualiza tion into future world problems, the Japanese Dally New World, voicing the sentiment of the Japanese of San Fran cisco, In an editorial this morning de clares that the recommendation made by him on the naturalization of Japan ese is the most rational solution for the eradication of racial prejudice yet made by an American. President Yukawa of the Japanese Society, echoing the same sentiment, declared last night that the message of Roosevelt was tantamount to a guaran tee of permanent peace between the United States and Asia. "Talk of the possibility of war be tween Japan and the United States can not be sustained in the face of this latest message from President Roose velt," he said. "It is regarded by Jap anese here as one of the most con- vincing manifestos of his Ptatesman- j ship and grip on world problems that, v.c has ever made. It will be hailed In : fc-'-.pan as a great document from th* 7*>n of a great statesman. The one thing needed to cement the bonds of friendship between Japan and the TTnited States will be the recognition of the wisdom of the recommendations made by the President In this message, ronfer the right of naturalization on Japanese, and you forever establish the name of the United States as a world power great enough to conceive a dec laration of independence for all men in fact. Naturalization of Japanese. In brief, will be one of the greatest steps yet taken by Theodore Roosevelt for universal peace. "He Is big enough to see through the ' inordinate vanity of men •who say that their brothers are not as good as they because they come out of Asia, a coun try which had its arts and civilizations centuries before the peoples of Europe had emerged from tribal communion er.d barbarism. "Why. ask yourself in fairness, are not the Japanese as fitted to assume all the duties and responsibilities of American citizenship as the Turks, Greeks, Roumanians and other Immi grants that pour into your doors from Europe with every steamer- that enters New York Bay? Why should you dis criminate against Japanese and confer the right of franchise on any or all of the great Slav tide, that grows with every year of increasing American ex ploitation in the lands over seas? Are Japanese comparable with Slavs? Are they as skilled workmen? Have they as good morals? Is their loyalty to any cause they pay allegiance to as unim peachable? I think all these questions can be answered with a positive af firmative. "There Is a noticeable disposition to criticise Japanese for their fealty to their own country — a characteristic which is used by their detractors to indicate that their citizenship in any country they may seek adoption is questionable. Time will dispose of this fallacy. It is useless to comment on Its unfairness. You might Just as well say that a German who fought In the Fran co-Prussian war could not become a good American citizen after coming here and being naturalized. I look in time for Japanese citizens of the United States who will be as loyal and devoted to the ascendancy of Americanism and American institutions as the natural ized aliens of any country of Europe. I think the recommendations of Presi dent Roosevelt forecast this time." Benjamin We Wheeler Thinks President Wise 

BERKELET, Dec s.— President Wheeler tonight gave out the follow ing statement on the Japanese situa tion: To have Influenced even in one mat ter so decided a character \u25a0as President Roosevelt would be an honor, but I certainly claim it this time. His mes sae*> was prepared and In tne hands of the press before I saw him. In large part however, at least for substance of doctrine, I agree with him. Cordial relations with Japan, both commercial ly and otherwise, are of prime impor tance to the Pacific Coaat. particularly to San Francisco. The school question Is really In itself a small matter, at least in volume, for only a small num ber of pupils is involved. Many, if not most, of these are adults, and adults should not be allowed in the lower echoolE. no matter of what race. If it had been only children who were in- volved I cannot think the question would have been raised. The real question that is disturbing us as a people concerns the rapid im migration of Japanese laborers, and this question we may surely know is safe in the hands of the President, who is at once the well proven friend of Japan and a thorough-going American in full sympathy with the needs and aspirations of the people of the Pacific Coast. The immigration of Japanese coolies will have to be restricted in the interest of conditions here, in the in terest of the good understanding be tween the two nations, and ultimately^ as we believe, Japan will seej.lt In the interest of Japan herself. But this is a delicate matter, requir ing delicate treatment.' Japan is a first-rate power, and whatever is done will have to be done with her consent and co-operation. It is best not to be disturbed about the President. He un derstands our situation, and \u25a0when the clouds roll by he will be found our best friend, too. mT^ 

BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER. Kennan Asks Why There Is Talk of a Conflict OAKLAND. Dec. 5. — George Kennan, the distinguished author and war cor respondent, who is studying the Japan ese question in" California, has decided views on the subject as far as it af fects the possibility of a clash at arms between the island empire and the United States. Kennan said: "I am here as a stu dent of the situation and I am not ready to express myself in this regard- But if the Pacific Coast, and Califor nia especially, desire to escape being overrun by Japanese the only proper course to pursue would be to request the Government at Washington to open negotiations with Japan looking to ward restrictions being placed b^ Japan herself upon the class and quan tity of emigrants leaving that country for these shores. That would be the wiser course, instead of putting up the bars against them on this side. . "Regarding the eventual probability of war arising between the two coun tries for the supremacy of the .Pacific, why should we fight for it? Because both America and England use the Atlantic Ocean . must they fight for su premacy? Is not the Pacific broad enough for both? The supremacy" of the Pacific on commercial lines will be won by the best brains and the best organization." \ . Capital Believes the Crisis Has Passed WASHINGTON. Dec 6.— A1l possibil ity of trouble between this country and Japan is at an end, according to the views of nearly every one concerned in the matter.

The diplomatic crisis has been passed. Th« case remains to be sifted through the California courts. Treaty Can Be Made That Will Avoid Disputes 

WASHINGTON. Dec. B.—Representa tive Jenkins of Wisconsin, chairman of the House committee on judiciary, made a statement today In regard, to the Japanese situation as follows: "Primarily it might be said the en tire school question is, under the abso lute control of the State by virtue of police power,, unless interfered with by the treaty-making power. Unques tionably a treaty can be made covering and including the question, but it Is not for me to say whether the treaty does or does not cover or Include it. That is for the administration to de termine until the courts decide. There is no sense or Justification in talking war. It is worse than silly." Says Adjustment Will v / Follow Legal Test WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.— -The Califor nia delegation in Congress has received what they consider a satisfactory as surance that the President did not desire to be understood as saying in the Jap anese section of . his message that he would use the military forces of the United '' States in forcing the. Japanese into the California schools in which the white children : are taught. TThis whole . San Francisco affair is proving to be a tempest In a teapot," Representative Julius Kahn' said today. "It will die out rapidly as soon as there is a general understanding of why' Cal- i fo rnia takes the position it does. , "The citizens and the public will'set tle all the legal questions involved in the San Francisco courts.
