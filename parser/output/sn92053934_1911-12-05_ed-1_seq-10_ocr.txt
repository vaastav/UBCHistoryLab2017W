10 THE ROCK ISLAND ARGUS. T' DECEJFBER 5, 1911. Taft, in Message, Champions Anti-Trust Act New Remedies Suggested Washington, Dec. 5. President .iTaft's third annual message to con- ress, devoted exclusively to the Sher- man anti-trust act and the trust quea , tlon in general, was read In congress v. today. The president said: VTo the Senate and Hoas of Repre- ' sentatlves: yr This mif Hage la the first of several r-r which 1 shall aend to congress during A the Interval between the opening of lu regular session and Its adjourn ment for the Christmas holidays. The Vamount of information to be commu- ulcsted as to the operations of the 1 .government, the number of Important .'subjects calling for comment by the U executive and the transmission tocon-i-greas of exhaustive reports of special .'commission make it Impossible to In ((clad in one message of a reasonable i length a discussion of the topics that r ought , to be brought to the attention of the national legislature at Its first ".regular session. - In May last the rapt-erne court band .H down decisions In the suits in equi J.ty brought by the United States to en join the further maintenance of the ."Standard OU trust and of the Ameri rca Tobacco trust and to secure their I dissolution. The decisions are epoch .making and serve to advise the busi .."ness world authoritatively of the fcscope and operation of the anti-trust ' act of 18S0. The derisions do not de 'pert In any substantial way from the previous derisions of the court In con f strains; and applying this important ."statute, but they clarify those decl i Galons by further deOnlnj, the already 1 admitted exceptions to the literal con struction of the act. Hy the decrees Vthey furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of Illegal trusts. irThe decisions sugrrest the need and Kwindom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality -tbus Dually established and to pre j serve the benefit, freedom and spur of .'reasonable competition without loss of fjrenl efficiency or progress.

(IIAMUK IX THE RILE. ' The statute In its first section de- ttclaros to be illegal "every contract, .-combination lo the form of trust or iotherwlse or conspiracy in restraint j of trade or commerce among the sev teral states or with foreign nations" ;and in the second declares guilty of a 'i misdemeanor "every person who shall y monopolize or attempt to monopolize .Tor combine or conspire with any other .person to monopolize any part of the t trade or commerce of the several states (or with foreign nations." r In two early cases, where' the statute was invoked to enjoin a transporta tion rate agreement letween inter- state railroad companies, it was held - "that it was no defense to show that . the agreement as to rates complained 'of was reasonable at common law. be en use it was said that the statute waa directed against all contracts and com , blnatlons in restraint of trade, whether '"reasonable at common law or not. It was plain from the record, however, -.that the contracts complained of in those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable at common law. In sub--eoquent cases the court aald that the statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused to include : within its inhibition certain contrac- tual restraints of trade which it de nominated as incidental or as indirect These cases of restrant of trade that the court excepted from the operation . of the statute were Instances which -at common law would have been call ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil -and tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the com i moo law and in defining exceptions to jthe literal application of the statute -only substituted for the test of being Incidental or Indirect that ot being .reasonable, and this without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have . been decided the same way if the 'court had originally accepted in lta .'construction the rule at common law. i' It has been said that the court by in troducing into the construction of the . statute common law distinctions has emasculated it This la obviously un true. By 1U Judgment every contract and combination in restraint of inter- tale trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling price by stifling competition or of establish ing in whole or in part a monopoly of ucb trade is condemned by the stat 'ute. The most extreme critics cannot Instance a case that ought to be con demned under the statute which la not - brought within lta terms as thus con strued. . The suggestion is also made that the r-rcpreme court by lta decision In the last two case has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade is within the term or the statute. This la wholly untrue, ;A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law la well understood and is rlnarly defined. It does not rest in the '.discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a j lawful main contract to which In order (that it shall be enforceable at all it must be Incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contract it Is void. The test of reasonableness was nevef ; applied by the court at commas law .to contracts or combinations or con spiracies lo restraint of trade whose rurpose waa or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to con- trol prices or establish monopolies. I Tte courts ' never assumed power t sny that such contracts or combina tions or conspiracies might be lawful If the parties to them were only mod erate in the use of the power thua se ured and did not exact from the pub '' fc too great and exorbitant prices. It ' Is true that many theorists and others 1 engaged in business violating the atat k" ute have hone chat some such line cr-' i t f twu by courts, bat no court r- s-.nl has ever attempted it Certainly there la nothing in the ded alons of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of Ju dicial discretion in enforcing this stat ute can derive the slightest sanction. FORCE A.ND EFFKCTITEXES8. We have been twenty-one years mak ing this statute effective for the pur poses for which it was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and eeemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev er, the error of that Judgment was cor rected, and only in the last three or four years has the heavy band of the law been laid upou the great Illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutious have been brought, and a number are pend ing, but Juriea have felt averse to con victing for Jail sentences aud judges have been most reluctant to Impose such sentences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes better un derstood and the committing of it pir NliM mure of studied and deliberate defiance of the law we can be conn- ! dent that Juries will convict Individu als and that Jail sentences will be im posed. In the Standard Oil case tlie supremr and circuit courts found the combina tion to be a monopoly of the interstate busiueas of refining, transporting and marketing petroleum and Its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different corporatlous. the stock of which was held by a New Jer sey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, di rected the transfer and pro rata distri bution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it in the thirty-sevea corjKnitlonH to and anion:: its stock holders, and the corporations and Indi vidual d"fcnd:ints were enjoined from conspiring or i-onilining to restore such monopoly, mid all agreement: tween the subsidiary cor;r:itlons tend ing to proluce or hrinj; aljut further violations of the net were enjoined. In the tobneco case the court found that the individual defendauts. twenty-nine In number, had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire com plete dominion over the manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco In this country and abroad and that this bad been done by comldimtions made with a purpose and effe t to stitle competi tion, coil trol prices and establish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but alw of tin foil and lic orice used In Its manufacture and oT its products of cigar, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for n decree which would effectuate the will of the court aud end the violation of the stat ute. There was here uu single hold ing company, ns In the case of the Standard Oil trust. The main company was the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling and holding company. The plan adopted to de stroy the combination and restore com petition Involved the redivislon of the capital and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies con stituting the trust and new companies organized for the purposes of the de cree and made parties to it and num bering, dot and old. fourteen. SITfATIOX AFTER READJUSTMENT. The American Tobacco company (old), readjusted capital $92,000,000; the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company, (new), capital $67,000,000: tbe P. Lorll lard company (new), capital $47,000, 000. and the It. J. Reynolds Tobacco company (old), capital $7,523,000. are chiefly engaged in the manufacture and sale of chewing and smoking to bacco and cigars. Tbe former one tin foil company is divided into two. one of $825,000 capital and the other of $400,000. The one snuff company !s divided into three companies, one with a capital of $15,000,000, another with a capital of $8,000,000 and a third with a capital of $9,000,000. The licorice companies are two, one with a capital of $3,758,300 and another with a capi tal of $2,000,000. There is also the British-American Tobacco company, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $20,000,000. the Porto Rlcan Tobacco company, with a capital of $1,800,000. and the corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of $9,000,000. Under this arrangement each of tbe different kinds of business will be dis tributed between two or more compa nies with a division of the prominent brands in the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible, but necessary. Thus the smoking tobacco business of the coun try is divided so that the present In dependent companies have 21.39 per cent, while the American Tobacco com pany will have 33.08 per cent, the Lig gett & Meyers 20.06 per cent, the Loril lard company 22.S2 per cent and the Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has been taken from tbe defendant American Tobacco company and bat been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given voting power which was denied It under tbe old organization. The ratio of the pre ferred stock to the common was as 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change In the character of the owner ship and control of each company. In the original suit there were twenty-nine defendants, who were charged with being the conspirators through whom the illegal combination acquired and exercised lta unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants win hold amounts of stock In the various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maximum to 28Vi per cent as a minimum, except In the case of one small company, the Porto Rica a Tobacco company, lo which they will hold 43 per cent. Tbe twenty -nine In dividual defendants ere enjoined for enree years from buying any stock ex cept from each other, and the group la thus prevented from extending its con trol during that period. All parties. to the salt and tbe new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpet ually from In any way effecting any combination between any of the com panies in violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust Each of the fourteen companies is en Joined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from h:iviug common direc tors or officers, or common baying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. 

SIZE OF NEW COMFAXIR8. Objection was made by certain In dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with , very large capital in active business and that the settle ment that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of the capital, and plant of tbe trust into small fractions in amount more near ly equal to that of each of the inde pendent " companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of the anti-trust law and its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital In busi ness enterprises in which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when its purpose Is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and establish ing a moBopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capita! and plant have been divided we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the statute. It Is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Vethods of punishment by fine or Imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of its goods in transportation are provided, but the proceeding in equity is a spe cific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by Injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital Inviolation of the statute. I venture to say that not in the his tory of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the tobacco trust. As Circ;:!t Jndw Koyes said in bis Judgment approving the decree: "The extent to which It has been necessary to tear apart this combina tion and force It Into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demon strate that the federal anti-trust statute is n drastic statute which accomplishes effective results, which so Ions as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed and which cannot be disobey ed without Incurring farreacJJng pen alties. And. on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this or ganization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not to de stroy, but to reconstruct: not to de molish, but to recreate In accordance with the conditions whieh the congress has declared shall exist among the neople of the United Spates. COMMON STOCK OWNERSHIP. It has been assumed tbat tbe pres ent pro rat:j and common ownership in all these companies by former stock holders of the trust would insure a continuance of the same old single con trol of all the companies into which the trust has by decree been disinte grated. This is erroneous and is based upon the assumed iuefflVacy and innoc uousness of judicial injunctions. The companies are enjoined from co-operation or combination: they have differ ent managers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching Into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market their number Is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed, and Its prime movers and all its partic ipants would be at once subject to con tempt proceedings and imprisonment of a summary character. The immedi ate result of tbe present situation will necessarily be activity by all the com panies under different managers, and then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Only a short time will Inevitably lead to s change In ownership of the stock, as all op portunity for continued co-operation most disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration In tbe trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to tbe Inevitable working of tbe decree and understand little tbe personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught tbe sol emn Injunction of a court whose object Is made plain by the decree and whose Inhibitions are set forth with a detail and, comprehensiveness unexampled in the history of equity Jurisprudence. The effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the combina tion of manufacturers of. electric lamps, a southern wholesale grocers' association, an interlocutory decree against tbe powder trust, with direc tions by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combinations of a similar history are now negotiating with tbe department of Justice looking to a disintegration by decree and re organization In accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations without general bust, ness disturbance. But now that the anti-trust act Is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment of the purpose of Its enactment we are met by a cry from many differ ent quarters for Its repeal. It la said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of destructive competi tion between small units and to make Impossible those useful combinations of capital and tbe reduction of the cost of production that are essential to con tinued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions the supreme court makes clear tbat there fa noth ing In the statute which condemns; combinations of capital or mere big ness of plant organized to secure econ omy In production and a redaction of its cost. It Is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of Immense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly that the statute is violated. Mere sice is no sin against the law. Tbe merging of two or more business plants necessari ly eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this elimina tion Is in contravention of the statute only when the combination Is made for purpose of ending this particular com petition in order to secure control of and enhance prices and create a mo nopoly. 

STATUTE LACKS DEFINITE?! ESS. The complaint Is made of tbe stat ute that it is not sufficiently definite In its description of that which Is for bidden to enable business men to avoid its violation. The suggestion is that we may have a combination of two corporations which may run on for years and that subsequently the at torney general may conclude tbat It was a violation of the statute and that which was supposed by the combiners to be Innocent then turns out to be a combination in violation of tbe statute. The answer to this hypothetical case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monopoly they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it cler.rly In mind. If what they do Is merely for the purpose of reducing the cost of production, withonMhe thought cf suppressing competition by use of the bigness or tne plant they are creating. then tboy cannot be convicted at the time the union Is made, nor can they be convicted later unless It happen that later on they conclude to sup press competition and take the usual methods for doing so and thus estab lish for themselves a monopoly. They can in such a case hardly complain if the motive which subsequently is dis closed is attributed by the court to the original combination. Much is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest mer chants and business men to follow. It may be that such . a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discus pions which have been brought out la recent days hy the fear of the con tinued execution of the anti-trust law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of action as defi nite and as clear as that which the su preme court itself lays down In en forcing the statnte. I see no objection, and Indeed I can see decided advantages, in the enact ment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced in the anti-trust law. The attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at a price so unprofita ble as to drive him out of business or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are re quired to give up association with oth er manufacturers and numerous kin dred methods for stifling competition and effecting monopoly should be de scribed with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten its task by prosecuting single misdemean ors instead of an entire conspiracy and on tbe other band to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community what must be avoided. FEDERAL INCORPORATION. In a speci.il message to congress or Jan. 7. 1010. 1 ventured to point riu the disturbance to business that would probably attend tbe dissolution of these offending trusts. I said: "Bat such an Investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders, but of millions of wage earners, employees and associated tradesmen, must neces sarily tend to disturb tbe confidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of boarding and pro duce a halt In our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstances among the Innocent many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish In this message to bring clearly to the con sideration and discussion of congress is whether. In order to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these busi ness combinations may be offered a means, without great financial dis turbance, of changing the character, organization and extent of their busi ness Into one within tbe lines of the law under federal control and super vision, securing compliance with tbe anti trust statute. "Generally in the industrial combina tions called trusts' tbe principal busi ness Is tbe sale of goods in many states and In foreign markets in other words, the interstate and foreign business far exceeds the business done in any one state. This fact will Justify the fed eral government In granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In Interstate and foreign com merce the products of useful manufac ture under such limitations as will se cure a compliance with the anti-trust law.- It Is possible so to frame a stat ute that, while It offers protection to a federal company against harmful, vex ations and unnecessary invasion by tbe states. It shall subject It to reasona ble taxation and control by tbe states with respect to Its purely local busi ness. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquir ing and holding stock in other corpo rations (except for special reasons, upon approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoiding the creation ' under national auspices of !ie holding company with subordinate corporations In different states, which has been such an effective agency In the crea tion of the great trusts and monopo lies. "If the prohibition of the anti trust act against combinations in restraint of trade is to be effectively enforced it Is essential that the national govern ment shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry on a le gitimate business throughout the Unit ed States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with re spect to foreign corporations make It difficult. If not Impossible, for one cor poration to comply with their require ments so as to carry on business In a number of different states." I renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to engage In trade and com merce among the states and with for elgn nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible objections has been confirmed by our experience since the enforcement of the anti-trust stat ute has resulted In the actual dissolu tion of active commercial organiza tions. It is even more manifest now than it was then that the denunciation of conspiracies in restraint of trade should not and does not mean the de nial of organizations large enough to be intrusted with our interstate and foreign trade. ' It has been made more clear now than it was then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate na tional and foreign commerce. 

GOVERNMENT EXPERTS NEEDED. ' The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization Into le gitimate corporations, has made it es pecially apparent that the courts are not provided with the administrative machinery to make the necessary in quiries preparatory to reorganization or to pursue such inquiries, and they should be empowered to Invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations in determining the suitable , reorganiza tion of the disintegrated parts. The circuit court and the attorney general were greatly aided in framing the de cree in the tobacco trust dissolution by an expert from the bureau of corpora tions. I do not set forth in detail the terras and sections of a statute which might supply jhe constructive legislation per mitting and aiding the formation of combinations of capital into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including effective pub licity, and to (he closest supervision as to the issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission in the department of commerce and labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that incorporation under a federal law could not exempt the com pany thus formed and its incorporators and managers from prosecution under the aatl-trust law for subsequent il legal conduct, but the publicity of Its procedure and tbe opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bureau or commission lu charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate luirpose of its transactions would offer it as great se curity aenlnst successful prosecutions ror violations of tbe law as would be practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be invested also with the duty already referred to of aiding courts in the dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. It should be an executive tribunal of tbe dignity and power of the comptroller of the cur rency or tbe interstate commerce com mission, which now exercises supervis ory power over Important classes of corporations under federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal in corporation law would offer ample op portunity to prevent many manifest You Coal Valley Chunks Mined with latest machinery, eliminating all impurities, rr 4am per ton Springfield Six .inch lump, (St4 Sf per ton 30LP Springfield Egg and Nut, fiy fm per ton ... ;fK4w3 Carterville, Harrisburg and Franklin county, (t lump, per ton f37Lr per ton $3.80 Peoria and Fulton county lump Ci4. per ton KJJ2 The above price s are for deliveries north of Eleventh avenue, south r f Elev enth avenue, 25 cents more.

I recommend that the federal char ters thus to be granted shall be volun tary, at least until experience Justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines ot the law. Other large combinations that fall to take advantage of the federal incorporation will not have a right to complain If their failure is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transac tions to the careful official scrutiny, competent supervision and publicity attendant upon the enjojinent of such a charter. The opportunity thus suggested for federal Incorporation. It seems to me, Is suitable constructive legislation seeded to facilitate the squaring of great Industrial enterprises to the rule of action laid down by the anti-trust law. This statute as construed by tbe supreme court must continue to be the line of distinction for legitimate busi ness. It must be enforced unless we are to banish Individualism from all business and reduce It to one common system of . regulation or control of prices like that which now prevails with respect to public utilities and which when applied to all business would be a long step toward state so cialism.
