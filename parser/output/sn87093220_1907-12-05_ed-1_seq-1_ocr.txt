WOLFF'S "SS2S2T [» THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Roosevelt Officially Addresses the Sixtieth Congress. Would Have Railroads Under National Charter. Currency Legislation. Abuse of Injunction Power. Tariff Revision Must Wait. Ad vocates Postal Savings Banks. Pay Campaign Expenses Out of Public Treasury. The president in his message to con gress says: No nation has greater resources than ours, and I think It can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation pos sess greater energy and industrial abil ity. In no nation are the fundamental business conditions sounder than In ours at this very moment, and it Is foolish when such Is the case for peo ple to hoard money Instead of keeping It In sound banks, for It Is such hoard ing that is the immediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people Is con ducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms and fac tories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercial enterprises. In any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and If the conditions are such that these men prosper or commit their misdeeds with Impunity their example is a very evil thing for the community." Where .these men are business men of great sagacity and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many Innocent people Into making in vestments or embarking In kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dis honest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the Innocent whom they have misled. It Is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs, and naturally when it does oc cur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty It Is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet It Is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ulti mate causes of the suffering and, as a i \eans to this end, where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of | opinion as to many governmental poli cies, but surely there can be no such differences as to tho need of unflinch ing perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty. Interstate Commerce. No small part of the trouble that w« have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self reli ance, of Independence in initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for Its fullest exercise compatible with seeing that liberty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately this Is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation Inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national government s!i(v:!.l have complete and sole control of interstate commerce. There was then practically no interstate business are . ;-li was conducted by water, ami t'iis tin? national government at once pr >cee 'e ,1 to regulate In thorough going and effective fashion. Conditions have no-.v so wholly changed that the Interstate commerce by water Is lnslg uiiicnnt compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in Interstate commerce. As a result it can be but partially and Imperfectly con trolled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states, such ac tion inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax and in either case ineffective for purposes of justice. Only the uational government con in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. Tills does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority already exists under the constitution In amplest and most far reaching form, but It does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. This Is not advocating centralization. It is merely looking facts In the face and realizing that centralization in business has already come and cannot be avoid ed or undone and that the public at large can only protect Itself from cer tain evil effects of this business cen tralization by providing better methods for the exercise of control through the authority already centralized In the national government by the conatttu (Continued on page aix.)
