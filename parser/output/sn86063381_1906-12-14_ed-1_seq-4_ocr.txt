i i FOR MORMON SUCCESS PRESIDENT CHARGED WITH US. ING HIS INFLUENCE AT RE- CENT ELECTION. SENT SECRETARY TAFT TO IOAHO SENATOR DUBOIS CLAIMS MOR- MONISM WAS ONLY ISSUE IN THAT STATE. Washington, Dec 14.President Roosevelt was directly charged in the senate during the day with using his influence for the election of Repub lican Mormon candidates in the recent election in Idaho and Utah. The charge was made by Senator Dubois in the course of a speech in which he discussed the right of Reed Smoot to a seat in the senate The address was of considerable length, the first portion being devoted to a review of the Mormon church Mr. Dubois as serted that polygamous marriages were still being contracted, although surreptitously, and that an aristocracy of polygamists was being built up by the church officials, who now arrange and select these polygamous mar riages. But no record of polygamous marriages is kept which is available for the American people. Because of this he pointed out the futility of pass ing a national law prohibiting the practice. As to Senator Smoot, he said, it made no difference whether he ^as or was not a polygamist. "Smoot," he said, "represents the church and not the state and would do the bidding of the church before he would serve the real interests of the state or of the nation Turning his attention to the cam paign preceding the recent election Mr. Dubois read the press dispatches of Oct. 22, which stated the president had sent Secretary Taft into Idaho to speak in Advocacy of Law and Order. At that time, Mr Dubois said, he had telegraphed the president that the only issue in Idaho was the desire of the Mormon hierarchy to continue to dom inate the politics of the state and that the president had been misled if he thought there was any other issue. Mr. Dubois referred to messages of Presidents Buchanan, Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur and Cleveland, oiting what he termed "the menace of Mormonism," and proceeded: "I call attention to these messages of the presidents for two purposes "One to indicate the views of our former executives the other to mark the contrast between them and the present occupant of the White House. Mormonism is more insidious, more dangerous and a greater menace to our government and civilization today than it was at any particular period when these messages were addressed to congress Yet President Roosevelt does not deem the subject worthy of mention in a message filled with sug gestions. "The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah and of Idaho think they are en titled to the support of law abiding citizens everywhere in their efforts to maintain American citizenship in these Mormon states and if they cannot re ceive that they have the right to de mand that the president of the United States shall not use the great power vested in him in the interest of those law defying and un-American organiza tions In their determination to rule the politics of this section of our country."

First Masses Celebrated Outside the Pale of Law. Paris, Dec. 14.There was an im pressive response to the clergy's ap peal to their parishioners to attend the first masses celebrated outside of the pale of the law A correspondent of the Associated Press visited a dozen churches, including Notre Dame dea Victoires, St. Germain d'Auxerrois, where the signal for the St. Bartholo mew massacre was given St Roch de Madelaine and St. Augustine. Ev erywhere it was the same stoiy. The front gates of the churches were closed, but the Catholics, by the gray light of dawn, were streaming through the side portals The interiors of the buildings were well filled in several places there was music, but nowhere was there the slightest attempt to in terfere with the service or create a disturbance. There were three police men stationed outside the porticos of the churches to prevent any possible disorder, while police officers in plain clothes were on duty inside to note the infractions of the law, taking the names of the officiating priests and approximating the number of those present with the object of making re ports to the justices of police Early dispatches from the depart ments say that wherever mass was celebrated chaiges were diawn up and summonses issued. At Chalons the Abbe Renaudin claimed that the church bells were not rung and that no person was invited to mass and that therefore the assemblage had not the character of a public meeting, whereupon he was compelled by a po lice officer to inscribe his protest upon the summons. 

STATE'S CONSENT NEEDED MINNESOTA MAY BLOCK NEW IS- SUE OF GREAT NORTH- ERN STOCK. St. Paul, Dec. 14.President Hill's proposed Issuance of $60,000,000 In new stock to the shareholders of the Great Northern Railway company may be sidetracked for the time being. Attorney General E. T. Young, in an swer to questions regarding the con templated issue of new stock, issued the following statement: "In my opinion thei is no doubt but that under a propel interpretation of the law as it now stands no new stock can be issued by a domestic railway company without obtaining the con sent of the state, through the railway commission. "Before such consent can be given the commission must give a public hearing on the question, in which hear ing the purpose for which the money is to be used and the necessity for the new issue of stock must be fully shown. "In showing the necessity for this issue the company would have to show what it did with the proceeds of the $25,000,000 stock issued last February, which has not as yet been accounted for in any public way. "This proposed issue would increase the stock of the Great Northern com pany to $210,000,000. "The bonds of the system are now about $215,000,000, which would make the capitalization of the 6,000 miles of road $425,000,000, which exceeds $70,- 000 per mile for both main line and branches, where much of the road, especially the branch lines, cost not to exceed $2,000 per mile. "The dividends on this excess cap italization is an unwarranted tax on the patrons of the road and, instead of increasing its stock, which is now about $60,000 per mile, the company ought to show some justification fpr its present capitalization."

BIG SLICE FOR THE STATE. Carnegie Advocates Heavy Inheritance Tax. New York, Dec. 14.Andrew Carne gie, in an address before the National Civic federation, said that he believed that the major portion of the estates of enormously wealthy men should go to the state upon the death of the pos sessor of the fortune. Mr. Carnegie opposed a graduated income tax. "I think an income tax would pene trate business to the core," said Mr. Carnegie. "I think this country would never regret anything so much as to impose such a tax. I differ with the president strongly on the subject of the income tax. But I am in a pecu liar position on the inheritance tax, advocating chat as something like get ting a better distribution of wealth. The subject of wealth distribution will not down." Mr. Carnegie said he believed, in asmuch as the wealth properly be longed to the community, the latter, on the death of the possessor, should acquire a great portion of the wealth, having had a large part to do with its development.
