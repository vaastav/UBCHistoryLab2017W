This is an application made by J. W. Richardson, Esq., for the discharge of Joseph Huntsman from the custody of William Read, Jailor of Monroe County. The application sets forth that said Hunts " n is confined in the jail of said County without any authority. The return of the u Jailor is, in substance, under oath, that he has no warrant, order, or other paper writing authorizing the detention of said " 'Huntsman, but$hat he was delivered to him, as jailor, by M.

The only person injured was a rebel who refused to surrender when requested, but the Cavalryman's sword coming down with a "whiz," cutting his ear off close to his head, brought him to terms. The greatest curiosity was the Rocket Battery, which by the way was captured from McClollan. The guns are about two feet in length, and five inches in diameter; the rockets are fifteen inches in length. The curious part about these infernal machines is, that they make no report when fired, until they explode. The manner of loading and firing is in this wise: insert the rocket about half its length, pull the fuze through a small hole underneath the gun, touch it with a coal and "phiz" it goes. This is the only expedition that ever accomplished anything at Blackwater. Wednesday evening when we returned there was a general rush made by the troops to see the Rebels. They exchanged compliments a follows: "How are you Butternut?" which was answered: "How are you Yankee?" Here is Gen. Dix's dispatch: A Fight Near Suffolk. THE REBELS DRIVEN ACROSS THE BLCKWATER.

The reader will find on our first page extracts ftoin. the press on the subject of the President's Message. It will be seen that the President's friends criticise his Message with far more severity than we have. Tho New York Evening Post, which is disposed to defend the acts of the Pres ident through thick and thin, says: " Mr. Lincoln is not a rhetorician of the Maeaulay school, who writes polished I!ritannia ware sentences. Neither is he a formal logician, whose premises r.nu con clu ioua carry conviction with them as irresistibly as a cannon ball carries death, litis reasonings nre not always rigid nor bis illustration happy, and his methods arc any ''-lug, but graceful. It trtii be a disappointment to the public ' that the President tells us nothing of the progress of the war; yet something should have bcn said, if not for the information of our own people, for that of people abroad." The New York Commercial Advertiser dwells also upon this cold-blooded indif ference, this apathy of sense and of con science in regard to the services and sac rifices of war: " In one respect the Message disap points us, and is indeed unsatisfactory. It is entirely silent on the domestic con dition of the country. Except from in cidental mention, the reader of the docu ment would have no idea of the mighty and exhausting conflict through which the country is passing, and which has been so fruitful of events during the past year. Our soldiers and sailors with their Gen erals and commanding officers of every degree are passed over in total silence, without a word of commiseration for the brave wounded and dead, or a genial par agraph for the living. Except that refer ence is made to the departments of War and Navy, the reader of the Message would not guess that we had an army in the field and a navy on the ocean. It is strangely barren of every word or idea that could lead one to suppose that war had slain its thousands and disease its tens of thousands since the preceding Message was penned, or that the insurgents had ex hausted their resources of blood and treas ure to overthrow the Federal Government, and the loyal States had poured forth their lives and their money in noble, self sacrificing efforts to sustain that Govern ment under the shock. No word of sym pathy with the past, or of cheer for the future. H We confess that this defect iu the Message surprises and pains us." - The Sprinfield Republican says: "Not a few will say that the President seems almost wholly eblivious to the great crisis that is upon the country, and the momentous necessity that rests upon the GoYernment, while he is absorbed in his scheme of compensated emancipation, the realization of which is in the far-off future if it is to come at all. Others still will scout his pet plan altogether, and declare it a waste of time and energy to consider it at all, while it is so palpable to every one that earnest war is the business of the hour, and that it is by war to the utter subjugation of the slaveholders, that sla very is to be abolished, and not by the consent of the slaveholders themselves." The Oswego Commercial Times, forget ting that Lincoln's stump speeches were I not written by him, and that his Messages ' troro a o vre "We confess we are disappointed in the Message. Since be became President, Abraham Lincoln seems to have abandon ed altogether that forcible and eloquent style which rendered his speeches famous. We look in vain for any such ringing sentences as those contained in his im promptu speech at the Cooper Institute, prior to his nomination for the Presidency. The Message is plain, straight forward and rather heavy. He makes no appeal to the feelings, he touches none of the finer emotions of the human heart; he makes no effort to stir up the patriotism of the people to high and lofty deeds for Union and liberty. Does the elevation of a man to the Presidency blot out of his mid all the eloquence and poetry it may have previously contained?" We have quoted exclusively from Ad ministration journals. With all their partiality and with "cry interest inviting them to apologize for and sustain the Pres ident, they condemn both the manner and matter of the Message. They all ac knowledge the defects of style which make this State paper a national opprobrium. They regret the absolute silence with which the war and its sacrifices are passed over, and they refu?e their assent to the recom mendations which it eontains. We know of no exceptions. A few are silent; but the rest condemn. THE 

DIFFERENCE. Mr. Lincoln's Abolition postmaster at Wheeling is the editor of a paper there which deliberately and undisguisedly cal led for some Charlotte Corday to step forth and assassinate Mr. Vallandigham ! This proposition was copied with appro val into the Cleveland header, a newspa per edited by auothcr of Mr. Lincoln's postmasters. When Kces, of the Circle- ville Watchman, expressed surprise that tho men of New Orleans did not shoot Butler for having brutally insulted their wives and daughters, he was sent to Fort Delaware. Has any one ever heard of the postmaster at Wheeling or Cleveland be ing reproved for calling for the assassina tion of Vallandigham, whose crimes con sisted in having dared to fearlessly repre sent the sentiments of his constituents? Newark (O.) Advocate. ADDITIONAL FOREIGN NEWS. The great prize-fight for the champion ship of England, between Jim Mace and Tom King, took place on the 26th of November. After fighting twenty-one rounds, most of which were in favor of Mace, King put in one of his sledge-hammer blows and knocked Maee insensible. Mace could not come to time, and King was declared the victor. It is reported that John C. Heenan has agreed to fight King for the championship, each man to put up 500 per side. The Rochester Unin on the MESSAGE, Probably two-thirds of the whole mes sage we have not made, any accurate measurement-is devoted to "tne inevi table nigger." It favors us with one more Abolition programme i scheme which is intended to culminate in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hun dred! If Congress, aud the people, and rebels, and "the rest of mankind "' only adopt the plan ho new presents, and will adhere to it faithfully and undeviatingly through the balance of the century, and Mr. Lincoln will refrain from hatching up some still newer soheme with which to supersede the one now under considera tion-why, if all these things shall hap pen, then thirty-seven years hence, alter twenty or thirty millions of whites now inhabiting or hereafter to inhabit this country shall have gone to their graves, the niggers will all be free ! Whew, what a glorious spectacle to contemplate ! But a little circumstance, too insignificant, however, to be mentioned in a message devoted almost exclusively to the exalta tion of the niggor, ought to be mention ed in this connection. This beneficent scheme, reokoning from its indistinct and shadowy beginnings, will have cost the lives of more than five hundred thousand robust white men. slain in battle or dying of wounds or disease received or contract ed on the field or in the camp; it will have made tens of thousands of widows, and probably hundreds of thousands of or phans; it will have filled our country with the crippled and the maimed; it will have devastated some of the fairest por tions of the whole earth; it will have en gendered hates and animosities which even the grave can but partially extinguish for they will descend to the children of thousands who have no other heritage to bequath; and it will have cost in the fruits of human labor (including principal and interest) vastly more thaB all the wealth of the whole country now in existence. The President keeps his eye and his mind io steadfastly upon the nigger that all these things have escaped him. He seems to value the "war power," the power to amend the Constitution, the power to is sue "shinplasters," the power to fight and the power to make peace, only as they can or can not be made subservient to the nigger ! The war per se is ignored. Ex cept incidentally, it is not even mentioned in the message. The faet that a million of his fellow-citirens (white men) are absent from their homes, incurring the dangers and undergoing the discomforts and pri vations of a state of war, seems to have made no impreseion on his mind. The nigger monopolizes his attention, and alone affects his sensibilities. The hun dreds of thousands of homes once happy, now filled with anxiety for their absent husbands, sons, fathers many of them destined to return no more seem to find no place in Mr. Lincoln's thoughts. But the present and future condition of the black race absorbs all his powers of reflec tion, and furnishes almost the only topic for his official theme. It is noteworthy that Mr. Lincoln maintains the silence of the grave on the subject of arbitrary arrests. Men as loyt.l as himself, and as mu?-h entitled to liberty as he is to the occupation of the Presi dential chair, have been arrested on an illegal order, transmitted by telegraph, hurried off to distant prisons, kept for months without being advised of the charges against them, and finally discharg ed without trial, indemnity, apology or explanation. But all these men are white, and the President has not one solitary word in their behalf, or in behalf of the sacred rights which have been violated in their persons. This message, as we remark in conclu sion, will lower us, and especially our Government, in the estimation of the whole civilized world. Every intelligent and candid American at home or abroad will feel humiliated by it. But enough.

This shows how "vigor ous" his Excellency is for the prosecution of the war. So strong opposition to the so-called free labor party exists in North Carolina that no election for representatives to the Thirty seventh Congress will be ordered in that State.

Davis of New York, dated November 20th has been published, in which he says that it is his fixed purpose, when relieved from his present post, to be, and remain as long as he shall live, a pri ate, but at tho same time a loyal citizen. So settled is this purpose that he should not relinquish it even though places were opened to him, not grudgingly or upon compromise, but voluntarily and by ac clamation. These remarks were drawn forth by propositions to him to become a candidate to the Senatorship from New York. 

GENERAL McCLELLAN AND POR TER'S LETTER. Major General Fitz John Porter: I ask af you, for my sake and that of the country and the old Army of the Po tomac, that you and all my friends will lend the fullest and most cordial co-operation to Gcnerla Pope in all the operations now going on. The honor of our arms now depend upon the cheerful co-operation of all in the field. This week is the crisis of our fate. Say the same thing to all my friends in the army. This is the last request I have to make that for our country's sake you will give to General Pope the same assistance you have given to me.

Head Quarters, Army of the Potomac, December 11th, 9, A. M. J Everything last night was hustle and activity, as to day was the day fixed for crossing the river. During the night the pontoons were conveyed to the river, and the artillery to the number 143 pieces, were placed in position opposite the city. At 5 this morning the rebels fired two signal guns, and during the latter part of the night roekets were frequently seen within their lines. At 5 o'eleek, the con struction of three bridges, in front of the eity, was commenced. When the bridges were about half completed they opened a murderous fire of infantry from the houses on the river bank. Up to this time, not a shot had been fired from our side. The Engineers were driven from the bridges, and several killed and wounded. At 6 o'clock Gen. Burnside ordered all the guns to be opened on the city. The cannonade which has continued up to this time, is terrible. The city is on fire and its destruction appears certain. Tbe enemy about 7 this morning opened with their heavy guns from their works but so far, have done no serious injury. Gen. Franklin constructed his bridges about 3 miles below the city, meeting with but slight opposition. His troops are now crossing and the gunboats are shell ing the enemy, about 15 miles down the river, where they have been concentrating their forces for the past few days. The concentrated fire of our batteries on the city has had the effect of moving back the enemies infantry and the work on the bridges has been resumed. The troops are all under arms near the river, prepared to rush over as soon as the bridges are completed. 12 o'clock, M. An attempt being made to finish the bridges in front of the city, the rebel infantry again opened their fire The artillery in position again opened en it, the result being that it was fired in several new places. The enemy has used very little artillery up to this time, as it would endanger their own men, who are holding the river in front. Gen. Burnside has just issued an order to concentrate every available gun upon the city, under the cover of the fire of i which it is believed the bridges can be finished. The killed arnd wounded do not amount to more than 50 man. LATER. Evening But little firing took place between one and three o'clock, during 1 which time all the available batteries were placed iu position. They numbered 176 j guns. At a signal all opened en the city. j The fire was terrible, but the rebel sharp shooters could not be driven from their , hidiug places. j The shot and shell went through the houses, in many cases setting them on fire, i causing dense smoke, which together with the explosion of so large a quantity of ! powder, almost hid the city from view. It soon became evident that the bridges could j not be built, esceptby a bold dash. Vol , unteers were now called for to cross in small boats. Tbe order was no sooner ' given than, hundreds stepped forward, but all could not go; about 100 was selected, j They were soon on their way, while the ; artillery threw- a perfect storm of iron ; hail on the opposite bank. They reached ' the opposite shore, but not without loss, witn oxeu Dayonets. iney rusnea upon the enemy killing several and taking 101 prisoners; who were safe landed on this ide. At half past 4, two bridges were finished opposite the city, when the troops immediately began to cross over. The enemy were then very soon driven from the city, back tcutheir line of works. The two bridges in front of Gen. Franklin were successfully laid early in the day, but his troops did not cross until the two! upper ones were ready. A sufficient force is now on the opposite side to resist anv attack that is likely to be made. The rebels fired but few guns in the morning and none in the afternoon, although their works were in easy range during the fore noon. The rebels burned the railroad bridge outside of the city. Between 30 and 40 houses were burned, mostly in the business part of the city. During the day between right and nine thousand rounds fired by our artillery. Everything is quie) to-night. The indications are that a battle will be fought to-morrow. Later Our Forces Cross Over and Fredericksburg is Ours I Aquia Creek, Midnight, Dec. 11. In telligence from the front to-night states that our forces have crossed the river, and are now in possession of Fredericksburg. The enfilading fire from our batteries on the right succeeded in driving the rebels from their rifle pits on the river's edge, thereby permitting an easy and rapid construction of pontoon bridges. Friday, Dec. 10 o'clock A. M. After occupying the river in front of the city last night, we lost about 100 men in killed and wounded. While driving the rebels through the city they fired on our men as they ad vanced through the streets, while secreted in and behind houses. Not much mercy was shown to those who were caught. This morning a dense foe hid everv tiintr fmm v5a hat now it. iK narti'.ll cleared away. The troops commenced . ' . J moving at anlsarly hour, Maj. Gen.

General Franklin's grand division, which crosses nearly three miles below the city, is nearly over. At o'clock the first gun was fired the engagement lasting about a half hour, the rebels not making a very spirited re ply. It is thought the troops will be over at noon. Headquarters Armt of the Potq mac, Dc. 12. At 10 o'clock this morn ing the fog begin to clear away, but before 12 the air was again thick, which continu ed until two o'clock, when it entirely dis appeared. At 2 o'clock the rebels opened with all their guns posted on the first ridge of the hills. Their main force was directed upon ha eity, which was filled with our troops. The Battle Near FayAriAvill a r v a Arc a a f Battlefield, Nkau Fayittkvillk, Arkansas, December 8, 1862. Gen. Herron's forces en route to rein force General Blunt, met the enemy yes terday en Crawford Prairie, ten miles south of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and won a decisive victory over them. The enemy twenty-four thousand strong, were divided into four divisions, under Generals Lar sons, Marmaduke, Frost and Reins; and all under General Hindman embrace the flower of the trans-Mississippian Army,' well supported by a park of eighteen pieces of artillery. The enemy flanked Blunt's position at Cane Hill, and made a suddee attack on Herron to prevent him uniting with Blunt. Herron's force con sisted of the Ninety-fourth . and Thirty seventh Illinois, Nineteenth and Twenti eth Iowa, Twenty-sixth Indiana, Twenti eth Wisconsin battalion, two of cavalry; in all from six thousand five hundred to seven thousand men, and twenty-four pieps of artillery. The battle raged from ten in the morning till dark, and was desperately fought throughout. Our ar tillery drove the enemy from two strong positions and kept their overwhelming numbers at bay. The Twentieth Wisconsin captured a rebel battery consisting of four heavy guns, but wero forced to abandon them under a murderous fire. The Nineteenth Iowa also took the same battery, and fought most desperately, but were also obliged to yield it. Almost every regi ment distinguished itself. About four I o'clock Gen. Blunt arrived from Cane Hill, with 5,000 men and a strong force of orfi t low nnn attanuarl t h. .n.m n , ti tnp : : :z r rear, lhe rebels to capture his batteries, but wererepi , . r , , 1 sries. but were repulsed , with terrible slaughter. Ws held the whole field at dark, and before nine o' clock that night the entire rebel force was in full retreat over Boston Mountains. Our loss in killed and wounded was 600, sod that of the rebels 1,500 by their own admission. Several of the enemy's field officers were killed; among them Colonel Stein, commanding a brigade, and former ly of the Missouri Guard. Only few prisoners were taken. We captured four oaisona filled with ammunition. Lieut. Colonel McFarlan, of the Nineteenth Iowa, was the only field-officer killed on our side. Major Hubbard, of the First Missouri Cavalry, was taken prUoner. The Situation on the Rappa- hannock Detths from Exposure A Porward Movement Impossible The Enemy Still in Force.

During the last forty-eight hours large quantities of supplies were prevented from landing from the Acquia aud Potomac Creeks by low water and ice; the latter is fully two inches thick. Notwithstanding this, the army generally is provisioned twelve days ahead. No movements of importance to-day. Many regiments are industriously engaged in erecting huts, as if preparing to spend a winter hereabouts.

Pope's offioial statementji, in regard to Sigel, excite great indignation through the army. Sigei is held in high esteem among our best officers. Headquarters Rkjht Grand Division, December 8 10 A. M. Owing to greatly diminished length and breadth of girtbr of camp-fires visible night before last, the impression was prevalent that the enemy had fallen back to a new position, some distance to the rear of their former line. The immense volumes of smoke seen last evening, on the opposite side above the hills overlooking Fredericksburg, and seeming to extend for miles in a western and northwestern direction, demon5lrated that a presumed retrograde movement, if made at all, was meant only to bring them under better shelter. The apparent fact of the continued pres ence of the great body of the rebel army in front of the right grand division, can be but gratifying to Burnside, for reasons that will be developed in a few days. It is presumed Stonewall Jackson, with his force, has taken a position on the extreme left. THE 

PRESS SUPPRESSED. The Wheeling Daily Press has for some time been one of the worst aids to treason in Western Virginia. It is the organ of Senator Carlile, who has betrayed the free State interests of his const tucnts, aud is better fitted for a Senator at Richmond than Washington. So vile has the Press , , , , become that the brave and loyil General Milroy has entirely suppressed its circula tion within the lines of his command. Its treasonable course should kill it dead. We are surprssed to see such a para graph as the above in the Cleveland Herald, which we had looked upon as a fair Re publican paper. The Wheeling ProsB is one of the ablest and best Union papers in the country, as we can attest from a daily perusal of its contents. Our point with the Herald is this: Is it willing to have every man who happens to wear shoulder-straps assume the responsibility of a censor over its columns, and to pass upon its loyalty! Should some Democrat ic or conservative General, from malig nant, political hate, exclude it from his lines, would it give a loud cackle of re joicing over it, and commend the patriot ism of the Generrl who did it? Yet, it is a poor rule that don't work both ways. Does the Herald wish to see a political warfare carried on iu this manner? A fifa ire jri TonnTri flnlraid Stanley Matthews has .

These, indeed, arc figures at which tha country may well stand aghast. The public have been robbed by job bers, and by fraudulent mismanagement, of full one-half cf these euoruious sums in the expenditures. And now let us know who, for six months, hss been authorising the lying statements we have been receiving as qwsi official from the Treasury Department.' - We have no doubt that the claims snd unascertained, but rightful, indebtedness of this war, when footed up, will increase our debt, at the present moment, to two thousand millions of dollars! Our debt is now larger, in proportion to our wealth and ability to pay it. than that of Great Britain. We have run it up in two years, but it has taken Great Britain eight hun dred years to run up hers !
