A vast majority their situation Is not satisfactory at of the voters of th land are ready all points. Some of them to whom al- to Insist that the time and attention of lotmentBof land have been made are found to be unable or disinclined to follow agricultural pursuits or to oth erwise beneficially manage their land. This is especially true of the Chey ennes and Arapahoe, who, as it ap pears by reports of their agent, have in many instances never been located upon their allotments, and in some cases do not even know where their al lotments are. Their condition has de teriorated. They are not self-support ing, and they live in camps and spend their time In idleness, I have always believed that allott ments of reservation lands to Indiana those they select to perform for them Important public duties, should not be distracted by doling out minor of fices, and they are growing to be unan imous In regarding party organization as something that ahould be used In establishing party principles Instead of dictating the distribution of public places as rewards of partisan activity, Numerous additional offices and places have lately been brought within civil service rules in regulations and some others will probably soon be In eluded. The report of the commissioners will In severalty should bo made sparingly, be submitted to the congress, and I In vite careful attention to the recommen dations it contains. A NATIONAL BOARD Of HEALH. I am entirely convinced that we ought not to be longer without a national board of health or national health offi cer charged with no other duties than such aa pertain to the protection of our country from the invasion of pestilence and disease. This would involve the wretched pauperism of the allotees establishment by such board or officer, or at least slowly and with tbe ut most caution. In these days when white agricul turists and stock-raisers of experience and intelligence find their lot a hard one we ought not to expect Indians un less far advanced in civilization and habits of Industry, to support then selves oq the small tracts of land usu ally allotted to them. If the self-sup porting scheme by allotment falls the which results In worse than their orig inal condition of regulated depend ence. It Is evident that the evil conse quences of ill-advised allotment are in tensified In cases where the false step cannot be retraced on account of the puroTiase by the government of reser vation lands remaining after allot- of proper quarantine precautions or the necessary aid and counsel to local boards o hea th and health off.cers In the suppression of contagimu dis ease and in cases where there m m such local boards or officers, the im mediate direction by the national board or officer of measures of sud- Ll10 101IlCblIiail& "wiw hm.v.

The indications are that the detail of army officers as Indian agents will re sult in Improved management on the selves of their benefits. - THE TARIFF. The tariff act passed at the last ses slon needs Important amendments neaervaltlona Whenever allotments if it is to be executed effectively and are 'made' and any Indian on the res ervation has previously settled upon a lot and cultivated It, or shown a dis position to improve it in any way, such lot should certainly be allotted to him, and this should be made platn- wiith oertainity. In addition to such necessary amendments as will not change rates of duty, I am still very decidedly In favor of putting coal and iron upon the free list. So far as the sugar schedule is con ly Obligatory by statute. In the light cerned, I would be glad, under existing of experience, and considering the Un- aggravations to see every particle of certainty of the Indian situation and differential duty in favor, of refined Its exigencies in the future, I am not sugar stricken, out of our tariff law. only disposed to be very cautious in If with ail the favor now accorded the msjting allotments, but incline to J sugar-refining interest In our -tariff agree witn the secretary of the lnterl- laws It still languishes to the extent or In the opinion, that when allotments closed -refineries and thousands of are made the balance of reservation discharged workmen, it would seem to iana remaining after allotment, in- present a hopeless cose for reasonable eteaa or being bought by the govern- legislative aid.

I earnestly recommend it prompt repeal. ths oold raonitx. During the last month th gold re aerved In the treasury for th purpoa of redeeming th note, of the govern ment circulating as money in th hands of th people to become so re duced, and Its further depletion In the near future seemed so certain that In the xrclae of proper car tor th pub- no welfare it became necessary to re plenish thl reserve and thus maintain popular faith in the ability and deter mination of. th government to meet as agreed, Its pecuniary obligations. It would have been well if In thl emergency authority bad existed to Is sue the bonds of the government bear ing a low rate of Interest and maturing within a ahort period; but the con gress having failed to oonfer such au thority, resort was necessarily bad to th resumption act of 1875, and pur suant to Its provisions bonds were is ued drawing interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum, and maturing ten year after their Issue, that being the shortest time authorized by the act. I am glad to say, however, that on the sale of these bonds th premium re ceived separated to reduce the rate of Interest to be paid by the government to less than three per cent Nothing pear at such partle In garments most could be worse or further removed from sensible finance than the relation ex isting between the currency the' gov ernment has Issued, the gold held for Its redemption, and the mean which must be resorted to for replenishing such redemption fund when Impaired. Even if the claim upon this fund were confined to the obligations origin ally Intended and if the redemption of these obligations meant their cancella tion, the fund would be very small. But these obligations when received and redeemed In gold are not' cancelled, but are reissued and may do duty many times by way of drawing gold frrfm the treasury. THus'we have an endless chain In .operation constantly depleting the treasury's gold and never near a final rest. As if- this wa not bad enough, we have, by a statuary declaration, that it 1 the policy of the government to -maintain the parity be tween gold and sliver, aided the force and momentum of this exhausting process added largely to the currency obligations claiming this peculiar gold redemption. Our small gold reserve Is thus subject to drain from every , side, The demands that Increase our danger also Increase the necessity of protect lng this reserve against repletion, and it is most unsatisfactory to know that the protection afforded la only a tem porary palliation. It is perfectly and palpably plain that the only way under present con ditlons by which this reserve when dangerously repleted can be depleted through the lasueand sale of the bonds of the government for gold; . and yet congress has not only thus far declined to authorize the issue of bonds best suited for such a purpose, but there seems a disposition In some quarters to deny both the necessity and power for the issue of bonds at all. I cannot for a moment believe that any of our citizens are deliberately wll ling that their government should de fault In its pecuniary obligations or that Its financial operations should be reduced to a silver basis. At any rate should not feel that my duty was done if I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a calamity. As long there fore as no provision Is made for the final redemption or the putting aside of the currency obligation now used to repeatedly and constantly draw from the government Its gold, and as long as no better authority for bond Issues la allowed than at present exists such au thority will be used whenever and as often as It becomes necessary to main tain a sufficient gold reserve, and in abundant time to save the credit of our country and make good the financial declarations of our government. THE 

CURRENCY. Questions relating to our. banks and currency are closely connected with the subject just referred to and they also present some unsatisfactory- fea tures. Prominent among them are the lack of elasticity in our currency circu lation and Its frequent concentration in financial centers when It is most needed in other parts of the country. The absolute divorcement of the gov ernment from the business of banking Is the ideal relationship of the govern ment to the circulation of the curren cy of the country. This condition can not be Immediately reached; but as e step in that direction , and1 as a means of securing a more elastic currency and obviating other objections to the pres ent arrangement of bank circulation. the secretary of the .treasury, presents In his report a scheme- modify ng- pres ent banking laws and providing for the issue of circulating notes by . state banks free from taxation under cer tain limitations. The secretary .ex plains hla plan to plainly and itsi ad vantages are developed by hint, with such remarkable clearness, that any effort on my part to present argument in its support would be superfluous. I shall, therefore, content myself with an unqualified indorsement of the, sec retary's proposed change In the taw and a brief and imperfect statement of their prominent feature, - , .tlK I is, proposed to repeal all . laws pro viding for the deposit of United States bonds as security for circulation! io permit national banks to Issue circula ting note not exceeding In. amount sevenfy-flv per centr of their paid up and unimpaired capital, provided , they deposit with the government, as a guarantee fund, In United States le gal tender notes. Including treasury notes ot low, s sum equu in amount to thirty per cent of the notes they de sire to issue, thl deposit t be main tained at all times, but whenever' any bank retires aofy part' of its circula tion a proportional part of its fuaran ty fund shall be returned to it; to "per mit the secretary of the treasury : to prepare and! keep on hand ready for is- sue in case an Incww in circulation tt desired by any national notes for J or Increase their clrculatlon-thu per- MDITOJt WilDKR A hKN

Dec l.-Th mar- In addition to the guarantee fund re- nm" 01 Anu wiwer, formerly quired, It I proposed to provide a safe ty fund for the Immediate redemption of the circulating note of fulled bank, by Imposing a smalt annual tax, ay one-half of one per cent upon th av erage circulation of each bank until the fund amounts to five per cent of the total circulation outstanding. When a bank fall It guarantee fund 1 to be paid Into thl safety fund and its note are to be redeemed 1n the first Instance from uch safety fund thl augmented any impairment of auch fund caused thereby to be made good from th Immediately available cash assets of said bank, and It these should be Insufficient such Impairment to be made rood by pro rata aascsment among tb other banks, their contribu tions constituting a first lion upon the asset of the failed bank in favor of the contributing bank. Aa a further security it Is contemp lated that the existing provision fixing lb individual liability of stockholders is to be retained and the bank In debted loss on account of Its circulating note Is to be made a first lien on all It asset. For the purpose of meeting the ex pense of printing notes, official super vision, cancellation, and other like charges there shall bo Imposed a tax of say one-half of one per cent per annum upon the average amount of notes In circulation, It Is further provided that there shall be no national bank notes Issued of a less denomination than ten dollars. That each national bank, except in case of a failed bank, shall redeem or retire Ita note .in the first Instance at Its own office or at agencies to be designated by if, and that no fixed re serve need be maintained on account of depositors. Another very important feature of this plan is the: exemption of state banks from taxation by the United States In cases Where it Is shown to the satisfaction of the secretary of the treasury and comptroller of the cur rency by banks claiming such exemp tion that they have not had outstand ing their circulating notes exceeding seventy-five per cent of their paid up and unimpaired,, capital; that their editor of th Palladium of New Haven, Conn., but now th proprietor of the Madison (Wla) Dully Journal, to Mis Isabella T.

The general market was weakened in the early trading by the advance In Sterling Exchange, which revived the talk about gold exports. A number of bankers now assert that the chances favor shipments of the yellow metal this week. The .early decline averaged about per cent. After a while the market cut away from the Industrials and moved up all along the line, the views of President Cleveland in his message to congress on currency reform having been well reoelved. Covering of short contracts attracted special atten tion. This movement was most pro nounced in the grangers, one firm hav ing bought about 10,000 shares of North west. This concern has been picking up St. Paul and Northwest recently and allowing for matched orders, manipulation, etc., it must have se cured a round amount of these stocks of late. Whether this means a change of front on the part of the bear opera tor who tea his Account wjth the firm In question, remains to be seen, The Improvement in the general list ranged from to 1 per cent., Northwest leading.
