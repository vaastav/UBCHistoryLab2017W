VISITORS CROWD THE CITY. Mnny Attractive Displays nnd Curious Novelties Eleven Great Departmental Buildings. Charleston, S. C Dec. '-The South Car olina, and West Indian Exposition wis for mally opened to the world to-day with words of greeting from the President of the United States The invocation was deliv ered by the -venerable Charles 9. Vedder of the Huguenot church and Captain F. W. Wagcner, president of the exposition com- pany, and Governor M. B. McSweeney spoke words of welcome. Thousands of visitors w ere present at the opening. Chauncey M. Depew, United States Sen- ator from. New York, orator of the day, was then Introduced by Major Smith. Mr. Depcw said In part: "This exhibition Is the triumph of revolu tion and evolution. There ha- been no pe riod since the Colony of South Carolina adopted the theoretical but Impracticable charter prepared by the great phUoopher, John Locke, In 1674. down to the treaty of Paris with Spain, in 1899, when this happily conceived enterprise was possible until now. It Is an cmen of future development and prosperity for Charleston that the moment Ita citizens saw the time had come they en tered upon this beneficent work with pa triotism, courage and confidence. 'It required nearly a century and a half of struggle and preparation before there rrlated an Industrial and manufacturing South In the United States, and Spanish islands In the Caribbean Sea free and inde pendent to meet upon the common ground of united welfare and reciprocal benefits. -Jtaectrlclty and steam, the instantaneous drcUnff of the globo with news and rapidity In transportation have made one market for all the world. Reduction of cost and superi ority of workmanship are the factors of modern competition. Building the cotton mOl beside the cotton fields and the furnace and atael factories by the ore and coal are redartrlDoting industrial centers. Upon these linos; and by the application of these princi ples, the South, from no place In 1S66. has come to the front In the production of Iron and coal, and while New England and tho Western States have practically reached the profitable limit and are standing still in the expansion of the manufacture of cotton goods, there has been the phenomenal In crease of 1.307,000 spindles during the year 100 In the Carollnas and their neighboring commonwealths. Capital and enterprise. which are utilizing wood for Us varied pur posesindustrial, domestic and commercial are converting the vast pine forests of this rich territory Into settlements of thrift, productiveness and happiness. "Except for the broader conception In Its creation, this exhibition would worthily jus tify its existence as a celebration of the most wonderful contribution to the most re markable of centuries. Surely nothing In the story of the rise, decay and resurrec tion of nations equals the development and progress In the last third of the Nineteenth Century of the States which are bounded by the Ohio and Potomac rivers on the north, the Gulf of Mexico on the south, the Mis sissippi on the west and the Atlantic Ocean n the east. "But this fair is more than a memorial of the glories of the era which recently closed so brilliantly. It confidently and hopefully enters the Twentieth Century with the high and patriotic mission of promoting closer and mutually beneficent relations with neighboring countries and communi ties. The teachuigs of this industrial exhi bition, carried by visitors from the West India Islands and the South American States to their homes, will enforce the les sons of reciprocity, and open here and there new and growing markets." At the conclusion of the Senator's oration. Mr. Wagener stepped to the wire connecting- the Auditorium with the Executive Mansion in Washington and sent greeting to President Roosevelt. A few minutes later the response of the President was re ceived and the exposition was formally declared open. A number of State days have been arranged, the first on the list being Utah. December 4 is the day as signed. Object of the Exposition. The principal object of the exposition Is to make a fully representative display of the manufacturing progress and commercial possibilities of the country, and particularly of the Southern States. A commercial problem at this time confronts the South, and perhaps the supreme purpose of the fair is to solve It. The great advance In the number of cotton mills constructed and the output of finished products has created a surplus or cotton goods. Of this product. China was at one time the largest con fUtner outside of the home markets. The recent disturbance In that country, how ever, has virtually paralyzed the markets and the home surplus multiplies.

Hospital Association Fund May Reach $2,",000 This Year Count Not Completed. Church collections for the Hospital Sat urday and Sunday Association, which were made In all of the St. Louis houses of wor ship Sunday, show a big increase over last j ear's contributions. The total amount ob tained has not been ascertained as yet, but several of the churches that reported yes terday materially increased their gifts of the j car before. Full returns have not been received from other sources, but the officers of the asso ciation are satisfied that the collections will nearly reach t23.O0O. which is a large In crease over last year, when only $18,812 was secured. This year the collections in the office buildings were noticeably larger than they have previouslv been, and there were liberal donations from the trades and other sources. When some of the ladies were offering the badges in one of the prominent office build ings Saturday an old man. illy clad and stricken with a maiadv that nude a cripple of him, approached one of them to make a purchase. He produced his mite In very small change and It looked as if it might be all that he had. but there was a smile on hU face when he cave it and he seemed very proud of the tag that was handed Mm as a receipt for his gift. "I have just spent eight months in one of the Institutions that Is supported bj this fund." said he. "and I know that the little help that I am able to give will go to a good purpose. I would have been dead If It had not been for the care that was given me and I could not have had the attention if some one had not made It possible by giving help to the hospital." Quite a sum for the Hospital Fund was raised by a 'prominent oung lady in a well known cafe Saturday evening when the campaign for donations was under way. There was .1 large bouquet of carnations oi the table, and some one suggested that she auction the flowers, which she did. The bidding was spirited, .ind .ifier a very ex citing conlrst. which attracted the rivalry of all the gentlemen in the room, the bou quet was knocked down to one, who paid $J0 for the prize. As the others wero d's H r pointed because the) did not get the flowers, the bouquet was returned to the young lady by the purcht'er and resold by the bud.

PRIVATE FURS SEIZED FOR CUSTOMS DUES. Mr. J. R. Lewis, the Consignee, 8a ts Purchase Price Included the Duty. Sealskin furs, the property of J. R. Lewis, a local stock broker, of Xo. 4f14 Washington avenue, were seized last Friday afternoon bj Wllburn F. Bunn. special agent of the Treasurj' Department at Washington. D. C, on the charge that the goods were Imported from Canada without the payment of the required duty. Mr. Lewis cas that the seizure does not worrj him in the least, since the duty vas Included In the price of the fure, and since he can show positively that he had no In tention to defraud the Government. Several das ago Colonel J. A. Montgom ery, special agent in charge in St. Louis, received notification that Mr. Lewis had re ceived bj express a consignment of goods bought in Montreal. Canada. Investigation showed that Mr. Lewis had received a package of the kind described, and Special Agent Eunn called upon Lewis in his down town office. Lewis admitted that he had received the goods and wont out to his home with the special agent, where he turned over the furs. The property was placed In the hands of Charles II. Smith, customs officer of thls port, who will hold It pending action on the case In Washington. , Mr. Lewis said last, night that he had bought the fur. which, ho claims, reprjsent a valuation of about KM. from Charles DesjardliL. S. Sors of Montreal. "It is lbsolutely untrue." said he, "that I did or attempted to smuggle the property into the United Slates. The question of duty came up between me and th firm from whom I bousht. and, as I understood, the duty charge-- were to be Included in the purchase price. It was the arrangement that the furs were then to be "nt to me in Xew Tork. I received them In the latter place and brought them with me to St. Louis." PASTOR ESCAPES THROUGH A WINDOW. Flees From Church to Escape the Wrath of Young Men He Had Denounced. After denouncing two voung men who, he said, had disturbed an Epwortlt League meeting at the Washington Street Metho dist Chur'h in Alton. Sunda, the pastor, the Rev erend J. W. Borah, jumped through a window and escaped the vengeance of those whom he had upbraided. With him went several members of the congregation, who found the same convenient avenue of escape. Throughout the panic that followed when onef of the men who had been rebuked drew a revolver the minister's brave little wife stood up and coolly held her ground. After a time order was restored and the excited pastor, with his child, was found. The mother seemed less frightened than any who v Itnessed the occurrence. Two oung men came to the meeting as ccorts of two oung lady members of the church, and while the services were going on. It Is said, persisted in talking loudly. The were admonished by the pastor, but paid no heed Finally the minister threat ened to send for the police. This made the joung men more offensive, and finally sev eral members retired in quest of an officer. It was then that one of the men drew a re volver from his pocket and flourished t, with a threat to ivenge the rebuke admin istered to him. Instantly there was a panic In the church. The pastor evidently thought that he was to be the center of attack, and with agilitv he sprang to a near-by window and quickly madt his "tit. After securing a footing on the ground h stopped long enough to have his wife hand him out their baby, and then he made tracks as fast as he could for a place of safety. The wife did not follow him. but sta ed and faced the excitement. While frightened members were climbing over tiers of seat In an effort to Ilnd a door or a window, several husky oung men s-truggled witn tne men wlio had caused all the trouble and succeeded In getting them out of the church. OTIcers McKee, Brenner nd Winkler soon were upon the scene and placed under arrest Joseph and Alfred De muth, who were taken jesterday before Police Magistrate Few and bound over for trial under J30O bord. It was said at Alton yeterday thit the Reverend Mr. Bornh had gone to Lebanon. Mo., to tender to tho Presiding Elder his resignation. Mr. Boraii is a stuuent at Mc Kendree College while -arrlng on his min isterial work, and is an athletic vouns man who has some renown on the football gridiron, having been connected with the jlcKendree team In several of Its contests. The oung men who are Involved In the difficulty are brothers and belong to a prominent Alton family. The disturbance caused a big sensation In Alton.

The annual -e-rcrt of the Iowa Railroad Commissioners sajs In part: -The absorption of the smaller lines by the lirger ones will be, on account of the safeguards provided by the railway laws of this State. Deneticlal rather than otherwise to the peorle ot the State, it has had the effect not only of placing the weaker line In a higher class, thereby reducing the max imum freight rates proposed by the board, but also f making a continuous mileage rate In case of shipments that, previous to this absorption, had to bear the burden of two or more short-distance or local ntaa." SCRAP IRON TRUST IS TALKED OF. Itepm-t Tlmta Combine Will Con trol the Market for Thin Commodity. MAY HAVE $10,000,000 CAPITAL Two Luinl LJuveix Say DwiIlhs Should !N"ot lie Alarmed De pend on Law of Supply and Demand. Dealer in scrap iron and steel in St. Louis are interested in the reports that come from the East announcing the prob able formation of a scrap iron trutt, with a capital of 110.000 OuO. for the purpose ot controlling the market for this commodity. Rumors of some such movement have been thick ever since the Republic Iron and Steel Company, several months ago, made an effort to buy all Ita scrap iron and steel directly from the producers. This un dertaking, so the dealers assert, dll not meet immediate or decided success, and it is their blief that It will not be prolonged greatly. "The Iron and Steel Companj of Amer ica" is said to be the name of the proposed new trust. It is also said to be the Inten tion of the Incorporators not only to buy scrap Iron and steel, but to manufacture all products of those and other metals. "I do not put much faith in the report." said F. Majer of Xo. 10J) Xorth Twelfth street jestcrdav. "Even if tome of these reports should lie true it need not unduly alarm the regular dealers. The law of sup Ply and demand will very quickly settl anv trouble that maj arise. If an attempt should be made to force up the prfi.es of iron and -teci scrap such a sunolv unuM come from Europe that the price would go the other wa). "I rememLer a similar case several ears ago when manj dealers expected to sef wrought iron bring at least 4 cents a pound. More than a million tons of the metat were on the oeean at one time, coming here to supplj the extraordinarj demand. The re sult was that the price fell from Jt a ton to 110 a ton in less than slxn iijis. Thi. same thing will happen again if the trust or an combination of dealers attempts to force pi ices out of their legitimate range. The dealers hardlv- need to organize to win that fight." S. Schwartz ot Xo 1219 Xorth Eighth street aid that he had heard --evcral times recently of proposed consolidations, but be licved that nothing would come of them. "If an thing of ths kind should be at tempted," he said, the dealers would be able to fight effectivelv. The railroads do not now sell much of their old material to deal ers, but deal directly with manuafcturers. The rest of the trade we certainly can make a stubborn fight for. At the worst, the manufacturers could only refuse to buy what we had to sell, and there is nothing to prevent the building of a new mill, if that should become necessarj. in order to make a market for our scrap."
