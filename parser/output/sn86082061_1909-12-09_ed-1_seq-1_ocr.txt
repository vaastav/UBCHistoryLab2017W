Death of Mra. A, J. Curtia. ! Mra. Philura Jane (Cbadwick), wife of Andrew J. Curtis, died at 1:30 o'clock: Friday morning after months of great Biiffprlnff from a ranrflrnnl trnnhle. Due. I ing much of her life Mrs. Curtis had been frail In health and bad known many hours of pain and sickness before tbe final break-down, which came about a year ago. The third of last July she was taken to the aanatorium to find, if possi ble, relief through surgical treatment but her case proved to be so far advanced and , so complicated that tbe only course to pur sue was to husband her strength 'and to minister to her comfort. 8 lie rallied for a little so that ahe left the aanatorium tc make in her own home a brave struggle against tha encroachments of disease and finally to meet there tbe great change which awaited ber. ' Mra. Curtis waa born in .Randolph, Jan. 17, 1849, the daughter of Samuel and Betsey M. (Brewster) Cbadwick. All her life was spent In her native town with tbe exception ot a few years of ber childhood during which ahe lived in Lowell, Mass. In 185 she married Mr. Curtis, who is indeed bereft in tba aundered tiea of 45 years of close companionship. Six chil dren were born to tbem and died in early infancy with tbe exception of two daugh ters, Gertrude, who lived to ba alx years old, aud Winnie, who only aurvived one year. Besides ber husband, Mrs. Curtia left a brother, E. H. Cbadwick ot Leba non, N. H., and two sisters, Mra. C. W. Proper of Randolph and Mra. John Knowles of Campton, N. H. Aa an attendant of tba old Christian church, tbs deceased waa devoted to ita interests and, upon its union with tbe Cong'l body, transferred ber allegiance to the resulting Bethany church and became enrolled with Bethany guild.

John Q. tbe Angeli of Stowa Methodist church wiU next A Good Play end Good Caat. Such was the satisfactory combination in "Tha Third Degree," presented in Chandler Musio ball Mondxy night, to which it attracted about 400 spectators. A special train over th White River rail way brought 60 or more people, 38 of tbem from Rochester, and the general ap proval seemed to be unqualified. Many who bad fixed on some previous attrac tion, like "Tha Lion and the Mouse," by tbe same author, "Pierre of the Plains," or "Paid in Full," as the high water mark of excellence in dramatic art, were inclined to lower tbe old favorite to aeo ond place and pronounce "Tbe Third De gree" aa "the beat thing yet," while no one, apparently, failed to recognise the merit of tbs piece and Its production. As a literary work, "Ibe Third De gree" of Charles Klein is a play to which that much abused word "strong" can ba rightfully applied. It bas a plot which compels Interest, and a purpose, in set ting forth tbe atrocities of modern crim inal procedure, la carrying out that purpose so well as It does, it shows bow the stage, under certain direction, ia hardly less powerful than the pulpit, and perhaps farther reaching, in an effort to quicken tbs publio conscience. Marion Kerby, in tbe itar role of Annie Jeffries, gave a masterly impersonation of tbe brainy but uncultured woman, whose native wit, unpolished by books, commands respect, while tba simple goodness of ber nsture, untrammelled by artificialities, is a force not to be lightly set aside. Miss Kerby plsyed the dia mond in tbe lough and made it outshine the faceted gem. drpe Nomner locked and acted like a judge of tha supreme court aa he por trayed Richard Brewster, who, much against his will, bad to yield to bis better nsture, uncesaingly prodded by the per sistent wife, Annie Jeffries, nntil he fin ally undertook tbe defence of her hus band in tba murder case against him. As a legal light Mr. Sumner waa a fascin ating mixture ot dignity and humor and the dry witticisms of bis part (lid much to relieve tha tragic character of tba play. Gladden James adapted himself natur ally and easily to the role of tha weak and foolish college boy, Howard Jeffries, Jr., led into an imprudent marriage and caught In the meshes of tbe city police system. He did some part icularly good acting in tbe second scene of the first act, when tba "third degree" waa worked noon biro and, in a hypnotic condition, he confessed to a crime which he never committed. Tbe police captain, Clinton, who ex torted the confession, was the impersona tion of Jack Klhs and, though he may bave been guilty of exaggeration, be suc ceeded in cresting a recognirahle figure of tbe burly, domineering type quite often found in office. The part of Mrs. Howard Jeffries. Sr., was admirably taken by Irene Oshier, who played tha ladv, tbe finished prod uct of society, in sharp contraat to tbe character of Annie Jeffries. Howard Jeffries, Sr., wsasrtfully mads detestable by Cbarlea Hill Mailiw, who represented a father so entirely devoid of human feel ing as to justify tbe daugbter-in-lew in calling biro a 8n. These five actors did the real work of the play but they had adequate support in tbe minor parts of tbs plsy, and the state settings were all that could be desired. preach in Sunday.

Tba pictures of Annette Kelleramn, the fam ous iwimmer, the Mauritania and New York city from a skyscraper are admira ble. Jack Barnett's unusually pleasing illus trated songs and numerous comedy films give added interest to the program. Tbe realistio noise effects with tbe pic tures are very well produced.
