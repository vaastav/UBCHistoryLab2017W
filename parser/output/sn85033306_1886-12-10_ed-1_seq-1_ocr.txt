THE AMERICAN NAVY. What Secretary Whitney Reports as to the Nary Department. Washington, Dec 4. Tbe report of Secretary of the Navy Whitney, given out last night, opens with a renewal of his former recommendation for tha consolida tion of bureaus so as to insure responsibility In purchase and care of supplies, and states that so far as his power extended he had consolidated in one bureau the general pur chases of department and the care aud cus tody of stores, creating a system of book keeping by which the responsibility for care aud disposition could be had. The re port says: "There is at present no real re sponsibility for the care aud disposition of property. In one bureau a property ac count is kept and in others none. Property lost, missed or stolen can not be traced or accounted for and no person can be heid re sponsible. The Fourth Auditor In his re port just issued calls attention to this re markable circumstance which was also re ferred to in my last annual report. The lu veutory shows a very large and unnecessary accumulation of stores and supplies by the different bureaus, aggregating over twenty millions of dollars iu appraised value. The board reports between three and four mil lions in value to be obsolete and useless at the present time, only entailing expense for keepers and coustaut care to preserve them iu condition." Regarding the new cruisers the report says: "The experience of the department iu its first attempt at the creation of modern vessels of war has been such as to excite the greatest concern and disappoint ment. When the Dolphin, Boston, Atlanta and Chicago were projected and contracts for their construction entered into it was well known what speed ought to be at tained and what weight and character of machinery per ton of displacement was necessary to obtain it. Commercial vessels had at that time attained speeds ranging between sixteen and nineteen knots and cruisers were being built in other countries, or had already been built, attaining the same speed." The Secretary compares (rial trips of the Doluhin and Atlanta with English and French boats only recently completed totlie disadvantage of the former. The Dolphin was designed fur 2,300 indicated horse power and developed less than 2,200, while the Alacrity and Surprise, English boats of 3,000, developed 3,173 and 3,079 respect ively. The Atlanta was designed to attain 3,500 horse power, but her engines devel oped less tUan that. The report s;iys: These facts -are stated without any inten tion of locating the responsibility or blame upon any person. It is impossible to ascer tain where it should be placed. In considering the matter of constructing the additional vessels authorized by Con gress in March, 18S5, it was decided by the department to exhaust every effort to avail itself of the most advanced thought and knowledge attained by our own aud other countries upon the subject. The report says the department has accumulated a large amount of Information which will be utilized in the construction of vessels in the future. The report then gives a resume of the bids and awards for the new cruisors. It also treats of armor and guns for moni tors and ironclads at great length and dep recates that this country should be content to be dependent upon manufacturers of any other nation for the fabrication of ar mor and high-powered guns. ; The report says: "It would be a great i benefit at the present time if the appoint ! nient of a commission should be authorized ' to lay before the next Congress a compre hensive scheme of construction, such com mission to bo composed of both civilian and naval expert's fit to deal with the subject. If Congress should at its next session 1 make provision for the manufacture in this country of armor and of high-powered guns aud should take steps for securing broader and more intelligent consideration proper . to be undertaken, no time would in the : end be lost and mistakes would he avoided. ' Meanwhile it is my duty to call attention ' to the urgent necessity for Immediate action." Concerning the expenditures the report says: "In the adjustment of the accounts , for the fiscal year ended June 30, 18S6, and ! after paying all liabilities for the year, i it is believed that there will be an uuex I ponded balance of from $000,000 to $050,000, j almost one-half of w hich is pay of the navy ! and pay of the marine corps, showing an expenditure of $13,500,000 or upwards of $500,000 less than the appropriations. These amounts do not include tho expendi tures for steel cruisers and completion of the double turreted monitors." It is cited that this is the first time in many years that the expenditures have been kept with in the appropriations. The Secretary recommends that the Naval Academy course be shortened to four years, as recommended by tho commander of tho academy. He also urges that apprentices be admitted to the academy, and says: "It is the desire of tho department that the naval service should not bo open to any charge of exehisiveness the sole exception to this sound and wholesome principle of our national policy. To this end it would recommend that measures be taken by which, under proper safeguards, admission to the Naval Academy minht be given to a limited number of apprentices, who should then be subjected to the same course of training and examination as the other cadets, and who, under the application of a uniform test, should stand or fall solely ac cording to the strength or weakness of their own merits." m At the Kml of His Hope. Worcester, Mass., Dec. 4. Mrs. Geerge M. Ilice, of Uxbridge, was at home iu North Oxford when Levi Wilson was born, ami she had watched him grow up from an infant to childhood.

She also said that the record of Wilson's birth at Oxford was correct. She thinks that Wil son is not in his right mind and does not know of any mystery.

Colonel Wright, Commissioner of Labor, expects to complete hi3 second annual report about January. It Is grappling with some important aud far reaching questions. First, he asrrees to have a complete Investigation of convict labor and its effects upon free labor. The result of this inquiry will show that, taken as a whole, the value of the product of manufactured goods produced in prisons, and of work done by convicts, bears a shiall proportion to the total products of the1 country. Examined, however, iu details, the facts will disclose that certain lines of industry have undoubtedly been seriously injured by the employment of con vict labor to the detriment; of free labor. The total prison population of the United States at the present timo is 57,331 of this number .2,739 are at work and 4,593 idle Of the total num ber at work 48,838 are male and 3,901 female. The methods of employment are interesting. There are under contract, 14, 939; under lease, 9,2ai; employed at piece work, 2,'JSO; employed on publio account 1,697, and in prison duties, 8,850. New York enjoys the gloomy pre-eminence of having the largest prison population, aggre gating 9,033, aud Pennsylvania ranks second, with 5,533; Massachusetts conies next, with 3,819; Illinois, 3,329; Ohio, 3,221; Michigan, 2,628; Tex:is, 2,539, and so ou down to Mr. Bayard's pocket borough- Delaware which closes the list With eighty nine. These convicts are principally en gaged in liiteen pursuits, as follows: Agri cultural implements, boots and shoes, build ing, carriages and wagons, clothing, con struction, farm, furniture, iron goods, laborers, leather goods, mining, stone worir, wooden goods, prison work. The average contract prices paid for this work is from 40 to 50 cents per day. The effect of this is undoubtedly to depress prices and labor in the industries in which prison lahof comes in competition with free labor. For example, prison labor in the manufacture of boots and shoes has depressed the prices of these goods, some say, as much r-s twenty five per cent. The States in which tl e con tract system prevails are Connecticut, Illi nois, ludiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesjtat Mis souri, New Hampshire, New Yo! k, Ohio, Oreeon, Pennsylvania, iihoile Isl.in 1, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia hi d Wis consin. In three of these States, htftever, the contract system has recently been abolished by law. These are New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The contract sys tem has also been entirely abolished recent ly in California and New Jersey. In these States the piece plan has been substituted. more'wrecks.

Special telegrams to UrudstrctV s point to moderate gains in the movement of general merchandise from Boston, New York, Baltimore, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Paul, Minneapolis, New Or leans and San Francisco. Except in so tar as this is due to increased breadstuff's and other exports from the Atlantic seaports named, the gain is due to a stimulated re tail demand for dry eroods, groceries and notions, owing to cold weather anil to the approach of the holiday season. There is no material change at Philadelphia, Pitts burgh, Cleveland, Louisville, Chicago, St. Louis aud Kansas City. At most points a widespread confidence is reported in the fu ture of general trade, notwithstanding a no ticeable check to the movement of goods from Crsthands in textile and other lines. The.total bank clearings this week at thirty two cities show the unprecedented in crease of 262.000,000 over last week, the total being $1,263,740,793 against S 1.000. 000,503 a week ago, and 1,097,24",690 tor the week ended one year ago. 'this is an increase of 2t per cent, over last week and 16 per cent, over th- like week last year. The week's gain at New York alonn is 154,700,000, or about 20 per cent., due very largely to the heavy speculative trans actions in railway shares and bonds and petroleum and produce exchange dealings.

TRACK' v The Many Obstacles in the Way of Return. tev. T. De Witt Talinage Telln How the Shackles of Itad Habits May Be I'nrlv ited, and How the Paths of Vir tue May Be Regained. Cleveland, O., Dec. 5. Rev. Dr. Talmage preached in this city to-day. He took for his text the. thirty-fifth verse of the twenty third chapter". 6f Proverbs : "When shall I awaitet I will seek it yet again." Bis sub ject was: "Off the Track How to Get oil Again." The sermon is as follows : With an insight into human nature, such as no other man ever reached, Solomon, in my text, sketches the mental operations of one who, having stepped aside from the path of rectitude, desires to return. With a wish for something better he said: " When shall I awake I When shall I come out of this horrid nightmare of iniquity?" But seized upon by uiieradieatad habit and forced down hill by his passion he cries out : " I will seek it yet again, 1 will try" It once more." Our libraries are adorned with an ele gant literature addressed to young men, pointing out to them all the dangers and perils of life complete maps of the voyage, show.'ng all the rocks, tho quicksands, the shoals. But suppose a man ha3 already made shipwreck; suppose he is already off the track? suppose he has already gone astray, how is he to get back? That is a lield comparatively Untouched, 1 propose to address myself this morning to Sut'H. There are those in this audience who. With every passion of their" agonized souh are ready to hear such a discussion. They compare themselves with what they were ten years ago, and cry out from the bondage in which they are incarcerated. Now, if there be any in this house, come with an earnest purpose, yet feeling they are be yond the pale of Christian sympathy, and that the preacher can hardly be expected to address them, then, at this moment; I give them my right hand, and call them brother. Look up. There is glorious and triumph ant hope for you yet. I sound the trumpet of Gospel deliverance. The church is ready to spread a banquet at your return, and the hiernrcha of Heaved ta fall iuto line of bannered procession at the news Of your emancipation. Ha far as God may help me, I propose to show what are the obstacles to your return, and then how you are to surmount these obstacles. The first difficulty in the way of your re turn is the force of moral gravitation. Just as there is a natural law which brings down to the earth any thing you throw in to the air, so there is a moral gravitation. In other words4 it is easier to go doWn thafl it is to go up; it is easier to do wrong than it is to do right. Call to mind the comrades of your boyhood days some of them good, some of them bad: Which rrost affected you? Call to mind the anecdotes you hare heard in the last live or ten years some of them pure and some of them im pure. "Which the more easily sticks to your memory? During the years of your life you have formed certain courses of conduct some of them good, some of them bad. To which style of habit did you most easily yield? Ah! my friends, wo have to take but & moment of self-inspection to find OUt that there is in all souls a force of moral gravi tation. But that gravitation may be re sisted. Just as you may pick up from the earth something and hold it in your hand towards Heaven, just so, by the power of God's grace, a soul fallen may be lifted towards peace, toward pardon, toward Heaven. The force of moral gravitation is in every one of us, but there is power in (Sod's grace to overcome that forco of moral gravitation. The next thing in the way of your return is the power of evil habit. 1 know there are those who say it is very easy for them to give up evil habits. I do not believe them. Here is a man given to intoxication. He knows it is degrading his family; de stroying his property, rviining him, body mind and soul. If that man, being an in telligent man, could easily give up that habit, would ho not do so? The fact that he does not give it up proves that it is hard to give it up. It is a very easy thing to rail down stream, the tide carrying you with great force; but suppose you turn the boat up stream, is it so easy then to row it? As long as we yield to the evil inclinations in our hearts, and our bad habits, we are sailing down stream, but the moment wo try to turn we put our boat in the rapids just above Niagara, and try to row up stream. Take a man given to the habit of tising tobacco, as most of you do, and let him re solve to stop, and he finds it very difficult. Twenty-one years ago I quit that habit, and I would as soon put my right hand into the l":re as once to indulge in it. Why? Be cause it was such a tcrrilic struggle to get over it. Isow, let a man be advised by his physician to give up the use of tobacco. Ho goes around not knowing what to do with himself. He can not add up a lino of fig ures; he can not sleep nights; it seems as if the world had turned upside down; he feels his business is going to ruin; where he was kind and obliging he is scolding and fretful; the composure that characterized him has given way to a fretful rest lessness, and he has become a com plete fidget. What power is it that has rolled a wave of woe over the earth and shaken a portent in the Heavens? He has tried to stop smoking! After awhile ho says: "I am going to do as I please. Tho doctor does not understand my case. I am going back to my old habit." And he re turns. Every thing assumes its usual com posure; his business seems to brighten; the world becomes an attractive place to live in; his children, seeing tho difference, hail the return of their father's genial dis position. AVhat wave of color has dashed blue into the sky, and greenness into the mountain foliage, and the glow of sapphire into the sunset? What enchantment has lifted a world of beauty and joy on his 6eul? He has gone back to smoking. Oh! the fact is, as we all know in our own experience, that habit is a taskmaster; as long as we obey it it does not chastise us, but let us resist and we find we are to bo lashed with scorpion whips and bound with fchip cable, and thrown into the track of bone-breaking juggernauts. During the war of 1S12 there was a ship set on lire just above Niagara Falls, and then, cut loose from its moorings, it carao on down through the night and tossed over the falls. It was said to have been a scene "ui'illiant beyond description. Well, there i.re thousands of men on fire of evil habit, coming down through the rapids and through the awful night of temptation toward the eternal plunge. Oh! how hard it is to arrest them. God only can arrest them. Suppose a man, after five or ten or twenty years of evil doing, resolves to do right. Why, all the forces of darkness are allied against him. He can not sleep nights; he gets down on his knees in tho midnight and cries: "God help me!" he bites his lip; he grinds hia teeth; he clenches his fist in a determination to keep his purpose; he dare not look at the bottles iu the window of a wine store. It is one long, bitter, exhaustive hand-to-hand fight with inflamed, tantalizing aud merciless habit. When he thinks ho is entirely fi ee, the old inclinations pounce upon him like a pack of hounds with their muzzles tearing away at the Hanks of one poor reindeer. In Paris there is a sculptured represen tation of Bacchus, the god of revelry. Ho is riding on a panther at full leap. Oh, how suggestive! Let every one who is speeding on bad ways understand he is not riding a docile aud well-broken ste,eJ, but 1 is riding a monster, wild and blood thirsty, going at a death leap. How many t here are who resolve on a better life aud t-.iy; "When shall I awake?" but seized on I n their old habits cry: "I will try it oueo ; ..r.-; I will cH it yet again!" Years ,.. there were some Prmctou bUKteuts a who were stating, and the Ice was fii'f thirl, and noma one warned the company back froni tll air-hole; and finally warned therri entirely to ie"arJ tho place. But one young man" with bravado, after all the rest had stopped, Coi outJ "One round moro I" He Swept around, and Went down, and was fertfaght out. a corpse. My ffimdsf there are thousarxis and ten of thousands of tneil losing their soul that way. It is th one round more. I have also to say that if a man Wall id rturn from evil practices society repulses him. i?c's!riig to reform, he says: "Now, I will shake off liiy "VI associates, nnd I will find Christian compan'fCsbip." And he appears at the church, door son'.'e" Jal bath day, and the usher greets him wiih it look, a much as to say : " Why, jTou here! You re the last man I ever expect ed to see at cltjlr'ch f Come, taka this seat right down by the door?" instead of say ing: " Good morning t I airi glad you are here. Come, I will give you a nrst--fat seat, tight by the pulpit." AYell, tha prod igal, not yet ifnuraged, enters a prayer, meeting, and some Civilian man, with more zeal than common sense, ?ays i "Glad to see you. The dying thief was saved,- nd I suppose there is mercy for you." TliS younsf man, disgusted, chilled, throws him self back on his dignity, resolves he msv er will enter tlw houaa of God again. Per haps not quite fully disguto"d alwut refor mation, he sides up by some highly respect able man ho used to know, going down thu street, and! immediately the respectable man has an errand cwn some other street. Well, the prodigal, wishing" !r otrn, takes some member of a Christian Assoc'iffUoir by the hand, or tries to. The Christian ycill is g man looks at him, looks at the faded apparel andfthe marks of dissipation, and instead of giving him a Warm grip of tho hand offers him the tip end of tho long lingers of the loft hand, which is equal to striking man in the face. Oh, how few Christian people under stand how much force and gospel there is in a good, honest hand-shakmfi I Some times, when vou have felt the need VI en couragement, and some Christian man has" taken you heartily by tho hand, have you riot felt thrilling a through every fiber of your bodj iiiirtd mid soul en encourage ment that was just what you needod ? You do not know any thing at all about this un less you know when a man tries to return from evil courses of conduct he runs naainst repulsions innumerable. We say of senile man, he lives a block or two from the church, or half a mile from the church. There are peoples iri our crowded cities who live one thousand miles from church. Vast deserts of indifference between them ttttd the house Cf Gad. The fact is, we must keep our respectability though thousands and tens of thousands perish, uhrist sat with publicans and sinners. Bu't if there come to the house of Gol a man With marks of dissipation upon him, people throw up their hands in horror, as much as to say! "Isn't ft shocking?" How these dainty, fastidious Christians in all our churches are going to get to Heaven I do not know, unless they have an especial train of cars, cushioned and Upholstered, each one a car to himself! They cuii not gd with the great herd of publicans and sin ners. O ye, ttho url your lip with scorn at the fallen, I tell you" pkinly. if you h ul been surrounded by tho same iifMi?ee.cs, instead of sitting to-day amid tha cultured and refined and the Christian, you would havo been a crouching wretch in stable or ditch, covered with filth and abomination ! It is not because you aro naturally any better, but because the mercy of God has protected you. Who are you that, brought up in Christian circles, and watched hy Christian parentage, you should bo so hard on tho fallen! I think men also are often hindered from return by tho fact that churches are too anxious about their mtdrbership and too anxious about their denomination,- "d they rush out when they seo n. man about to give up his sin and return to God and ask him how he is going to bo baptized, whether by sprinkling or by immersion, and what kind of Church he is going to Join. OI my friends I it is a poor time to talk about Fresbyterian catechisms, and Episcopal liturg.esj and Methodist love-feasts, and Baptistries, to a man that is coming out of the darkness of sin into the glorious light of tho Gospel. Why, it reminds me of a man drowning in the sea, and a life-boat puts out for him and the man in the boat say.i to the man out of the boat, i "Now, if I get you ashore, aro you going to bvo in my street?" First get him a-ihore, ami then talk about the non-essentials of religion. Who cares what church he joins, if he only joins Christ, and start for H javenl O, you ought to have, my brother! au illumined fuce and a hearty grip for every one that tries to turn from his e.'il way. Tuk.i hold of the sanv.i book with him, though his dis sipations shake th.i book, re:nembring that he that converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and hide a multitude of sins. Now, I have shown you these obstacle? because I want you t: understand I know' all the difficulties in the way ; but I am now to tell you how Hinnibal may scale tho Alps, and how tho shackles may bo unriv eted, and how the path3 of virtu s forsaken may bo regained. First of all, my brother, throw yourself on God. Go to Him frankly and earnestly, and tell Him those habits you have, nnd ask Him if there is any help in all the resources of Omnipotent love, to give it to you. Do not go with a long rigmarole peoplo call prayer, made up of " ohs" and "ahs" and " forever and forever ainens !" Go to God and cry for help! helpl help! and if ym can not cry for help, just look and live. I remember in the late war I was ut Antie tam, and I went into the hospitals after tho battle, and I said to a man : " Where aro you hurt?" He made no answer, but held up his arm, swollen aud splintered. I saw vhere he was hurt. The simple fact is, when a man has a wounded soul, all he has to do is to hold it up before a sympathetic Lord and get it healed. Oh! it is no small thing, when a man is nervous, and weak and exhausted, coining from his evil ways, to feel that God puts two Omn!tob:rit arms around about him, and says: "Young man, I will stand by you. The mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but I will never fail you." And then, as the soul thinks the news is too good to bo true, and can not be lieve it, and looks up in God's face, God lifts His right hand and takes an oath, an affidavit, saying: "As I live, sait.li the lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dicth." Blessed bo God for such a Gospel as tldi! "Cut the slices thin," said the wife to tho husband, "for there will not be enough to go all arou id for the children; cut thn slices thin." Blessed be God there is a full loaf for every one that wants it bread enough and to spare. No thin sue h at the lord's table I remember when the Master street hospital in Philadelphia v.ts opened during the war a telegram came saying: "There will be three hun dred wounded men to-night, lie ready to take care of them," and from my church th"re went noma twenty or thirty men and women to look after these poor wounded fellows. As they came, some from one part of tho land, boiii-j from an other, no one asked whether this rnun was from Oregon, or Massachusetts, or Minne sota, or from New York. Thero wa1 a wounded soldier, and the only question was how to take off the rag niimt gently, and put on the bandage, and administer the cor dial. And when mjuI comes to God, He dexm not ask where you came from or what your ancestry wus. Healing for all your wounds. Pardon for all your guilt. Com fort for all your troubles. Then, also, I counsel you, if you want to get back, to quit ull your bad associations. One unholy intimacy will fill your soul with moral distemper. In all the ages of the church there h:i not t-en an iusture-e where a man kept one evil associate and was reformed. Among the l,4ot .ici,tj f the race not one instance. io l.x.ie u day, t-i;u your desk, tuko out letter imiwt. stamp ftn3 envelope, and then write a let ter something like this : "My old emanlojis; I start this day for Heaven. Until 1 n persuaded you wiTlJoin. me in this, farewell." Then sign your name, end wnd the letter with the first post. Give up yemr bad com pantonn, or give up Heaven. It fs not ten bad companions that destroy a mil a, nor five" bad companions, nor three bad com panions, but one. What chance is there for" that young man 1 saw along tho street, four or five youngmen with him, halting in front of a grog-shop, urging him to go in, ho re sisting, Violently resisting, until after awhilo they forced him to go in? It was e. summer night, and tho dor was left open, and I saw the process. They hold him fast, iid they put the cup to his lip", and they forced down- the strong drink. What chance is thero for such a young manl I counsel you, also, ek Christian udvico. Every Christian man is bound to help you. If you find no other human ear willing M bsten to your story of struggle, come to me, and I will, by every syr.ipathy of my heart, and every prayer, and every toil of my hand, stand beakh? you in tho struggle for reformation; and, I hope to havo tny own sins forgiven, ami lnpo to be ne qiiHted at the judgment seili of Christ, I will not betray you. First tf all, seek God then StfeS Christian counsel. Gather up all the energies of body, mind and .tul. and, appealing to God for success, doel;"?V this day everlasting war against all drink ing habits, all gaming pructiees, all houses of sin. Half-and-half work will amount t nothing; it must ho a Waterloo. Hhriuk: back now, und you aro lost push on, un-i you are saved. A Spartan General fell at tbe very moment of victory, but lie dipped his linger in his own blood and wrotn on a rock near Which ho was dying: "Sparbi has conquered." Though your struggle t get rid of siu may dwis almost a deiit.lt struggle, you can dip your linger in your own blood und write on the Kork of Ages: " Victory through our IamI Jesus Christ." Oh, what glorious news it would 1C for some of these young men to send home i their parents in tho country these holiday U'ht-'h are coming. They go to tho post office every day or two to see if there urn any letters from you. How unxioim they are to hear! You might send them for u. holiday present this season a book from mm of our best publishing houses, or acomplet-j wardrobe from the importer's palace; it Would not please them half as much as tin news you miKht send home to-morrow that you had given your heart to God.

In the farm-house at night no candle is" lighted, lor the llamos claw their hands about the great black log, and shalu the shadow of the group up and down tl.rf wall. Father and mother sit there for hal f. an hour, saying nothiug. I wonder what they are thinking of. After awhile father breaks tho silenco and says: " Well, 1 wonder where our boy is in town to night?'' and mother answers: " In no bul place, I warrant you; wo always could trust him when no was home, and since he has been away there have been so many prayers offered for him, we can trust him still." Then at eight o'clock for the v re tire eariy in the country they kneel down and commend you to that God who watch" in country and in town, on the und land oa the sea. Homo one aid to a Grecian General i "What was tho proudest moment iu your life?" Be thought a moment, and sail: "Tho proudest moment in my life wa when I smt home wont to my parents that I had pa hi CM the victory." And the proud est aud most brilliant moment iu your life will bo tho moment when you can send Word to your parents that you have con quered yo:ir evil habits, by tin) tfraeo of God, and beconto eternal victor. Oh, de spise not parental anxiety ! The time will come when you will have neither father or mother, und you w ill go around the place where they used te watch you, and find them gone from tho hrus?, and gone from the field, and gone from neighborhood. Cry as loud for forgiveness as you may over the mound in the c hurch yard, they will not answer. Dead I Head I And then you will take out the white lock of hair that was cut from your mother's brow just before they buried her, and you will take the cum: with which your falh'-r used to walk, und you will think nnd think, and wish 1 hut you had done just as they wanted you to, and would fc'ivo the worM if you hud never thrust pang throu;Tl their dear old hearts. God pity the young man who has brought dlsgraeo on his father's naun! God pity the young man who has broken his moth er's heart!
