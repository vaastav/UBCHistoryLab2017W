Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune « THE UTAH DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ■Washington, Dec. 10. —The Utah Eepreeenta tives here are somewhat agitated over the ap pointment, which was sent in to the Senate to day, of a United States District Attorney in place of Geo. 0. Bates, removed. The latter, it will bo remembered, sympathizes with the Mor mons in the war which was made upon their local laws one year ago, and was triumphantly vindicated by the Supreme Court in its session last spring. The successor to Mr. Bates is Mr. Wm. Carey, of Galena, 111., a well-known law* yer in the latter place. Mr. Carey is now here, and indicated that the appointment is not altogether to his taste. However, it is probable that he will accept. His sympathies in the Mormon difficulty are rather with the Gentiles, % at least so far as general principles are concerned. TEMPERANCE. The Senate, to-day, indulged in an hour’s dis cussion over the disposition to be made of the memorable temperance petitions with which this body has been flooded since the session opened. Inasmuch as some of those petitions contem plated the prohibition of both the importation and manufacture of intoxicating liquors, it was considered proper to refer them to the Finance Committee. The Chairman of this' Committee, however, reported them bock to the Senate to-day, with tne request that they be dis charged from their further consideration. Thereupon a lively debate sprang up as to whom these matters should go. The difficulty of a reference seems to be in the fact of tha differ ences in the subject matter petitioned for. Some want a constitutional amendment on the subject; others want the sale absolutely prohib ited, and others want the manufacture. and im- Sortation checked. In the confusion of counsel io Senate passed the whole matter over. THE MISSISSIPPI. Senator Trumbull presented a memorial to the Senate to-day, numerously signed by the citi zens of Minnesota, protesting against the pas sage of a bill now docketed in tbe calendar, and 5 which is entitled “An act to perfect naviga tion on tho Mississippi Eiver,” This bill was introduced by Senator Pomeroy, last session, and was intended to amend a former act, ap proved July 28, 1868, by which 200,000. acres of land were granted to Minnesota, to aid in the improvement of the Mississippi Eiver, to be selected at tbe rate of one section in a township, and to be sold to actual settlors, at the usual Government price per acre. It changes the spirit and scope of the original act, so as to provide that pine lands may bo selected and sold in satisfaction of the original grant of 200,000 acres, without reference to the condi tions of selection and sale originally provided. Tho memorialists object that, although Pome roy’s bill provides that the pine lands shall be sold at public auction, to the highest bidder, and the sales shall cease when @230,'- 000 has been realized, yet that it is wholly silent as to when, whereby, by whom, at what minim-nm price, or tm what no tice tho sales shall be made. They nlaim that the effect of this bill, if it becomes a law, will be to give the control of all the remaining plno timber lands in Minnesota, belonging to tbe General Government, to a corporation, consist ing of a few persons, and known as the Missis sippi Elver Improvement and Manufacturing Company, to whom the State Legislature has heretofore granted all the interests of the State, present and prospective, in said lands. The me morial, with accompanying documents, was re ferred to the Committee on Public Lands, where the bill complained of originated. THE 

BOSTON BELIEF BILL encountered in the Senate Finance Committee the same opposition, which, the Chicago Belief bill met one year ago. The difficulty first arose from Senator Ferry’s opposition to the clause admitting lumber free of duty. On this point the Committee appeared to be equally divided, and the Chairman, Senator Sherman, agreed to report the bill with this provision stricken out. The second danse of disagreement arose on the clause allowing a drawback on materials for building purposes which shall be in bonded warehouse when the act goes into effect. This was also stricken out, and, with tho amend- the bill will probably now pass without opposition. EXCHANGING BONDS. In his last annual report the Secretary of tbe Treasury recommended the passage of an act ■which should empower the Treasury Depart ment to exchange coupons for registered bonds, where the holders should require it, and at the expense of the latter. A bill to this effect was reported from the Finance Committee to-day. but it met with the objection that it contained no limitation on the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the public debt in making these transfers. Under this objec tion the bill went over. Inasmuch is the Chair man of the Finance Committee indicates his willingness to have this suggestion incorporated as an amendment, the bill will doubtless be passed in this modified form. THE JAPAN INDEMNITY. Both the House Foreign Affairs and the Sen* ate Foreign Relations Committees appear to have agreed on the hill to release Japan from the payment of the $375,000 indemnity, accruing from the Convention of 1867, at Yokohama, -wherein the Japanese Government was the par ty of the one part and the Governments of the United States, and Great Britain, France, and Holland were the other. This money, it is hnderstood, has been subject to the draft of the Treasury Department for some time, but, there being no equitable claim, its release is asked for by our financial officials. INCREASED COamiSSIONS. The Committee of Ways and Means was in session, to-day, for the purpose of considering the proposition of the Secretary of the Treas ury to increase the commission for the negotia tion of the balance of the loan authorized by the funding act of 1870. The disposi tion of the majority of the members is unfavorable to the proposed increase, and it is more than probable that no measure will be reported unless it emanates from the minority, which will look to this end. In case any such bill should be reported, it stands a small chance of success in the House. INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL, The House was very dull and uninteresting to-day. A brief discussion arose on a bill to give land certificates to soldiers and their fami lies. The morning hour expired before a vote was taken, when the Indian Appropriation hill was presented by Hr. Sargent, who made quite a long speech on it. It was then read, and the House adjourned. The hill appropriates $5,379,- 365 against $6,362,062 for last year,—a saving of $932,697. ARKANSAS, Senator Rice will, to-morrow, introduce a reso lution demanding Congressional inquiry into the disorganized and threatening condition of affairs in Arkansas. The Senator is in dady receipt of facta which warrant him in making the demand. He will probably make a half hour’s speech upon the demoralized condition of society in that State. There is no truth in the report that Senator Rice has gone over to the Democracy, and attended their caucus. He occupies the same position, politically, ho did during the Canvass. COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY. The House Banking and Currency Committee, to-day, authorized Mr. Monroe to present, with a favorable report, his bill to prevent the # circula tion of counterfeit, altered, and spurious na tional bank notes. The hill is a useful one, and provides that any officer of a national bank, who may receive,. or to whom may he offered in busi ness, any counterfeit United States or national hank note, is authorized and required to write or stamp plainly upon the face of such note the word “counterfeit.” In the case of altered or spurious notes, these words shall in like manner be stamped on the note. LOCKING UP GREENBACKS. The Committee again brifly considered the caao of the Tenth National Bank of New York, which is charged with having aided Henry N. Smith ’in making a ‘‘comer” in greenbacks by locking up last winter §5,000,000 of that circula tion. A special Sub-Committee was appointed, consisting of Farwell, Hooper, and Randall, and from this fact it is thought that the investiga tion is to ho resumed with greater vigor than was last year shown* It is probable the Commit tee will he required to visit New York. THE CASE OF JUDGE J.AWAT. The House Committee on the Judiciary, at their meeting to-day, decided to order the print ing of the immense mass of testimony taken in the case of Judge Delohay, of Kansas, against whom charges of impeachment were made to the House about a year ago. A Sab-Committee was sent .to Kansas during the sommer to con tinue the investigation. It is expected the re port of the Committee will be made immediately upon the reassembling of the House after tho holiday recess. It is inferred from the fact that tho voluminous testimony has been ordered to be printed, that the inquiry is not at an end, for it is customary, as in the similar case of Judge Bosteed, when a case is to be dismissed by a Committee, for tho testimony to he filed with the Clerk and not printed, unless a different course has been adopted in this case. It seems probable that articles of impeachment will he presented to the House by the Committee on the 7th of January. The charges against him are drunkenness and dishonest practices. CONTESTED ELECTION. It is already known that there wifi be an ex traordinary number of contested election cases in the next House, and the Republicans have such a large majority in the next Congress, that it is thought there will be greater efforts on the part of the defeated candidates to secure seats than ever before. If they fall in obtaining seats they will have secured all they really hoped for, namely, mileage to and from "Wash ington, the expenses of the contest, and reason able allowances for the time spent. From pres ent indications, the number of cases will roach between twenty and thirty. cm niPSOVESIENTS. The House Appropriatioa Committee to-day decided unanimously to recommend the appro priation of $1,250,000 to reimburse the city for expenses incurred by the Board of Works in the improvement of Government buildings and res ervations. The item will be put into the Defi ciency bill, in order that it may be made availa ble as soon os possible, as the Board of Works ore in pressing need of money. Just now there is little doubt that the Senate will agree to the House resolutions to adjourn for the holidays from Dec. 20 to Jan. 6. The leading party Senators say there is no reason that the session should be prolonged, and that there is nothing to do but to pass the Appropri ation bills. NIAGARA SHIP CANAL. A prominent member of the Senate Commerce Committee said there needbe no anxiety in regard, to the Georgia and Niagara ship canals, as Congress would not touch them especial ly this season, notwithstanding the recommendations of the President’s message. He expressed, however, the belief that the Gov ernment ought to pay the expenses already in curred, and take possession of the Louisville and Portland Canal, and that the South St. Marie Canal should be added, which could be done at an expense of less than a hundred thousand dollars. A 

WHITE HOUSE CABPET. A new carpet of American manufacture, and costing $8 a yard* was to-day laid on the floor of the East Boom of the White House. The carpet removed from this magnificent saloon was the one presented to the United States by the Sultan of Turkey, and which was woven at the Imperial looms. It was very expensive and of beautiful texture, but of a very ugly pattern, and illy suited to the East Boom. The Turkish carpet has been relaid on the hall of the White House.

The Commission appointed to inspect the Min nesota Division of the Northern Pacific Railroad, prior to its acceptance by Government, to-day, made their report to the Secretary of the Interi or, substantially as follows s The section examined is found to he well located, both with reference to through and local traffic. Tho grades are light, three-fourths of the distance being below the average of thirty feet. The sharpest curve is three degrees, in a radius of 2,000 feet. Tho embankments and excar rations are' within tho requirements of law. The ballasting is well done with gravel. The rolling stock is uniformly of excellent qualify and in good condition, and amply sufficient for all present and near future require ments. The engine houses and repair shops aro deemed to he adequate. Mention is made of the emigrant houses at Brainerd, Clyndon, and Dnlnth, as being constructed with furniture and cooking utensils for the free -use of those in tending to settle on tho Company’s or Govern ment lands. The snow fences, water stations, and telegraph lines are considered ample for thelrpnrposes. The report closes as follows: tl Having found this portion of the road to bo judiciously located, well constructed, and ade quately equipped, and believing that it sub stantially meets tue requirements of both tho letter and spirit of the law and department reg ulations, the Commission recommend its ac ceptance by the Government, 0 The report covers a distance of 223 miles. 

DISBURSING OFFICERS. The Secretary of the Treasury sent a com munication to the House of Bepresentatives, ‘ to-day, recommending an amendment to the act to regulate and secure the safe-keeping of pub lic money intrusted to the disbursing officers of tho United States, passed in 1866. The Secre tary inclosed a draft of a bill, so as to include every cleri or agent with every disbursing offi cer, in a provision making it a penal offence to convert to bis own use, or to lend, with or without. interest, anv public moneys; and, also, making any Danker, or broker,or other person, who snail knowingly re ceive loans of public moneys from disbursing officers, liable to be tried for embezzlement. In the case of the United States against Hart well, the penal or latter clause of the third sec tion of the act of 1866 has been held by tho Su preme Court of the United States to be limited in its terms* to the officers named in the act. and cannot be construed to apply to any otners, hence the recommendation of the Secretary to include every clerk, agent, or other person. THE CASE OP LA3CAB. A bill has been passed in the House removing the political disabilities of S. Q. C. Lamar, of Mississippi. PERSONAL. The President and Mrs. Grant and Miss Nellie Grant left Washington on the noon train for Philadelphia, to attend the wedding of Miss Bo ris, niece of ex-Secretary Borio. The President will return to-morrow night. 

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS. The Supreme Court delivered the following decisions : In the case of Perham w. Way* from the Cir- T OIUU3S cuit Court of Indiana, judgment affirmed. The caao grew out of a suit by Parham to make the suretiea.on a Marshal's bond liable for false re turn, in which it was decided the Marshal was liable. In the case of Croy, from the East District of Pennsylvania, tho Court n-ffirma the judgment' below, that the sum realized by the advance in value of Government bonds held bytheparty de fendant, was not subject to tax as gains. In the case- of the United States vs. Surger and others, from the Illinois Circuit Court, the Court decided that distillers may bo taxed for a quantity of spirits equal to SO’per cent of tho producing capacity of their distilleries, whether the amount actually manufactured equals that quantify or not. A short Cabinet meeting was held to-day, he*- fore noon, but nothing of imucnal importance was considered. APPROPRIATION BILLS. The number of tho several Appropriation billa is fourteen. Three are already before the House, and three more will be reported before the holi day recess. ON A FOREIGN MISSION. John T. Croxton, of Kentucky, has been ap pointed Minister resident to Bolivia. Washington, Dec. 10.—Mr. TRUMBULL pre sented the memorial of citizens of Minnesota against tho passing of a bill to perfect the navi gation of the Mississippi. Mr. 

COOPER presented the memorial of the Southern Methodist Association of Tennessee, asking payment for the destruction of their property during the war. Mr. SHEBMAN, from the Finance Committee, reported the bill of Mr. Pomeroy prohibiting the B£de of liquors in the District of Columbia, and moved to refer the subject to the Judiciary Committee. The Finance Committee was in favor of a law imposing a penalty for the benefit of the wives or creditors of drunkards upon those who sold them liquor, but thought it rath er a question of morals than finances. Mr. POMEROY said the Judiciary Committee was not a committee on morals. * Mr. SHEBMAN—“Not exactly; but it is a committee on laws.” Mr. CONKLXNG opposed the reference to the Judiciary Committee, and asked whether the question did not belong to the Finance Commit tee.
