'"The place cbeon for (he injection after several trials of other places was the skin of the buck bet ween t lie shoulder blades and tha lumbar region, liocaune Mere the injection led to the least local resctiou, generally none stall, and ws almcist pititiloM. As regards tho edicts of the remedy on the human jwtieut, It was dear from Ulie beginning of the re search that iu one very important parlh'ular the hamaa being reacts to the rewody oiaer ontly from Uie auimal sewerallj' ased iu ox ei intents, namdy, the puiHca-pJc. A new iroof for the eKjicriimniter of the all-importaiit aw that experiment on aatuiak ie net conclu sive, for tihe human patient proved extraordi narily more facusitive than the guiuon-pig. "Although the onset of the remedy ia equal doses is vory dinonwt in animals aud in humau beings, if calculated by body weight, in some other respeots there is much Httuilarily iu tha symptoms produced, tlte most imHrtaut of those resemblances beinp the specific action of tits remedy ou tho tulicrcuious process, tbo varieties of which I will not here describe. I will make no further lefereuee to its uifocts on animals, hut I will at ones turn to its extraor dinary action on tuhorcttlosik in human boiiips. Tho healthy human being reacts either not at all, or locaroely at all, as wo have seen, when 0 01 cubic contiuiftter is M'ed. The same holds good with regard te MitieMts fluttering front diseases other thau tahereuloMs, as ropcatod OKnerimouts huve proved ; bsi thu case is very diner out whuii the iIhuuho is faArrceoiSc. A dose of 0.01 cubic centimeter injetted subcu taueoualy into tuheu-ulous patiuuts causes u soveru Konerai reaction ait well ae a local one. " I ftave children, afjed from two to six years, one-tenth of this dose that is te my, 0.001 cubic centimeter vory delicate children only 0.0005 cubic centimeter, and obtained power ful, but in no way dangerous, reaction. The general reaction constate iu an attack of fever, whioh usually begins with rigor, aud rises the totuperatHro above Htt, often up te 40, and even 4lC. This is accouipaiied by pain in titie 1 1 in lis, couching, great fatigue and often sickness and vomiting In several cases a sitxht ictet'oid discoloration was observed, aud occasionally an orunliou like raraides on tho oheat Hud neck. The attack usually begins four to five hours after (ha injection, and lasts from IS te 15 hours. Occasionally it begius later aud thou runs its course with less intensity. ' Tho patients are very liuhj aitbcled by the attack, and as mmm as it k over feel compara tively well, generally bettot than bofore. Tho looal reactiou (a bo best observed in cases in which the tuberculous affoction is visible; (or instance, in cases of Input, changes take place which show the t-pecific anti-tuberculous action of the remedy to a most surprising degree. A few hours after an injection into the k in of the latch that is, in a spot far removod from tho diseased area on the face or elsewhere the lupus bogins ton well sad to redden, and this it does generally before the initial rigor. During the fever the swelling aud redness increase, nod niay finally roach a high degree, so that the lupus tissue becomes brow uinh aud necrotic iu places whore the growth was sharply defined. We sometimes fouud a much swollen and brownish spot surrvundod by a whitish edge almost one centiuu-ier wide, which again was surrounded by a broad baud of bright red. "After the subsidence of the fever the swell ing of the lupus tissue gradually decreases and disapiwars in about two or three days. The lupus spots themselves are then oovcred by a soft deposit which filters outward aud dries iu the air. The growth then changes te a crust, which falls ofl' after twe or three weeks, ami which sometimes utter only one iujecUou leaves a clean, red cicatrix behind. Generally, however, several injections are required for the complete removal of the lupus Ussue: hut of this, more later ou. J must meutiou asa iiofnt ef aped at importance that the changes described &r cKiioUy ooufiuod to the parts of the skin affected with iu pes. Kven tboBcnalletft nodules, and those most deeply hidden in the lupus tisues, ge through the process aud booome visible in oonsoQueuoe ef the swelling and change of color, whilst Uie UShue itself in which Urn lupus changes have entirely ce.ed remained un changed. The observation of a lupus case treated by the remedy is so iustrnctive, and is necessarily so couvinoing, that those who wish to infcke a trial ef the romody should. If possi ble, begin with a ease of lupus. (It should be remembered that lupus ia now oonsidorod by pathologists te be tuber ouloek of the akin.) "Tho notion of tlte remedy in oases of phthisis generally showed itsotf as follows: Couch aud expectoration were generally in creased a little after the first injection, thou grew less aud le, and in the most favorable casos entirely disappeared. " Tlte most important point to be observed in the new. treatment k its oaily application. The proper su jucts for treatment are patients iu the initial stage of pfatiikis, for iu thorn the eurvtive action can be most fully hIiown, and for this roason, toe, it cannot be toe seriously jwfnted out that practitioners must Sa the future be more tbaa over alivs to the import ance of diagnosing phthisis in as early a stuge as possible. Up to t be present time tbo proof of tubercle bacilli in the epututn was con sidered more as aa interesting point of seoon dary importance, which, though it made diag nosus more certain, cos id not help the patient in any way, aud which, in ooiisequonoe, was often itogluctad. "Thk I have lately refieatedly had occasion to observe ia numerous cases of phthisis which had geuorally gene through the hands of (sev eral doctors without auy examination of tbo aputum having boca made. Jn the future this muni he changed. A doctor who shall neglect to diagnose phthisis iu its earliest stago by all methods at his command, ospocially by exam ining the sputum, will be guilty of tbo most serious neglect of hk patient whose life may depend uou the early application of tbe specific treatment In cousequencu, in doubt ful oaaee, medical practiouors must make sure of the presence or absence of lulterculoeia, and then ouly will the new tberajteutic method be oeme a blessing to suffering humanity, when all casos of tuberculosis are treated iu their earliest stage aud ws no longer meet with nog looted serious esses forming aa inextiugukb able sou roe of fresh infoctions.H Prom the foregoing atntemonts of Prof. Koch his claims, it will be seen, fall very far abort of what has beon attributed to him in various publications, and yet they arc eufli otont to create an entire change in the troat mont of consumptive patients iu the early fltagos. It mast be manifest to any one that it k entirely useless to expect that the in jection of any chemical substance whatever will reproduce lung structures that have beon thrown off during the progress of tho dkoase, or to euro patients that are affected with large oavittes. It k in tho beginning of the disease that the greatest advantage will be roaped from the application of tbo new remedy. That Prof, Koah doea not choose to distribute it promiscuously, or to publkh te the world hk formula of prepara tion! to quite as much an evidence that he has not forgotten the llrewn-Sequard fail ure as it to of his wisdom. The prepara tion of this remedy is necessarily one that requires the highest degree of skill in bacteriology, and while hundreds of medi cal men are theoretically onliroly acquainted with haotoriology, tho number that are praotioally familiar with it is very limited. Thofuture alone will demonstrate how much hope may he oxtondod to Buffering humnn Ity from the Koch remedy. In tbe mean time it to suggested that we patiently await further developments. I have Enid enough to show the reason why most medical men of this country give credence to tbe an nouncements of Prof. Koch, and what they hope from thk new Consumption Cure. lit 

CONGRESS. Monday, Dnc. 1. Thore was an unusually largo nttendauco of Senators at tho opouiug of Congress, and ninny desks wore covered with flowors. Tbo desk of Sons tor Voorbees Iud.) was covered with a rooster made out of grassos, feathers and flowers. Other Senators' desks were covered with hand some designs in flowers. Precisely at noon Vice-President Morton called tho Sen a to to order, aud after prayor the credentials of tho two new Senators from Wyo ming (Messrs. Carey aud Warren) were road, aud they drew lots as to who should fill tbe leng and slioit terms. Senator Carey drow tho long term, and they were then sworn.

ABOUT BIG BOWLDERS. A LIttIo Geological Talk of General Interest Some Hocking Stones. St. NicheJtiB. Whonevor tho glacior molted, thoy left an immense amount of ''drift" that is, sand, gravel, and steiios of all sorts, which had been frosen in the ice whou the glaciers woro form ing. The stones of th is drift arc of all sizes. Somo are as small as pebMes, others as largo as small houses. Tin re u one at Bradford Mass., which measures 3U feet each way and weighs 4,500,kkj pounds. There is another on a ledgo in Vrimnnt which is cvon larger than that, and which m nst have boen carried by tbe ice across a valley lying 500 feet below wbero tho stone now is, shewing that the ice wasftOO feet thick. Great ltowlders of trait-rock extend through Connecticut on a line running to Long Island Sound ; and as some of the same kind are found in Loug Island, the glacier is bclicvod to bavo crossed the sound, carrying these rocks with it An immense statue of Peter tbe Great, in St. Pel rsburg, stands ou these glacier bowldora of solid granite which weighs 3,000,000 pounds. One of tho largest bowldors iu America is in the Indian village of Mohegan, near Montvillo, Coon. Tho Indians call the rock " Shedegan." Its top, which is fiat and largo as tho floor of a good -i nod room, is reached by a ladder. Sometimes these bowlders aro fouud perched upon bare ledges of rock, so nicely balanced that, though of great weight thoy may bo rocked by hand. They aro called " rocking stones." Kear the littlo Connecticut village of Koauk, on Long Island Sound, there is an im mense bowlder, called by the pooplo there "Jomimy's Pulpit." Jt was formerly n roek-ing-stono. Hut tho rock has worn away below it and it can no longer be moved. Poaoc Meeting In Sajhraek (Conn.) In 1501 Lymt (0Hn.) Sound Ilrceie. Some lime since a request came from Knnsas for particulars concerning a Poaco mooting held at Sayhrook in the Summer of 1861. Mr. Wm. li. 'looker, of Uocavillc, kindly furnishes us with remembrances of tbe occasion. During this Summer (1861), Bridgeport had a rousing Peace meeting, and it uns a livoly time all around. It created great excitement all ovor tbe State, wheu tho Sayhrook meeting was an nounced and extensively advertised ; pooplo naturally looked for a scrimmage, and a largo crowd collected to soo that all went right. Henry Lord, Charles Martin, William Brock way, and our writer, Mr. Tooker, natives ot Hamburg, wont to Lyme in a sail-boat; tho landlord of tbo Bacon House loaned thorn a large U. S. ensign aud accompanied the party to ijaybrook; this party was added toas llto.trip from the river to Haybiook continued. A long maple pole was cut and the ons.gn fas toned to it; tbo tallest of the party was chosen color bear or and carried tbo flag. They marched to tho flagstaff iu Sayhrook which was to float the peace flag, attached their ensign aud hoist ed away, but alas, when tbo old gridiron reached tbe truck it camo fluttering to the g rue nd, halliards and all, some greeny having f6Lcudod the halliards with a granny kuot which pulled out with the above result. Then came the tug of war. The peaceites seized one end of tha halliard aud the m a rites the other. The warites dually obtained possession of halliard, flag, and the field. One man was knocked down and somewhat bruised; bo was true blue though, and was soon on dock again ; his name was Osmer Panuolco und resided in Essex. The pescoites tbroatenod to shoot anyono who attempted to replace the halliards. Our writer, Mr. Tooker, being, as he expresses it, somewhat thick hided as well as thick headed, took chances aud went up tbo pole. Upon reach ing the cross-tioes it was found that the topmast was too weak to bear the woight of Air. Tooker, aud volunteers among the boys were called for, one brave little fellow did the act; he shinned the topmast, rovo the halliard and slid grace fully to the ground. His namo cannot bo re called, but his ago was under 1-1 years, and I would be pleased to learn the name of tbo boy. Our Joe (Senator Hawley) was at the meeting, and a horse was taken from a convenient wagon aud Senator Hawley, jumping into the wagon, was hauled to the flsg sUtl' by tbe warites amid deafening cheers; hero he made a rousing speech. There were no Peace flags floatod that day, neither were there auy Peace spcochos. Wm. Brock way, now a rcsidout of Kansas, served in Uie 10th Conn., aud was wounded at Roanoke Island. Mr. Tooker served four years Iu the 13th Coim., and now rosidos at Uncus ville, whether Mr. Martin sorvod in tho late war or not, 1 am unablo to say. " Ilheer Ihland' Veterans. Jitotfon Jcrad. If yon meet ox-Gov. Lsdd, of Bhodo Island, ask him how bo turned tbo laugh on n group of distinguished people amid whom ho sat in the presidential grand stand at tbo Grand Army display. Everybody who is on speaking terms with him know) that bo is as proud of bis little Stale as though it was as big as Texas, aud the chatting to which ho was subjected whilo tho thousands of men in tbo Departments from the great Slates were marching past was not calcu lated to make h.iu particularly comfortable. " Don't forget your spyglasses when Littlo Rhody's Department is duo," cautioned Gov. Butleigh. "I say, Ladd, don't you want to borrow n man to carry a flag for your boys?" shouted Gov. Bulkier over tbo bonds of rows of people. " Is it possible that Kbodo Island has u Depart, meat by Itself V" provokiugly queried Mrs. Alger. And so it went for a conplo of hours. Fi nally, Littlo Khody's Department flag was des cried turning into lluutinglou avenue. Then oamo Uie Department Commander proudly riding ahead of a staff as numerous as the largest. Then came Reeves's eploudid band, and then platoon after platoon aud Post aftor Post of splendidly-equipped vetorans.

Collins said that Dr. A. A. Miner would be a vory good man If be would only let rum alone. Dr. Minor Is ordinarily a very genial, magnetic preach or, but bo doesn't often say auytbing in tbo pulpit in which thore is not somo more or lo&s forceful roforonce to what ho calls " liquid damnation." In tho pulpit he Is a picturesque figure, tall and rather thin, with a long, gray beard that sweep his breast He possesses a rich vein of dry, caustic wit, that makes him vory effective as a speaker. 7r LIES NAILED, No Basis for Exaggerations of Soldier Hating!

INDIAN OUTBREAK. So Trouble Anticipated by the Military Anthorl Ilii. During tho past week tbo Indians bavo con tinued to danco and work thomsclves into frenzy, but tbo military authorities bavo en vironed tho disaffected savages so thoroughly that an outbreak is not feared. Gen. Miles has almost surrounded the different sRcncics with troops, which aro so placed that tho liuo in any part of it can lo cosily reinforced from any point, and the Indians who aro the ringloadcrs of tbo revolt are perfectly awaro of those con ditions, so it is safe to say that thoy will bo vory careful regarding their future movements. Gon. Miles has been in Washington talking over tbo situation with tho President, tbo Sec retary of War, Sccrolary Noble and Gen. Scho field, and left for Chicago on Monday, Dec. 1. Ho has full instructions as to tbo courso to pur sue, and he will go at ouco to tbo sccno of tho disturbance if advices requiro his presunco after bo roaches his headquarters in Chicago. It is said that the ghost dances are to be im mediately stopped, the Indians indulging in them aro to bo both disarmed aud dismounted, and that those who are prominent iu tho dis turbance are to be taken and placed iu confine ment. If this plan is carried out thoro is littlo doubt but that ono of tbo greatest uprisings of tho plain Indians will bo shortlived. Tho mili tary authorities chum that they aro in complolo control of the situation, and will mako short work of the ghost dancers if they make tho least break. Surjr.-Gtn. Baxter Taraljied. While going from his ofilco to his home on Monday ovening, Dec. 1, Surg.-Gen. J. H. Bax tor, U. S. Army, was strieken with paralysis on New York avonuo. Ho sank to the pavemont and immediately became unconscious. Ho was taken into a bouso aud 'received medical aid, aud was thon removed to his homo. His con dition was found to bo exceedingly critical, and it was thought that bo could not recover. Gon. Baxter was recently appointed Surgeon-General of the Army, has been a vory active man all his life, was a tnoderato liver, and had never boforo had any premonition of paralysis. Unfarorable Sjrniptomsln AdwJral Porter's Cane. Admiral D. D. Porter has boon ill for Bevoral months, and no hopes aro now entertained of his ullimato recovery. Ho has bad a complica tion of diseases, although the bronchial trouble aud tbo swelling of tbe limbs have disappeared. Ho cannot now leave his room, and it is not likoly that ho over will leave it alivo. Ono of his sons is constantly in attendance upon him. Tho Admiral was a powerful man both mentally and physically wheu in bis prime, and bo does not yield readily to disease, but bis advanced ago renders it diflicult for him to recover from tho recent attack. A Soldier' Men or "Fun." IH'wl Ckrtter IUerd. Wo have heard different versions of what constituted fun, but wo beard a new ono tho other day from an old soldier. At Gettysburg about tbo time of Pickolt's charge the relator was stationed down toward tbe odgo of tho Whoatfleld, and ho was sent ont with a squad to rcliovo tho picket in acopeeof woods. Meet ing tho Sergeant ho was about to relieve, ho asked him what his orders wore. Ho was In formed, and among other things tho pickets wore not to Are. " Why," said tho relieving Ser geant " they are firing right now. Why don't you stop them?" "Oh, wo! I, thoy aro just having a littlo fun In there. Tho rebels havo got possossion of a stretch of stono wall and our boys swear they aro going to take it away from them." Our informant went iu, and soon he aud his men wore as deep iu tho "fun" us their prodocassors, notwithstanding their or ders not to Are. They kept it up, dodging behind trees and working aronnd tho woods until they got a flank flro, ran in ou tbo stono wall, and captured it. Thoy had their fun aud accomplished their object.
