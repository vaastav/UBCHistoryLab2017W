Democrat eny that "thcie are troop enough at Fort Moultrie Uic ' commandant neither taking nor a-unting any more." Vrnj how man; does the Democrat consid er "enough" to guard a fort in an eneraj' country ? Accordiu; to the luut accurate account, Col. Anderson lias only ixty or evenly men, and ia poorly supplied with munition ot war. The C. S. Arsenal at Charleston U in tbe possession of the eces sionisM, and a gentleman direct from Charlt- ton reports at Wishingt-oa that Col. Andersen iu refused the privilege of Hindioj to tbe arsenal for luppliea, and hi officers weie seut back without them, because percussion cap were sect for, and a guard was subse quently placed about the arsenal. Docs this look as if the commandant would neither atk fuf, nor need any more? Agata we are informed by telegraph that on reception at Charleston of a report that steamer with 600 soldiers for the defence of Fort Moultrie was on iu way from New York, tbe citizens rushed in arms to the docks, de termined to preveut their lauding. We sup pose this is another proof tuat "there are troops enough at Fort Moultrie." It ia re ported further that the rumor is prevalent that Buchanan has actually advised Col. An derson to vacate the Fort, and thus ignomin- iously abandon the post to the rebellious secessionists, but this report we are loth to believe. It is perfectly apparent to the Democrat, and to every one else, that Fort Moultrie is not sufficiently guarded, and that the Presi dent is inviting the danger which haugs over it. Were the fort in any other locality be side the South; were it ir. UtH.li, Kansas, or Central America, the w no e Democratic press would strenuously urge a garrison of five hundred men lor its protection, bur, be ing in the way of Southern revolution, they are eager to have it fall. England and America. The Democratic-Disunion press have en deavored to impress their reader with the belief that England and the European pow ers were rejoicing at the prospect of the dis solution of the Union, and that England would hail with pleasure the establishment of Southern Cotton Confederacy, with which f he would hasten to form an alliance, offen sive and defensive, the ground work of her upport lying in her commercial interests. The National Democrat of Nov. 21st, assert ed that "for years England has labored, in directly, but not tbe less surely, to bring about the state of affairs now culminating not because ot any real dislike she has to our form of Government, but because the United States is her great rival in commercial su premacy, and with the cIon ot the world in ber hands, must beat her iu manufactories. The monopoly of the cotton secured to ber, and willingly would she see the slave-trade re-cpened willingly would she wage a war in its defense for with that, England would etand confessed the first of commercial as she would be the first of manufacturing nations." The barometer to a nation's sentiment and interests is her publicpress,un!ess,a3 is not the case In Eagland--that press is trammeled by slavish lubserviency to cliques and powers. Let as see how the English press speaks up on I he political troubles in tbe United States, and how it bears the insult so often repeated, that England would eit aside all her hos tility to slavery, if by so doing, she could put money in her treasury 1 and power in her hands. The London Times of Nov. 21st (the very same day rpon which the National Democrat published the above assertion,) af ter saying that "a man may have opinions adverse to Slavery, and a man may reside in a slave State, but he cannot do both these things at once ;" adds, "We are glad to think that tbe march of slavery, and the domineering tone which it advocates were beginning to assume over Freedom, have been at length arrested and silenced. We rejoice that a vast community of onr own race has at length given an au thoritative expression to sentiment which are entertained by every one in this country. We trust to see the American Government employed in task more worthy of a State founded on the doctrines ofliberty and equal ity than the invention of shifut and devices to perpetuate servitude; and we hear in this great protest of American freedom the tardy echo of those humane doctrines to which Pixalanil Kaaa a A lnnrv VtwtsOTtk am winrnrt IVilgllUlU kiOJ BV 1VU WlAiWU vtU 11 la. Not a word of exultation or of the prospec tive advantages which England will reap, but tbe same characteristic tone of opposition to human slavery which has ever been tbe Eng lishman' boast. The London Herald of Nov. 20th says : "May be wtvill thortly have to look to oth er tourcet for our cotton and other Souther product, and it is to be hoped Her Majesty's government, ia view of the precarious condi tion of American affairs, will devote its im mediate attention to our much neglected West Indian and other colonies, so as to enable our planters to supply the deficiency. The London News, of Nov. 22d, having re viewed the position of the country, "at the momenta of it going over from a corrupt to a regenerate republican system," says: "One more evil may be impending the fail ure of the cotton tuppiy. It need not be so if the planters were wise ; but they are in this matter, not wise. We can only bear in mind that a tervile tear tooidd have been tvorte fur the eo tUn crop than a fanciful political ogitation, and meantime,for our oim rart, make kattt to create olhir tourcet of supply. We shall have th9 nation on our side in op position to the siave trade, and iu our endeav ors to make industrial aliies of the inhabitant of Africa. Spain must then give way about her Cuba slave trade. In. America, free l.-v-bor will presently supersede the more extrav agant method of production, and the antag onism of race will be much softened. The London Post, of Nov. 23d, soys: "To all abearance, American intlitutient are about to be tried by a teverer tett than hat ever yet been applied to them, and tre need hardly ' tag thai a civil var between the. North and Soath would, at the pretrnt time, prove highly mju riout to the came of political freedom through out the world. Vt e trust that American states men of all politics will n3e their utmost ef forts to prevent so f-rc i -v calamity," We hive here the view s of four of the lead ing English jonrnals, not one of which utters any sentiments save those of sympathy with the efforts to deliver the country from the do minion of tiaveryMa sot the Southerner-! count cpon tie assiikaacf o; England in tbetr treasonable schemes, elua they will jfind their For the Leader. No Compromise. A vsgua and startling Impression hag ta ken firm hold ot a portion of the public mind that soma sort of humiliating, disgraceful compromise or flx-up ii about being elimina ted by the politician of tMt hot-bed of cor ruption" the' National Capita! to appease the wrath of South Carolina and the South generally.' Caa It be possible that there i to betuch a collapse of ih great principle, upon which this great battle has been so brave ly fought and wen in the triumphant election of Lincoln and Hamlin T We cannot be believe that any politician from tbe Eait or the Great West will do so, and thus knock a hole in the noble Republican ship, sinking the hopes of the million of American cili- sens who have so long labored and grayed for the glorious consummation, now for the first time attained in the history of our gov- eminent. Never befote in our political con tst was an issue more definitely made up, Tbe most experienced and skillful pleader in our court of justice could not hare brought out the point of difference upon which the case wenttotheAnerican people, better than did the Chicago Convention. Upon this issue, thusjmade up, the question was discussed upon every stump at the North and South, when Lynch law did sot Intervene to prevent it. Upon this plain issue the Press fought the battle, ' It is not pretended (hat there has been any misapprehension on the part of the people. But it is said the South will not sub mit to this long sought, long labored for.Jver diet ot the honest heart and noble manhood of a people determined to be free a people willing however to wait as tbey cave done, for the grand result to be brought about by the legitimate Use of constitutional machine ry. Now that this mult is all but reached, here is the traitor that will dare try and wrench from the freemen ot this nation, at the demand and under the treasonable threats of the oligarchy, tbe fliigof victory. It seems impossible that -such a woe should come; but we have not forgotten tbe compromise of 50, nor the most recent and more daring and desperate repeal of the Missouri compromise una. and tbe still later attempt to torce sla very into Kansas. 1 It may come, but woe to tbe man or men by whom such a woe comes! Let any member of Congress from Ohio favor any compromise or hx-up and his , political Undertaker will have his remains in charge immediately. lie had better never been born. A mill stone around the neck of such a trait or would not hasten his fate. Burr whs no more surely doomed than is that Ohio Repub lican who dares to trifle with the solemn ver dict of the people on this great matter ot Hu man Rights. What Webster did to quiet and appease the South in 1850, was indeed God like, when compared with the treason new contemplated; yet what he did in the way of compromife cost him, not only uis political, but national lite. Thank God, the people, and not the politicians, have come to judgment, and are about settling the boundaries of this great question., Hellish Southern Outrage. L ist evening's Plain Dealer contains a let ter from a correspondent in Memphis, Tenn., ia which, in an unfeeling manner, he de tailed the most savage act of cowardly cruel ty ever committed by any community on the lace of the earth, the barreling up ot a cit izen of Ohio, and rolling bim into the Mis sissippi I Can it be possible that such heath enish worse than heathenish cruelty ia be ing practiced in this professed Christian land? But read the extracts which we publish below. It will be borne in mind that this account is written by a pro-slavery man to a pro-slavery paper, consequently it cannot be charged that the story is a Republican invention. MEMPHIS, Nov. 6, 1860. Daaa Gaxr : I buve been TOTS few aayi n this city, and am much pleased with the state of affairs. They have a Vigilance Com mittee as a consequence of the (taction of Lin coln, and this committee are vigilant in ma king Northerners hie their homes, i An an instance of the intensity of feeliug here, against the Northern abolition emmissaries, tbey took an Ohioan, a few davs since, at the po nt just below tbe city, and being satisfied that he was "one of 'em," after consultation, they put him in a barrel, headed him up, and rolled the barrel down the bluff into the Mis sissippi river, and that was the last ot bim. The Arkansas people oppo site here have fired into several ot the Cin cinnati steamers which have attempted to land, and will not allow Ohio boat to land at all Last week a Cincinnati merchant took $15,- OuO and went to New Oi leans to purchase su gar and molasses, but could not purchase a dollar's worth and was ordered to leave tbe city in five hours. He secreted himself in the bouse of a friend and got his friend guardedly to do the purchasing and shipping for him. He then left in the night by tbe express train for the North. AH along tbe river strangers are asked where they are from, and if they say "North," they are ordered forthwith to leave. The Cincinnati Commercial publishes an account of tbe same tragedy, and gives a col umn article in denunciation of the outrage. If our people are being thus tortured and mur dered by such a remorseless race of savages a now exist in some localities of tbe South, it is high time that steps be taken by the Gov ernor and Legislature of Ohio to protect it citizens. Tbe cruelties of the Southern mobs equal those of the Roman Catholic Inquisition. Another Veteran. John Henington, living in Augusts town hip, Carroll countj, Ohio, who will be 102 years old on the firtt day ot January next, voted for Lincoln at the late election. In 1817 be settled on tbe farm which he still own. He b s. always enjoyed good health until recently. The effect of hi extreme old age are now beginning to bear upn him. Gov. Seward's Criticism. Gov. Seward ha the credit of the most pungent and concentrated criticism made on the President' Message. He is reported to have said that thePresident has established two- things that a State may not, secede, unless it wants to; and, in case of secession, It would become the duty of the Executive to enforce the laws if nobody objected. fm-j- Outwitting the Enemy by a Flank Movement. u The Washington correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial say 'anew scheme il talked of by which a flank movement will astonish tbe Southern Confederacy. .' A prominent Republican member astonish ed Southern gentlemen by intimating that when the South moves in the march of dis solution, tbe Republicans, after Lincoln is inaugurated, will acquire Mexico by treaty and, flank the Southern confederacy by-' free State. i , 10 We would call attention to a commu nication in another column, headed "No Compromise." It was written and prepared by two of our most prominent and leading Republicans. Diath of an Old Parma.

A gentleman of Chicago, direct from New Orleans,- furnishes the Tribune with sou sketches ol political feeling in that city, from which w triike several extract: THE 

FURY OF THE SOUTH. Tbey are for Instant and unconditional dis solution of the Union, at any price, and at all huzard. They want no compromises, no concession, no bargains, no ameudmenU of the Constitution. They are for a Southern Confederacy nothing leas. There is, he tell us, a conservative class, but they are borne along with the crowd, and dare not yet lift a voice in remonstane against the extreme measures upon which tbe populace are bent; nor do they hope that anything like reason will again rule the hour until some fatal act is committed which will sei rale the Cotton States from the Union, . the into war. NO SAFETY FOR NORTHERN MEN. Of course, in the midst of excitement like that which reigns in New Orleans, no North ern man, unless uu fie to bis principles, or uuder the protection of powerful friends, is safe. To be suspected of Republicanism is the signal tor a warning; to be convicted of it, is to be driven off. The moveable police torce istne mob under tbe name ot vigilant commitiees, and these the better class of cit izens are powerless to restrain. There is iu tact throughout all the Cotton States an un disguised Reign of Terror. ST. CHARLES HOTEL. The St. Charles Hotel is the center of the excitement. That house is the common re sort of the most violeut ot the fanatics, who between tbeir cups and their cursings amuse themselves with hunting up, insulting and driving off Northern men because they are Northern men. When our friend left tbe city, the ruffians had made a clean sweep; and that caravan sery was without a resident of any of tbe free Sta es within its walls. They had all been compelled to leave some to quit the ' city and their business, others to look np more decent quarters where violence and ruffianism are not the rule. 

ASSASSINATION PUND. One evening, in tbe reading-room of that establishment, the crowd was assembled as usual, and as usual the Abolitionists were the theme. Becoming excited, one man said to be wealthy and influential, pulled out his pocket-book and said, "Here axe $3,000 which I will subscribe to a fund to procure the assas sination of Lincoln and Hamlin. Who'll swell the pile?" In ten minutes, or less, more than $40,000 had been offered for this infamous purpose, and the names of tbe sub scribers were tuken down. The witness of this transaction is far from believing that this was mere gasconade. NARROW ESCAPE FOR PROF. MITCHELL. the escape of Professor Mitchell, the well known Astronomer of Cincinnati. He was on the cars going South, and when near Jack son, Miss., a man somewhat inflamed with liquor, but more with pro-slavery hate, en tered into conversation with him on political subjects. The Professor was cautious and reserved ; but venturing to say that he thought Mr. Lincoln was a conservative man and would not do injustice to tbe South, his pro-slavery friend was greatly incensed; and when the train halted at Jackson, jumped to the platform and shouted to the crowd about the station, "there a a d ned abolitionist on the train 1 Lynch him I Lynch him 1" Instantly, at least fifty men jumped on and commenced a search for the offensive speci men of Northern opinion; but before the Professor could be pointed out, the conductor, seeing the danger, pulled bis bell cord and tbe cars moved off, and with them the Pro fessor with a whole skin. From the Hopkinsville (Ey.,) Mercury Extra. From the Hopkinsville (Ey.,) Mercury Extra. The Conflagration at Hopkinsville--The Lunatic Asylum Burned---One Life Lost. our occur rence of the greatest conflagration that ever took place in this part of the State. ! The Western Lunatic Asyum, the li-rgest and most costly building in Kentucky, look fire on Friday morning, at 11 o'clock, and in tbe course of four hours was totally destroyed, with the exception of the walls. Tr.e fire was first een in the roof in the rear of tbe anaa w mft, anjitma"n;tMgti-wliAl waj Ulcrwlng from the northwest at the time, the dry shin gles were soon In a Same that defied a 1 effort of subjection. The vast halls created a dralt like the blast of a furnace, and in a short time the immense edifice, which we had ught might stand as an everlasting mouu- nient to it builders, was wrapped from tower to foundation in one sheet of livid, crack ling, and roaring flame, that swept along with the fury of a tornado. . Dr. Montgomery, tbe superintendent, lost everything in bis great efforts to save his pa- pnta. Tue assistant suffered in like manner, -n reaching the yardsome fifty of the patients fed panic-stricken to the woods. Parties are n the woods searching for them and are fast ringing them in. On repairing to the spot it three o'clock, we found the road, extend d some two mile from tbe Court ' House, thronged with citizens visiting and retnrning ;rom the scene of the disaster. Tbe splendid structure was tb pride of our people, and all were shocked at its swift destruction. The attendant succeeded in saving tbe pa tients, gome two hundred and fifty, without iniury, except one who fastened his cell, near where the tire originated. The attendant; after endangering his own life, had to leave him. The procession. of lunatics, marching into town, presented a spectacle of melancholy grotesqueness; as the poor creatures passed on, the men on foot and the lemales in wag ons and hacks, wrapped op in quilts, blank its and comforts of every hue. . Some ot them seemed passive and indifferent ; some seemed unusually elated, whilst others wore in their faces a vague impression that some heavy misfortune had befallen them. Tbe county and town authorities bave made tem porary quarters for them in the Court House and other buildings, which will be made as comfortable a possible. We learn that the patient burned up was Stewart, a carpenter. Most of tbe wall are without a fissure, and seem a good as ever; but th mistaken econ omy of the State in not providing a metal roof, has cost ber aany thousand of dollars. Tbe building cost over $200,000. : Another Pionisr Gok. --We are called upon to-day to chronicle the death of Heze kiah Stiles, an old and much esteemed citizen of this county. He died at his residence, in Columbia, not far from the spot of his birth. His uncle, Majar Benjamin Stiles, it was who induced Symmes to make tbe purchase be tween the two Miamis, and the deoeased's failier and ondes were among tbe first to pettle, tnereon. For, thirty years Hezekiah Stiles has occupied an important place in tbe community, and bis death -will be felt and beard with regret in many households. Cin. Timet.' '- ": - '- -- - :. Planters Houmxo Cottos. New Orleans advices of the 5th state that it is now ascer tained that the planters have resolved to bold on to tbeir cotton, aud the sudden full ing off in the receipts at the ports, amounting to nearly one-half, is ample confirmation of .the Cct..:", The' reason assigned by their plan ters for their course i th severe depression that exists In the Atlantic and Gulf markets, and the suspension of the banks of Georgia, South i Carolina and other States, through which their exchanges are done. It is thought that this action of the planters will have a tendency to arrest any further downward movement of the staple. The decline already submitted to on the balance of the crop, esti mating the whole crop at 4,000,000 bales, amounts in round figures to about fifteen mil lions of dollars. j Union Meeting in New Jersey.
