WASHINGTON LETTER. fSPEIAL COREB8PONDESCB OF THE MONITOR. Washington, Nov. 29. IS 97. Republican conferences are the or der of the day, as Senators and Repre sentatives arrive in Washington. President McKinley, having finished his annual message to Congress and got it into the hands of the printers, is devoting a considering portion of his time to conferring with prominent members of the party as to the legis lation of the session. He is particu larly anxious that whatever party measures are brought before Congress shall have the united support of re publicans, and he is losing no oppor tunity to impress that idea upon those with whom he talks. While not ex pecting that all his recommendations, financial or otherwise, will be favor ably acted upon by Congress, he be lieves that by good management, some of them can be put .through. There are reasons for the belief that a sufficient number of Senators will under certain circumstances vote with the republicans in the Senate to pass several bills that will greatly strengthen the administration and benefit the country. It is not deemed expedient to specify these measures at this time, but just wait and see if the President does not justify his rep-' utation as a harmonizcr. It is refreshing after reading the numerous jingo schemes advanced just now to find the following sensible, language in tha annual report of the Secretary of the navy: "Additions to our fleet may be hereafter necessary to bring it up, in case of an emergen cy, to an extent commensurate with the growing necessities of the country, especially in view of the development of Alaska, which is a continent in it self, and of the possible annexation of islands in the'Pacific. On the other hand, it is a mistake not to recognize that our Naval power has more than doubled within the last few years; that the case of any divergency beyond our present resources is the very rare case; that until it comes ships will be gradually taken out of commission and put into reserve in order to reduce running expenses; and that a due regard is necessary to the relation of the National expenditures to the Na tional revenues. The department recommends that the authorization of new ships by the coming Congress, be limited to one battleship for the Pacific coast, where, after the five now under construction, are completed, there will be only two, while on the Atlan tic there will be seven; and also to a a few torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers, both of which- are com paratively of little cost, and tnre of which are desirable in order to bring this swift, mobile, and handily effect ive arm of the service up to its place in the general scheme for coast de fense." Senator Pritchard, of North Caroli na, Chairman of the Committee that is, under a Senate resolution, investi gating the workings of the civil ser vice law, says the Committee will resume work during the first week of the session of Congress, paying par ticular attention to the internal reve nue service, and that its report will probably be submitted to the Senate early in January. Senator Pritchard will not attempt to say what the re port of the Committee will be, further than that he thinks it will probably recommend modification of existing rules, but his personal opinions, which b.9 freely gives, are believed to be about what are held by a majority of the Committee, and probably are in line with the report that will be made. He said: "A too broad extension of the civil service law is calculated to weight it down and render it unpopu lar, thereby endangering its continu ance. A good principal to adopt would be that a scholastic examina tion is proper to determine the fitness of persons for clerical positions, but such a test is not suitable to determine the fitness of a man to fill a position where the duties are executive. The idea that the law is a sort of blanket to cover everything is very unpopu lar." Ex- Speaker Keifer of Ohio is re newing old acquaintances in Washing ton. He says he isn't in active poli tics, but tries to know what's going on. Of Ohio matters he says: "Sen- mW?mTTTTTTTTTT?T?T?!TTT??TTTWTTTTTT?f???TTTY!TTI5 4Z IS
