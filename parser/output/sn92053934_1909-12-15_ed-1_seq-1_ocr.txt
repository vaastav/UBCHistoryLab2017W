TAFT FOR ROOSEVELT POLICIES? LITTLE YET TO INDICATE HE IS against the negro but he denies his guilt. BY TAV. (Special Correspondence of The Argus.) Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. Al though President Taft's message has now been thoroughly read, digested and almost forgotten, the country has little more idea of what the president's policies are, than it possessed before the message became public. This fact Is fully realized, and is being much dis cussed in many quarters in Washing ton, From the broad standpoint of what the general constructive policy legis lative policy of the present adminis tration is to be, the message, failed ut terly to clarify the atmosphere. Correspondents at Sea. That President Taft .did not stata what his policy would be, Is evidenced by the fact that the Washington cor respondents are still sending out dis patches prognosticating legislation. One correspondent writes: "Mr. Taft will put the Roosevelt policies on the statute books;" another: "It is almost certain the Taft policy will be to for get all about the Roosevelt policies. Had the president stated finitely what his policy was to be, no room would have been left for the uncertain ty regarding his intentions that now eixsts. There are, however, two important after-effects of the message noticeable. They are; " 1. The break . between insurgents and standpatters has , become more stra inert than ever. Tho failure of the president to recommend , progressive legislation has apparently convinced the insurgents that the president is jo completely in harmony with the ldea3 of Aldrich and Cannon that it is use less to waste further time endeavoring to enlist his sympathy to their cause. 2. Friends of Roosevelt, stung by Taft's failure to incorporate the real Roosevelt policies in his message, have taken up with new energy and deter mination the movement to secure the 1912 presidential nomination for T. R. Vn faithful to Predecessor. The Roosevelt and Taft messages have been compared paragraph for par agraph, with the result that the Roose- J veltians are declaring with great posi tiveness that Taft's message convicts hfm of unfaithfulness to the man who made him president. It is pointed out that' the Taft mes sage absolutely ignores such subjects as woman and child labor, , employer's liability, safety appliance acts, gov ernment supervision of telegraph and telephone companies, nndesirability of tariff on wood pulp, ' better country roads, children's bureau, and the estab lishment of an 8-hour law in the Dis trict of Columbia, as an example for other, employers.
