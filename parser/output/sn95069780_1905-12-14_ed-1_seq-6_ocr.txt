TOWER OF BABEL. Hi.siory Leaves No Data by Which to Estimate Its Heifrht. The exact date of the building of "Nimrod's Folly , " as the Chaldeans say in alluding to the Scriptural tower of "Babel ( the Armenians speak of it as theTower of the Confusion of Tongues ) or the height to which it pen etrated the rarefied atmosphere of the oriental plains will perhaps never be known. The date of the laying of the foundation of the famous structure is usually set at 2,257 years before Christ , or in the year of the flood 101. The expression of the sacred his torian that its top was to "reach un to heaven" is now generally set down as a strong Hebrew phrase denoting a ver3r lofty tower , but not necessarily moaning that one would reach to the abiding place of the Lord and His hosts. Proof that this is probable may be found in several places in the holy writ. The walls of the cities of Ca naan are described by Moses in similar phraseology. The spies sent out by him returned and reported that tho cities of that country were great and wore "walled up to heaven. " See Deu teronomy 1:2S , 9:1. There is a Jewish legend in the Talmud which tells us that God did not put a stop to the building of the tower until after It had reached a height of 30,000 fathoms , which is equal to nearly twelve Eng lish miles. The sacred historians have not In a single instance left data upon which we can base a calculation of its exact Sieight and general dimensions , and it 3s because of this omission that the Imaginative orientals and other ancient writers have given such fabulous ana extravagant traditions concerning it. Even St. Jerome alleges from the tes timony of eyewitnesses who claim to have seen and examined the ruins of the skyscraping shaft that in his day < born 3-15 A. D. ) it was over four miles high. While considering these unten able notions it may not be out of place to mention that other fanciful writers make its height range all the way from a single furlong to 5.000 miles in height.

"I am a literary man whose nervous energy is a great part of my stock in trade , and ordinarily I have little pa tience with breakfast foods and the extravagant claims made of them. But I cannot withhold my acknowledg ment of the debt that I owe to Grape- 2\"nts food. "I discovered long ago that the very bulkiuess of the ordinary diet whs not calculated to give one a clear head , the power of sustained , accurate thinking. 1 always felt heavy and sluggish in mind as well as body after eating the ordinary meal , which diverted the blood from the brain to the digestive apparatus. " 1 tried foods easy of digestion , but found them usually deficient in nutri ment. I experimented with many breakfast foods and they , too , proved unsatisfactory , till I reached Grape- Nuts. And then the problem was solved. "Grape-Nuts agreed with me perfect ly from the beginning , satisfying my hunger and supplying the nutriment that so many other prepared foods lack. "I had not been using it very long before I found that I was turning out an unusual quantity and quality of work. Continued use has demonstra ted to my entire satisfaction that Grape-Nuts food contains all the ele ments needed by the brain and ner vous system of the hard working pub lic writer.

REMARKABLE and , we are glad to think , ex * ceptional illustration of the evil effects ofcheap and vicious plays upon young spectators is found in the case of the 13-year-old Toronto girl , who kidnapped a baby in the hope of ob taining a reward and afterward killed the child when she found it a nuisance and herself liable to detection. The girl Is of low intelligence , like most of the frequenters of the very cheap theater , and she was stimulated to crime by seeing a play in which the plot hinged upon the kidnapping of an infant with the usual expectation of ransom. It mattered little to her that the villains or villainesses , we do not happen to know which , were subsequently foiled , and the child restored unharmed and unransomed to the millionaire's family from which it was originaly stolen. The "beautiful moral lesson" which plays of this stamp are frequently advertised to teach does not Invariably have time to strike home. In fact the idea that vice is always punished and virtue always triumphant Is worked out with such painful attention to criminal de tail that its value as a moral corrective amounts to prac- tiaclly nothing. It is to be regretted that no plan can be devised for the legal suppression of the vulgar , sensational and cheaply vicious play. Theater-going is a matter of Individual taste , and so long as a production keeps within the limits of ordinary decency it cannot be interfered with by the law , whether it be fhe story of a nasty intrigue Imported from Paris for Broadway consumption or the adventures of a Western desperado as exhibited on the Bowery. Some day we may change all this , but for the present the only check upon the evil is the spread of social work by the churches and settlements , the increase of free lectures and other forms of entertainment by the educa tional authorities and the development of clubs and gym nasiums in the neighborhoods from which the patronage of the cheaper play is most largely drawn. But the play has already a long lead in the race. Brooklyn Eagle. 

HANG ON TO YOUR POLICIES. jOME New York reports say that many hold ers of life insurance policies are refusing to jpay further premiums on them , on account of the recent revelations of crookedness in some Jof the companies. This is folly. By allowing Jj their policies to lapse without making any sort of terms with the companies the holders would lose everything which they have paid in. Not only so , but they would thus increase the funds which would be at the mercy of the crooks in such companies as the crooks dominate. There is a strong probability that most of the insurance companies are managed honestly and economically. More over , the big companies which are being looted by some of their officers are likely to be solvent still. It is not certain that they are solvent , for the examination of their assets by the committee has yet to take place. In the absence of a careful , impartial examination from the outside , the public will be in doubt as to those companies' exact finan cial status. There has been so much crookedness in the conduct of some of their leading oflicers that the word of those persons as to the monetary standing of their coin- panies would carry no weight with the policy holders. The death claims can undoubtedly be paid , but the holders of the ten , fifteen and twenty years term policies will not , at those policies' maturity , get anywhere near the amount which they were led to belicvve they would get , although the technically guaranteed payments will probably be met. The sensible thing for the policy holders is to hang on to their policies and make the best terms possible with the companies. When the committee of inquisition in New T STRENUOUS STILLNESS. Perfect stillness is something that scarcely seems compatible with physi cal strenuosity ; nevertheless , posing for an artist may become , in the main tenance for long periods of a difficult attitude , one of the most trying of ath letic feats. When Mcissonier , the fa mous French artist , was painting one of his battle scenes he hired several old soldiers for models , seasoned , tough veterans , whose experience and endur ance would , he thought , be useful in enabling them both to understand the positions required and to hold them. They did so , indeed , as well as any one could ; but it was an every-day affair for a model to faint , and more than once to collapse with exhaustion , find require the services of a physician. Especially difficult were the poses representative of cavalrymen slain or wounded and falling from their sad dles. Despite an ingenious arrange ment of straps and slings hung from the ceiling of the studio to afford such support as was possible , these poses remained so hard that one old soldier declared fervently when the picture was finished : "Monsieur Meissonier , I have been six times wounded , and once nearly frozen on the field , but it was all noth ing to this. Nothing ! Nothing ! It Is not hard to fall out of the saddle , really. A bullet helps one so neatly one scarcely knows when one touches the ground. But then , you see , one Is allowed to fall all the way : one is not halted in mid-air. "You are painting a great picture , monsieur , and I am proud to be in it : but if you could have put me there with a pistol instead of a paint-brush , I should have preferred it. " It was long a current tale that the model for another painting by Meis- Bonier , entitled "The Brawl , " actually died as the result of long posing in an unnaturaJy strained position for one of the two intertwined and struggling combatants in the picture. This was not true. Indeed , he lived to boast much and volubly of his achievement , and it served him as his chief professional recommendation af terward.

HE WHO NEGLECTS HIS COUNTRY. HE notion prevails among some Americans that there is something degrading and debasing T in being in politics. There are many American citizens who pass as educated , Intelligent and respectable , who yet pride themselves on their 'Snorauce of politics and their abstention from , . , in-- n - political activity. This false and foolish notion is passing away , but there vs still too much of it. Such an attitude is based on the delusion that politics is a small , petty , and almost unnecessary business , with which men of ability need not concern themselves , because almost anybody can attend to it as well as its requirements de mand. The truth is , of course , that what Abraham Lincoln truly called "the great business of government" is the greatest and most important business on earth , on whose capable , intelligent , and upright transaction the welfare of every other business depends. Furthermore , in this country every citizen is a share holder in this business. Furthermore , this nation offers to its citizens such opportunities for personal freedom , pros perity and advancement as no other offers. Hence both gratitude and self-interest should move every citizen to take an interest in politics , that this great business , which is his in every sense , may be efficiently and uprightly car- vied on. Politics is corrupt only when and where honest and able citizens neglect to attend to their business. Yet hun dreds of thousands think themselves more respectable be cause they neglect their business ! The shame and the folly of it ! May the day soon come when the American citizen who docs not take an interest in politics the American citizen who neglects his country will be classed with the mar ? who neglects his family.

I know some brilliantly successful business women who live the year round in hotels because they declare they cannot shoul- | der household responsibilities , but they are al ways more or less restless , lonely and pettish. It is very nice to be able to touch a button and know that a small uniformed boy is running to do your bidding , but there will come moments when you wonder why every thing tastes alike on the handsomely appointed table , and you wish you might cook just one little meal , or know the joy of buying the pretty furniture you see in the shop win dows , or lay in a supply of dainty linen.
