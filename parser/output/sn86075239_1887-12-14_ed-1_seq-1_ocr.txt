Sheep Raising Should be Nurtured Among Farmers; the Tobacco Tax Abolished, and that on Whisky Retained. NEw Youx, December 9.-The 7 ribune contains a long interview with James G. Blaine on president Cleveland's mes sage. He says; "I have been reading an abstract of the president's message and have been especially interested in the comments of the London papers. These papers all assume to declare the message is a free trade manifests, and ev idently are anticipating an enlarged mar ket for English fabrics in the United States as a consequence of the president's recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." Besides your general and sweeping opposition to the president's recommen dations, have you any further specific ob jections? "Yes." answered Mr. Blaine. "I should seriously object to a repeal of the duty on wool. To repeal that would work great injury to many interests, and would seriously discourage what we should earnestly encourage, namely, 

SHEEP CULTURE AMONG FARMERS throughout the United States. To break down woolgrowing and be dependent on foreign countries for the blankets we sleep under, and the coat that covers our back, is not a wise policy for a national government to enforce." "Do you think if the president's recom mendation were adopted it would increase our export trade?" "Possibly, in some few articles of pecu liar construction it might; but it would increase our import trade ten fold as much in great staple fabrics, in woolen and cot ton goods, in iron, in steel, in all the thousand and one shapes in which they are wrought. How are we to export sta ple fabrics to the markets of Europe un less we make them cheaper than they do in Europe, and how are we to manufac ture them cheaper unless we get cheaper labor than they have ?" THE 

LABOR QUESTION. "Then you think the question of labor underlies the whole subject?" "Of course it does," replied Mr. Blaine. "It is, in fact, the entire question. When ever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every de partment to work as cheaply and live as poorly in the United States as similar workmen in' Europe we can ,of course manufacture just as cheaply as they do in England and France. But I am totally opposed to the policy that would entail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to social and financial revolution; one that would bring untold distress." "Yes, but might not the great farming class be benefitted by importing articles from Europe, instead of buying them at higher prices at home?" "The moment," answered Mr. Blaine, "You begin to import freely from Europe you drive our own workmen from me chanical and manufacturing pursuits. In the same proportion they become tillers of the soil, increasing steadily the agricul tural products and decreasing steadily the large home demand, which is constantly enlarging as home manufacture enlarge. That, of course, works great injury to the farmer, glutting the. market with his pro ducts, and tending constantly to lower prices." Mr. Blaine declared also that he would abolish the tobacco tax, but would retain that on whiskey. Baet. g Down. VIEY NA, December 12- The Pester Lloyd, in a pacific article, invites RI`sia to state her policy regarding Bulgaria, re lying on the disposition of thealliedpow ers to meet Russia's views and to main tain peace with a loyal observance of treaties.

Harper and counsel retired for consulta tion, and on their return both sides an nounced there would be-no arguments. Judge Jackson then began to charge the ,jury. The judge's charge occupied an hour and fifty minutes. It was strongly against Harper, and the judge declared the prisoner committed wrohngful acts.of his own admission. Summing up, he said the court instructs the jury that it must find on his own testimony that the de fendant had committed a crime. The jury were then instructed as to the form of the verdict, and they were taken to their room to begin their consultation. The verdict will not be received until today: BISMARCK PLOTTING. The German Military Service Bill Creates a Stir. BERLix, December 12.-The preamble of the new German military service bill was issued tonight. It sets forth that the German army is composed of men whose liability to serve in the active army ex tends only to 12 years, whereas in the Russian army the period is 15 years, and in the French 20. Besides this, it must be considered, says the preamble, that the geographical position of Germany exposes her to attacks by powerful ar mies on two frontiers simultaneously. Her security lies in her strength, and this should be greater than it is at pres ent, and an end must'be put to the exist ing unendurable condition of things. The government therefore expects that to secure the passage of the present bill it will be sufficent to appeal to the patri otism of the German people. By the bill before the reichstag the six-yearly classes formerly composed part of the land strum, are placed in immediate readiness for any emrgency. The whole tone of this remarkable manifesto suggests that the recent out burst of the official press over the mass ing of Russian troops on the frontier had something of a fictitious characte* Prince Bismarck is known to have great ly hurt the chances for the immediate passage of the landstrum bill, which the millitary press now estimates will add 500,000 men to the effective force in the event of mobilization, so a press cam paign, recalling the similar agitation preceding the septennate vote, was in cited, and will be sustained until the bill passes. The concentration of Russian troops on the frontier at the present time is part of a long concocted plan of the Rus sian war office. They are considered to be necessitated by the special "difficulties of Russian mobilization. At the same time the presence of formidable masses of Russian troops within striking dis tance of the frontier will be held-by the reichstag as a justification for the com plete reform of the military. Couldn't Agree. BuTTE, December 10.-From the time that the United States grand jury began its labors at the term of court in Deer Lodge, there has been constant complaint on the part of United States district at torney Smith. On Tuesday in response to a grand howl raised by Mr. Smith against the grand jury, judge Galbraith summonea the jurors before him and lec tured them as to their duties andthe folly of failing to find true bills against parties when conclusive evidence of guilt had been brought. Thursday morning the grand jury having failed to find a bill against the men charged with the lynch ing trouble at Philipsburg last July, Judge Galbraith ordered the sheriff to bring the jurors before him, and when they were assembled, he said with much acrimony: "Gentlemen of the jury: I don't know that the court has anything to thank you for. You are discharged from all further duty." He thjn instructed the clerk to issue a new venire and in con formity with these instructions the fol lowing persons from this city were sub penaed to act on the grand jury: C. W. Goodale, George W. Newkirk, J. W. Pen rose, Thomas York, Mr. Foster, M. Gens berger, James B. Royce jr., Fred Loeber, D. J. Hennessy, Charles Shoemaker and James H. Lynch. Copper and Iron Rising. NEw 

YORK, December 12.--A'Boston dispatch says an eastern firm has offered to take the entire production of all the copper'mines in this country, except the Calumet and Hecla, for the ensuing year at 15% cents per pound. The syndicate evidently intends buying every ton of copper until the market price reaches $80 a ton. The extraordinary advance in Glasgow during the past three days has, according to private cables, had the effect of rousing the speculative spirit to an extraordinary pitch on the other side. New York metal mnen say the excitement in the European iron market is naturally having a great effect upon all subsidiary metals over the whole world. Taking Things Easy.

SUMMED UP BY LEADING NEW YORK AND C~CAGO DAILIES. It is Considered a Bid for the Republican Candidacy and the Issue on Which He Would go Be fore the Country. WAISINGTON, December 9.-In com menting on Blaine's message, the Times (independent) says: "This then is the stim of Blaine's policy and as he is the leader of the republican party at present, it mast be taken as the policy of the republicans until they repudiate it, and it would be well for them to hasten to do it. Itis not a policy they can go before the people with." - The Tribune (republican) says: "Blaine, in Europe, speaks as an American; Cleve land, in America, speaks as a British man ufacturer anxious to be admitted without any charge to t share of the best and lar gest marketin the world." The World (democratic) says: "The Maine statesman's interview is in fact a proclamation that Blaine considers him self the chosen champion of protection, and that he is ready to enter the presiden tial lists again as such. The democratic party could not ask for a better issue." The Sun says: "If brother Blaine en tertains such loose notions of the relations between the fcderal government and the states, it strikes us that he would be a conspicuously unfit person to entrust with the management of the nation's financial affairs." CHICAGo, December 9.-The Tribune (republican), commenting editrially on the Blaine message, says: "Blaine, as might have been expected, has presented high tariff protection from a partisan point of view as an opposition issue to the pres ident's views on tariff reduction. Blaine's interview will have to stand upon its merits, it will be endorsed or condemned in accordance with the. value of the argu ments set forth, andr ublic judgment will not be inflanced by the distinguished name, behind him. It is the weakest ground he ever yet occupied, and no na tional party can expect to go into a presi dential campaign on that issue, no matter who may be its leader, and win, The surplus must be settled in some way and in a different way from what iflli s been settled. It bannot be settled in accer dance with the Blaine idea." 

WHAT PEOPLE SAY. Both Free Traders and Republicans De lighted With the Message. WASiamiovorN, December 9.--The presi dent's message takes everybody by 'sur prise. Free traders and republicans are delighted with it-free traders, because it commits Cleveland and the democratic party to a removal or reduction of the duty on wool and a relaxation of taxation on many dutiable articles, and a radical re duction of duties imposed upon raw ma terial entering into manufactories. Why he reccommends virtually the removal of the duty on wool with its revenue to the government of only about $8,000,000, and says nothing about that great staple, su gar, with its revenue of over $50,000,000, is passing strange. Comments are varied. A Pennsylvania democrat says: "It means 100,000 repub lican majority next year in New York state, and gives New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to the hands of our pol itical enemies." Another says: "Itis the first step taken to drive Randall into the republican par ty, and he wont go alone. Another said: "It is the outcropplngs of the summer interviews Carlisle had with the president at Oak View. Mr. Cleveland's Carlisleism sticks out in every paragraph." Republicans are jubilant. Tom Reed says: "Just like Cleveland. No one else could have produced such republican campaign thunder. What his rebel flag order did with the. soldier element, this mossage will do with 'the farmers, espec lally the woolgrowers." Senator Davls says: "It isonly another evideace that the republican party has passed the slough of its despondency, and it is on the up grade." Senator Sabin thinks: "If the repub .san party have been looking for another big democratic blunder, this is it.+ They don't want anything better to give them a boom toward the victory that will crown the party next year. Anad o it;g ges: "The message -ii a boomerang for the Republican party," mnay be heard on thq street, hotel corridors, anywhere-that men. do congregate. aselis se..o si Greet. 

SUIST PBaTuSm, December T7--The Journal de aint Pete rsbujrg cngrat lates France upon the election of V. Sai Carnest as presidest, bit contdemns the mob oras for sing Russia's name for which was called for by the secretary, is the result of Indian inspector Armstrong's visit. The latter is now here, but refuses to make public the result of his investiga tions. It is believed, however, that he found Williamson had neglected to chm ply with the secretary's order to advertise the grazing privileges, leaving the, monopoly in the hands of one outfit, who' had simply a private agreement asto their occupancy. When directed to lease the ,lands, Williamson wrote the secretary counselling delay, saying the Indians wanted the steckmen then on the lands to have the grazing. The secretary made no reply. Armstrong oso found that Wil liamson had made a contract giving Mc Cormick McNutt the right to cut hay on the reservation, though having no right to make such a contract. Armstrong tore their'contract up and made them pay the Indians "$2 per ton for the hay. Charges of a personal nature were also made, that Williamson is loud, profane and quick tempered. A 

CRAZY FRENCHMAN 'Attempts the Life of Ex-Prime Minister Ferry. PAras, December 12.-Ferry has been shot by a man named Aubertin, who ap peared in the hall of the chamber of dep uties and asked to see both Ferry and Goblet. On Saturday Goblet did not re spond to Aubertin'a request for an inter view, but Ferry did, and on his appear ance Aubertin drew arevolver and fired three times at him. The wounds were slight and M. Ferry was able to proceed to the hospital, supported by friends. In reply to inquires by friends as to the se verity of his wound, h% responded: It is nothing." Aubertin has been arrested. Bystanders tried to lynch Aubertin after he had fired the shots, but wqre prevented with difficulty from carrying out their in tention. The real name of the assailant is Breckein. He is 20 years old. He states that he is one of a band of 20 revo lutionists. The band drew lots, and it fell to him to Gommit the first crime. Berekein declares that he swore to kill Ferry. After his injuries had been ai tended to at the hospital, Ferry returned to his home on foot. A bulletin issued by Dr. Trelot states that the wound in Ferry's chest is a contusion. In consequence of the attempt on the life of Ferry, there were many heated quarrels in the chamber of deputies be-, tween moderates and radicals. Rouvier joined the discussions, accusing the rad icals of provoking, weak-minded persons to deeds of violence. Several scuffles ensued and it is expected they will lead to duels. The Virginia Legislature. RicHMOND, Virginia, December 7.-, The general assembly of Virginia met at aton and organizet. Governor Lee's message contains many important sug gestions relative to state matters. In view of the recent ddcision of the United States supreme court, bearing on the Vir ginia debt question, the governor recom mends the passage of a .joint resolution suspending legal proceedings against those who have tendered coupons in pay ment of taxes. as he was assured by au thority that such action would decidedly benefit all parties concerned. He thinks when the bondholders consider this de cision they will be willing to accept such offer as the state can make, based upon the surplus revenue to be applied to the payment of interest on the principal of what the state considers her just debt. Rnssia Preparing. PInts, December 7.-According to pri vate advices from Warsaw, the massing of Russian troops on the frontier is at tributable to advices received by Russia of a concerted plan by Germany and Aus tria for united action in the event of war between either of these powers and Rus sia. In that contingency, it was propos ed that Germany and Austria should sud denly invade Russian Poland and occupy Warsaw, by using greater facilities for mobilizing. In consequence of the dis covery of this alleged project, Russia re Bolved to compensate for her slow power of mobilizing, by a permanent increase of her frontier forces. The movement implied no aggression, but is purely a de fensive precaution. Woolgrowers Uniting.

LARGE VEINS. A MINING DISTRICT THAT IS COX ITG TO THE FRONT, And Whose Ores Will be Brought to Great Falls for Reduction, or Shipment, next Sunm S mer. Quite a number of old-timers of the Barker and Neihart mining regions have been here recently. From conversation with them we learn that Barker is sure to come to the front the coming summer. The past three weeks have developed the fact that there are a series of blanket veins or or flat deposits in the immediate vicinity of that camp, which show all the signs of a deposit similar to Leadville. Many miners have staid with this camp for the past eight years, knowing that the minerals were there. From the latest discoveries it seems that not only have they the carbonates of silver and lead, but also it is going to be a gold pro ducing camp. Specimens have been - brought in this week !y George Allis that conclusively prove that Barker is a gold, silver, copper, lead and probably a tin bearing camp. The specimens exhibited by Mr. Allis are essentially gold bearing in character. As eight years ago, old miners predicted that in the future all prospectors in this vicinity would search for ore other than I yet found, it seems now, that we are go ing to have in the Barker district a large area of carbonate deposits similar in character to that of Leadville; not only that, but large oxide deposits of copper at the head of the trail; and in addition thereto, new discovery of gold in that vicinity. The mountains in that region are al most wholly unprospected, and on the advent of the railroad we may expect to see the whole of that locality completely covered with locations which will furnish their quota to the future reduction works at Great Falls. THE CRUISER ATLANTA. S~ecretary Whitney Recommends a Fur ther Trial. WAsHINm TOx , December 10.-Captain Bunce's report as commander of the crui ser Atlanta, is published today. The only new phrase of the matter is the endorse ment of secretary Whitney, which dis poses of the subject in the following lan guage: The departn~ent deems that the Atlanta should have some cobtinuous service be fore charges are made. The suggestions of captain Bunce are valuable and entire ly proper, doubtless without any expecta tions that his comments upon the ship would be treated as anything else than a professional discussion for the benefit ot the department in the future. Many of the criticisms have been discussed here tofore, and some of her known defects were intentionally overlooked by her de. signers for the purpose of securing bene fits in other directions. Aside from the lack of speed, she represents a type with merits and defects, and the balance can be struck after she has had service..None of the alleged defects have been repro duced in subsequent vessels now in course of construction. A Free Trader. NEw Yorn, December 7.--Mayor Hew itt said after he had read the president's message: "I think he is very wise in confining its subject to the financial question, He grasps the fact that the surplus in the treasury is dangerous both to our busi ness interests and to political morality of congress. He points out clearly that it can only be reduced by increased expen ditures or by the reduction of taxation; the latter is, of course, the only states nranlike method. He proposes taritf re duction substantially upon the raw mate rials of industry. This is the policy I recommended in 1883, and every year subsequently inrillswhich I introduced or in speeches which I made upon the floor. - _ Our Benton Budget.

ANOTHER STAGE. LINE. Lewiston Wishes More Direct Railroad Communication. There is some talk of ant effort being made to get a tri-weekly mail line estab lished aetween Lewiston and Stanford for more direct communication with -Great Falls, Fort Benton, Helena and the east. To reach points on the Manitoba, people of this section have to travel in a circle and go at least forty miles out of their way under the present stage facilities. The new line will take the most direct route to Stanford, probably following the' Spring creek valley down to the Judith as near as practicable. This line would be a great convenience to parties who de sire to visit the "Future Great," Helena or Benton. To parties going east- it would save a night's staging. Under the head, "The New Stage Line," found else where, it will be seen that Great Falls has become the terminus of the Montana ' Stage Company's line instead of Benton, the change taking place last week. As all roads lead to Rome,".no doubt Great Falls would render. valuable aid in the establishment of this route, as it would enure to the benefit of that city.
