Following is a synopsis of Presi dent Hayes' message, read in both houses at the assembling of the Forty- Sixth Congress yesterday : He congratulates Congress on the suc cessful execution of the Resumption act. The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals depos ited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes re deemed is about forty million dollars. He refers to the consequent revival of trade, and says the increasing foreign demand for our manufacturers' and agricultural pro ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the first of July last to November 15th, to the amount of $59,C30,0CD. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying im provement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government, bearing only four per cent, interest, have been sold at or above par sufficient in amount to pay off all of the National debt, which was re deemable under - present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by this process of refunding the debt since March 1st, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the National debt which matures within less than two years is $;92,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears interest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing six per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of four per cent, bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about eleven million dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest paid by the United States,- fur ther legislation is required, which, it is hoped will be provided by Congress dur ing its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States dur ing the last fiscal year, was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since the pas sage of the act for that purpose to Novem ber 1st, 1879, wa3 $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the Government. The pending of the propo sition for a union of action between the United States and the principal-commercial nations of Europe, to the effect that a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver ia the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend that Con gress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming year, its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempt ing further experimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of au thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal rates. Tho market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely lless than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with ach other, it both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world, lha retirement from circulation of United Slates notes with the capacity oflegal ten der in private contracts, is a step to be taken in oUr progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and eecunty oi the people, it is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of theGovern- mnt, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, r.nd a viulatioa of sound financial principle?. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of le gal tende.r between private individuals was not authorized, except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose, was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period. Uonsiaent with the attainment oi the object for wnichthey were provided.the policy of the United fctates, steadily ad hered to from the adoption of the Consti tution, has been to avoid the creation of a National debt, and when from necessity in the time of war debts have been crea ted, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. VVith this iew and lor this purpose, it is recom mended that the existing laws for the ap cumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited neroid be maintained. If any change of the objects or rales of taxation is deemed necessary by Uongress, it is suggestbd that experience has known that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of these articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars annually to the Treasury. On the subject cf polygamy the Presi dent says: Utah has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interests of the Na- tion, as well as the welfare of the citizens of the ierntory, require its advance from the territorial torm of government to the re sponsibilities and privileges of a btate This important change, however, will not be approved by the country, while the citizens of Utah, in a very considerable number, uphold a practice which is con demed as a crime by the laws of all civil ized communities throughout the world He mentions that the law for the sunnres- sion of polygamy has now been decided by the Supreme Court as to be within the leg islative power of Congress, and binding, as a ru'e of action for nil who reside within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesi tation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectually exe cuted. If not lumciently strong mis pro visions it should be amended, and in aid of the purpose in view I recommend that more comprehensive and mors search ing methods for preventing as well as pun ishing this crime be provided. If nee essary to secure obedience to the law: the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or od- pose the enforcement of the law on this subject. xne elections ot the past year, though occupied only with State officers, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which have attended them all over the country, new and decisive evi dence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and com plete establishment at whatever erst, of universal security and freedom in the ex ercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in tbe sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests ofthe Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever display the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship, and mat tne power oi public opinion will override all political prejudice and all sectional and State attachments, in demanding that, all over our wide territory, the name and character of a citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and pattiotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Con gress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown, and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of the exec utive and legislative authorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can bVset at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious ob jection wili thwart or delay the complete pacification ofthe country or retard the general diffusfon of prosperity. On the subject of civil service re form, which the President treats at some length, he says : "In view of the facts that during a consid erable period the government of Great Britain has been dealing with administra tive problems and abuses in various par ticulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that in recent years J.he meas ures adopted were understood to have been effective and in every respect highly satis factory, I thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thor ough investigation for this purpose. Tho result has been an elaborate and compre hensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the Parliamentary patronage and of official interference witn the freedom of elections. It shows. that after long trials of various kinds of examinations.and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subor dinate administration of that country of British India. The completion of the re port, owing to the extent of labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Con gress to make any provision either for tho composition or the expenses of the com mission, has been postponed until the pres ent time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the reform measures of another government are of no authority for us, they are entitled to influence to the ex tent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend them to our consideration. Tho views I have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged.ex cept in so far as enlarged experience has opened my sense of the duty of both the officers and of the people themselves to co operate for their removal. A large and re sponsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and effi ciency rests upon the President, and it has been my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and grad ual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about tho radical cnange ui oyoucui essential 10 make our adminis trative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority, it is in the power of the Execu tive 10 ao mucu to promote such a reform, but it can not bo too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on tho part of Con gress and a considerate and intelligent support among the people. He refers to the work of the Civil Ser vice Commission and the failure of Con gress to appropriate money for the re sumption of the work of the Com On the subject of competitive examinations tor omce ne 8ys : 1 think the economy, purity and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their sys tematic introduction wherever practical) e throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provis ions in order to secure consistency and uni form justice. Reports of examinations heretofore made show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules can not fail to be of decided benefit to the ser vice. I deem it my duty to renew the re commendation contained in my annual message or lecemDer, 1877, requesting Congress to make the neccessary appro priations for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moder ate compensation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labors upon or under the Commission as the Executive may direct. It may not be ea-y. ana it may never, perhaps, be necessary, to define with precision the proper limit of political action on tho part of Federal officers; but, while their right to hold and freely express their opinions can not bo questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to fthr sub jects the timo needed for tho proper dis- cuarge ot tneir omcial duties, nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political ac tions of those who hold different opinions. Keasons of justice ar.d public policy, quite analogous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppression of mo privaie citizen, impose upon tne Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary ex actions, from whatever aspect considered. The practice of miking levies for party pur poses, upon the salaries of officers, is high ly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citi zen to givo his own money in aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free a3 any other citizen to refuse to maite such gifts. If salaries are but a fair com pensation for time and labor, it is gross in justice, &c, &c. Tho President calls a' tontion to foreirn affairs, showing that we .are at peace with all the world. He calls attention to the re ports of the heads of departments, dis cusses tho Indian fquestion and cloe3 bv calling attention to District of Columbia anairs. Benefactors. When a board of eminent physicians and chemists announced the discovery that, by combining some well-known, valuable remedies, the most wonderful medicine was produced, which would cure such a wide range of diseases that most all other remedies could be dis pensed with, many were sceptical ; but proof of its merits by actual trial has dispelled all doubt, and today the dis coverers of that great medicine, Hop Bitters, are honored and blessed by all as benefactors.
