December 1.—Represen tative Morrison, chairman of the Ways and Means committee, was asked to-night by an Associted Press reporter if he thought there was any probability of the enact ment of any tariff legislation the present session, and he replied that he had not yet had an opportunity to find ont how the members felt upon the subject. It might be there had been some modification of opinion by the representatives since the last session, and it was certain that if there had not been some change of views by the Democratic members no tax redaction could be had except by the aid of Repub licans. He added. *T don't propose to at tempt any experiments, but it upon inqui ry there is reason to think that a bill pro posing a moderate reduction could pass this session, I shall certainly bring in snch a bill." Speaker Carlisle said to a reporter to night that it was not probable there would be any general tariff' legislation this ses >ion. ' There is not time, he said, and the fact that a new administration is about to come in. the Democrats and Republicans alike are disinclined to attempt anything like a general revision of the tariff' now. The disc ussion of the Mexican treaty will, he thinks, open up the general tariff' ques tion and lead to some talk upon it. bat nothing further. He said it was possible that some attempts would be made this session to remedy certain inequalities in the present tariff' but it was too early to predict the result respecting any general revision. He said that even should they all agree that snch revision should be made when they come to settle upon the details they would find snch a difference ot opin ion that months would be needed in which to complete the work. He was equally convinced that nothing would be done in the matter of catting down the internal taxes, because should such an attempt be made it would precipitate the whole ques tion of tax reduction. Chicago Eleceion Fraud» Chicago, November 29.—The Timet will sav to-morrow that the evidence of iraud in the second precinct of the l?th ward is now positive, and that this was shown to Mr. Brand this afternoon, whereupon he telegraphed to stop mandamus proceedings and that he will now make no effort to ob tain his seat. The Times also claims that the Democrats will make no Inrtber effort to control the legislature. Canvass Completed. Springfield. 111.. December 1.—The State canvassing board completed its work to-day and decided the contest in the 13th district in favor of Mnlhevan and against Klnpp. This will make the Legislature a tie on joint ballot in case Leman, Rep. in the 6th district is seated, or will give a Democratic majority of two in case Brand Dem. of the same district is given a seat Klupp claims ninety votes lor him in the 19th precinct of the 14th ward were counted for his opponent aud s r ys he will present the case to the United States Grand Jnryor will contest for the Senate. The tacts were shown to be. before both the county and State canvassing board, by a clerical error, that Klapp was originally given ninety votes too many. As both Klupp and Mulhevan are Democrats the complexion of the Legislature will not be changed in either case. Gov. Hamilton will announce his decision in the Brand Leman case to-morrow. A Proposition. Chic ago, December 1.—An open letter is to be published here to-morrow irom Randolph Brand. Democratic candidate for State Senator from the Sixth District, to Henry IV. Leman, his Republican oppo nent, Brand says that while he run ahead of his thicket elsewhere, and had reason to lielieve he would do the same in the 2d district, Eighteenth ward, where it is al leged that fraud was committed which added 200 votes to Brand's count, yet if Leman's claim to this effect is correct it would show that he Brand ran behind his ticket in that precinct, still from the fact that the ballots in the box indicate that Leman's lather-in-law. son-in-law and other intimate friends voted for Brand, he Brand is inclined to the opinion that these ballots are fraud nient. He therefore pro poses to Leman that they jointly canvass the votes in the entire district, and if it is found that ballots of a similar character have been deposited in other precincts, the matter can be settled by the testimony ot the voters throughout the district on the question for whom they voted.

Washington. »December 1 —The Secre tary of the Interior has been informed that the local land officers at Cheyenne have refused to receive the deposition of an applicant for the purchase of desert lands in submitting a final proof when taken before other than the register and receiver of the distict in which the land is situated. The Commissioner of the General Land Office has been requested to issue an order that final deposition of the applicant can be taken before the register and receiver of the land office in the district in which the land is situated, or before the clerk ol'any court or register or United States Com missioner. Secretary Taller has made an important modification of the ruling of Secretary Schurz in the desert land cases. Secretary Schurz held that desert land entries were not as signable, and so far Secretary Teller con curs. bat that portion of Secretary Schurz's ruling which says : "There is no discretion which authorizes me to regard such claims as assignable because assignment was made under misapprehension." does not meet with Secretary Teller's approval. He says : "I do not understand that a party is under misapprehension of the law so as to lose any right when he acts under ot ficial interpretation. Misapprehension in such case is on the part of the interpreting authority and not upon him who in prose cution of the claim conforms to such in terpretation." Pennsylvania Coal Fields. Philadelphia.

Recently this man fell a victim to the pre vailing plague, and after his death Judge Finley again went to Letcher. At this term of the Letcher court the man was to be tried for murder. He was out on bail, and his friends, all men of the same des perate stripe as the murderer, determined that he should not be punished. The case was *set for Wednesday, and on that day the accused came marching into town car rying a double-barreled shotgun and a belt full*of revolvers, followed by a score of his friends armed to the teeth. The arri val of the murderer and his armed band was followed almost immediately by an other of the same size and all carrying shotguns and pistols. This second gang was composed of friends of the victim. Congressional Committees. Washington.

Loomis, traveling agent of a New Y'ork firm, is in the city to-day. having just re turned from a trip through the plague sSn district of eastern Kentucky. Loomis said: "I was tour days in Martin countv without disposing of a single arti cle. î*eople are absolutely crazv^ They have no use for anything but coffins. A r great deal has been printed in the news papers about the situation in Martin and adjoining counties, but it has Deen but an imperfect reflex of the existing deplorable condition. I know of instances where whole families have died within a week, where a neighborhood has been swallowed up in the grave, where one man has sur vived to bury his family and friends, and then been found dead with no living creature near him, except in some cases a faithful dog. Flocks of sheep and droves of cattle that used to brow e on the hill sides and along the range of the Cumber lands now lie dead and rotting, while peb bles glisten in the bottom of the creek beds. Wells and cisterns have been drained to the bottom and springs are no longer to be relied upon for a supply of wafer. The ground is literally oarched. and where vegetation formerly bloomed luxuriantly there is now nothing but de cay. Thousands are said to have died within the past two weeks." "What, in the opinion of the natives, is the cause of this fatal calamity?' "It is very evident that the chief agent of death is starvation. The people in those districts are almost without com munication with the outside world. An occasional drummer, like myself, strays among them once a year and a few of the most prosperous visit some of the large cities once in a lifetime. A good season brings with it bountiful crops and wool and other native products are rudely man ufactured into clothing; but when the crops fail them the order of things ;s re versed. I am speaking now of the back woods neighborhoods, where the plague has raged with the greatest fatality. I learned while in Martin county that the crop yield for two successive seasons had been a failure. The natives are without money and without means to purchase bread. The shutting off of the water sup ply has brought to the surface a poisonous liquid, and, famished for water, the peo pie drank it, and the consequence was death. The first symptoms are violent gripings, and after this a raging headache. A hot lever then ensues and the patient usually lingers two days, suffering mental agony before death. •'I understand several physicians have been commissioned by the State to make a careful analysis of the water and describe tne poisonous ingredient. Relief has re cently been dispatched to Martin from neighboring counties. Before I left there was a light" rainfall with a prospect of its continued falling. The opinion prevails that the plague has passed through its most dangerous stages, and is cow on the wane. During tfie last two days of my stay I heard of very few deaths." Gov. Cleveland Accepts. New York, Nov. 29.—Governor Cleve land was waited upon in Albany by a dele gation of the Actors Fu:. 1 Society to-day and invited to attend the annual perform 1 ance for the benefit of the fund at the Academy of Music, this city, next Thurs day afternoon, The Governor replied that he had been competed to decline many invitations of many kinds, but as he appreciated the always ready generosity of the actors when other people were in trouble, and as this was the only charity the actors had for themselves he would accept the invitation.
