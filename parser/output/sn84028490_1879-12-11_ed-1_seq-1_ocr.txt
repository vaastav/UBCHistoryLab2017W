LlizleFalk, a laundry girl, in the employ of the Russell House, at Detroit, while descending In the freight compartment of the hotel elevator on Friday, was caught between the elevator and a projecting beam, and berneck and lower Jaw were so terribly crushed as to cause Instant death. The latest news from the Indians Is that the Commission is progressing fairly. Jack Is on the stand. 8o far be has proved the most valuable witness yet examined, answering all questions promptly and keeping nothing back. He olalms the removal of the Agenoy was (he commence ment of the trouble; that on an elevation of 8,700 feet, with frost every month la the year, farming was Impossible; that he and his bands received no rations for a year, which, he claims, was a vi olation or the Ireaty of 1878; that his engagement with the troops was a fair fight; calls Douglass a squaw man for having attacked the Agency, and Insists that a white man, under the same circum stanoes, would have fought Thornburgh. A fire at Colevllle, an oil town twelve miles from Bradford, Pa., destroyed the rigs, boiler homes, and machinery at three oil wells, and 2,000 barrels of oil, with tanks and buildings, be longing to Whiting & Bradley and Captain Em erson.

New York, Deo. 7. Repeated warnings by col lision at sea with other vessels, and the danger ot them with Icebergs, have led to the suggestion that an electric light carried by steamships would lessen the danger. The cost and bother of an eleotrlc light apparatus have prevented the trial. The Inmau Line have, however, decided to test the use of the light, and will place one on the bows of the City of Berlin on her next voyage hence, which will be about Christmas time. Bhould it be successful they will thus equip ev ery ship they have. The body or an unknown man wis round In the woods about three miles west or North Man chester, Indiana, Saturday, partly eaten by hogs. It Is supposed to be David Kerns, a well to do far mer, living close to where the body was found. It was thought Kerns had gone to Kansas. He bad had trouble with his wife, and left to rid himself or her about two or three weeks ago. The bod) is too badly mutilated to be certain whether It is Kerns or not. If it is, In all probability he wu murdered. The eoroner will hold an Inquest Boston, Mass., Dec. 4. At Worcester yesterday In the trial of Francis E. Hayden, of Fltchburg, for the murder of his sister, the motion of Mr, Verry to quash the second and third counts In the Indictment was allowed. Laura Wilder, eousln of the prisoner, who lived in the fam'ly, testified that Francis gave Sarah medicine on the night or her death; soon after retiring Sarah was taken very sick; prisoner came into the room al ready dressed and, inquiring If she wag sick, gave her something which he said was ginger, A large exodus or rreedmen from Texas to Kansas ha begun. The Dallas (Tex.) Herald ays: "Nearly every train that goes north car ries a lot or them. So latthey have been coming from the Southern counties, but the movement la preadlng and li beginning to be be felt In this section of the State." Los Plnos, Dec In answer to the demand of IhelCommlssloner or Justice delivered by Ouray, he will deliver for' trial Douglass and l hose In dians engaged In the massacre of Meeker and employes provided they are tried In Washington. The people of Colorado aft hot friendly and a fair trial bore or In New Mexico Is not to be ex pected. Bonneri have Just started, by order of Ouray, to bring In those Indians called for by the Commission. In a difficulty between Lingston Phillips and George Mitchell at Corlbtb, Miss., Saturday night, Phillips shot Mitchell with a double-barreled shot gun, killing hint Instantly. The murderer was sent to Jail. The British India Steam Navigation Compa ny's;hlp Eldorado, with ninety-five passengers and a Lasoar crew or about sixty, put Into Ply mouth on Saturday to repair her damage after a hairbreadth escape from total loss In the Bay of Biscay, where the vessel lay for .80 hours dtulng the storm of Wednesday and Thursday In a state of total disablement.' Nearly all the orew during the whole time were Incapacitated for duty by fear, and but for the exertions of the passengers therejs little question but that she would have gone down. The waves broke one of the ventil ating shafts of the vessel and flooded the engine room and all the fires were extinguished. The Lascar crew abandoned their posts and the male passengers at the Captain's call bailed and Sumped water from Wednesday night to Tburs ay night when tbe storm abated and the fires were relighted. T. DEWITT TALMAGE. THE SPIRIT CHRIST ONE OF GENTLENESS. "Let Him That is Without Sin Cast the First Stone." Brooklyn, Dec, 7. There wu unusual Interest felt In the services at the Tabernacle to day, for several reasons. It was Communion Day, a large number of new members were to be received, and It was known that Dr. Talmage woulA announce his decision In the matter of the Trustees of the Tabernacle for withdrawal from tbe Presbytery because of Its persecution of the pastor and his people. After tbe opening services Dr, Talmage replied to the petition of tbe Trustees in a few sentences. He admitted the outrages complained of were grievous and hard to bear, but expressed his love for' and devotion to Presbyterianlsm, advised delay, and expressed his willingness to remain provided the persecution! cease. The following wag the sermon In full: SUBJECTâ€”DISPOSITION OF CHRIST. TEXT-Pblllpplans li., 6: "Let this mind be in you which was also In Christ Jesus." There Is nothing more desirable than a pleasant disposition. Without it we cannot be happy our selves and we cannot make others happy, When we feel that we have be n vexed an,d have lost our temper, or have been Impatient' under-tome light cross, we wake np to new appreciation of proper equipoise of nature. We wUli that we had been born with self balance. We envy the bear ing of that man who Is never thrown into pertur bation. We live under the feeling that as years pass along our character will be mellowed and ripened, and we will become more self controlla ble, forgetful of the fact that an evil left In our nature uneradlcatcd grows to more offensive pro portions, and that a transgression not cast out may become the grandfather of a great generation of Iniquities. It Is possible to have oar disposi tions all made over again. Because we do not believe this our dispositions do not Improve. A man says, "I am Irascible and I can't help it," or "I am revengeful and I can't belp It," or "I am Impulsive and I can't help It." You can belp it. We may have our dispositions mado over again evil uprooted, rlgr Implanted. If It is ever done at all, my friends, It will be by having the dispo sition of Jesus Christ set down In our nature. I shall this morning discourse to you about the dis position of the Lard Jesus. In tbe first place, the spirit or Jesus was a spirit or Ren Hon ess. I know that sometimes be made wrathful utterances against the hypocrite and the Pharisee, but for tbe most part His words and His demeanor were gentle and loving and kind and patient and Inoffensive and pleasant. When you consider the faot that be had an omnipotence with which he might have torn to pieces the as- sailers or Hi! character, it makes His gentleness seem more remarkable. Little children, who always shy off from a rough man, rushed Into His presence and clambered on Him until people had to tell them to stand back. Invalids, so sore with disease that they shuddered to have any one come near them, asked Him to put His band on their wounds. It was to very soothing. There was not a mother, with to sick and delicate a babe, that she was afraid to treat it In the Savior's arms. His footstep was to gentle It would not wake up the faintest slumber. Some rough people bustled a bad woman Into bis presence and said, "De nounce herl Blast heil Kill herl" Jasus looked at her and then looked at the assailants, and said; "Let him that is without alu cast the first stone." When a blind man sat by the wayside making a great ado became be had no vision, the people told him to hush up that he was bothering the Master; but ( hrlst came to wntie ne was anu sain to him. "What wilt thou that I do unto thee?" Gentleness of voice, gentleness ot bard, gentleness of foot. We all admire it though we may not have It. The rough monnlaln blui), the great scarred Headland loves lo loos aown into ine calm lake at its feet, the stormiest winter loves to meree Into the sunshiny spring, and the moBt Im nulslve and Dreclntate nature must be attracted by the gentleness of Christ. Tbe calmness of hie look shamed boisterous Gennesaret Into placidity. How little of that gentleness you and I have. Let us confess it. It is a tendency ol ouc door life to stroke our dispositions tbe wrong way. i ne tnun der of tbe world's scorn sours the milk of human kindness. The treachery, tbe extortion, toe igno blenesa of mean men take the emoothnor- s out of our nature, and we become suspicious and hypo critical, and stuck all over with nettles, and frowns come to tbe brow, and harshness to the voice, and blnntnees to the manners. Wbat an utler and almost unlverssl lack of gentleness. So that we do not know bow to talk to tbe sick, lo Ihe troubled, nor care for the poor. We have our words Of sympathy pitched on the wrong key. I had a sister whose arm was put out of ioint. and the neighbors came, and they seized bold of tbe arm and pulled mightily and pulled until her angulsn was great, out tne Done went not into tne socket. After while a surgeon oame In and with one touch it was all right. So we go down to our Christian work with so rough a band and so un kind and unsympathetic a nature that we miser ably fail, while some gentle Christian soul comes along and with one touch the ten llgamants are healed and the disturbed bones are rejolnted. O, tor something of the gentleness of Christ! There is more power In such gentleness, than in a life time of high pretention. The dew of one summer night does more good than ten Carrlbeat whirl winds. Still further: Tbe Spirit or Christ was a spirit of sell sacrifice, No young man ever bad opening before him brighter opportunities than opened before Christ. If He had chosen to follow a worldly ambition He might have gained fortunes of wealth in the time He spent tending the s.ok, With His power to attract men and ponulsilie Himself. He might have gained any official posi tion: No orator ever won snch plaudits he might have won from sanhedrim and Synagogue and vast assemblages on the seaside. No physician ever acquired such a reputation for healing power as Christ might have acquired If He bad per formed bis wonderful cures in tbe presence or the Roman aristocracy. I recite these things to you to show what Paul meant when he said: "He pleased not Himself," and to show you the splen dor of His self sacrifice. No human power oould have thrown Christ Into the manger if he had not chosen to go there; no Sitanlo strength could have lifted Christ onjthe cross if be bad not elect ed himself to Ihe torture. To save our race from the raspings and turmoils of Its guilt He faced the sorrows of earth and Ihe woes of bell. All moth erly, fatherly, brotherly, filial, self-sacrifice paling Into nothing before this extreme of Divine gen erosity. Suppose you, my bearer, by a straight course of conduct could win a palace, while by another conrseof conduct you might alvantage your fellow men, but finally would have to come to assassination which would yon choose tbe palace or aseaasluatlon? Christ chose the latter. Ob, bow little self sacrifice we have I Wbat la U? Wby, It is taking from my comfort and add ngto yours. It is walking a long Journey to save you from fatigue. It Is lifting a heavy weight In order that you may not be put to tbe strain. It Is the substractlon of my ease and prosperity that there maybe an addition to your ease and prosperity. How little of that spirit any of us have I Two lit tle ohlldren. on a cold day, were walking down the street, the boy with hardly any garments at all, and the girl In a coat that she bsd outgrown, and tbe wind was so sharp she said, "Johnnie, come under my coat." He said, "It is too short." "Ob," she said, "It will stretch." But tbe eoat would not stretch enough, so she took It off and put it on the boy. That was self-sacrifice, There was Christ taking off His robe for yon and me, beggared for eternity without Him, When the plague wu raging in Marseilles, and they were dying by seores and hundreds from It, tbe College of Surgeons decided that there must be a post' mortem examination in order that they might know how to meet and arrest that awful disease. And there was silenoe in the College of Surgeons till Dr. Onion rose and said: ' I know It it certain death to dissect one of those bodies, but some body must do It. and I shall. In the name of God and humanity I will do the work." He went home, made out his will, then went to tbe dissec tion, and in twelve bours died. That was self sacrifice that the world understands. Oh, the more wonderful sacrifice of the Son of God. Hi walked to Emmaus. Hewalked from Capernaum to Bethany. Hewalked from Jerusalem to Cal vary. Hnw far have you and I walked for Christ? His bead ached, His back ached, His heart ached for us How much have we aohed for Him? Let us tbls morning look over all the year of our life and see the paltry list of our self sacrifices, Not one deed in my life or in your life worthy tbe name, Still further: TheHpIrl I of Christ was a spirit or humility. The Lord of heaven and earth In the garb of a rustic I Ho who poured all the waturs of the earth out out of his hand bending over a woll to beg of a Samaritan woman a drink! He who spri-xt out the canopy of the heavens and set the ears for Ills footstool, lodging with one rilmon, a tanner I He whose chsrlot the winds are, walk ing with sore feel! Jostled as though be were a nobody I Purs'nod as though he wero a criminal outlaw I Nicknamed I Struck at I Hnll out Hashing the tempests, and yet sitting down with out any assumption, in the cabin by the dlsclplss, as though He bad done no more than wipe she sweat from His brow lo His father'! carpenter ibopl Taking foot of death off the heart of Lai arus and breaking the shackles against the grave month, and yet walking home with Mary and Martha as thougt he were only a plain citisen of Jerusalem going out to stay the night In the su burban village of Bethany I Omnipotence under a countryman's garb I Walking In common san dals, seated with publicans and slanen-l Ob, the hum'.llty or the Son of Ood I How little you and I have of It. We gather a few more dollars than other people have, or we get a little higher social position than someone else has, and bow we strut and want people to know Ibelr places, and cry out, "Is sot tbls great Babylon that I have built for tbe might of my majesty and tbe honor of my kingdom?" Wotnd to God that we might get something of the humility of Christ. Still further: The Spirit of Christ was a spirit of prayer. Prayer on tbe mountains; prayer in Gethsemane; prayer on the lake; prayer among theslck; prayer on tbe cross I Why, you cannot mention the name ot Jesus without blng obliged to think of prayer. - Prayer for little ohlldren: "I thank Thee, Oh, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Tboa but hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and bast revealed tbem unto babes," Prayer tor his friends: 'Father, I will that tbey be with me where I am." Prayer for his enemies: "Father, forgive tbem, they know not wbat tbey do." Prayer lor all nations: "Thy kingdom come," How little of that spirit you and I have. How soou our knees get tired. Who Is there that for len minutes can keep bis mind away from the store, Ihe office and tbe shop, and concentrate it In supplication? Wheie are the vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saiuu? Oh, we want more prayer In the house, more prayer In the nursery, more prayer in the parlor, more prayer in the social circle, more prayer lu the Church mora prayer In the legisla tive hail, more irayer among tbe young, more prayer among the old. Lord, leach us how to pray I We have not tested Its power yet, The very moment when the Diet of Nuremberg were signing ineeaiotinaigaveaenverance to tne trot estants, that very moment Martin Luther was kneeling dowu In his private room praying for the accomplishment of the oblect. Without anv communication between the dletol Nuremberg and the room where Martin Luttaer was praying fortbat grand accomplishment, Martin Luther rose from his kness with a shoul, rushed out into tne street, ana cneo: -we nave got the victory; the Protei-tants are free I" That was prayer get ting tbe answer straight from the throne. We need to pray like Daniel with our face toward the Holy uuy. we need to pray use tne BH.unan.sml ting our htart. We need lo pray ll?.; 'il, "Oh, wri-tched mau that. I am, wr-.Sj daiijer me? We need to pray likeStephe inglntote)aven. We need to prav like Cbrlnt. w.io first emntled all the life-blood out of bis heart, and then filled that heart with the sighs and the ufOanBand the wants ana tne agoD les or an generations. , "Cold mountains and the midnight air Witnessed the fervor of his prayer," Still further: The spirit of Christ was the spirit oi work, mere was not a lazy moment in all His life. Whether he was talking to the fish ermen on the beach, or preaching to tbe sailors on tbe deck, or addressing the rustics amid the mountains, or spending the summer evoningln the village, He was always busy. Shaving in the carpenter's shop! Helping the lame man to walk without a crutch I Curing tbe child's fits ! Providing rations for a hungry host I Always busy He was. Tbe hardy men that pulled out the net from Gennesaret full of floundering trea sures; the shepherds who hunted np tbe grassy plots for their flocks to nibble at; the shipwright thumping away In tbe dockyards; the wine makers of En-sedi, dipping up the Juice from tbe vat and pouring It Into tbe goat skins none of mese were nan so ousy as ne woose nanas ana bead and heart were all full of the world's work. From the day on which he stepped out from the caravansary of Bethlehem to the day when He set his oross in lis socket on the bloody mount, it was work, work, work, all tbe way. II la not so with us; not to with you; not so with me. We want me ouraen to ne ngnt tr we are te carry it; the church new soft if we are to sit in It: the work easy if we are to perform It; the sphere brilliant If we are to move in it: we religious service snort if we are to survive it. On tbe way to heaven, rock, us, fan ns, sing us to sleep, dandle on the tips or your nugers, nana us up out or mis austy world toward beaven on kid eloves and a silken sunshade I Let the martyrs who waded tbe flood and breasted the fire get out of the way while this colony of tender footed Brooklyn Christians come np to get their crown I Oh, for mo.-e of that Detter spirit wntcn starts a man heavenward, de termined to get there himself and to take every body else with him. Busy in the private circle, busy in tbe Sabbath -school, busy in church, busy everywhere for God and Christ and beaven, O, Christian toul, what bas Jesus done against thee that thou hsat betrayed Him ? Who gave thee si much riches that thou canst afford to despise the rewards of the faithful? At tbls moment, when all the armies of the earth, and beaven, and bell, are plunging Into tbe conflict, bow can you de sert the standard? I have shown you that the spirit of Christ was a spirit of gentleness, a spirit of self-sacrifice, a spirit ol humility, a spirit of prayer, a spirit of wora nve points, win you rememoer tnem ? And are you ready for the tremendous conclusion of the apostle: "If any man have not tbe spirit ol Christ, he Is none of His." Overpowering statement I Who can stand before it? Not I, not you; a id yet this subject ought not to throw any Christian Into a despairing mood. Thnngh we are all well aware of tbe lact that we have not these traits of character as Christ had them, yet I think we have the seeds planted In our souls.and the harvest after a while will come. Glory to God, you have the blessed beginnings In your nature, and, though you are painfully aware day by day of your shortcomings, 11 Is your earnest prayer: "Give me this spirit of Jesus!" Aim high I I would not this morning say one dis couraging word lo you. I really think you have some of the favorable symptoms of a complete and eternal recovery from this malady of sin. Watch! Pray! Study! Compare I On toward the prize I sheath not your sword till you have gained tbe last victory 1 Higher and hiirhpr till you reach the celestial bills I Crowns radiant ana immortal tor all the victors, but eternal death to every deserter I FOREIGN NEWS ITEMS.
