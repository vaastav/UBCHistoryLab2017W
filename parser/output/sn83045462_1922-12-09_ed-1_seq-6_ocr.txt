President Harding's address to the Congress yesterday was notable ior | the number of subjects touched upon , With constructive suggestions for I legislation. It was not merely a set-1 ting forth of problems confronting the country, but in the more important j instances proposals for solution of the' problems were advanced. Mo longer can it be said that tlio i administration and the republican I party are without a constructive program. In the second year of liis term ! of office Mr. Harding has given his; party a program, and realization of a substantial i?rt of it now is in the l ands of the republican majority in Congress. Of the recommendations contained in yesterday's message, those pertaining to transportation and related <|ueslions arc properly given tirsi place. If France inherited a devastated area from the war. the United States inherited a devastated railway system, and of the two reconstruetion of the American railways probably is the more vital to national life. President Harding recognizes that this is a problem which cannot he dealt; with in a makeshift way. It is a big problem, and lie tackles it with full (palization of its hugeness. Knowing that superficial treatment would serve only to aggravate conditions, he proposes a major operation. For the railways themselves he recommends the merger of lines into1 systems, a facilitated interchange of | f! "tight cars, the economic use of | terminals and the consolidation of j facilities. Regardless of offendings of j the past, he properly insists that the | railroads have a right to earn a fair return upon actually invested capital, and the government having imposed regulations which largely deprive them of freedom of action, he argues government responsibility to accord them a square deal. Unless tlfls Is done he foresees failure; of new construction, and without new copstruction lack of adequate transportation will soon become the most menacing of national Ills, r;ut proper earnings anu me uuiai-ilng of new capital will not alone constitute solution of the transportation problem. Assurance of continuous operation of the railways through removal of the possibility of recurring strikes and lockouts is vitally necessary to the welfare of the nation. To accomplish this he would strengthen the Railroad Labor Board or merge It with the Interstate Commerce Commission. and then would give this federal adjustment agency the power, which it now lacks, to enforce its findings. While this proposal will meet with opposition from the leaders of organized lalior. it undoubtedly has the support of well resolved public opinion. American sentiment tavors the largest measure of individual liberty consistent with the public welfure, ] and does not. as a rule, hold for the I compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes, but transportation is so essential to the life of the nation, and the certainties of suffering involved in a nation-wide railway strike so appalling. that the lieople have made up their minds that here is a case where the abstract rights of the few must give way to the necessities of the many. But they would not deprive railway workers of the right to strike without substitute assurance of* full and even liberal justice. Such assurance is contained in the plan which the President .recommends to Congress. and railway management no less than railway workers would be made fully amenable to the federal tribunal of adjustment. Consideration was given by Gen. Pershing in a recent speech to the possibilities of war abroad and of com munism in the United States. The peace movement has been strong, but not strong enough to leave a good general under any fear of unemployment. / > Congress never opens a session without the gratifying knowledge that there are a number of good ideas at hand to be worked out if it has the time. The Reclassification Heed. Civil Service Commissioner Wales yesterday, speaking before the National Civil Service Reform League in annual session in thi9 city, urged the adoption or reclassification principles as a vital need of the government service. Pointing out that the federal service is in a state of constant change as new duties develop, he said that complete reclassification cannot be wfftten on the statute books, but that a plkn should be outlined, broad classea defined, grades established and salaries fixed hv legislation. From no other point of view is the nedd of reclassification so clearly seen as that of the Civil Service Commission, which supplies the 'major part of the personnel to the departments and bureaus and maintains, as far as possible, a standard of efficiency. The commission can see the service as a whole, and it therefore discerns plainly the inequalities that have resulted Irom the patchwork of many decades, . A the over-lappings through new organisations. the injustices caused by emergency creations and development. No proponent of reclassification inthe government service has expected a perfect system to be at once or perhaps even eventually evolved. But the impossibility of a perfect system, of a permanent nature, should not prevent enactment of a law which establishes a rational system based upon equality of duty and compensation, which, in short, keeps the government service as a business organization, subject to the same rules which govern every progressive, well managed business institution. The Huuse of Representatives has passed a bill which provides u system that is believed will meet most efficiently the needs of the service. The Senate committee on civil service has upproved it. The measure now is pending before the appropriations commit-1 tee with a view to certain adjustments. It has been there long enough for details to have been worked out. and it should be put upon passage speedily, so that the system may be put Into effect with no further delay than the government calendar entails. Opposition to the specific measure thus far advanced along the legislative course should not result in the I complete failure of action. Library Circulation. A ftoe ? A# ..... I u tupssc v* vtctcu jtreuo mr other branch of the Public Library i has been established and opened In Washington. Iaist night's dedication in the southeastern section marked the second step toward making this j valuable institution veritably a "uni- J versity for the people." and. as the library's organic act states, a "supplement of the public educational system of the District." The Public Library of the District was created for the purpose of Riving the people of this community free use of books. It was designed primarily' for circulating purposes. Given an admirable central location it provided in its initial main building facilities that Washington had hitherto been denied, i Hut long distances sepuruted the ma-' jority of the people, from the source of supply. Despite this fact Washington has used the library to a great and increasing degree, and It has proved a must valuable factor In quickening the intellectual life and adding to the knowledge and information of the people. Kstablishment of branches in the schools widened the circulation and value of the book collection and brought the library directly !nt;o the schools system, as it was by enactment designed. This, however, left the adult population of the District in large measure unserved, owing to the fact that it was necessary to cover in some cases several miles to reach the collection. Eleven years ago a branch was established in Takoma Park, and It has served that section of the District effectively since. Now, after eleven years, the aecond branch is opened for the convenience and use of a population estimated at 40,000. Another branch la contemplated, and provision for the site has been estimated for. In the Mount Pleasant district, embracing a population aboqt three times as large. The wise beneficence of Andrew Carnegie and of those who are carrying out sympathetically his wishes in respect to the extension of library; facilities to the people of this country j has provided for the extension of the main library as rapidly as means are afforded for sites and maintenance. While it is unfortunate that advantage has not been taken of this opportunity more rapidly, it would seem now that the value of library branches has been so effectively demonstrated that the process will be hastened and the library carried generally to the people with branches in selected places, with reference to public needs and convenience. Circulation is the fundamental nrln ciple of the Publie Library. Branches are the arteries of the system, to carry the vital fluid to the extremities and to all parts of the community system. Washington, the capital, blessed with an exceptionally high degree of public intelligence, should have a model public library, a series of local circulating points through which this great store of books may flow constantly and with a maximum of use and. therefore, of value. When it is learned that many banks have failed because of "wildcat" promoters sympathy is felt for the eitixen who loses his savings. What chance has the ordinary intelligence against the purr of the untamed financial feline, when even shrewd %nd ex perienced business men permit themselves to be vamped? A11 that the user of oil and gas hopes for is that investigation will not create expenses to the companies that prompt the directors to increase the price. Kemal sees only one side of an argument. Xo matter what propositions the allies bring up he insists on talking Turkey. Clenienceau is broadminded so far as American politics is concerned. He rejoices In the fact that he has personal friends in both parties. Mr. Harding and the Cabinet. 'Opponents of Mr. Harding are slyly suggesting that three members of the cabinet measure up to the presidential requirements?Mr. Hughes, Mr. Hoover and Mr. Weeks. True enough. They are strong men. and any one of them would soon make himself at home in the White House. But no one of them is thinking of the presidential billet. All three are glvins Mr. Harding loyal support and j Identifying themselves thoroughly; with his administration. Why refuse Mr. Harding re domination on the record made, and put the standard Into the hapda of one of his A.M.11..1) \TM -?a at.. uiutni MS*

There were two members of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet of presidential size, and, moreover, suspected of a desire to supplant him in the party's leadership?Mr. Seward and Mr. Chase. But when the time came Mr. Lincoln was - f v - first and they were nowhere. Th< republican party stood on the record, and Mr. Lincoln had supervised the making of the record. < Mr. Blaine In 1892 contested the case with Oen. Harrison at the national convention, but lost. Oen. Harrison lost the election, but not as the result of the division In the cabinet disclosed by Mr. Blaine's challenge. He was the victim of the Homestead riot, which occurred during the cam palgn, but for which he was not responsible either aa man or candidate. Gen. Wood'i Decision. Gen. Leonard Wood yields to public duty, and will remain In the Philippines. This Is his notification to Secretary Weeks: The situation here is going to require my remaining- on Into the nest year. Reports of my returning 1st of January should not be credited. Do not see how I can leave before the legislature adjourns, and perhaps not until afterward. As I have stated before, the situation here must take precedence over all personal and university Interests. Am placing resignation In hands of university. When (len. Wood accepted the office of provost of the University of Pennsylvania he had but recently been defeated for the republican nomination for President of the United States, and doubtless private life appealed to him strongly, 15ut he was so exceptionally well qualified for the mission to the Philippines, that when President Harding tendered it he deferred to the | I president's judgment and went to the I arphipelago. As his service there has been thoroughly satisfactory to the administration and helpful to the Filipinos, his decision to remain is in the nature of ; a public benefit, and entitles him to great credit. That he would have servod well in the private field of education is certain. But equally certain is it that his larger usefulness lies in public life, and that he is placed noy so as to secure for the country the exercise of a liberal measure of Ills talents and the benefit of a wide experience. At Manila, a highly important billet, the country will have while Gen. Wood ! remains an official wholly competent | for his work, and a dependable man in all things. As soldier and civilian l he ranks with the best the country | today can boast of. I 'inert may lit danger of America's having too much money. Wealth I* always regarded as meaning peril to a republic. Liut it is undoubtedly safer for America to have money than for some of the war-inviting countries abroad. A Chicago court has been asked to Issue an Injunction against vamping. It is enough to expect the courts to regulate industrial troubles without asking them to go any further in efforts to control affairs of the heart. Russia likes vodka, but Turkey is abstemious. Should an alliance prove threatening, there might be a chance of splitting It by dividing the participants Into wet and dry factions. If the publishers of German marks had reserved a little space for advertising they might have made the I enormous circulation profitable. In Turkey drinking; has been confined to the wealthy: which shows the tendency of primitive nations to get I civilized the wrong way. ? i A. rather hasty departure made it impossible for the sultan to bid a fond farewell to all his wives. What the District of Columbia gets for Christmas is a five-million-dollar cut in the budget. Ireland now has a government of her own, with the privilege of treating it rough if she so desires. The cabinet crisis in Spain is proving even a rougher sport than bullfighting. t ii m ?

You wait a minute or two. The one Intrusted with your card returns with the Information that the senator will be right out or that he Is not on the lie or at present. In the former case, you pass Into the reception room and j sit down on one of the scats, sofas or whatever they call them.

Such, howaver, Is not the case. While It Is true that Senator France received i hundreds of men and women during the sessions just ended, It Is true that Senators Calder of New York and Fre- j llngliuysen of New Jersey had Just as j many. This was especially true dur- i Ing the period when the tariff was under discussion. It was no unusual eight to see Senator Calder have dozensiof men and women waiting for him, each eager to present his or her case, each anxious to get the rates they wanted; and the wonderful part of It was that the senator never appeared to be bored. He gave each one an audience and made a notation of the request. 

EDITORS SelAtion of Public Eleratori to Here Man's Hat Pnulea. Into a tired world, already far too rull of vital Issues and unsolvable problems, the mayor of Cleveland Injects another. He has Issued an official request to the male citizens of Ohio's metropolis to discontinue the practice of removing theiu- hats In elevators in municipal buildings in the Interest of comfort, conservation of space and efficiency generally. As an Issue on which to turn editorial guns, this furnishes no less wide a Held for argument, support and opposition than does ship subsidy or the eighteenth amendment. And. apparently, It Is Just one more thing on which the world will never agree, for the opposing sides seem to be quite hopelessly at variance. "It's a tradition of Cleveland. Ohio." remarks the Brooklyn Eagle, evidently with some faint, far-off remembrance of three-cent fares run-i nlng through its mind, this thing of j having its mayors "rush In where j angels fear to tread." Another writer ! in another large city observes that : "a queer thing to get excited about; Is the question whether men who chance to ride with totally strange I women In olevators should remove their hats or keep them on, yet a lot of persone do get excited about it"; and thereupon editors all over the country proceeu vu mnv k?i*3?. | Chicago colleague Is entirely right about it by getting duly excited. "Running a big city la a man'ss'.zed job." observes the Toledo Blade, and. It adds. "In some particulars, that of a fussy old woman." Nevertheless. "It Is one of the pleasant I things about municipal authorities that they can take time from distributing offices, refusing offices, dictating legislation, vetoing leglsla- j ff n. scolding janitors and policemen and electricians and pipefitters, answering complaints about Impudent park attendants and dodging requests for charitable subscriptions? It Is fine, we say. that they yet have leisure In whioh to decide upon matters involving the ancient laws of chivalry." Thus enters a new era, declaims' the Plain Dealer of the mayoral constituency. "Old customs psns away. Copybook precepta familiar In youth (hve way to new doctrines of what's what in social usage. With lids drawn tightly above tha ears, we shall rise to new levels of civic consciousness." While Mayor Kohler "may have thought he was gains to change mat ters" by hi* edict, the NathvllU Ban- j ner think* the chanoe* are against such an assumption. Nevertheless, the Albany News sounds a call tor! "hats off" to the Intrepid mayor, for, I after all, lie is right; "It's nonsense removing hats In office elevators." "What Is there about an elevator that should require the removal of the hat?" asks the Chicago News., "As a matter of fact, an elevator is! virtually as much a public conveyance as a street car, and much I cheaper to ride in. Yet men do not remove their hats when women entar street care. The fact that elevators travel a vertical course, while street cars go horlsontally, "can hardly account for the difference in the required etiquette." The Topeka Capital Is equally mystified over the unique position oocupled by the elevator In that regard and it looks In vain for the loglo of the thing. What reason can be applied to the problem argues against it, for-"when elevators are crowded, as they are apt to be. It Is an annoyance to everybody If hats have to be re-1 moved. The act of taking them off In a crowded place Is awkward. Elbows are jabbed Into backe. ribs and stomachs, and persons are sometimes i?e? with hand In ale. holding a hat! aloft and unable to ret down without doing bodily injury to the women or to their hats." The Cleveland News agrees fully. Crowded conditions do not "permit the carrying of hats at port, present or order,11 lt| says, and "Intelligence suggests that men keep their hats on and try to make room for women wishing to crowd In." Anyway, so far as cour- j tesy to. women Is concerned, what. It asks, "could be more idiotic than the pseudo-gentleman who removes his hat in honor of the ladles In a! crowded lift and then Wows tobacco! smoke In their faces"? The Boston Herald adds another ' T-I I in

^^??.SMMMMMMM L DIGEST complication. "If men should re- 1 move their hats when women enter : an elevator, should they remove them wheti the elevator has a woman opI erator?" It earnestly inquires. "A woman being a woman, why is not i the lady of the lever entitled to def- j. erence? Running an elevator Is as r honorable an occupation. Is it not. as j running a typewriter, or being a sec- ! ; retary. or selling wearing apparel, or j ] attending sewing bees?'' ' i The elevator, it appears, is one of j1 the few places that have stood out j: against the killing onslaught of ad- , vanclng femininity. "Women strl dently have demanded equal rights. !' nnd tlicy are getting them." declares the Cincinnati Times-Star. "They , can vote, and they also can stand in ! street cars, so far as most men arcconcerned. But the elevator re- | manned a place of chivalrous salutation. To remove the hat was an j easy method of shoeing medieval i respect for a woman. It Involved no , sacrifice of a seat." But even there ] a nw element ?u' Introduced, as the Hartford Times explains It. "It came . down to a rontest between chivalry i ! and efficiency, and efficiency won." i i "Making every square Inch count IB | no doubt a question of life or death I in the big cities." the Jersey City I Journal concedes. "But If the little , I amenities that give life color and flavor are to be sacrificed on the altar of the cubic centimeter, why not go the whole hog? If space is so valuable In a Cleveland elevator, why not save a few more inches by prohibiting shoes larger than sixes?" From the far-western viewpoint of the Seattle Times, the amaafng thing Is that the "gentleness and courtesy which prompts a man to show defer- 1 ence to a woman" should be so i prevalent ae to need chiding, and i "the inclination of the rest of the H country will be to congratulate 1< Cleveland Instead of condoling with i ita mayor." i1 But "Is it. after all," aske the Cedar ' Rapids Gazette, "a serious matter ; whether men take oft their hats in elevators or not? It may be that we are finding other ways of expressing our respect for women. To give them a larger place in the world 1 of affairs was a tribute to their i worth that exceeds all the fine amenities of the glorious days when knighthood was in flower." 1 Add Tragedies of Broadway.

I I ; ' The library Table BY THE BOOKLOVER. -\ consider that my decision to give books as Christmas presents this year Is supported by the best possible reasons. 81nce books mean more to me than anvthlna else. In making thoughtful elections of books as gifts 1 really give more of myself than In any other way. In choosing good books to give to others I pay them the highest of possible compliments. In sending a really fine book I also give something that will afford lasting pleasure. Therefore, say I, choose books for Christmas gifts. * * * * No Christmas' season approaches, with its annual reminder to The Booklover to search out the best of the season's publications to share with his friends, without his also recalling a story which, though old, is always opposite to such an Impulse. One before-Christmas season a group of chorus girls were planning their co-operative gifts. They promptly agreed that for Gwendolyn, who doted on dainty lingerie, they would get a silk camisole. For Madge, who was very fond of sweets, they Quickly decided to get a five-pound box of chocolates; but since she was getting somewhat stout from too frequent Indulgence in her propensity, they ??iccu mat uiey wouia neip out In eating the present. Then they came to Mayme. me splrituelle member of the group. Clarissa said that lately she had noticed that In addition to the murder mysteries In the Kvenlng Scream, Mayme had been reading Some magazines, and so, she proposed that they give Mayme u jook. nut Kloisc. Maymo s roommate, sjxike up: "No, we won't give Mayme 110 booa; why Mayme, she's got a book already.'* t The literary movement, variously called American regionalism, local color, or the spirit of home, as embodied In Action, is well illustrated In "Short Stories of America," edited by Hubert L. Ramsey, published last year. That the short story Is an Interpreter of the sectional differences of the L'nitcd States Is explained by Hamlin liarland, who said In "Crumbling Idols ': "The sun of truth strikes each part of the earth at a little different angle; It is this angle which gives life and innnite variety to literature.*1 The volume includes such old favorites as Bret Harte s "The Luck of Roaring Camp" and Hamlin Uarland's "Among the Corn Hows," showing the now banished frontier: MonWInrnn Smith's "Arrival of a True Houthern Lady," Illustrating the traditions of aortal heritage; "The Making of a New Yorker." by O. Henry, depicting city life, and "A Local Colorist," by Annie Trumbull Sloseon, Illustrating rural New England life. * tf * * The book just commented on consists in such large part of delightful stories that one is somewhat troubled also to And that it contains the ma:hinery of analysis and of study Questions that form the staple of a school text book. One cannot help wondering whether the result of the conscientious use of all this scholarly cquipmeht by teachers and pupils will help to a belter appreciation and love of literature, or whether the process of dissection and analysis will nut defeat the proper object of literary study. If instead of strengthening the appetite for reading and sharpening the appreciation such analysis causes a hatred of these and other stories of excellence, better never mention the subject of technique to young readers. * =* * * ! The recent literature of religious thought?not of theology, at present apparently a barren and untitled field ?indicates a constant effort to approach the religion of Je^us. He- j ligious thinkers are examining the j Findings of the sociologists and the j sociologists are studying constructively the problems of religion. One uf the most significant contributions to these allied studies is "The Reconstruction of Religion, a Sociological View," by Dr. Charles A. Ellwood. profe^3or of sociology in the University of Missouri. The author believes that the present crisis in the religious world has been brought about by the failure of existing religion to adapt itself to the two outstanding facts in our civilization? science and democracy. He finds that the need of the world is a more rational, vital and socialised Christianity, and that only a Christianity of this sort is equal to the task of saving civilization and harmonizing its .varring interests, classes, nations and races. His purpose is to show how the social sciences may help religion to build a better world. 1'rof. Ellwood s book is probably the ables-i and most stimulating discussion of .allirlnn l*> ite VmIq f In mnHapn 1 if? I that has yet appeared. It has attracted such wide attention that he has recently been invited to give a course of lectures before the Vale University Divinity School. Translations of his work will shortly be published in German. Italian ird Japanese. The practcial character of his contribution to reiigoius thought is attested by the fact that he has been asked to participate In the revision of the international Sunday school lessons. * * * * The Bookiover gets so much pleasure and profit from his own reading and so firmly believes that all may find in books the same enjoyment and-benefit. that he is somewhat disturbed at the thought of the possible encroachment on the exercise of the reading habit by the movie and the radio. Will the now silent movie, which will soon, no doubt, everywhere hsve a phonographic accompaniment of spoken drama or explanation, and will the radio, perhaps soon to be as common as the telephone, together makg read ins unnecessary and kill oil the readins habit? These and similar questions are raised and considered in a thought-provoking article on "Changes in Reading," written by the well known Newark librarian, John Cotton Dana, for the December North American Review. Mr. Dana vividly shows that this age has produced an increasing flood of print. He contends that it has now swelled into a tidal wave too mighty to be dammed up by any possible development of movie or radio. Examining with somewhat pessimistic eye some of the perils to our civilization, the writer stll concludes "that the one element lacking in all other civilisations and present In ours is print and its use. and that if our civilization Survives it will be because of the presence of that factor." In his paper Mr. Diana shows that this factor "grows in strength dally, and grows more rajlidly every year." and urges that it be studied with care, and that l conscious effort be made to use it as a saviour of our civilization. The whole article deserves a careful reading by legislators and educators, as well as the rest of us. . # * * A popular type of Action In recent years Is the story of the woman,' beautiful, of course, who establishes her fortunes and develops her character by losing, or rather throwing away, her chastity. Such stories, by three prominent authors, are W. L. George's "Urs^a Trent," frank Swtnnerton's "Ooqtiette" and Arnold Bennett's ressntly published novel. "Lilian." They and others of their kind are the direct successors of the eighteenth and ear y nineteenth century - novel, In drhich a prostitute is idealized, represented by Abbe Prevost's "Manon Lescaut" and Dumas Younger's "Dame Sua Camelias" ("Camille").'

/CAPITAL 1 BY PAUL V THE modern world love* a slogan. It puti pap Into anything to be able to boll down it* essence | into three or four words which leave nothing out. We hare "Do It now!" for the procrastinating business man. we neve "oaiety nrwi: - wis umi i hurst!" and "Don't hurt anybody!" for the trafficker. Now comes another which Is of great significance: "Eliminate Illiteracy!" That is practically what the Americanization School of Washington alms to accomplish. With more than 10,000 in the District who cannot. read, it has before It a great task, but 1 one the Importance of which cannot be I exaggerated. This school reaches adults?not children. The thought that It Is ever too late to learn Is all wrong. An adult will learn more rapidly than a child, and. In one year of instruction, a man who starts without the slightest knowledge of reading or writing, and who persists In study, learning ten wonda a day, may become quite adept in reading the dally papers and In writing simple, straightforward letters. This Is not an exaggeration. Ten words a day for S00 days gives him a vocabulary exceeding S.000 words, while the ordinary laborer gets along with about a quarter as many words. The edult has the advantage over the chtld In hi* comprehension, through his ex - ?e? .ka.aa perienre or me ana mur ui '? . entirely unfamiliar to the child. [ The American isatlon School doea for the Illiterate what the college extension and the Chautauqua courses do for the college graduate or the undergraduate adult?It gives opportunity, regardless of age. Vet, last year out of 10.000 Illiterates. less than 100 took advantage of the open doors. Here la a chance for good educational mle- , alonary workers to bring In the known illiterate! and help them to overcome their shyness. Last year a man over . forty years of age entered the school unable to read. Now he has learned hla ten words a day. can read the daily papers, understand current news, and write letters. 'There la nothing that any man or woman need to be ashamed of. If his youth failed to give him school advantages, provided he now ' uses the opportunities befora, him. An Illiterate may have ,a brain as bright as that of a statesman. Btalel Webster | once protested that hla own brain was not a perrenlal spring: It was a cistern I. and he could get nothing out of the J cistern until he put something Into It. < Fill up more cisterns and we mar find , more Websters?st least many One cltlxens of great usefulneas. 1 a * a * I It is amaxing what surprises come 1 In that line. I have In mind a young ; man from a Virginia farm, who seven years ago was believed to be so Ignorant that he was counted as almoat a hopeless moron. During the last , seven years he hss been reading a certain weekly magaslne of current , vanta tAiffhlr.* iinnn a.11 itnei and political problems. Last fall he 1 and certain friends of the previous years met, and he showed a breadth of knowledge that would have confounded many a college graduate. They demanded What had wrought fhe miraculous change, and his modest answer was that he got all he knew out of the particular magazine. That needs interpretation: The magazine whetted his thirst for information. so that in addition to it, he devoured the daily papers and such books as he could get. bearing on th# subjects that the magazine opened to his mind. He is still running the electric motors of a great office building. where he has sweltered for seven or eight years, but his information includes general science and ' politics. * - ' * d ? It is the greatest blunder of any man to imagine that there is an age beyond which he can not learn. That was shown by the soldiers of the A. E. F. after the armistice, while they were vxiiting transportation to ye- I turn to America. Thousands of ma- I ture men took advantage or special | arranpempnt* admitting them to i French and English colleges, where [ they took special courses in language, I science and literature, thus spending four to five months in study. It was : a much-prized opportunity, .but no j greater opportunity for them than is j the Americanization ?chool today for the 10.000 Illiterates and for the foreign-born here In Washington. * * * * If your Christmas package, carelessly wrapped and hastily addressed, bumps in collision with a hundred other packages, something may happen just like it does when your auto- 1 mobile collides wtih a coal truck. .
