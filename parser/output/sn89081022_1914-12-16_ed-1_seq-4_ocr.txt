OniCIAL FAFEB OF KAJTDXTOSX COVITTT AND CITY Ol" WHiZMAJK WILLMAR, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1914 The fact that the canvassing com mittee in the Queen Contest at the re cent Benson Exposition threw out the subscription vote of the Fergus Falls Journal has been commented upon ex tensively in the press, with so many inuendoes and charges of bad faith directed towards the officers of theand West Central Development Associa tion that we are led to make the fol lowing comments in order that the newspaper boys of the district may know the other side and if they feel so disposed remove any false impres sion which they may have unwitting ly created. a 10*1112 Loney BIdg. 11CI1 yOU know why. ^Vhen apart IBUNE 75 40 found necessary a few weeks before the contest closed to throw out votes represented by old stock subscriptions paid because it would give one or two counties an undue advantage. The canvassing committee, of which the writer was chairman, were obliged to pass on several questions relating to newspaper votes after the count be gan. The committee worked hard, we are sure every member of the committee did their best to be fair and impartial. The Fergus Falls Journal handed in a bunch of votes aggregating one and a quarter million, representing their subscription receipts since Sept. 1. This was the only daily in the district and the committee members as well as officials of the Association, who were consulted with, felt that Otter Tail county had in so many ways the advantage over all the other counties in size and population that it would not be fair to allow the daily in the (Copyrighted) house goes dark, °*yourbody goes wron KnOYf wny» The principle is the same. If a person would try to light the dark rooms by making more electricity instead of turning on the switch, you would call him crazy. This is what most people do with their bodies. They take everything and do everything to try and make apart of their body do its duty when it is really cut off from the source of supply. Pressure on the nerve caused by a subluxed vertebra (bone) of the spinal column shuts off this supply to the organ or tissue just as pushing the electric switch shuts off the supply to the light globe. I make no charge for examination and consultation. LEWIS E. COSS, D. C. CHIROPRACTOR competition. Technically this was an injustice to the Fergus Falls Journal, particularly as there was no way in which to separate the receipts for the daily and the weekly. But on the other hand to admit the vote was a moral injustice to all the other candi dates and weekly papers of the dis trict. Otter Tail county has a dozen weekly newspapers besides the daily, about twice as many as any other county in the district, and had the contestant really entered into the spir it of the contest and hustled as did the girls in other counties instead of depending on this "windfall" to carry her thru, she would easily have out distanced the other candidates and the contest would have brought the same benefit to the weeklies of Otter Tail county that it did to the weeklies of other counties. The small amount of cash turned in for stock and the small amount of votes turned in by the weekly papers of Otter Tail coun ty proves the truth of the above con clusion. If you were judge in a race, and one of the horses which outclass ed all the others were given the addi tional advantage of a half mile start in a mile race, what would you do about it? As it turned out, the Otter Tail con testant would not have won the con test even with the vote of the Fergus daily, but this was not known when the committee voted to throw out the votes. The people of Otter Tail coun ty have nothing to gain, either one way or the other, in nursing a grouch on this matter. North Dakota has appropriated $50, 000 for the purpose of erecting a ter minal elevator in the hope that it will help the grain growers of that state get a square deal in the marketing of their products. The Equity Exchange hopes to get the new elevator located at St. Paul. The Equity farmers gath ering at St. Paul last week was an en thusiastic affair and reminds one of the Farmers* Alliance which was so strong about twenty years ago. The movement is particularly strong in Chippewa county, and the delegation from that county had the Montevideo Boy Scout Band of fifty pieces with them to emphasize their enthusiasm. "From the first we had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. We never had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals, we never shall have, a large standing army. "If asked, are you ready to defend yourselves? we reply, most assured ly to the utmost and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves." The above words from President Wilson's message find a response in the hearts of all true Americans. Why Not? Prohibition prohibits when the gov ernment starts out to enforce it. It took "Pussy-foot" Johnson and others years to wake up the government to the fact that one-sixth of Minnesota is dry territory, according to the treaty of 1855, but it has got wise to the fact, and woe to whoever tries to make it otherwise. What is to prevent the people of this state from making the rest of the state dry also. They can do so if they wish.—Montevideo Leader.
