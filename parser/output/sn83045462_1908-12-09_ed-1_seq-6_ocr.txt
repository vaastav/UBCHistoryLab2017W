Congress !s asked to investigate rertaln t0 serious allegations respecting the Panama j .j eanal. Did or did not certain Americans ' Cfi share largely In the money paid In conc?i nection with the acquiring by this government of the propertv rights of the fr Panama Canal Company? ^ It is not a new charge, but finds its present interest in the notice given it by ^ the President in his letter to "William D. " 1 Foulke. An important feature of the matter is the fact that the democratic national m Cl] committee refused to father the story in C the recent campaign. It took the matter under consideration, but could not see its 1 way clear to use the material. On its as special committee of advisement was Sen- re ator Culberson, one of ins party's most distinguished lawyers. It Is to be as- t0 sumed. therefore, that the story as sub- ei ?

At any rat<\ the committee declined It, and the story was used by certain newspaj>ers, but made no Impression on the voters. ti Two of the names involved are those of hi Douglas Robinson and Charles P. Taft. tl Mr. Robinson is a brother-in-law of Mr. to Roosevelt, and Mr. Taft a brother of Wil- d< 11am H. Taft. Both are men of the high- w est standing in both social and business m circles. Mr. Roosevelt has spoken for d? Mr. Robinson in explicit denial of the th charge as relating to him, and Charles P. a Taft speaks for himself. Mr. Taft inti- jn mates that he may take the matter into m court for redress of the wrong that he w asserts has been done to him. In his letter to Mr. Foulke tihe President ' states that all of the papers in possession ^ of this government bearing upon the case are. and from the first have been, accessi- ^ ble to everybody with a desire to Inspect them. Many of them have not been printed because of their lack of interest ~? -'? w,,_ Ti..* maha ii.it. >.titi,1 run- ^ lor U1C puuiitr. BUL Uvrixg; iic*o wvts ? cealed, and all may bo examined at any ra time. The President's letter is almost in the tone of inviting an investigation. * This is not a proper matter with which ' to play politics, and if that consideration re weighed with those democratic committee- * men who would not indorse it for use in 01 Mr. Bryan's behalf their Judgment is to tfl be complimented. But now that the a presidential campaign is over, and the c* matter has been revived In the fashion re known, a formal investigation of all the h' charges that iiave been made might very well follow. The President does not fear w the suggestion, and of course the Prest- w dent-elect does not. Mr. Robinson is 01 probably serene, and Charles P. Taft, so far from fearing an investigation by Congress, is thinking of asking for one by Si the courts. If the charges are without n< warrant those who have made them will "T1 suffer severely in public estimation botih at home and abroad. Why not, in the te public behalf, probe them? , lo Deadly Weapons. w Representative Sims' bill to punlsli the pi carrying of deadly weapons more severely cc is excellent as a" cure for this evil as far c as it goes, but it does not reach the a' source. It proposes to declare every person?with certain necessary exceptions? 'n who carries, concealed or openly, a pistol, 1)1 bowie knife, dirk, blackjack, dagger, ^ elmpshnt or metal knuckles v?uvu?v| - ?guilty of a felony, to be punished on conviction by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than three years. That is just the kind of law that is needed, not only here, but elsewhere, to discourage s' the practice of carrying life-taking weapons. But as long as men can buy without check pistols, dirks, knuckles and the w like they will continue to do so, taking p' their chances on being detected. It is obvious that the likelihood of catching a 1 weapon-bearer is slight. Usually the pis tol "toter" who does not disclose himself by taking life is caught through an accident.- or he Is arrestejJ for some other w offense, and on being searched is found to l?e armed. By the very nature of the offense 111 it is difficult of ascertainment. It is, there- V1 fore, urgently important to strike at the 8* source of the evil, the vendor, whose show lt cases and windows are filled with crime- P causing implements, tempting the evilly T disposed, the hot tempered, the jealous and the revengeful. There will be no ^ real reform in this regard until the law ai puts this traffic under stringent regula- la tion. As Representative Sims had his measure outlined before the House con- s< vened. It included in its prohibition the offering for sale and selling of all weapons of the Interdicted descriptions. Until some sale-regulating feature Is added the n proposal stands merely as a move toward ? on increase of the ii inishment of the arun- ^ carrier when he is caught. If the magazine with which Mr. Roose velt Is to lie associated undertakes to share in all his newspaper quarrels, there are busy days ahead for its columns. Xord Alexis was compelled to retire ^ from his administration without even the p formality of sending a message to any branch of the government. 1 *** ' ig Party Leadership and Following. 8< The Richmond Times-Dispatch, like many another good democratic newspaper, is deeply troubled, Listen: el "Since Mr. Bryan will pass no self- ^ denying ordinance on himself, the opinion is overwhelming that new* and vigoroils leadership must arise which will make this perennial willingness of his permanently futile. Where can such ir leadership arise so properly as In the c< south? What is the democratic party today except th-* south? And what has southern democracy to learn or to expect c from Tom Taggart, Haskell and "Fingy" .s< Conners?" p Excellent, as far as it goes. But it does c not solve the problem. c Let us suppose a southern man of abll- tl Ity and character?and there are many a such?at last in the limelight, with his section solidly and resolutely behind him w in an effort to make the south the center of things democratic. His friends pro- " claim him the new leader, and the other t> sections are rotiiled. Let us suppose him ti accepted as Mr. Bryan's successor, and P nora?iat*d for President. Then what? c This man cannot be elected by the 1< south. He must add to her votes the .* votes of other states, and he aeeks them v whpre they have often been sought by o Other democratic nominees?in states where at one time his party was strong. a Let us suppose him turning to Indiana, a He finds Mr. Taggart his party's repre- d t entatlve there, and the state's member i" democratic national committee. I innot get along without him. Shall 1 et along with him? If he calls Mr. Ta art to his side for the campaign the s ance in case of success will run longt br Mr. Taggart will be worthy of 1 ire, and will demand his wages. He w ant to represent Indiana behind 1 irone. JLet us suppose this southern man tur ig to New York. There, stand Mr. Co ers and Mr. Murphy. Between them th >ntrol the democratic machinery of t ate. Without them this southern nu in do nothing. If he strikes hands wi tern it must be on their terms. Th now his necessities, and are not gent generous in driving a bargain. If 1 ins they must dispense the New Y"o itronage. If he refuses their terms h rntest is without hope from that day. ? bargains with them, and wins, he mu ?ep his word. This Is what the southern democra in learn, and should learn, from Ta irt and Conners and others of their kin s objectionable as iney art-. uit-.v ? presentative party men in their respe ve localities. They are indispensable irty success. The strongest and mo tractive southern man could no mo jt them aside as matters stand, and ho; i win. than Mr. Bryan could have dor r. Bryan accepted their assistance b Luse he wanted to win, but was hant ipped by it instead, and lost, partly b iusc of it. But had he turned aw; om them he would still have lost, for iat event they would have knifed him. It- is not so much a question of leade ilp, or where the leader comes from, ; is a question of following. The mo uinent and attractive southern man cou >t reach the White House with the aid icli allies as he would now have to a pt in New York, Indiana, Illinois, ai ?ewhere. The democracy in those state i a national factor, does not enjoy tl spect of the country. Reorganizatio om the ground up. is absolutely essenti success. It is certain to add to existii nbarrassmeqfs, but it is bound to com he life of the democracy demands it. A High-Pressure Object Lesson. New York yesterday had a demonstr on of the efficiency and economy of tl Igh-pressure service, recently installi lere. A blaze developed in a dow wn building in circumstances which, u ?r the former method of fire flghtln ould have required five alarms, sur oning at least twenty steamers ai 'moralizing the entire departme: trough the shifts occasioned by so lari turnout of apparatus. The fire occurri a large warehouse filled with lnflai able - materials. On either side of as a wholesale whisky house. H? le flames spread from the building igln a great conflagration would ha1 ;en almost surely the result. By meai ' the high-pbessure service, howevc le flames were confined to the fir ructure." The fire was literally drowni it, fifteen lines of hose being quick jt In commission with a water pressu inglng from 125 to 175 pounds. With ro hours from the first alarm the fl as conquered and all the steamers th id been summoned as an emergeni serve were dismissed save two th ere held for the work of pumpir it the water that flooded the cellar - le building. After It was all over, wi loss of about $20,000, one of tl llefs declared that there was no long lason to dread Are In New York, for id been demonstrated that It Is poss e now to handle six "five-alarm" fir ithln the high-pressure zone at one tlm hereas It would have taxed the depat ent previously *o deal with two at one This Instance of high-pressure efflclen lould be thoughtfully considered by Co ess with reference to the Dlstricl ;eds. It Is estimated that the local equl ent of this nature will cost $750,0( oubtless as much as that was saved ye rday in New York. Some day, if t! gh-pressure equipment is not install cally, Washington will have a fire th ill cost far more than the work ojected. Then maybe Congress will nvinced that it is false economy to wt >r a disaster to compel the provisio jalnst loss which common precautl is dictated. The hope of the busine terests of Washington is that the a opriation will be granted this winter lat they may be given the high-pressu aarantee against a great fire befo lother year has passed. The fact th le National capital has never been vl ed by a great conflagration is no assr nee that it will not be thus devastate uch an assurance would be given by t cpenditure of three-quarters of a millt allars to install a system of pipes frc hicli an extinguishing flood could sured within a few minutes after t jtbreak of flames anywhere within t jslness section of the city. Taft and Strenuogity. Judge Taft" Is getting a foretaste hat awaits him when he takes up t utles of the presidency. There will lany demands on his time, and on ariety of subjects. Fortunately he rong and amiable, and able and dlspos > meet all such calls. An ofhce-keepii resident is not for this day and hoi he neoDle want to see and hear t ilef magistrate, and whether he Is 'ashtngton or elsewhere, the sight of hi nd a word ifrom him often fit the pop ir program. Some Presidents will enji lis more than others, but all will su irlbe to the change. James Hazen Hyde has been going bar jot for the benefit of his health. A lari umber of people have been going wit ut some of the luxuries of life for tl snetlt of his prosperity. * "William Nelson Cromwell's portrai take him look like a poet. But no pc t'er had such a remarkable head f jmmercial detail. The Haitians will not be content un ley land somebody in charge who is j etermlned In having his own way i "resident Castro. It would be strange Indeed if the will: ;lg of time should find the "solid soutl did for Taft. It is said that Archbold smokes clga Ltes. But he does not use his senutori jrrespondenc? to light them. The President's Wide Scope. By his personal participation yesterdi 1 the proceedings of the conservatii digress. President Roosevelt gave furth roof of his interest in the welfare of t ountry. His speech before that bo< fated the case clearly and convincing] tead In conjunction with his message digress, also submitted yesterday, it d loses Mr. Roosevelt as the chief inspir Irtnal >o in hA w/.rlr of I kVtlUt tVfl V.V, AAA WUi n VI i v v. la ilia I i' nd restoration. That portion of the President's messa rhich relates to the preservation of t uresis admits of no logical rejoinder. 3 simply a statement of facts, and it oily to close the eyes to actual corn ions which undeniably menace the prt erlty of the country, and which if u hanged by means of hurmonious leg itive action by Congress and the stut brill in a few decades develop problei itally affecting even the economic 1 f the nation. The President's message, indeed, poir ifresh to the remarkable scope of 1 .ctlvlties and the vigor with which he a Iresses himself to questions of imp< of tance and Interest. In addition to matters i le of present heated controversy sucli as the * he treatment of corporations and the labor g- question, this message covers with inil tensity a wide field of earnest labor for !j r. the uplift and advancement of the people. ^ lis It is an epitome of his energetic, versatile *, ill nature and his capacity for seeing broadly ij he and at the same time acutely a wide 3 range of facts affecting the national Hfo- ^ n- 1 1 j n_ After the stir Rockefeller made by an- jj ey nouncing that he would vote for Taft, ^ he Harriman must perceive that any aptn proval he may feel concerning a public 3 th policy should be discreetly expressed. ^ P.y Insinuations that $3,000 apiece were paid i . 6 for Central American generals are assur- 5 edly calculated to arouse suspicions of r. unbridled extravagance.
