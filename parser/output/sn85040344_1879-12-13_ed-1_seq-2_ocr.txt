The Trade-Mark La tv Invalid. By deciding on Monday that the statute providing for the registry of trade-.narks and prescribing a criminal penalty for their fraudulent use is unconstitutional in whole and in part, the Supreme Court at Washing ton upset an extensive system of mercantile righ s at home, and abroad. The subject came before the court on a division of opin ion in the New York Circuit Court and an appeal from a decision in Ohio, A District Court in the w c st some months decided that the act for the registry of trademarks wr.a uaconstilutional, but no appeal was taken, and the patent-office: at Washington went on with us Work. The decision by the Supreme Court apparently cuts up the preeenl system by the roots. The ex isting law provides for the rrgtstry of trade marks at Was’ log ten on the pavment of a te of twenty-live dollars, and gives ihe owner of a trademark more efficient protec tion than is enjoyed even by a patentee. A liberal provision of the lbw allowed the privilege of registry to the trademarks owned by the citizens of any country which permitted registry to American rade-masks. Prior to the passage of the lav, the recognition of foreign tr sde-marks had been secured by tree tics with some European countri s, and conventions cov ering the subject have heen negotiated with nearly all European countries since 1870, whe ■ the present trade-ma-'k act was adopt ed. Go far as foreign and domestic rights in trade-marks are scoured by federal regis try they will be impaired by this decision, but it must not be overlooked that the right of property in trade-marks is recognized by the common law. Every trader and manu facturer has p. right, which the courts will protect, in the distinctive mark by which he designates his goods. The col lapse cf the special registry act for uacon smutionality, simply makss the protection of trade marks rao.-e difficult, but it does not deprive them of value, and the law still stands ready to guard customers against the fraudulent use of trade-marks. There will be a general interes-in learning thegrounds of this decision. The federal statute was i passed in the attempt apparently to aesim j Hate the rights of invention and trade-mark, 1 two widely diflerent things, and was cur rently based on the power given congress to provide for patent and copyright and to reeu’ate commerce. Many valuable trade marks ore owned by proprietors of medicines. For instance, Perry Davis & Sou own the right to nense Pain Killer by originality and long use, and the common law of F-ngland and America would prot-ct them, a® it would others, PocX-ET? are always ripe enough to pick FORTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, senate.

THE 

MESSAGE. Animal Communication of President Hayes. Read to Congress on Monday, Dec. 1. Fellow ( mzEN.s of the Senate and House of liEPEEsrs’TATivEs ; The members of the Forty-sixth Odng.-ess have assembled iu their first regular session under circumstances call ing for mutual congratulations and grateful acknowledgement to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most in teresting evmta w hich have occurred in our public affairs siuce my last animal message to Congns* are connected with the financial operations o’ the Government directly affecting the business interests of the country. Resumption. I congratulate Congress on the successful execution o' the Resumption act. At the time fixed, and iu the manner contemplate* by law, United Btates notes began to fc>e redeemed iu com. Bince the Ist <f January last they have been prorap: y redeemed on presentation, and in all Imsineiß transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand npoi the treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United Btates notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of c< in and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals depoiited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are ena bled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for our manufact ures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the Ist of July last to Nov. 15, to the amount of about 

IS'J.UOO.C'OO. Public Credit. Since the resumption of specie payments there has been a marked and gratifying im provement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government bear.ug only 4 per cent, inter est have sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pty off all of the national debt which was redeemable under the prose it lav s. The amount of interest saved aunu illy by the process of refunding the debt sine® March!, 1877, is $14,2117,177. The bonds sold were largeiy in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt, which matures iu less than two years, is $7112,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be re funded by the issue of 4-per-cent bonds, and by the reductiou of interest which will thus be effected about $11,000,000 can be an nually saved to the treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is re quired, which it is hoped will be provided by Congress daring its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the laet fiscal year was $40,988,- 912. Silver Coinage. The coinage of silver dollars since the pass age of tiie act for that purpose up to Nov. 1, 1870, was $45,(00,850, of which $12,700,544 have been issued from the treasury’, and are now in circulation, and $52,300,500 are still in the possession of the Government. The pen dency of the proposition for unx y of action be tween the United Btatee and the principal com mercial nations of Europe to effect a perma nent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subj ct The great tevivai of trade, in ternal and foreign, will supply duriug the coming year its own instructions, which may well be awaited be ore attempting furthei experimental measures with the coinage. ] would, however, sirougly urge upon Congress tiie tin pur ance of auth rizmg the* Secretary of the i rcasiiry to suspend the coinage of siivei I IXIW O LMiV’ *>■> J'tl *■••.* I *■*.. value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to main tain them at par with each otner if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is fwreed into circulation it will, if coined without iimit, become the sole standard of value, and tnus defeat the desired object, which is a cur rency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally-recognized money of the world. Civil-Service Reform. In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government, and expressed the intention of transmitting to Con gress, as early as practicable, a report npon this subject by the Chairman of the Civil Serv ice Commission. In view of the fact that during a considerable period the Government of Gieat Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses in various particulars analagotts to those present ed in this country and that, in recent years, the measures adopted weie understood to have been effective ami in every respect highly sat isfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elab orate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils sys tem in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the Parliamentary patronage, and of of ficial interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that, after long trials of various kinds of examina tions, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are car ried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established asopnditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate adminis tration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the ex tent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omissiou.of Congress to make any provis ion either for the compensation or the expenses of the commission, has been postponed until tiie present time. It is herewith trausmifed to Congress. While the measures of another Government are of no authority for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and then adaptation to our in iintiona and social life may commend tht mb > our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged ex pel it i.ee. lias opened my sense of the duty both f officers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils <t ud i e ilsof a partisan-spoils system of ap point i cut to office and office tenure are n >w generally recognized. In ’he resolutions of the ■area’ a ■ ios, in the reports of depa tments, in t;n- U.n des and proceedings of Congress, in the DP e-agoa of Executives, the gravity of these evils ha? been pointed out, ami the need of tl" ir reform has been admi’ted. To command the access- ry support, every measure of reft m must be based on common right and jus: ice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable an i essential in a free state. W hen the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and of the ad yisers who, iu accordance with our poiiti.’nl institutions, should bo consulted iu the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, is indispensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, ns well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties. It hardly need he pointed on. that very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in ofii ial position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is involved, and their best pub lic service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan polices. Their duties are the same w hatever party is in pow r er, and whatev* r policy prevails. Asa cons r -quence, it follows tha’ their tenure of ofli • should not depend upon the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quit irrespective of partisan interests. Ihe same consideration that should govern the tenure should also prevail iu the ap poimment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment a.- and removal is not a parquisi’e which may be used to aid a frientt or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised iu the public inte.est, under all the rauctions which attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for publ.c purposes. Every cibzen has an eon ; right to the honor and profit cf ecni'ag the public service of his cunatry. no on;y yi ground of discrimination ia the measure ni character and capacity he I. as to mo -a tea’ service most useful to the people Except in cas s where, npon just and recog nized principles, as npon the theory of pen sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards of past services, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the ap- j pointing power is held. In the light of these I principles it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequa’e meat s, especially fur every department and largo adminstrative of fice, where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not practicable for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointment and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depend, but of necessity to discourage al worthy aspirants by handing over appoint ments and removal's to mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the in terest of the people to bestow it upon him it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertaining person al fitness for office must needs be an important and permanent function of every tust and wise Government. It has long since come impossible in the grea f offices for these having the duty of nomination and appoint ment to personally examine into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlarge ment of civil service that proportion must con tinue to become less. In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were s few in number that it was easy for those mak ing appointments and promotions to personal!} ascertain the merits of the candidates. Party managers and methods had then become powerful agents of coercion hoe tile to the free and just exercise o! the appointing power. A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to Ihe desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President; audit has been im purpose to do what is within my power to ad vance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfac torj - to a free and intelligent people by a proper exercise of authority. It is in the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform, but it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operatiou on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally-accepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of departments are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundation must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adver saries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action an honor to his country. But the people themselves, far more than their offi cers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous admin istration. By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855. and now in substance incorporated in the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades in the great departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by the Departmental Beards of Examiners, were provided for and made conditions of ad mission to the public service. These statutes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity an essential to the well-being of the public ser vice. The important questions since the eu aetment of these laws have been as to tlie char acter of these examinations, and whether offi cial favor and partisan influence or com mon right and merit were to control the access to the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persona generally who might wish to bo examined. Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining hoards, subjecting even the exam iners to a pressure from the friends of the can didates very difficult to resist. Asa conse quence, the standard of admission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no com mon supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, in consistency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interest. A further aud more radical change was obviously required. In the annual message of December, 1870, my predecessor declared that “there is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor im posed oii Senators and Representative.-! as tha l of finding places for constituents. The pres ent system does not secure the best tlie public places. *The elevation and purill cat,on of the civil service ef the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole pe, pie of the United States.” Congress accord ingly passed the act approved March 3. 1871, “To regulate the civil service of the United ■states and promote the efficiency 7 thereof,” giv ing the necessary authority to the Executive to institute a civil-service reform. Acting under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure a system of just aud effectual exami nations under uniform supervision, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal npon the and -charge of their duties, prepared with au in telligent appreciation of the requirements of the s rvice, the regulations ccuteniniated, aud took charge of the examinations, aud who, in then capacity as a board, have been known as the Civil Service Commission. Congress for two years appropriated the money needed fur tin Compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of ihe commission. It appears from the report of the commission, submitted to the President in April, 1874, that examina tions had been held in various sections of the couutry, and that au appropriation of aboui $•25,000 would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties cf the commis sion. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April is, 1874, with the following favorable com men: upon the labors of the commission: “If sus tained by Congress, 1 have no doubt the ml* s can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service, aud relieve the Executive, members of Congress, aud the heads of de partments from influ nces prejudicial to good administration, 'i ue rules, as they have hith erto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the departments, and in that opinion 1 concur.” And in the annual message of December of th 1 same year similar view s are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing the work of ,the commission again advise i. The appropriation was not made, and, as a con sequence, the active work of the commission was suspended, leaving the commission itsel. still ia existence w ithout the means therefore of causing qualifications to bo tested in any sys tematic manner, or securing for the public ser vice the advantages or competition npon any extensive plan, f recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of the commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, unde.; many embarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in the executive depart ments in Washington, and in a number of tin custom houses and postoffices of ihe prim, i* -il cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity" aud efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Reports from the Secretary of the Inferior, from the Postmaster General, from the Post master in the city of New York, where sn b examinations have been some time ou tried, and also from the Collector of the Port, the Naval Officer and the Surveyor in that city, and from the Postmasters and Collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has in various ways contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree-, and that the general applicafion < f similar rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit to tho service. The reports of the Government officers in the city 0 f New York especial!} bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respect ive offices, showing that these examinations, and the excellent qualifications of loose admit ted to the service thr. *ugh them, have Had a marked incidental effect upon the persons pre viously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There tos been on the i/ait of those latter an increased inter est in the work, aud a desire to extend acquaint ance with it beyond a particular desk, and thus the morale of the entire force Las been rai- J The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to th< - cu niy investigate the scope and character of the tests, and the method of determining the results, and these visitors have, without exc* p rion, approved the modes employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion. Upon such considerations, I deem it ray duty to renew the recommonda tiou c deed In "my annual n -ago of Decem- I her, I-;;, requesting Congre.-s to make tho ccs. ; try appropriable i for the it sumption of j ;no work of the c ivil Service C nv, mission, i Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compensation to persons in the pub lic service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission as the Executive may direct. lam convinced that if a just and deflate test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service, and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and offi cial interference with tne proper exorcise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointee., which not July interferes with the due discharge of offi cial duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the view of several of my predecessors in the Presiden tial office, directly in accordance with the law if 1871 already cited, I endeavored, by regulation made on the 22d of June, 1 5 77, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It miy not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers. But, while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be ques tioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use tne authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Beasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppression of the pri vate citizen impose upon tne Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect con sidered, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free any other citizen to give his money in aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any othei citizen to refuse to make such gifts. It salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officers, it is gross injus tice to levy tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of the public funds. 1 recommend, therefore, such a re vision and extension of the present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation shall guard those who are faithful m its service. Popular Rights. The elections of the past year, though occupied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and complete establish ineut, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from inr people, both in the sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to Qualify th< opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interest of Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever destroy the zeal of our people in de fense of the primary rights of citizenship, am that the power of public opinion will over ride all political prejudices and ail sections' and State attachments in demanding that all wiver our wide territory the name and charactei of citizens of the United States shall mean om and the same thing,and carry with them unchal lenged security and respect’ I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all goot citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown, and which it is within its power to remedy I again invoke the co-operation o' the Executive and Legislative authorities of th. States in this great purpose. I am fully con vineed that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular righfs, no serious object will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country, or re tard the general diffusion of prosperity. I.ej-itl Tenders. The retirement from circulation of United Stales notes, with the capacity of legal tendei in private contracts, is a step to be taken in out progress to a lair and stable currency, whicl should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of the legal-tender i .per money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of th Government, extent in' extreme emerg enev, is without warrant in tho con stitution, and a violation of sound finan cial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private indi viduals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted peri- and of time after the ac complishment of this purpose was not contem plated by the framers of the laws under which they were issued. They anticipated tho re demption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment of tho obj. ct for which they were provided. The Suppression of Polygamy. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citizens of tiie Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and pun ishment of polygamy demands tho attention of every department of tho Government. This Territory has a population sufficient to en title it to admission as a State. Tho general interests of tho nation, as well as the welfare of tho citizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial form of Government to the responsibilities and and privileges of a State. This im portant change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah, in very considerable number, upheld a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with groat unanimity by Cougrt ss more than seventeen years ag •, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attend ing its enforcement The opinion widelypre vailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional guar antee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. Tho Su preme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding, as a rule of action, for all who resided within th< Territories. There is no longer any re ason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should he firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should be amended, and, in aid of the purpose in view, I recommend that more com prehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercisi ol th< rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the United Slates may be with held or withdrawn from those who’ violate or oppose the enforcement of tho law on tnis subject Foreign Relations. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, glowing out Q t the local laws of the maritime provinces, and the action oi provincial authorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to Amer ican fishermen Tho United Stales Minister in London has been instructed to present a de - mand for ♦105,305.03 in view of the damages received by American citizens at Fortune bay on the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the Brit ish Government, and an early replv is, au . licipated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examina tion, tho subject of our participation in tho provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government with a view to an early and permanent settlement ot the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to tho exportation of cattle to the United Kingdom. Home correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes, which has resulted in important modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion Government on the subject* in the interest of humanity and commerce. In accordance with the Joint resolution of the last session of Congress, Commissioue>-8 were appointed to represent the Luited States at the two International Exhibitions in Australia one of which is now in progress at Sydney’ and the other to be held next vear at Mel bourne. A desire has been -xpressed by mr merchants and manufacturers interested in the important and growing trade with Australia that an increased provision should lie made by Congress for the representation of our indus tries at the Milbourne Exhibition of next vear and the subject is respectfully submitted ts your favorable consideration. The assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the coast of Massachusetts of anew and independent transatlantic cable be tween France, by way of the French Island of St. Pierre and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject. The conditions imposed, before allowing tho connection with our shore to be e? abliahed are such a* to secure its competition h anv existing or future lines of marine cable, preclude amalgamation therewith ; to proving for entire equality of rights to our (, OT . ernment and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive posaeaaion of the privilege as ac corded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between Fra,, . and the United States which may be pr.. • •*, and accomplished by our citizens. An im portant reduction of the present rates of communication with Europe, felt to be too bur densome to the interests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this competing line. The attention of Con gress was drawn to the propriety of some gen eral regulation by Congress of the whole sub iect of transmarine cables by my pred ecessor in his message of Dec. 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of Congressional, action in tin* matter. The questions of grave importance with Spain, growing out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have been for the most part happilv and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the commission now sitting in Washington for the decision of private cases in this connection will soon be able to bring its labors to a conclusion. The long-standing question of the East Florida claims has lately been renewed as a subject of correspondence, and may possibly require Congressional action for its final dispositioi A treatv with the Netherlands with respect t. Consular 'rights and privileges similar to those with other powers has been signed and ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged on the filet of July last. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark are now in progress. Some questions with Switzerland in resard t„ pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that they will be arranged uimu a just and satisfactory basis. A question Vas also occurred with respect to an asserted chum by Swiss municipal authorities toexercise tun I age over the persons and property of Swiss ei : zens naturalized in this country. It is j issil tins may require adjustment by treaty. With the German empire frequent questions aii? i connection with the subjects of naturalization and expatriation, bnt the Imperial Qovertunet I has constantly manifested a dedro to strict!;, | maintain and comply with all 'reaty stipulations | in regard to them. In consequence of the omission of Cougrfx- to provide for a diplomatic representati a a - Athens, the legation to Greece has been with drawn. There is now no channelof diplomatic communications between the two countries, and the expediency of providing for one in some form ia submitted to Congress. Rela tions with Austria, Prussia, Itaiy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium continue amicable, and marked by no incident of especial impur of the personal head of the Govern ment of Egypt has taken place. No change, however, has occurred in tne relations between Egypt and the United States. The action of the Egyptian Government in presenting to the city of New York one of tin ancient obelisks which possess such historical interest is highly appreciated as a genorom mark of international rega and. If prosperity should attend (.he enterprise of its transport* tica across the Atlantic, its erection in a con spicuoue position in the chief commercial city of the nation will bo soon accomplished The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in'regard to the revision o‘ former treaties, it is now believed, will be fol lowed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity funds received some years since from Japan and China, which, with their accumulated in - terest, now amount to considerable sums. If -anv part of these funds ie justly due to American citizens, they should receive it promptly, and whatever may Lave been re ceived by the Government in excess of stnet ly-just demands should in some form be re turned to the nations to whom it equitably belongs. The Government of China lias signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration cf its subj. cts to cue United States with a dispassionate f&irnes. and to co-operate in such measure as mav tend 0 prevent injurious consequences to the I uiled States. The negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pressed with diligence. A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Loochco islands, the United States Govern ment has taken measures to inform those pow ers of its readiness to extend its good offices for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mu tually deem it desirable, and find it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and euerge ic ac tion of the mi itary commanders of the two nations on each side of the Uio Grande, miner the instructions of their respective Govern ments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and, in localities w here they wer* formerly destructive, have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain s confident expectation of the continuance of tin prevalence of quiet on the border of the twe countries. The third installment of the award against Mexico under the Claims Commission of July 4, 1868, was duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution iu pursuance of the a*-t of Congress providing for the same. This sat isfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our "rads with Mexico, and an increased ( ntributiop of capital and industry by our people to the dev< i opment of the great resources of that country 1 earnestly commend to the wisdom of Con gress the provision of suitable legislation look ing to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia :■ again fully restored by the arrival of the Min ister from that country to the United Stab - This is especially fortunate in view of the f<> that the question of an iuterocoanic canal lias recently assumed an important aspect, and is now nnd r iiscus ion with the Central A ei can countries, through whose territory tin canal by the Nicaragua route would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightened states,nß' - siiip on their part will see that the early pr s cudon of such a work will largely mure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of the United Stu • s, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that, should the work be undertaken under the pro tective auspices of tire United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way and its s cm Central Ameri ai erumente, tho capita' for its completion would readily be furnished from this country and Europe, which raig h failing -uch guarantees, prove inaccessible. Diplomatic relations will- Chili have also been strengthened by the reception of a Ministry from that country The war between Pern, Bolivia, and Chili still continues. The United States ha- not deemed it proper to iu’erpoec in the matter, further than to convey to all the Government concerned the assurance that the friondlv ofti ces of the Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will bo extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cor dial relations continue wiii Brazil and the Al gol.tine Republic, and trade with those coun tries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequc-t.- mail communication in onr ships betwo e i th ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve tho attend. of Congress as a;’ essential precursor of an i n | iurgement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela lias been followed by the establishment of a Provisional Q *TM omen! ia Go r< nun mi bat beep formally recognized, and it is deemed desirable to await tho proposed action of the people, w hich is exp* cted to give it the sar.cti of constitutional forms.
