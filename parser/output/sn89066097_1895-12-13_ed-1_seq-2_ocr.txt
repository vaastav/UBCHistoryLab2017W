- '-W THE WEEKLY GRAPHIC T. E. SUBLETTE, Proprietor. K1KKBVILLE, -FRIDAY, MISSOURI. 13 PEC. -Wall Street ami England have received the President's message with considerable favor. Football belligerents can not demand recognition until they quit battering their features be yond it. Let us be charitable toward the chronic loafer and kicker. No other man under the canopy is so pooily paid for his work. Those increased gold ex- poi ts may be in some treasure due to demands from Castellane or Marlborough for part of his whole some balance. The horse that won first honors at the recent San Francisco meeting is named Pepper. This i intended as a seasonable an nouncement. Judge Stcpp had the court room closed to minors in the pro gress of a late "loud'' trial at Eetbany. This seems to be a step in a good direction. Just at this time, when promineiit Democrats find no platform satisfactory, it is sad but not astonishing to learn David B. Hill has left the lecture field. The Congressional Kecord will be uncommonly interesting tc .Americans for a time, for the all sufficient reason that Lord Dun raven can not get into its columns. The Sultan may uo doubt feel secure as long as the rest of Europe continues to tike the ad vice of Lord Byron: Leaxe battles to the Tuikish hordes. And shed the blood of Scio's vine. There are a few men in the present Congress who are inured to hardships, and it may be that a few of them read the President's message in its overwhelming en tirety. "Charley's Aunt" has brought the author $150,000. If Charley's mother-in-law will now do as much the cynic will have to acknowledge he has been mistaken in the gentler sex. Missouri's Republican plu rality of last year was more far reaching than most persons sup pose. It actually made Benjamine F. Russell Sergeant-at-arms of the Fifty-fourth Congress. If the unspeakable Turk had someYankee ingenuity and a little Japanese imitation, some kind of new war-ship would result from the remarkable display of naval architecture about the Dar danelles. It would be like trampling the fallen if Kansas were to return Ingalls to the Senate in place of Peffer, besides Jeffersonian bipeds are likely to be too scarce for years for John J. to have a chance to exercise his skill in political taxidermy. Will Carletou pron ounced the President's message rather "tame.5' It seems that Will might find in it an inspiration to improve upon a former poetical ef fort, by putting some jingles into Columbia's mouth and naming the new candidate for public favor "Grover and I are out." An exchange of Populistic tendencies, rather than Democratic bias, announces that Jones of the Post Dispatch always gets what he goes after. If this is true, Col. Jones has certainly gotten all the "free silver'' he could find iu Mis souri, as it is very evident he has practically quit going after the white metal. If Sedalia wants the people of Missouri to respect its business sagacity to a degree that results in votes, it will hasten to contra dict that story to the effect that it offered the St. Louis Republic 10,000 to boom the capital re moval. Sleepy as Jefferson City is it would not Tor a momeut im agine the iuiluence of "Old 

ISOS" could be worth so much. Devotional organizations in Cleveland, Ohio, engaged in pray er on Thanksgiving day for the conversion of Robert G. Ingersoll. Perhaps it would not be irrever ent to suggest that, if the record ing angel laid those petitions aside, simply marked, "Prayers from Cleveland," the chances are good for their having been pigeon-holed indefinitely as some weak and in consequential foreign policy. Those esteemed contempo raries that spell the Vice Frcsi dent's name with nh instead of v may readily be pardoned. The "V" has been rather scarce since the present administration began to undo business at Washington. Unless those Cuban insur gents can manage to make the carnage equal to that of American football, they can hardly expect much sympathy, especially from men like Mr. Cleveland, who judge the merits of war by the de mand for substitutes. Tt is difficult to detect any element of doubt in the situation that makes Republican success next year less absolutely certain than a foregone conclusion. The portents of disaster to the party of the administration have been more uniform and decided than those that preceded the overturning of 1S92, and there is nothing in the history of this country to make void the obvious handwriting on the wall. The Republican sign board unequivooally reads, "On to Victory," yet it is not to be doubted that the Democrats will make a good fight in 189G. They always do iu Presidential years, and now they are going to have the opportunity to base party so lidity on extravagant criticism of a handicapped Republican Congress. It would be well for our represen tatives to remember that the sure thing is inseparable from prudence and sagacity. ALL 

AROUND US. Jo. Dill is at work on a souvenir edition of the Linn County News. Two of Brook field's papers have gone glimmering in the last few weeks. At a recent sale in Macon coun ty cows brought from 20 to 830, horses from $10 to 810. In its write-up of Putnam coun ty the Republic failed to give due credit to its Republican habits. The poor of numerous neighbor ing towns were substantially re membered on Thanksgiving day. A Macon county speculator ex pects to buy several thousand bushels of corn at 1G cents a bush el. Rev. Shawhau, the Kansas City revivalist, is engaged in a meet ing at Moberly, in which three different denominations co-operate. Randolph county has a citizen whose bare feet make a good imi tation of bear tracks. We forbear to comment. Body snatchers are sent to the penitentiary from Linn county. Such grave undertakings should prove disastrous everywhere. A Trenton hotel celebrated Thanksgiving day by moving up one story nearer heaven. The ex ception mocks the rule even in wicked Trenton. Young ladies of Milan lately had a coasting party and reported only one accident. The new wo man certainly flourishes in Sulli van county. Columbia law students want Ingersoll to address them at the next commencement, and the fac ulty wonders what in the name of Moses will happen next. A former citizen of Cameron visited Schlatter at Denver, and was treated or some knee trouble. The next day he laid aside his crutches and went to praising the healer. The air about Kansas City, St. Joseph and Trenton is heavily charged with railroad rumors. With so many ships at sea, the capitalists ought to make a car go- The Kansas City Court of Ap peals last week reversed the de cision in the Hess-Gansz libel suit at Macon and remanded the case for a new trial. Hess was origi nally given judgment for $750. The "petrified man"' brought down from Iowa was the first in dividual tried in the new court house at Lancaster. Hanging to gether well with cement and sup plied with an iron backbone, he was acquitted on the charge of be ing an administration Democrat. A negro at Columbia presented his church two pulpit chairs, which he named "King David" and Ezekiel.'' Later he was ex communicated, whereupon he stole the chairs, for which he was pros ecuted and acquitted. A bachelor editor in a distant town is on the verge of uiadnes because iu explaining the delay of an issue he stated ho had been "sleeping too close to the board ing house window," but the care less or criminal compositor left the n out of window. The Moberly Monitor is not sure that Cleveland could not car ry a single county in Texas in ISflG, as some Democratic organs maintain, but compromise the question by beiug positive that ho will not, which is equally glad tidings to the country. An interesting Announcement for our Readers. We have secured for the exclu sive use of the Weekly Graphic a series of articles on the Sand wich Islands by the distinguished historian and novelist, John R. Mu sick. These articles are being prepared by the author on the spot He is now at Honolulu, and will visit each of the islands of the Hawaiian group. They will have the peculiar living freshness that cau only be given to such when written it the place on the very days the writer beholds them. They will be a series of descrip tive and historical articles, or letters, about that country. Mr. Musick will furnish us, there'ore, articles rich in descriptive scenery, filled with authentic history and facts, and lightened by incidents of travel and adventure, making them more fascinating than a novel. No portion of the world is to day attracting more attention than the Sandwich Islands; aud yet, much as they are talked about aud much as they have been mixed in American politics for the last forty years, the masses of readers know but little of the social life and customs of the Islanders, and could not tell off-hand whether they lived in modern houses, in huts, wigwams, or caves. It will be the object of these let ters not only to briefly sketch the past and present of the Hawaiian Islands, but to carry the reader directly into the private life of the propie wno innabic mem; tneir past and present government, the overthrow of monarchy, and set ting up of a Republic will be nar rated from a non-political stand point. In this respect they will have a peculiar interest because in the coming Presidential contest the question of annexation will be agitated. These letters will con tain hundreds of items of great in terest, all told in a highly enter taining, instructive, and unbiased mauuer. In shoit, we have a rich treat for our readers for the entire winter. We urge you to get your neigh bors and friends elsewhere to sub scribe for the Graphic. The arti cles alone will be worth much more than the subscription price of this paper. Then always re member these letters are exclusive; no other paper in this vicinity can furnish them. They are for the Weekly Graphic. County Court Proceedings.
