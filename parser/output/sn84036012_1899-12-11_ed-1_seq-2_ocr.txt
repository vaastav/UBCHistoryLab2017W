SSTATE MiNE INSPECTOR The Annual Report Hae Beep Made. A THRIVING INDUSTRY It Gives Employment to 12,316 Miners. Forty- Nine Fatal Accidents. More- Mines in Op. oration. Special Dispatch to the Standard. Helena, Dec. 10.-The greatest of Montana's industries, mining, fur nished employment to 12,316 miners during tthe year ending Nov. 30, accord SIng to the report of Statt Mine Inspec tor John Byrne, made public to-day, of the mines that come under the provis ions of the inspection. In this vast army there were 49 fatal accidents, an Increase of dne over 1898. The report shows that more mines are in opera tion than when Mr. Byrne last re ported to the governor. The state mine inspector says the per cent. of fatal aceldents was 3.97in every 1,000 miners employed, as compared with 4.32 last year. The inspector deplores the fact that the laws of the state in relation to mining are deficient, and in order to have defects remedied he recommends the appointment by the governor of a commission to prepare a set of regu lations that shall define the responsi bilities of the mine owner to his em ployes, and vice versa, thereby protect ing the miner without placing an oner ous burden upon the employer. The report furnishes a vast amount of :n teresting and instructive information concerning the industry in general. The inspector refrains from reviewing the mines inspected in detail, because of the law passed by the last legislature providing for printing the reports of state officers but once in two years. He refers, however, in a general way brief ly to the development work in the dif ferent counties. "A comparison of the mining indus try during the year 1899 with previous years exhibits a marked improvement," says the inspector. More mines are in operation; a greater number of men employed; better methods and results in the mining, smelting, milling, cyan Iding, and the combination of those and other processes which are being applied to the recovery of values con tained in the ores of this state. The results of the improvements in this direction are of incalulable benefit to the chief industry of our state, for not only is the productive area of the reg ular producing lodes increased in con sequence, but several old mines, after a long period of inactivity, have again resumed operations and are yielding handsome profits from a class of ores that were worthless to their early operators. Plenty of Exploltlng. The copper, silver and gold ledgec were actively exploited during the year. The further explorations carried on in Butte district have developed no change In either the quality of the ores or the size of the lodes. On the con trary, they have been added to largely by discoveries made in developing new ground. The silver mince of Granite and Cascade counties are confronted -with a condition which has demanded 'from the officials entrusted with their affairs a thorough knowledge of the re apective local situations as well as the most intelligent economy in manage ment to keep them in operation. The price received for their product is so low that in order to realize a profit they are obliged to extract only the best grade of ores, except in instances where the medium grades can be ob tained in large quantities. On this ac count prospecting for silver, and n fact the development of the lodes of that mineral which are known to ex ist, has nearly ceased. Lewis and Clarke County. Lewis and Clarke county shows some improvement over last year. While no large discoveries can be recorded, some small strikes were made in the gold Debil ity, Weak= ness, lental and Physical Exhaustion. Cured by HUDYAN.

W.rito. producing districts. Considerable work is going on in the Rimini section, but it merits more attention from the min ing public than it has so far been ac corded. In fact when we view the many strongly mineralized districts that are to be found within the boun daries of this county we are at a loss to understand why prospecting has not been more thoroughly and systemati cally prosecuted. 1 am strongly im pressed with the belief that were a limited amount of capital judiciously expended in the development of these districts as good mines as have been found in the state would be uncov ered. Madison County. Mining in Madison county is pro greeossing with each year. The increased number of its producing mines and the many undeveloped and meritorious prospects that are to be found in all sections of the county assures the con stant growth of the industry. The number of men enga ,d in mining in a small way is much greater than in any of the other mining sections. Condi tions in this respect are most favorable to individual efforts, the ores being of a fair grade and the high mountain ranges being cut by gulches exception al opportunities are offered for the de veloping of the velns by tunnel. As a result of mismanagement the smelter located at Twin Bridges was a failure. Early in the present year. however, the company was reorganized and the plant remodeled to suit the ores of that district. The present company have ample capital and the gentlemen in charge the necessary experience to make a success of the enterprise. Should the old properties that have re sumed prove a success, and I am rea sonablly cohfldent they will, the pre cious metal output from that county will be materially increased and tho community in which they are located benefited by the employment of at least 100 in each mine. Fergus County. Fergus county has in its Togo sap phire mines earned the the distinction of successfully developing the first mine that produces precious stones. The quality of the sapphires found in this deposit, I am reliably informed, is equal to any on the market. The suc cessattending the operations of the Gilt Edge gold mines has revived interest in several of the partially developed properties of that district, capital has been enlisted for their further devel opment and plans are under way for their equipment with the necessary mining and reduction plants. Park County. The future for mining in Park coun ty is most assuring.. With trans.norta tion facilities the New World district I will compete in production with the older organized sections. The Be:,: gulch mines, In the Sheepeater distr-: have resumed active operations. De velopment is going forward rapidly and on a scale which will insure a heavy output. The milling capacity has been increased by the addition of a modtrn mill of 50 stamps with concentrating accessories. As a result of the suc cersful opening of those mines Intleret has been aroused in that district in a marked degree. Boulder and Inde pendence districts are also attracting attention and though but a limited amount of exploration has ,oon done, it has proven that many of the lodes can be profitably worked. Basin district in Jefferson county is actively preparing for the resumption of operations on a large scale. The property of the Basin & Bay State company is now equipped with a min Ing, concentrating and smelting plant, which comprises the latebt improve ments in the respective departments. The concentrator has a capacity of 500 tons per day and the smelter 150 tons. The various plants are provided with every necessary adjunct calculated to promote the largest degree of economy consistent with the highest fftelency. Systematic development is being push ed at the Hope mine. In the past op erations of this property considerable of the values were lost by reason of the method applied to their recovery not being suitable. Realizing this, the I present management have undertaken to repair the errors of their predeces sors in this respeot, and various tests are now being made on the quartz with a view to determining the process which will make the best saving of values. The success of the mine large ly depends on how much of the values contained in the quartz can be recov ered and the cost of manipulating the process employed in the act. Such a process must necessarily be efficient and comparatively inexpensive in op eration, because, while it Is true that large bodies of high grade ore have been encountered in the course of past de velopment, and no reason exists why as good bodies may not again be dis covered, yet the success or failure of the property rests upon the ability to utilize the immense body of low grade quartz found in the mine. Flathead County. Considerable advancement has been made during the year in the Lihby and West Fisher Creek districts of Flathead county. Besides the Snowshoe mine, which has been steadily producing, the Shaughnessy Hill properties, lo cated 10 miles south of Libby, were started. These mines were transferred to a strong company in the early part of the year. Since acquiring control large expenditures have been made in opening up the veins and in the erec tion of a concentrating plant. There can be little doubt of the success of this entepprise, as the property was subjected to a severe and thorough ex amination before the transfer was ef fected. Several of the gold bearing deposits on West Fisher creek have commenced producing, a 10-stamp mill Is already in operation and another is in course of construction. Both are Intended to treat the product of claims which can supply ore in sufficient quantity to keep the mills in constant operation. Broadwater County. The two principal producing mines of Itroadwater county, the East Pacific and the Stray Horse, have to a great extent exhausted the ore bodies in the upper workings. New tunnels are now in course of driving for the attain ment of greater depth on the vein. Lea.ers are taking out considerable gold ore from Ile properties of the Custer county and from Iron Age gulch, In the vicinity of Winston. A system of lee sing is also extensively practiced by thi. owners o' mining property in the IHassel and Radersburg districts. Il~scula County. Since the Iron Mountain mine closed down mining has bern carried on in ltisoula county in a desultory manner. It is hardly conceivable that a territory so marked in its mineral characteristics as that situated bitween Missoula and the Idaho rtate line can produc,. but one mine. It may not be out of place at this time to remind that class of mining men who are on the lookout for some prospoc-or to strike a good thing, and then buy in chrap, that there are more mines made than discovered. lfeagher County. The only mining to speak of going on in Meagher county is that being car ried on in the Castle and Copp ropolls districts. From t1hi foermer shipment, of lead silver ore li being constantly (Continued on Page slx.) 

'IECTIN OF ThE MINI Domestio Deposits Largest in Our History. HEAVY COINAGE OF GOLD The Mints Hard Pressed to Meet the Demands Made Upon Them-A Notable Change in Gold Stocks. Washington, Dec. 10.-Mr. Roberts, the director of the mint, in his annual report says: The mints and. assay offices operated upon more bullion in the aggregate and a greater coinage was executed during the last fiscal year than in any previous year. Original deposits of gold were slightly less than during the previous year, amounting in value to $143,497,190, against $147,693,194 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898. Domestic deposits were the largest in our history, amounting to $76,252,487, against $64. 881,120 in the proceeding year, but there was a falling off in foreign coin and bars. The coinage of gold was the greatest in our history, amounting to $108,177,180, against $64,634,865 in the preceding year. The stock of gold bullion in hand in creased from $96,688,682 on July 1, 1892, to $119,882,772 on July 1, 1899. The coinage of silver dollars from bullon purchased under the act of July 14. 1890, was $18,254,709, against $10,002, 708 in the preceding year and the coin age of subsidiary silver $9,466,87., against $6,482,804. The mints have been hard pressed throughout the year to meet the de mands upon them, the institutions at New Orleans and Philadelphia running over time for the greater part of the year. The pressure at the San Fran cisco mint was not so great because the stock of silver bullion at that institu tion was exhausted in August, 1898. An arrangement was made with the house of J. E. Seligman & Co. of New York by which 3.193,613 fine ounces of silver at Philadelphia were exchanged for an equal amount delivered to the mint at San Francisco. This exchange enabled the latter in stitution to coin the supply of subsi diary silver required on the Pactnc coast and to assist in the coinage of tne required number of silver dollars. This mint also converted into coin the full amount of its very large receipts ot gold bullion, its gold output being $58, 258,000. Mint Facilities. The mint facilities of the country will be taxed to their utmost until the new buildings under construction at Phila dl!phia and Denver are completed and equipped. The stock of gold bullion is accumulating and with the present pressure for subsidiary coinage cannot be reduced. Fortunately the large cash balance in the treasury permits at this time an unusual stock of bullion with out embarrassment but congress should at the approaching session make appro priation of a new Philadelphia mint. The building is well advanced towards completion and as the power pimnt and much of the machinery will require considerable time for construction, the contracts for the same should be let during the coming year. When the present charges for refin ing silver were adopted they were appli cable to the conditions then existing and the government refineries received a share of the business. But the cost of treatment has declined and the charges of private concerns have been reduced, while the government charges have re mained fixed. The effect has naturally been to send the silver bullion to pri vate refineries. While there is no good reason why the government should en ter into necessary competition with pri vate concerds, it is desirable that so long as It conducts refineries it should do so in an economical and business like manner. The report suggests that the charges for refining silver bullion be so, reduced as to put the government on an equal footing with private concerns in the business, or to such an extent as will bring them the amount of silver bull ion they require for the treatment cf gold deposits. The total gold imports of the year I mounted to $88,978,882 and exports to 530,550,783. The total silver imports were $31, 170,578, commercial value, and exports $rt.655,345. The stock of bullion in the mints and c may olites on July 1, 1899, was as follows: Gold, $119,882,772; silver (cost), $87, 875,898. During the year $1,168,951 in worn and uncurrent gold coins were received, with a. loss of $10.543, and $8,598,076 of worn and uncurrent subsidiary coins. NEW 

WAGE SCHEDULE. An Increase for Seventy-Five Thousand Cotten Mill Operators. Fall River, Mass., Dec. 10.-The new wage schedule, giving 75,000 cotton mill employes in this and other New England cities a 10 per cent. increase in wages, will go into effect to-morrow. On Dec. 18 an additional 60,000 mill employes will begin to increase a like advance in wages, and hbefnre the first of the year 10.000 others will have received the increase. Thus, by Jan. 1 fully 145,500 New England mill employes will be receiving a4n average rate of pay equal to the previous high rate of 1892, when they were paid the highest rate of wages since the inception of the cotton industry. ENGLAND'S NAVY Makes Her the Equal of All the Other Nations of the World. Paris, Dec. 10.-The Figaro publishes an interview to-day with M. Lockroy, former French minister of marine, in the course of which he says: "The British navy is twice as strong as ours. It is able to oppose simultaneously the nav!es of France and the triple alli ance. Where French fleets are stationed they are confronted by twice or thrice their strength. "France must have cables. Great Brit ain's bases of supplies are all connected and the British are ready for war to morrow, if necessary, with every nation on the globe." He Has a Mania. Bremen, Dec. 10.-Ernest Graube. who ePaault.d Herr Blreerman, one of the di rectors of the North German Lloyd com pany, severely wounding him in the head, confessed to-day to having previously as saulted four other persons, one of whom he fatally injured. For Penniless Consumnptives. Denver, Dec. 10.-The National Jewish Home for Consumptives, located in this city, was formall7 dedicated to-day. President Grabfeld.r of Louisville and It abbi 'tie or Denver deilveted th. principal dreses. The home was busk by the JeWtsh order of B'nal Brith, but is not intended for the 'care of members of that ordeo or rnce alone. Any one suf fering from consumption who is unable to pay for treatment ond carerin any other Institution Is admnooible into this one. It was constructed with the one idea of providing a'home for the penniless con sumptive. AN ALL 

WATER ROUTE, Immense Grain Elevators to Be Erected at Montre.al. Chicago, Dec. 10.-The Tribune says: William J. Connors of Buffalo has been in donsultation here with some of the largest grain shippers of Chicago re garding an all-water route for grain to the seaboard.. Montreal is to be the seaboard terminal of the route and a Chicago architect is now working on plans for 'the erection at Montleal of three .elev-a- j with an aggregate ca pacity of 9,00.,000 bushels. With theae elevators there is to be a fleet of nbw steamers which will be employed in. coast trade and carrying grain to Liverpool. Mr. Connors ex pressed the opinion that the project would be in .operation by July, 1900. He said: "I have the' support of all the large grain interests of Chicago and Duluth. The export men ha.ve expressed confi dence in s e practicability of the scheme.,. "It will be the seaports that will suf fer from the new route, New York, Newport News, Boston, Baltimore, Portland, Galveston and every port through which grain passes for export. It will .itmply be a contest between rail and water, and I am confident water will win." SHIFTS THE ISSUE. The Discussion Is Now For or Against the Gold Standard. Chicago, Dec. 10.--J. G. Johnson of the democratio executive committee to-day said: "The introduction of the republican monetary bills shift the issue before the f country. The discussion will be for or against the single gold standard. Instead of for or against silver, as it was in 1896. "The democratic party will maintain its stand In favor of free and unlimited coin age of gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, Independent of the consent of any foreign nation; in short, independent bi metallism. The discussion in congress over the republican caucus gold standard measures will be the beginning of the dis cussion which will be carried through the campaign." Bailey WIll Protest, New York, Dec. 10.-A special to the World from Washington says: Rep resentative Bailey of Texas is ready to protest against General Joe Wheeler's admission to congress should he re turn from Manila and ^;resent himself to .assume his ol>stion as rceresenta tive from Alabama. Mr. Bailey will contend that Mi-. Wheeler cannot -,old two positions-major general of vol unteers and member of congress--t.the same time. Mr. Bailey has made a canvass of the democratic side and re ceived promises of support from nearly 100 members, London Stock Exchange.

Berlin, Dec. 10.-The money market situation continues to be the chief con cern of German business world. Lon don exchange continued to rise all last week. Gold exports are now possible and therefore an increase in the bank rate is considered virtually certain. The officials of the Relecl.bank were in consultation yesterday on the subject, and there was a general sentiment in favor of an advance to 7 per cent. A definite decision is likely to be taken Tuesday. The Relohsbank statement j yesterday showed much less improve- I ment than is usual at this time of the year. Private discounts, after rising to a point near the official rate, eased off somewhat yesterday, but the rise in .the London private rate causes an expectation here 'that the Bank of Eng land will make yet another advance. Thus far, however, money market conditions do not inspire a .fear of permanent trouble in Berlin, a feeling of assurance arising from the fact that saturated with gold that any consid erable derangement is impossible. To-day a high finance authority gave the correspondent of the associated press an estimate of the gold in cir culation in Germany, placing this at 2,500.000 marks, and predicted that the industrial situation would continue very strong. A leading official of the Reichsbank explained that the indus trial boom had not yet reached its cul mination, but was now extending to the textile industries. "Iron prices," he said, "continue to rise. The syndicate of rolled wire manufacturers have advanced prices 10 marks a ton. A Franco-Belgian syn dicate, with a capital of $10.000,000 has acquired the Westphalia coal mine and intends to establish immense modern furnaces and steel mills on the Dort mund-Ems canal. A motion will be introduced in the reichstag concerning the organization of German chambers of commerce in foreign cities, in which particular German now lags behind." The packet post between the United States and Germany is a success. Dur ing the month of October 3,000 packages went from Germany and during the month of November 5,000, as against 11,000 during the whole of 1897. After kecping silence at first, the agrarian press now begins to make at tacks upon that part of President Me Kinley's message ,to congress relating to the joint, commission proposition. The Deutsche Tages Zeitung says to day: "Such a proposition Is wholly. unac ceptable. It is monstrous. Its outcome would be that 'the shrewd Yankees would bamboozle the German members of the commission about American meat with caldrons double bottomed and similar tricks, while the Amerl cans here would manufacture evidence against beers and 'wines. President MIcKinley's claims as to the healthful ness of American meats is preposter ous after the scandalous embalmed meat trial." The leading editorial of the National Zeitung to-day commemorates the forthcoming centennary of the death of Washington. Emperor William re turned to Berlin last evening and spent to-day with the imperial family at Potsdam. The report that Herr Rosser, formerly German consul at Apia. will become governor of Ger many's share of the Samoan islands is without foundation. He will soon re-enter the consular service with an appointment of importance. Gibson Won the Series. Cincinnati, Dec. 10.--The series of races between Harry Gibson, bicyclist, and Runiek, roller skater, closed last night at Music hall. Gibson won two races and the series. In last night's contest, which was an Australian lur suit race, Gibson caught Runlek after pedaling 11 miles and 17 laps.
