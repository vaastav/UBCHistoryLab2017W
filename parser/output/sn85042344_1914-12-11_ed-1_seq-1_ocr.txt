He became the first president of the re-organized Church, and held that office more than half a century, until his death. He was a coiisli. of Joseph Fielding Smith, In recent yesrs pres ident of the Latter Day Sulnls In Utah. The greater part of President Smith's life was a struggle, as had been the life of his father, to place Mormoniatn upon a sound footing I Hiring the last yearn of his life he was blind. lie waa born November 6, 1832. at Klrtland, O., where his father had gone two years earlier with a few followers, from Manchester.
