The Intelligencer thinks that "the Wheeling REGISTER will soon "become indignant over the execution of another member of the StfRR v? i family." If he shall be tried and convicted according, to law, we shall approve the punish ment Of JOHN II. SURRATT, just as we] would approve the legal punishment ol ( vitt s Xkw i.:n, Jim Fircison, Dan K vRNS WORTH, or any other notorious criminal. If. a? IwlleveU, Suuratt is one of the "oath-bound conspira' ors" tv.r the murder of Mr. Lincoln, we shall more deplore his execution, than we would b- vail the smldcu taking-oflf of those leaguers against the nation s life, to whose plotting* the negro-snffrage editor is privy.

An excellent and unanswerable argu ment in favor of the immediate restora tion of tin- Southern States to their eon ctitui ional relations with the Federal 0ov? rnnient is found in the report of the Secretary of the Trea>ury. Among the j.lans v t ieh the Secretary proposes for the iiui>toveuieut of the financial af fairs of the nation is the rehabilitation ot the Nitithcru States. He urges this matter upon the attention of Congress ? uli p eat deai in v* ami force. The re p >rt says: In alluding t" this subject. the Sec re- ] tan feels that in- steps upon dangerous ground. and that he may he charged | Vith introducing a political topic in a fmaueial report: but, in his opinion. tl? r-- w no question now before the ?'"UMry nmre imjiortant in its l?earing8 upon our finances than the jiolitical. ami i ";i>. i ti-iitly industrial status ot* ih? southern States. Embracing, as they do. one-third part of the richest lands of the country, and producing j articles of jjti.it value for home use ami for exportation to oth-t ?r countries, their position with i< :ard to the General (Government cau i remain unruled, and their indtis tr;.il pursuits cannot continue to l?c seriously disturbed without causing' ?> nh a diminution of the production of i their great staples as must necessarily affect our revenues, and render still more unsatisfactory than they now are our trade relations with Europe. As long as the present anomalous condition of these States continues ? as long as they have no participation in the Gov ernment. to the support of which they ar> compelled to contribute ? it is idle to expect that their industry will be restored or their productions increased. On the contrary, there is reason to ap prehend that, until harmonious rele tious again exist between the Federal Government and these States, the con dition of their industrial iutcrests will become day by dav more uncertain and unsatisfactory. There will be no real prosperity in these States, and cou w<jut>uuy uo teal prosperity in one - third part of the United States, until all possess again equal privileges under the Constitution. Can the nation l?e regarded as in a healthy condition when the industry of so large a portion of it is deranged! And can the labor question at the South he set tled as long as the political status of the South is unsettled T Can the na tional credit l>e elevated, aud the pub lic debt he rapidly reduced unless the Southern States shall largely coutriV ute to the public revenues! and can , such contributions bo relied upon as Ion# as they remain in their present dis franchised condition f W ill the tax payers of the North continue to be pa tient unless their burdens of taxation can be Tessenad by being equally shared by the people of the South f Regarded thus as a purely financial question, the relation of these States to the federal I'liion is an exceedingly interesting and important one, and as Mich it demands the calm and careful consideration <>t Congress. The questions the Secretary suggests are only capable of one answer. Tho nation can not he regarded as in a heal thy condition, the labor question at the Smith can not be settled, the national credit can not be elevated, nor the public debt rapidly reduced, uor will the tax-pavers of the North continue to be patient while ten States are excluded from representation, and fettered- with all the disabilities which radicalism has seeu tit to impose. Every man who owns one dollar in government securi ties is interested in restoring the South to that financial condition that will en able her to do her part in preserving the national credit. In her present un settled condition, a condition which the radicals are rendering worse and worse every day, it is impossible for the South to recover rapidly from the pecuniary distress occasioned by the war. ie Southern people ar* dispiriti aud discouraged. They ha\o n*? interest in maintaining the credit of a nation from all of what benefits they are rigidly excluded; they will uot willingly or cheerfully pay taxes for the support of a govern ment that denies them representation, and heaps upon them oppression and insult. We all remember with what zeal the raonied men of the North, the I bond holders of the government, labor- J ed for tho suppression of the rebellion , and, as they said, for the restoration of ! the Union. They knew that without : the preservation of the Union their bonds I would not be worth tho paper upon | which they were printed. They knew that the North alouo would never be able to pay even the interest accruing upon the national debt, and that the success of the Federal government was absolutely necessary to tho maintaiu ance of its credit both at home and abroad. Well, now, the course that is i being pursued by JJio radicals in Con gress prevents the South from paying' its portion of the national debt almost j as effectually a* if the independence of the Southern Confederacy had been | achieved. Under the radical programme, j the ability of the South to pay is al- 1 most as much crippled as during the I progress of the war. For all intents and purposes, finaucial as well as poli- j tical, the I'nionlias been dissolved 1>) j tho faction that controls the national j Congress, and there is very little left ol I the Union bequeathed to us by our fore- ; fathers except the name. Our national , finances must inevitably feel the effect J of the prostration of the South, and the holders of government bonds will do j well to prepare for tho depreciation which the continuance of radical rule ( will bring. Each individual tax-payer in the na- j tiou has also a direct interest ir. the immediate restoration of tho Southern States, and the settlement of the ques- i tions now agitating the people. So long as the South is excluded from represen tation, and ground to the earth by oner ous enactments, her people will be: unable to pav any considerable portion of the expenses of the government. ^ The deficiency in the revenue trom the South will be added to the burdens of tho people of the North, whose j own share of taxation is almost too J heavy to be borne. Nearly one-tliird of the nation is, by radical legislation, , prevented from bearing its proper bur den. and thus ilie taxes of the North are ; increased nearly one-third. "When tho j laboring man of the North pays three j dollars tax to the United States govern ment, one dollar of that sum is paid because of the exclusion of tho i Southern States. When he pays tho j exorbitant prices demanded for the necessaries of life, let him remember that one-third of the increase above the , price given for tho same article before the war is paid for the purpose of keep ing the radical party in power and pre venting the restoration of the I'liion.

CAUSE OF IRELAND. Pleaded by the Bbhtp of OrltMi, Bishop Berkeley. Kdwund Burke, Dr. Boyle, Iceland the Hi.lorinn, E.ord .TIncanlay and Sidney flnaith. "I come here," said the Bishop of Or leans, "to plead the catiso of the tin fortunate, and not to embitter your : thought*." j "This canse is so just, that I would i plead it before my adversaries them i selves, if I could have any adversaries in sncli a cause. I have none. "It is not a political cause; it is not even th4 cause of religion which Iain here to defend." ''Eternal thanks he to God, aud 1 6 the dignity of our nature, there is here below a region more elevated than that of human politics; it is the region in which every one, with the heart of a man, respects loftiness and purity, mis fortune, and the victims of unmerited outrage." "There are here below causes, if not greater, still more pressing and impera tive in their day, than even the most important religious controversies. Snch is the catiso I come to 1)10.0(1 Itefore you." "Therefore you will perceive that even the indifferent interest themselves pro foundly in this question, and that is the explanation of the present pious ardor and the motive-power of this immense concourse.

IRISII. J The Bishop of Orleans, drawing at tention to facts which are in the main well known to all in this country, says : "There are some who have dared to say, and to repeat of this race, energetic 1 and strong, but oppressed and condemn ed to sterile and unproductive soil, that its poverty, and the miseries of its na tive country, were due to itself and the idleness of the people." "Look at the Irishman in America, where his laud is his own, where his cottage is his own, where there is no threat ot eviction to paralyze his efforts, I where lie is sure of the fruits of his toil! What courage! What constancy! What energy ! A laborer leaving Gal way a year ago. was asked why he went into exile, ((ialway /Vr##.

(See Parliamentary licport.) j 1' or my part I know nothing on earth equal to it. "Well, brethren, these are the men who die of hunger !" TESTIMONY OK IIISHOP BERKELEY. j So long ago as 1731. the celebrated ' English Bishop Berkeley, one of the! best informed and most 'logical of the writers of his country, wrote : "I ask whether there be upon earth any Christian or civilized people so beg- ' garly, wretched and destitute, as the the common Irish: and if, nevertheless, there is any other people whose wants may lie more easily supplied from home 1" An illustrious warrior, the Duke of Wellington, with that accent of general I compassion which, as the Bishop of Or- 1 leans remarks, is the inheritance off their valor, proclaimed in our own age j in the English House of Commons, that "there never was a country in which1 poverty existed to so great a degree as in Ireland." STATEMENT OK TIIK It T. RKV. DR. DO Y I.E. i Dr. Doyle, the Catholic Kisliop of Kildare, as a witness in an investiga tion ordered l?y the House of Commons, said : "It is a frightful state of society; and whenitisconsidered.it fills one with, so much pain and horror that I have ' frequently prayed to God, if it were His will, rather to take me out of life than i to leave me to witness such evils." OtMMESTS OK THE EDINIlfRGII REVIEW.' This great organ of intelligent public opinion in the metropolis of Scotland, commenting on the words we have qnot- j ed from Dr. Doyle, said : "A thousand statements to the same effect might be produced; but, unfortun ately, they are not necessary. The pov erty and wretchedness of the Irish peo- j pie are too glaring and obvious to he called in question. They are admitted, by every oae who has ever l?een in Ire- 1 land, or conversed with an Irish gent Io nian. or read any book having any refer- : enee to that country." I.F.LAXD, TIIE EXGI.ISIf HISTORIAN, avows that in his time the extermina tion of the Irish race was the avowed end of the legislation of his country to- j wards Ireland. LORD M ACAt'LA Y, one of the greatest writers of England in our days, an eminent historian, who! was tlireo times a member of the ad ministration. twice sat as a cabinet min ister, and as the reward not less for his ability, than for the distinguished ser vices he had rendered to his country, j was made a peer of the realm, used this terrible expression : 4'Tbe harshness of those odious laws f was aggravated by a still more odious administration: for bad as thelegisla-i tors were, the magistrates were still worse." At the beginning of his history he said: "It will be seen how Ireland, crushed by the domiiiAtion of race over race, and of religion over religion, continued it is I true a member of the realm, but a withered member, which all who fear and hate England, point to with a fin ger of scorn. TESTIMONY OF SYDNEY SMITH. Sidnwftroitb, who, besides being one of the iMpt celebrated writere of mod em times, was also an Anglican canon of St. Paul's Cathedral, said: "Such jobbing, such profligacy, $o much direct tyranny, such an abuse ot God's gifts, syoh a profanation of God's Eie for the purpose of bigotry and ty spirit, cannot be exceeded in the i *y of civilized Europe, and will long remain a monument of tbe infamy and shame of England. * * * The great misfortune of Ireland is that .the mass of the people have been given up for a century to a handful of Protes tants, by whom they have been treated as Helot*, and subjected to every species of persecution and disgrace." DEFINITION OF COMMON RIGHTS. Sidney Suiith-adds : "The sufferings of the Catholics have been so loudly chanted in the very streets that it is almost needless to re mind our readers that, during the reign of George the First and George the Sec ond, the Irish Roman Catholics were disabled from holding a toy civil or aiil i itary office, from voting at elections, from admission into \ corporations, and from practising law or physic. A youn ger brother, on becoming a Protestant, might deprive his elder brother of his birthright ; by the same 'process, he might force his father, under tho name of a liberal provision, to yield up to him a part of his landed property ; and if an eldest son, he might, in tho same way, i reduce his fathers fee simple to a life ! estate, and even from holding long lea*c*. * * * And any person might take his Catholic neighbor's horse by paying for it. If the child of a Catholic father became a Protestant, he was ta ken away from his father and put into the hands of a Protestant rela tion." The same writer says that "the spirit to which this legislation gave birth yet remains." INDUSTRIAL RE8TR ICTION8 IN IRELAND. Of all the injuries to Ireland those which weighed down her commerce, ! manufactures andagricultnrc are among ? the worst. They were lasting fetters : and hindrances to the recuperative pow | ere of her people. And in tho right to I labor frfecly and dispose of the products i hus created are centred Hot only the ma terial prosperity of individuals and fam ilies, but the means of advancement, and in many cases the power of resist ance to vice and criminal temptations. Until 1699 Ireland had a foreign com merce in cloth of her own making. The Hritisli Parliament, fearful of this com petition, presented an address to Wil liam the Third, begging him to suppress this branch of Irish industry. "Wherefore," they said, ''we most humbly beseech your most sacred Majesty that your Majesty would be pleased, in the most public and effectual way that may be, to declare to all your subjects of Ireland that the growth and increase of the woolen manufactures j there have been, and will be ever looked ] upon with great jealousy by all your ; subjects of this kingdom, and, if not ? timely remedied, may .occasion very j strict' laws totally to prohibit and sup press the same." The King answered that, "he would do all that in him luy > i to discourage the woolen manufactures of Ireland." Soon afterwards, acts were passed, the object of which was to oblige the Irish to send their wool to England, where it was manufactured. No colonial product was allowed to enter Ireland before it had. been re shipped in an English port. These restrictive laws have long c? ased, but the result was to establish j trade iu unnatural directions, and pro duce results from which Ireland has not recovered. "When the capital of in dustry, commercial currents, priviligos, arms, and strength, have been carried elsewhere, they are not brought back in a day." AGRICULTURE AND LANDLORDISM IN IRE LAID. "Irish Catholics do not possess their country. Under Elizabeth and Crom well ten-ole ventlis of the Irish soil were wrested from the Catholics and divided among Protestants: hence to-day, the enormity that E iglish and Scotch Pro testants, who fo''in nearly a sixth pait I of the population, are masters of seven eighths of the land." THE PRESIDENT'S MES SAGE. Opinion* of ihr I'm*. [From tin- Xexv York World, Dcru.) The only question connected with the restoration of the Union which has any remaining vitality, is the .admission of the Southern members. The President adheres to his former views with resolute, indomitable stead iness, but with the calmness of con scious strength. Hoth the tone and tjie arguments of the Message, on this leading topic, are I excellent. In dignity, decorum, and chaste simplicity of language, few mes- j sages ever sent to Congress have been more creditable. [From tin* Xi w York Siu>. Ind. Rep] i The document bears evidence of care ful and thoughtful preparation, is dig-; nitied in tone, able in argument, re- ' spectful in language, yet firm and deci sive in the opinions express**! upon mat ters of national concern. While the President clings tenacious ly to his old position on the reconstruc tion question, there is a marked change j for the better in his manner toward j Congress. His views are presented with j marked courtesy and respect. There is an entire absence of that arbitrary dis-j position which he too often manifested , last winter in his relations with Con gress. [From the Kcw York Xewn, D>'in.) In its treatment of questions of im-i mediate domestic interest we are a lit tle disappointed. It i9 carefully writ-; ten ? in one sense of the word perhaps ! too carefully: that is, with a caution 1 that is suggestive of timidity. We hoj> ed for a firmer and more emphatic asser- ? tion of the Executive policy, and the j expression of a more resolute antagon ism to the position of the revolutionary party in Congress. {From the Philadelphia Age. Item.) It is a calm, temperate document, and the positions are stated clearly and argued with great force. The position of the President npon j the question of reconstruction and rep n?entation will be eminently satisfac tory to the true friends of republican j liberty in the nation. The line formerly drawn by the Pres- 1 ident between himself and the Radical party upon this vital issue has been again marked out with unmistakable ! distinctness, and the contest is now. j State rights and constitutional repre mentation, on the one hand; and on the other. Congressional usurpation and na tional consideration. [From the Pittsburg Chronicle. Rati.) The President employs no violent language, and casts no imputations np- ! on the integrity of Congress, but he de clines to abandon his own convictions, j He expresses the desire for "harmony ! between the co-ordinate departments of the Government." but he is unshaken in his opposition to the proceediogs of the Legislative Department. The message is dignified in tone, and unsatisfactory in matter. The opportu- 1 nity offered the President to regain pub lic confidence he has chosen to decline. To those who wish him. well, and 'who still desire to believe in his sincerity, it will bo a source of regret. I From the Pittaburg Dispatch, Bad. J While it is by no means as good a document as it might have been, we can truly say the recent message is much bettor than we had expected. Whilst we find in. it a reiteration of the views he has heretofore expressed upon the subject of reconstruction, and none ot the "olive-branch" which some prophe cied, it|is clothed in more temperate language than has recently character ized the utterances of its author. [From the Pittaburg Poet, Dem ] The message of President Johnson to the present Jacobin Congress, is. like all of his productions, plain, sensible and practical ; and is so brief that it will insure its general perusal. It is moder ate in tone, giving no evidence of a de sire for a disagreement with Congress; but still its chief point is a decided ar S anient in favor of the admission to ongress of loyal representativ?s from the Southern States. [From the Pittsburg Commercial. Rad.] The President's Message to Congress is al>out what we expected it to bf , both in the subjects that it embraces and in the tone that pervades it. Restricted by the necessities of the case, it ex hibits little that is either new or start ling in our National affairs, our condi tion happily not affording occasion or material. The returns of the October and No vember elections do not seem to have reached him, and he is oblivious to the fact that the appeal he made to the peo ple against Congress has been decided against him ? nnless, indeed, the sub dued tone of the President is to be taken as showing that he fully compre hends all this. [From the Rultiraoro Sun, Dem.) The President's message is a temper ate and conservative document in every nsspect, treating of the political situa tion in a calm and consistent manner, and reflecting perspicuously and sue- 1 cinctly the condition of our domestic and foreign affairs. Singularly temperate and respectful 111 the expression of his opinions and forcible in the arguments and illustra tions with which he supports them, the President leaves Congress no excuse for factious hostility, lit' is content to dis- j charge his duty, to lay before them as | the Constitution requires his opinions 1 of policy and right, and to leave with ! them the responsibility which belongs, to them. [From the Raltimore Gazette, l>em.] j The message of President Johnson , will disappoint alike those who ex-j pected it to be written in strong lan guage and a defiant tone, and those who believed that tbe result of the recent j elections would induce him to make concessions to the dominant party. The i prevailing tone of the message is calm, j but firm; presenting but few salient points and discussing none of the issues in dispute except those of the relations of the Southern States to the Union, and of their rights, as coequal members of the Union, to representation in Con gress. [From the Cincinnati Commercial, Rad ] It is, perhaps, sufficientto say that the message indicates no change in the President's views on the subject of re construction. There are some assertions in the opi n ing passages of the message, touching the placable and obedient spirit of the Son'h, and tlio decline of animosities engendered by the war, from which we have reluctantly to dissent. We only wish the cheerful faco put upon mat tort* in that quarter could be sustained by testimony. Asa whole the message is a fair State paper, clear, compact, and elegantly phrased. In the last particu lar it differs as widely from the Presi dent's speeches, as the finished periods of Webster from tlio mouthings of a ranting stump orator. [From the Cincinnati Gazette, Rad.] Johnson shows his obfuscation by talking of the rebel States a.s being in and not out of the Union, its if this de cided the question whether any terms of restoration could be imposed. But if ho means that because the rebel popu lation and States aie in the Union they are liable to no penalties for rebellion except through the civil jurisdiction, he makes all his reconstructions of the State governments illegal, and convicts himself of the grossest usurpation. If the war subjected the rebels to any terms, it subjected them to such its t he United States shall see fit to impose for the purpose of disabling rebellion and placing the Government in loyal hands. ( From Bwher's Rural Truths.] Immortality of liOTr. I never saw a man who did not believe in the immortality of love when follow ing the body of a loved one tot lie grave. I lu?ve soon men under other circum stances that (lid not believe in it, but 1 never saw a man that, when he stood looking upon the form of one lie really loved stretched out for burial, did not revolt from saying: "It has all come to that; the hours of sweet companionship; the wonderous interlacing* of tropical souls; the joys, the hopes, the trusts, the unntterablo yearnings ? there tliev j all lie." No man can stand and look into a cofhn upon the body of a fellow creature, and remember the flaming in- 1 telligeuce, the blossoming love, the whole range of divine faculties, which | so lately animated that cold clay, and 1 say, "These have all collapsed and gone."' No person can witness the last sad cer- 1 emonials which are performed over the i remains of a human being ? the sealing of an unopenable lid; the following of the rumbling procession to the placu of burial; the letting down of dust into dust; the falling of the earth upon the hollow coffin, with those sounds that are worse than thunder, and the placing of the green sod over the grave ? no per ton, unless he be a beast, can witness sliese things, and then turn away and bay, "I have buried my wif.*; I have j snried my child: I have buried my sis ter. my brother, my love." God forbid that we should bury any thing. There is no earth that can touch my companion. There is no earth that can touch my child. I would light my little breath and strength away before I would permit any clod to touch them. The jewel is not in the ground.
