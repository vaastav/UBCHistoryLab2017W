ANNUAL MESSAGE ANNUAL MESSAGE OF THE President of the United States TO THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS At the Commencement of the Third Session OF THE FORTY-FIFTH CONGRESS. rfbw-ritSzcniof the Senate acd noose of Represea- Oar heartfelt gratitude In due to the Divine Be ing, who haUia in His hand the dcttne of J'av tione, for the continued bfowal, during the laat year, of ennntlese blestins upon oar country. W are at pcoe with all other Nation. Our pub lic credit has rrcatjy Improved, and Is, perhaps. Bow stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have rewarded lW labors of those wbo till the soil; oiir mami'acturiDff Industrie re revivinr. and It Sa believed that general prosperity, which has been ao lour anxiously looked for, is at last within oar reach. The enjoyment of health by oar people generally has, however, ben interrupted durinjr the past season by the prf ralence of a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions of the Southern fitatea, creatine an eroenrency whirs called for prompt and extraordinary measures of relief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the I-ower Mississippi, soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by frrl tlvee from the Infected cities and towns and did not disapjN-ar until early in November. The States or-Ijoulsiafia, Mississippi aud Tennessee hare suf fered severely. Abont one hundred thousand cases are IWIeved to have occurred, of which, abont twenty thousand, according to intelligent estimate, proved fatal. It la impossible to esti mate with ny approach to Accuracy the lost to the onn try occasioned by this epidemic. It Is to be reckoned by the hundred mfliioun of dollars. The auffuriiiK mid destitution that resulted, excited the deepest n mprtthy tn all parts of the Union. Phy sicians an! i.urscs hastened from every quarter to the asahvar.ee of the afflicted communities. Volno tary contributions of money and suppllc, in crery needed form, were speedily and cenerously fur nished. The Government was able to respond in some mraetire to the call for help, by providing tents, n.cii'ires and food for the ick and desti tute, the rcuulsitc directions for the purpose hing given, in the confident exitectatlon that this action of the Executive would ceire the sanction of Concrete. About eighteen hundred tents and rations of the value of about twenty-flre thousand dollars were sent to cities ai-d towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to CongrcM by the proper department. The fearful spread of .this pestilence has awakened a very general public sentiment In favor of National sanitary ad in in nitration, which shall xot only control quarantine, but bare the sanitary superviai m of internal commerce in time of epi demics, and hold an advisory relation to the State mad municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers the public health, and which the municipal and State authorities are unable to regulate. The National Quarantine Act approved April 29, 187ft, which was paascd too late In the last session of Conreas to provide the means for carrying it into practical operation, dur ing the past season, is a step In the direction here indicated. In view of tho necessity for the most affective measure, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protection of oar seaports, end the country generally, from this and other epidemic, it is recommended that Congress (five to the whole sub ject early and careful eons) deration. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens In every civil and political ritrht continue to be of paramount interest with the great body of our peo ple. E very step in this d i rection la wel comed with pnbllo approval. and every interruption of steady aud uniform progress t the fes:n-d cot mo iu in at ion awakens general on ee!rte and a ide-spread condemnation. The re cent Ciicr'n oual elections have furnished a di rect and trust worthy test of the advance thus far mrie in the practical establishment of the tight of sulfrajra, secured by the Constitution to the liberated nice In the Southern RtHtee. All disturb ing Influences, real or Inninnary, had been re moml fnou all of these Stat. The thn-e constitutions! Hinendmenta, which con ferred fr tlom and eq'jalitv of civil and .political Tights u.t!i the coloreti people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent (etion of the great Innty of cimmI citizens who maintained the authority of the National Government and the lutetrrity and penetnit.r of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life. & a wine and necessary embodiment in the orpir.nr law of the Just iwults of the war. Tlie people of t'ie former slave-holding States aecepted fheee result- and gave m every practicable form awiTuncc that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments snd laws parsed in pur aufince tli'Ti-ftf, should, in good fjith, le enforced, rigidly and impartially in letter and spirit, to the end thnt the humbicst citizen, without distinc tion of race or color, should nndor them receive foil and enal protection in jeion and proiertr nod in pohtfeal rights and privileges. By these coiitirtitfonal amendments the 6o tit hern sec tion of Vu- I'nion obtained a large increase of po litical powr in Conirress and in the Electoral Col leire, and the country Justly expected that elec tions would proceed, as to the eurrancbiwd race, upon the 'mi me circumstances of leffal and consti tutional freedom and protection which oltaned in all the other States of the Union. The friends f law and order looki-4 forward to the conduct of these elections as offering to the general Judjnenr of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which the right or suffrage could he xereiwd by the colored people, and would be re epeeted by their fellow-citizen?: but a more gen oral enioyinent of freedom of suffrage by the col ored people, and a more Just and generous protec tion of that freedom by the communities of which the? form a part, were peuerally anticipated than the record of the elections dipeloses. In some of those States tn which the colored people have been vmabte to make tbeiropinions felt in the elections, the result mainly due to i patiences not easily measured or remedied by lejral protection; but In the Slate of Louiniana aid South Carolina at large, and in some particular (.'engross! on al dis tricts outMde of those States, the records of the election ecra to compel the conclusion that the rirhts of the colored voters have been overridden, nd tbelr participation in the elections not per mitted to w either general trr free. It will le for the Congress for which these elec tions were held to make such examinations into their conduct as may be appropriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the Ex ecutive and Judicial Departments of the Govern ment, eaeli in Us province, to impure into aud pun ish vloiatious of the laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I aaid Id this connection in my last mesAajro, that whatever anfbonty rests with me to this end I eh all not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the Legislatures, the Courts, ti e executive authorities, and the people of the Slates where these wrongs have been per petrated, to givethcli' assistance toward bringing to Justice toeoffenders, and preventing a repetition of thecriMc. No meaue within my power will be a pared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and to secure the con wo Hon and Just punis.iuu nt of the cuilty. It ib to ol -served that the principal appropria tion made for the lepartnicnt of Justice at the lat eeslou contained the following ciaue: "And for defraying : he expenses which maybe incurred In the enforcement of the act approved February 28, lb71, entitled. 'An act to amend an act approved May 13, 170, eutitled An act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United St'des to vote in the several Slates of the Union, and for other purposr-s,' or any acta amend atory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion oi the Attorney General that the expense of theee proceedings will largely exceed the nmouM which was thee provided, aiid I rely confidently npon Conrres to make adequate ap propriatiuna to enable tho Executive Jepaxtmou to enforce the la we, I respectfully uc upon your attention that the Congressional eleciiocs, ir cxerjr district, in a very Important Mfne, are just a fuatter of political in terest snd concern througiiout the whole country, tach Stute. every political party, is entitled to the ahare of pwer which ia conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is the right oi every citisen, poKHertbing the qualifications prescribed by law, to cast oue uutntimiduled ballot, and to have Ids ballot houeotly counted. So long ad the exercise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically, aa well as formally, eubmi&doD to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, aud all the departments of Govern ment will feel the true vigor of the popular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative tnteresta of Government, however urreiil or weighty, will ever displace the zoal of our people tn defense of the primary rights of citizenship. They understand that the protection of liberty re quires the maintenance, in full vigor, of the manly methods of free speech, free prea, and free suf frage, and will eiutaln the full authority of Gov ernment to enforce the laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights.

The corierMndeiic uuu this ub jeet will be laid before oi. The rpanii-h (Jtiverntueiit has officially annonncf d the tennination of the insurrection in ruba and the restoration of peace throughout that i-dand. t.'oii fident exi-ectatiops are expressed of a revival of trade and nir.iy, which it is earnestly hojied nny prove well foiinib d. NuiiM-nms ciaiims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restora tion of projtcrty have len amou the incident of the lon:-cont)uued hostilities. Some if these claims are In process of ailjustment by Spain, ami the others arc promised early aud careful cuuhid eration. The treaty made with Italy, in regard to recipro cal consular piivilcgea, haa bceu duly ra tilled and proclaimed. No questions of grave importance have arisen with any other of the European Powers. The Japanese Government baa Iwen desirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign Powers as re'ate to commerce, and, It is under stood, hits addressed tc each of the treaty Power a requetd to open negotiation with that view. The United States Government has leen Inclined to re gard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon trado with Japan are found injurious to that people can not but affect Injuriously Nations hold ing commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of aecluslon, baa within the past few years, made raitd strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not unreason ably, is looking forward to the time when her re lations with the Nations of Eune and America shall be assimilated to those which they bold with each other. A treaty looking to this cud has leeu made, which will be submitted for the couaidera tion of the Senate. After an interval of several years the Chinese Government has again sent envoys to the United States. They have been received, and a perma nent legislation is now established here by that Government. It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both Nations in promoting friendly reiations and removing causes of differ ence. The treaty with the Saiuoan Islands, having been duly ratified and accepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey and soundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occupation aa a naval station, if found desirable to the service. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico, correspond en e has been opened aud still continues between the two Governments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to en danger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles ou the border, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Kio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with Instructions, haa done much to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other aide of the river is also making an enerceiic move ment against the maraudinr Indian tribes. This Government looks with the great est satisfaction upon every evidence of strength in :be National authority of Mexico, and npon every effort put forth to prevent or to pim. sb incursions upon our ternary. Reluctant to bmi me any action or attitude in the control of these incur.dons, by military movements across the iMirder, not imperatively demanded for the protec tion of the Uvea aud pmiierty of our ow u citizens, I shall take the earliest opportuuity. consistent with th proper discharge of this plain duty, to recognize the ability of the Mexicau Government to restrain effectively violations of our territory It is proposed to hold next year an International Exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of tiie agricultural and manufacturing pro ducts of the two Nations will tend to better under standing and lucre; wed commercial Intercourse be tween their people. With Bratl and the Republics of Central and South America, some steps have been taken to ward the development of closer commercial inter course. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colombia aud with Bolivia. A boundary question between the Argentine Republic aud Par aguay has been submitted by thoe Governments for arbitration to the I'resident of the United States, and I have, after caretui examination, given a decision upon it. A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira Rivers has brought back information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. A like ex pedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic ami consular ottioera. In relation to the development of our foreign commerce, have furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stim ulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our people. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury fur nishes a detailed statement of the oieratiniis of that department of the Government, and of the condition of the pnbllc finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 187. were 2.r7,7G3, 678 70; the ordinarv expenditures for the same period were $'J3ft.904.32ti So. leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $.10,799.5 "1 i0. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending Jnne 30, J879, actual and estimated, are as fol lows: Actual receipts for the first quarter com mencing July 1. leTS. $73,39.743 43: estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters of the year. $191,1 10.V..rt 57; total receipts for the current fiscal year.actual and estimated, if Jo4.MK),000. The expenditure for tlte same period will be, actual and e;imated, as follows: For the quarter com mencing July 1, actnal expenditure, $73, 344,573 27; nml for the remaining three-quarters of the year, lite expenditures are estimated at $1 Wi,755,4'-ifl 73 making the total expenditures $'.M0,10,00; and luaviug an estimated snrpius revenue, for the year ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000, The total receipts during the next fiscal year, enning Juue 3. 1SS0. estimated according to ex isting laws, will be $-2..r00.00: and the esti mated ordinary expenditures, for the same peril mI, w ill le $-j:p;.3'-0,4rj OS; leaving a surplus of $-s,-179.5&7 32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of expendftnrce, actual an estimated, no amount is allowed for the stuVin? fund provided for by the act approved Feb ruary 25, 162, which requires that one per cent, of the euUre debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, how ever, a substantial compliance w ith the conditions of the law. By its terms the public debt should have been reduced between lHJ and the close of the last fiscal year $01 3,3;i.SO0 2S; the actual re duction of the ascertained debt in that period has been $720,614,730 til, being in excess of the re duction required by the biukiug Fund Act $2o2, 2s2.933 33. The amount of the public debt, less cash In the Treasury November 1, 1S73, was $2,021,200, 0S3 IS, a reduction aince the ti-.ua; dale last year, of $23,150,617 39. Hie progress made during the last year in re funding the public debt at a lower rate of interest is very .gratifying. The amount of lour per-ceiiU bomU sold during the present year, prior to Novem ber 23, 1S7S, is $100,270,900. and eix-per-ceut. bonds, commonly known aa live-twenties, to au equal amount have been or will be redeemed aa calls mature. It has been the policy of the TVpartment to place the four-per-cent. bonds within easy reach of j whet he small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasury reconiiuenda that the law be so modified that small sums may b iuvestod. and that through the poat-othces or other agent id tho Government, the freest opportunity may be gnen in ail parts of the country for such inveet iuenta. The beat mode suggested is. that the Department witlrii-1 to wro rfr t!!.t of dopt. o I "hi .miim'iun u- ilouai-fc h.r1o iniirw ! at the rte. f 3 65 per cut. per annnm. ami con vertible at any tune w:i.n one year affer their iMtie ii-fo f:e four-per-c-nt. bond autuorud by I tue Kc;iin'!::r Act. and to te wivd on'y in ex- j ei;jtif for United S:Me pofes t-nt ttheTreas urv by tuhi! or ntterw-ie.

With views o wit an red with rrard t the ant nn der which ib C4ii:uteof silver proteds, it has been the purpose of ti.e Secretary faithfully t ex ecute the law, aud to aiiord a fair trial wtu meas ure. t In the present financial condition of the eonntry I am persuaded thnt the welfare of legitimate busi ness and industry of every description will be beet promoted by absfainitijr from all attempts tc make radical chances in the cxiMms flnanciai leaislatutn. I-et it he understood that duntir the rominr year the bnsiness of the country will te uiiditnried by voverniueniMi interference with the laws affecting if, and we may confidently expect that the resump tion of specie payments, which wltl t;ike place at the aoftoiitted time, will tie successfully ami easilv niamtninefi. and that it will be fopowed by a health ful and enduring revival of hustnksa pmsperify. I-et tiie bealliitr influence of tune, tho inherent energies of our peopic. and the houndleM resources f our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief from present dnhculties will surely follow. The report of the Secretary of War shows the army baa been well and economically supplied; tnat our small force has ieen actively employed. and has faithfully performed all the service re-J quired of it. Toe mrnie of the army baa improved, and the numiter of deseruona baa materially de creased 1 urine the year. The Secretary recommends 1.

These recommendations are all commended to your favorable consideration. The rejMrt if the teecretary of the Navy shows that the navy lias improved dmingtha last tlscal year. Work lias been done, on seventy-five vessels, ten of winch have been thoroughly repaired, and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid pnrrea twaids completion. The total expendi tures ol the year, iiieludini; the amount appropri ated for the deficiencies of tim previous year, were $17.4W,3i2 T. Tiie actual exjienses chargeable lo the vear, exclusive of thee deficiencies, were rl3,30lUH4 Oi. or ai7t7.1!t9 13 less than thea of the previous year, and 4.0-i,H77 74 less than the expensew, includinc the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, li0. are $14.562.3h1 45 exceeding the appro priations of the present 'Vear only $33,949 75; which excess is occasioned by the demands of the Naval Academy aud the Marine C-orps, as explained iu the Secretary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $1452x, 431 70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the current expenses of the Ie part men t during the year. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1. to November 1, 17. i $4,740,544 14. of which $70,940 75 has beeu refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,b9,5o3 30, or $520, VJ9 24 leas than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. The reiMrt of the Postmaster General embraces a detailed statement of the operations of the Post office !epartnieut. Tne expenditures of that Ie partment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 137, were $34.163,0h4 49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order business and official stamps, were $29,277,5 1 95. The sum of $20O, 430 90, included in the foreroing statement of ex penditures, ia chargeable to preceding years, so that the actnal expenditures for the fiscal year end ed June 30, lH78.are t33,k74.o47 ftO. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in ati ditlon to the revenues of the Iepartment, was $5,307,52 H2. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18HO. are estimated at $3b 571.9on, and the receipts from all sources at $.tO. G04.023 OO, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,n76 10. The report calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads for carry iti the mail is regulated by law, and that the failure of Con gress to appropriate the amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the Government of resonsibi!tiy, but necessarily Increases the de ficiency bills w hich Cougrcsa will be called upon to pa.. In providing for the postal service, tne following questions are presented: Hhould Congress anuu aily appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established aa will make the Iepart ment self-sustamingt Should tho postal service be reduced by excliidiue from the mails matter which does not pay its way! Hiionld th number of post routes be diminished! ftbotdd other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or dimin ish the exNnses of the postal service! The International Postal Congress, which met at Paris Mav 1, 1"7H, aud continued in session un til June 4 of the same vear, was composed of deb egatea from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty eonc!u Jed at Berne Octolier 9, 174; which goes into effect on the 1st of April, ls79, between the countries whose defecates have si an ed it. It was ratified and approved by and with the consent of the President August 13, 187H. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Con vention will be found in the report of the Postmas ter General, aud the full text In the appendix thereto. In Its ori-in the Postal Union comprised twenty-three countries, having a population of three hundred and fifty millions of people. On the 1st of April next it will comprise forty-three coun tries and colonics, with a population of more than six hundred and fifty millions of people, aud wi:l soon, by the accession of the few remaining coun tries and colonies which maintain organized postal services, constitute, in fact as well as in name, as Its new title indicates, a Universal Union, regulat ing, upon a uniform ba.ds of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse letween all civilized Nations. Some embarrassment has arisen out of the con flict between the customs laws of this country and the provisionsof the Postal Convention, tn regard to the transmission of foreign hooks and newspa pers to this country by mail. It is hoped that Con cress will be able to devise some means of recon ciling t lie dtdiculties which have thus been created, so as to do justice to all parties Involved. The business of the Supreme Court, and of the Courts In many of the circuits, baa Increased to such an extent durimrthe past years that addi tional legislation is imperative to relieve and pre vent the delay of Justice aud possible oppression to suitors, which Is thus occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets ia presented anew In the report of the Attorney General, and the remedy suggested ia earnestly urged for Cgrea ei'Hial action. The - creation of additional Circuit Judces, as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense at the present rate of salaries of not more than sixty thousand dollars a year. Tho annual reports of the Secretary of the In terior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, present an elaborate account of the present condi tion of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their Interests. While the conduct of the Indians, generally, has been orderly, and their relations with their neigh bors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable In their character, but remained, happily, confined to a comparatively small Dumber of Indiana. The dis content among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts of violence on the part of some mem bers of the tribe and finally to the outbreak, ap pears to have been caused by an insuin ciency of food on the reservation, and Una insuffi ciency to have been owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations, tnade by Congress, to the wants of : the Indians, at a time w hen tlte Indians were pre vented from supplying tho deficiency by huntin. ' After an arduous pursu.t by the tioops of the! United states, aud several cigairements, the bos- 1 tile Indians were reduced to subjection, aud the J larger part of them surrendered theuivslvea as, prisoners. In this connection, I desire to call at ; tent ion to the recommendation male by the Secre- ! tary of the I n't nor, that a sullicient fuud be j placed at the disiHMul of the Executive, to be ued, w ith projxT accciirtaMIity.nt discretion, in auuden emergencies of the Indian service. The other ce of disturbance was that of a band ' of Northern Ciieyeiines, who suddenly left their j rear: vat inn in the Indian Territory and marcued. i rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska j ii tie direction of their old hunting grounds, com-, milling murders and other crime on their way. From document accomianyiiig the report of the! .Secretary of the lutenor, it apieara that ; this disorderly band W4S as fiuly enpplu-d , with the necej4aricfi of life as the four thou Hand ryven hundred other Indians wbo remained i;uiei- : ly on the reservation, aud that the disturbam-e was caused by men of a restlos and mischievous ' disposition among the Indiana themselves. Almost I the whole of this baud Uavo surrendered to li e t military authorities, nd it Is a gratifying fact: that, when some o the m aad taken refuge iu the camp of the Iletl (lotio !xux, w-itn whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners, aud resdiiy gave them up to the officers of the United tales, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit w hit h, alarm tug rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, tbty have uniformly shown ever since the wic they expressed at the Council of September, le77t had been complied with.

Such an ortanirastofi would raatenlly aid tlie army iu the accompli-ibmriit of a tak I of whtcn its numer ical stn-nth Is sometimM found InsutTicieiit. But, while the employment of force for the pre vention or repression of Indian troubles is of occa sional necessity, aud wt prctaration should be made to that end. greater reliance must be placed on humane and civihi!tia agencies for the ultiuiat eidutloa of what is called the Indian problem, it maybe very difficult, and require much patient effort, to curb the unruy spnt of the savage Iudian to the rest ra. nta of oi vUiarl lire, hut exsrience shows that it is not liniMMHible. May of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and slf-u;portiug were ihicc as s:iv;u;e aa any tuat at present roam over tbo Plains or in the mountains of the Kar HVst.and were tbeu etuisidered luaecsih!e to civilizing in fluences. It may he impowsiole to ruse iflt iu fullv up to the level of tlie while pooulation of the United States, but we should not forget that they are the aborigine of the country, aud called the soil their own on which our eopie have grown rich, powerful and ha,py. We owe it tr them aa a moral duty to help them in attaining at least thut degree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It ia not only our duty it is also our luteret to do so. Iudians who have liecome agrieulf urists or heriUmen, and feel aa interest in proerty. will thenceforth cease to beawarllfce aud disturbing clement. It is also a well-autheuticaled fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet wrm their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the ex pressions of Indians themselves ani from many concurring report, that there Is a steadily inrn-us-im; desire, even among Indiana belonging to com paratively wild tribes, to have their child re a edu cated. I invite attention to the reports of the 8ecretary of the Interior and the Com missioner of Indian Affairs, touching the eiiiiment recently Inaugurated, in taking fifty iuuian childre n, boys and girU. from d'dcreitt tnlw-s. to the liauipb-n Noimu.1 Ag:iLiUtur:il Institute, In Virginia. here they are to receive an elementary English education and training iff nTi eultiire and other n-c!ui work, to be returned to their trllK-s.nfter the completed course, a.-i Interpre ters, instnictcrs and examples. It is reprted that the olfiecr ebar.'e! with the selection of those chil dren might have !-:d thousands of young I:i b ins sent with him bad it ieeii p)siiile to make pro vision for them. 1 agree with the Secretary of tiie Interior in saying that "the result of this pit crest ing experiment, if favorable, may be destined to become an imisK iant factor In the advancement of civilization among the Indians.' Theqiiestiou whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made was. at the last session of Congress, referred to a committee for in quiry anil report. Without desiring to anticipate that report. I venture to express the hope that In the decision of so inqjortant a oueMion tne views expressed alxtve may not tie lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it may lie, will arrest fur ther agnation on this subject, such aulta'ioh being apt to produce a disturbing effect npou the service as well as on the Indians themselves. In the enrollment of the bill making appropria tions for sundry eivll expenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot r'p rings Commission was omitted. As the Commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many conflicting claims, the susimmisiou oi their labors, before de termining the nuhts of the claimants, threatened, for a time, to embamtss the Interests, not only of the Government, but also of a large numtter of "the chtzens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning contem plated improvements. Iu order to prevent serious ditlicultiea, which were apprehended, and at the solicitation of many leading elti aens of Hot hprlitgs, nnd others interested iu the welfare of ti e town, the Secretary of the In terior waa authorized to request the lateCmmis sionera to take charge of the records of their pro ceed ing aud to perform snch work as could prop erly be done by them under such circumstances, to facilitate toe future adjmlication of theclaimsat au early day, and to preserve the status of the claimants until their rights should be finally de termined. The late Commissionera complied with that request, and report that the testimony in all the eases has beeu written out, examined, briefed and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the requisite authority be given at as early a day In the session as iossible, and that a fair com pen sat ion le allowed the late Commissioners for the expense incurred and the labor periormed by them since the 27th of June last. I invite the attention of Congress to the recom mendations made by the Secretary of the Inferior with regard to the preservation of the timier on the public lands of tiie United States. The protec tion of the public proitercy is one of the first duties of the Government. The Llepartment of the In tenor should, tbcrofre, be enabled, by suihYlent apitropriation to enforce the laws in tiiat respect. Hut this matter appears still more Important as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, eseeially in the mountainous di trietswbere the rocky slopes once deuude l of their tree, will remain so forever. There the in Jury, once done, run not be repaired. I fully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that, bnr this reason, legislation touching the public ttmlier in tne mountainous States and Territories of the West, should le espec ially well considered, and that existing laws, in which the destruction of .he forests is not sutli ciently guarded arainst, should !k spcdi'y modi fied. A general law concerning this iiiijMirtant sub ject opiK-ars to me to be a matter of urut puolic noccPsity. From the organization of the Government, the importance of encouraging, by nil possible means, the increase of our agricultural productions has liccn acknowledged and urged upon tho atteuthn of Congress and the people as the surest and rc:wii est means of increasing our aubstantial aud endur ing prosperity. The words of Washington are as applicable to day as when, in his eighth annual message, he i-aid: "It is not to be doubted that with reference either to Individual or National welfare, agriculture is of primary imort:tuce. In proportion as Nations ad vance in population and other circumstances of maturity, this t rut It becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up. supnorted by the public puree nnd towhat object can it bededicated with greater propriety t Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of Boards composed of proper characters, churgd with collecting and d. ft using information, ami enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist the spirit of dis covery and improvement, this siiecies of establish ment contributing doubly to tho increase of Im provement by atimulatiuc to enterprise and ex periment, aud by drawing to a common center the results evervwherecf individual skill and observa tion, and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap ins t rum en U of immense National benefit. " The great preponderance of the agricultural over any other interest in the Unite l states entitles it to all the consideration claimed for it by Washing ton. About one-half of the population of the United States is engaged m agriculture. The value of the agricultural products or the United States for the year 17H. U estimated at three thousand millions of doUnra. The exports of agricultur.il products for the year 17, as appears from the report of the Korean of Statistics, were five hun dred and twenty-four million of dollars. The great extent of our country, with tta diversity of sod and climate, en a bite r to produce within our own borders, aud by our own labor, not only tlie necessaries but most of the luxuries that arc cm-sumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad vantages of soil, climate, and intercommunication. It appears from the statistical statements In the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many tu.ll ons of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could be raised tn our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of ad vanced agriculture which can nly be answered by experiments, often costly, and sometimes fruit less, which axe beyond the means of private indi viduals, and are a Just and proper ch irge on tiie whole Nation for the benerlt of tho N'jt:oa. It is good policy, especially In times of de pression and uncertainty In otuer busi ness pursuit s. with a Vast area of uncul tivated, and hence unproductive territory, is. ly oHned to hom stead setl lenient, to encourage, by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and tiPnge of the soil. The efforts of the la-piTt-ment of Agricu!: -'ire f o stimulate old and introduce new agricultural industries, to improve the quali ty and increase the quantity of our product., to dt termiue the Value of old or ciabhsn the im portance of new methods of culture, are woiihy of 3 our careful and favorable consideiat:on, and as sistance by such nppropriatioi's of money and en largement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the pre-ent favorable conditions for the growth, and rapid development of this Importunt inrc-ed. The abuse of animaU in transit it widely attract ing public attention. A Nation! Vmvcniiou of Societies specially intereslrd in the subject ir:s re cently met at Ilaltiuiore. and the faces developed, both in repaid to cruelties to animal and tho ef fect of such cruelties iiisin the public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Con grcs, and the enactment of more e flic lent laws for the reventlon of these abuses. The report of the Commissioner of the Pureaa of Education shows verv gratifying progress th-ough-out the country, in all the Interests committed to the care of this Important office. The report is es pecially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages of the common school s t-m, in acctiors of the couu;ry where the general enjoy ment of the privilege of the free schools U not yet attained. To education more thin to any other agency we are to look as the resource, for the advancement of the people, tn the requisite knowledge and appre ciation of their right and responsibilities as citi zens, and 1 deeire W fepaat the iotfffeetioa con ai-1. is a f t-ttinmbia. w tained In my f rmer messare In beha?f of the enactment of apfropriite messnres by Congress fr the purpose of supplement ire. with National the local system ot educuilcn in the several stares.

The estimate of revenue, based nnon exNtlnt! law. is !M;.7Mb.l2I 3 more than the acTiial revenue of the past vear. This estimate can only 1 real ised by strict nnd impartial enforcement of the revenue laws. This is not only a lejral duty of rev enue olhVers, but is the ritfhf of every honest tax paver. The enforcement of the tax on spirits and tobyeco has, hi some, places, been reisted by formidable combinations too powerful for the department, with tho forces at its com mand. t overcome. The customs duties, in many c:;sts. have been evaded by smttKiriirnr. fraud, undervaluation and false claims for tirswhacl' and daimire allowance. Sune of these obstructions are incident t the exe'ini(n of any tax law, but many of them may h overcome ly such iiHMlitieytious of the laws aa axe hereinaf ter recomriended. It is maulfc-d, from those estimates, tiat. bow ever desiraale it may be to rcdr.ee existing taxes, it otiL'ht not now to be done except by supplyinfc the reiluetions from other sources of revenue. Sta bility and certainty in the rate and subject of taxa tion are of preal Importance, and. therefore, the Secretary recommends that no change be made In them dorinit the present session, except to convert certain uf rtdartm duties, hercuiafUr stated.
