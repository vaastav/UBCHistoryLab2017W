Ho Is only 45 years old, but would bu taken for a man of slity. Ills faco Is thin and heavily lined. He said that he owed lil life to tho American people and that he could never forget their kindness. "liut for the resolution passed by the Sen ate a-kliic Kpnln to use clemency In my case, 1 'should never have reached America alive." he said "On Match 2b 1807. with -IK) men. I wis surrounded on three sides by 2,000 Hranlards under flon. Hernandez de Vclasco. Most of my men lied, but I was shot In tho left lee and foil Col. Dacalloa, my chief of staff, tried to keep the enemy oil with his revolver. hut I na !'ll0t twice below the knee, and the ease was hupeless. Alter my Imprisonment In Cabanas 1 firmly believed that both Dacal loa and myself would be shot. Gen. Pando at one time came to me and htutod that It I would accent autonomy my life would be spared I told him that as a Cuban General 1 should not be Insulted, and ho then said I mlcht he freed. I was surprlsod when I heard that I was to be exiled, and protested aainst nnv discrimination bolne inndo be tween me and tho other prisoners. My pro tests were not listened to. however, and I left Hitana ou the steamer Colon, on Dee. 10. "On tho oyaeo I hail thn freedom of the tblp and had very little to complain of. I was kept nt t'ndlr. thirty-six hours and reached Barcelona un Dec. 31. There was u creat ffite In proBress on that day, tho occasion beinc the untlline of tho jtatun of Christopher Colum bus in tlio Plaza do Colon. As soon as I had EOton the ship my hands were chained, and tnoe In chnrite of mo became vory insolent.

I had a guard of about forty soldiers and pain wore taken to make n spee ' taele of mo. 1'he streets wro thronced with 1 veople. but they did not offer to molest me, ilthoueh everywhere my approach was Croat 1 brcrlesof 'Viva Lspaflnl' The demonstra tion was particularly (treat as we passed the name of Columbus, to which several of tho soldiers drew my attention with evident pride, 1 could not help remarking to one of them upon the similarity of inv f ute with that of the discoverer of tho Western continent, hut as I pointed at tho statue with my manacled wrists the populace cheered in derision. "Upon reaching tho fortress j iras handed oyh to ttje Governor. Gen. Fernandez, nnd was vcrvniuch surprised to hoar him announce that I was to be'treated as a prisoner of war. 1 ivas fairly woll treated tin audi, and believe that my position was not different from that In which I would havefbeon held by othor na tion. This was In raark,ed contrast to Kpan Ish custom. Much of the time I was in the hospital. I was allowed oneo a week to see a copy of an Kmillsli newspaper and followed the events of the vfnr with Interest. Jitters from ir wifo 'reached me at times, but they were all mutilated 'by the censor." In reply to n question as to tho future, of Cuba, tie said tlut, coming from Europe, he vas a little ignorant of the latest develop ments. i . , ... 1 The American people made a declaration I) In Congress for tbo Independence of Cuba. nnd went to vrar for humanity's sake, and I suppose they will keep their word." he said. "Jf It is foiind, that we are not able to govern nurMhM.,1 would prefer that, Cuba should he ahtntoof tho rjnitedaratesjtbut not a Ter ritory. Yfo are an enlightened people, and ilesorvo the rleht of Statehood, If annexation ever conies. Before that, however, a chance should te glvn us to govern ourselves. I have great sympathy for the United States, and I would not mind seeing Cuba one of the Mates ef the great republic but I have been llctitiM for Independence since my boyhood, and I would like tu try it. "Illthtte is'a party In this country whloh wants annexation, it should not force mat tens. Had this country not had a nation tc tight that had been lighting us for three years it vrculd not have achieved such great results. It li not good for Americans to slight the Cubms. 1 don't think the Cuban troops will eauie any trouble, and I approve of tho Ameri can occupation as a moral force In restoring ort'er. At the same time, tho Americana can not keep order In the interior of tho Island. Daly our trpops on do that; but I do not tslnk there will be any more serious troublo In Cuba now. Klon. Garcla's death wilt In no far affect the political situation. "The situation in Hraln I do not consider critical. The people seem to feel they have (learned a lesson. To my mind. It will not be a lutltre one." however." Qei Rivera left for Washington Inst n'ght to attend the funeral of Gen. Garola.

TRICK DOG BITES TITO FEOPX.E. Cava a Free Street Show and Resented the Critlciams of the Audience. Henry It. Boyle of 212 West Seventeenth street was on his way home last night when ho sawn big bulldog como out of tho hall of 112 Seventh avenue Tho dog walked to tho centra ot the sidewalk, stood on his hind legs, and then proceeded to do the cooohee-coochee dance. "What's this?" quoth Mr. Boylo. "I should have started homo sooner." Ho continued to watch tho talented dog, how ever, nnd pretty soon was rowarded by seolng tho dog hop about, waving his front paws as If ho wero a pugilist punching the hag. Then tho dog sat down on his haunches and looked nround as If expecting some applause. "That dog's crazy." remarked Boyle to tho crowd ot spectators that had gathered. The animal looked reproachfully at Boylo, did a tew waltr. steps, walked on his forelegs, turned sev eral Bomorsaulta and then again sat down and lookodnboiit him expectantly. . " Ho ought to bn shot." declared Boyle. This was too much for the dog. He jumped for Boyle and took n strong grip on that gen tleman's left leg. The crowd scattered and Boylo kicked tho animal off and left to hunt up a doctor to cauterize the wound. Then the dog began the programmn nil over again. He soon had another crowd of interested spectators, and among them was Johnny Murphy, 14 years old. who lives at 14(1 Seventh avenue. "Uullygeol" shouted Johnny. "Look ntde mutdoln' stunts.". Such n characterization was offensive to a dog of such blue dog blood. He stopped his tricks and uyed Johnny in a suspicious manner, no resumed them again, however, und Johnny once more gave vent to his delight. " Dat cayoodle'a a peach I" ho yelled. Then tho animal made a dnsh and Johnny a right leg was what suffored. Tho crowd sepa rated them and then they aliased the dog up to Sixteenth street and then through to Seventh avenue, where Policeman Cal houn of the West Twentieth street station captured the animal. Calhoun was about to shoot tho dog at the demands of theexoltod crowd-whon Austin, II. Hoberts of 112 Seventh avenue camo running up and protested. He suid he was the owner of the doc and de manded thut the crowd go to the station nnd tell the facts to the Sergeant. Sergeant Qulnn was on tne desk when the procession arrived. "That's a trick dog," said Itoberts. "and he's worth more than his weight in gold. Ho can punch the bag and don hundred other tricks. Ilo appears regularly at the vaudeville 4 iiat rfH "Iwori't take thn responsibility of ordering him shot," said Sergeant Qulnn. "I'll lock him in a cell for tho night, and you two people who are bitten can go to Jefferson Market Court In the morning and lot the Judge decide what to do." Tho dog was locked up, and till midnight Sorgeant Qulnn puzzled over what charge to muki) on tlio blotter against tho animal. He considered disorderly conduct, felonious as sault and mayhem, and then gave It up. leaving the apace blank. The dog howled all nights much to the disgust of the other prisoners. Boyle and Johnny had their womuds cauterized at Kew York. Hospital. KOW IN FRENCH CIIAMBER. DEPUTIES COME TO BLOWS OTKR DRETFUS-rXCQVART AFFAIR.

The Chamber passed a voto ot con fidence in the Government, 4U3 to 78. 8cenrs of excitement resulted from tho In terpellation of M. Groussot, who denounced tho nntl-natloiial conspiracies of tho members of tho general staff, and declared that they wero guilty ot treason. This declaration caused an uproar, during which sovoral blows wero struck. The Presi dent's calls for ordor wero Ignored, and he was about to suspend tho sitting vvhcu partial calm was restored, Tho discussion continued, how ever, amid varying degrees of agitation. It) tho courso ot tho uproar MM. LaeloB, Bougere, Cadluat, und Zuvaoa engaged In fist lights and were separated by the ushers. M. Grousset attempted to read a letter purporting to havo been written by the German Emperor. Immediately Ministers nnd Doputles by tho scoro leaped to thelr.fect and vehemently pro tested against tho reading. During a lull in the confusion M. Groussct shouted n dcclata tlon that the gciiornl staff had condamnod Dreyfus without any proof. M. do FreyclnutandPremlcr Dupuy defendod tho army, which, they declared, was wholly do votod to Its duties. They warned M. Groussot not to drag tho army Into party polomlcs. Tho order of the day was demanded and confldonco in tho Govemmont wns nlllrmed. Tho sum total of M, Grousset's efforts In tho Chamber ot Deputies wns tho raising ot nn atrocious clamor and the wasting ot the wholo afternoon. They contributed nothing to tho cause of civil liberty, howevor well In tentloned thoy may havo boon. M.

Thcso references worn based on various nowspapor rumors, and tho powers referred to wero Ger many, Ruosin, Austria and Italy, nil ot whom wore represented as bolng Implicated tn tho protests. M.

Up to a late hour this afternoon, with tho ex ception of a slight demonstration In front of the military prlion of Chercho Midi by a small crowd ot nnti-rcvtsionlsts. there has boon no sign of the expected trouble. Paul DSroul6de. who had called a meeting of tho Lenguo of Patriots to further protest against Dreyfus and Plequart, did not make his appearaneo. After the small demonstration at the Cherche Midi prison tho crowd marched to tho Hotel des Involutes, cheering tho army on tho way. From there It marched to tho ofTlcInl resldenco of Gen.

Tho crowd then proeoeded to tho Cham ber ot Deputies, where. In a BDcech to his fol lowers before entering, M. Millovoyo said he would carry Into tho Chamber the echo ot their Indignant protests. Ho concluded by advising them to disperse, an operation in which tho crowd, which was not numerous, was asslstod by tho police. All of tho railway stations which were pro tected last evening against an outbreak grow ing out of the popular fueling In regard to DreyfuB and Picquartare still strongly guarded by tho military, and several thousand Repub lican Guards nnd police agents aro doing special duty In various parts ot the city.

Coedncntlon to Stay. Says Dr. Raymond Dr. MncCracken on the Philippines. At the annual dlnnor ot the Alumni Associa tion of Wesloyan University nt tho Hotel Savoy last evening Dr. B. P. Baymond, President of Weileyan. talked on tho subject of coeducation, or, as ho put it, the woman question. "It's an old qutstlon." he said ; "it goes back about as far nstheGardon of Eden: and It hasn't been settled up to date and Is not likely to be In tho near future The supreme de mand of our time Is for robust, honest, manly, independentforceful men. I believe that tho college'has tho important work of developing tnls type rf manhood. It tho number of wo men now In Weslevnn University were to be largely Increased we should lose somothlng ot the strength and courage that come from tho intercourse of men with mon. But that daesn't necessarily settto tho question that there should be no women In the university." Dr. Raymond suggested the appointment ot a oommltteo of seven to study tho qU3stlon and continued: "There Is a perfect unanimity In the faculty that wo cannot shut our doors entirely against women now." Chancellor H. M. MacCrucken of the Now York University spoke on the Philippine ques tion. Describing tho visit to tho VYIilto House of the delegation which carried the resolu tions of the Saratoga Convention on the coun try' foreign polloy to President McKmley, he said: "President McKInley declared, and II was a noble declaration, that we could only judge cf our national destiny by doing our duty as a nation. "Until this date." he continued. "I have not found that the President has departed from any ot the four propositions submitted. I cannot Imagine how the United Statos Son ate can reruse to approve tho treaty. That treaty and tho position of President McKIn ley lathe working out In our political rela tions of the Bamo sentiment of duty to the world (hat Inspired Wilbur I'Uk lWesleyan's first Presldontl when he said: 'My sole object Is the education of young men for the world.' " Dr. MacCraeken said that hull a dozen such men as Dr. Carroll, whom President MuKln ley sent to Porto itlco. should be sent to Ma nila to investigate and repo't on education In tho Philippines More educational commis sioners nnd fewer Generals should he our poller, Holland, with only two-thirds the population of Now ork Stato nnd only 5(1 per cent, more population than New York city, governed anil helped

"When thn partv of Little Amorloans can show me a nation mom likely than wo to give education to the ld.OOo.iKM) people or the Philippine Islands." Dr. MacCrauken said, "I shall favor negotiating with that nation to take tho protectorate of those Islands. The times requlro American altriislm, which Is only a modern phrase to express what we ought to do If we would be worthy the name of our fathera. If there be nuy message which I would favor thU meeting to-night seudtnir to President McKInley and Congress it would be simply this; 'Go on, and do tho next thing," Alleged New York Pickpocket Arrested.

Garcia having re ceived the last sacramonts ot tho Church, thero was no opposition to tho services bolng held in the church, although ho was a Free mason. Strong pressure Is being brought to bear on Cardinal Gibbons to bo prosont at tlio funeral, and It Is probnbto that he will accede to the request. Ho camo to Washington this afternoon to be present nt tho dinner at tho English Embassy and romalnod at St. Pat rick's rectory over night. Ho oxpectod to return to Bnltlmoro early to-morrow morn ing, but hns been urged to remain for tho funeral. It lias been represented to him that Gen.

DIVVER'S BEKFSTE.IK SOCIAL. Martin ISngel Not to He Allowed to Over crow the Second with ma Pink Teas. Tho P.Dlvvor Association does not proposo to allow Its prostlgo to suffer by the giddy whirl ot social functions Into which the Martin Engel Association of " de Ate" has plungod. When Charles Kramer, ono of Martin Engel's lieutenants, recently opened a muslahall on the Bowery near Grand stroet the DIvverites kept their eyes on It. Tho Atlantlo Garden, two blocks south on tho Bamo sldo ot the Bowery, has long beon tho social headquarters of the DIvverites. The leading lights ot the district, including P. Dlvver himself. Judge Bolto. Sam Wolf, Bob Dovo, Jimmy Dlvvor nnd James Slovin can bo found thoro almost nny night drinking In inspiration from Moyer beer, while tho lesser lights take nny old beer. But Kramer's is a moro gorgeous place and something had lobe dono to restore the balance In favor of the Second district, so the Dlvvnrs gavo a beefsteak party last night at the Dlvver Club. P. Dlvver himself arranged It. Shortly be fore 8 o'clock Bale Hook llogan carrlod the beef Into tho largo hall in thn clubroom and deposited It on a table. Lxcited mon crowded around him. "Now, I say, yuuso rollers just keep yer shirts on. Ityotisohnin t had yer suppers yet tut wait," said Bale Hook llogan. Ho weighs 200 pounds, and nobody disputed his order. A raugo had boen put up in thu back of tho room, and ltudolph Katzenburg.n butchorfrom Wash ington Murket, began to cut tho portions, " Give me n plocu ot tier tenderloin j" shouted ono man, "Give Jimmy Ollvor a hunk off der neok." shouted another. This was regard ort as an unkind cut for Jimmy, because In thn har monized organization of the district Jimmy Oliver is tho ono man who would not have been welcome it he had ateuded. It requliod lino and diplomatic work on tho part of Katzonburg to distribute thn steak without causing jealousy. p. Dlvvor, Judgu Bolte and Congressman-elect Daniel J. lllordoii got tenderloin. Thn sirloin went to tho district captains and otllcoholders. A sir loin In tho Hecond district has a way of extend ing itself, and very good sirloins ran be cut off the rump or even the shoulder It the demand is large. Some of the followers ot Niok Brown, who lod a revolt against Dlvver. got this sort of surloln. Men who wero lukewarm In the last eleotlon. but who promise to bo good next year, consumed tho chuck. There were no grades in the mixed ale, and there was no limit to it. Ed Coppers Introduced an artist named Fisher, who presented the club with u life-size crayon of the Hon. P. Dlvver. Fisher was called on for a speech but Coppers said he was too T.9a.M.tv. " i5" rlaTlit, fenepj." said Coppers. "What he would say, It he could, he's sot in hla bead." FOR AN ECONOMIC PEACE.

Herrlllchtorcrltlolsodtho Emperor's recent trip to Palestine and reforrod to tho footings of loathing with which Germans vlowed tho Armenian atrocities. Continuing In this vein, Herr nichter ralsod tho question ot tho neces sity for tho creation of a Itogency to aot during tho Kaiser's long abaonccs from tho country. He also vigorously denounced tho expulsions of aliens and Immigrants. Deferring to tlio Spanish-American war, nerr Hlchtur declared that tho sympathies ot tho German nation woro not with Spain. Ho also took occasion to domand that Inoreased facili ties bo afforded for tho Importation ot Ameri can meats. Count von Posadowsky-Wehner, Minister ot tho Imperial Treasury, said that tho Govern ment was awaiting tho report ot tho Gorman expert who had been sont to America. Herr von DQlow. Mlnlstor ot Foroign Affairs, announced that thero had beon a satisfactory oxchnngo of vlows between Germany and Amorlca, and he continued to hope for the con clusion of au economic peaco with tho United States. Her von Billow said he was glad to know that Germany's attltudo during tho Spanish Ameri can war was approved. The Government had steered scrupulously and observed a loyal neutrality and so had not disturbed her rela tions with either belligerent. Germany would have preferred. In the in terests of humanity nnd her own commercial Interests, tho prevention of the war, hut after tho efforts In that direction had boen frus trated she could only leave matters to take their course Mcanwhilo tlio utmost efforts had beon mado to prevent injuty to tho Ger man shipping trade. Tho Foreign Minister added that ho hoped that the consclontlous, straightforward lino followed by tho Govornmcnt had demonstrated thopcacofulncssot Its disposition and created confidence in the honosty of Its policy. After oxprosslng his bollof that with mutual good will, tho friendly relations with the United States would be rctalnod, Herr von Billow dwelt upon Germany's deslro for peace. Tho peace of tho world, ho said, dopended on a compromlso be tween national self-lntorcst and tho common duty of civilisation. Germany, while mindful that hor strength depended on tho keenness of her sword, would always be true to tho princi ples ot humanity, tho cause ot penco and the Interests of commerce. In an earlier part of his speech Herr von BOlow dealt with Germany's relations with Austria. Ho declared that tho expulsions of the Slavs In no wise endangered tho friendship betweon the two nations, nor wns any disturbance of tho Triple Alltanco to be feared. I Loud applause. The Triplo Alliance, ho added, was a historic work of great statesmanship which endured, and which preserved tho most complete internal autonomy with absolute independence abroad. All the parties concerned were equally Inter ested in Its malntenanco and would lose equally if it were dissolvod. Begardlng the expulsions themselves, Herr von BDlow said: "Tho right to expel Is one ot our sovereign privileges, and we will not allow It to be en croached upon by anybody." Ho doslred to say no moro on tho subject, whict. he said, was a potty difference, merely of a business na ture, and need not be treated In other than conciliatory manner. Iteferrlng to the relations with Groat Britain, Herr von BQlovv said that all he would now say, but he thought that a great deal,' was that thore were all sorts of questions and a great variety of points In which Gormany could go. and does gladly go, together with England without prejudicing and completely maintaining other valuable relations.
