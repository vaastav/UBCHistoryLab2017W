Hanson, in Corvallis, Or., Dec. 2nd 1883, by D. Carlile, J. P., Mr. Jamas B. Yonng of Lane county, Or., to Miss Bell E. Jessie of Benton county, Or. A Childs Devotion' Twenty years ago a pioneer by the name of Robertson was hurried near Woodburn in Marion Co. his wife and two daughters removed to Albany and the grave was left with only a board to mark its location. The eldest daughter who can just remember her father has always cherished a desire to place at his grave a marble monument and now after years of hope' and many months of labor as teacher, has earned the long coveted money and accomplished her desire. We are premitted to extract the following tribute to her devotion from a private letter by a friend " She is going to day to see her fathers grave. I would like to go with her; my mother is dea i and I should understand 1 should hot ask her the color of his hair or eyes wlreu lie tiled nor if he was good. I shoulb only stand with her by the spot where her weary labor has raised a monu ment and her loving hands have tried to efface the traces of neglect. He died twen ty years ago and the passer by has said; In all his life he did not earn a slab to his grave or leavea friend behind'", but he did! He left a child, who after all those years of waiting for her hands to grow strong, comes to day to plant sweet flowers about his bed and mingle her silent tears with the clay above him. This is her day of triumph. I should like to see her there; Because of all the world and for this deed, to me she would look fairest and will stand as near to heaven as ere again until her form is mingling with the clay and living hands have planted flowers over her. Newport Items. Our district school closed last week and Mr. S. G. Irvin our efficient teacher is go ing out to the valley to spend the holidays.
