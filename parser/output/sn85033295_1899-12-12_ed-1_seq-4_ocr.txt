Address The Watertown Republican, Watertown, Wisconsin. TUESDAY. DECEMBER 12. 1899. Washington Letter. I'From our Regular Correspondent.! Washington, December 8, 1899.-- The Republicans in both branches ot congress have shown a commendable disposition to get right down to the work of the session. In the senate the committees are being rearranged, in order to give them a Republican membership in accordance with the Republican majority, and the finan cial bill, which is one of the most im portant measures passed, baa been introduced and referred to the finance committee. In the house the Repub lican caucus has endorsed the finan cial bill prepared by its committee and arranged to put it through the house at once, besides adopting rules —those of the last house—and dis posing of the Roberts case, and, in order to facilitate business. Speaker Henderson has named t he committee on rules. This is a remarkable show ing for the first week of the session, e ul indicates that this will he a busi ness congress. Frankess is the keynote of Presi dent McKinley’s message, [t neither dodges nor juggles any issue now be fore the country. These facts become clearer the more the message is stud ied, and it is a document that will repay the closest study. It does pre eisely what the pr-- - dent's message to congress was intended to do—teils the present state of the union—and indicates plainly the things the presi dent thinks congress ought to do. It declare* for support, of the existing gold standard; for the increase of our merchant marine; for legislation to curb the power of trusts - for free Cuba, as early as the Cubans can be trusted to maintain a stable govern ment; for the abolition of all custom tariffs between the United States and Porto Rico and the establishment of civil government on the island; for the retention of the Philippines; for the early construction of an Isthmian canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, and the laying of a Pacific cable; for the providing of a p"oper form of government for Ha waii, and against entangling foreign alliances. It is doubtful whether any other single president’s message ever contained so many or such frank dec larations upon important matters. Even td l * political opponents have joined i . congratulating President AL-Kii iley on his message. Representative Taylor, of Ohio, who made the objection to sw - earing ii Roberts, of Utah, as a member of t \e house, and who is chairman of toe committee appointed by Speaker Henderson, under the resolution adopted by the house with only thirty one adverse votes, to investigate the charges against Roberts, and who was, for the time, floor leader of the Republicans, added new laurels to his reputation as a ready debater during the discussion of the resolution. He said the argument of the Democrats, that Roberts should be taken into the house and then put out again, reminded him of a bit of poetry writ ten when King Charles tried to batter down the doors of the English par liament and to deprive the Commons of their privileges, which quoted one of the members as saying: “I hear a lion in the lobby roar. Say. Mr. Speaker, shall I shut the door? Or, shall we let him iu, and then See if we cannot put him out again.” Had Mr. Roberts not been allowed to make a speech in his own behalf, the Democrats would have had diffi culty in using the time allotted to them for discussion of the Roberts resolution,and thespeechof Roberts, instead of being a defense of himself, was merely an attack upon others. Jr was remarked as a mournful co incidence that the senate should ad- journ two days in succession— the first f woof the session—as a mark of respect to two men intimately con nected with that body; first for the late Vice President Hobart, who was its honored presiding officer, and next ; for the late Senator elect Hayward, I of Nebraska, whose death is expected j to result in the sending of another Idem-pop senator, by appointment of the governor of Nebraska. Mr. Quay’s friends in the senate purpose having his credentials speed ily acted upon. Senator Chandler has offered a resolution for his ad mission to a seat, and the resolution and his credentials have been referred to the committee on privileges and elections, from which a report is ex pected shortly. There is very little doubt that the report will be in favor of Mr. Quay, and that it will be adopted by a substantial majority of the senate. Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio, has re signed the chairmanship of the house Republican caucus, which he so ably filled in the last congress, and Repre sentative Cannon, of Illinois, unani mously elected, being nominated by Gen. Grosvenor, to the position. There was no other reason for the resignation of Gen. Grosvenor than a desire to give Mr. Cannon the honor. Among the nine hundred odd bills and resolutions introduced in the house this week was a bill, by Repre sentative Bingham, of Pennsylvania, appropriating $50,000 for the erec tion of a statue of the late General George B. Meade. Senator Chandler has gone a little further than the president did, and introduced bills applyingthecustoms and internal revenue laws of the United States to Porto Rico and Cuba alter January 1,1900, and pro viding that commerce between the islands and the United States shall be as between the states. In the December rum her of The American Monthly Review of Reviews there is an editorial summary of the results of the elections, with a dis cussion oi their import as an indorse ment of the administration’s policy. The editor also describes the progress of the Philippine campaign, the war in South Africa, and many other matters of international interest.

Dropsy is a terrible disease in its last stage. At first no disease is ap parently more harmless, a little puff ing of the eyelids or hands or a slight swelling of the feet, ankles or abdomen. Yet no death is more fearful. The un fortunate patient slowly drowns in the water of his own blood. Dr. Miles’ specialty is diseases of the heart, liver, kidneys, nerves and dropsy. To introduce his new dropsy treatment he will give away SIO,OOO worth. Hundreds of testimonials of the most remarkable cures will be sent on request. One gentleman was cured after having been given up by ten Grand Rapids physicians; a lady after six able Chicago doctors had pronounced her case hopeless. Mr. H. Groce, of 404 Mountain street, Elgin. 111., aged 72, was thought to be incur able from dropsy, which x-eached to his lungs and caused smothering spells, cough, shortness of breath. He reports: “Dropsy all gone; better every way. Mr. James Pluxux ton, editor of the Russiaville Sun, Ind., writes: “Mrs. P. was given up by three physicians. She owes her life to Dr. Miles skill. She now performs her household duties at 65 years of age.” Alex. Ethicr. Calumet, Mich., states: “I suffered seriously for five yeai - s from dropsy, rheumatism and heart disease. After taking personal treatment I gained 60 pounds and now always feel well.” Mrs. M. B Morelan of Rogers, Columbia county, Ohio, says; “Dr Miles saved my life by cubing me of that aw ful disease, heart trouble; I suffered terribly.” Miss Sophia Snowberg, of 282 Twenty-one ayenue, Minneapolis, testifies that “Three days alter commencing to take treat ment for dropsy it was nearly all gone, after two allopathic and two homeopathic physi clans had failed.’ Mr. A. P. Colburn, of Blessing, la.: “Dr. Miles ti’eatment lias per formed a miracle for Mrs. C. after her leg burst from dropsy.” Dr. Miles’ treatment is much su perior to any others and to obtain the best result it is prepared for each patient.
