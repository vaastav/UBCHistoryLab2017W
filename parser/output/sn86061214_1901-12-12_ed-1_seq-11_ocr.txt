MEMBER OF CREDENTIAL COMMITTEE 'Has Been Hard at Work for Past Week —Says President Gompers Will Be "I Re-elected— Roosevelt's Message Well Received—Other News. The Courier is in receipt of a letter •t from Joseph F. Byrne, who is at pres ent attending the American Federa tion of Labor meeting in Scranton, Pa. Mr. Byrne was honored by President Gompers of the Federation with a membership on the committee on cre dentials, and for the past week he has been busy day and night on this work. The committee met in Chicago before going to Scranton and much of its bus Iness was fixed lip at that meeting. This is the most important committee of the organization as it has the seat ing of delegates as its object Accord ing to the Associated Press dispatchcs its report was submitted Saturday. Mr. Byrne hopes to be able to give {•, more attention to his correspondence after this and readers of the Courier may expect many more interesting let 4 ters, as the great labor meeting pro greases. He is representing the Ot tumwa Trades and Labor Assembly at Scranton, and is also organizer for Iowa for the American Federation of Labor. His letter is as follows: Scranton, Pa., Dec. 5. 1901. Dear Courier:—The twentieth cen tury meeting of the great labor organ ication, the American Federation of Labor, is now on, and the battle for the maintenance of not only ourselves as American workingmcn, and our de pendents, but our posterity as working people is now in the hands of the dele gates to this convention. What will be the result? In looking over the delegates in at tendance and judging from my experi ence in the labor field, I would say that everything that organized labor expects at the present time wiil come to them from the twentieth century convention of the American Federation Of Labor, the greatest convention in the history of the labor movement in 4 the world. The majority of the dele •J gates are for strist "Trades Autono toy." The address of President Gomp ers required three hours and twenty five minutes to deliver. It was a grand effort, and met with great ap plause. There is no doubt but that President Gompers will be re-elected to office by this convention, but H. A. Morrison, the present secretary may have some trouble in being returned to his office. President's Message Well Received. The message of President Roosevelt in relation to labor matters met with prolonged applause, and it is the sense of the "labor leaders" of this country that he is the best President we have yet had. Shaffer Present. President Shaffer of the Steel •Workers is here, and will make no flgkt before the convention. It had been thought that he might make some representations or ask for some thing that could cause trouble, but this was apparently all false alarm. Satisfied With Iowa. As I look at conditions in the cast, I cannot but feel that the same condi tions are far better in the west. I have not seen anything, but what we can show them something better back in the western country, and especially is this true among the common people. After having given the matter careful thought, I cannot but feel that I live in the greatest country in America. Facing a Busy Week. Scranton, Pa., Dec. 9.—Having dis posed of ail the preliminaries, the American Federation of Labor is now reay to plunge into the six days of ac tual business. So many questions are pressing for attention that every hour of the time will be crowded. Trade autonomy, considered by many delegates as the most important question to come before the conven tion, is likely to attract much atten tion. The brewery workmen and the mine workers delegates probably will be the storm center on this, question. Both of these trade unions want in dustrial autonomy that is, they advo cate that all trades in one industrial establishment should form one organ ization for the better advancement of the condition of all. They also an Bounce that they will oppose trade au tonomy to the bitter end. The miners in their argument say that if a handful of engineers or fire men employed in a mine should strike it would cause the mine to be closed, and thus throw out of work hundreds of men who may have no grievances. If all trades in the mine were united under one head the mino workers say much friction could be avoided. Those who advocate trade autonomy claim it would be fatal for them to enter such a combination, and that no good result could come from an amalgamation of that kind. Cannot Dodge It. The autonomy question Is likely to be introduced by either the firemen or engineers, which organizations are contesting the rights of the brewery workmen and mine workers to force firemen and engineers employed in those places to join the brewers or mine works' unions. Sit ,' z. ~^k 1 $?•. deals specifically with the work of the federation during the year. It may make some reference to the failure of the recent steel strike, although that labor struggle, it is understood, has not officially come before the council. May Reopen the Fight. There has been no development in the Gompers-Mitchell-Shaffer contro versy, which grew out of the strike. Diligent inquiry failed to confirm the rumor that the matter will be thrash ed out on the floor of the convention. The principals in the affair maintain an absolute silence, but the close friends of each side express confi dence as to the outcome if the con troversy is thrust upon the dele gates. 

BANKS ARE LIABLE. A Sweeping Decision by Revenue Com missioner. J. W. Yerkes, United States revenue collector, has just rendered an impor tant decision that affects banks all over the country. The commissioner holds that bankers must return for taxation capital, surplus, undivided profits, and borrowed money used in the business of banking. All decis ions at variance with this last ruling are rescinded by the order of the commissioner. The decision in full is as follows: Treasury Department, Office of Com missioner of Internal Revenue. Washington, D. C., Dec. 3, 1901.— Sir:—Your letter of October 21, 1901, inclosing certain claims for the refund ing or certain amounts alleged to have been paid in excess as special tax on the business of banking, has been received. These claims have been examined, and have been rejected, as you have already been advised. You are informed that the act of June 13, 1898, and the act of March 2. 1901, provide that bankers using or employing a capital not exceeding $25,000 shall pay $50 when using or employing a capital exceeding $25,000 for every additionel $1,000 in excess of $25,000, $2 and in estimating capi tal surplus shall be included. The law defines a banker and des cribes the business of banking. The law provides that bankers shall pay tax on their capital employed (1. e„ employed in the business of banking), and that in estimating capital surplus shall be included. This office holds that capital is tax able whether invested as in the case of the United States bonds or the bank building (see T. D. 19843. pp. 4 and 5). or circulating as in the case of money, including money borrowed (see T. D. 20154), also surplus includ ing undivided profits. In providing that surplus shall be Included as capital, it is obviously the purpose of the law to have the tax im posed apply to all money used or em ployed by banks as capital in carry ing on their business. Money borrowed by banks, and used as capital, is held to be taxable (T. D. 19843), and it is clearly no less liable to tax because of the fact that it is borrowed by a bank from its own undivided profits. The fact that surplus so consists wholly or in part of undivided profits, or that such undivided profits have or have not been formally set apart for such use, seems wholly immaterial so far as the purpose of the act is con cerned. It is the use, not the author ity to use, that brings such profits within the taxing provisions of the act. Banks should, therefore, return for taxation the capital, the surplus fund, their undivided profits or othel' profit and loss account, except so much thereof as may be actually necessary and has been set apart to meet ascer tained liabilities and losses, or to pay dividends actually declared by the directors of the bank, to pay taxes, or to pay fixed annual charges, such as salaries and other necessary annual expenses. The opinion of this office is, that capital and surplus" include all funds employed by the bank in the business of banking, and that natu rally and in the ordinary course of banking business are so employed, ex cluding only such funds which, though temporarily used by the bank are of necessity withdrawn from tho banking business through the payment of di vidends, taxes, ascertained losses, or fixed charges of whatever character. Any decision of this office r.t var iance with the above is hereby re scinded. Respectfully, The matter of trade jurisdiction is .. also expected to cause a long discus-1 l^t "ight from congestion of lungs re sion, particularly on the part of the wood workers, who make the point that trades such as piano-makers are wood workers, and should come into sll' sa 144 J.

TARENTOOSKALOOSA Richard Williams to Face a Charge of Murder. HE TALKS OF HIS MOVEMENTS Admits Being in Buxton at Time the Crime Was Committed But Refuses to Say Anything About the Killing— Cold Blooded Murder. "V'T'-TIF.-p [From Tuesday's Dally.] Richard Williams, colored, charged with the murder of William Sharpless in Buxton Sunday evening, was taken to Oskaloosa this morning, where he will be given a preliminary hearing on a charge of murder in the first de gree. As more particulars of the crime are received, the more cold blooded it appears. So far as known Williams had no trouble at all with Sharpless, and if the story of those present can be taken for the truth, the murdered man was the victim of a mistake on the part of the murderer. While Williams admits he was in Bux ton at the time of the murder, he will not say that he committed the deed. He did state, however, that he had no trouble with Sharpless, and that he does not know how the murder hap pened to have been committed. Just before leaving for Oskaloosa this morning he told Chief Gray and a Courier reporter that he took a team from Buxton and drove to Albia, com ing on into this city on No. 2. He says the team broke away from him just as he reached Albia, and he does not know what became of it. The firm of Woodson and Brown have been retained to defend him, and George H. Woodson went to Oskaloosa with Wil liams this morning to arrange for the preliminary hearing, which will prob ably be held in that city this after noon. A Cold Blooded Deed. The story of the murder unearths one of the most blood-thirsty crimes that was ever committed in the state of Iowa. William Sharpless and a number of other miners were drinking in what was called "the shack" at Bux ton early Sunday evening. "The shack" is a blind pig, and was built directly on the line between Monroe and Mahaska counties. The man that runs it has his house built partly in Monroe county and partly in Mahaska county. His living apartments are in Monroe county, and it is alleged the liquor traffic was carried on in Ma haska county. While Sharpless and his party were drinking in the place It is charged that Williams entered and asked for a drink. It is alleged that Williams was standing at the bar, Sharpless asked him for a sum of money which he (Williams) is alleged to have owed Sharpless. Without answering Sharpless it is alleged that Williams said "I'll kill you," and turn ed on his heel and left the place. Without a Word. Within a few moments, it is alleged that Williams came back, and walking up behind Sharpless, placed the re volver directly behind his right ear and pulled the trigger. Sharpless fell to the floor without a word, and when the habitues of the place reached him he was dead. The bullet entered just to the rear of the right ear and passed out just to the rear of the left ear. Stole a Team. After the shooting it is alleged that Williams ran to the stable of a man named Coleman, for whom he had been working, and hitched up a team of horses to Coleman's buggy, and drove off. Coleman saw Williams hitching up, but at that time had not heard of the murder, and he did not give the matter a second thought. Wil liams drove rapidly south, and within an hour had reached Albia. about nine miles south of Buxton. Here he wait ed until No. 2 arrived, when he caught the train and came into this city. Went to Bed. As soon as Williams reached this city he went to Gilbert's ?hop house, wheie he secured a room and went to bed. He got upftearly yesterday morn ing, and visited several places frequented by negroes, and late in the afternoon drifted down to Smoky Row, where he was captured by Captain Gallagher and Officer Pitts. Found the Gun. When he was searched at the sta tion a big 44 or 45 calibre revolver was taken from him with one chamber empty, and it is surmised that the bul let from this chamber killed Sharpless Sheriff Crjckett arrived in this city late last night to take Williams back to Oskaloosa, but was forced to re main here until this morning to catch a train. Williams Talks. He was asked how he got out of Bux-1 hie .latoyei instiuctions foi the time being, Team Ran Away. Afterwards, when Chief Gray ques tioned him, Williams said that just as he was getting out of Coleman's bug gy in Albia one of the horses became frightened, and they jerked away from him and ran away, and he claims he does not know what became of them.

He has a very prominent scar just below his left ear and the marks of several threads where it had been sewed to gether are very plain. He wore a dark coat and vest, a checked pair of trousers, and the most characteristic of all was the remark made to Captain Gallagher shortly after he had been arested, when he said 'Now you've got me, the next thing to do is to get loose. I've got nothing at all to say." ocx^oooooooooooooooooooo PEOPLE'S PULPIT. 8 oUOOXOOOOOOOOOOOCXXXXXX)8 Practical Results. It has been said that equal suffrage would lead to no practical benefits. Let us see. We have the undoubted evi dence of those who stand highest both in social and official positions in the states where women have and exer cise the franchise equality with men. Please let me quole a few lines from some of them. The following was passed avowing the success of woman suffrage in Colorado: "Whereas, equal suffrage has been in operation in Colorado for live years, during which time women have exer cised the privilege as generally as men, with the result that better candi dates have been selectd for office, ness by political responsibility there fore be it. "Resolved, by the House of Repre sentatives. the Senate concurring, that, in view of these results, the en franchisement of women in every state and territory of the American union is recommended as a measure tend ing to the advancement of a higher and better social order. That an au thenticated copy of this resolution be forwarded by the governor of the state to the legislature of every state and territory, and that the press be equested to call public attention to these resolutions." This seems strong enough endorse ment. Now as to practical benefits, I quote from reports of legislative work done in the state since women have been members of the law work ing body. "Colorado owes to her women the laws raising the age of protection for girls to 18, establishing a state board of arbitration, a state industrial school for girls and a state home for depend ent children removing the emblems from the Australian ballot (the near est approach to an educational quali fication for suffrage), making fathers and mothers joint guardians of their children, enlarging women's property rights, introducing the indeterminate sentence so much desired by the friends of prison reform, and provid ing an annual appropriation to buy books for the state library also in Denver, ordinances placing drinking fountains in the streets, forbidding expectoration in public places and re quiring smoke-consuming chimneys on all public and business buildings." In addition the last legislature pass ed the following bills for which many organizations of women had asked—a law establishing parental schools, an other for the care' -of the feeble-mind ed, several humane society bills, a bill for the preservation of forest trees, the eight hour law, a bi-weekly pay day. and a bill requiring insurance companies that have to he sued to re cover, to stand cost of suit. Among other results of equal suffrage is a much better enforcement of laws re quiring merchants to furnish seats to women clerks, prohibiting the em ployment of children under sixteen, regulating the sale of tobacco to min ers and others of the same character. Equal suffrage has made more order ly and improved the primaries and made it hard to elect a bad man to office. In Wyoming, equal suffrage caused the passage of a law that men and women in the employ of the state shall receive equal pay for equal work. In Utah, equal suffrage has caused the passage of a law that female teachers in the public schools shall receive the same pay as male teachers provided they hold certificates of the same grade, also for improved sanitary ar rangements in the schols. In Idaho equal suffrage has caused the passage of a bill establishing state library commission, two mem bers of which must be women the repeal of the law licensing gambling. Among the results common to all the enfranchised states are the mak ing of elections more orderly, stimu lating women's interest in public af fairs, improving the class of candi dates nominated and increasing the number of women serving on educa tional and charitable boards. While Williams was being taken from the jail to the depot this morn ing he was interviewed by a Courier reporter. He said his home was in Alabama, and that he had been in Bux ton about nine months. He said he had been employed as a teamster at the mines in that city, and that he had also been employed as stable foreman. He said he was in Buxton at the time the murder of Sharpless was commit ted, but he refused to. say anything uIat"are*"nowC be'lng^pressed upon "the about the deed. When asked if tiieie country, some of them by men who was any trouble between him and Sharpless and he said there was none. I 0n *°A il!®, 7-^" foregoing editorial appears an article from the Hartford Courant comment he said that he drove to Albia in Cole man's buggy. At this point Attorney Woodson, who was with the party, told Williams not to talk any more about the crime, and the colored man obeyed Emily Phillips. Protection and Reciprocity. Ottumwa, la., Dec. 9. 1901. Editor Courier:—In the Courier of Saturday evening appeared an editorial containing the following: "The present tariff that has given such excellent results—prosperity and wide employment of labor where there had been prior to its adoption, hard times and little remuneration to labor —is to be attacked in the present con gress and in the house of Its friends. Representative .Babcock, of Wisconsin, mistakes the true meaning of recipro city as declared for by McKinley and by President Roosevelt, a*d if his the ories were carried put there would be little left of the protective features o£ the Dingley tariff but all these would be lost in the reciprocity measures never been friendly tl.ln of ulotection to the doc- the same page containing the ing on an eastern interview with Gov ernor-elect Cummins. A portion of the article is here reproduced, the heading used by the lug ltg approvai 0f Courier evidenc- the substance: 

"SOME SOUND ADVICE.' "Governor Cummins of Iowa, who has 90,000 republican majority behind him, has been telling the President how the republicans feel whom he comes in contact with. What he says deserves careful reading all over the country and by none more carefully than by those who are really depend ent upon the protective tariff. They Williams is a coal black negro,about must find some way to separate their •"'fe c. tov» ilvi 1 interests from the interests of those who no longer need protection and who are only using the tariff for their own benefit and against the interests of the consumer. "Here are two propositions that the governor laid down and they certainly have a reasonable sound. Speaking for the people of his part of the coun try, he says: 'They will not long endure paying for home-made protected goods high er prices than those goods are sold for abroad. 'They want competition In all the goods which they consume, and if they cannot get competition at home, they want the tariff reduced so that it may come from abroad.'" Again, the last, republican state plat form contained the following: "We stand by the historic policy of the republican party in giving protec tion to home industries. We favor such changes in the tariff from time to time as becomes advisable through the progress of our industries and their changing relations to the com merce of the world. "We endorse reciprocity as the nat ural complement of protection, and urge its development. "We favor any modification of tariff schedules that may be required to pre vent their affording shelter to monop oly." As I understand the matter, Con gressman Babcock favors the removal methods of election have been purified the character of legislation improved, of the duties on trust made goods, par civic intelligence increased and worn-1 ticnlarly the coarser products of iron anhood developed to greater useful- an(j gteel, things which no longer need protection and which are sold abroad for less than at home. His bill has nothing to do with reci procity. But there were several reci procity treaties negotiated by Mr. Kas son.under the direction of the lamented McKinley, and presumably all of them meeting his approval, which have been before the senate for over a year for ratification or rejection. To the average republican layman it is not easy to harmonize the editor ial quoted within the last Iowa state platform, or with the utterances of Cummins, which the Courier appears to endorse. Republicans are protectionists, but no particular tariff schedule is sacred in their eyes and no duties should be allowed to remain that are needed, neither for protection nor for revenue, and there is not now, nor never has been in the past, the slightest danger to the legitimate industries of the country in making the necessary modi fications in the tariff, if made by the friends of protection. If its friends fail to do their duty, its enemies may again be given an opru'tunity to try their hand. H. L. Waterman. Chariton, la., Dec. 9, 1901. Editor Ottumwa Courier:—I, T. D. Crowley, desire to correct a state ment made in your worthy paper by a correspondent., likely of this place. Will say to my friends, including the state superintendent that I was admitted in to the Chariton high school in '98 with the consent of the board of supervis ors. before whom my case was stated by Hon. Hal Larimer again in '99 by consent of the president of the school board, nor was I asked for tuition. On entering school this year I resumed my stud'es for several weeks, until Superintendent Morris requested me to get a receipt for my-tuition of the secretary of the board. On my offer ing the tuition to the secretary, he re fused it saying that it was against the law for a person over 21 years of age to attend the public schools under any condition, unless he had been a soldier in the United States army. For two weeks I was out of school, and it was through the efforts of County Superin tendent C. F. Goltry, that I succeeded in convincing the board of its mistake. However, they demanded all back tu ition, which was immediately paid. In conclusion I will say that the board of '98 knew my age and nothing was said concerning it. I am glad the people of Chariton have civilized me. T. D. Crowley.

EISTEDDFOD Coming Meeting to be a Great Success. COMPETITION WILL BE KEEN Session in This City December 25— Three Meetings Will Be Held—An Excellent Program is Offered—Ot tumwans to Compete. All indications point to one of the most successful meetings of Its his tory, when tho Eisteddfod association of Iowa convenes in this city Christ mas day. When the meeting last year had been brought to a most successful climax, the members of the association ere well satisfied, but with their prospects for this year, they feel that they will more than duplicate last ear's great meeting. An excellent program has been arranged and it is certain that there will be a great many more contestants this year than last. Especially is this true in the chief choral competition. Last year there were but two entries. Williamsburg and Hiteman. This year there will be at least three. Last year's foes will enter, and a chorus from Ottumwa, under the leadership of Mrs. Frances Clarke will also try for the big prize. Last Year's Winner. Last year Williamsburg came to Ot tumwa with a special train and over 100 visitors and carried off nearly all the prizes. They are endeavoring to duplicate their performance this year. They will have practically the same chorus that they had last year and have been practicing for a long time. The Hiteman contingent has its eyt? on the big prize, and while it was yn successful last year, it has been doing some extra hard practice and it feels that it stands a good show to beat its old time rival this year. It is prob able that the Hiteman delegation will charter a special train, and it is prac tically sure that it will be represented by 200 or 300 people. A New Richmond. There will be a new Richmond in the field this year that may upset the calculations of the former contestants. Ottumwa will be represented in the big event, and it is certain that its chorus will be first-class. Mrs. Fran ces Clarke has undertaken the train ing of singers to enter in the big event, and she feels sure that she has a chorus that will acquit itself with credit. She has been drilling it for several weeks, and hopes by Christ mas to have reached a high state of efficiency. Three Sessions. Ex-mayor Thomas J. Phillips of this city, is president of the association and he is laboring hard for (the suc cess of the coming meeting." This is his second year at the head of the or ganization, and it is his desire that as good a showing as possible be made. It was due largely to his effort that this year's meeting was secured for this city. There will be three ses sions of the association. The first will be at 10 o'clock in the morning, the second at 1:30 o'clock in the afternoon and the third at 7:30 o'clock in the ev ening. The Officers.
