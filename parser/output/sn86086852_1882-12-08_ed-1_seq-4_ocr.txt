Tbo following annual message was delivered to both houses of the 47tb congress immediately upon their re assembling on Monday. The President’s Message. INTRODUCTION. To the Si., tte and Honnt of Repre.*eu(at i eet of lit Unit' and State*: Washington, Doc. 4. It is provided by lie. •onstituiion that the president shall, fr*m tim e to time, f ivc congress information of the state of .ne unio.i and recommend to their consideration such mcasi-es jhe shall judge need ’a y and ex pedient. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. In re scw.ng the even s of the year whch has clapped since the commencement <J the parent session, 1 feel gratified in caP'ng your attention tc the condition of our foreign affairs. Our in tercourse with other power* has continued to be of the most friendly character Such slight difference as have arisen during •lieyear, have been already settled cr likely to each an early adjustment. The a est of. n(izens of the United State* in Ireland, under thc iccent Uwh which owed their origin to the dis turbed condition of that country, ha* led to a Somewhat extended correspondence with the gov rnment of Hreat lirita ; n, and a disposition tc respect our rights has been practically manifist ed by the release of the a/rcsted pr-tioa. THE ISTHMUS CANAL. The clam of the nation in regard the su pervision and central of any inter-oceanic canal across the American isthmus has continued to be* the subject of conference. It is likely that ; irr will be more powerful than discussion in remov ing the divergence between tho two nations whose friendship is so closely connected by the intimacy of their relations and community of their interest. Our >ong established friendliness with Russia has remained unbroken. K has prompted mo to proffer the earnest counsel of this government that measures bo adopted for suppressing the proscription which the Hebrew race in (hat country has lately suffered. It ha* not tran spired that any American citizen lias been sub jtcUd to Injury, and our.coir icons remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. There in rear on in the belief that the time is not tar distant when Kuchih will be able lo secure toleration of all faiths within her border. INTERNATIONAL TRADE MARKS. At an international convention held in Paris in find attended by representatives f the United Suites, an agreement was reached in re- Mpect to tho protection of trade murks on patent ed articles mid rights of manufacturing Anns, and the co-operstion of scientists in the adoption of a common meter to mcmaro electric force. In view of tho frequent occurrence of confer cnees for the consideration of important matter* of common irrerest f> civi ized nations, I re npecttully suggest that the executive bo invested by congress with discretionary power to send delegates to sue conventions, and that pro vision be made to defray expenses incident thereto. TROUBLE WITH BPAIN. The difference between the United States and Spain a* to the eff. ct of a judgment and a cer tificate of naturalization has not yet been adjust ed, but it is hoped and believed negotiations now in progress will result in tho establishment of a position which seems to this government, reason able and just. 1 have already called the attention of congress to the fact that in the iiorts of Spain and its col onies fees have lately been imposed upon vessel* ofthoUn'iel States for trivial wffeusos against local regulation*. Kffort* tor tho abatement of there exactions h ive thus far proved unsuccess ful. I regret to inform you also that the fees do* iiiandcd by Spanish consul* in American pons arc in soino cases so large when compered with the value of the cargo a.* to amount, in effect, to u considerable export duty, and that our reinon stranees in this regard have not as yet recetv* •* attention whore they deserved it. GERMAN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION The Herman government has invited the I States to participate in an international exhibi tion of domestic cattle, to be held *n Hamburg, in duly, 1883. If th : s country is to be repre sented, it is important that in the early days of this session, cingress should make an apprup’i slion for that purpose. bkmuvh. The extradition convention with lltdgium, which line been in operation since 1874, ban been ately supplemented by another. The senate has ’ignified its approval and ratifications have been Inly exchanged between the contracting coun tries. To the list of extraditable crimes has been •titled that of assassination or attempted assasgi i tuion of the chief ol slate. SWITZERLAND* Negotiations have been opened with Switior tand looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether its citizens can renounce their allegiances and become citizens of the United Slate*. lam happy to inform you that the im migration of pauper* ami criminal* from certain of the cantons of Swilzerlnrd have substantially ■eared, ami i* no longer sanctioned by the uu • hollies The consideration of this subject prompts the suggestion that the act of August 3d. 1882, which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to their on a countiy, should ho so modified as not to ho open to f and. It nflee ■ the extradition of crlir'nnli on profe. ed charge > of crime TUI OTTOMAN roKTR ha* m t yet seated to the interpretation which ibis govcMin ent has put up n the treaty of 1830, relative to it* jurisdictions l right- in To-key. It •nar well bo said, however, tha. this difference win be adjusted by a general revision of the sys tem id' Jurisdiction of the United Stales in the cm' uvies of the cast, a subject to which ynu" at tention lias he *n already ended by the secretary of state. THINKS* INDEMNITY POND. In the interest of justice toward China and Japan I fruit that the question id the return of the indemnify fund to the governments of those countries will fie readied at the present sea; 'on, and the satisfactory solution made which I have already recommended and which ha* recently been foirsliadowed by congress. 

COREA. The treaty lately concluded with Corea await* the action of the senate. EUVPT. I Hiring the late disturbance in Kgvpt, the timely presence of American vessels .erved ass protection to the persons and property of many ol our own citizens and of citizens of o In r countries whose governments have expressed th.ir thanks for tl.is assistance. THE CHINESE UI’ESTION. The recent legislation restricting immigration id laborers from China has given ise to the question of whether Chinese proceeding to and Irom another country may lawfully pass through our own in construing the not of May fith, 1882, in connection with the treaty of Nov. Tth, ISSO, the restriction would seem to he limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and should not forbid a mere transit across our territory. 1 ask the attention of eon gicss to the subject (or such action, if any, at may he deemed advisable, LtssaiA. This government has recently had occasion to manifest interest in the republic of Liberia by seeking to aid the amicable settlement ot the boundary dispute now passing between that re public and the liritish possesion of Sierro Leon HAWAII. The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will be come terminated after September 0. 1883, or two months' notice by cither party. While certain provisions of that "compact may have proved omy morons, its existence has fostered com mercial relations which it is important to pre serve. I suggest, therefore, that early considera tion be given to such mollification of the treaty as seem to be demanded by the interests ol our people. •lIAVTI AND BAN DOMINGO. in view of our increasing trade with both llay ti and Ban Domingo, I advise that provision bt made for diplomatic intercourse with the latter by enlarging the aeope of the mission at Port su Prince. I regret thst a certain class of Ameti osn citizens arrayed against the government of llayti, have thus far been urged unavailingly to desist. ITALY. Tlie death of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that government ex pressions of profound respect for his exalted •haracter and lor his honorable care in the diplo matic service of his country. The Italian fjov rament has raised a question zi to the propiietv •it ■V-V.guixing in his duel capacity the repre sentative ot this country recently accredited both as secretary of legation and a< consul-general at Koine. He has been received a secretary, bu. bis exequatur as consul-general iiae thus fex been Withheld. MEXICO. A recent agreement with Mexico provides fir tbs crossing of the frontier by the armed forces of either country in pursuit of hostile Indiana In my message last year I called attention to the prevalent lawlessness on the border* and to the necessity of legislation tor its suppression. I again invite the attention of congress to the sub ject. A partial relief from these mischiefs has oeen sought in a convention which now has the approval of the eenate and awaits fathw action, vs does another touching the establishment of the international boundary between tkw United State* and Mexico. If the latter is ratified the action of congress will be required for -***klit v ing suitable commissions of surrey. The bo—d ary dispute between Mexico and Uuataznala, which led this government to proffer its friendly counsel* to both parties, ha* been amicably set tled. >RM*ZDILA. No change has ooeuired is car relations with Venezuela. I again invoke ;nr action to the matter of the pending award* against that repub lic to which retcreneo was made b; a special mes sage from the executive at your last session. An invitation has been receiver from the government of Vsnexaela to send representatives in July, ISS3, to participate in the Centennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American independence. In connection with the event, it is designed to commemorate the erection at Caraeolei of a statute of Washington and to conduct an industrial exhibition which will be open to American products. I request that the Lnited States be represented and that suitable ‘provirioi be made therefor. CEKTCAL AMEBICA. The elevation of aur mission in C-mt al Amer ica, the plenipotentiary rank of whies was au thorised by congress at its late s<s ion, has been since effected. PESO, BOLIVIA AKO CHILI. The wsr between Pern and Bolivia on the oou, ime, and Chili on the other, began more than' .wo years ago by the occupation by Chili in ISBO of all thelatteral territory of Bolivia. Ne gotiations for peace were conducted under the direction of the United States. The others re fused to concede any territory, but Chili has einco become master of the whole coast of both countries and of the Capitol of Peru. A year since, as you have already been advised by correspondence transmitted, to you in January last, this government sent special mission to the bsliggerant powers to tl-i prc.is the hops that Chili would be disposed to ac-J cept a money indemnity for the expenses of thc{ war and to relinquish her demand for a portion of the territory fer her antagonist. This recom mendation. which Chili declined to follow, this, government did not sL'imt to enforce nor can it be enforced without resort to. measures which would be in keeping neither with the temper of our people nor with, the spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru no longer extends over its whole territory, and in the event of our interference to dictate peace, it would need te be supplemented by the army and navy of the United States. Such in terference would almost inevitably lead to the establishment of a protectorate, a result utterly at odds with ou" past policy, injurious to our present interests, and lull of embarrassments for the future lor the termina-, lion of hostilities on towns, at once, just to the victorious nalien,and generous to its adversaries. This government has spared no effort a to save such as might involve the complications which 1 bare indicated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chili seems resolved to exact such rigorous condi tions of peace and is indisposed to submit to arbi tration tbo terms of an amicable settlement. No' peace is likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equitable and just to command the approval of other nations. 

WASHINGTON PEACE CONFLUENCE. About a year since invitations were extended the nations of Ibis continent to send representa tives to a peace congress to assemble at Wash ington in November, 1882. The time of meeting was fixed at a period then remote in the hope, as the invitation iteJf declared, that in the mean time the disturbances between South American republics would be adjusted. As that expecta tion seemed unlikely ts be realized, I asked in April last for an expression of opinion from the two houses of congress, as to the ad visability of holding the convention at the time appointed. This action was prompted in part by doubts which mature reflection had suggested, whether diplomatic usage and the traditions of the government did net make it fitting that the executive should consult the representatives of the people before pursuing a fine of policy some what novel in its character and far reaching is its possible consequences. In view of the fact that no action was taken by congress in the premises, and no provision had been mado for] necessary expenses, I subsequently decided to postpone the and so notified the several governments which had been invited to attend. lam unwilling to dismiss this subject without assuring you of my support of any measures congress may devise for the promotion of peace on this continent, and throughout the world, and I trust that the time is near, when with the universal asent of civilized people, all international differences will be determined with out resort to arms by the benignant process o! arbitration. DIPLOMATIC CHANCES. Changes hav . occurred in the diploma ie repre sentation of several foreign powers during the past year. New ministers from the Argentine Republic, Austria, Hungary, Brazil, Chili, China France, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Prussia have presented their credentials. The missions of Denmark and of Venezuela at this capital have been raised in grade. Switzerland has created a plenipotentiary mission to this point, and an embassy from Madagascar and a minister from Spain will shortly ar rive. Our diplomatic intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment of relations with tho new kingdom of Servia, by the creation of a mission to Siam and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. The Shah of Persia has expressed bis gratification that a charge d’ affairs will shortly be sent to that country where tho lights of of our citizens have been courteously guarded by the representatives of Great Britain. COLLISIONS AT SEA. I renew my recommendation of such legisla tion as will place the United States in harmony with other powers in respect to international rules for tho prevention of collisions at sea. In conformity with your joint re olulion of the 3d of August last, I have directed the secretary of •date to address foreign governments in respect *-o a proposed eonferenej for constJiring tho subject of the universal adoption of a common prime .'meridian to bo used in tho rcokoningof longitude and tho regulation of time throughout •ho civilized world. Their replies will, in due lime, be laid before you. INTERCHANGE OE NATIONAL DOCUMENTS. An agreement was retched at Paris, in 1875. between the principal powers fur the interchange of official publications through tho medium of itheir respective foreign departments. This ad fuiirablo custom, which has been built up by 4 lko enterprise of the Smithsonian institute, offc-ed U practical basis for our co-operation in this hchemc, and an arrangement has been effected by whieh that institution will perforin tho necessary labor by direction of the department of state. ,A reasonable compensation therefor should be provided by law. THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. A clause of tho act making appropriations for tho diplomatic and consular fervico, contemplates She reorganization of both branches of such ser vice on a salaried basis, leaving fees to inure to the benefit of tho treasury. I cordially favor such a project as likely to oorrect abuses in the present system. The secretary at state will pre sent to you at an early date, a plan for such or ganization. THE

ISS2. was $321,056 453. f recommend to your attention the secretary’s views in respect to the likelihood of a serious c- n tractinn of this circulation, and the modes bv which thav result may be in his judgment averted. MLVCB CERTIFICATE* AND COINAGE OF SILVER. In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and ’.be retirement of silver certificates, I have seen nothing to alter, but much to confirm the senti ment: to which I gave expression last year. A comparison between the respective amounts of river dollar circulation on November, ISSI, and on November, 1882, shows a slight increase of a million and a half dollars, but daring the inter val there had been in the whole number coined an increase of twenty-six millions of the one hundred and twenty-eight millions thus far minted. A little more than thirty five millions are in circulation. The mass of accumulated coin has grown so great that the vault room at present available for stor age is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is nut apoarent why it is desirable to continue the coin age now so enormously in excess of public de mand. As to the silver certificates, in addition to ihe grounds which seemed last year to justify their retirement, may be mentioned the effect which is likely to ensue from the supply of gold certificates, for the ssuance of which congress recently made provision, and which arc new m active circulation. THE 

EEDDCTION OF BEVENfES. You cannot fail to note with interest the dis cussion by the secretary a; to the necessity of providing by legislation toms mode of freeing the treasury of an excess of as-cts in he event that congress foils to reach an early agreement for the refaction of taxation. I hereby approve the secretary’s recommendation f an imneiiate and extensive reduction in tie annual revenues of the government. It will be remembered that I urged upon congress at its lost session the im-. purtanec of relieving the industry and enterprise > of the country from the pressure of unnecessary taxation. It is one of the truest maxims of polit ical economy that all taxes a-o burdensome, however; wi.ely and prudently imposed, and though there have always been among our peo ple wide differences of smliment as to the best methods of raising the national revenue, and in deed as to the principles upon which taxation should he based there has been substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to bo levied es are necessary for the wise and economi cs administration of government. Of late the public revenues have exceeds I that limit, and un less cheeked py appropriate legislation, such ex-, cess will continue to increase froa year to year For til l fiscal year ended June 30th, 1881, the surp’us was more than $145,000,000 The report of the secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moneys. They have not only an swr red the requi ements of the sinking fund but have afforded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the public debt. Bat I renew the rip res; ion of the conviction that such rapid cx tinguhhment of the national indebtedness as is now taking place is by ito means a cause for con gratulations. It is a cause rather for serious ap prehension. If it continues, it must speedily be Ifollowed by one of th ise evil results so clearly set forth in the report of the secretary; cithc.' the surplus must be idle in the treasury, or tho government will bo forced to buy at market rates its bonds not then redeemable, and which, under such circum stances, cannot fail to command an enormous premium; or the smaller revenues will be devoted to extravagant expenditures whieh. as experi ence has taught us, la ever tho bane of the over flowing treasury. It was made apparent in the course of the an imated discussion which this question aroused at the last session of congress that the policy of diminish ng the revenue by reducing taxation commanded gi ncral approval of the members of both hetuct. I regret that b cause of the conflict ions as to the be.-t methods by which that policy should be mado operative, mure of its benefits have not been reaped. lu fulfilllment of what I deem my constitutional duty, hut with little hope that I can make valuable contribution to this vexed question, I shall proceed to mtimato briefly my own views in relation to it. pr ehi dent Arthur’s plan fob reducing TAXATION. Upon the showing of our 1' ifiancial condition at the close of the last fiscal year, I felt justified in recommending to congress the abolition of inter ..ai rev n-e. cjn lon ipci i..i> i.c.i m •. nous f. :n ail upon .'i lie I spirits an •'• i me led ' i and •■v.vp* a .-o th- special in upon the manufacturer and dealer- in such arl etc* 1 \- ii on i oit lu suggest that unics.- it shad ho a.-ci itamled that the probable expendi lures of the government f r the coining year have been under estimated the interal taxes, save those which rel.ue to distilled spirits, can be pru dently abrogate!. Such a reduction, accompanied by a simplifica tion of the machines of collection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reason ably be expected to result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at least two millions and a half of dollars and in the retirement from office frvtn 1,500 to 2,000 persons. The system of ex cise duties has never esmmended itself to the fa vor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying deficiencies in the treasury, when, by reason ot special exigen cies, the duties on imports have proved inade quate to the needs of the government. The sentiment of the country doubtless com-, mends the present excise law shall bo abolished as soon as such course can safely bo pursued. It seems to me, however, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure, as the total abolition oi in to tal tax, would for the present bo an unwise step. Two ot those reasons are deserving of special mention: First, it is by no moans clear that even if the existing system of duties oi imports as contin ued with tit modification, that those duties alone will yield sufficient leventte for all the needs of the government. It is estimated that one hun dred millions of dollars will ho required for pension •- during the coming year, and it may we I he doubted whether the maximum annual de mand f"r that object has yet been reached. Un certainty upoa this question would alone justify in my judgment the retention for the present cf that portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Second, a total abolition of excise taxes would almost prove a serious, if not unsurmount able, objection to a thorough revision of the tariff, and to any considerable reduction in im port duties. THE 

PRESENT TARIFF SYSTEM is, in many respects unjust. It makes an une qual distribution both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact was especially recognised by a majority of each house of the pas sage of the act creating the tariff commission. The report of that commission will bo placed be fore you at the beginning of this session and will, I trust, afford you such information ai to the condition and prospects of the various commer cial, agricultural, mining, manufacturing and other interests of the country, and contain such suggestions lor statuUry revision as will practi cally aid your action upon tips important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870, amounted to $137,000,000. It has in the three succeeding years reached first, $186,000,000, then $193,000,000, and final ly, as has been already stated, $220,000,000. The income from this service for the fiscal year which will end on June 30th, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess of the sum last men tioned. If the lax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reduc tions from the customs revenue are entirely feasi ble. While recommending this reduction, I am tar fiotn advising the abandonment of the policy if discriurnating in the adjustment of the dciaiU to as to afferu aid and protection to domestic labor. Hut the present system should be so revised as to equalize the public’s burden among all classes and occupations, and bring it into closer har mony with the present nee is of the public intcrest- Without entering into minute details which, under present circumstanets, is quite unnecessary, I recommend an cn'argcment of the free list so as to include within it the numerous articles which yield considerable revenue, a simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule of duties upon certain manufactures, and particu larly those upon cotton, inn and steel, aid a substantial reduction of duties upon those ar ticles, and upoa sugar, molasses, silk, wool and woile-n goods. It a central revision of the tariff shall be found to le imprac icable at this session, I express the hope that at least some of the more conspicuous inequalities of the present law may he corrected before your fiaal adjourn ment. One of them is especially referred to by the secretary. In view of a recent deci ion of the supreme court the necessity cf amending the law by which the dat es on ’ standard ot c -lor is adopted as the test of saccharine string!h of tugars. is too obvious to require comment * THR WAR

The matter bai already been the su l j -t o' disc ission in the senate and a bill which wb i. oipp'y the deficiencies ol existing laws is aev o-i its calendar. ttrutstsT or aimt orncm The ccretaiy of war calls at ration to the 'act •,’uat an mbarrassment growing oat of the re .nt act of congress, making he retirement ot officers of the army compulsory at the age of 64, with the act of IS7S, is still ia force, which limi > to four hundred the number ol those who can be retired for disability or upon their own applica tion. The two acts, when const rod ogetber. seem to forbid the retiring, even for absolute in capacity, of officers who do not fall within th - purview of the latter statute, at such times as there chance to be lea than 400 names on the retired list. There are now 420. It is not likely that congress intended this result, and I concur with the recretary that the law ought to be amended. SEVER AND HAKEOR BILLS. m The grounds that induced me to withhold m y signature from the bill entitled : “An act mak ing appropriations for the construction, repair and preservation of certain works on rivers ana harbors,” which became a law near the close of your sea don. prompt me to express the opinion that no similar measure will be deemed necessary during the present session of congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged on your attention. Inm informed by the secretary of war that the greater portion ot !he sum appnpriated for the various items specified in that act remains unexpended. The new works, for which authorized expenses have beca incurred, are only two. for which the total ap propriation was $216,000. The present available balance is disclosed by the following tables; Amount of appprooriation by act of August 2,1882 $18,738,875 Amount of appropriation by act of June 19. 1532 10,000 Amount of appropriation for payments to J. B. Eado 304,000 Unexpended balance of tormtr appropriation 4,738,253 Total 23,791,138 L ss amount drawn from treas ury between Ju’y 1,1882, atd November 30, 1882 6,056.194 Total 17,734,944 It is apparent by this exhibit that so far concerns most of the items to which the act of August 2nd, 1882 relates, there can be no need of farther appropriations until after the close oft) c present session. If, however, any action should be nece,Bj,ry in respecti to par tcular objects it would be entirely feasible to provide for those ob jects by appropriate legis'ation, It is possible, tor example, that a delay until the assembling ol the next congress to make additional provig’on; for the Mississippi river improve ment might be attended with serious con sequences. If such should appear to be the case, a just bill relating to that subject would command my approval. This leads me to offer a suggestion wruch I trust will commend itself i the wisdom of congress. Is it n< t advisable that the grants of large sums of money for divers and indepen lent tehem s of internal improvement should be ma le the subjects of separate and dis tinct legislative enactments. It will hardly be gainsaid even ' y 'hose who favor the most liberal expenditures fur such purposes as are sough to be accomplished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that the practice ot group ing in such a hill appropriations for a groat di versity of objects widely separated either in their nature or ths locality with which they are con cerned, or in both, as one w hich is much to be deprecated, as its inevitable tendency is to secuie the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separately considered, could scarce ly fail of rejection. By the adoption of the course I have recommended, every member of congress when an opportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote fur meritorious appropriations, would bo enabled so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving of his ap proval. So, also, would the executive be afforded full opportunity to exercise his constitutional pre rogative of opposing whatever appropriations seemed to him objectionable, without imperilling the success of others which commended themselves to his judgment. It may be urged in opposition to these suggestions that the namber of works of internal improvemmt which are justly entitled to governmental aid is so groat as to render imprac ticable separate appr-priation bills therefor, at and even for such comparatively limited number ss make dispositiem of large sums of money. This ■bjeetion may be well founded, and whether it le or not, the advantages that would be likely to ensue by the adoption of the course I have re commended may perhaps be mere effectually a*- lained by another which I respectfully submit to congress as an alternative proposition. It is provided by the constitutions of 14 of our states that the executive may disapprove anv item or items of a bill appropriating money whereup- n part of the bill approved shall be law and the part disapproved shall fail to became law, unless repas-ed, according to the provision prescribed tor the pa-sage ol bills < ver the veto of the executive. The slates wherein some such provisions, as the lorcg-ing, is a fundamental law, are Alabama, Coh ratio, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, M ss.otri. Nebraska, New Jitsey New York, Pen s tvaida and West Virginia. THE 

NAVV. The report of the secretary of the navy states the movements of the various squadrons dur ing the year, in h mi and foreign waters, where 0 i officers and seamen, with such ships as we pnsess, have co tinned to illustrate the high •>r tractor and excellent discipline of the naval 1 jtan’zatioa THE JEANNETTE. On the 12itof Decembc , lSSl,iuioimation was received :ha the exploring steamer Jeannette had been c-ushed end abandoned in the arctic cccau. The officers and crew, af;o- a journey over the ice, embarked in three boats for the' coasts of Siberia. One of the parties under the c. tnmand of Chief Engineer George W. Melville, reached the land and tailing in with natives was saved. Another under Lieutenant Commander DoLong, landed in a barren egion near the mouth oi tlie Lena river. After six weeks had elapsed, aitbut two of the number had died from fatigue and starvation. No iidi tgs have been re ceived from the pa-ty in the third boat under the command of Lieut. Chipp, but a long and fruitless investigation, leaves little doubt that all its num b* • perished ,n .he sea. Asa slight tribute to their ha-oism I give in this communieateon the names of the gallant men who sacrificed their lives in the expedition: Lieut. Com. Geo. W. Delong; Surgeon J. M. Ambler; J. J. Collins, Hans 11. Erickson, Her wyck Kaacl i,fieo. A. Bride, Walter Lee, Adolph Driscoll, Carl A. Gortz, Nelse Sverton, H. E. Cook, A. 11. Sactan and the Indian Alec. The officers and men in the miss ing beat were: Lieutenant Chas. W. Chipp, commanding; Win. Keerbar, Alfred Watkinson, Wall. Sbotbcll, Albert C. Kulhne, Edwin Star. Henry Warren and Peter E. (Johnson. Lieut. Giles B. Hasher and Master W. 11, Schautskisch are now bringing home the remains of Lieut. Do Long and his comrades. In pursuance of the direction of cong.ess the Rodgers, fitted out for the relief of the Jeanette in accordance with the act of congress of March 3d, 1881, sailed from San Francisco June 16 un der the command of Lieut. Robert M. Berry. On Nov. 30th she was accidentally destroyed by fire while it winter quarters of St. Lawrence Bay, but | fflceisand crew succeeded in cscapingfto the land. Lieutenant Berry and one of his officers alter making a search for the Jeannette along the coast of Siberia, fell in with Ch ef Engineer Melville’s party, and returned home by way of Europe. The other officers and crew oi tic Rodgers wore brought f.om St. Lawrence Bay bv the whaling steamer North Star. Mr. Cl •• A. Itulmau, who had been placed in charge ol a de pot of supplies at Cape Zorifarc, returning to his post from St. Lawrence Bay in a blinding aw storm, was carried out to sea and lost, notwith standing all eflorts to rescue him. It appears by the secretary’s report that the THE NATT AND THE COMMERCIAL MARINE, and invites attention to the continued decadence of the latter and the corresponding transfer of our growing commerce to foreign bottoms. This subject is one of the utmost importance to the rational welfare. Methods of reviving American 'hip building and of restoring the United States Hug on the ocean carrying trade should receive the immediate attention of congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of modern iron steamships in fair, competition with our commercial rivals. Our dis advantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor and sailing them, high tax and greater in i crest on capital. While the ocean highways are already monopolized by cur formid able competitors, these obstacles. should in some way be overcome, and for rapid commu nication with foreign lands we should not continue to depend wholly on vessels built in the yards of other countries and sailing un dcr foreign flags. With no United States steamer on the Drincip.il 'ecan lines, or for any foreign parts, our facili ties for extending our commerce are greatly re stricted, while the nations which build the 'ships -r.d carry the mail and passengers, obtain there by conspicuous advantages in t rade. THE POSTOFFICE DEPASTMEST. The report of the postmaster general gives evi dence of the satisfactory condition of that depart ment, and contains many valuable data and sug gestions which cauuot fail to be of interest. The information which it affords, that the receipts for the fiscal year have exceeded expenditures, must be very gratifying to congress and to the pceple of the country. At matters which tnav fairly claim particular attention,lrefer to his observation In reference to the advisability of changing th* p-cv;n* basis for fixing salaries and almwanees, ■>; xteniing the money rdcr system, of eu ' ir g'ng the functions of postal establishments so as to place under its control the tclegrapa sys tem of the country; though from thus last and most important recommendation 1 must with hold my approval. REDUCTION or LKTTEB POSTAGE. At the last session of congress several Mils Were introduced into the house of representa tives for the redaction of letter postage to the r.lcof two one-half ounce. I have given muck study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a re d icticn would be for the best interests of the public. It has been the policy of the govern ment, from its foundation, t defray, as far as possible, the expense of cirrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of postage. It has never boon claimed, however, that this service ought,to. be productive of a net revenue. As has been stated a'ready.'the report of the post master general shows there is now a very consid erable surplus in his department, and that henceforth receipts are likely to increase in a much greater ratio than necessary expenditure. Un less some change is made in the existing laws, the profits of the postal service will, in a very few yea"*, swell the revenues of the government many millions of dollars. The time seems scemr auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in rates of postage. Xa what shall that reduc tion consist? A review o. the legislation whiok hsa been had upon iHs subject during the last '-flirty years discloses that domestic letters consti tute th* only class of mail matter which has never been favored with a substantial redaction •f rates. I am convinced that the burden . f maintaining the services falls most unequally on that class, and that more than any other it is entitled to present relief. That such relief may Ik- extended without detriment to other public in terests vill be discovered by reviewing the resales • f former reductions. Immediately prior to the act of IS 15, the postage on a letter composed ot a single sheet was, via: If conveyed thirty miles or leas, six cents; between thirty and eighty miles. 10 cents; between eighty and one hundred aud fifty miles. 12 m cents; between one hundred and 4fly and tour hundred miles, 13M cants; over four hundred miles, 25 cents. By the act of 1545 the postage on a single letter conveyed for any dis tance under 300 miles, was fixed at five cents, and f any greater distance 10 cents. By the act of tw.hesi provided that a single letterif pre paid, mould be ea-ried any distance not exceed ing 300 nuiot lor three c ■ats. and any greater dis tance six cents. It *iU he noticed that both three reduction acre of a radical character and relatively unite as important ■as that now pro rwei in each ease ihere *t*rsd a temporary as of revenue, hut a sudden mad large influx of b isinsss which paid that loss in three years. Cn lem the experience of past legislation in this country “and elsewhere goes for naught, it may b* safely predicted that a stimulus of a fifty per cent, reduction tax for carriage would at once in crcaso the namber of letters consigned to the mails. The advantages cf secrecy would lead to * very Rcncral substitution of sealed packets for post cards and open circulars, and in divers 0 her ways the volume of first class matter would be enormously augmented. Such an increase amounted in’ England the first year after tha adoption of a penny pas’aero to more than 125 per cent. A s ibe result of a careful estimate, the detals ot which cannot here be sot out, I have become convinced that tne deficiency for tha first year i.ter the proposed reduction would not exceed seven per cent, of expenditures, or $3,660,000, while the deficiency after the reduction of 1845 was more than H per cent, anl after that of 1851 t was 27 percent. 

ANOTHER INTERESTING COMPARISON is afforded by statistics famished me by the post ffiee dena-tment; The act of 1845 was ira*. and in tne face of the fact that there existed a u, fieieicy of more than $30,000. That of 1851 w. encouraged b- the slight surplus of 5132.00 U. The excess of revenue in the next fiscal yea-, is litttly ro he $3,500,000. If congress should Ap prove .hese suggestions, it may be deemed destia ble to supply to some eaten; the deficiency which must for the time result, by increasing . be charge for carrying merchandise, which is now only J 6 rents per pound. But even without such an in crease, I am confident the receip’s under the di minished rates, would equal the expenditures after the lapse of three or four years. TRANSFER OP THE LIGHT HOUSE SERVICE.

THE 

STAR BOUTE CASES. In my message of December last, I referred to pending criminals proceedings growing out of the alleged frauds in what is known as the star route service oi the postoffice department, and ad vised you that t had enjoined upon tha attor ney general and associate counsel to whom the in terests of the government were intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost vigor of the law, all persons who might be found chargeable with those offences. A trial of one of these eases has since cccurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the supreme court of this district, and was conducted with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the jury, but the causes have again been placed upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty persons shall finally escape punishment for their offences it will not be for lack of diligent and urgent work of the prosecution. A BANKRUPT LAW. I truce that some agreement will bereachcd which will speedily aid congress, with the concur rence of the executive, to afford the commercial c.mmunity the benefit of a national bankrupt law. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The report of tho secretary of the interior, with its accompanying documents presents a fuli statement of the varied operations of that depart ment. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has changed or seriously modified tho views to which I devoted much space in a former commmnicarion to corgress. I renew tho recommendations therein contained as to ex tending to the Indians the protection of law, al lotting land in severa'ty to such as deserved it, and making suitable provision for the education of the young. Such provision as the secretary forcibly maintains will prove unavailing unless it is broad enough to include all those who arc able and willing to make use of it, and should not solely relate to intellectual training but also instruction in such manual labor and simple industrial arts as can be made practically available. Among other important subjrcs which are in cluded in the secretary’s report, and which will doubtless .fu-nish occasion tor congressional ac tion, may be mentioned tho neglect of railroad companies, to which large prauls of land were made by acts of 1862 and 1864, to take tho title thereto and their consequent equitable exemption from local taxation. AN ALARMINO STATE OF ILLITERACY. No survey of our material condition can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellect ual progress of the people. The census returns disclose an a'arujing state of illiteracy in certain portions of tho coi utry where the provisions for ■.bhools arc grossly inadequate. It is a mo mentous question for the decision of congress whether immediate substantial aid should be ex tended by tin general government fur the sup plementing efforts of jVva’e benefit -iaries of state and to ritorial legis atiou in behalf ot edu cate n. REGULATION OF INTERNAL COMMERCE. Th) regulation of inter; al commerce basal ready been a subject of your deliberations. On * of the tueid uls of the extinsion of the railw y system of the country has been the adoption <■ "tch measures by corpora!! us which own or co ol tho roads as has tended to impair the a ' an ’. ges of healthful comv.critioa, and make hurtful dt.-crimirations in the adjits meut of freightage. These ineq lalities have bee t corrected in sever.l of the states by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily res r ictad to the limits ct their own territory. Sa far as such mischiefs af fect commerce between states as between any of the states of a foreign couatry, they’ are subjects of national concern, and congress alone can af ford re icf. THE POLYGAMY QUEST.ON. The results which have thus far attended the Viforeemeut of the recent statute for the surg.res kion of polygamy in the territories, are reported by the secretary of tho interior. It is not prob able that any additional legislation ni this regard will be deemed desired until tho effect of existing taws can be more closely observed and studied. I congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision (those laws have been put into operation, are encouraged o believe the evil at "bieh they are aimed may bo suppressed without rest)’. o - nett radical measures as in some quart ■ i have been thought indisp nsible for success. The close elation ot he general government to territorie preparing to be great sta es,may well engage your special attention. It is there In dian disturbances mainly occur, and that polyga my has found Mom for grow b. I cannot doubt 'at a careful smvey of territorial legislation would bo of the highest utility; that thereby life and property would become more secure, the lia bility ol (uibnaks between Indians and whites uJ bo lessened, the public domain would be mote securely governed, and better progress be made on the instinotion of the young.

The report of the commissioner of agriculture presents an account of the labors of that depart ment during the past year, and includes informa tion of much interest to the general public. The condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner in which their destructian is taking place, gives cause for serious apprehension. Their action in pro tecting the earth’s surface in modifying the extremes of climate and regulating and sus taining the flow of springs and streams, is not well understood and their importance in relation to the growth and prosperity of the country can not be safely disregarded. They’ are fast disap pearing before destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our increasing population and their total extinction cannot be long delayed, un less better methods than now prevail shill be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of congress is called to the necessity of additional legislation to preserve valuable forests still remaining on the public domain, especially in the extreme western states and territories, where the necessity for their preservation is greater than in less moun tainous regions, and where the prevailing dry ness of the climate renders restoration, it they are ones destroyed, well nigh impossible. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The communication which I made to congress at i e first ression, in December last, had a some what fni! statement of my sentiments in relation to 'he principles and rules which ought to gov ern appointments to public service. Ke r erring to the various plans which theretofore had been subjected to discussion in the natioaal legislature, plana which were in the main modeled upen the system which has obtained in Great Britain, but which lacked certain promi nent features by which that system i: distin guished, I felt bound to intimate ray doubts whether they or any of them would afford an adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to create. I declared, nevertheless, that il tsis proposed measure rbculd prove tcccptable to congress they would receive the executive signa ture to the suggestions submitted for your con sideration. There hss been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has, in the meantime, been an increase in the public talk on that subject, and the people of the country, apparently with out distinction cl party, nave in variens ways and upon frequent occasions, given expressions i their earnest wish for prompt and definite actior. Iu my judgment such action should no longer K postponed. I may add tnat my own sense of it pie;sing importance has been quickened by ob servation in a practical phase of the matter to which attention has more than once been called by my predecessor. The civil list now comprises about one hundred thousand persons, the larger part of whom most, under the terms of the on s itntion.be selected by the president cither di rectly or through bis own appo ntee*. . jT* the early years of the aimialstration of the government the personal direction of appoint menta in the civil service mav not hare been an irksome task foe the executive, bat now that the burden has increased folly a hundred-fold it has become greater than he ought to bear, and it necessarily diverts his time and attention from the proper discharge of other duliee no leea fell cate and responsible, and which, in the very na ture of things, exnnot he delegated to other hands. la the judgment of not a few who have given study and leffcelion t ■ this ma'te*. the na tion has outgrown the prni ,-i e 1 which the eon-ti tution has e?tab.*bed tor fi .:tg the min i6; sia the public service. Bor. akatev.r may be th reght of the wisdom or expediency of cha >g lit •“ ■ damen at law in to reel'd, it is certain the much rebel may be aSJcitd, not only to the president and to the heads of ’he departments, but to senat-ov aid r presents lifts in congress by discreet legislation. They weuld bo protected is • great measure by the bill new pending before the senate, or by any other which should em body >U important features, from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of ex amining confiding claims and pretentions of candi dates. I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be taken tor the correction of bills which inherit the preson cetnods of appointment, and I assure you of my heady eo-operation in any measures which arc likely to conduce to that end. As to the term and tenor of the official subordinate employes of the government it seems to be generally agreed that whatever their ex tent or charecter, the one should be definite and the other stable and that neither should be regu •ated by the seal in the service of the party or fi delity to the fortunes of an individual. It matters little to the people at large wha competent person is at the head of this depart ment o’ that bureau if they feel 'assured that ths removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the retirement of hontN and j 1 . . subordinate# wh.se duties are purely administrative and have no legitimate connection wtta the triumph of any political party o fae ioj. It is to this latter calsj of officers that the Senate bill to which we have already re lc- -ed exclusively applies, while neitht. thit bi.l nor an- other prominent scheme fo improv ig the civil service conoem* the higher grade • officers who r-c appointe- by the president and confirmed by the ser a;s. THE 

PRESIDENT DEFENDS HIMSELF. I feel bound to comet a prevalent mis apprehension as ;o the frequency with which the presen executive has displaced the incumbent of an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeat.dly alleged that he has in this particular signally departed from the course which jas been pursued under recent administra tions of the government. The facts are as fol- I >ws: The whole number of executive appoint ments during the four years immediately pre ceding Mr. Garfield’s accession to the presidency wa* 2 696; ot this number 244, or 9 per cent., in vi Ived in the removal of previous incumbents. Too ratio of removals to the whole number of ap pointments was much the same during each of those four years. In the first year with 790 ap pointments there were 74 removals, or 8,3 pe* cent; in the second, with 917 appointments there were 85 removals 0r9.3 percent; in thothird. wi h 480 appointments there were 48 removals, or 10 per cent; in the fourth, with 429 appoint ments ihire w ere 47 removals or 8.6 per cent. In the four months of President Garfield’s admicis i- ration there were 390 appointments and 89 re movals, or 22 7 per cent. Precisely he same number of removals, 89, has a-ten place in the founeea months which have iicc elapsed, but they constitute only 7.8 per icut. of the whole number of appointments (1,1 IS) wit!,in that period, and less than 2.6 par cent ot tbs on* re list ol officials (3,459), (exclusive of the ■’ <" and navy, which is filled by presidential appointment). 

POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS. I declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for supplanting the ex isting provisions of the law in relation to politi cal assessments. In July last I authorized a public announcement that employes of the gov ernment should regard themselves as at liberty to exerc’sj ihcir pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard would in no manner affect their (official status. In this announcement I acted upon the view which I had always main tained and still maintain, that a public officer should to absolutely free, as any other citizen, to give or withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation, that such contributions hare at times been ob tained from persons whose only motive for giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refused. ;It goes without saying, that such coutributions are not voluntary.(ln my judg ment, their collection .should be prohibited by aw. A bill which will effectually suppress them wT receive my cordial approval. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. I hope that, however numerous and urgent may be the demands upon yeur attention, be in terests of this district will not be.forgotten. The denial to its residents of the great right of suf frage in all its relation to national, state and municipal rflairs imposes on congress the duty of Effurdisg the best admiiistration which its wis dom can devise. The report of the district commissioners indi cates certain measures whose adoption would seem to be very desirable. I instance in particu lar those which relate to arrears of tax.s, to steam railroads, and to the assessment o. real property. 

COUNT !NG THE VOTES FOR PRESIDENT. Among the questions which have been the topic of recen debate in iho halls of congrers none are of greater gravity tha those relating to the ascertainment ol the vote for president and the intendment of the constitution in its previsions for devolving func tions upon the vice president when the president suffers from inability to d’seharge the powers and duties of his office. I mist that no em barrassment may result flam a future to deter mine these questions before another national election. OUR
