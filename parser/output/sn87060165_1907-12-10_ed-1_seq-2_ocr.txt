OUR BANKS We published in our last issue a statement of the financial condition 'of oar banks, and it is refreshing in these days of commotion elsewhere to know that ajl of our Hnancial in atitutions are sound, solid and safe tlspositories for our people's money, and are under the management o? honest, able and conservative men, and it is to the credit of our people that without the ?lightest pauicy Reeling they are quietly going on with their business, and with abso? lute confidence in our banks t hey are daily depositing their money and getting their discounts. > R003EYELT ON INJUNCTIONS President Roosevelt in his message in treating of the use of the injunc? tion order by the Federal courte, amAcK other things, nays. "Instances of abuse in the granting of injune . nions in labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment ?in the minds of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech uu warrantly restrained continue like? wise to grow. ** But where it is recklessly and unnecessarily used the abuse should be censured. ** The protest is only against the conduct of individual judges in nee-i anticipating final decisions or in the tjranical use of what is nominally a temporary injunction to accomplish ?hat Ib In fact a jiermanent decis? ion." And the President is right. He did not go too fur. if he even went far enough. Some legislative action ^isV?eaentially demanded to curb the United Stat^^^ur^i-jn granting these iiijum*9 ^injunction i order ha? been^Hoeso ela>: far-reaching, that it has served the purpose of a peaw warrant, a writ of habeas corpus, a writ of prohibition The writof injunction has been issu-'i at the call and capri-e of a partisan judge at the instance and beh??st of corporations without reaeou ami without right; and President B velt has sounded the alarm. When the laboring people of this country, when its mechanics and artisans be? come embittered against the United State"*, when they are impressed with the fact that these courts are their enemies and are hostile to their rights, then it will not be well with these courts. On quoting from the President, he s y?: "It would be most unfortunate f - our social welfare if we should permi many honest and law abiding citiz ? - to feel that they had jost cause to- ifgarding our courts withhoetilit. " Ic is. therefore,time for Congre? ? t->act; to enact Buch conservative I gislation that will curb th???ec ?urts aid their judg??e from the re i"-s and tyraniV.? of the writ o'' nntun. The power that they hue now is Bhamefully abused. Let < 'ong - ss limit these pow^BB***fnil .rrrp-ttUese judge? in isjretion an i ?ourts in term to a proper, reaaoi ble and righteous ex? ercise of thesj powers. The writ of injonction wu? never intended tobe used for the purposes and in the cases In which it has been these latter years. Let Congress now, at this sesgion, protect the peo? ple in their rights and liberties from being any further intruded upon by the writ of injunction. There is a well-founded rumor that . the State of West Virginia ha?, un? officially, at present, indicated her willingness to settle without further intervention of the courts the unti bellum debt Bhe owes Virginia. If this be true, and it is highly prob? able, because there ha? been little doubt that the case was lost to Virginia ever since the cause waa re? ferred by the court to a commis? sioner to ascertain and report the amount of alleged indebtedness. Vir? ginia can well afford to meet Weal Virgiuia in a fair spirit of compro? mise. It is regretable,of cour?e.t hat it was ever necessary to bring suit to enforce the payment of a debt so ob? viously due by one State to another, but in ?pite of this Virginia can, if legal proceedings are stopped and the matter settled withou? farther controversy or cost, afford to be ?enient and generous, and there is little doubt that she will be. It is jrtnnate that any sovereign State should permit itself to be sued upon a claim manifestly just, as it unquestionably reflect > upon the credit of ?uch State. West Virginia made a mistake in permitting the suit to be brought, but it will be something at least to her credit if she settles the matter now without allowing the suit to progress to that point where she Will be forced to pay.

The whole country is bowsd with grief, for King OSCST WBB SOI Oscar and Sophia. more than a ruler of his people and had to them as an inti? mate and personal friend. When the flag on the palace was dipped to half mast there was a moan of anguish from the assembled multitude and many of them cried "our dear old king :?!." ion to the throne of Swe? den now 0 ar flaatavs Adol? ka of Veiniland. Wi? oidest son of the Lite king. At a meeting of the council of state the new king took the T>ath of allegiance under the title of Gustave V, and adopted the motto "with the people for the fatherland." The patacas then took the oath of alle? giance and the new monarch accepted of the state officials. The last hours of the expiring mon? arch were passed in unconsciousness "an.-i op to the end he gave no sign of ?hose about him. The grief Stricken because he could not bid her farewell.

There, also, gathered many old men and wo? men in rags, such as the king had al? ways stopped to comfort with mild ind generous alms when he met them in the ' parks or streets, their faces tear-stained because their belov? ed king and benefactor was dying. Sud? denly the flag droped to half mast and a wail of misery and sorsow arose. The f.;d folks clasped their hands and prayed and wept aloud, and the school boys' lamentations were pitiful to hear. In a room near the death chamber the first marshal of the court read to the cabinet a draft of the new king's Crown Prince Gustave, the New King of Sweden, proclamation to the Swedish people. In an ante-chamber high officers and officials discussed the probable policy of the new king. One by one the ships in the harbor and the buildings throughout the city displayed the flag at half mast and the people soon crowded the streets near the palace, but all spoke In whispers, bearing wit? ness to the kindliness of him who had departed and to the love they bore him. In the death chamber knelt the heart? broken queen and gathered about her were her children, grandchildren and great-grand? hildren. praying for strength to bear their great affliction.
