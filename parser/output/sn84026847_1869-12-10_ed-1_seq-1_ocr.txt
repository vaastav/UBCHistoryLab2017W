The plaoo for tbe iaw-giver is in Congress ; the place for the brother-in-law giver is in the Ex ecutive chair. "The thief doth fear each bush an officer," and England magnifies each mnrnnir of discontent in Ireland into a j Fenian rising. Already the allied army is feeling the consequences of peuetrating into Paraguay. They are sufF^ring for food. That is a point for Lopez. Treasurer Spinner has been inter viewed, and be pronounces tbe New York drawback frauds the most adroit ever perpetrated, aud says that the J originator, if honest, would make the, best Secretary of the Treasury we ever I had. No disparagement to the present Head of that Department is intended. Old "torch and turpentine" Brown low is in favor of the removal of the entire Radical Judiciary of Tennessee and tbe amendment of the Constitution upon a Democratic basis. The old man in the ordinary course of nature has not long to live, aud bad better make the most of it in deeds fitted to atone for the past. _ The President's message had no word of kindness for the District of Columbia, although it has been customary for twenty years, for tbe aunual message to commend tbe District to the generois consideration of Congress. Tbe omis sion is interpretel to mean that Grant favors tbe proposition for the removal of the Capital to St. Louis. He owns a three hundred acre farm near that city. The fact is reasonably conclusive of bis position on the Capital question _ Hos. W ii.l am McKennan, of Wash ington, Pennsylvania, appointed by the President to the Jadgeship of the Third Ciicuit, holds tbe position of brevet brother-in-law to the Grant family. Hi* son-in-law, William Smith, Esq > we understand, is a distant cousin of Mrs. Grant. The appointee has some legal ability, but this fact, it is fair to presume, bad little to do with the uomination. It was not his lawyer lil.e acquirements but his brotber-in lawyerlike qualifications that did the btiMQCSS. _ Xinlhrr I. ale. Chief Justice Scott of Baltimore, on last Saturday, decidod that Mr. Lin coln's proclamation was "without au thority and void." A very important decision, though it strikes us as coming a few days too late to be productive of either good or baiin. Sumpinnry l,nw?. Four States ? Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio and Minnesota? have refused to elect. temperance tickets or pass sumptuary laws this year. In all of ti.ese State- the people have given a lnrtr** majority against the prohibitory principle, not because they would en courage intemperance, but simply to show that this kind of legal regul.v tionsis unwise and improper. Drunk enness can no more be suppressed by legal enactment imposing penalties, than can the "social evil" bo decreased by statute. Taxation may tend to lessen both, and put a great deal of money in tbe Treasury; but this is the only mode of attacn that is useful to our L -gislatures, or will be authoritod by the people. The Mellon Ufmofrnl. We desire to call tbo atteutiou of our business men to the merits of the Wes ton Democrat as an advertising medium. This paper has for some tiino been under the able and encrgetic management of Messrs. Cozap and Wofkinpks, who are making it the best journal by far tver published in Lewis county. The former is one of tbe keenest political writers i:? the State; tbe latter has charge of the local department, which is always lively, fresh and spicy. This department aloue as ai present con ducted would insure the Democrat an exteusive popularity. ( The Democrat circulates largely iu the ] co uuties of Lewis, Braxton, I pshur. ! Ginner and Calhoun, and reaches many i business men whose trade would be val* I liable to our city. Let our merchants ! and manufacturers send their cards to the Democrat and they will not Only be patronizing an excellent and deserviug journal, but they will be making an in vestment that will remunerate them handsomely iu a business point of view. Address Cozap Woffinden, publish ers of the Democrat, WestoD, Lewis couuty, West Virginia. C'hrialtuas Prrimli. Christmas is at band, and the event oftbatdayis tbe Christmas present. Everybody should take time by the forelock in choosing gifts, aud not leave it till the last day, to the iuconveuienoe of both seller and buyer. The crowded state of the stores then makes it diffi cult to see or to show the wares; the want of time limits choice and discrim ination; prices are higher; these and many other considerations prompt nsto bethink ourselves of the great question, "what shall we givef" The scope of choice is with some too much narrowed. There was once a time wheu what is called an "Annual," printed for the purpose, was a conventional Christmas gift. Peor things they were; got up for show. Which was chietly in the binding. But this has fallen into disuse. Now tbe shelves of our book-stores groan with every variety of literature, and the taste of the giver may exercise itself freely, and adapt itself to the age aud character aud sex of tbe receiver. Nay, the scope of choice is wider still for gifts. Every article of housekeeping, of clothing, whether for use or ornament, is now au admissible gift, as well as objects of taste apd decoration. The old notion that the Christmas gift must be something su peril uons or useless is exploded; nor ueed it be merely ornamental. There is a novel by Bclwer called "What will He do With it I" The title sug gests a good question that ibould rise' in the minds of those who buy presents. What will the receiver do with it!' Will he eat it, wear it, play with it, read it, look at it, show it, preserve it? for some such purpose all gifts should befit; some for one person, some for another. Now is the time to choose. An easy way to make yonr choice is to turn to tho advertising columns of the Register. Abont holiday times especially there peroral will suggest an infinite variety of useful, ornamental, and agreeable object?, which will hardly Icnmo amiss ti auy "well-regulated family." Remember, too, that as a gen eral rule, goods which are not worth advertising are nut worth buyiug and that when a merchant don't invite your attention to his stock, through the newspaper?, you cannot regard him as specially anxious for your custom. Cruelly find Neglect. George A. Pearrk of Maryland, has been appointed United States Judge for the F?irth Circuit, composed of the States of Maryland, Virginia, West Vir ginia and North Carolina. West Vir ginia "loyalty" is iu agony. It has been cruelly ignored, summarily snubbed by the ungrateful Ulysses. Of the many spotless aspirants in this Stnte whose ambitions souls reached ont toward the ermine of the United States beuch, not one has received the faintest symptom of recognition. Not for their wearing are the judicial robes they coveted. In default thereof they cover themselves and their disappoint ment "with curses, as with a garment." It were a difficult and a sorrowful task to number the victims who by this act of the President are consigned to the grave of oblivion. Throughout the State there is a great cry beard, for there is scarcely a county where there is not one slaughtered. The Harri sons are defunct, Maxwell is ousgaspeil, Stanton will not be co mforted because he is not appointed; a host of the | "loyal" elect frem all quarters bewail the killing frost that has nipped the roots of their greatness just when they thought it was a-ripening. But individual grievances shrink to nothing when compared with the dis grace thus put upon "our glorious young State." West Virginia "loyalty" couuts for nothing; her Radical light ousness is as tiltby ragn; Maryland Copperheadism is altogether lovely. IIiram Simpson has taken the bread of I the "loyal" children and given it to be devoured by the hungry rebeldom of Maryland. In vain did West Virginia poll her nine thousand majority for Grant, peacoand plunder. In vain has tb? registrar wielded his axe. In vain were twenty-five thousand men in tho State denied the privilege of voting for Seymour. In vain have proscription and perse cution, corruption, perjury and villainy kept West Virginia in the front ranks of Republicanism. West"Virginla, that never cast any but a "loyal" vote, is left without a crumb from the Execu tive table, and Maryland, that never will cast any but a Democratic vote, basks in the 6uiiles of Ulyssks aud i fares sumptuously from his baud. Let tho "loyal" heart have sympathy, for it I is sad. _____ __ THE

An artiole ap pears in the Dnbnqne Times, written by a gentleman at Fort Dodge, Iowa, which claims to throw light on tho Car diff giant. It says about the sixth of Jnne, two men registered their names at the St. Charles Hotel, at Fort Dodge, as Georgo Hall, Binghampton, New York, and II. E. Martin, Boston. For several weeks after their move ments were of a suspicious character, and they finally purchased an acre of gypsuui land from John McDermott, paying one hundred dollars for it, built a shanty on the ground, pnd employed men to open the gypsum quarry, for the purpose, as they said, to send handsome pieces to New York. They got out a large stone and dressed it to eleven fe<?t three inches in length and three feet i two inches in width, and then loaded it I 011 a railrobd car. The theory is that Hall and Martin took the stone to ! Chicago, where it was worked into a ! st.itue, and taken thence to Binghamp ton and thence to Ne well's farm. The correspondent expresses the opin ion that Colonel Wood, formerly of the Chicago Museum, is concerned in the giant, as he happened around just when they were digging up the giant. It is said the man who carved the giant is now in Chicago, bnt prefers to keep quiet. VIRGINIA. The Political MitwnlUa. | New \ork. December 0. ? A Richmond dispatch to the Herald says : The Presi dent's recommendation to Congress for the early adtuisnion of Virginia and the prospect of it being speedily carried out cause a general feeling of rejoicing, the exceptions being a few factions of Radicals whom , the Republican party loft to run the last Convention and a few soreheaded old Democrats, who ex hibit cheap plnck by swearing that they would rather be under Cauby than Walker. The great mass of the Repub licans and Conservatives are rejoiced at the prospect of an early admission. The talk about the Legislature uuder { taking to npset the provisions of the new Constitution or reader them ! inoperative ia unfounded. The only parties interested in keeping the State out are non-residents who have been appointed to civil office by tho military. All Northern people who have come here a? farmers or business men are rejoiced over the approaching admission, no matter which side they are on politics, and all the oflice-hold ers are opposed to it. m " * Doo'l Whip a Frightened florae. 1 Never whip ynnr horse for becoming frightened at any object by tbe road side: for it. he sees a stump, a log, or a j heap of tan bark in tho road, and while j he is eyeing it carefully, and about te j pass it, you strike him with the whip, j it is the log, or the stump, or the tan : bark that is hurting him, iu his way of | reasoning, and the next time lie w'ifl act ! more frightened.

Mr. Sumner offered a resolution di recting the committee on the District of Columbia to consider the expediency of repealing the charter of the Medical Society of the District, and of takiBg such other legislation as may be neces sary to secure for the medical practi tioners in the District eqnal rights and opportunities, without distinctioa of color. Mr. Trumbull reported a bill amenda tory to an act relating to the appelate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Senate, after a brief Executive session, adjouraed till Moaday. 

HOUSE. Mr. Brooks presented a petition of the leather anil hide importing trade of New York, asking the repeal of the duty on bides and stating that the business unfavorably effected exceeds one hun dred millions in leather and two hun dred millions a year in boots hnd shoes, and that the export trade in boots and shoes is ruined. Mr. Shanks introduced a bill to per fect the reconstruction of Georgia. Referred to the Reconstruction com mittee. Mr. Stevenson introduced a bill to place on the free list the following arti cles: Tea, coffee, molasses and syrup, melada or cane juice, rice, salt, lumber, hides and stains, printing paper, iron in pigs. Referred to the committee on Ways and Means. Mr. Fox asked leave to offer a resolu tion for the creation of a special com mittee of five members to investigate the causes that led to the unusual^ or extraordinary fluctuation iu the New York gold market from the 21st to the 25th of September last, and especially to iaquire if the President, Secretary of the Treasury, or any other officer of the Government was in any manner inter ested in causing such fluctuations, with power to send for persons and papers. Mr. Scofield and others objected and the reselution was not received. Mr. Churchill introduced a bill divi ding the northern judicial district of New York into two districts, to be called the Middle aud Western districts. Mr. Wilson, of Ohio, introduced a resolution instructing the committee on Invalid Pensions to inquire into the propriety of amending the pensiou law by making it the duty of pension agents to prepare vouchers and transmit them to the postoffice address of the pen sioner. Adopted. Mr. Van Trump presented joint reso lutions of the Ohio Legislature rejecting the proposed Fifteenth Constitutional Amendment. Referred to the Judiciary committee.

Referred to the committee on Public Lands. Mr. Loughridge introduced a bill to provide for a continued supply of arti ficial limbs to soldiers, aud to exteud the time for filing claims for additional bounty. Referred to tho committee on I u valid Pensions. The House went into committee of tho Whole, Mr. Dawes in tin chair, and resumed tho consideration of the Census bill. The discussion was participated in by many members, as to the most economical way of taking the census, Mr. Butler, of Massachusetts, contend ing that the work could be best and most appropriately performed by the officers of internal revenue. Mr. Butler, of Massachusetts, wishing to test the sense of the House on whether tho present machinery of the Government should be used for taking the census or whether a new set of officers should be created, moved to i amend the fourth section by making it read "that it shall be the duty of the Assessor of Internal Revenue in each District to cause all the inhabitants to be enumerated." Mr. Judd argued on the great import ance of statistical information to be ob tained by the census, taken not only by tho Legislative Department of the country, but for national creditors abroad, and expressed the sentiment that no ideas of economy should bo per mitted to intervene as an obstacle to a perfect and oompleto census. Mr. Garfield also replied to the argu ment in favor of employing internal revenue officers to take the census, taking the ground that the tax-gatherer was au officer odious to the people, who should be thoroughly conviuced that the census had no connection whatever with taxation. Mr. Allison, member ef the Census committee, also argued against tho amendmert offered by Mr. Butler. Mr. Butler closed the debate by an argument in support of his amendment. The question was taken on Mr. Butler's amendment and it was rejected; ayes 22, nany not counted. On motion of Mr. Wood and after considerable discussion the fifth section was amonded by requiring each district superintendent to be a resident of the district. After agreeing to the seventh section the committee rose. Mr. Lawrence introduced a bill to prevent aod punisn election frauds, and prescribe the time for the holding of elections for members of Congress. Re ferred to the committee on Elections. Mr. Davies introduced a bill to impose a tax on all fictitious and gambling sales of gold. Referred to the Judiciary committee. The House at 4:15 adjourned until to morrow. NEW
