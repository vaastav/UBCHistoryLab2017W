-4IBIG GUNS1* WHO HAVE COME AND GONE. ( 1 f Washington, D. C., Dec. 16. ? HiSr" tory Is b?lng-made tlieso days at a rapid pace. The weefc? has been re plete with startling incident, with every scene appealing strongly to contemporaneous human interest ? as the playbills would describe the situation. * President Ropsevelt has surprised everybody by his special message to Congress telling of the discovery of new evidence in the Brownsville ease giving out clews that may lead to an unravelling of * the tangled skein in which the truth about the famous shooting-up of the Texas town has been enmeshed. The President, with characteristic vigor and directness ^of statement, points ? way by which* the innocent soldiers mayN be reinstated and the guilty ones puni ailed. Senator Fo raker is having hi# Vda,y In'cduTt," likewise, and the tftfesMng process is being carried out with such thoroughness on both sides that the lawmen may venture the . hope -thftt somewhere between ttyj'tj^vo extremes the exact story may'^om'o out and full justice ra^y be done to all concerned. The belief is common tliat the President is^ anxious to give the , soldiers a;* 4 "square cteal," phd nt>w that appar ent guilt has been placed with more or less deflniteness, it will be easier to establish the innocence of those who were in no position to have knowledge of the events of the troub lous night and morning of August 13 and 14, 1906. It looks as if we are approaching the beginning of the end of this historic episodq. \ t. r.'." mti I ' V-. ? Tli ^ th? North' Clufolind. Soetety in New York 1b being discussed upon all sides, and everywhere praise ifc heard of its soundness and statesmanlike tone. It breathed a wholesomfe spirit of na tional unity, and bespoke "justice for the black man and fair play for both races in' the Southland. The well poised references to th$ Negro prob lem, the contentibn for equality of opportunity, for - advancement and for protection #under the law, the ar rangement of the suffrage so as to place the burden of \ responsibiliy upon tfy^ shoulders of electors who have a Btake in ?? the community, treating white and black intelligence and white and black ignorance exact ly alike, and so adjusting economic advantages that the South and North could each work out their common destiny as integral factors in the great American nation in peace and harmony, could not .be gainsaid. They were timely and to the point ? no equivocation, no dodging and no recantation, of the pledges openly made throughout the rccent cam paign. Mr. Taft makes it plain that he intends to be President of the whole people, and the Negro, in agreement with the thinking citizens of the republic, are confident that he will live up to the highest expecta- j tions in his dealings on both the economic and the- ethical issues which he will 4>e compelled to face in the next four ? or eight? years. Even these colored men who bitterly opposed Mr. Taft's nomination an'd some who carried oh their fight to the finish, are obliged to go far afield to pick anything 'akin to a flaw in ihis, his first significant declaration Of policy on the race question since his election. His utterances were particularly happy and those who have believed in hdm thoroughly from the start are delighted and his opponents are at least agreeably dis appointed. While the latter are re luctantly granting him a suspension of judgment, the former are more than ever determined to hold up his hands and give him that cordial measure of support that will spell success to his broad-gauged policies and make for our betterment as American citizens. Far-seeing col ored men are realizing, as Mr. Taft ? ia realizing that the republic is on the eve of a new order of things, so cial, intellectual, moral and^ indus trial, and it behooves all o'f us to prepare well for the ordeal before us. President Roosevelt has given a formal order to the Secretary of War directing that as soon aa vacancies oc cur in the position of bandmaster in the colored regiments in the United Army, competent colored m us -cans shall be appointed. In order that no injustice may b done by the dis placement of any white musician now in charge of colored bands, it is di rected that these men be transferred to * white regiments wherever vacan cies are made in thx> natural course of events, thus .nfitktng art opening for-tho c6Jofed bajadmfiteter. We . ' -v V;v,' \ * . / ? ?? y ^ ? ' V < V {'? * ?V I have now one full-f)edged colored bandmaster ? Elbert Williams, for merly leader of the band at Tuskegee Institute ? now stationed with.1 the 25th Infantry in the Philippines. Col ored men have acted as chief musi cian in all o# the colored regiments, in the temporary absence of ? the white chief, and have in every case, glyen satisfaction. It is regarded as only fair that colored musicians, well-versed in their calling, be given a change to prove their metal . and reap and benefit accruing from their I high-rgrade equipment.' In this connection it may be stated that Valentine Buckries, (white), lat? chief musician of the 26th' In fantry, likewise white, has been re tired by hJis own .request, and Chief Musician W. O. /Thompson, for many years attached to th>e 24th Infantry, has been* sent to the Philippines to take his place. The vacancy thus occurring in the 24th regiment, now at Madison Barracks, New York, will shortly be filled by a colored chief, in keeping with the order of the President. Among those mentioned for the position is Alexander Sewall, formerly of the United States Navy, conductor of a band in this city, who is highly recommended by musi cians of the highest standing. The entire credit for the inauguration of this generous policy on the part of the Administration ? beginning dur ing the incumbency of Judge Taft as Secretary of War. belongs to Rmmett J. ScoTt, the enterprising and re sourceful secretary to Dr. Booker ' T. Washington. In a short time we hap? to be ablest/) teH ftue -story in' full. By direction of the War Depart ment, Gen. Leonard Wood, command ing the Department of the J2ast, at New York, has ordered that the one company of the 24th1 Infantry at Madison Barracks, N. Y., be sent to New Y6rk City to participate in the great parade and exercises to be held there on the first of January, under the auspices of the Lincoln Emanci pation Association of Brooklyn. The movement for tbiis emancipation cel ebration grew out of the activity of George E. Wibecan, of the Post-Office Department and a political leader of much prominence in Kings county. The orator of the day will be Hon. William Tecumseh Vernon, Register of the United States Treasury. Later in the season, Dr. Vernon will speak* in Cleveland, celebrating the 100th anniversary -of the birth of Abraham I>incoln. President W. S. Scarborough, of Wilberforce University continues to have honors th(rust upon him. In the East he was the recipient of marked attention at the hands of educators of the first rank, and patrons of edu cation, such as Prof. Nicholas Mur ray Butler, president* of Columbia - college, Hon. Seth Low and Mr. Rob ert C. Ogden, George Foster Pea-' body? William Jay Schjeffelin and William G. Willcox, all of whom evinced deep interest in the welfare of Wilberforce and from which sub stantial returns may be expected in the near future. They were im pressed1 with' Dr. Scarboroughfs rare scholarship atid versatility of attain ments, and agreed that he is th.e right frtan in the right place. He is now 'at the school, but is to go to the University of Toronto (Canada) shortly, by special invitation to at tend a meeting of the American Phil ological Association, before which august body he will read a paper on "Some disputed Passages in Cicer's I/etter"? a subject on whrich he is recognized as an authority. Dr. Scarborough is seeing to it that the name of Wilberforce University is creditably sustaind among the most distinguished thought-centers of the nation. He is expected in Washing ton by-and-by, and will be heard be fore Bethel Literary and Historical Association. The annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Anna T. Jeannes 'nillion-doll^r fund in aid of the col ored schools of the rural districts of thie Soil8$, attracted national atten tion. Many notable personages were present, including o President-elect William Howard Taft, who presided | over the deliberations, Andrew Car negie, the "Ironmaster," Walter H.

We have a number of orphan chil dren in the Home loking forward to Christmas. When you were chil dren you know how very, very anx ious you were . for the time when "Santa Claus" would make his ap pearance. I want you to help be our. "Santa Claus." These little ones have begun .to^ talk of Christmas and wonder if "Santa Claus" is too poor to remem ber them this year. You know Christmas is a. bi^Uiday. Why not give some of .your gifts unto these little ones? Whatsoever you do for the least of these, you do for 'Him. Let us think of these Orphans ac cording to our means, that we may add a ray of sunshine to their little hearts. Let us share with them some of our happiness with which we are blessed in order that thev may be comforted. , We truly hope by the twenty-fifth of December, we will have been the recipients of any thing that you de sire to send. This deed of kindness wiy cheer some a>ching hearts, bring sunshine and gladness antl ..cause the shadow of gloom that is now over them to depart. Trusting you will give us Jraftir assistance. ?

ALEXANDER. * ? . REPORT. Mt. Carbon, Dec. 14. ? It becomes 1 my dirty as Superintendent of Mis- | .Sunday School convention, to speak | a few words through. the columns I of this paper concerning the work I which we have been trying to foster. I Those of us who were so fortunate I as to attend our annual sekeion in I Charleston last May have not forgot- I ten the pleasing results witnessed in I going; over the reports of our mis- 1 sionary department. That body of earnest laborers look I out upon the fields of this rapid de- !' velopiftg state of -ours and advised! that our field of missionary opera- I tion be broadened, by* introducing! our work in the Baltimore and Ohio I and the Norfolk and Western dis- 1 tricts and that the work be continued | in ? th? Chesapeake and Ohio section as heretofore. The Superintendent of Missions] TVftg'^utfiorieed to take the general | oversight of this operation. In keeping with said instruction, | after leaving Charleston, my atten- 1 tion was called to the needy condi- 1 tion in several places. Mrs. Mary S. Reid, one of the Board members, was dispatched to Gauly River and ^she succeeded in sqtting apart a Sunday J School, which! now is going on sue- I. cessfully. T&e Executive Board in its June! meeting at Montgomery approved of the appointment of Rev. Geo. J. Jett, I i of Clarksburg, to work in the bounds I of the Mt. Zion Association.. He | was given the proper credentials and | such instructions necessary to enable him to credibly represent, our Sun day School work in that section. I His reports show that he has been.1 laboring faithfully but his work has been largely seed sowing from which we are hoping to reap a bountiful! harvest. ! The Virginian Railroad, which is I Inow being operated between Deep- 1 water and Princeton, has opened up! to us a new field of missionary r operation which has received much attention by your Sunday school missionary. All of t^e new settle- I ments have been visited,* two Sun day Schools have been organized, lit- 1 erattire has been distributed in the | homes and prayer meetings have been held in the mining and railroad camps. This route leads us into I the wide north division of the Nor folk and Western and this kind or work has been given a hearing in this territory also. While I was on the . Guyandotte I Valley? Bro. Wm. Smith rendered I me much service in getting over the field. All the settlements inhabited by our people were visited and such religions service rendered as was I needed. The Sunday Schiool .which | I organized ot Ethel is still going on with a promising outlook. It can be seen from the several re- 1 ports passed by our annual assem blies that it is expected that I meet all the associations, conventions and unions in the state. This greatly in ? creases my mileage, still I have en | deavored to carry out such! recom mendation. In so doing I was cor- 1 di&lly received and I. assisted where ev&f'-t could to foster their interests.! ;K/:,vVl-V - On ill#* 9A*U W r,!*., p^,^e 24ta -bf OTuty **ntouta$kiiig ali.$e ;*1j l ?. -rr~'-'0 ??- W iJMUyW^ iipwi Officers and .teachers, to set >p?rt the second Sunday in August slonary To severahftf ttoe actiooja vespot liberally, f^fifardiew df th?jt depression' with wtiteh ? the has been visited.

At a mess . meeting of Colored- citi zens hel<| ija the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church today ? to protest against the passage Gf a separate car law, strong resolutions were adopted.

W, Winston and others, 'all ?? whom be lieved that while separation is pre ferable in church, school and home, that on public carriers it would be a violation of thei** civil rights and ought to be resisted in e,very possible way. The resolutions were unani mously adopted and read as follows: Whereas, the Wheeling Intelligen cer, the leading Republican organ in this State, in its issue of Decem ber 2nd inst came ^ut.in an editorial asserting that on account of the Ne gro it is "absolutely unsafe for a white woman unattended to travel on a railroad train" and calling uiJoYi the Republicans to pass a Jim Crow law; and Whereas, The same editorial also asserts that "a large majority of the more thoirghtful colored men who have traveled in the Southern coun ties will favor such legislation"; ahd Whereas, Both this question and the question of disfranchisment were made the leading issues in the re cent campaign by the Democratic party and were overwhelmingly de feated by the people at the polls, and Wh^Teas, The Republican party not only declared in its platform tjiat the Negro "bad earned the re spect of the State and the Nation but prpmised to "guarantee to the color fed citizens of our State a continuance of full and free enjoyment of citizen ship ""under the Constitution" there fore be it Resolved (first) That we, the col-j ored citizens of Wie city of -Hunting tofi in mass meeting assembled, sol emnly protest against the passage of a law jjs an abridgment of our civil rights as citizens of the United States. Resolved (second) That we de nounce the Intelligencer's editorial as unmanly, unwarranted and un truthful. ' Resolved (Third) That while we admit that there is an elemetfl of loud, ill-mannered, unclean Negroes among us which we eondemn, we nevertheless challenge the Intelligen cer to point to a case on record where a white woman has been molested by them as charged. ' Resolved (fourth) That we regard a Jim Crow car as class legislation and therefore, vicious and we call upon our county members to the leg islature not to be milled as to the Negro's position, nor as honorable Republicans whom we loyally sup parted. to be guilty of such an act of pejrfldy. Resolved (fifth) That copies of these resolutions be sent to the In telligencer, the city Herald, onr own State ; papers, and to eaeh^of our representatives In the legtt&ttire. Ak.W, .* . .

That 'was one of the closing para graphs of an extern poratieous speech made in th^ Senate this afternoon T>y - Mr. Foraker, of Ohio, apropos of the Brownsville shooting in August, 1906. " ' f The Senator did not expect to make a speech at this time, but he was moved to making scfme observa- , tions which' he regarded as pertinent by the transmission by the President of a special message pealing" with the riotous proceeding in the Texas town; and tending to sHow that the Administration had got on the track of the Negro soldiers who were im plicated in the affray. . He had hastily analyzed the affi davits o# the detectives who were specially employed in ferreting out evidence to establish the act that Some of this members of the colored battalion th^t was dismissed without honor from the army were guilty. He had Just read a number of let ters from Boyd . Conyers, one of the ex-sgldiers, upon wbo&e alleged ad missions the conclusions of the Gov ernment sleuthfc v^had been based; 1 ' * 1 i * to* partment, . ? rrvu i-> . ? ? * ? ........ x 'iiv) orownsvnie case was unex pectedly projected into the Senate proceedings by the President's mes sage, which was accompanied) by a report from the Secretary of War, containing the affidavits and state- j ments of the men who had been em- j ployed to collect evidence sustaining the claim that the* Negroes were guilty of the shooting. Wants Each Soldier Heard. - The Brownsville case proper be comes the regular order of the Sen ate on Wednesday of thds "dreek, and ih anticipation of the discussion j which will then arise, Senator For- 1 aker had prepared an amendment to the bill to be introduced . at the last session, providing for Jthe reinstate ment of the discharged soldiers and the restoration of the civil right of which they had been deprived on the theory that they are innocent. This amendment provides for the creation of a commission consisting < of Lieutenant General A. R. Chaffee, j Lieutenant General John C. Bates, Major General George Davis, MTa- ! jor ^General Jesse M. Lee and Briga dier General A. S. Daggett. All re tired, to hear and determine all charges tending to identfy the non commissioned. offloers arid men of the Negro battalion who riiay have par ticipated in th affray or withheld knowledge concerning . it. This commission, it Is proposed, shall examine into any charges that rrjay be preferred against an accused soldier, and if he is not found guilty, he shall be reinstated. J It will be observed that this would ; put it up to the Administration to pick out the men who, it alleges, took part in the shooting. In other words, the Senator adroitly suggests that some one acting for the Presi dent become the prosecutor of the Negi*o troops. ? It may have been a mere coinci dence that he was explaining h(is amendment, when tne President's message was delivered, or vice versa. At any rate the two things innocent ly conspired to produce a sudden and unexpected climax. ;The Ohio Senator always com mands the attention and interest of his colleagues when he arises to speak, especially on Brownsville, and as soon as he took the floor today there was an immediate inpouring of Senators from the committee and cloak rooms, and they sat In rapt attention until he concluded. ' Indictment Against Detectives.
