The bourbons of France, it was said, never learned anything and never for got anything. The bourbon protection ,ista of the United States difier some- What from their French brethren. They SV never learn anything but they forget everything that fhey ever have learned in the fool's school of experience. They gave full vent to their greed in the tarifl act of 1883. Ignoring the counsels of the moderates they cut as deep as greed could dictate and they passed a tariff law in which every selfish interest that wanted a monopoly of the home market had its will, What was the result? The defeat of the party on the tariff isBuein 1884. In 1888 the tariff benefi ciaries literally bought the election. They raised the largest campaign fund that was ever spent in politics. They bought votes as drovers buy sheep. Thtoy succeeded in defeating Cleveland, %.wh'o bad precipitated the tariff discus sion and who lost the soldier yotes be cause cf his pension yetoes. What was the result? VThe McKinley bill of 1890 and that /^.dictated by the greed of those who KM gotten tile taste of American blood thirsted for it as the wolf's mouth Irs. "That tariff act caused a politi d'ujiop. It swept even Mr.Mc -eimgiew.-' -it -^-us—the es of scores of congressmen of the |ng cattle variety. It re-elected Mr. Wand in 1892. The silver legislation and other causes IjKoduced the panic of 1893, That gave tn& protectionists an opportunity to i^jappeal to popular discontent, and Mc 9$ Kinley was elected in 1896 and Dingley law was passed. The campaign of 1900 was not fought on the tariff issue. Mr. Bryan and the Chicago plat form relegated the tarifl issue to the rear and staked their all on the free sil ver issue. That issue has been decided irrevocably. It will never plague us again The tariff question now comes to the fore. And. strange to note, the protectionist bourbons are paving the way for a republican defeat in 1904, They are threatening to stifle all revision '*,.• or reduction of the tariff. They snuff out reciprocity, and are demanding that 4h the trusts have their tariffs to help them hold the home trade by the throat while -they sell to foreigners at' 10,15 and 20 'per cent cheaper than they sell to their /gf! neighbors and fallow citizens. X* W-1 41 W* 1 Mark the prediction: The campaign of 1904 will be on the tariff issue and 4,he republican party, controlled by the trusts and tariff benefi ciaries, will be defeated. There has been considerable specula tion as to why the Buffalo physicians who attended the late President McKin ley failed to avail themselves of the op portunity to Send their bills to Senator U&nna and receive their pay without waiting for their money. The general opinion is that the doctors think they will be more liberally recompensed if tbey wait until congress votes them a lump sum of $100,000 or so, which they can diyide among themselves instead of letting shrewd Mark Hanna pass upon their claims. It is likely, too, that view of the criticisms passed upon their treatment, and its results, the medical men feel a delicacy in naming the amount desired for their services. Con gress is never penurious in rewarding pooh creditors, and the physicians are no doubt wise in waitiDg for their pay. Perhaps they bear in mind that $100,000 was appropriated to pay the doctors who attended President Garfield in his last illnfess.—Post. The president's message certainly 'Stacks a great deal of being a witty affair if it is true that "Brevity is the soul of Wik" Representative Grosvenor says, -Con gress will no more amend' the tariff th: the ten commandments." THE 

LEON PilftgiSI THE MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's message to Con gress may be commended even by those who differ politically with the President, there being a basis for criticism rather in what is left unsaid than in what the President has allowed himself to outline definitely as constituting his recom mendations of policy. The general tone of the message is dignified, patriotic and conservative. In most instances it is characteristic of Mr. Booseyelt and, therefore, to this extent fulfills popular expectation. Where the message fails in such respects it is easy to perceive the effect of influ ences which, in all likelihood, the Pres ident was unable to resist as a Republi can and to which he yielded bis obedi ence to the point of refraining from thfe fullest and freest expression of his in dividual views. There must necessarily be some disap pointment that Mr. Roosevelt, whose personal convictions are so well known to the American people, has been con tent with so mild a recommendation concerning the trusts. His advocacy of publicity of trust affairs is good as far as it goes, and sound-thinking persons will agree with him that "the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that ex treme care must be taken not to inter fere with it in a spirit of rashness or ig norance." But the President might well have been more assertiye in sug gesting measures with regard to a sys tem which, not properly regulated, works much of evil to the people. There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people," the President's message itself declares, 'that the great corporations known as trusts are uncertain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the genera welfare." Yet the message seems to im ply a keener solicitude for the interests of these great corporatiohstfian for the people's good. The machine pressure on Mr. Roosevelt is apparent here. Espeeially was the President negligent in failing to treat frankly and fully of the very root of all that is evil in the trust system, the tanfi protection of the trusts, the tax paid by the people, which has created monopoly and which alone makes possible the maintenance of monopoly at the people's continued cost.

They cannot regard as "in fant industries," iucapable of existing without subsidy, the great American manufacturing corporations which are now underselling all competitors in for eign markets. They see plainly that there is absolutely no excuse for the maintenance of an oppressive tariff for the "protection" of these giant corpora tions. The only effect of such a tax on the people is to increase corporation profits in this country and to perfect the monopoly eDjoyed by such corporations owing to the fact that competition is made impossible. The President's rec ommendation of the policy of reciproc ity fails utterly to satisfy the American Deople on an issue so important. And even this recommendation is so hedged about with warnings not to unduly dis turb the present tariff as to lose what little strength it might otherwise have In the matter of our colonial posses sions the President's message leaves the situation unchanged and as vague aB ever. We do not know whether Mr. Roosevelt contemplates the ultimate dignity of statehood for Hawaii, Porto Rico and the Philippines. We do not know whether he would recommend in stead the holding of these islands as dependencies, simply, with no prospect of their peoples arriving at American citizenship. He declares that "our aim is high," but he does not specify in defi nite termB what that aim is. There is absolutely no new light on the Repub lican policy with regard to our colonies. As to the Philippines, the President's greatest fear, repeatedly expressed, is that we may unwittingly give them la greater degree of self-government than is good for them. The message rightfully makes a forci ble recommendation fdf^TCgfelation to suppress anarchy. This recommendation follows Mr. Roosevelt's touching review of the assassination of the late Presiden McKinley by the anarchist Czolgosz.* The urgency for the prompt and rigor ous crushing of anarchy as a malign and incongruous element in American life is strongly stated and will meet with in stant popular approval. So, also, as maintaining the traditional American attitude, will the President's .reiteration of the Monroe Doctrine as the cardinal feature of the American foreign policy be approved by the American people. The unusual prominence given in ari and navy affairs in the message is to President Roosevelt's deep and in telligent interest in the two branches ot the American militant service. As As sistant Secretary of the Navy he be came potently familiar with our condi tionB of sea power and manfully shared in preparing the American Navy for its splendid achievements during the war with Spain. As a Colonel of volunteers he served in the American Army through out that same war and thus completed his fitness for such a discussion of army and navy needs as is now found in his message. The recommendations made in this field aie entitled to peculiar con sideration as coming from an American President who speaks with more than the conventional knowledge of the. American Army and Navy. President Roosevelt's first annual message, submitted to the Fifty-seventh Congress yesterday, is now before the American people. It is commended to tbeir earnest attention. As a political utterance it is a carefully considered expression of Republican policy. Its tone indicates that Mr. Roosevelt has already come under the restraining -i fluence of the party leaders and largely surrendering himself to thei views.—Republic.
