provisional governor until he could be replaced oy Air Mngoon the late minis ter to Panama and governor of the canal lone on the Isthmus troops were sent to support them and to relieve the navy the expedition being handled with most satisfactory speed and efficiency The Insurgent chiefs immediately agreed that their troops should lay down their arms and disband and the agreement was car ried out The provisional government has left the personnel of the old for Cubas career as a nation would again have to intervene and to see that the government vvnc managed In such orderly fashion as to secure

entertained and facilitated In their work e Incidentally to the meeting of the con ference the secretnry of state visited the city of Hlo de Janeiro and was cordially received by the conference of which he was made an honorary president The announcement of his Intention to make this visit was followed by the most cour teous and urgent Invitations from near ly all the countries of South America to visit them as the guest of their govern ments It was deemed that by the ac ceptance of these Invitations we might appropriately express the real respect and friendship In which we hold our sis ter republics of the southern continent and the secretary accordingly visited Brazil Uruguay Argentina Chill Peru lanama nnd Colombia He refrained from visiting Paraguay Bolivia and Ecuador only because the distance to their capitals from the seaboard made It impracticable with the time at his die nasal He carried with him a message of peace and friendship and of strong the greatest empire and we deem the ob servance of that respect the chief guar anty of the weak against the oppression of the strong We neither claim nor de sire any rights or privileges or powers that we do not freely concede to every American republic Vc wish to lncreae our pruspemv to sxtend our triili to grow in wealth In wisdom and In spirit but our conception of the true way to ac complish this Is not to pull down

and to the dinger that the process cif compuNory collection might reult In the occupation of territory tend ing to become permanent I then said Our own government hus always re fused to enforce such contractual obliga tion on behalf of Its cltlrens by an ap peal to aim It Is much to be vvlsht that all foreign governments would take the same vie w This subject was one of the topics of consideration at the conference at Hlo and a resolution was adopted by that conference recommending to the respec tive governments represented to consid er the advisability of nsklng the second

pollcv of the Inlted States not to uso Its armed forces far the collection of ordinary con tract debts due to Its citizens by other governments We have not considered the ue of force for such n purpose con sistent with that respect for the Inde pendent sovereignty of other members of the famll of nations which Is the most Important principle of International law and the chief protection of weak nntlons against the oppression of the strong It seems to us that the practice Is Injurious In Its general effect upon the relations of nation und upon the welfare of weak and dlordered states whoe development ought to be encouraged In the Interests of civilization that It offers frequent temp tation to bullying and oppression and to unnecessary ami unjustinnuie wnrrare We regret that other

doubtless true that tho nonpayment of public debts may be aocompnnled by such circumstances of fraud and wrongdoing or violation of treaties as to Justify the use of force This government would be glad to see an International consideration of the subject which shnll discriminate between such cases nnd the simple nonperforvuce of a contract with a private persoriTTind a resolution In favor of

Its satisfaction at the happy results of their mediation for the celebration of peace between the repub lics of Guatemala Honduras and Sal vador This nffords an excellent example of one way In which the Influence of the United 8tates can properly be exercised for the benefit of the peoples of the west ern hemisphere that Is by action taken In concert with other American republics and therefore
