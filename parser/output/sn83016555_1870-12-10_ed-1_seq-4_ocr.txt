A secret society of young women exists in Memphis. Each member is bound not to marry a man who can not give her a dip-, jnond ring. Nevada heads the list of States in the amount of expenditure for school expenses per capita. Massachusetts stands next, and California is third. James D. Kennedy, a relative of Lieu tenant Governor Dunn, of Louisiana, has been appointed to an assistant doorkeeper's position at the Capitol. « A tavern-keeper in Austria had his ser vant girl arrested for guzzling twenty-three bottles of^his beer in one evening. Her ex cuse was, that she had been very hungry. ..The thermometer yesterday morning, at seven o'clock, was 48° at New Orleans, 33 at Cincinnati, 27° at Nashville, 37 J at Au gusta, 42° at Lake City, 39° at Mobile, St 3 at Montgomery. The boys in the academy at Peacbam, Vermont,"'confess that they tore down the fence around the soldiers' monument be cause it was built across their base ball ground without authority. C. W. Noyes' Crescent City Circus and Van Amburgh & Co.'s menagerie com bined, arejo be at Alexandria on Monday and Tuesday next. Woods, Cook, and Millie Tournoir are with the circus. Hon. Peter Harper, Representative elect to the Legislature from the parish of St. Charles, is in our city. He carried his par ish by a large majority, and will prove a most useful member of the next House. We regret to learn that Joshua Coleman, lately elected to the Legislature from Tensas parish, died a few days ago, from the effects of a wound which he received in handlings cotton-gin, and which ended in lock-jaw. C. C. Washburn, Representative in Con gress from Wisconsin, has Received a letter from his brother, the Representative of the United States in Paris, that thj people of the French metropolis have provisions enough to hold out until the first of Jan uary. A blind newsboy at Cincinnati, named John Goller, has abandoned his stand and entered the lecture field. In his maiden effort he endeavored to show his hearers how to preserve the purity of the ballot box. At a listening, while the minister was making his certificate, he inquired the day of the month, and happened to say, '"Let me 6ee, this is the thirtieth." "The thirtieth," exclaimed the indignant mother, "indeed, hut it's only the thir teenth." Sixteen rosy-cheeked maidens of Berlin, employed in the chocolate manufactory, re. eently clubbed together and purchased one fourth <jf a ticket in the Prussian State Lot tery. It netted them, at the next drawing, one hundred thousand thalers. By direction of the President, Lieutenant Colonel J. W. Ijlavidson, Tenth cavalry, is. at his ov#n request, relieved from duty as professor of military tactics at the Kansas State Agricultural College, and ordered to join his regiment. The order takes effect from the first of January, 1871. Last evening we had a most welcome call from our friend Hon. J. S. Matthews, who has been re-elected to the Legislature from the parish of Tensas. Mr. Matthews, although young in years, is an experienced and efficient legislator, and always wields much influence with liis brother members. Members of Congress from the South con tinue to receive, by every mail, numerous applications to Congress for the removal of political disabilities. Over fifty names were read Tuesday. The Reconstruction Com mittee of the House propose to decide the question of a general amnesty at an early date. The measure is certainly stronger in both hou«es than it was last session, but whether it can command the required two thirds vote is by no means so < ertain. This evening a grand vocal and instru mental concert will be given at Mechanic's Institute, under the direction of Professor A. P. Williams, assisted by a number 0 £ lady and gentlemen amateurs. Among other attractions at this concert, Mr. Basile J. Bares, so well known as a pianist of eminent talent, will perform among other morccaus his brilliant fantasia on the popular theme ".Shoo Fly." The splendid Chickering piano «sed on this occasion is furnished by Black mar's Temple of Music. We have to announce the sad intelligence of the death of Captain F. W. Matthews f brother of the lion. L. S. 31 at thews, Repre sentative from Tensas parish. Captain Matthews was a native of New Jersey, from which Statd he moved to Illinois in 1856, where he resided until the outbreak of the latq war, when he enlisted in the federal army and served for three years, during which time he was promoted to a captaincy, and served with great honor and credit. He received two severe wounds. For the past eighteen months he has resided at St Joseph, Louisiana, and has been en gage* l in merchandising with his brother. While living in the swamp he contracted that terrible disease, consumption, from which he died. He was a true Republican, an excellent citizen and most worthy yonng man. AN 

UNPROFITABLE REMEDY. A good tiling has at last found an utter ance in the New York Sun. There is no earthly use for a third party at present. The people .of the United States can find, in the platforms of one or the other of the two great parties that now divide the votors of this country, all that they want In fact the necessity is not so great for platforms as it is for men; and if the peo ple will pay more attention to the material they select there will be infinitely less cause for complaint about the measures that will result. Platforms are mere shadows, unless they are committed to wise, discreet and honest agents. Proba ^ we have been injured in this respect doing our work out of the regular order of mechanical undertaking. More attention has been paid to the superstructure of politics than to the foundation. We have attended to the principle without taking proper account? of the man. Honor and capacity are of greater necessity than rhetoric and de clamation; and if politics has de generated, ns the advocates of a third party declare, until the present organiza tions can no longer be relied on, this has been the fault of the people that they for get to select capable and righteous rulers to enforce their just and liberal princi ples. What use would it be to make an honest principle and intrust it to a thief to carry out. Why denoiiuCe monopolies and then elect a monopolist to represent the sentiment? Or what is worse, why dec hum against injustice and bad govern ment when our public servants are selected from those who are purchasable ? Let us lake a view of the field as it pre sents itself. Tnere are already two parties contesting for political supremacy in the United States. They divide between them five or six millions of voters. If the Re publican party were perfectly honest, and of admitted capacity, does any man be lieve that honest and capable Republicans would legislate in any other way than for the greatest good to the greatest number? This is the tenor of the Republican platform at present, and this is what good men would strive for under any and all circumstances. If the Democratic party was recommended by any 6ueli high qualities as those we have mentioned above, does any voter be lieve that its members would support profligate or unjust legislation? And yet the platforms of both of the existing par ties pledge all and Singular their members to a just, honest and economical adminis tration of the government. The difficulty is that bad men succeed either as Repub licans or as Democrats, and they laugh at platforms and mock at public calamity. We admit that the Republican party is dishonored and disappointed by this kind of men in its ranks, but we charge that the same evil prevails to a greater extent in the ranks of the Democracy. Where is the corrective ? Will a third party promise not to prevaricate with promises, and engage not to speculate with public funds? This is just what both of the existing parties are pledged to discountenance. All platforms condemn prevarication and peculation. Then what can be done ? Purge existing par ties. Disrc-gaChl platforms in favor of honest and capable men. Let the mass of mankind, Who constitute all parties, look mote to the men than they do to the declaration of principles. Here is the remedy. The Repul >lican party was once so poor that its enemies could only charge it with fanaticism. It bad then great leader's and great ideas. The sway of the men who led the way was not disparted, and their action was never charged to dis honesty. The following was good. The men behind trusted the men in front, be cause through the entire mass there ran that spirit of confidence which is only bom of knowledge. Every man had been tried in his place. If this old sentiment could be revived, the Republican party would again rally the sentiment of the world.. What was that old sentiment? Reliance on the vir tue of mankind and trust in humanity. Good men are incapable of robbery or falsehood. The third party professes the same principle, but its chief aim is to secure honest and capable men. What is to prevent them from accomplishing this desire within the Republican organiza tion, which is already heralded by a bril liant reputation, and which marshals three millions of men in its ranks? Of this multitudinous army three-fourths are ad mitted to be intelligent, capable, honest, and patriotic citizens. They have no aim but the good of the country. All they ask is to be told the better plan, and they will be swift to adopt it They know the value of honesty and capacity. Point these out, and an overwhelming support is guaranteed. Then why intrude a new party, when an old one is better? We are moving on smoothly under Repub lican rule, and all that is needed is that the warts .shall be cut off and the ulcers extirpated. A new party would only serve to foster these evils by weakening the body, which is already healthy enough, with a little assistance, to throw them off. If, therefore, the third-party men have the public good in view, let them assist in curing an evil in a thrifty patient, instead of running off to build up a body that will suffer from evils that affect all parties. As the Sun says, there is no "use of a third party while the Republican organi sation only needs a little purification to make it all that the best patriot in the country can want. 

FORGET AND FORGIVE. Great unction has been applied to the nnregenerate heart of the Democracy, be cause some scavenger has hunted up and published in December, 1870, a letter written by Admiral Porter in January, 1865, wherein he wrote rather angrily of President Grant. Considering the ref lations that have existed between the President a^id the Admiral for the last two years, it is not pleasant to recall to the attention of the latter sentiments which he uttered six years ago, when he represented the sentiments of the navy concerning General Grant, who then rep resented'the afmy. * There was at that tisie, as will always ba the ease, a feeling of antagonism between the military and naval branches, and Admiral Porter, no doubt, partook of this feeling. As he says in his letter of explanation, in a moment of irritation, he committed his ideas to paper, and defended the right of the navy and protested against the favors that were shown to the laiMd service. .All men feel these sugges tions of anger at times, and if the private correspondence of the country could be overhauled and printed, most of our pub lic men would find themselves confronted by opinions which time and better in formation have operated to modify or dis pel. In the case of Admiral Porter, what he resented as an injustice to the navy in 18C5, may have been founded in his own error; and the opinion which he then held of General Grant, with whom he was then but partially acquainted, to-day may have been totally changed from a closer study of the man. General Grant had many enemies six years ago, who are his friends to-day; and parties who thought well of h im at that time, are his enemies at present His relation with Admiral Porter, at Washington, grew out of association, which is the best method to acquire friends, and their friendship should not be broken because of an opinion written in other years, when the two represented different interests. It seems to be taken for granted that the publication of this old letter will operate to disrupt the amity which has existed between the President and the Admiral. The Democrats are already rubbing their hands at the prospect of a quarrel between two men who are hateful to them. They would, probably, like to occupy Porter's place, if their own utterances could be forgotten or hidden out of sight. It will not do to turn aside to-day, because of what was said in the war by the representatives of different in terests. If that were the rule, probably there would not b® two friends left in the country. So we have peace but by for getting and forgiving. THE 

DRUIDS. The Grand Grove of the United .States, met yesterday at the Odd Fellows' Kali. Past Most Noble Grand Arch Friedrich turned over his chair of office to his suc cessor, Henry Warner, of New Jersey. The reports show the order to be on the increase. August Hitzfeld has, during the past year, planted the order in Galves ton, Texas. The Grand Council of tLe Supreme Arch Chapters met and elected the follow ing officers, who were formally installed: George Friedrich, of Missouri. Supreme Arch; George Henry Hart, of New York, Supreme Secretary; Charles V. Wilson, of New Jersey, Supreme Treasurer; P. L. Matheus, of Indiana, Senior Prelate; George H. Pabst, of Louisiana, Junior Prelate, and George H. Hart and August Hitzfeld, representatives to the Grand Grove of the United States. ON CABONDELET STBEET, There was nothing of importance to be noted yesterday in Carondelet street. As 'usual, for the last week the principal topic of conversation and discussion was Slaughterhouse stock, but there was a sensible abatement in transactions, al though, in the morning, it maintained its firmness, and even seemed to have an up ward look. According to the calculations of those who have investigated the mat ter, between 0000 and 7000 shares of this stock have changed hands within the last week, .and, in spite of these large sales, under the pressure of an almost unprece. dentediy stringent money market, the price has scarcely varied a point since Monday last. This is supposed to indicate great con fidence on the part of purchasers. It is, therefore, strange, that after so much stock has been sold, thus relieving sellers who were anxious to realize, the stock should have weakened last night. After ruling at about 25 for two days, it was offered last night, in the board, at 241 and 241. Sales were made of oO shares at the former figure, and the same number at the latter. The Calcasieu Sulphur Company have received late and very favorable advices from their mine, in Calcasieu parish. The work is proceeding even more rapidly than had been anticipated, and all the indications are favorable. So far, the boring shows precisely the same strata as were revealed by the first experi ment. The probabilities are, therefore, very great that the same formations will continue to be found as the work pro ceeds, and, consequently, that the sul phur bed will be reached at or near the expected depth. Among the sales! yesterday were 500 shares Navigation at S3 50, and 03 at S3 25. Within the last two days $10,000 State certificates have been sold at 02'.

In New York - the Demo crats were still counting the returns-en the fourth of December, although the election took place on the eighth of No vember. The good people of New York do not seem to be in such a hurry as we are, for they are making no indiscreet use of the Lord's name about the delay in counting the ballots in that city. We submit the question if it is conform able to etiquette for the Louisville Courier - Journal to write of the President's message as " gabble." If the editor is web-footed, it is presumed hie readers are jiot all geese. Gabble is a term applied to the poultry yard, and while Louisville claims to be a centre of humanity let her enforce the unities in her manner of conversation.
