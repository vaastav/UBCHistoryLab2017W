t\t JSbiiwtrat. HARVEY SICKLER, Editor. TUNKHANNOCK, PA. Wednesday, Deo. 10. 1862 Fair Notice to Our Subscribers. Our subscribers were notified last week of the late increase In the price of priQtiag pa per. It was then intimated that we would ) in order to meet this newspaper crisis, be obliged to make a change of some sort. stost if not all the newspaper publishers ra the country have raised the price of subscrip tion or reduced the xize of their papers. In some instances both there remedies have been adopted to save the publishers from an absolute loss of several dollars per week. For ourselves, hoping that this state'of af fairs will be only of temporary duration, we navo concluded to try and weather the storm, without making any change in the size of our paper or in our published terms, but only ih our practice in relation to them. Though our terms as published arc one dollar and fif ty cents in advance, and two dollars if not paid within six months, we have never yet demanded, or received, more than the sum first named, even though more than a year in some instances had elapsed from the time of subscription. a large number of our subscribers have neglected and still neglect to pay us for the past year. Now, therefore, TAKE NOTICE tftat we shall yet continue to publish the North Branch Democrat at one dollar and fifty cents if paid in advance. If not paid •Ivitliin six months, two dollars will positively be charged. We wish our subscribers to bear this in mind, as we intend to do just as We have stated. By punctuality every sub scriber will, therefore; save fifty cents. We do uot design to take any " suap judgment" dh'our subscribers, and will, therefore, give all in afrears for the pdst or present year, un til the third Monday of January next, (court week) to pay us at our ndvancee rates for the paper. After that date the rule we have above 6tated will be strictly adhered td. No one need presume 011 acquaintance or friend ship for a relaxation of it. Neither of these will buy paper. That is only procured by the cash. Prompt payments, therefore, is what we need and must have in order to pub fish our paper. We could not sustain our press at these rates, if we did not do our own wcrk, and work earlier , vurk later and roork harder than most people are willing to do. Apologetic. Our reasons, uo doubt, discovered tfinil in addition to a half sheet iastred by us last week, it was also about half printed. The defective printing arose from a change of weather and consequent hardening of what is known among printers as the "roller," cir cumstances over which we had no control. A new roller, the making of which required tnonev, time, ekill and .patience, has improved tftfe typographical appearance of our paper (Ml' Week?

PASSMOKE WILLIAMSON. —Our reader! will nearl j all recollect what a stir this negro philanthropist created in Abolition circles, in afew years ago. By his pretend ed love for the negro, he managed, some three years ago, to ghin the confidence of an aged colored woman, owner of some property in Philadelphia, lie drew a will in his own- hattd-w riling, and persuaded the woman to sign it in the absence of her husband and f/Snd*. The will set forth' tb&t'a siriall atftount should go to her husband, and the balance to Passmore Williamson 1 ® wife. The negro woman died recently, and her hQsband contested the will: The jury declared the will null and void. So much for negro phil authopy in Passmore. The severe illness of one of our com positors, has delayed the issue of our paper this week, for a few hours. The President's Message. We have been Compelled to chooio be tween publishing the President's message, to the exclusion of almost everything Alse, And lis entire omission. We have chosen the lat ter course tint as there ife a Very natural de sire to knbW something of the Contents of this doctiment, we will briefly State that is, mainly devoted to the three (Questions of our foreign relitionb, the finances and eftiancipa tidti. Our foreign relations remain undis turbed. In relation to the finances, the President knows of ho mode which promises so certain results as the drganization of bank ing associations under a general act of Con gress, well guarded in its provisions. The message favors African colonization, and 6ays the opinion among the blacks in this respect is improving. He endorses the proclamation act of Sep tember. He says there is no line straight pr crooked for a national boundary upon which to divide the Republic. He recommends the adoption of amend ments to the Constitution, prop-sing that ev ery State in which slavery exists shall abol ish the same therein, before tile Ist of Janu - ary, 1900, the owners to bo compensated by the United States. . , , All slaves who have enjoyed actual freedom by thd chances dT tiie war, at any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free ; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them. Cougress may appropriate money for colo nizing free colored persons with their own consent at any place or places without the United States. He urges these proposed articles at some length, maintaining that without slavery the rebellion never could have existed, and with out slavery it could not continue. 'l y \ie Journal of Commerce, speaking of the message, says : " The financial propositions of the Presi dent require no examination at the hands of men familiar with the laws of finance. They are rejected at once by the good sense of the experienced banker or financier, without a moment's hesitation. Again and again here tofore such plans have been examined, sifted, even tried, and they have always proved ru inous. At the present time especially they arc unfitted to the wants of the country. Any great change in the currency, such as is proposed, would produce commercial disaster everywhere. Before the change could be ef fected the majority of banks and bankers wfould be ruined, the people would be con vulsed with .financial embarrassments, and the distress Which would visit high as well as low would inevitably set the seal of condem nation on thfci propiosed system. Certainly the President and his advisers cannot have any dtear idea of the working of the laws of money. They need experience in the com mon affairs of the money world, or they nev er would have threatened us with a plau so crude, so manifestly worthlesss for all practi cal purposes, even if it he not entirely with out authority of the Constitution. Mr. Lincoln is evidently in earnest in his plans of emancipation. Ilis earnestness de mands that his views receive a careful, can did and studious examination by the people, and this they will have. But who can read them at a momcDt like this and not bo aston ished at their presentation as a means 6f bringing to an end the existing wai; which is destroying the nation ? We are compelled to say that the whole plan indicates a failure on the part of the President to appreciate the vastness of the war, the swift nature of its mfluenccs, the terrible verge on which the. country trembles. While Congress is dis cussing and adoptir?g rmendments to the Constitution, while the Legislatures of the States are and considering them, after Congress shall have done with them, while wo wait the chances of all the" free States and seven of the slave States agreeing to incorporate these propositions in the grand instrument of our national existence, the war goea on tearfully, and the blood of the people flows fast and—if this plan be our only hope —in vain! Mr. Lincoln makes that terrible error of imagining, as the radical men have taught him, that this war Is a war about slavery alone, that slavery is the causo of rebellion, disagreement, disunion. Me proposes to adopt a scheme of emancipation involving an immense debt, on the theory that if he can thus dispose of the slavery question he will have removed out of tho Way all causes of discord, tho American millenium will have dawned, and—no matter what it costs us— we have nothing to do but live on in peace and prosperity, with no domestic broils, no foreign war, no troubles, fto block to our prosperity, until we are a nation ef a hfindred millions—then pay our debt and be perfectly blessed. The theory is strange enough in peaceable times, it is with solemn sadness that we see it offered in these days of awful war. as a means of ending conflict and estab lishing national peace and union. To us it appears as impracticable and hopeless of good as letting go an anchor in mid ocean to save a vessel that is driving before a tempest, with torn sails and disheartened crew. What the People Pay Por. According to last accounts, General and : Senator 'Jim Lane' was on his way to the mines of Cfregoh with a drove ofcattlaon which he Wtmld make'fifty thousand dollars'. This is the filiate of his running tb and from Washington westward promising' in speeches and telegranVs to f;tlse thousands'of negro and other troops ! ITis pay of Senator and General, we prestime, still goes on ; and Wo couple him with Major General Cassibs M: "Clay, who, while his own State, Kentucky, is invaded by i the rebels,'flies from thence to stump .the State of New York for Wadsworth. The pay, rations and ti avoliug expenses of this brace of heroes must bo about one thousand dollars per month. AV*itH this basis for calculation, tax-payers can figure up the true value of their services to the nation, and find a <fuo t 'cnt.— if they can. Spirit or the Northern l'ress. •the Cincinnatti Enquirer, in refering to the demonstrations of the people in welcoming home some of the political prisoners who hare been discharged, "no fault being fon*d in them," says: The people turned out to welcome them as martyrs in the sacred cause of liberty and individual right, which had been cloven down in their persons. Those who have instigated and participated in these illegal arrests will be held to the severest responsibility. Math ew Lyon, a Democratic patriot of Vermont, who was fined and imprisoned for uttering Democratic sentiments in the days of the el der Adams, in 1793, bnder the sedition laws of the modern Abolitionists, had hi 6 fine of $ 1,000 refunded to him in 1840, forty-two years afterward. Exemplary damages will be given for years to every victim of false imprisonment in the loyal States in 1861 and 1862, during the reign of terror. The attempt to bind the par ties who have been kidnapped to an oath that they will riot seek legal redress for those wrongs, will prove as it ought, an utter failure* Somebody has got to answer for the enor mous outrages that have been committed against personal property in the last year. It is no slight matter to seize a man without warrant and confine him in a dungeon for months, and then confess that he is innocent by discharging fiitn without a trial. No dama ges can pay for such an injury. Of the hun dreds of Democrats who have been arrested ih the North by political violence, not one was legally arrested, nor was ever allowed a trial, but was pushed in a dungeon without one; Of the whole lot riot one had violated A law of the land, or transcended any of his constitutional privileges. Their arrest and iuipriionhicflt was simply an act of unmiti gated and despotic usurpation of power to the worst and vilest of purposes, and the gratifi cation of political and personal hate Thfe New York U'urld calls attention to the fact that its cotcmporanes, the Evening Post Times and Tribune, bul a few short months ago teemed with complaints of the " rose wa ter" policy of guarding property and endeav oring to restrain the scMier* from ravaging the country as they passed through and, says : Pope's savage orders were hailed as begin ning of a new era of sterner measures against the Rebels, and Senator Sherman's monstrous proposition that to "fight savage* we must be couie savages ourselves," was tacitly admitted to be true. But presto ! what a change lias come over the spirit of their dreams. The Government advertisedthe sale of some books left by their owners at Bmufort, South Caro lina. " This wont do," shouts the Post; „only barbarians make war on bdoks." " Its un christian, uncivilized,'' echoes the Times. "The freedmen, after they have learned how to read will want whatever books are sealed." adds the Tribune. And so Mr. Barney is compelled to adjourn the sale Indefinitely. We hail all this as an evid educe of return, ing reasen ; but will these j wrnals be good enough, now that thej'are s living up the laws of wat' afid the' usages ofo'vili.vd nations to point 6fft itid chapter and paragraph that will justify an enemy in seeking to incite a servile insurrection 1 lias it ever before been an appliance of warfare in ancient or motfe'frt times? Then again, if confiscating books is so very wrong, what shall we say to faw? coriffisc'alibg the entife property of a people with who.n we are at war ? Does not the Post, Times and Tribune see that in choaking over a very small gnat, they are swallowing a very large and very crooked camel—head, hoofs, humps, and all ? ''Snal! l!>? War Succeed" is the title of a significant article in the New York tr'orlu. It asks : "Who to-day is hopeful of the Sficcess of ovfr arms, of protracted immunity from foreign intervention, the conquest of an honorable peace and a reunited country, save only the radicals whose mcchinations have thrice cheat ed us of victories, whose lack of national spirit invites foreign insolence, and whose labor of years has been to belittle the value of the Union which they now pretend :o be alone able to save ? Who does not say in his secret mind that the future is unutterably dark, the hope of saving the nation feeble as never before 1 Who does not denounce— friend or foe—the imbecility of the adminis tration, the vascillations, of its policy the selfish intrigues of its highest members ? Who cannot trace to the beginning of the radi cal policy which now is dominant around the green baize of the cabinet table, the beginning and the cause of all our past disasters and our present hopelessness ? The evils which the men who now 6way the mind of President Lincoln combined with Southern extreimti is to being upon the nation, the same men now labor to make irremediable. But fur them the country would have been plunged into the present war. But for tliern (he war might to day be approaching its hororable and success ful termination. "Of the wai, as tiow conducted there is no visible end. Of the policy which now rules in the field and the council chamber, there is no issue except bankruptcy, foreign interven tion, separation, and a ruin of States and of people at which civilization itself stands ap palled. T.ie editor of the Louisville Joufnat ought to be ashamed of himself. Hear him i "Beware, O, ye rebel Women ! lest the fierce fire in your bosoms sets in a blaze the cotton in the same charming region." —— _—. i Lots of M6ney.' — The New York Inde penilent estimates that there are two hun dred millions of dollars idle in the banks of that crty.

The following letter handed us for publi cation will show, among other things, how an intelligent, fighting man, looks upon the re moval of McClellan. The writer with whom we are acquainted, was a Hepublicrn of the " strictest sect." He seems to differ with his stay-at-home Abolition friends in his estimate of hi 3 late Commander on some other points. It is fair to presume, that if he everlivfes to get home, he will never be found trainirig in that company again. CAMP NEAR POTOMAC CREEK, Va., ? Nov. 23, 1862. $ DEAR MOTHER : I now take my pen in hand to write a few lines to you in order to let you know that I am yet alive, and of my whereabouts. I suppose you think it is strange that I have not written to you before but it is not strange neither is it my fault. We took up our line of march the same day, therefore I have had no opportuni ty to write to any one. While on the march I received one from you, one from Un cle Eli, and one from Bishop Harris. I am glad to get them. It is a great consolation to mo to get a letter from friends at home. You may think it is not or I would answer them more promptly, but I have Worked hard to get this poor sheet of paper to write on. We have got no money nor anything else. We have not received a cent of money 6ince I sent you the forty-two dollars from Harri son's Landing. Neither is there any pros pect of our getting any very soon. IV e have now sixty-five dollars due us, I will try to state to you some of our hard ships and starvation. We have marched through mud up to our knees, and cold drenching rains and snow stontis both day and night. We haVe no tents nor are we half clothed. All that we hatfe had for the last three days is fonr hard crackers to the inan. Yot may think that I exaggerate, but mother lam not able to picture our hardships near as bad as tliej* are, and while we are here fighting for our country, the people of the North are a fighting us in the removal of Mc- Clellan. It is one of the most lamentable things that has ever happened to the Army of the Potomac. T think this war is getting to be a mixed lip mess. Tf 1 knew that T was fighting to free the niggers, I would desert to-morrow, if I Wa3 shot the sa'm'o day, and think it an honor instead of a disgrace. I think Gen. Bnrnside has run ns aground, and he will run us all under the ground ffhfc in tends to carry on a winter's campaign. We are almost smoked to death now. hovering around the camp fires; I have riot room to write all that I want to this time. This will have t) answer for all the letters that I have received at present. T want Uncle Eli to write to mo again. I want, you all to write. Do not wait for me. Give my best wishes to all of the friends. AH hsnds write coon and often. O. H. BENJAMIN; _ _— —.*. —— Retaliation, Jefferson Davis has instructed the Con • f federate oinm inder in the Missouri Depart- j ment to demand the surrender, by the federal j authorities, of Gen, McNeil, and in case his [ demand is r fusel, to h IUJ the first ten fed ercl i: 'i •?/•■> !h it fall into his h mils. This is d rc to retaliate for the execution of ten citi zens of Marion County, Ajissodri, by Gen. McNeil. A Union man of that county disappeared from his home, and his friends were unable to obtain any clue to his whereabouts. There upon Gen. McNeil caused the arrest of ten secessionists of the same county, and an nounced that if the missing man was not pro duced within a given time the ten prisoners would be shot. The time expired without bringing the return of the missing man. Gen. McNeil proceeded to carry uUi, threat. The ten citizens were taken out to a vacant lot placed on their knees beside their coffims, a platoon cf soldiers drawn up in front, and the terrible tragedy enacted. To add to the horror of the scene, only four or five of the victims were killed at the first fire. The officers rushed forward and shot the bahtnee wiili their revolvers. Yet it was not known at the tiitfe, not has it been certainly ascertained to this day. whether the missing man is dead or living. If the ten citizens killed by McNeil had been in the service of the rebel Confederacy, the case might have been different.—As Jit is, they were unarmed citizens of a State which is now, as it always lias been, an ally and member of the United States.— Carbon demo crat. Since the above was written we sec it sta ted in our exchanges, that the missing man refereu to lias returned home, safe and souud. Whether fhis be true or not, Gen McNeil has earned for a reputation for brutality and barbarity, that will link his name, in all time to come witli that of Jeffries who held, what history designates as the " bloody assi zes" in the west of England.— Ed.

About one year ago the town had its abo lition spies, who full of patriotism to the chin, imagined themselves the Ivnight-Ei rants of the Administration, to garble conversation and smell treason to be reported Heaven knows where, for the action of Star Chamber Inquisitions.

An Abstract Deeo. — Having rout teefh ! drawn. | THE PRESIDENT AND LIBEI.TY —The Evening j Post favors the county with the following as ' tounding piece of intelligence, which the order ! of Mr. Stanton, this day published, partially confirms : "The President is fully convinced that the sense of the county 13 overwhelmingly against anything savoring of tyranny or of military clespotism." Is he, IndSted ?

Had an eneiny put his scorn tipon us it had been easier to bear. But that an American journal should thds, in the language of a court flunk ey, recn>d the shame of the land, is alinost tdo much fof mortal patience; Quite too much for mortal patience, a trial beyond all imagined for Job, is the same journal's explanation of the process through which this light has reached the presidential mind s "Some of ihe arrests made hare been unne cessary and unjust, and the administration has suffered for its mistakes." The "administration has suffered," mark you—not the American citizens "nnneces6ari ly and unjustly arrested hot American liberty indecently outraged ; not the Ameri can name made a laughing stock and scandal of the world, but the administration !" The temporary servants of the people have been made to tremble for their wages ; the in triguers of party for the success of their schemes. Can the force bland, unconscious basenese further go ? —AT Y. World. jg'-y Speaking of the infamous outrage upon Mrs. Brinsinade's liberty in New York, a contemporary says:—"All such arrests and imprisonments will be abolished in this State on the first of January, with the instal lation of the new Governor, who will permit no man to be arrested or detained contrary to law. And if, after that date, arty one of the Secretaries who hare authorized such proceedings, should show himself in this vi cinitj-, he stands a good chance of being ar rested himself, and placed in so secure a place that it will be found very difficult to take him out." .
