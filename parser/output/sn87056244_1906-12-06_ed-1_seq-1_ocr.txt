PLYMOUTH TRI BUNE V 1 J V TOLUME VI PLYMOUTH, INDIANA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1906. NO. 9 ;! 1 5 . i :i i it y it S i 4, J. i J", I, .1 I r f'V SCORES RICH WOMEN. Patronesses of Tillman Lectures Are Excoriated. - Dr.v jenkins Lloyd Jones," one of the speakers at a mass meeting of negroes held at Bethel chapel, Chi cago Sunday, excoriated those wom en of fashion who permitted their names to be used as patronesses in connection with the Tillman lecture. He said the very use of their names did more harm than did all the rabid utterances of the senator from South Carolina. He bemoaned the fact that women would go to that length in the name of charity. He sard that it would be better a thousandfold to have the two greatest pugilists in the world battle for supremacy. He said the women would do less injury t the community if they lent their -lames to such a battle and it were fought for charity. "And his words sermed to find an echo among those who lis tened, for the resolutions that were adopted denounced in terms that were scathing those women connect ed with the coming of Senator Till man. . The meeting of Sunday afternoon . was a remarkable one. Bethel chapel is the- largest negro church in the cityi " yet its auditorium was inade quate and an overflow meeting was held in the basement, that part of t'as structure that is used for a Sunday school room. Many of the speakers were White men, divines prominent in the city. Bishop Fallows presided and among those who spoke were Rev. M. C. Hartzell, pastor of the Park Avenue Methodist church and son of Bishop Hartzell; Dr. A. K. De Blois, pastor -of the- First Baptist church; Patrick H. O'Donnell, Wil liam' Farmer and Dr. C. E. Bentley spoke for the negroes Although the meeting was schedul ed ' as a peace gathering that the friendly relations between the white men and the negroes of Chicago 'might be furthered, there were utter ances that did not speak of peace be tween the races as a whole. Bishop Fallows predicted that if the words of the South Carolina senator came true and there was a war of racei be tween the whites and the negroes in the south it would be another in which ' the fathers would be compell ed to face their sons. There were more than 1,000 ne groes in the audience when Bishop Fallows was introduced. "The call that brought me here h one'of duty as well as privilege," he began, and was cheered. "I did not hear. Senator Tillman speak &nd thank God for that.. lie continued, and. the cheers that broke forth made it Impossible for him to proceed. "But what of his reception? Is ii not u direct contrast to that which would have been accorded the senior senator 'of Illinois had he invaded Charleston and told an audience the simple truth that there were 1,000,000 or more of African descent having more ofthe blood of the white than the black, in their veins? , Would they have relished that? Would they have pinned a Pullman ticket on his coat? "There lives a man in South Car olina, native and to the manor born, who has devoted forty years of his life to the uplifting of the negro race. He fired the first shot of the civil war. He is in marked contrast to thi senator who was too young or some thing else to enter the confederate army. What if Mr. Tillman were to be in that kind of war that he pre diets and upon the side he says he -would choose? He would be upon the side of fathers arrayed against sons and they would not lave to fight the ilack man but fight the white man 3n the black man and that combina tion would be one that would make Tillman wish he had never been. But there will no be race war And then came a roar from the negroes. Cannot Control School Boards. The appellate court now holds that a school trustee is not n officer of the civil cky, and that the school corporation ia not a corporation "in which the city is interested, within the meaning of the law; therefore, the council's power, pt supervise, in vestiate, etc., as above set forth, does not extend to school trustees. Under the present law, since 1005, when the council appoints school trustees it at once loses all control over them and they are left to their responsibility and to the people. The council cannot compel an investiga tion of the books and papers of the school beard. The case just decided arose , out of the- refusal of the treasurer of the Valparaiso school board to submit lira books and accounts to an exam ination by the finance committee of the council, under a resolution of the council. He admitted the right of any citirent as such ,to examine his records but denied the right of the council, as such, to do so, and he was sustained by the judge of the circuit court. An appeal was taken and agai i he was sustained, the council having meantime squandered a neat sum of city money in the litigation. Dies of a Broken Heart. "Died of a broken heart," is the attending physician's verdict as to the cause' of death of Mrs. Catherine B. Shafer of Washington, D. C, a sis ter of. Mrs. Anna Haslanger of Ply mouth Mrs. Shafer's only, daughter and her son-in-law died a few days oreviously and were buried side by sidr, and Mrs. Shafer could not live under her load of grief. The Prosecutor's Office. In a letter tö friends in South- Bend James A. Cooper, jr., prosecutor of Vigo county, this state, a resident, of Terre Haute, defines the prosecutor's office as follows: "The office of prosecuting attorney is one of narrow powers, if the in cumbent seeks to keep himself within a narrow scope. It is an office of very wide powers, searching into- every element of the life of the community, if the incumbent strikes out in all directions and is willing to come again and again after being beaten back. I have merely kept hammering away wherever I felt good could be accomplished and have been guided by the one consideration of what would best serve the whole people of Vigo county. There tiave been suc cesses and failures, praise- and criti cism, and at the end of it all I be lieve I see some good to the public." There is the kind of man for pros ecutor; a man who is not a grafter; a man who is not afraid to do his duty; a man who does not split hairs as to just what that duty is; a man who desires to cater to the best ele ments of citizenship instead of to the worst; a man who respects his oath of office instead of dishonoring it; a man who has the courage to take the initiative; a man who does not hide behind the lamentable excuse, File an affidavit and I will prose cute;" a man who makes the prose cutor's office broad and not narrow; a man with common sense; a man who is a good example for every prosecutor in Indiana. When some of the milk and water prosecutors of this state read about James Cooper it must give them a twinge of conscience if they, realize their miserable weakness and their frightful shortcoming. Keep Going. Nothing in nature stands still. If ft isn't dying it is growing; if it isn't growing it is dying. This is as true of men as of plants. A creature equ pped with muscle and mind must use both every day or the muscle will soften and mind will shrivel More than that when body and brain fail to grow, the spirit, with all its power' over life and usefulness and happiness, is the first element of man to signal distress, So it is with old Franklin Farrel, the head of a foundry and machine company in Ansonia, Conn. He is simply guarding his' own happiness by griming his hands in his mill in sphe of his seventy-eight years. By the measure of monej he has earned retirement, for he is said to be a mil lionaire several times over.. By the measunre of hard work, he has surely tarned it. But he keeps to overalls and his machine shop just the same He has found out that work and work alone will keep him young aid well. .. v A news item in a recent paper say that Mr. Farrel tried once to "retire." Rheumatism seized him immediitely If he had not found instant other, oc cupation for both his mind and- hi? body, the disease would have made him its own until he died. Inteaj. he jumped back to his work, got wel". and has kept well. Many men and women who h-wc done a serious work faithfully may reasonably hope for rest when they get as far as this foundryman. B".t they won't rest in idleness. Neither will they find happiness. The only things they will find are stagnation and hypochondria. Rest is a kind of work which uses the faculties in a -new way. If you can't find that kind of work the only thing that remains to do is to follow old Franklin Farrel and keep to' your bench. Big Four Proscuted. Attorney General Miller has filed a' suit in the Marion superior court for the state railroad commission against the Big Four railroad com pany to compel that company to make proper distribution of cars of coal delivered to it for shipment by the Southern Indiana and the Evans ville & Terre Haute railroad com ranies. The grounds of the suit are the failure of the Big Four to handle and deliver cars consigned to it by either of these roads for the gas belt and other localities and Its failure o return cars which have been accept ed. It is alleged that instead of re turning cars which it has accepted the Big Four has reloaded them and has sent them to other parts of the country, mainly to the Wet Virginia coal fields, where they have been loaded again and this time with West Virginia coal, which has been ship ped back to the Indiana market but for which Indiana must pay a higher price. The reason the Big Four does this, it is alleged, Is a selfish one, as it gets more pay on long hauls. This has been carried on to such an extent that Indiana roads refuse to deliver coal to the Big Four for shipment The case will be pushed, as the al leged practice leaving the Indiana gas belt in a coal famine. Rather Late in Starting. On behalf of the wife and daughter o f Isaac N. Rodegeb Nappanee citi zens have asked the Elkhart county authorities to institute a search for him. After disposing of real estate agency interests in Nappanee last April Rodegeb worked in Elkhart for awhile as a carpenter for S. C. Kindy, then disappeared wittt 4,000 of his savings. The authorities think the relatives have waited too long be fore giving publicity to his disappearance. Consuelo Gives Up All. .Whether it be true, as their friends persist in reasserting, that either the dukq of Marlborough or his duchess will presently sue for divorce to gain the freedom that each desires, signi cant happenings point to a separation as complete in life, I not in law, as that of Mme. Gou'd ard her Boni. Within the last nior.th changes have gone on quietly at Sunderland house that show the thoroughness of the duchess' methods in reorganizing her pla of life. The chef who was tranferred from Blenheim , nearlj three years .ago to officiate in the kitchens of the great London home of the ducal pair has returned to the palace. With him have gone two old re tainers of the Marlboroughs, while the two nurses who attended the young marquis of Blandford and his brother Lord Ivor Spencer Churchill, have been sent down with the boys to their father's residence. All the personal belongings of the children have been packed up and taken along. Even the little keep sakes and tender remind;rs of their babyhood have gone back to Blen heim, as if their mother had resolved to clear away all trace of that old life and start anew on an unblottcd page. The splendid china, adorned with the Marlborough crest and cor onet; the quantities of unique silver heirlooms and the most minute pos sessions of the family, collected through hundreds of years, hav been dispatched to the duke. Her grace has lkewise discarded the stationary bearing the ducal crest! She now uses'note paper head ed only with her address. In fact, in all but name she has scrupulously put aside the indications of her rank. The duchess is to spend Christmas with Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt in Paris, where she has always con trived to pass much of her time. She will go south with her father and his wife for the new year and the report is now current that instead of the French capital Consuelo, will choose one of the Italian cities, prob ably Florence, for her permanent abode. This would seem to give color t the story of divorce, with the impli cation that the Wife may figure in the proceedings as the plaintiff. Tillman and the Negroes. It must be infinitely discouraging to a sober-minded, hard-working. useful citizen like Booker T. Wash ington to have a violent'agitator like Senator Tillman going armrnd the country and oing his best to tear down what, at such great pains, is being built up in the way of order and progress among the colored peo pie ot mis country. Tillman has been a monomaniac. who sees the whole world black, ar.d in the seeing and in the telling of it he becomes himself so jellow that the outbursts of Chicago negroes on his approach were hardly-surprising. We can assure the negroes, how ever, that just as the future is not f-o black as Tillman sees it, neither is it so yellow as they see it when Till man Is In sight. The future as it con cerns the relations of the . races- in this country is full of serious difficult problems. The leaders of both races know that only too well. But the white race is not made up of Till- mans any more than the black race is made up of the particular kind of "brutes, worse than animals," which Tillman revels in describing. Nor is there a tendency among the white? to develop Tillmans any more than there is. a tendency among the blacks to develop ruthless criminals. Rec ord Herald. kust Be a Strong Man. Should President .Rosevelt be elected again, properly speaking, it would only be a second term, but the President has always given the peo ple to understand that he regarcs the unexpired term of Mr. McKinley, which he was called upon to fill, as a first term. Mr. Roosevelt has seen fit to announce aga'n that lie is net a candidate for re-election; to friends he says he would not accept a re nomination. So great is Mr. Roose velt's popularity and such is his rep utation for doing things that the peo ple are little disposed to take him a: his word. But the president is pos itive in whatever he says and does, and it seems that in all probability he must be considered outside the coming presidential race. The late election was an endorsement of pro gressive Republicanism. The prin ciples of the party haven't changed to any g'"at decree, but Mr. Roose velt vitalized them to a remarkable extent, judging by the recent ejection with Mr. Roosevelt out of the race, it Is evident that the Republican can didatr, to PC successful must De a man of the Roosevelt type, one wno has the courage and ability to carry on the fightfthat Roosevelt has be gun and waged whh success. War saw Times. Elks Are Defendants. The prosecuting attorney has be gun proceedings against the Elkhan and Goshen lodges of Elks asking for forfeiture of their charters as organi zations. The action is based upon indict ments recently returned by the grand jury of Elkhart county. The pro ceedings are identical with those which were brought against Tom Taggart, proprietor of the Trench Lick Springs hotel, where large gambling casinos have been in oper ation some time. The Elkhart lodge is known as No. 425 and the Goshen lodge as No. 798. Governor Johnson of Minnesota. While Governor Johnson, of Min nesota, may never be the Democratic candidate for the presidency, we still think that the Boston Traveler is right in suggesting that he may be a man with a- future. For some unac countable reason he has attracted comparatively little attention. It may be because he is not an advertiser. It is possible that he is a man of the Hitchcock type, who docs things without getting into the limelight. But he must have good, and even re markable qualities, or he could never have been twice elected Governor in so strong a Republican State as Min nesota. Two years ago, when-, the State gave Mr. Roosevelt a plurality of 161,000, Mr. Johnson was elected by a plin-ality of 6,352. And this year he was re-elected, his plurality being more than 70,000. Jdhnson's mother and father are both Swedes, though he was born in this country- The only office he ever held prior to his election as Gover nor was that of State Senator. He always seems to have done his duty in every relation of life. The Boston paper says that in his first campaign his opponents resorted to "personal ities of the nastiest sort," charging that his father was a drunken Swed ish immigrant, and his mother a washerwoman. "He paid no attention to these foolish attacks, but made "a clean,., aggressive campaign," and was elected in the great Roosevelt year. Here is a page out of his record dur ing his first term: When Johnson became governor he was 'he same old Johnson. Didn't make much noise, but he did things. He made the Railroad Commission take action that gave the farmers and shippers of the State better rates on their freight. He stopped the fraud in the timber land leases, and saw to it that the State got its due from the steel corporations and others who leased the State's land, and was prominent in the insurance reform agitation. He picked out good men for office, regardless of whether they were with him or against him before election, and his administration was so clean and aggressive that instead of his plurality of 6,000 two years ago, he had more than 70,000 thi year. It is i great thing for the Dem ocratic party that it has been grow ing such men as Governor Johnson, of Minnesota. A second generation Swede, he has all the virility of the newer races, tempered with what i best in American character. Democ racy can afford to put a mark against the name of Governor John A John son, of Minnesota. Chicago Tribune What Waterways Develop. Between May and December, 1905, thirty-four million tons of or was shipped from the Lake Superlo mines to Lake Erie ports. This traf fic greatly exceeds the total pass-ing through the Suez canal. Facilities for handling the mountain of freight have grown with its growth. One railroad has constructed two docks, located at Buffalo and Erie, that un load 2,200,000 tons ot ore during the season of navigation. The depth o! water at these docks is sufficient for the largest boats. Massive electric machinery unloads the ore and then puts on board a return cargo of coal. At the Buffalo dock 500 tons of ore an hour is transferred by machinery directly from a ship to a train that runs along the face of the dock, and storage bins are at hand that hold 250,000 tons each. Up to four years ago a steel bucket holding a ton was lowered into a versel and filled by hovelers. Now self-filling baskets, each of five to ten tons capacity, are used, and no shov elers are needed. The deep lake, chan nels have brought about the big fehips and these in turn have expanded the methods of loading and unloading. Economic gains are large and added to every year Let no one undertake to deal with river improvment on the basis of the commerce on the present unimproved river channels. Big ves sels, with assured depth of water, create conditions of their own. They have never failed in this respect, and will not work differently on the main streams of the Mississippi valley. The Dying Statesman. The death of Joseph Chamberlain, which is said tö be near at hand, will mark an epoch in the political his tory of England. Not since Gladstone has the British empire boasted of as profound a statesman. Four months ago he was confined to his house with fout. Since he has suffered a paralytic stroke so' severe that xht end cannot long be delayed, says the Kansas City Star. As picturesque as Disraeli and more able than either Salisbury or Balfour, he leaves a remarkable im press upon the hjstory pf England From the day be left hjs father's shoe shop to seek his fortune he has been restless, impatient and am bjtiou. He was a member of Glad stone's cabinet, but broke with him over the Irish isme. He sits today a pathetic, aged man in a garden of orchids, his-brain all but numb and the sun of life swiftly sinking into the dark waters. Al though the sum total of his life was success beyond his fellows he never became prime minister. This failure only demonstrated his strength of character, for he at all times sacri ficed personal ambition to stand for reforms which he conceived to be for his country's best interest. It has been said truthfully of him that he knew better than any other man the strength and weakness of his coun try. The Jew in American Politics. Jews are beginning to form such a large element in the American popu lation, ami so many of them have figured prominently in all sorts ol activities in the United States, that it seems odd that Oscar S. Straus, of New York City, whom President Roosevelt has recently selected for secretary of commerce and labor, should be the first to enter the cab inet. Mr. Straus himself has been in the diplomatic service, having been a minister to Turkey. Many Jews have been in each . branch of Con gress. Several of them, including Maryland's senior senator, Isador Rayner, are in Congress now. Some of them have been on the federal bench. But Mr. Straus will be the' first member of a president's official family. It is a notable distinction most worthily bestowed. In American journalism, from the days of Mordecai M. Noah, ot the old Courier ind Enquirer, of New York, down to those of Joseph Pul itzer, of the New York World, Adolf S. Ochs, of the New York Times and Philadelphia Ledger, and Ed ward Rosewater, of the Omaha Bee, who died a few weeks ago, Jews have beert prominent. Jacob II. Schiff, Isaac N. Seligman, Edward Lautcr baeh, Henry Siegel, Walter Dam rosch and Felix Adler are among the scores of Jews who have a national prominency in their various fields ot work. Moreover, the relative con spicuousness of the Jews is increas ing. For one reason this is because the Jewish- ingredient is growing faster than any other element of the American population. Of the 11,000,- 000 Jews in Uie world, Russia has 5,000,000, Austria Hungary, 2,000,000, and the United States, 1,500,000. And while the number is decreasing in Russia and is stationary in Austria Hungary, it is- increasing in the Unit ed States with great rapidity. Be fore 1910 we will pass Austria-Hungary in Jewish populaton, and by 1925 we will beat Russia and take the leading place among the world's communities as a residence of the descendants of Abraham. New York City has 750,000 Jews, which is half the aggregate for the United States; which is more than there is in any entire country in the world except Russia, Austria-Hun-; gary and the United States, which is r.cven times as many as are in Lon don, and which is 30 times as many s are in Jerusalem. New York has times as many Jews today as were in Jerusalem during the height of Jewish power, when that city was one of the world's great capitals.' Ev ery fifth person met on the streets of New York City today is .a Jew. And the Jew's social and business importance exceeds even his numeri cal strength. Ingratitude of Republics. William McKinley, although no relative of the late President, is in the Providence Hospital in Washing ton, and Civil War veterans all over the country will mourn at the news. McKinley, although not an enlisted man, was one of the moTt 'trusted engineers on the military trains of the Union forces during the Civil war. It has often been said of him that he was "shot up" sq offen nd maimed in sq many rajlwav accidents the resujt of trajn wrecking dqrini the conflict, frht he resembled 4 hu man sieye when the war ended. Mc- Kinjey's first wMrk for the govern ment was when he was summoned to drive th locomotive that drew the train on which Abraham Lincoln traveled from Philadelphia to Wash ington to be inaugurated. For years McKniley was on the payroll of the postofficc department as a laborer at $730 a year, but a short time ago he was retired because of disability. The worry over his dismissal aggravated the suffering he experienced because of old war wounds and he finally hid to be taken to a hospital. His case is a sad proof of the ingratitude of republics. He is without pension, al though Congress at one time consid ered the matter. Nothing was ever done and the old man who did so much for the nation in its days of travail, is practically without funds, should he recover. Office Greater Than the Man. Once when Gov. Douglas occupied the exerutive chambers on Beacon hill he went to Provincetown for a week end visit, says the Boston Her ald. Saturday afternoon the deacons of the Methodist church learned that he was to attend that place of wor ship, and hung a glaring poster to that effect on the outer walls. The next day the church was packed, and as the chief executive of the com monwealth entered everybody aroc and stood in respectful silence until he was seated. The next year he was again a visi tor tq the Cape town, and attended the same church. Only half the seats were occupied when he came In, and not a soul stood up. "It's the office rather than the man that receives at tention In Provincetown," said Mr. Douglas to a friend after the' ser vices. Rumblings on the Rail The Lake Erie trains Saturday commenced running into" the Lake Shore station. The coming of the trains down town is proving a decid ed convenience to the people. It als means that the Lake Erie will cut Into the business of; the street ci company on Laporte-Michigan City butlness for the rate on the Lake Erii is less than on' the interurban. Laporte Herald. Thanks by Everybody. Some hae meat that canna eat, And some would eat that want it; But we hae meat, and we can eat, Sae let the Lord be thankit. So sang Burns, and he voiced an almost universal sentiment. There is no discrimination of race, or na tion, or religion in thanksgiving. The only unfortunate who is barred from its satisfaction is the atheist He has nobody to whom he can be thankful, and yet, on a pinch, even he might return thanks to nature tor its be neficence. Of course it would be rather an abstract proposition a sort of address "to all whom it may con cern" but it is perhaps better than nothing. ' I The" rest of the world can unite in tnanksgiving tor all that they consid er blessings, or good fortune, or whatever one may be pleased to call it. And they all address the same Source of Blessings Father of all! in every age, In every clime adored, By saint, by savage, and by sage, Jehovah, Jove or Lord. The call of Thanksgiving day Is to all, Christian or Hebrew, Catholic or Protestant, and likewise the pa gan who is within our gates, the Chinaman who has managed to es cape immigration laws, and rnc In dian who still holds to his primitive worship of the Great Spirit There is no recognition of the Divine Being in the national Constitution, but the Declaration of Independence refers to "Nature's God," and the vast ma jority xf America's people accept a Dcrty. And all who have that faitTi realize the duty of giving thanks. It has al ways been so. ' Thait fine old pagan, Seneca, rebuked the ungrateful thus: We can be thankul to a friend for a few acres, or a little money; and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth, and for the great benefits of our being; our life, health and reason, we look. upon ourselves as under no obligation." Surely there are few in this land who have not something to be thank ful for, and those who have cause for thanksgiving should see tha those who have not are as few as possible. Nothing adds more to one's happiness than making others happy, and he who finds opportunity to do a good deed has cause for special thanksgiving. That opportunity is worth seeking. It . can usually be found by those who are seeking for it. Indianapolis Star. Met an Unusual Death, An uuusual display of the faithful ness of the dog is brougttt to light in the. death of .John Cross In La grange county a few days ago. The circumstances attending the death of Mr. Cross were peculiar. He lived in a small house near the vil lage of Honeyville. Thursday night until 11 o'clock he was at the home of one of his neighbors. On his way home across the .fields Cross was stircken with heart failure and was not discovered until 4 o'clock on the following afternoon. The fences had blown down on an adjoining farm and the farmer spent considerable Jtme Friday fixing them up. He noticed a dog on the other side of the fence sitting for hours apparently watching something. The dog went home at dinner rime, but later the animal came back to the same place. The farmer finally con cluded that there must be something lying there, and upon investigation found It to be Mr. Cross, who was still alive but very weak. He died a short time after his body was dis covered. Prison for a Girl Forger. Elsie Jacobs, the 18-year-old col lege student of Mount Pleasant, la., who attempted to swindle the First National Bänk of Galesburg out of $1,000 by means of a bogus check, was sentenced in the Circuit Court at Galesburg to an indeterminate term in the penitentiary. Miss Ja cobs is an unusually attractive girl and comes from wealthy parents. Early in September she appeared in Monmouth and registered at Mon mouth College." Two days later she attempted to casli a forged order for $S00 on the First National Bank of that city. When the officers of the bank refused to give her the money she left the city, going to Galesburg where she gained entrance into Knox College and an indorsement to a check on the First National Bank of that city. She cashed the check, but was discovered as sbe was leav ing the city. The Program of Congress. There seems to be a general con census of opinion that little will be done at the session of Congress that began Monday except to pass the ap propriation bills, and possibly to force through the ship subsidy bill. Indeed,, there is not time to do much, for the session expires March 4 next by constitutional limitation. It is almost certain that the tariff will not be touched. Nor is it probable that the laws recently enacted will be strengthened. It will be argued that there has not yet been time for them ot prove their value. And Congress will be disposed to wait until it can learn something from experience with them. Some subject? may have to be considered, such as the status of the Porto Ricans, the Philippine tariff and the Santo Domingan and Algeciras treaties. Congress may, too, have to deal with the Japanese complication. But Congress will be likely to postpone till its next session whatever can possibly be postponed. Choosing National Senators. The Iowa legislature during its last session authorized the governor of that state to invite the other states to send five delegates each to a confer ence in Des Moines to consider the subject of amending the national con stitution so as to provide for the election of United States senators by popular vote The governors of more than thirty states have accepted the- invitation and the delegates meet in conference Wednesday. All the New England governors and the governor of New York have declined to send delegates, all, or nearly all, on the ground that they have no statutory authority to do so. It may be a warranted infer ence that, the governors of those states are not favoraoly disposed toward the popular election of na tional senators. The understanding is that the ob ject of the conference is not to con sider whether it would be wise to amend the constitution ts proposed but how the amendment can best be secured. Such being the case, gover nors opposed to the change would be unlikely to appoint delegates. They would, of course, be unwilling to appoint men who were in favor of the change and they would hardly feel at liberty to appoint men who were opposed to it Of the' two prescribed ways of amending the national constitution the one to which alone resort has hitherto been had looks rather un promising. The amendment must be formulated and proposed to the states by congress and it must be pro posed by a two-thirds vote of both houses, and the presumption is pretty strong that it will be difficult to in duce two-thirds of the senators to rote for the measure. The proposal to change the mode of choosing senators is not compli mentary to the present senators. It implies that the legislatures do not choose good senators and that the people think they can "do better by choosing them at the ballot box. Sen ators can hardly be expected to ex press their acquiescence in this view by voting to change the method. If they are as bad as the demand for the change implies they almost cer tainly will not vote for it. If they arc good senators there is very strong reason why they should vote for it. The Des Moines conference results from a recognition of the difficulty of inducing two-thirds of the sena tors to admit that they are not as good as they ought to be and that the people ought to have a chance to drop them and put better men in their places. Chicago Chronicle. Senator Gallinger Offers Fight. Senator Gallinger, of New Hamp shire, arrived in Washington Sunday night in a combative mind. He served notice upon Representative Burton of Ohio, chairman of the house com mitee on rivers and harbors, that if the latter opposed ship subsidy legis lation this winter the river and har bor bill would be cut into ribbons when it reached the senate. Senator Gallinger said: "Mr. Burton should understand from the beginning that if he inter poses any obstacle in the way of shipping, there will be some men in the senate who will scrutinize care fully the provisions of the river and harbor bills. "There is no logical reason why we should improve rivers and harbors, expend hundreds of millions to im prove the highways of commerce for the benefit of foreign shipping, and refuse to appropriate a mere pittance for the rehabilitation of American merchant marine." Field Distribution Ended. Distribution of more than $300,000 left by the will of Marshall Field to twenty-five faithful employes, who had seen long service in the great house which he had established, was practically completed Monday. Mr. Field left $300,000 to employes whose names and the amounts were men tioned. In addition he bequeathed $100,000 in a lump sum to be distrib uted among others who had been in service twenty-five to forty-one years Almost a year of hard work on the part of astute business men was con sumed in apportioning the lqmp sum equitably among the employes. Job Goes Begging. . A job which pays $6,000 a year is going begging in Washington. The secretaryship of the Smithsonian in stitution, which is considered the most exalted scientific position In America, was offered last spring to David Starr , Jordan, but' he has de clined it because he draws $10,000 a years as president of Leland Stanford University. Other eminent scientific men have turned a deaf ear to the proffered vacancy at the Smithsonian Institution and the Board of Regents will have a perplexing task before it in December, when it will mevt to elect a successor to the late Prof. Samuel P. Langley. St Boniface Elects Officers. At the regular meeting of St. Bon iface Benevolent Society Sunday ev ening the following . officers were elected for the ensuing year: Presi dent, W. G.

A large number of the business men and other prominent citizens of Plymouth visited the new plant of the Monarch Iron Works in the west end of the city Friday evciz wit ness the process of molding, looked at the new building zzid exi-.izzd the up-to-date machinery of the plant. Everybody was pleased and sur prised at the ' facilities for turning out work and at the possibilities for building up an . immense factory in Plymouth. At a meeting of business men held after visiting the planf, the ques tion of Plymouth capitalists, business men and others taking stock in the factory was discussed, and there was a general opinion that a ltitle help just now might prove of great ad vantage to the factory and to those taking stock and also to every prop erty owner and workingman in Ply mouth, and we think full particulars can probably be obtained by calling on W. H. Matthew. The reception given the business men at the fouudry was very pleasing and each man was presented with a souvenir of tfie work done there. Congress ia Ctccica. With "Uncle Joe" 'Canon in hap piest vein, and Vice President Fair banks in dignified attitude, both ses- soins of the house of congress began Monday. 1 After both bodies had or ganized the clerk called the roll. Nine Smiths answered in the house. "Once.- said "Uncle Joe," "every body's name was Smith. Whenever any one committed a crime he changed his name. What a band , of rascals we must be. I'm mighty glad there are a few Smiths left." There were eight new members in the house. Afterward both houses ap pointed committees to wait on the president. Tuesday afternoon the president's message went to con gress. ' The opening of the": senate was marked by unexpected Introduction by Mr. Penrose of a resolution call ing upon the president for informa tion concerning his recent order dis missing three negroes companies from the army. The chair called at tention to the custom that no busi ness should be transacted until the president had been officially heard from, but Penrose insisted. Senator Foraker was on hi3 feet in an in stant, calling for the records in the case from the secretary of war. Spec tators looked at each other in mild surprise, realizing tbat.jthe president had been outwitted in breaking pre cedents, and protests were heard. Penrose finally based his plea on unanimous consent, a request seldom denied, several senators striving for recognition. Tension was high for a time but Vice President Fairbanks announced that the .resolution would go over. The President also smashed all precedent by sending in nis new cab inet nominations before he had (been notified tht congress was in session.- Both houses, however, adjourned until Tuesday afternoon to receive the President's message. Scaricity of Pos tc Gee Clerks. The other day a civil service exam ination for postoffice clerks was held in Chicago. The examiners were anx ious to get a large list of eligibles and hoped for 600 applicants. Just thirty-nine men, however, presented themselves. Perhaps half of these will qualify, but they will be only a drop in the bucket compared with the need, for positions are waiting for 200 men right now. So gTeat is the pressure that it was reported from Washington a day or two ago that the civil service commission was talking of making the examina tion less stringent While this would cause a deterioration in the quality of the new clerks it would at least pro vide some of the men who are need ed. It is not hard to fund the cause for this shortage of men. The pay offered is entirely inadequate. In some branches of the service it is just what it was thirty years ago, despite the great increase in the cost of liv ing. Postoffice clerks begin at $400 and increase slowly. The positions that pay above $1,000 are few, and are really in the executive staff rath- )er than in the staff of clerks. Letter carriers in large cities begin at $600 and may reach $1,000. Railway pos tal clerks receive from $S00 ot $1500 but" humfreds of them with excep tionally short runs receive less than the minimum of the schedule. . Ctcpiijn Echcts. A good one came to us recently in the form of a dialogue between Un cle Leonard Allman and Louie Hess after this fashion. Mr. Allman said about election tim e "Weh Louie campaigning a'irct as it used to be when we were down at Argos taking the wavering, brethren back in tue al ley and letting them look up into our bottles, and the fellow that had the biggest bottle and iet them look last was the one that got the vote. But they do things different up here; I don't understand it quite, and the game is most too fast and furious for you too, a'int it Louie. About all you can do is to make it unanimous. Then Uncle Leonard smiled and Lou frowned, and each went a different direction.
