SITUATION IN ENGLAND The liberal leaders in tnJiuid who favor home rule find in tho present threatening state of all urs in Ireland additional reasons for adhering tu Glad stones policy Tne Earl of Aberdeen at a meeting of Irishmen in Glasgow im pressed upon them the importance of preserving unshaken loyalty the Queen while they remained firm in their attach ment to homo rule John Morley evils attention to a division in the Tory ranks i lord Salisbury advoca ing coercive measures and Lord Randolph Churchill admitting that homo rule to a certain extent has become a nccessit while Gladstone keeps on the even tenor of his way tho wisdom of his well de fined policy being sustained by pissing events Morley appealed to tho seceding L berals to join with Gladstone and the Liberal party in freeing Ireland from the nightmare of confusion and Instruction In which she walked It is evident that Gla stones policy is gaining ground in connection with the sober second thought of conservative Englishmen and that it is but a question of time wlion it will be recognized as n necessity in the settle ment of tho Irish problem 

LIIES TRAGEDIES There are a few men and many women that have lived and ems living in this world who havo suffered and endured the agony of a hundred deaths through poverty and neglect without making a sign Tho bitterness of their experience in tho later years of their life has been Intensified by the pain fill contrast it fur nished to the bright and prosperous realities of early and middle life The Kansas City fines tells a harrow Ing story of the death by Htarv ition and nogltc of an old lady 70 years of ate She was the widow of Uonoral Jerome a brilliant Confodorato officer and the last jeaia of her life wore spent In the direst Poverty I She died last Thanksgiving night alone I h 00 on the upper floor of the tenement home No 111 Goerck street New York City and the next day her body was taken to tho morgue ami from thence to tho pot ters field for burial Sho was found dead on her miserable bed Everything In the ay of food had been exhausted A trifle of sugar a thimbleful of tea with I not a cent in her purse told the sad story of her death from starvation and a do spairing broken heart Surely there must hereafter be some compensation for tho sorrows of this mortal life especially for so lonely mid utterly miserable an existence as fell to the lot of this poor widow This life Is full of startling contrasts and veritable tragedies ALEXANDER IONG I One of the intenscl

Representatives On tho 8th of April ISO Mr Alexan I I I der I ong of Ohio rose In his place and closed a long speech as an antiwar I Democrat In these words I believe that there are but two alternatives and these aro either an acknowledgment of the South as an independent nation or their complete subjugation and oxtermi nation as a people i and of these alterna tives I prefer the former A very exciting debate followed this speech and a vote of censure was passed upon Long by a vote of 80 to 70 That was nearly twenty threo years ago Mr Long has dropped out of sight politically speaking and hardly anyone except his personal friends probably I knew whether ho was living or dead The Cleveland Plain Dealer however states that ho died In Cincinnati one week ago last night in tho 70th year of his ago Mr longs last appearance in public lifo was as a delegate from ono of the Cincinnati districts to the Democratic National Convention held In that city in 1880 An attack of valvular disease of the heart prostrated him March 1883 In September of the same year a stroke paralysis permanently disabled him and from this combination of disease ho has continual suffered until released by death Winter Davis Colfax Fernando Wood Iliad Stevens and Yoorhees leading participants in tho fiery debate that fol lowed longs speech preceded him to tho grave and tho hot blood of those
