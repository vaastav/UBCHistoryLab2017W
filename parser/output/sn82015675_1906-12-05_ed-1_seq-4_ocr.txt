RICHMOND, IND. NUMBER 30 1. Page Four. Begging tlie Qtxe&tiotx The Item continues to beg the question of a circulation show-down Try hedging behind its old fence, the Sun-Telegram. In its last evening's is sue the Item again repeats its proposition that a committee of Richmond merchants shall investigate its circulation, and states that such an inves tigation would take only thirty minutes. According to the Item a cir culation investigation consists simply of having the number of papers tak en out us paid for, balance with the amount shown on the cash book. In reality a circulation Investigation, to bo complete and accurate, must go much further. The number of papers taken out by the carrier boys must he checked up with the number of subscribers on their routes. Have the merchants" time enough to do this? Have they the time to spare to also Investigate the circulation of tho local papers in the same painstaking fashion in all the country towns. The Palladium is perfectly willing .to have a committee of merchants investigate its books to show what its paid circulation is, at any time they may wish to. But in doing this they will find that our circulation returns tally with our sworn paid circulation. If the merchants wish to be absolutely sure of the circulation of any paper, irrcspe -vivo of its sworn circulation statements, J.hey could not do better than to put the investigation into the hands of an experienced and trust worthy circulation auditor furnished by a responsible concern. We sug gested that such a man be obtained from Print f s Ink, a New York publi cation, for newspapers and advertisers, which conducts such investiga tions. We'agreed to pay the cost of an investigation by this concern of the Palladium. The Item, however late last night, claimed that we had made this proposition because we intended to bribe the investigator to up hold our figures. The Item in making this assertion, forgets that all newspaper managers do not necessarily have such a low sense of honor, as its manager has. In other words, as a famous King of England said, 'Evil to him who evil thinks.' However, if the merchants of this city should feel that a man fur nished by Printers' Ink would not be satisfactory we will suggest another concernand one which we feel sure the Item will not criticise. We have reference to an association maintained by the proprietory medicine manu facturers of the United States. , This association will furnish a circula tion auditor who conducts the investigation at the expense of the newspa per. This association, furthermore, is composed of firms whose total ad vertising bills annually run into the millions, and in pursuing a circulation investigation it acts in the interests of its members, who like to know whether they are paying for actual or fancied circulation. We would like to know whether the Item tomorrow night will dare question the integ rity of this association. In trying to get out of having a careful Investigation of its circula tion, the Item refuses to go In for such "a thing unless both the Sun-Telegram and the Palladium also go in, and declares that the Palladium owns the Sim-Telegram and can compel itto also undergo such an investigation. The Item knows very well that if the Sun-Telegram were controlled by the Palladium it would be compelled to submit to an investigation. Several months ago the Palladium and Item agreed to a circulation investigation providing the Sun-Telegram were included. The Sun-Telegram, accord ing to its custom, refused and the Item could not bib persuaded to go on with the Investigation of itself and the Palladium." It was afraid then and it is afraid now. If it isn't afraid it will be agreeable to an investi gation of its circulation by the asscciation representing the proprietary medicine manufacturers of this country. It won't keep dodging behind its old fence, the Sun-Telegram. The Item in trying to prove that the Palladium is keeping the Sun-Telegram from an investigation by virtue of ownership. In support of this contention the Item claims that Mr. Gold ing, circulation ruanagerof the Palladium, and Mr. Reller, city editor, are authority for it. Yet both these men deny absolutely the statement of the Item and brand it a lie. The Item goes on further to state that Payne & Young, our foreign advertising solicitors, in representing not only the Palladium, but also the Sun-Telegram, are soliciting business on a guarantee of thet.combined circulation of both papers at 8 cents per inch. The Item says it has documentary evidence that such a contract has been made, but we have one hundred dollars which will be donated to the Y. M. C. A. if the Item can produce proof of 'this. Really, the managing editor of the Item is rather hard up to be caught in so apparent a lie as this. The fact that Payne & Young represent the Palladium and Sun-Telegram doesn't mean that th interests of the two' papers are identical. The Palladium is in the morning field and the Sun-Telegram occupies the even ing field, neither conflicting with the other. - If tho Item dares show its. circulation it will be willing to undergo a rigid examination by the association we have named above. But whether or not tho Item consents, tho Palladium will provide for such an investiga tion of its circulation by that concern or any other concern acceptable to Richmond's merchants, and at its own expense- But we are willing to wager tho Item will again "hedge." ; 1 Publishers' Prfcss. 3 WashiL President Roosevelt made it apparent to sena torial callers that he is anxious for speedy action on the resolution call ing for information regarding the dis charge of negro soldiers cf the Twenty-fifth infantry for participating in the riot at Brownsville, Tex. As soon as a resolution is adopted, he told them, he will send the communication to the senate. He further stated that the Foraker resolution will be accept able to hini. President Roosevelt's message to congress occupied the attention of the senate as soon as the opening prelim inaries were concluded, which includ ed messages from the house citing the deaths of several members. The read ing of the message in both house and senate was given strict attention. Failed to Appear For Trial. Chicago, Dec. 4. N. C.
