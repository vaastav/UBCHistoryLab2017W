Fergus County Democrat. Vol II. No. 17. LEWISTOWN, FERGUS COUNTY, MONTANA, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1905. OFFICERS DISCOVER A CACHE OE THE STIIDINSKI PLUNDER JEWELRY, GIN AND SCABBARD Of THE MURDERED MAN EOUND UNDER THE BUILDING Of THE fERGUS COUNTY ARGUS WITH OTHER STOLEN GOODS. CHARLES R. BEBB ARRESTED. The second sensation connected with the now famous and mysterious Sam uel Studzinskl murder case was pro duced yesterday morning when it was announced on the streets that the watches, guns, cartridges and scab bards, which were stolen from the old man at the time of his death, had been found by the officers and thor oughly identified by the officers of the law. The goods were taken from be neath the floor of a back apartment of the Fergus County Argus building some time after midnight last night by Under Sheriff Ed Martin. H. R. Watson and Hal J. Akins were pres ent at the time the goods were taken from the cache. Together with the goods belonging to the murdered Jew were a miscel laneous assortment of dry goods, dress goods and shoes which Mr. Akins Identified as things taken from his store, the Golden Rule, when it was burglarized last May. The goods were discovered by acci dent about two weeks ago by Hal Del zer, lineman for the Lewistown-Bil lings Mutual Telephone company who had occasion to get in under the Ar gus building while putting in the wires for a telephone. He saw two suit cases, one of which w is partially open and upon looking into one of them found some dress skirts. He kept liis own counsel about the mat ter, telling only his roommate, Ollie Farmer, about the discovery. Sunday evening Farmer was in the Occidental saloon and while in a somewhat talkative mood, presumably superinduced by some of the liquor he had been indulging in, commenced to tell a friend of the discovery made by his roommate, Delzer. Under Sheriff Martin, who has been working on the case for several months, happened to hear a part of this conversation and at once started in to question Farmer. He later found Delzer who gave the whole thing away. Martin got H. R. Watson, business manager of the Ar gus, and Hal J. Akins, one of the proprietors of the Golden Rule, down town and together they went to the ■ rv. door So .to ir.ij room of the Ar gus and opened it up. The officer went down through the trap door and soon reappeared, bringing with him the two dress suit cases, taken from the Golden Rule, and a lot of more plunder taken from there and from Studzinski's place. For several weeks past, one or two slight circumstances has caused Offi OUR WONDERFUL MINES. Monnana Produces 40 Per Cent of the Cooper of the Entire World The annual report of William Walsh, state mine inspector, has been submitted to Governor Toole. The re port is a lengthy document, embrac ing 99 pages and fully covers all min ing operations carried on in the state during the year ending November 30. Many recommendations for the cor rection of existing evils are contained in the report. It is estimated that 15, 480 men are engaged in mining in the state. Speaking of copper mining, Mr. Walsh says: Of all the countries in the list of copper producers, the Unit ed States is the largest and during 1902 furnished 54.5 per cent of the world's supply. For the last eight years this country has furnished more than one-half of the supply and is likely to hold this foremost position indefinitely. Montana has produced 270,497,775 pounds of copper during the calendar year 1903, or more than 40 per cent of the total production of the United States. If the mines of Butte were to suspend operation for a single year, there would be a famine of the metal in the markets of the world. "The Butte district, containing the leading copper mines of Montana, is limited to an area of only about six or seven miles in length by four or five in width, but the veins often carry greater wealth, owing to their unusual dimensions, than those found in most districts. The total production in the cer Martin to suspect Charles R. Bebb, a printer, who has been in this place for a number of years, of the burglaries which were perpetrated in the city during the summer. For that reason, the officer, still accompanied by Messrs Watson and Akins, went to Bebb's house in the southern part of town and arrested the young man.He expressed much indignation but quiet ly accompanied the officer to the county jail. Once there he broke down and wept bitterly but die. not betray anything which would lead one to believe that he m : gnt be connected with the commission of a crime. He is charged with the erime of burglary, Hal J. Akins being the complaining witness. Bebb's friends are loath to believe that he is connected with either the burglary or the more serious crime with which some have thoughtlessly connected his name. He has always bore a good reputation for honesty since coming to this city several years ago and has been especially noted among his fellow craftsmen and the men for whom he has worked for his untiring industry. For four years be was employed as a compositor and for part of the time as foreman in the mechanical department of the Fergus County Argus. He voluntarily re signed that position on the 19th of August and on the 21st of that month, or the following Monday morning, took a responsible position as chic ad man and job printer on the Fergus County Ilemocrat. He voluntarily sur rendered his key to the business man ager of the Argus on the 19th four days before old man Studzinski was murdered and, so far as known, did not have any other key. That and oth er circumstances would indicate that he was, in no way connected with the Studzinski matter, and inasmuch as the burglar and the murderer are the same man or members of the same gang, it would appear that Bebb is not without substantial facts to prove his innocence of both crimes. Under Sheriff Ed Martin, who has been quietly but effectively working on the Studzinski case ever since the commission of the crime, is retiscent concerning the exact nature of the ev idnee but expresses confidence that the guilty person or persons will be in the toils before another week passes. The preliminary hearing of Bebb will probably be held within the next 24 hours and it is expected that many new circumstances will beT developed by that time. Butte district to the end of 1904, is placed at a valuation of about $600, 000 , 000 ." The mines of Butte are exhaustively treated, their past, the percentage of values, the outlook for the future and many matters pertaining to them. Considerable space is devoted to the question of securing good ventilation and sanitation for mines, and sugges tions are made as to how these results can be obtained. In speaking of this matter, Mr. Walsh says: "The quantity of explosives used in Montana is much above the average mining districts and the gasses from the combustion of these explosives are so intense as to actually become pois onous if good fresh air currents are not maintained. Taking the mines visited, as a whole, the ventilation of the deeper levels, cannot be said to be satisfactory, though these portions of the mines along the main air currents are fairly supplied. Appliances for regulating air currents, such as the use of doors and stopings in systema tizing the ventilation of metalliferous mines has not had the attention which its importance deserves, the currents being generally allowed to travel hap hazard." In some of the mines unsanitary conditions exist. "In most of the large mines," says Mr. Walsh, "it has been found that the sanitary condi tions were anything but satisfactory and a number of them are positively injurious to the health of the miners. In speaking of the accidents that oc cur in mines, Mr. Walsh says it is the duty of the miner to protect himself, but that many times this is not done, because of the desire of the stock holder to receive dividends and these are not forthcoming he make complaint, and retrenchment follows He says: "It has been one of the main ambi tions of the incumbent of this office to see to it very carefully that all provis ions of the law tending to the preser vation of life and health are rigidly observed and in this regard there shall be no laxity." The report shows that there were 89 accidents during the year in mines Forty-eight were fatal and 41 non-fat ai. Causes of the fatal accidents were as follows: Explosions of blasting compounds, 15; fall of rockk or ground, 9; caught by cages in shafts, 10: falling down ore chutes, 5; falling down manways, 2; suffocated by gases or foul air, 1; breaking of cables, 3; struck by fall ing drills, 3. A summary set forth the following facts: "Mines inspected, 186; men employ ed, 14,680; fatal accidents, 48; fatal ac cldents to each 1,000 men employed, 3.2; non-fatal accidents, 41; non-fatal accidents to each 1,000 employed, 2.8.' The rest of the report is devoted to a statement of the mining that is being done in the counties of the state, all the mines being enumerated and brief description given of each. OLD EREIGHTER SERIOUSLY HURT Albert Hutchison Tell Erom a Load of Hay Near Town ot Kendall and May Die As Result. CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN Load Was Overturned and the Driver Was Thrown, His Head Striking Some Ice. Albert Hutchinson, who is well known among the business men of Lewistown, met with a serious and perhaps fatal accident last Thursday afternoon while driving into Kendall with a load of hay. The account given by the Kendall Miner is as fol lows: Albert Hutchinson, one of the old time freighters of Fergus county, lying in a room in the Shaules hotel suffering from a critical and perhaps fatal injury, sustained yesterday af ternoon about 3 o'clock as a result of falling rom a load of hay which he was hauling into this city for W. A. Shaules. He is still in a partially un conscious state and while his condi tion is somewhat more hopeful than during the night, he is still in very grave danger. Hutchinson was bringing a big load of hay, the load being roped to the wagon, . He evidently tried to turn out of the road just at the foot of Sand hill, about 400 yards below town. The road is very unevefc at that point and the load overturned, throwing the driver about 15 feet. He struck direct ly on his head on an icy place on the side of the hill and was rendered un conscious. The team broke loose and ran up town, that being the first that anyone knew of the accident. Dr. Gaylord McCoy and W. A. Shaules hurried down the road and found Hutchinson lying on the side of the road and bleeding profusely from the nose, mouth and ears. He was taken to the Shaules hotel and an examina tion showed that he had unquestion ably suffered a concussion of the brain. Hutchinson is a man of over 50 years of age and, so far as known, has no relatives in this part of the country. He has followed the busi ness of freighting and teaming since a time when the memory of man run neth not to the contrary and has many friends, particularly among the old timers, who hope to see him re cover from the terrible injury from which he is now suffering. The last accounts from Kendall are that "Hutch" is still unconscious and the chances for his recovery are not considered good. First Discovery of Tin. The first discovery of tin in Mon tana was recently made in the Baldy range of the Little Belt mountains, about eighteen miles from Monarch and about seven from Neihart. The credit for the discovery is claimed by Prof. O. C. Mortson and C. A. Martin of Monarch. Prof. Mortson in an Interview says that they have 12 feet of mica and that they are down from 15 to 16 feet on the vein. Prof. Mortson exhibited about 30 pounds of specimens to his friends in Great Falls. These showed much mica and also tin and he will send them to eastern cities for expert reports. Will Baffle Burglars. There will be no show for burglars around the First State bank when their new Bayonet Joint Manganese safe is placed within their brick and masonry vault. This safe is a model of ingenuity and and is claimed to be burglar proof against any and all known methods of attack. It is im possible to gain entrance to the safe with either nltro-glycerln or dynamite even under the most favorable con ditions. The lest of this safe, or rather one of the same manufacture, was made by experts recently and although 12 shots containing 64 ounces of nitro glycerin were exploded, covering a period from nine o'clock In the morn ing until four o'clock in the afternoon, COMMISSIONERS LET CONTRACTS William Medigar Retains His Posit ion As Guardian of the County Poor Farm. COMFORT FOR COUNTY INMATES Heating Plant and Other Improve ments Made in the County Farm Coal Contract Let. The county commissioners will close one of the busiest sessions they ever held this afternoon. This being the last meeting of the year, all of the different contracts were let. William Medigar once more secured the con tract for taking care of the county poor, his bid being $5.50 per week per inmate. The commissioners also ord ered about $3,000 worth of work paid for, the improvements having been made on the county poor house and consisting of a heating plant plumb ing, water works, sewer, etc. The countv poor farm or hospital, as It is generally called, is now one of the most comfortable places in the county to reside in. The Montana Coal company was awarded the coal contract, their bit being $3.95 yer ton for all coal to b furnished as ordered by the county commissioners. ^ The Fergus County Agricultural Stock and Mineral association was given $1,000, the same as was given last year for the purpose of paying premiums for the best disylays at tli ounty fair. Synopsis of President's Message. Washington, Dec. 5.—The reading of President's Roosevelt's message began before the senate and house a little after noon today'. The reading of the document consumed over three hours. The document is the most compre hensive message President Roosevelt has ever submitted to congress. It overs a large variety of subjects, in ternal and external, and pays particu lar attention to the subject of railroad ate legislation and federal supervis ion of corporations, the most prominent feature of the message. The president has pointed out in great detail the evils now exist ing and the necessity for their eradi cation. As a remedy he proposes that the interstate commerce commission hall be authorized in declaring a rate unreasonable to declare at the same me what is a maximum, reasonable ate, and to make an order requiring the offending railroad to reduce its ates to that maximum. He further recommends that in or der to insure obedience to the order, the law contain a penalty, but that opportunity be reserved to the com to appeal to the federal court, bates in any form shall be impossible. The president also seeks the regula ion of the private car and terminal nterests so that descrimination or re bates in any form shal be impossible. The president speaks in a forceful manner on the subject of insurance, referring to the revelations made dur ing the inquiry made in New York as evidence of the great need of federal supervision. 3 he president wants laws which will prevent the United States from serv ing as a dumping ground for Europe. 

EATAL WRECK ON MONTANA R. R. NEAR UBET YESTERDAY MORNING ENGINE NO. 103 TURNS OVER ONE MILE EAST OF UBET. FIREMAN CHARLES SHUBERT CRUSHED TO DEATH AND ENGINEER SHULL INJURED. NO PASSENGERS HURT. The first fatal wreck on the Mon tana railroad occurred yesterday morning at 9 o'clock at the "shoe fly," one mile this side of Ubet station. Foreman Charles Shuhert was thrown under the engine and his life was crushed out almost instantly. Engi neer Ole Shull was hurt hut not suffi cient to prevent him from continuing on the trip. One mile this side of Ubet in a long ut which lias caused the road so much difficulty in snowy times by fill ing with snow and making it practi cally impossible for a train to force its way through. In order to prevent any delays from this source, the (pad has built a track around the cut. This track or "shoe fly" as it is called, has been used since the recent storm filled the cut with snow. The train which left here yesterday morning in charge if Conductor Miller and a crew com prising Engineer Shull, Fireman Shu bert and Brakemen MeGlrl and Lew ellin, started to leave tin* regular track for the new track and the rails vidcntly slipped as the engine toppl d over, taking with it one box car. It was so sudden that neither the en gineer or fh email had an opportun ity to jump, and as a result, the tire man was caught directly under the big engine (It was No. 103, the 100,000 At the same time he wants fair deal ing with all nations, and has devoted considerable space to the question of the amendment to the Chinese ex clusion law. The president favors continued ex clusion of the laboring classes of the Chinese. He opposes the exclusion of the intelligent class. He wants the merchant, the banker, artist, student and such classes of Chinamen to have a right to enter the United States un der exnctlv the same terms and con ditions as If they were born in Europe or any other part of the world. He wants them relieved from unnecessary and harsh examination, and purticu larly of any measure savoring of deg radation. He is much in earnest in this connection, and has called atten tion to the boycott against American goods in China as the beginning of what may develop into a serious situ ation, involving all American inter ests in the empire. The president refers to the happy result of the negotiations which oc curred at Portsmouth between Russia and Japan. There is a modest refer ence to the part the United States played in bringing the belligerents to gether and in aiding them to reach an agreement. The president regards the internal situation in Russia as deplor able, but sees in the new era which has been inaugurated promise of the Improvement of all classes and the re moval of the serious restrictions un der which the Jews have labored. The president describes at length the reasons for his action putting into operation the modus vivendl under which the United States is collecting the customs of Santo Domingo with out sanction of congress. He has toid of the satisfactory results which fol lowed from the modus vivendi, includ ing the peaceful administration of the island and of depositing a large sum in New York with which to discharge the foreign debt of the Dominican government. He recommends urgently the ratification of the treaty pending before the senate by which the United States is authorized to collect the cus toms. Tlie conditions in the insular pos sessions—the Philippines and Porto Rico—are not as reassuring as they were when congress met last year, and the president discusses the so iled Insular question with that frankness which he applies to all questions. Congress is asked to take vigorous steps to enable the United States to participate in the new markets to be opened up in the far east. President Roosevelt believes that a special com mission should be authorized to study the entire subject of oriental trade. Congress has repeatedly Ignored rec ommendations of this character, but it is believed that recent developments have aroused the whole world to the situation to such an extent that the matter cannot longer be Ignored. pounder, Just purchased a few weeks ago) and crushed to death. Shull, the engineer, was considerably battered up but his Injuries are of a minor na ture and ho wilt soon be all right again. None of the passengers were injured In the least as the passenger earn were left standing on the track. A wreck train came from down the road and commenced to clean up the debris. They got the track clear last night about 8:30 o'clock and the train com ing this way gqt through. The pas sengers were held at the place of ihe wreck until the track was opened up ami continued their Journey last night. The amount of Injury done to the engine cannot be ascertained until it is more carefully gone over but It is believed that it can soon be fixed up as good ns new. The body of Charles Shuhert, the lineman who was killed, was brought to this city last night and the inquest will be held today and tomorrow by Coroner Attix and a jury which he has already summoned. Shuhert was 22 years of age and has been on the Montana railroad about two months, having previously held a position as fireman on the Northern Pacific. He lias relatives living in Livingston. Tin* funeral arrangements have not yet been definitely made. The president is gratified at the sub stantial Increases which have been made In the navy and believes tho work should not stop. He refers tft the lessons of the Russo-Japanese war as vindicating the battleship and con curs In the recommendations of tho general hoard of the navy that three new battleships he authorized. The president believes that the United States should not be behind other na tions which are now building 1,80000 ton battleships in the belief that the larger type Is to dominate In future naval actions. Other subjects receiving more or less attention in the president's mes sage are The Hague peace conference. Venezuela, service pensions for Gruno Army veterans, public land preserva tion, economy in postal service, re funding national indebtedness and ex panding the currency, a delegate for Alaska, territorial admission and va rious matters in regard to the coun try's foreign relations. Sources of Increase. The principal sources of the great in crease In the gold production of over $8,000,000 compared with that of 1903 are easily traceable, says the Denver Mining Reporter. Colorado added $2, 000,000 to her production of 1903, most of this coming from the mines of Cripple Creek. Nevada's output in creased about the same amount, chief ly by the reason of the prenomina! yields of the Goldfield mines. The greatest progress is reported in California, whose production exceeds that of 1903 by $2,300,000, the increase being caused partly by a strong de velopment of the quartz mining and to a less degree by the astlvlty of dredges. Alaska and Arizona show increased yields amounting, respectively, to $476,893 and $748,708. A number of states show smaller increase, while Utah, Montana and Washington have less gold to their credit for 1904 than in 1903.
