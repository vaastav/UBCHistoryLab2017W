O.?"When Chester E.

Two days before he is said to have confessed to former Senator Mills, his counsel, that he had struck the girl In the water, that."Billy" Brown rose to the surface once after she went over board and that the man for whom she had sacrificed honor and faith and beauty leaned over the side of the boat and dealt her a htow-which stilled her forever. The report says that Mills entered | Gillette's cell last week and informed | the prisoner tliut lie would have to j take the witness stand in Ills own de- \ fense.

(t. - Without . debate the senate adopted a resolution calling on the secretary of commerce and labor to furnish the senate copies I of all official letters, telegrams, re ports, etc.. tiled in the department in 1 connection with the investigation of the matter of the Japanese attending the public schools of San Francisco. ' The resolution was presented by Sena tor Fltoit (Cat). ? The president confidently expects to i be able to settle the troublesome prob lem that has arisen because of the dis crimination against Japdnese in the schools of San Francisco. Neither he nor any other member of the adminis- ' tration lias the remotest idea that there will be war or ecfn a breucli of the friendly relations between Japan and' this country. The California delegation in congress has rbcelved what they consider satis- ' factory assurance that tjie president did ilot desire to be understood as say ing In the Japanese section of bis lues- ' sage that be would use tlie military force of the United States in forcing Japanese Into the California schools In which white children are taught. It is said to have been his purpose to convey the Idea that lie would use the military to protect Japanese against mob violence. Califoruiaus take 110 of, t'ense at tbls Interpretation of the mes sage and agree that the chief executive j should do everything In his power to protect Japanese as well as all other j , foreigners against violence. "This whole San Francisco affair is , proving to lie a tempest In a teapot." i Representative Julius Kalin said. "It j, will die out rapidly us so m as there Is ( a general understanding as to why California takes the position It does, "The courts and not the public must settle all the legal questions involved j ( hi the Sau Fruueiseo school situation." j . 'That the president's views on the! subject meet with tho hearty approval ' of the Japanese government was made evident when Viscount Aoki, the Japa nese ambassador, yesterday personally thanked the president for what be had j 1 said in Ills message regarding the i vexed question. I'ostmnstei General (leoige R, Oor tolyou will be confirmed as secretary j of the treasury within,a few days, as .there is no disposition on the part of , the senate to refure b'.ni en1"::iation. j DO YOU ntJY

WASHINGTON, Doc. 6.?President Roosevelt's expression recently of bis vigorous views uguinst the discrimina tion shown by the managers of some I heaters and other places of amuse ment against the uniform of Hie Unit ed States army and navy, particularly the latter und against the men who wear that uniform, already is bearing substantial fruit. That members of the theatrical pro Cession do not sympathize with the at titude of some amusement managers on this subject is evidenced by the fol lowing letter received by Secretary of the Navy Bonaparte from S. Good friend, manager of the Columbia thea ter, Washington, the publication of which inytuthorized: "Mr. Secretary?I have the honor on liehalf of Idgb.v Bell and his manager, Daniel V.
