Bis Brains, At Napoleon Bonaparte's post-mor tem examination at St. Helena, it was found that the head that had imposed ita will upon nearly the whole of Europe contained 52%oz of brain. This i:i a somewhat unusual quantity. A great financier died not long since ift the United States who was a re markably intelligent and strong-willed man. He had risen from the bottom of the ladder to great wealth and in fluence. His brain was of exactly the mime weight. But here is a curious case. An idiot's brain was once carefully weighed at the London College of Physicians, and it was actually ascertained to weigh 63 oz. Giants are almost always of feeble intellect, although their brains often weigh heavy, while many persons of diminutive size possess undoubted genius. lt follows that in meregrowth —i. e., increase of size—and develop ment—i. e., increase in elaborateness and complexity—there is a certain antagonism. The former is at the ex pense of the latter. What makes all the difference is not-merely the quan tity. but the quality of the'brain. Girl a' White Ilnga.

Mise Collins, a Maine girl who has been out among the Dakotas as a miss onary, says the way to civilize the Indians is liy nutses rather than by preachers and 'teachers. Instruc tions in the care of the sick, the nat ure of diseasn and the proper use of m:dicine releases thein from the influence of the "medicine man." It is these who, working on the supersti tious minds of the Indians, are the greatest obstacles to their civilization. The Indians have been peculiarly sus ceptible to epidemic diseases, which have created greater ravages than war and priyation combind. Miss Collins instances nil epidemic of meas les in which cleanliness and nursing saved every life that of a child whoso grandmother was a medicine woman.

A few months ago a Philadelphia street car companies began running smoking cars in response to a popular demand for them, says the New York Evening Post. It lias been foiMd al most impossible to keep women out of these cars, and to make matters worse the smokers,unable to resist the claims of politeness, -liave been cheerfully sur rendering their seats to- the women. Tilings have now got to such a pass that the latter have become musters of the situation. "Day by day," says an observer, "the feminine travel upon the smoking car has increased. That man is lucky who can now cling to the edges of the car and fondly hope that he may smoke in peace, after the long journey is over and he has reached the secluded precincts of Ills office or home. The •women not only claim the smoking cars as their own, but they have begun to stare coklly at such men as now ven ture timidly into the ears, which were prepared especially for them." The question whether the men have a right to smoke in a smoking car 111 the pres ence of women lias been settled by the latter in the negative, and an offender •was actually ejected from one of these cars the other day by a man accom panying an indignant woman. What makes the persistence of the women singular is that that the smoking cars are much less comfortable and attrac tive than those provided for general use. The Philadelphia newspapers are courageously supporting the men in this emergency, and urging them to stand on their rights. "The women," one newspaper makes bold to say, "must yield the' cars to men or they (the women) must learn to smoke." Deafness Can Mot Be Cared by local applications, as they can not reach the diseased portion of the ear. There i» only one way to cure Deafness and that is by constitutional remedies. Deafness is caused by an inflamed condition of the mucous lining of the Eustachian Tube. When this tube gets inflamed you have rumbling sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is entirely closed Deafness is the result, and unless the inflammation can be taken out and this tube restored to its nor mal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever nine cases out of ten are caused by catarrh, which is nothing but an in flamed condition of the mucous surfaces.

One an Iriali Pollceimin and Anotber Stnare Supernumerary, It has been discovered that among the men of the Royal Irish Constabu lary there is a baronet A writer in tlie World of this week gives his name. It is Sir Thomas Echlin, the seventh baronet of tlie name. Even lie, how ever, low as his fortunes seem to have fallen, is better off than his uncle, Sir Frederick Echlin, the fifth baronet or (lis fathefr, the sixth baronet. The former was a pauper in receipt of pa rochial relief at Edenkerry, in Ivildare, until he -was granted a email pension from the Greatham Hospital at Stock ton-on-Tees while the latter was a su perannuated peasant, living at Kilmea gue, in the same county, who was sup ported by contributions from his three sons, the present baronet and his two brothers, the elder a private in the Life Guards and the younger formerly a footman and now a stationmaster. The Echlins number a prelate and a judge of more than ordinary eminence among their direct ancestors, and their baronetcy dates from the reign of George I.

Offer to Mediate. Actlug under a stipulation In our treaty with Corea (the tlrst concluded with a West ern power), I felt constrained at the begin ning of the controversy to teuder our good offices to induce an amicable arrangement of the luitial difficulty growing out of the Japanese demands for administrative re forms in Corea but the unhappy precipita tion of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the Eastern nntioe-j, and anxious that our com mercial interests in those countries may be preserved, aud that the safety of our citi zens there shall not be jeopardized, 1 would not hesitate to heed any intitnaticm that our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belligerents. The Bering: Sea Agreement. Early in the present year an agreement was reached with Great Britain concerning instructions to be given to the naval com manders of tlie two governments in Uer» ing sea and the contiguous North Pacific ocean for their guidance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbi tration and the enforcement of the regula tions therein prescribed, for the protection of seal life in the waters mentioned. An understanding lias also been reached for the payment by the United States of $425, 000 in full satisfaction of all claims which may be made by (Jrent liritain for damages growing out of the controversy as to fur seals in Bering or the seizure of British vessels engaged in talcing seals in these waters. The awards and findings of tlie Paris tribunal to a 'great extent deter mined the facts and principles upon which ttese claims should be adjusted and they have been submitted by both governments to thorough examination upon the princi ples, as well as the facts which they in volved. I am convinced that a settlement upon the terms mentioned would be an equitable and advantageous one, and I lecommend that provision be made for the prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus far only France and Portugal have signified their willingness to adhere to the regula tions established under the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration. Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a pre paratory examination of the question of protection of food fish in the contiguous waters of the United States and the Domin ion of Canada are in progress. Regnrding Hawaii. Since communicating the voluminous cor respondence in regard to Hawaii and the action taken by the senate and house rep resentatives on certain questions submitted to the judgment and wider discretion of congress, the organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen has been announced with evidence of its effective operation. Tlie recognition usual in such cases has been accorded the new government. The Bluellelcls' Incident. Prominent among the questions of th* rear was the Bluefields' incident in what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bor dering on the Atlantic ocean and within the Jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of 1860 between Great Britain and Nicaragua the-former government expressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter over the strip ancl a limited form of self-government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers within its limits. The so called native government which grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed tbe right to maintain a praeiieuly independent government. Early in Hie ps.st year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito territiry led to serious dis turbances culminating in the suppression of the native government aua the attempted substitution of an impracticable composite administration in Nicaragut and alien resi dents were to participate. Failure was fol lowed by an insurrection which for a time subverted Nicaraguan rule, expelling her of ficers and restoring the old organization. This in turn gave place to the existing local government established and upheld by Nic? aragua. For some months on and during' part of the time two of our naval a*'ips h^'e been stationed at Bluefields, for the protection of all legitimate interests of our citlzenst In Septomber last the government at Man uaga expeiled from its territory twelve or more foreigners, including two Americans, for alleged participation In the sedition or revolutionary movements against the repub lic at Bluefields already mentioned but through the earnest remonstrance of this government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful manage ment of their business. Our naval com* manders at the scene of these disturbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment contributed largely to the prevention of more serious consequences and to the restoration of peace and order. I e gret that in the midst of these occurrences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of Nicaragua justice. An American citizen uamed Wilson residing at Raamk Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Argueleo, the acting governor of the town. After some delay the murderer was ar ested, but so insecurely confined or guarded that he escaped and notwithstanding ou repeated demands it is claimed that his re capture has been Impossible by reason of his fight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction. The Ntcaraguan authorities having given notice of forfeiture of their concession to the canal company on grounds purely tech nical and not embraced In the contract have receded from that position. A« to Samoa. In my last annual message I referred briefly tQ the uusatisfactory state of affairs In Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty as slgnnlly illustrating the policy of entangling alliances with foreign powers, and on May 9th, 181)4, in response to a reso lution of the senate, sent a special message fmd documents to that body on the same subject, which emphasized my previouslj expressed opinions. Jvatcr occurrences, tl£ correspondence in regard to which will be laid before congress, further demonstrate that the government which was devised by the three powers and forced upon the Sa» moans against their inveterate hostility can be maintained only by the contluued pres ence of foreign military force at no small sacrifice of life tyid treasure.

TilK AIUIV. Some Chniiurea Are Considered Very DoMirnhlo. From the report of the secret a OLNEY'S DEPARTMENT. The Circuit Court of Appeal** Proven a SucceiM. The report of the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the su preme court In overcoming the arrears of its business and in reachiug a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is, of course, very largely due to thi successful working of the plan inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In respect to these tribunals the suggestion is made, in quarters entitled to the highest consideration, that an additional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the conlldence reposed in their adjudications, and that such an addition would not create a greater force of judges than the increasing business of such courts requires. I commend the suggestion to the careful consideration of congress. Other important topics are ad •verted to in the report accompanied by recommendations, many of which have been treated at large in previous messages and ut this time therefore need only be named. I refer to the abolition of the fee sys tem ns a measure of compensation to federal officers the enlargement of the powers of United States commissioners at least in the territories, the allowance of writs of error In criminal cases on behalf of the United States and the establishing of de grees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the attorney general of much Im portance it the condition of the administra tion of justice in tlie Indian territory. The permanent solution of what Is called the Indian problem Is probably not to be ex pected at once, but meanwhile such amelior ations of present conditions as the system •will admit of. ought not to be neglected. I am satisfied there should be a federal court established for the territory, with suf ficient judges, and that tills court should sit within the territory and should have jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as now vested in the federal courts silting in Ar kansas and Texas. 

POSTOFFICE AFFAIRS Change in Second-Class* Rates Is Recommended. The report of the postmaster general pre sents a comprehensive statement of the operations of tbe postofllce department for the last fiscal year. The receipts of the department during the year amounted to $75,080,479.04 and the expeadltures $84,324, 414.15. Tbs transactions of the postat service secretary rat IT of wa it. appears that the strength of the arm on Sept. 30, 1894, was 2.135 officers an 25,705 enlisted men. Although this Is a] parontly a very slight decrease compare with the previous year, the actual effect!v. force has been increased to the equivalent of nearly two regiments through the re organization of the system of recruiting and the consequent release to regimental duty of the large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The abol ition of these depots, it is predicted, will furthermore effect an annual reduction nn proxlmating $250,000 in tlie direct expendi tures. besides promoting generally the health, morals and discipline of tlie troops. 'Iiicrcnae lt» Strength In­ dicate *Uh barometric certainty tbe fluctua tions in tbe business of the country. Inas much, therefore, as business complications continue to exist throughout the last year to the unforseen extent, it is not surprising that the deficiency of revenue to meet the expenditures of the postoffice department, which was estimated in advance at about eight million dollars, should be exceedod by nearly oue and one quarter million dollars. The ascertained revenues of the last year, which were the basis of calculation for the current year, being less thar» estimated, the deficiency for the current year will be cor respondingly greater, though the postmaster general states that the latest Indications are so favorable that he confidently pre dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent in the revenues of the current year over thoso of the last year. Tho expenditures increaso steadily and necessarily with tho growth and needs of the country, so that the deficiency is greater or less In any yeur depending upon the volume of receipts. The postmaster general renews the sug gestion made In a previous report that the department organization be increased to the extent of creating a direct district super vision of all iostal affairs, and in this suggestion I fully concur. There are now connected with the post office establishment 32,661 employes who are in the classified service. This includes many who have been classified upon the suggestion of the postmaster-general, llo states that another year's experience at the head ot the department serves ouly to strengthen the conviction as to the excellent worklug of tbe civil service law In this branch of the public service.

If we are to have a navy for warlike operations, offensive and defensive, we certainly ought to increase both the number of battle-ships and tor pedo boats. 

HOKE SMITH'S 1VOHK. Recommendations Kefltardlnff Pablle Landfi, Pension* and Patents. The report of the secretary of the in* terior exhibits the situation of tbe numer* ous and interesting branches of tbe public service connected with his department. I commend this report mid the valuable rec ommendations of the secretary to the care ful attention of the congress. The public land disposed of during the year amounts to 10,406,100.77 acres, includ ing 28,876,05 of Indian lands. It Is estimat ed that the public domain still remaining amounts to a little more than 600,000,000 acres excluding, however, about 360,000,000 acres In Alaska as well as military reserva tions and railroad and other selections of lands yet unadjudlcated. The Indian Problem. Though the coudition of the Indians sho.ws a steady aud healthy progress, their situa tion is not satisfactory at all points. Home of them to whom allotments of land hsve been made are found to be unable or dis inclined to follow agricultural pursuits or otherwise beneticially manage their land. j...H Is especially true of the Cheyeunes and Arapalioes, who, as It appears by reports of their agents, have in many lustances never been located upon their allotments, and In some cases do not even know where their allotments are. Their couditlou has deteriorated. They uire not self-supporting and they live in camps aud spend their times In idleness. Pensions. At the close of the last fiscal year, on the 30th day of June, 1894, there were 969,544 persons ou our pension rolls, being a net increase of 3,532 over the number reported at the end of the previous year. These pen sioners may be classed as follows: Soldiers and sailor, survivors of all wars, 753,968 widows and relatives of deceased soldiers, 115,162 army nurses in the war of the re- AVhlln the maximum le«al strength of the I be"'?11,. these penslonere, 32,039 ure army Is 25,000 men, the otToctive stongth. surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars for various causes, is but little over 207000 *,rl?r t? .V® rriwi ~t ,i„ '_Tl and relatives of such soldiers. men. The purpose of congress does not therefore seem to be fully attained by tlie existing coudition. While no considerable increase in the army is in my judgment demanded by rccent events, the policy of sea coast fortification, in the prosecution of which we have been steadily engaged for some years, has so far developed as to sug gest that the effective strength of the army be now made at least equal to the legal strength. Measures taken by the depart ment during the year as indicated have al ready considerably augmented the effective force, and the secretary of war presents a plan which I recommend to the consideration of congress to attain tlie desired end. Econ omies effected in the department In other linos of its work will offset to a great extent tho expenditure involved In the proposition submitted. Among other things this con templates the adoption of the three bat tallion formation of regiments which for several years has been Indorsed by the sec retaries of war and the generals commanding the army. Compact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization ready to be filled out In the event of war which is peculiarly adapted to our strength and requirements and the fact that every nation, with a single exception, has adopted this formation to meet the condition of modern warfare should alone secure for the recommendation an early consideration. The Hecent Strike. It is hardly neccessary to recall the fact that in obedience to the commands of the constitution and the laws and for the pur pose of protecting the property of the United States, aiding the process of federal courts and removing lawless obstructions to the performance by the government #f its legitimate functions it became necessary in various localities during lh». year to em ploy a considerable portion of the regular troops. Tho duty was discharged promptly, courageously and with marked discretion by the officers and men, and the most gratify ing proof was thus afforded that the army deserves that complete confidence in its efficiency and discipline which the country has at all times manifested. llll.° clv," and the widow* and relatives of such soldiers.

The secretary of agriculture In his report reviews the operations of his department for the last lU-al year, am nakes recom mendations for the further extensions of it* usefulness. He reports a saving in expendi tures during the year of $000,000, which la covered back into tlie treasury. This sum Is 23 per cent of the entire appropriation. A special study has been made of the de mand for American farm products In all foreign markets, especially Great Britain. That country received from the United States during the nine mouths eliding Sept. 30, 1804, 305,010 live beef cattle, valued at $20,r00,000, as against 182,011 cattle valued at .fill,032.000 during the same period for 1803. During the first six months of 1804 the United Kingdom took 112,000,000 poundg of dressed beef from the United States, valued nt nearly $10,000,000. Tlie report shows that during the nine months immediately preceding Sept. 30, 1804, the United States exported to Great Britain 22,G7C.O)0 pounds of :ork of apples 1,000,000, valued at $2,500,000. and of horses 2,S11, at an average of $139 per head. There was a fulling off In American wheat exports of 13,.r00,000 bushels, and the sec retary Is inclined to believe that wheat may not, in the future, be the staple export cereal product of our country, but that corn will continue to advance In Importance as an export on account of tho uses to which It Is constantly being appropriated. The export of agricultural products from the United Stales during the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1S94, amounted to $028,303,038, being 72.28 per cent ot American exports of every description, anil the United Kingdom of Great Britain took more than S4 per cent of all farm products finding foreign markets. civil. SERVICE. The President I'leaaed With the H«. form—Public Health und Labor. The advantage to the public service of an adherence to the principles of civil serv ice reform are constantly more apparent and nothing 1B so encouraging to those In official life who honestly desire good gov ernment as the Increasing appreciation by our people of these advantages. A vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to insist that the time and attention of those they select to perform for them tho more Important public duties should not be distracted by dealing out minor offices, and they are growing to be unanimous In regarding party organization as something that should be used In establishing party principles Instead of dictating the distribu tion of public places as rewards of parti san activity. Numerous additional offices and places have lately been brought within civil service rules and regulations, and some others will Sle robably soon be Included. Tbe report of commissioners will be submitted to the congress and I Invite careful attenttoa to the recommendations it contains. The Labor Commlmioa, By virtue of a statute of the United State* passed in 1888, I nnoolutcd in July laal Hon. John I). Kernan, of the State of New York, and lion. Nicholas E. Wortlilngton, of the State of Illinois, to form with Hon. Carroll D. Wright, commissioner of labor, who was designated by said statute, a com mission for tlie purpose of making careful inquiry Into tlie causes of the controversies between certain railroads and their employes which have resulted ill an extensive and destructive strike, accompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance with considerable loss of life aud great destruc tion of property. The report of the commissioners has been submitted to me and will be transmitted to congress' with the evidence taken upon their Investigation. Their work has been well done anil their standing and intelligence give assurance that tbe report and sugges tions they make are worthy of careful con sideration. THE 

TARIFF. The President Considers the Hatter Not Yet Settled. The tariff act passed at the last session of the congress needs important amendments if it is to be executed effectively and with certainty. In addition to such necessary amendments as will change rates of duty, I am still very decidedly In favor of put ting coal and Iron upon the free list. So far as the sugar schedule is concerned, I would be glad under existing aggravations to see every particle of differential duty In fayor of refined Bugar stricken out of our tariff law. If with all the favor now ac corded the sugar roflnlug Interest in our tariff laws It still languishes to the ex tent. of closing refineries and discharging thousands of workmen It would seem to fslatlve iresent a hopeless case for reasonable leg aid. Whatever else is done or omitted I earnest ly repeat tbe recommendation made in an other portion of this communication thnt the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent per pound laid upon sugar imported from countries paying a bounty on Its export be abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly Important considerations point to tbe pro priety of this amendment.

During the last month the gold reserved in the treasury for the purpose of redeem ing the notes of the government circulating now in the hands of tbe people became (o reduced, and Its further depletion in the near future seemed so certain that in tbe exercise of proper care for the public wel fare It became necessary to replenish the reservo and thus .maintain sepular Xdtb.Ul tie afillTTy s&fl' dfciermfBaflSir or WC~oT ernment to meet, as agreed, its pecuniary obligations.

NEW CUHKKNCY HCIIKMK. A Plitn Sogseiiteil by Ncrrrtar.v Car lisle IN KndorMtMl. Questions rehulug to our hanks ami cur rency are closely eonneeted with the sub ject Just referred to ami they also prcHent Bome uiiHatiKfa'tory features. J'romluent among them are the laek of elasticity In our currency circulation and Its frequent con centration in liuancial centers when It Is niORt needed in other parts of the country. The absolute divorcement of the govern ment from the business of banking Is the Ideal relationship of the government to the circulation of the currency of the country. This condition cannot. immediately reached, but ns a step lu that direction and ns a means of securing a mor elastic cur rency and obviating other objections to tho present arrangement of bank rlmilntlon, tho secretary of tlie treasury presents In his re port a scheme modifying present bank laws and providing for the Issue of circulating notes by state hanks free from taxation un der certain limitations. It Is projiosed to repeal all laws providing for tlie deposit, uf United States bonds ns security for circulation: to permit uutlonul bunks to Issue circulating notes not exceed ing in amount Tfi per cent of their paid up and unimpaired capital, provided tliey de posit with tlie government as a guarantee fund In the United Suites

In addition to the guarantee fund re quired, II Is proposed to provide a safety fund for the Immediate redemption of the circulating notes of failed banks liy Impos ing a small annual tux, sny one-half of 1 per cent, unon the avcrac- circulation of each bank until the fund amounts to 5 per cent of the total circulation outstanding. When bank falls Its guarantee fund Is to be paid '-to this safety fund and Its notes are to 'O redeemed in the first In stance from such safety fund thus aug mented—any Impairment of such fund caused thereby to bo maoe good from tlie Immediately available cash assets of said bank, and If these should be Insufficient such impairment to be made good by pro rata assessments among the other lianks their contributions consisting a first lien upon the assets of failed bank In favor of the contrl'-ntinir bank*. As Fnrtlirr Security. As a further security It Is contemplated that the existing provision fixing the Indiv idual liability of stockholders 1h to be re tained anil the banks' Indebtedness ou ac count of Its circulating notes Is to be made a first lien 011 all Its assets. For the purnose of meeting tlie expense of printing notes, oftlcinl supervision, cancella tion and other like charges there shall he paid a tax say, one-half of 1 per cent per anntim on the nveracc amount of notes in circulation. It Is further provided thnt there shall be no national bank notes Issued of less denomination than ten dollars that each national bank, except In case of 11 failed bank, shall redeem or retire Its notoB 111 the first Instance at Its own office or nt agencies to be designated by It anil that I conclude this communication fully appre ciating that tbe responsibility for all legis lation afTectlng the people of the United States rests upon their representatives In the congress, and assuring them that whether In accordance with recommenda tions I have made or not. I shall bo glad to co-operate In perfecting any legislation that tends to the prosperity and welfare of our country. —Grover Cleveland. Executive Mansion, Dec. 3, 1894. Debt Ordered rulil.

Another very Important feature of this plan Is the exemption of state banks from taxation by the United States in cases where It is shown to the satisfaction of the secretary of the treasury and the controller of the currency by bnnks claiming such exemption that they have not had outstand ing their circulating notes exceeding 7.1 per cent of their paid-up aud unimpaired cap ital: that their stockholders are Individually liable for the redemption of their circu lating notes to the full extent of their ownership of stock: that the liability of said banks upon their circulating notes con stitutes under their state law 11 first lieu upon their assets: that such banks liavo kept and malntnined a guarantee fund In United States legal lender notes. Including treasury notes of 1890, equal to 30 per cent of their outstanding circulating notes, aud that such banks have promptly redeemed their circulating notes when presented at their principal or branch offices. It Is quite likely that this scheme may lie usefully amended In some of its details but I am satisfied It furnishes a basis for a very great Improvement In our present banking and currency system.
