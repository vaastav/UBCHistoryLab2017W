B. Hint, ship Marion Chilcott and the schooner S. C. Allen are in the posses sion of Joseph T. Liddy, local agent of the Sailor's Union. They were ca.t at the last two meetings of the local branch, seventy-seven ballots all told, and after the balloting next Monday of other union sailors in port, the en tire bumlle of ballots will be forwarded - to the tSan Francisco headquarters and will form a portion of all the ballots cast there in the selection of a new agent for the Honolulu branch of the bailor's Union. Joseph T. Liddy, the present local gent, retires at the end of the year, and does not seek reappointment. In faet he says that the joD is too strenu ous for him at least in Honolulu, anl lie wouldn't retain office at $300 a week. The San Francisco headquarters of this powerful union will manage the election of the new agent. Five can didates are listed, including Mr. Liddy, An spite of himself. The five are B. '-Xw Hamilton, formerly with the S. C. 'Allen as seeond mate; Mr. Sorenson, Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Steinberg, who ran a restaurant at one time in Honolulu, and the incumbent. In the opinion of the present agent, Mr. Sorenson would be acceptable. He is a member of the Masonic order. "No, sir," said Liddy yesterday af ternoon at the office of the U. S. Ship ping Commissioner, "none for me. My methods do not appear to be appre ciated, but I andmy methods will bear the strictest investigation, for I always like to live within the pale of the Uni ted States shipping laws and all other laws besides. If I do not get a Fed eral appointment in January, why, to nse a Biblical quotation, it will then be with me, 'Arise, Joseph, take up thy bed and walk or sail.' " Ethel Zane's Pilikias. The pilikia aboard the American schooner Ethel Zane continued yester day and there were conferences in which Shipping Commissioner Almy, Harold Dillingham and others partic ipated. i;ptain Pederson is out of a job, and will probably return to the less conspicuous duties of second mate aboard the W. B. Flint. It is understood that Captain Rose hill has been given command, and with that well known navigator in charge, the Ethel Znne will once more become a well-dLsciplined, inconspicuous lumber carrier. On account of the determina tion of the newly selected crew not to fail under Captain Pederson. the ship was eertainly undermanned and there was no one left aboard to wind the chronometer but the cook, and he per formed this duty as well as he turned out meals. Lurline Has Full List. A wireless message from the steam ship Lurline was received by the agents j-esterday morning, announcing that she was bringing forty passengers. This Ss pretty nearly as many passengers as the Lurline can comfortably carry. In addition She is bringing a very large cargo of gereral merchandise. The Lur line will arrive here this morning. Buford will be Full. When the United States Army trans port Buford leaves this port for Ma nila on December 5 she will carry a full list of passengers, as well as a large number of recruits and casuals. The Buford also will have a full cargo of commissarv and quartermaster sup plies. Call, Nov. 30. Shipping Notes. The next regular mail from here to the Coast is per the Nippon Maru on the ISth. Repairs have been made to the par tially dismasted island schooner Ka Moi and "she may be ready to go to sea by the first of the week. A new foremast has been shipped.

(Mail Special to the Advertiser.) WASHINGTON, D. C, November 23. Extra sessions of Congress, such as that which President-elect Taft has promised to call next spring, always tower high in public interest. Official ly they are called "extraordinary ses sions." There has been hardly an extra session that did not develop something of historic importance, to be recalled and expatiated upon, long after the ordinary sessions of the Fed eral lawmaking bodies have been for gotten. For that reason the people have been educated to look upon an extra session as a very noteworthy in cident of any administration at Wash ington. And yet an extra session of Con gress in action is generally very tame and uninteresting to the looker-on in Washington. It rarely has half the in terest to visitors, or even to the case hardened residents of the national cap ital, that a regular session has. It may rmt be so with the extra session of the jrst year of "the Taft adminis tration, -but, aJl the same, the signs point to many exceedingly dull, dreary days on the hill where the Capitol stands. Manufacturers and merchants will be deeply concerned over the rais ing orlowering of duties on articles, mostly of strange names. A fraction one way or another can easily precipi tate a-.iprotest of voiceful proportions. In the lorg run all these things affect the millions of plain people, who have to foot the bills, but the plain people are generally Very indifferent to such matters of legislation. If they have any rearing and tearing to do, it will probably come long after the revision law has been signed and after news pavers and orators have dinned it into fliAir hpii.l that their representatives S down at Washington have given some body ei?e the Jong end ot tne tarm bargain. Uncertainty About Big Debate. There may be a big tariff debate, bnt big debates in Congress can not safely be prognosticated. Those that are wilely advertised have an annoying tendency not to become big debates at all. On the other hand, a few words spoken in the course of routine pro ceedings often loose an avalanche of heated discussion. Should some Demo crat get his knife into a crevice of the Republican protection armor, as may or may not happen half a dozen times during consideration of the forth coming tariff bill, there would be a high ' old 'congressional shindy every time the performance occurred. The Democrats are already promising some tariff oratory, especially the Senate Democrats, but it is possible to put too much faith in such promises. An impression prevails in Washing ton that public sentiment in the Unit ed States, after much rantankerous ac tivity under the prodding of Theodore Koosevelt, President, is relapsing into a dormant and satisfied state, much as it was dnring the years of the Mc Kinley administration. The people want to make money, lots of money, and' then more money, again. If it turns out that public sentiment is be coming indifferent, it will be difficult to stir up much of a tariff debate at the extra session of Congress, for pub lic sentiment is a tremendous factor in making legislators at Washington sit up and take notice. If their constit uents case to swarm on the ramparts, -vnf.cCmcn hci-nmp lethargic and it is easier to put 'inrougu uijj Washington. House Will Speed the Bill. No great tariff debating is looked for in the House of Representatives during the extra session. It can be put down as certain that "Uncle Joe" Canton, who will be reelected Speaker, and all his lieutenants will be very impatient about the running of the sands by the time the extra session has been organ ized for business. They will give just as few davsfa? they think will be safe for disUSSTTTif thr tariff bill. Terhaps they will allow the debate to be "wide open" for a week or thereabouts. But the muttering in th corridors and cloakrooms about the folly of staying ir Washington all summer, when men m'aht be home, attending to personal business and making money, will be come rampant after a little. The Speaker and 390 oth?r members will be making fling at their ancient enemy, the Senate. Every Represen tative is an enemy of the Senate till hp himslf is elected thereto. The pros pect of a long talk on tariff at that end of the Capitol will be emphasized and then will come the argument, old as the application of the cloture rule in the Hous, that it is no use to waste time talking when the House must wait anvway till the Senate talks itself out. The tariff revision bill will be as good as framed by the time the extra ?esion of Congress convenes. That will probablv be about the middle of March. Mr. Taft has already said that he will call it iut as soon as he can. While no leng'thv notice is required by the constitution, it. is usual to allow about two weeks. That gives Senators and members time to get to Washington. Even the delegates from Hawaii and Alaska can travel from Honolulu and Sitka in fifteen days. Election of a Speaker. The Senate and House must both or ganize as sion as Congress meets in extra "ion, for it will be the first eion of a new Congress. The House w ll proceed to that task speedily. It ha more to d.T in the organization line than ha-! the S- nate. but generally does it more speedily. The Senate always ha- a i residing officer, ready to take up the znv-1. The House at the begin ning of a Congress, has no presiding officer ar.d the verv first thing must choose cn. That will be done in two or three Toll calls, for the Republican caucus which will meet a few days in advance, will haxe nominated, not only a candidate for Speaker, but candidates for half a dozen offices, including clerk, sergeant-at-anns, chaplain, doorkeeper, and postmaster. One day will suffice for that work and for the swearing in of members and for the great biennial lottery in which 391 members will draw their seats for the next two years. But the House is powerless to enact any legis lation till after its committees have been announced. That is the Speaker's privilege, as he selects the men for ev ery committee: There may be a fight on the adoption of the rules next spring, but the chances are that wise old " Uncle Joe " will be able to squelch all the rules reformers before Congress meets and that, after some demonstra tions of hostility, the House will by resolution adopt the rules of the 60th Congress. It almost goes without saying that the Speaker will appoint only those committees that have to do with legis lation suggested in the President's mes sage. For it is a practise, generally adhered to. that an extra session of Congress shall consider little business outside of that for which the President called it together. That means the Speaker will appoint only the Ways and Means, the Rules, and the Mileage and Accounts committees. He can do that in short order. The Ways and Means membership will be about the same a9 in the present Congress and will deal with the revision, which probably will be the only legislative matter men tioned in President Taft's message. Want Their Mileage Early. The Rules Committee is the govern ing body, through which the Speaker makes his wishes effective. The Mile age Committee attends to the little mat ter of twenty cents a mile for the en tire distance traveled by every member and delegates in coming to attend the session. It was intended that this "graft," as it is commonly called, should be cut off, when, the salaries of Congressmen were raised from $5000 to $7500 a year. But the provision abolish ing it was beautifully juggled and your $7500 statesman or politician is still as keen as ever to get it. The money can not be paid without the O. K. of the Mileage Committee and therefore its mpmhers are alwavs announced as soon i as that of any other committee. The mileage, amounting to as much as $600 or $700 for some of the Pacific Coast keeps Senators and members in pocket money for the earlier part of the ses sion. The House will be working hard for the first two or three weeks. It will meet Monday and every other week day and have no adjournments, except for Sunday, from the time that the Ways and Means Committee brings the completed bill from its rooms in tne big office building, either up the broad asphalted way of New Jersey avenue, or through the subterranean tunnel, and introduces it in the House till the last roll has been called on its passage. Meanwhile the Senate will be work ing very leisurely indeed. Its reorgan ization will consist -largely of finding committee places for Senators and also of looking out that Senators secure comfortable and cosy committee rooms. Those are two subjects very dear to your United States Senator. The long er he wears a toga the harder he wiil fight and the mor wires he wilIuTl, both to get desirable committee assign ments and, eke, a nice committee room. That matter may occupy a couple of weeks, but there will be little indica tion of it in the Senate, for the work will be done by carefully selected com mittees of oldsters, one for the Repub licans and one for the Democrats, who will see to it that no new comer gets anything that can .make him feel at all uppish. Nominations to be Ratified. For a time the Senate will almost certainly be adjourning every Thursday till the" following Monday. It would nrUnnrn earlier but for the fact that I the constitution forbids either House of Congress to adjourn for more tnan three days at a time without the con sent of the other. There will be some executive business to dispose of per haps a treaty or two to be ratified and undoubtedly several large batches of nominations from President Taft to be confirmed. y - As soon as the" House has its last roll call on the Payne revision bill for the new tariff law will be known as the Payne law in honor of the Ways and Means chairman the Senate Finance Committee will begin to "spunk up." How long that commit tee will require to go over the Payne bill is a matter of conjecture. The prospects are that it will not be more than two or three weeks. Much will depend upon the extent to whieh the Finance Committee wishes to rewrite the House measure and the number of witnesses it hears. Almost from the day that the Senate and the Finance Committee get the Payne bill the House will begin ad journing for three days at a stretch unless President Taft recommends in his message legislation other than on the tariff. That is what the House did at the last extra session of note that of li97, when the Dingley law was passed. It enables members who live a day's ride or so from Washington to go home and attend to their own busi ness. It also enables the House to em phasize to the country that it has dis posed of the tariff bill and but for the dilatory Senate the country would now have a" tariff law and there would be no more cause to worry about it. The House leaders are very fond of em phasizing that, when any legislation such as a tariff bill is on the ways. They never take the pains to emphasize that most legislation of that character has to come from the House, by provi sion of the constitution, and that the Senate, even if it be the bulwark of (vested interests, as has been claimed, legislates much more carefully than tne House and, in many instances, much better. Long Discussion in Senate. The tariff debate in the Senate will almost certainly last two or three weeks, perhaps a month or even two months, and during all that time, as well at during the deliberations of the Finance Committee, the House will be meeting formally every three days and promptly adjourning for three days more. , As soon as the last Senate roll-call on the Pavne bill has been taken, the UMiallv long and earnest struggle in conference begins. The conferees may take a week or a month to adjust their differences, during which both Senate and House may enjoy three-day re cesses. All the tariff bills of reeent vears have been passed only after ter rific contests in conference, which con ference is usually composed of either three or five members of the Ways and Means Committee and a similar number of the Finance Committee. It was so with the Wilson bill and again with the Dingley bill. But not only are standpatters in the saddle in the Senate and the House, but they are now standpatters, who enjoy very amic able relations and who think along about the same lines. They, have been cooperating as never before in the preliminary work of gathering data for a "scientific revision" (a favorite Standpat term just now), and it may happen that they will break some rec ords next summer in cooperating to ward the speedy enactment of a new tariff law. The men who will figure as leaders at the extra session can easily be named in advance. For the House there will be Speaker Cannon, Chair man Sereno E. Payne and Representa tive John Dalzell of the Ways and Moans Committee, and a Democrat or two, chief of whom will be Champ Clark of Missouri, slated for minority lead er. The other Republican lieutenants in the House will have small chance of gaining much notoriety, as matters look now. They are men identified with other committees which have nothing to do with tariff legislation. Will Tolerate No "Butting In." It is only once in a decade or there abouts that the Ways and Means Com mittee has a chance to get into the limelight when the tariff is being re vised and it naturally keeps all the glory for itself. They will resent any "butting in" except from the Speak er. Members of the very powerful Appropriations Committee, for in stance, must sit with folded hands. Of course, an individual member, or two, who bestirs himself greatly, may gain some notoriety and, perhaps, some rep utation of importance, in connection with th: proceedings, but it is very improbable that anyone in the House, except the Speaker and the Ways and Means Republicans, will exert any notable influence in fashioning the bill. ,The Senate leaders will be chiefly three Senators Aldrich of Rhode Is land, chairman of Finance; Hale of Maine, a member thereof, and Culber son of Texas, who will be the leader of the Senate minority. There is more probability of individual Senators, out side of the Finance Committee, exert ing some positive influence in shap ing the tariff bill than of a like oc currence in the House. The Dingley law was enacted under very similar circumstances to those under which the Payne law will be passed. Its chronology may therefore be worth while, as indicating some thing of what may be expected of next spring's extra session. r The extra, or first, session 0f the Fifty-fifth Congress was called to meet March 15, 1897, by President .McKinley, eleven days after he was inaugurated. Representative Dingley of Maine, chairman of Ways and Means, introduced bill No. 379, "to provide revenue for the govern ment and to encourage the industries of the United States," on March 18. ttjhad been prepared by the Republi ifffns of the committee previous to that time, and No. 379 represented the de liberate judgment of the committee. It was formally reported to the House Friday, March 19, there having been a meeting of the full committee in the meantime, at which the Democrats of the committee were given the courtesy of having a first look at the measure. Discussion on the Dingley Bill. The House debate on the bill began Monday, March 22, and was concluded with the passage of the bill March 31. The House had met at 10 o'clock daily and had held evening sessions from 8 till 11 for purposes of debate. The Senate received the till April 1 and it was immediately referred to the Finance Committee, which reported it back to the Senate May 4. The Sen ate debate on the bill, which had vir tually been rewritten by Senator Al drich, was not concluded till July 7. The conferees were forthwith appoint ed, but did not reach an agreement till July 19. Senate and House thereupon entered into a debate on the conference report, and it was Julv 21 before that report had been finally accepted by both houses. It was signed by President McKinley the same day, whieh day the extra session adjourned. While both branches of Congress were almost as strongly Republican then as now, the chances favor a more speedy enactment at next spring's ses sion. President Taft will likely have the Payne law by the middle of June, perhaps earlier. The Wilson law was enacted at the regular, or long session, of the Fifty third Congress. It assembled December 4, 1893. and lasted till August 23 of the following year. The Republicans have become very chary of framing a tariff bill at a regular session of Con gress. It can be done only at the long session, which meets in December, after a President is inaugurated, and generally runs up to within a few months of the next Congressional elec tion. The formal party claim always is that there is not sufficient oppor tunity for calm deliberation over a tariff bill at a regular session, but ai stronger reason is that if the people get mad when they at last find out what a tariff law ' contains, there is time for their anger to cool before election, provided the work is done in an extra session. Otherwise with pub lic sentiment aroused right in the midst of a campaign, the party that enacted the tariff law will almost cer tainly be defeated in the election for Congress. Gave Democrats the House. That was the case wih the McKin ley tariff law. It has been declared a very fair tariff law, but there was great jopular misunderstanding of it, which the Republicans could not dispel in time to have their case decided on its merits at the elections for the Fifty-seeond Congress, and the Democrats came into the control of the House by an almost unprecedented majority. There was a little analogy with the situation at the close of the Fifty-third Congress, when the Republicans used the Wilson tariff bill to great advantage and won a tre mendous majority at the elections for the Fifty-fourth Congress. A notable extra session of the last twenty years was that during the first year of Cleveland's second administra tion, when the Democrats controlled both branches of Congress. It was called August 7, 1S93, to repeal the silver purchase clause. The Senate Democrats were nearly all Silverites. There were enough of them, with Silver Republicans, to make a clear niajoritv. But Mr. Cleveland picked off the Dem ocrats one by one till the majority had become a minority. Just before the re peal was passed and the work of the extra session concluded, in earlv No vember, Senator Teller, of Colorado, then a Republican, who is now about to retire from the Senate as a Demo crat, announced that he had come to Washington with a good supply of win ter clothing. He was sure he would need it before the repeal bill became law. The same day the bill passed, the late Senator Ishain G. Harris, of Ten nessee, who, like Mr. Teller, was an ardent silver man, paraded one of the Capitol corridors, announcing fiercely that a certain hot place would freeze over before such an enactment would be sanctioned by the Senate. In a few hours, however, the Senate had voted and Mr. Cleveland had won the great est victory of either of his administra tions. Roosevelt's Extra Session. . President Roosevelt called but one extra session. That was of the Fifty eighth Congress, and assembled No vember 9, 1903. He hoped to speed the enactment of Cuban reciprocity legis lation. It made the leaders of the Sen ate and House very angry, and they spent the month of November in doing nothing. 'The regular session, which became the second of that Congress, assembled December 9. The two sessions were really merged into one and, as has been said, were so close together that one could not stick a sheet of paper between them. An episode of that extra session was an effort of House Republicans to col lect double mileage, although no Sen ator or member had had time to go home, hardly time, as one wag express ed it, to draw a breath between the moment when the gavels of the pre siding officers fell to adjourn the ex tra session and fell again to call the regular session to order. 

MOVES AFTER FD7TY YEARS. MARE ISLAND, November 29. With the nearing of the completion of the new Mare Island dry dck comes the news from Washington that, the re ceiving ship Independence, which has been moored just below the mouth of the new dry dock for nearly fifty years, is to be moved to another section of the island, so as to make way for im provements at that section of the yard, as the yards and docks department has received orders to construct a 250-foot quay wall on both sides of the mouth of the new dock. The Independence has the honor of being the last of the old ships of the line left in the Navy. She was built in 1814 at Charlestown, Mass., and was the first of the seventy-four-gun line of battleships bu;lt for service against the fleets of Great Britain. After a long and useful service she was4 converted into a receiving ship for the Mare Is land Navy Yard in 1858, and is one of the landmarks. At the same time that the Independ ence is moved, the gunboat Manila, which was captured from the Spanish and which is moored near the Independ ence, and is used as a provision ship by the yard authorities, will also be moved to another location. .

License Inspector Fennell, assisted by Officer Medeiros and Ben Main and Eli Crabbe of the country police force, raided a blind pig at the Waimalu camp last night, arresting the keeper, Okada. He was detected in the act of passing out dago red wine to a Korean informer. A search of his premises brought to light a five-gallon demijohn of the same brand of rotgut, a demi john of sake for the Japanese trade, and other liquors. He was released after arrest on $150 cash bail. . OFFERS GOOD CHANCE TO HAWAII (Continued from Page One.) Mr. Storey is himself the president of one of the local exchanges which make up the main exchange, of which he is also president, and his work in organizing the orange growers has had much to do with the success of that organization. The whole proposition is directly along the lines suggested, by Mr. Newell as the one certain , way in which the Hawaiian fruit industry could be made a success. Senator Charles A. Culberson is un doubtedly one of the most silent Te-ans that the State ever produced, A fellow Texan, in speaking of the senator's career, admitted that this, however, was nothing against him. "He's just con servative." he added, "like his old daddy. During the war Culberson, Sr., was colonel of a regiment. He was a practical old gentleman, and took his command into the panehrake in north ern Louisiana, and somehow kept it there. Nobodv seemed to be able to dislodge him. lie stayed there, too, un til the" war was over, and the regiment that went out at the beginning of hostili ties, yoo strong. Colonel Culberson brought home 100 strong. 'Think I was going to take my boys out where thev would be butchered?' said he to his townsmen. 'Four of them wandered awav to New Orleans and actually got shot'!'" f ,Sf ; J? ! 2 v:sr
