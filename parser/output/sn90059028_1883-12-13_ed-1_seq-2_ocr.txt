Mr. Watson hadn't been gone long be fore Mrs. Watson came home from a neighbor's. The book agent saw her, ana went in and persuaded the wife te, to buy another copy of the same book! She was ignorant of the fact that het husband had bought the same book in the morning. When.Mr. Watson came back from New York at night Mrs. Wat son showed him the book. "I don't want to see it," said Wateon frowning terribly. "Why, husDand?" asked bis wife. ''Because that rascally book agent sold me the same book this morning. Now we've got two copies of the same book two copies of the 'Early Christian Martyrs,' and "But, husband, we can—" "No, we can't eitherl" interrupted Mr. Watson, "The man is off on the train before this. Confound it! I could kill the feliow. I—" "Why, there ha goes to, the depot now," said Mrs. Watson, pointing out of the window at the retreating form of the book agent making for the train. "But its too late to catch him, and I'm not dressed. I've taken off mj boots, and—" Just then Mr. Stevens, a neighbor of Mr. Watson, drove by,- when Watson pounded on the window-pane in a fran tic manner, almost frightening the horse. "Here, Stevens," he shouted, "you're hitched up won't you run your horse down to the train and hold that book agent till I come? Run! Catch 'im now!'1 "All right," said Mr. Stevens, whip ping up Sis horse and tearing down tne roaa. Mr. Stevens reached tbe train just as the conductor shouted "'all aboard!" "Book agent 1" he yelled, as the book agent stepped on to the train. "Book agent! hold on! Watson wants to see you." "Watson? Watson wants to see tne?" repeated the seemingly puzsled book agent. "Oh, I know what heVants! he wants to trajr one of my books but I can't miss the train to sell it him." "If that is all he 'wants, I can pay for it and take it back to him. How much isitl" "Two dollars ior the 'Eariy Christian Martyrs,'" said the book agent, as he reached for the money and patted the book out through the car window. Just then Mr. Watson arrived, puffing and blowing in his shirt sleeves. As he .saw the train pull ont he was too full for utterance.

Bandail and Eeifer escorted the gentleman to the chair. His entrance into the chamber was tbe signal for loud applause. Upon taking the chair Mr. Carlisle said: Gentle men of the House of Representatives: I thank yon sincerely for the honor conferred upon me by the vote just taken. To be chosen from the membership of a body like this, to preside over its deliberations, is a distinction upon which any citizen may prop erly congratulate himself, and I assure you yv or kindness is fully appreciated. At the same time I realize the fact that the position to which you have assigned me ia one of very great labor and respon sibility, and while profoundly grateful for this man ifestation of your confidence, I shall endeavor to discharge its duties with serious distrust of my capacity to meet in an acceptable manner the re quirements of the office..I promise, however, to de vote to your service all the zeal and ability which I am possessed of. Gentlemen, the mainten ance of order on the floor is essential, absolutely essential, to the intelligent and systematic transac tion of publio business, and I earnestly invite you assistance in enforcing the rules adopted govern ing our Itroceedings. The large addition to the membership of the house resulting from the late apportionment of representatives makes this duty even more difficult $han before, and without your cordial co-operation and support I cannot reason ably nope to discbarge tbe ordinary daily duties of thisoffioe. That you will cheerfully co-operate with me in every proper effort to preserve order and facilitate the business of legislation "I have no doubt. But, gentlemen, I shall ask something more than mere co-operation. Assuring you of my earnest desire at all times ta be just and impar tial, still I cannot ezuect to avoid mistakes, and shall be compelled, therefore, to freauenlly, no doubt, rely on the friendly forbearance of the gen tlemen of both sides of the house. I am sure, gentlemen, all matters of legislation presented to this congress wiH receive from yon Buch careful consideration as the magnitude and character of the interests involved require, and your action upon them be wise, patriotic aud con servative. Sudden and radical changes of laws and regulations effecting the commercial and in dustrial interests of the people ought never to be made, nnless imperatively demanded by some pub lic emergency, and, in my opinion, under the exist ing circumstances, such changes would not be fa vorably received by aay considerable number of those who have given serious attention to the sub ject. TApplause.] Many reforms are undoubtedly necessary, and it will be your duty, after a careful examination of the whole subject in all its bearings, to decide how far they should extend, and when and in what manner they should be made. [Ap plause.] If there be any who fear that your action on this or any other subject will actually be injuri ous to any interest, or even afford reasonable cause for alarm, I am quite sure they will be agreeably disappointed. What the country has a right to expect of you is strict economy of admin istration in every department of the government, just and equal taxation for public purposes, faith fal observance of the limitations of the constitu tion, scrupulous regard for the rights and interests of the great body of tbe people, in order that they be protected, for congress has power to protect them against encroachments from every direction. Whatever can be done under the circumstances surrounding us to meet this expectation ought to be done in more judgment. But. gentlemen, without detaining you further, I am ready to take the oath of office prescribed in the constitution and laws and proceed to complete the organization of the house. (Applanse) The ironclad oath was administered by Mr. Kelly, the oldest member in continuous service, and Speaker Carlisle called the house to order. The roll of states was called and members came forward and took the oath and the bouse ad journed. Tuesday, December 4.

PRESIDENTIAL POINTEES 4V --.xir. iT•• V*.. ," .A iV? President Aftirar Favors the People with |Us Third Annual THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FOBEIGN BELATIONS. To the Congre38 of tne United States: At the threshold of your deliberations I congratu late yon upon the favorable aspect of the do mestic and foreign affairs of this government Our relations with other cations continue to be on a friendly footing. With tbe Argentine Re public, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Italy, Santo Domingo and. Sweden and Norway, no inci dent has occurred which calls for special com ment The recent opening of new lines of telegraphic communication with Central Amer ica and Brazil permitted the interchange of messages of friendship with the gov ernments of those countries. Dur ing the year there have been perfeoted and proclaimed consular and com mercial treaties with Servia and a consular treaty with Roumania, thus extending our in tercourse with the Danpbian countries, while our Eastern relations have been placed upon a wider basis by treaties with Corea and Madagascar. The new boundary survey treaties with Mexico, a tradesmark convention and a supplementary extradition treaty with Spain, and a oonvSntion extending the duration of the Franco-American claims ommission, have also been proclaimed. Notice of the termination of the fisheries arti cles of the treaty of Washington was duly given Great Britain. The privileges and exemptions of the treaty will seemingly close on July 1, 1885. The fishing industry pursued by a numerous class of our citizeus on Northern coasts, both of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, are worthy or the fostering care of congress. Whenever brought tnto competition with like industries in other countries, our fishermen, as well as manufacturers of fishing appliances and preparers of fish products, have main tained a foremost place. I suggest that con gress create a commission to consider the question of our rights in the fish eries, and the means of opening to our citizens, under just and enduring conditions, the richly stooked fishing aters aud sealing grounds of British .forth America. A question baa arisen touching the deportation to the United States favun the British islands, by government or municipal aid, of persons unable there to gain a living and equally a burden on the commun ity here. Such of these persons who come under the pauper class, as defined by the law, have been sent back, according to the provisions of our statutes. Her majesty's government has insisted that precautions have been taken be fore shipment was made. However, they have in BO many cases proven ineffectual, aud espe cially so in oertain instances of needy immierauts reacbiug our territory through Canada, that a revision of onr legislation upon this subject may be deemed advisable. Correspondence relative to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty has been continued, and will be laid before congress. 

AMEBICAN POBK. The legislation o( France against the impor tation of prepared swine produced from the United States, has been repealed. That result has been duo no less to the friendly relation of this gov- rnment than to a growing conviction in Fracce that tbo restriction is not de manded by any real danger to health. Ger many still prohibits the introduction of all swine produots from America. I extended to the imperial government a friendly invitation to send experts to the United States to inquire whether the use of these products was danger ous to health. This invitation was declined I have believed it of such importance, how ever, that the exact facts should ba ascertained and promulgated that 1 have appointed a com petent commission to make a thorough investi gation of the subject. Ita members have shown their public spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation, but I trust that congress will see in the national and international bear ings of the matter sufficient motives for providing at least for the reimbursement of such expenses as they may necessarily incur. The coronation of the czar at Moscow afforded to the government an occasion for testifying to continued friendship by sending a special envoy and a representative of the navy to at tend the ceremony. While there have arisen during the year no grave questions affecting the status in the Russian empire of American citizens or other faith than that held by the national church, this government remains firm in its convictions that the rights of its oitizens abroad shonld be in no way affected by their. religious belief. It is understood that measures for the removal of the restrictions which now burden our trade with Cuba and Porto Rico are under consider ation by the Spanish government The prox imity of Cuba and the peculiar method of ad ministration which there prevails necessitate constant discussion and appeal on oar cart from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I regret to say that just protests of this gov ernment have not as yet produced satisfactory results. The commission appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens against 'he government after the recognition of sat isfactory rules as to their validity was admit ted to be illegal Full reparation for the iujuries sustained by ourcitizeDS should be no longer delayed and the farce of naturalization in the United States as a shield to disturbers in other countries abolished The claims com mission has finally adjourned. Some of its awards, though made more than two years ago, have not yet been paid. Specie payment is expected. Claims to a large amount which were held by the late commission with out its jurisdiction have been presented to the Spanish government, as tho ac tion of the colonial law authorities has given rise to these claims. The ease of the Masonio has not yet reached a settlement The Manilla court baa found that the proceedings of whioh this government has complained were authorized, and it is hoped that tbe government of Spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which its sense of justice Bhould impel it to offer for the un usual severity and unjust action of its sub ordinate colonial officers in the case of this vesseL The Helvetian confederation has pro nosed the inauguration of a class of interna al treaties for the deferment to arbitration of grave questions between nations. This government has assented to the proposed inauguration of such already with Switzerland. Under the treaty of Berlin, liberty of con science and civil rights are assured to all strangers in Bulgaria As the United States have no distinct conventional relations with that country, and are not a party to the treaty, they should in my opinion maintain diplomatic representation also for the improvement of in ercourseand the proper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers. I sug gest that I be given authority to establish an agency and consulate at the Bulgarian capital. The Uuited States are now particicating in a revision of the tariff of the. Ottoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax of foreigners doing business in Tur kev, but have opposed the oppressive storage tax upon petroleum entering ports of that country. The government of the khedive has proposed that the authority of the mixed judi cial tribunals in Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the United States accused of. crime, who are now tried before consular courts. This goverument is not indisposed to aocept the change, but believes that its terms should be submitted for .criticism to the commission appointed to revise the whole subject BELATTOHS WITH MEXICO. At no time in' our national history has there been more manifest need of close and lasting relations with a neighboring State than now exists with respect to Mexioo. The rapid influx of our capital and enterprise into that country shows what has already been accomplished by tbe vast reciprocal a'dvantages which must attend the progress of its internal develop ments. The treaty of commerce and naviga tion of 1848 has hsen determined by the Mexican government, and in the absence of convention engagements the rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend npon the domestic statutes of that republic. Th'ere have been instances of harsh enforcement of the laws against ourve sels and citizens in Mexico, and of denial of diplo matic resort for their protection. The in itial step toward a better understading has been taken in. the negotiation, by the commis sion authorized by congress, of a treaty whioh ia still before the senate for approval. The provisions for the reciprocal defense of the frontier by the troops in pursuit of hos tile Indians have been prolonged for another year. The operations of the forces of both governments against savages have been successful, and several of the mpst dangerous tribes dispersed by the skill and valor of United States and Mexican soldiers fighting in a common cause. The convention for the resnrvey of the bbundary from the Rio Grande to the Pacific having been ratified and exchanged, the preliminary reconnois sance therein stipulated ha been effected. It now rests with congress to make provision for completing the survey and resetting the boun dary monuments. A convention was signed with 'Mexico on July 13,1882, providing for the rehearing of the case of Benjamin 4 Weil VS. The Abra Sylon MininR Company, in whose favor ainrds were made by the late American and Mexican claims commission, That con ventionstill awaits the action of the senate. Meanwhile, because of the charges of fraudu lent awarda which have made anew commis sion neoessary, the executive has directed the suspension of pay of the distribution quota re eeivad from Mexicv ICiK NBXOHBOBS.^- tjtto Central Amer oommerclel relations untrvrjustify, in my increase of oonaular OUB oniXBaXt ourpoliti and the seat of that jplaoe ii eaeh eapitai a consul strategio Hostilities to that of negotia tion, in which the consuls' of thifc government have been exercised. The demands of Chill for absolute cession of territory have been maintained and accepted by the party of Gen. Iglesias to the extent of concluding a treaty of peace with the government of Chili, .in general conformity with the tarms of the pro tocol signed in May last bitween the Chilian oommandry and Gen. ifelesias. As a result of the conclusion of this treaty Gen. Iglesias has been formally recognizod by Chili as-preside^t of Peru, and his government installed at Lima, whioh has been evacuated by the Chilians. A call haB been issued by Gen. Iglesias for a rep resentative assembly to be elected on t{ie 13 th of January, and to meet at Lima on the 1st of March next. Moauwhile the provisional gov ernment of Gen. Iglesias has applied for rec ognition to the principal powers.of America aud Europe. When tne will of tbe Peruvian people shall be manifested 1 shall not hesitate to recognize the diplomatic and representatives approved by them. Represen tatives of this government attended at Caracas the centennial celebration of the birth of the illustrious Bolivar. At the same time tbe unveiling of a statue of Washington in the Venezuelan capital testified to the veneration in which his memory is held there. Congress at its last session authorized the executive to pro pose to the Venezuelan government a reopening of the awards of the mixed commission of Car aoas, and the departure from this country of the Venezuelan minister has delayed the open ing of negotiations for reviving the commis sion. This government holds that, until the re-establishment of a treaty on this subjeot, tbe Venezuelan government must continue to make these payments provided for in the convention of 1866. There is ground for be lief that the dispute growing out of tbe un paid obligations due from Venezuela to France will be satisfactorily adjusted. The French cabinet has proposed a basis of settlement whioh meets my approval, but as it involves a recasting of the annua*, quotas of tbe foreign debt it has been deemed advisable to submit the proposal to tbe judgementa of the cabinets of Berlin, Copenhagen, the Hague, London and Madrid. TQE SANDWICH ISLANDS. At the recent coronation of his malesty King Ealakana this government was repre sented diplomatically and by the formal visit of a vessel of war. The question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before congress. I am con vinced that the charges of abuse and frauds under that treaty have been exaggerated, and I renew the suggestions of last year's message, that the treaty be modified wherever its pro visions have proved onerous to legitimate trade. I am not disposed to favor the entire cessation of treaty relations which have fos tered sood will between tho countries, and contributed toward the equality of Hawaiian among the nations. GOOD WHJII IN THE OBIENT. In pursuance of the policy declared by this government of extending our inter course with the Eastern nations, legations have during tho past year been established in Per sia, Siam and Corea. It is probable that per manent missions from those countries will ere long be maintained in the United States. A special embassy from Siam is now on its way hither. Treaty relations with Corea were per fected by the exchange at Simul on tbe 19th of May last of the ratification of tbe lately con cluded convention, and envoys from the king of Zanzibar have visited this country and received a cordial wel come. Corea, as yet unacquainted withJ the methods of Western civilization now in vites the attention of those interested in the foreign trade, as it needs the implements and products which the United States are ready to supply. We seek no monopoly of its com merce aud no advantage over other nations, but as the Cliinoso in eaching for a higher civilization have confided in this republic, we cannot regard with indifference any encroach ments on their rights. CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES. China, by the payment of a money indemni ty, has settled certain of the long-pending claims of our citizens. aq,d I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon be adjusted. Questions have arisen touching the rights of American and -other foreign manufacturers in China, under tho provisions of treaties which permit aliens to exercise their industries in that country. On this specific point onr own treaty is silent But under the operation of the mo-.t favored na'ions clause we have like privileges to thoie of other powers. While it is the duty of the government to seo that our citizens navo the full enjoyment of eveiy benefit secured by treaty, I doubt the expediency of lead ing in movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation by which we have only an indirect right to exact the transference to China of American capital. For the employment there of Chinese labor would in effect inaugurate a competition for the control of markets now 'supplied by our home industries. There ia good reason to be lieve that the law restricting the immigra tion of Chinese has been violated intentionally or otherwise by the officials of China upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the emigrants belong to the excepted classes. Measures have been taken to ascertain the facts incident to this supposed infraction and it is believed that the government of China will co-operate with the United States in securing the faithful observance of the law. The same considerations which prompted con gress at its last session to return to Japan the Simoneski indemnity seem to me to require at its hands like action in respect to the Can ton indemnity fund, now amounting to $300, 000. The question of the. general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has been consid ered in an international conference held at Tokio, but without definite result as yet. This government is disposed to concede the requests of Japair to" determine its own tariff duties, pro vide such proper judicial tribunals as may commend themselves to the Western powers for the trial of causes to which foreigners, are parties, and to assimilate the terms and decla rations of its treaties to those of other civilized States. Through our ministers at Loadon and Monrovia, this government has endeavored to aid Liberia in its differences with Great Britaiu, touching the boundaries of that republic. There as a prospect of the adjustment of the dispute by the adoption of the Mannah river as the line. This arrangement is a compromise of the con flicting territorial claims. The rich and populous valley of the Congo is being opened to commerco by a society called the International African asso ciation, of which the king of the Belgians is president, and a citizen of the Unit9d States chief executive officer, and large tracts of territory have been ceded to the association by native chiefs. The objects of this association are philanthropic. It does not aim at perma nent political ooutro!, but seeks the neutrality of- the valleys which have been Opened. Steamboats placed on tbe river and the nuclei of states established *t twenty-two stations under one flag, which offers freedom to commerce and prohibts the slave trade. The United States cannot be indifferent to this work, nor to the interests of their citizens involved in it. It may become advisable for us to co-operate with other com mercial powers in promoting the rights of rade and residence in the Congo valley free rom the influence or political control of any one nation. In view of the frequency of invi tations from foreign governments to partici pate in social and scieitic congresses for the discussion of important matters of general concern, I repeat the suggestion of my last meesage, that provision be made for the exercise of discretionary power by the executive in appointing delegates to ?nch conventions. Specialists are ready to serve the national interest in such capacity, without personal profit or other compensation than the defrayment of expenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual appropria tion woul.t suffice to meet 

BKSTBIOTIONS UFON TBADE. 1 have alluded in my previous message to the injurious and vexatious restrictions suf fered by our trade in tbe Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whose natural outlet for its great national trade iu coffee is in and through the United States, imposes a heavy export duty upon that product. A like narrow policy is pursued iu other Ameri can countries. Our petroleum exports are hampered in Turkey and in other Eastern ports by restrictions as to storage, and by onerous'taxation. The free outward movement of our great food product is in Bomo quarters clogged with like impedimenta For these mis chiefs adequate relief is not always provided by reciprocity treaties like that with Hawaii or tbat lately negotiated with Mexico, and now awaiting the action of tbe senate. It is advisable to provide some measure of equitable relation with the governments which discriminate against our own. If, for example, the execu tive wer9 empowered to apply to Spanish ves sels from Cuba and Porta Kico the same rules of treatment and scales of prices for technioal faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes iu the Antilles, a resort to that course might not be batren of good resnlts. A dis cretionary authority to forbid the importation of articles of consumption injurious to health might be advantageously exercised in our deal Lngilhth countries that discriminate against our food products. WAR AND TOTS NAVY. THE INDIANS MOSTLY QUIET. Fyom the report of the secretary of war it will be seen tbat in only a single instance has there been any disturbance of the quiet condi tion of our Indian tribes. A raid was made from Mexico into Arizona by a small party of Indians, which waB pursued by Gen. Crook into tbe mountainous regions from whioh it bad come. It is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur, and that the Indian tribes which have for many years dis turbed the West will hereafter remain in peaceable submission. STATE MILITIA ENCOUBAGED. On several occasions during the past year officers of the arnly have, at the request of State authorities, visited these military eu campments for inspection of troops. From the reports of those offioers I am induced to believe that the encouragement of the State militia organization by the National govern ment would be followed by very gratifying re sults and would afford it, Jn sudden emer gencies, tbe aid of a large oody of volunteers educated »in tbe performance of military du ties. AN EXPOSED SEAOOAST. I again call your attention to the present condition of our extended seacoast, upon which are So many large cities whose wealth and im portance to the country would, in time of war, invite attack from mod ern armored ships, against which our a-yinting defensive works could give no ade quate protection. Those works were built be fore the introduction of modern heavy rifled guns into maritime warfare and if they are not put in an efficient condition, we may easily be subjected to humiliation by a hostile power jrreatly inferior to ourselves. As germane to this subjeot I your attention to the im- Sfanaee.of Defective Page rtance pert® ctingour submarine torpedo The boasS fvthorfaed bv the fcwt oOn- ,S /"\jfr rJ*-"A-''iT gross to report on the mettictfB for the .manufacture. heavy ordnance, and adapted to*, ihodern watfare, has vis ited the principal iron aud' steel works in this country and in Europe. It is hoped that ite report will be soon made, and that congress will thereupon be disposed to provide suitable facilities and plans for -the manufacture of such guns as are now imperatively needed. The secretary of the navy reports that, under the,authority of the acts of Aug. 5,1882, and March 3, 1883, the work of strengthening our navy by the construction of modern vessels has been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers are in progress of construction—the Chicago, of 4.500 tons displacement, and the Boston and Atlantic, each 012,ouu tons, xney are to oe built of ateel, with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed by law, and in combination of speed, endurance, and armament are ex pected to compare favorably with the best un armed war vessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the Dolphin, to be constructed of similar materials, is intended to serve as a fleet dispatch boat. Tbe double-turreted monitors Puritan, Amphi trita and Terror have been launohed on 'the Delaware river, and a contract has been made for tne supply of their machinery. A similar vessel, the Monadnock, has been launohed in California. The naval advisory board and the secretary recommend the completion of the monitors, tbe construction of four gunboats, and also of three steel vessels liko the Chicago, Boston and Dolphin, as au important measure of material defense. 

INTEBIOB WATEBWAYS. The secretary urges the immediate oreation of an interior fast line of water ways across tbe peninsula of Florida, along tbe coast from Florida to Hampton Roads, between the Chesapeake bav and Delaware river, and through Cape Cod. I feel bound to impress upon the attention of congress the necessity of cSntinued progress in the construction of the navy. The condition of the publio treasury, as I have already intimated, makes the pres ent au auspicious time for putting this branch of the service in a state of efficiency. It is no part of our policy to create aud maintain a navy able to* cope with tbat of the other great powers of the world. We have no wish for foreign conquest, and the peace which we have eo long enjoyed is in no seeming danger of interruption' yet onr naval strength shonld be made adequate for the de fense of our harbors, the protection of our commercial interests, and the maintenance of our national honor—a proposition from which no patriotic citizen can withhold hiB assent THE TREASURY. A. GBATHTING EXHIBIT. The report of the secretary of the treasury gives a full and interesting exhibit of tho tinancial condition of the-country. It shows that the ordinary revenues from alt sources for the fiscal year ended June 30,1883, amounted to $398,287,581.05, whereof there was re ceived from customs, $214,706,496.93 from internal revenue, $144,720,368.95 trom sale of public lands, $7,955,864.42 from tax on circulation and deposits of national banks, $9,111,008.85 from profits on coinage of bullion deposits and assays, $4,460,205.17 from other sources, $17,333,637.60.

In iby judgment the latter oouras is far preferable. I commend to your attention the very Interesting and thoughtful suggestions on this subjeot wiuoh appear in the secretary's report The objections which he urges against the acceptance of .any other securities than the obligations of the govern ment itself as a foundation for national bank circnlation seem to me insuperable. For ad verting the threatened contraction, two courses have been suggested, either of which is prob ably feasible. One is the issuance of new bonds, having many years to run, bearing a low rate of interest and exchangeable upon specified terms for thoee now outstanding. Th other course, which commends itself to my own judgment as the better, is the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circnlation and permitting banks to issue notes for an amount equal to 90 per cent of the mar ket value, instead of, as now, the face value of deposited bonds. I agree with the secretary in the belief that the adoption of this plan will afford the neoessary rehef. THE 

TBADE DOXILAB. The trade dollar was coined for the purposes of trade in countries where silver passed at its value, ascertained by its weight and finness. It never had a legal tender quality. Large numbers of these coins entered, how ever, into the volume of our currenoy by common consent Their circulation in domestic trade haff now ceased, and they have become a disturbing element They should not longer be permitted to embarrass our cur rency system. I recommend that provision for their reception by the treasury and mints as bullion at a small percentage above the cur rent market prices of silver of like fineness. CUSTOMS DISTBICT8. The secretary of the treasury advises a com bination of certain of the customs districts of the couctry, and suggests that the president be vested with such power in relation thereto as is now given him in respect to collec tors of internal revenue by Sea 3131 of the revised statutes. The statistics on this subject, which are cootaiued in his report, furnish of themselves a strong argument in defense of his views. Al the adjournment of congress the number ol internal revenue collection districts was 126. By executive orders dated June 25, 1883,1 directed tbat certain of these districts be con solidated The result has been a reduction of one-third their number, which at present is but eighty-tbree. 

POSTOFFICE AFFAIRS. A PBOMISING STATE OF FINANCES. The report of the postmaster general con tains a gratifying exhibit of the condition and prospects of this interesting branch of the public service committed to his care. It ap pears that on June 30, 1883, the whole nnin ber of postoffioes was 47,863, of which 632 were established during the previous fiscal year. The number of offices operating under the system of free delivery was 154. At these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to $4,195,230.52, a sum exceeding by $1,021,894.01 tho entire cost of the carriers' service in the country. The rate of postage on drop letters passiug through these offices is now fixed by law at two cents per half ounce or fraction thereof. In offices where the carrier system has not been abolished the rate is only half as large. It will be remembered that in 1863, whou free delivery was first established by law, the uniform single rate of postage upon local let ters was one cent, and so it remained uutil 1872, when in those oities where carrier serv. ice was established it was increased to defray tbe expense of such service. It seems to me that the old rate may now with pro priety be restored, and that, too, even at a risk of diminishing for a time, at least, re ceipts from postage upon local letters. I can Bee no reason why that particular class of mail matter should be held accountable for the en tire cost of not only its own collection and de livery but the collection and delivory of all other classes, and I am confident, after full consideration of the subject, that the re duction of the rate would be followed by such a growing volume of business as to occasion but slight and temporaiy loss to tho revenue of the postoffice. POSTAL TELEGBAPH NOT DESIBED. The postmaster general devotes much of bis report to the consideration in its various aspects of the relation of the government to the telegraph. Such reflection as I have been able to give the subject sinoe my last annnal message has not led me to change the view which I then expressed, in dissenting from the recommendation of the postmaster general, that the government assume the same control over the telegraph whioh it has always ex ercised over the mails. Admitting that its au thority in the premises be as ample as hae evei been claimed for it, it would not, in my judgment, be a wise use of tbat amboritv to purchase or assume tht Sontrol of existing telegraph lines, or to con struct others with a view of entering into gen eral competition with private enterprise. The objections which may ne justly urged against either of these projects and. indeed, against any system which would require an enormous increase in the civil service, do not, however, apply to some of the plans which have lately Eas 1,642,199 12 1,557,800 88 1,478,940 49 901,303 aa 521,059 51 208,696 78 2,476,790 20 863,209 80 167,437 77 District of Colum bia....

Hitherto the surplus, as rapid ly as it'lias accumulated, has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt As aresalt, the only bonds now outstanding which are re deemable at tho pleasure of the government are the 3 per cents, amounting to $305,000,000: 4*2 per cents, amonnting to ^^oo,uuo,uuu and the $737,000,000 4 per cents are not payable until 1891^nd 1907 respectively. If the etirpluB snail Hereafter ne as large as the treasury estimates now indicate the 3 per cent bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before any of the 4^ per cents can be called The latter at tbe same rate of accumula tion of surplus oan be paid at matur ity, and the moneys requisite for tho redemption of the 4 per cents will be in the treasury long before these obligations become payable. There are cogent reasons, however, why the national indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguished. Ohief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. REDUCING THE BEYENUE. In a communication to congress^ at its last session I recommended that all excise be abol ished except those relating to distilled spirits, and that a substantial reduction also be made in the revenues from customs. A statute has since been enacted by which the annual tax and tariff reoeipts of tbe government have been cut down to the' extent of at least fifty or sixty millions of dollars. While I have no doubt tbat still further reduc tions may be wisely made,-1 do not advise tbe adoption at this session of any measures for a largo diminution of the national- revenues. The results of the legislation of last session of congreBSthave not as yet become sufficiently apparent to iustify any radical revision or sweeping modifications of existing law. In the interval which must elapse before the effects of the act of March 3, 1883, can be definitely ascertained, a portion, at least, of this surplus revenues may be wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabilitating our navy and providing defenses for the protection of our harbors. This is a matter to which I shall again advert Immediately associated with the financial subjects just discussed is the import ant question* What, legislation is needed re garding the national currency? The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit hi the treas ury to support the national bank circulation ia about $350,000,000 nearly $200,000,000 of this amount consists of 3 per cents, which, as already stated, are payable at, the meantime the surplus minished. The, probable effect of stach an extensive retirement of tbe securities which are the baaia of the national bank circulation would be such a contraction of the volume of the currency as to produce grave commercial embarrassment How can the danger be obvi ated? The most effectual plan, and one whose 'adoption at' the earliest practical opportunity I shall heartily approve^ has already been indicated. If the reve nues of the next four years shail kept substantial!* domuiensarats with the ex- rovoked public comment and discussion. It been claimed, for example, that congress might wisely authorise the postmaster general to contract with some private person or corporation for the transmission of messages at specified rates and under government supervision. Various such schemes, of the same general nature but widely differing in their stecial characteristics.- have been sug gested in the public prints, and the ar umeuta by which they have been supported and op posed have doubtless attracted' your attention. It is likely that the whole subject will be con sidered by you at the present session. In the nature of things it involves eo many questions of detail that your deliberations would prob ably be aided" slightly, if at all, by any par ticular suggestions which I might cow submit. I avow my belief, however, that the govern ment should be authorized by law to exercise court supervision over interstate telegraph communication, and I express tho hope that for attaining that end some measure be devised which will receive your approbation. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BEGULATION OF FEES. The attorney general criticizes in his report the provisions of the existing law fixing tbe fees of jurors aud witnesses in the federal courts. The provisions are chiefly oontained in the act of February 26, 1853, though some of them were introduced into the a^t from statutes which had beea pasted many years previous. It is mani fest that such compensation as might, when these laws were enacted, have been just and reasonable, would in many in stances be justly remanded at the present day as inadequate. I concur with the attorney gen eral in the belief that the statutes should be revised by which these fees are regulated. So, too, should be the laws to regulate the com pensation of district attorneys and marshals. They should be paid wholly *bv salary, instead of in part by fees, as is now" the case. The change would prove to be a measure of econ omy, and would discourage the institution of nee'dieas and oppressive legal proceedings, which it is to be feared have in some instauces been conducted for the mere sake of persoual gain. 

INTEHIOR DEPARTMENT. EVILS TO BE BEMEDIED. Much interest and varied information is con tained in tbe report of tbe seoretary of the interior. I particularly call your attention to his presentation of oertain phases of the Indian question, to his recommendations for the repeal of the pre-emption and timber cul ture acts and far more stringent legislation to prevent frauds under the pension Jaws. The statutes which prescribe the definition and pun ishments of crimes pertaining to pensions, could doubtless be made more effective by certain amendments and additions, which are pointed out in the secretary's reporf. I have" previ ously referred to the alarming state of illiter acy in certain portions of the country, and again submit for the consideration of congross whether some federal aid should not be extended to public Drimarv education wherever ade quate provision therefor has not already been made. UTAH. The Utah commission has submitted to the secretary of the interior its second annual re port As a result of its labors supervising the recent election in that Territory, pur suant to the act of March 22, 1882, it appears that the persous by that act disqualified, to the number of about 12,000, were excluded from the polls. This fact, how ever, affords little cause for congratulation, and I fear that it is far from indicating auy real and substantial progress toward tbe extir pation of polygamy. All of the members of the legislature are Mormona There is grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with the practices that this government is seek ing to suppress, and that i's effort in that re gard will be more likely to encounter their opposition than receive their encouragement and support Even if this view shonld happily be erroneots, the law of schools the conveyance of property, the administration of laws, or.the enforcement of 1 contracts—-none indeed for the punishment of criminals except tain cubtomB, suoh as are afforded by oer- commerce and navigation acts. The resources of Alaska, especially in fur, •?. inines and lumber, are considerable in extent and capable of large development, while its geo graphical situation is one of political andxom mercial importance. The promptings of inter est, therefore, as well as considerations of honor and good faith, demand the immediate estab lishment of civil government in that Territory. BAILWAT8. Complaints have lately been numerous, and urgent that certain corporations controlling in Whole or part tbe facilities for the inter-state carriage of merchandise by the great railways of the country have resorted in thQir dealings with the'public to divers measures unjust and oppressive in their character. In some instances the State governments have attacked and suppressed these evils, but in others they have been unable to af ford adequate relief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are imposed upon them by tbe federal constitution. The question whether the national government may lawfully interfere in tbe premises, and what, if any, supervision of control it ought to exer cise,'is one which merits your careful consid eration. While we oannot fail to recog nize tbe importance of the vast rail way systems of the country, and their great and beneficial influence upon the development of our material wealth. We Bhould, on the otlrer hand, remember that no individual corporation ought to be invested with absolute power over the interest of any other citizen or class of citizens. The right of thoBe railway corporations to any profitable re turn upon tneir investment ana to reasonao freedom in their regulations must bo recognized, but it seems only just that, so far as its constitutional authority will permit^ con gress should protect people at large in their interstate traffic against an act of injustice which State governments are powerless to prevent FOBEST PKESEBVES. In my last annnal message I called attention to the necessity of protecting by suiiable legis lation the forests situated upon the publio do main. In mauy portions of tbe West the pur suit of general agriculture is only made prac ticable by resort to irrigation. While success Ail irrigation wonld be impossible without the aid afforded by forests in contributing to the regularity and constancy of the supply of water. During the past year severe suffering and great loss of property have been occa sioned by profuse floods, followed by periods of unusually low water many of the great rivers of the country these irregularities were, in gzeat measure, caused by the removal from about the sources of tbe streams in question of the timber by which the water supply had been nourished and protected. The preserva tion of such portions of the forests on tbe na tional domain as essentially contribute to the equable flow of important "water courses is of the highest consequence. Important tributaries of the Missouri, the Columbia and the Sas katchewan, rise in the mountains of Montana, now the northern boundary of the United States, between the Eiackfeet and Flathead In dian reservations. This region is unsuitable for settlement, but upon the rivers which flow from ir, depends in the future the agricultural development of a va^t tra.-t of country. The attention of congress is called to the necessity of withdrawing from tbe public Bale this part sf the public domain, and establishing there a forest preserve. The industrial exhibitions which have been held in the United States during the present year attracted the attention of many foreigu countries, where the annonncement of those enterprises had been made public through the foreign representatives of this government Tbe Southern exhibits at Louisville were largely attended by the exhibitors of foreign countries, notwithstanding the absence of any professional character in those undertak ings. The centennial exposition to be held next year at New Orleans, in commemoration of the century of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the United States, bids fair to meet with like gratifying success. Under the act of congress of the 10th of February, 1883, declaring that exposition to be national and international in its character, tho foreign governments with which the United States maintains relatione, have been invited to participate. The promoters of this important undertaking have already reoeived assurances of the lively interest it has excited abroad. The report of the commissioner of the District of Columbia is herewith trans mitted. I ask for it your eareful attention, es pecially for those portions which relate to as sements for taxes and water supply. TI1E 

CIVIL SERVICE. WOBKINGS OF THE LAW. The commissioners appointed under the act of Jan. 16, 1883, entitled "An act to regulate and improve tbe civil service of the United States," entered promptly npon the discharge of their duties. A series of rules framed in ac cordance with tho spirit of the statute was approved and promulgated by the president. In some particulars where in they seemed defective those rules were subsequently amended. It will be perceived that they discountenanced any polit ical or religious teBts for admission to the offices of the public service to which the statute relates. The statute related in its original form to the classified clerkships in tbe several exec utive-departments at Washington, numbering about 5,600, and to similar positions in the customs districts and postoffioes where as many as fifty persons aro employed. A classi fication of these positions, analogous to that ex isting in the Washington offices, was duly made before the law went into effect Eleven customs districts and twenty-threa poatoffices were thus brought under the immediate operation of the statute. The annnal report or the civil service commission, which will soon be submit ted to congress, eunder whioh the commissioners have been acting, should be made more effective by tbe incorpor ation of some such measures as they recom mend and as were included in bill No. 2,238 on the calendar of the senate at its last session. I am convinced that polygamy is so strongly intrenched in the Territory of Utah tbat it is profitless to attack with tbe state weapons whioh constitutional legislation provide. I fa vor, therefore, the repeal of the act upon whioh the government depends, the assumption by tbe national legislature of entire political control of the Territory and the establishment of a commission with such powers and duties as ihall be delegated to it by law. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF AGRIC OLTOBK is accomplishing much in the direction of the agricultural development of the country, and the report of the commissioner giving the results of his investigations and experiments, wQl be found inter esting and valuable. At his instance a convention of thosQ interested in the cattle in dustry of tbe country was lately held at Ohicaga The prevalence of pleuro-pneu monia and other oontagious diseases or ani mals was one of the chief topics of dis cussion. A committee of the convention will invite your co-operation in investigat ing the causes of these diseases, and pro viding methods for "their prevention and cure. I trust that congress will not fail at its present session to put Ala Aa under the protection of laws. Its people have repeatedly remonstrated against onr neglect to afford them the main tenance and protection expressly guaranteed by the terms of^he treaty, wbereby that territory was oeded Uy. the United States. For sixteen years (hey have pleaded in tain IK that which theysbould havct received without no Jaw for ask the of th* /Mabt the envbort will doubtless afford the meas­ ure of a more.definite judgment than I am now prepared to express as to the merits of the new system. I am persuaded that its effects^ have ttius far proved beneficial. Its practicable methods appear to be adequate for tbe ends proposed, and there has been no serious diffi culty in carrying them into effect Since the 16th of July last no person, so far as I am aware, has been appointed to the publio serv ice in the classified portions thereof at any of (lie departments or at any of the postoflices and customs districts above named, except hose certified by the commission to be compe tent in the basis of the examination held in conformity to rules. 

MISCELLANEOUS. THE PBESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION. At the time when the present executive en tered upon his office, his death, removal, resig nation or inability to discharge his dnties wonld have left the government without a constitu tional head. It is possible, of course, that a similar contingency may again arise, unless tne wisdom oi congress shall provide against its recurrence. The sen ate, at its last session, after full onsideration, uassed an act relating to this subject which will now, I truBt, commend itself to tlia approval of both houses of congress. The claus3s of the constitution, upon which must depend any law regulating the presidential succession, presents also for solution other questions of para mount importance. These questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase "ina bility to discharge the powers and duties of the said office." Our law providing, that when the president ehall suffer from such inability, tho presidential office shall devolve upon the vice president who must himself, un der the circumstances, give place to such offer as congress mav by law appoint to act as president. I need not here set forth numerous and interesting inquiries which are suggested by these words of the constitution. They were fully stated in my first communication to con gress, and have since been the subject of fre-" auont deliberations in that body. It is greatly to be hoped that these momentuous questions will find speedy solution, lest an emergency should arise when longer delay will be impos sible, and any determination, albeit the wisest may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm. For the reasons fully stated in my last aunual message, I repeat my recommendation that congress propose an amendment to tbat provision of the constitution which prescribed that the formalities for the enactmont of laws, whereby in respect to bills for the appropria tion of public moneys, the executive may be enabled,while giving his approval to particu lar items, to interpose his veto as to such others as do not commend themselves to his judg ment THE

ABTHUB. WASHINGTON, D. C., DJC. 3, 1883. An Interest!ne Patent Suit. An interesting case, involving a very in» genious and economical device, has just been decided by the courts, the particulars of which will bear brief mention. Nelson Lyon of Albany, N. Y., recovered Judg ment of $8,447.10 besides cost and interest against 0.1*. Fisher & Co., in the United 8tatea Circuit Court, at Detroit, Mich., ior an itifriugment of what is kno^va to the trade as Lyon's Patent Metallic el Stiffen er. This contrivance is ne of the most use ful of modern inventions, and has achieved a remarkable sale —over three-quarters of a miilion dollars worth, the testimony in the present su't shewed having been disposed of since the patent was granted,' being a grand total ot 273 478 pounds, or 3,883,000 pairs. At ote time the Attorney General of the United 8tates declared the Lyon patent in valid, simply on account of aa informality in the application, but this waa afterward corrected by the Commissioner of Patents, in accordance with a special act of Congress authorizing such correction. Fisher's main improvement consisted in elongating the rcrew-hole fastening the plate, and, as de fendants they based their main defence in trvinr to show tha special act of ood£roB waa ill constitutional and that plaintiff's in vention was not new. Action was com menced in May, -1880, a perpetual. injunc tion was obtained in December following and the case was referred to a master to as certain the profits made by defendant and f the loss sustained by Mr. Lyon.
