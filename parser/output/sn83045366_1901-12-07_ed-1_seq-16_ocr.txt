Sworn and subscribed to before me this 6th day of December, 1901. C. A. TULL.ER, Notary Public, Hennepin County. ALL RECORDS BROKEN. The Minneapolis Journal <,ets away ahead of its marvelous record of a year ago by running 161 columns more advertising in November, 1901, than in Novem ber, 1900. In November, 1901, The Journal carried 1277 columns of adver tising, this being 16| per cent more than the daily and Sunday issues combined of The Journal's nearest Minneapolis competitor. Advertisers prove the circulation of The Journal by using it more than any other paper. The Journal's circulation for November, 1901, averaged 51775 copies daily, or 4,230 daily more than for November, 1900. Pernicious Activity Quite naturally the public became curious when Judge Mills, chairman of the Minnesota railway commission sud denly evinced so much interest in the question of federal control of railways, t^;u -ially as he has never showed very much interest in the state control of rail ways. But the public reflected that Governor Van Sant had already stirred up a sensation by proposing to do what can be done at once to stop or nullify the great railway merger. The public then thought it had located the rodent. It suspected that Judge Mills might be pounding the tom-tom for federal control, seeing that action toy the state was near et hand. Now the judge has taken the second step. It serins that his interest in fed- eral regulation of railroads waxes hotter just in proportion as it begins to look as If the state had the merger on the hip. In fact the judge has become tremendous ly interested in the question. So he de vises the junket to Washington on the part of the Minnesota railway commission to confer with tho obsolete anf impotent interstate eommer>ce commission, He Invited Governor Van Sant and Attorney General Douglas to accompany the com mission. But, if they did not wink the other eye, they, at least, promptly de clined with profuse regrets. No, thank you, no diversions for them. Meanwhile, the friends of the railway merger are making an insidious campaign, a still hunt, to underline adverse public opinion. Social and tot., :ness pressure is daily being brought to bear, as s<cores of prominent men of 'Minneapolis and St. Paul can testify. An effort is being made to influence business men to pooh-pcoh all talk aibout the dangers of consolidation of the two great northern transcontinen tal systems ' and, by cajolery, convince them that, aj level-headed business men, they should favor the consolidation. It is no secret that a determined effort has been made to bring powerful pressure to bear on the only St. Paul daily paper that has a mind of its own regarding the merger, to seal its lips. The warning of all this is for the peo ple to stand firm; to be aware of at tempted diversions from the task of at tacking the merger at once with the •weapons that are at hand, and to fortify themselves in their first conviction that the great consolidation is all wrong. There are some cynics who think the coincidence of a scarcity of street cars and the low stage of water in the river Is remarkable. A Lesson From Webster Washington correspondence of The Journal indicates that the New Eng land and other eastern members of congress will oppose measures designed to promote irrigation in the arid regions of the west, for the narrow and selfish reason that they wuuld rather see the proceeds of the pub lic land sales go into the general revenue fund; where they are available for ap propriations that may be spent in New England, instead of into an irrigation fund which would all be spent in the west. If Now England's statesmen are really so narrow as this they need to be re minded of Webster and the broad doctrine of the welfare of the whole country that he so well expounded in the reply to Hayne. Hayne had asked "What interest has South Carolina in a canal in Ohio?" Web ster replied: Sir, we narrow-minded people of New Eng land do not reason thus. Our notion of things is entirely different. W« look upon the states not as separated but as united. * * • In whatever is within the proper sphere of the constitutional power of this government ye look upon the states as one. We do not impose geographical limits to our patriotic feeling or regard; we do not follow rivers and mountains, und lines of latitude to find boucdartes beyond which public Improve ments do not benefit us. • • • Sir, if a rail road or canal, beginning in South Carolina and ending in South Sarollna, appeared to mo to be of national importance and national magnitude, believing as I do that the power of government extends to works of that de scription, If I were to stand up here and ask, what interest has Massachusetts in a railroad in South Carolina I should not be willing to face my constituents. If the eastern members of congress will I approach the Irrigation question in the spirit of a Webster and find that it is not !of national magnitude or national im portance and ehall, therefore, oppose ap propriations for irrigation, no one has a right to eomplaln that their course has been narrow and sectional, however much he may differ with their conclusion. But we hope that no eastern congressman will paraphrase Hayue's query and ask, "What interest has my state in an irrigation ditch in Colorado?" W. J. Bryan has an editorial in The Commoner ->n "The Yellow Peril," advo cating the exclusion of the Chinese, Jap- ' anese and Filipinos from the United States. So far as concerns the Chinese, most people will agree with Mr. Bryan, but It is laughable to find him insinuat ing that the plutocrats waut Chinese help for domestic service because they do not have to pay it so much as American ser vant girls. A first-class Chinese house servant will not work for less than from $30 to $40 a month and the poorest of them demand more than native women servants get. The Course of Business Of more than ordinary importance to the business world was the president's message. As a favorable factor it was quite the feature of the week. It was not to be expected that it would be other than an able paper, nor that it would lack anything of comprehensiveness. No one doubted that every subject would be han dled with force and decision. It must needs have been such a document to be characteristic. But it may be fairly ques tioned whether the majority of the con servatives among the business men of our country have heretofore felt themselves as in any degree represented by the per sonality of our new chief executive. We have followed Roosevelt the politician, the writer, the soldier, the man of many parts but in all that has been said of his remarkable versatility and exceptional abilities no one has ever advanced con servatism as a Rooseveltian quality. In deed, If there was ever a. lurking fear that he might fall short of full rounded-out fitness for his high office, it arose solely from knowledge of his predominating qualities of youthful force and impetuos ity. It remained for his message to show Lirn possessed of conservatism in a marked and surprising degree, and those questions having a commercial bearing were sto strongly yet delicately handled as to leave no doubt that the business inter ests of the country will be carefully guarded in any material changes of policy that may arise under his administration. Early in the week nervousness devel oped in the money market over a renewal of gold shipments, but only about $2,000, --000 went out and this proved to be the extent of the' movement. Pig iron has held the high range estab lished by the recent advance and interest now centers largely in the question of fu ture supplies. None can be had for De cember delivery except an occasional lot at a premium. The car shortage is still felt in the iron trade and in some de gree in all lines. Cotton had a sharp upturn based on the agricultural department's estimate of 9,674,000 bales for the season's yield, this being considerably under the lowest pri vate estimates. Dry goods prices have been maintained with general demand satisfactory. Seasonable weather has brought activity into the retail lines, and although it is yet early, there is already the bustle of a heavy Christmas trade. The one unfavorable feature is the diffi culty of getting prompt delivery of goods already ordered for holiday trade, owing to congested traffic. Bank clearings for the week were $2,478,151,606, of which $890,179,517 was in centers outside of New York. The stock market in general has been without material price changes. Profes sional traders favored a bull turn to fol low the president's message, but the mar ket has had to stand the slump in Amal gamted Copper, which has been striking new low points repeatedly and the bear ! ishness induced by the continued growth of public sentiment in the northwest against the Northern Securities company. Wheat started the week with an advance, ! worked to a range three cents higher and i held it. The gain was in great measure i responsive to increased strength in coarse 1 grains. Speculative interest was revived | and the market broadened greatly. Locally general trade was never bet ter and the volume of business never so i large. Local 'bank clearings have been | touching new high points for some time, ! and this week all previous records were I broken by figures of $22,583,244.32. This represents an increase of 45 per cent over the same week last year when the clear ings were $15,542,666.44. It is said that the Queen of Holland is hedged around and attended by a band of ten noble youths, each of whom was for merly passionately attached to her. Prince Henry may not be so bad after all. How would you feel if your wife were always attended by ten fellows who had proposed for her hand? The senile senate must have found Ponce de Leon's renewer of youth. Its committee on foreign affairs has already voted to recommend the adoption of the Hay-Paußcefote treaty. Hoar's Anarchist Colony Senator Hoar's scheme for the segrega tion of anarchists in insular retirement appears more rational the more one re fleccs upon it. It would not be an imi tation of England's penal colonies, for such disposition of her convicted ruffian ism grew out of the great lack of prison accommodations at home. The system lasted something more than half a cen tury, when the immigration of enterpris ing noncriminal classes into Australia brought about- the abandonment of the penal colony system and a great Aus tralian confederation has come into being in these latter days. Senator Hoar's idea is that anarchistic assassins are not deterred from the com mission of their crimes by the fear of punishment, even if it were instant death, and the multiplication of punishments would have no deterrent effect. There fore the most effective remedy would be the separation of the anarchists as a the Minneapolis journal. class from the rest of the world In some remote and desolate spot (an island would be preferable) where there Is no govern ment, and where the sect can carry out its theories and prevent any government from existing. Thus they would find their Utopia, their Icaria. The civilised powers could agree upon the locality and would send thither all their anarchists as they reveal themselves. Senator Hoar says it is time the anar chists had an object lesson and that the world had one also. "Let there be," said he, "a little inoculation of anarchy into the anarchist himself and let him have an anarchistic government among his fel lows." Our island of Guam has been sug gested as an appropriate place for this an archistic Utophia. There Is no doubt that a community of anarchists, in agreement that all rulers ought o be killed, and hav ing no incentive to engage in plots against hypothetical rulers, would soon get des perately tired of each other's society, and ultimately proceed to kill each other. Miss Goldman and Johan Most would find it very dull amusement mouthing their old anarchist orations to empty benches or distrait audiences. Your anarchist would find existence very stupid indeed, if he found that he could utter eulogies over the assassin of McKinley with the solid approval of his own community as was done in Chicago last night, with no fear of police Interference. As to the anarchist colony scheme it is almost probable that there would be a sufficient number of tender hearts in con gress to defeat such proposition. There has always been too much tender-hearted ness toward that class in this country, and they have in consequence multiplied. The president recommends stringent immigration laws to prevent the ingress of anarchists, which is all proper enough, but it will be remembered that Booth, Guiteau and Czolgolz were native Ameri cans. The president also recommends conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts over parties who kill or try to kill the president or any one in the line of succession to 'the presidency. A reso lution has been introduced in the senate providing for an investigation by the judiciary committee into the power of congress in this matter, and ascertain the expediency of giving congress greater power over anarchism than it now pos sesses. Many measures relating to this subject have already been introduced and others are in reserve, but for immediate use the giving of the federal courts jurisdiction over anarchists who make successful or unsuccessful attempts on the lives of our presidents or those in the line of the presidential succession, is certainly the best and most effective. The anarchist colony scheme is picturesque and taking, but it is possible that even the Isle of the Devil would have no terrors for a fully developed anarchist. Jonkheer Van Tets of Holland is run ning Miss Stone a close race in the dead and-dying list. A Colorado woman was so shocked by the scenes of slaughter she saw in the Chicago packing-houses that she is almost wholly paralyzed. Can anybody tell why women, and, for that matter, men, will make a spectacle of a charnel house? Madame Sarah Grand had the good sense to request to be spared from this part of Chicago's sights. The Good of Novel Reading In these columns last Saturday sympa thy was expressed with Andrew Lang's moan that the people read too many novels and too little of other forms of literature. It was pointed out that the continuous and unrelieved reading of fic tion has a tendency to enervate the mind and unfit it for serious reading, following the law of least resistance. This effect of over-much novel reading is likely to be confined chiefly to those who have had some familiarity with other forms of literature, but, devoting their energies chiefly to their dally occupations, find novel reading of a certain kind much easier than any reading that really fur nishes mental exercise. To the person who approaches the realm of literature on the frontier of the province of the novel it undoubtedly. is true that the light novel becomes a step ping stone to heavier literature. Almost any reading is better than none to begin with. Mr. Poole, the late Chicago libra rian and editor of Poole's Index, once said that it was a common thing for shop girls to come to the library and begin with Miss Southworth and then follow succes sively with E. P. Roe, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, and then some of the best histories and some of the best essays. Dr. Lyman Abbott says that a representative of the Ameri can News company told him that while ten or fifteen years ago he was chiefly selling a cheap, poor literature, to-day he found the greatest demand to be for the highest and best. And Dr. Abbott com ments: "It is a question what is the ulti mate effect of what we call sensational literature. That it sometimes degen- crates and deteriorates the mind, I do not doubt; but, on the whole, I believe that even the sensational literature teaches people to read, and when they have learned to read, they generally learn to read what is better, though very grad ually." Many are the sins of the yellow press; many its offenses against decency and morals, and we are sometimes horrified when we dwell on the mental fiber that we should think would be built up of such" food. How, we ask, can a man daily read and enjoy such melanges of atrociously displayed crimes and indecencies without becoming of a piece with that he reads? But remember that he who reads must think, at least a little, and that fifty or a hundred years ago the kind of people who now enjoy the yellow press did not read. The man who reads the New York Journal to-day may be graduated to the Post in a few years. It is not the intention in writing this to belittle the novel. It is a noble form of literature,- and we are sorry for the man who does not know the best novel ists. We would not even give the novel an inferior place. It is the use and abuse of the novel that we are considering. For the reader climbing up in literature it is good—he can scarcely get enough of it. For the man who is up it is good—'but he can get too much of it. The man who is building up a fortune can make good use of all the money he can get. For his son an abundance of money may be ruinous. The assistant auditor of Ramsey county has been sentenced to ten years in Still water for practicing commercial politics. With the Hennepin county sheriff under indictment for a similar reason, it begins to look as If this industry woujd soon be a waning one hereabouts. The "co-ed" must be losing her charm. Given their choice between a party at which the girls should be present and a stag party, the University of Chicago football men preferred the latter. Chile Has Visions The Monroe doctrine—a doctrine sup ported by the United States of Nortb America for the protection of the indepen dent states of Latin America, has, iv all probability, saved some of those states from European conquest. It is the only thing that stands between some of them now and absorption—by Germany, say. Nevertheless, outside of Brazil and cer tain classes in Mexico, we have very few friends from the Rio Grande to Patagonia. Neither are we so highly esteemed in that region as we esteem ourselves. We get no thanks tor what we have done, we are feared for what we are, and we are sus pected for what we may be. Contrary as it may seem to our own peculiar ideas of the fitness of things, the Latin American states are not content to bask in the sun shine of our greatness, glad to be left to comparative international obscurity. All the plans and visions of national great ness are not confined to ourselves. That long, narrow strip of country be tween the mighty Andes and the wide Pa cific, the home of a virile and aggressive rate, has visions of a great future, not only for itself, but for South America. Little Chile, with scarce 4,000,000 people, already sees a vision of all South America conquered or united (by her into a feder ated nation. To Mexico she assigns the Central American republics and even holds out the hope that in great days to come the vigorous soldiery reared at the bases of the Andes will regain for the Aztec republic all the lands wrested from Mexico by the United States. The Chileans are undoubtedly the most ambitious and hardy of the South Ameri can peoples. They are proud, Irritable and truculent. They are always looking for trouble; always they have a dispute with Peru, the Argentine or Bolivia. It Is no secret that at the first opportunity Chile will seek to throw her boundaries across the Andes to include the wide pampas of the 'Argentine. War between the two countries is even now imminent, and it is asserted that Chile has 800,000 well armed soldiers trained by German officers. The riches of the province of Tarapaca, formerly belonging to Peru, are counted upon to maintain the fleet and the army. All in all, according to the re ports that come up from South America and from the Pan-American congress, Chile Is getting ready to become the mili tary state par excellence. Already the Chileans and other South Americans are talking about the decadence of the Ameri cans. We are, they say, becoming soft, and fond of luxury. The limit of our ex ercise is a ride in a Pullman car; we are a nation of money seekers and servile ■wealth worshipers. Money is everything ■with us; the human virtues and quali ties no longer count. But down there in the valleys of the Andes is a race that can rid© and shoot and fight; that is tough and energetic and virile and untouched by luxury—full of national pride—restless with ambition; that 'from its mountain tops casts greedy eyes over a continent ana impatiently waits for the moment to descend to the conquest. This is the people that will restore the ancient splendor of th.c Latin races; this Is the people that will check the expansion of the Anglo-Celts. Here there is no grovelling before the advance of the North American republic; here is a state that cares for no protec tion 'but that of its own arms. The rest of South America is not so martial as Chile, not so ready to fight the world, but it loves us little and though it is continu ally In hot water with Chile the Mexican correspondent of the Boston Herald as serts that it -would prefer the rule of Chile to that of the United States. In Mexico sentiment is divided. Presi dent Diaz is very friendly to the United States, but there is a powerful pro-Span ish element. The Indians, who constitute a majority of the population, also have a rather kindly feeling for America, and cf late there has !begun a reaction in the clerlc.il party in our favor. We confess to a certain degree of ad miration for Chile. We admire her in dependent and audacious spirit, and we can understand the Pan-Latin attraction which may yet draw together the states of South America into that United States that was the dream of Boliver. When all the South. American states have been re generated by war and bloodshed; and they have at last developed that "political or ganism," which a speaker at the Pan- American congress said they unfortunate ly lacked at their ibirth, in contradistinc tion to the United States, they may yet ■federate. But for all her vim and robber courage we see dire- days ahead for Chile. Did some one say the Mississippi river is going dry? Well, who cares, just so the forests are hacked down, every tree of them, as fast as possible? A Novel Campaign We are not so much perturbed over our own colonial war as the British are over theirs, and we have settled down to it as one of the continuous jobs of civilization. We have recovered from' the notion wo once had that there would come a certain day when it could be announced that peace prevails throughout the Philippines in the sense that it prevails at home. We now expect a daily measure of fights and skir mishes, the h"re of insurrection stamped out in one place only to be lit in another. But we take it all just as we take the annual round of duties in the struggle of life —always there is something to be done. That is why we are not concerned over the hell of war that is raging in Samar, and that Is why we fail to become ex cited when we learn that the insurrection in Laguna and Batangas provinces, in Lu zon, is so full of life that General Chaffee has sealed the ports, laid an embargo on trade and refused to pay further rent for barracks because the money was going into the treasury of the insurgents. When we read in the cablegrams from Manila that General Smith is taking the very limit of drastic measures for the suppression of Lukban, we do not have an access of maudlin sympathy for the un fortunate people of Samar. We have Just settled down to see this job through and we are not finding fault with our gen erals for adopting measures that will end an intolerable condition* oX Insurrection and disorder. Still we cannot help feeling a great interest in the outcome of Smith's unique method of procedure in a country where the entire population is opposed to the Americans, but from time to time puts on the guise of tinigo and puts off that of the 

SATURDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 7, 1901 soldier. The problem is to divide the sheep from the goats, to mass on the one hand the enemies of the Americans, to mass on the other —not the {riehds (for we have none there) of the Americans —but those who really desire peace. Naturally the amigos, professedly, are numerous in the garrisoned towns; yet it is no secret that information and supplies and reve nue go from those towns to the in surgents. Now General Smith has under taken to make these amigos either Join the insurgents or help the Americans. So he has ordered all the male adults of the towns and villages to the interior of tho island with instructions not to return unless they bring weapons, prisoners or information concerning the whereabouts of the enemy. If they prefer to stay out with insurgents, General Smith will know how to classify them. If they come back it will be at the price of doing something to advance the American cause. This plan Is the very reverse of the reconcen tratiw of Weyler and Kitchener. In South Africa the need is to withdraw the population from the country and thus destroy tho bases of the Boers. There is little difficulty there in distinguishing friends from enemies—the latter are In the field. In Samar the idea is to make all enemies show their colors. Sentimental theorists will be inclined to rage and weep over such a plan of cam paign, but we cannot sympathize with them. We are in the Philippines to stay and we must restore order. In Samar there are, strictly, no non-combatants ex cept women and children. All the men aro opposing us, passively or openly. It Is- a peculiar case and the measures must be adapted to it. After inspecting statement showing how many millions of dollars the lowa farmers have "cleaned" up this year, we under stand why there are no large cities in lowa. The farmers can. use the ground to better purpose. Another Supposition by Stead William T. Stead, editor of the English ■Review of Reviews, who is ever flagellat ing ,the present British government, and finds a keen satisfacton in conjuring up visions of what may come to pass if the jingoistic imperialism that now rules in Britain shall much longer continue in. the saddle, has had another dream. It is like unto the one he dreamed two months ago about the day when Britain shall seek ad mission to the American union. This time he sees America taking up .the sword for the freedom of Ireland, as it has so re cently done for the freedom of Cuba. Re ferring to John Redmond's mission to America to raise funds for the support of the new united Irish movement, Mr. Stead writes: He has now gone across the Atlantic to appeal for the support of the Irish who dwell in the greater Ireland beyond the sea. It is an interesting subject for speculation whether the time will ever come for Mr. Redmond to cross the Atlantic upon another mission—to appeul for the support of the American re public against the British government. * * * Before the bar of history England stands eon den:ned for a failure in Ireland only a few degrees less scandalous than that which stood to the discredit of Spain in the West Indies. * * * The Irish vote in the United States is powerful. The spirit of expansion strong; the memory of the swift and easy success v.h'.ch they achieved in Cuba dwells in the memory of the people. It may be. Who dreamed five years ago that the Philippines would ever be ours? Mr. Stead may be as good a prophet as any of' us. Yet nothing now seems more im probable than that the United States will ever draw the sword for Ireland. If we should be drawn into a war with Britain, and the Irish should rise; the terms of peace, granting that .the victory should be with us, might include independence for Ireland. But as for going to war to free Ireland, not even a majority of the Irish in America, first and second genera tions, would vote for such a rash under taking, however much it might appeal to their racial patriotism. Of course, there is and ever has been a firm and settled conviction in America that England has been both unwise and unjust in her dealings with Ireland from the days of Elizabeth to our own times. Ireland has been deliberately sacrificed to England's commercial Interests. Ireland's real troubles are commercial rather than political. Had not England thwarted the natural commercial and industrial devel opment of the Emerald Isle it might well have been as loyal to-day as Scotland, for it would have been a prosperous and pow erful part of the British economic sys tem. But for all Ireland's woes we are not likely to invite other woes for our selves in an effort ,to re&cue her from hers.

Little Journey to the Home of lle hcknh. See Genesis, xxlv. Some little time after the destruction of the wicked cities of the plain, Abraham, the grand old man of the desert, with his tents, camels and treasure, Journeyed southward till he arrived in the fertile country between Kadesli and Shur and sojourned at a place called Gerar. This was not so veiy long ago, the only chronicle of the event placing the date at 1898 B. C. Abraham at this time was an. hundred years old and as sturdy a speci men of manhood as could be found in the orient. It was during this sojourn at Gerar that Sarah his wife presented him with a son who after the usual ceremonies Incident to childbirth in those days was called Isaac. Abraham felt much elated over tins event and the Gerar News chronicled it in the usual manner with a sly hit at the patriarch which caused much laughter throughout Canaan where the old man. was popular as well as respected After this event Abraham journeyed into the land of the Philistines and dwelt at Beer-sheba in the land of Canaan. As he grew older he did not travel as much as In former years, but sat at the dorr of his tent watching the children play and the camels and other live stock grow and increase ih numbers. One day he awoke to the fact that he was an hundred and forty years of age and that Isaac his son was already a young man of 40—and still unmarried. ITe had not paid much attention to the boy heretofore but as he looked at him that day he saw that he was a sturdy youth and well favored. It was time for him to be settling down in life and taking to himself a wife. lie was determined that Isaac should not marry among the daughters of the Canaanites, for he was anx ious to keep the nationality line pure that it might inherit the promised blessing. As he sat in the shadow of his tent in th<» cool of the evening, the course to pursue was unfolded to him. lie called unto "his servant, the elder of his house that ruled over all he had" and made him swear an oath to fulfil the duty to be laid upon him of Journeying to a strange city of his own people to obtain a wife for his son Isaac. With old Eliezer, Abraham's word was law. Without more ado he took tpn camels wei! laden with provisions, together with presents for the prospective bride. Old Eliezer hardly pulled a re:n on his camels till he arrived at the suburbs of Haran, the city of the Moon-god. Here he dismounted and the camels, with much creak ing and groaning, kneeled for rest beside the ancient well. While Eliezer was facing the sunset and praying, there came from the city a bevy of young: maidens each bearing a water jar poised upon head or shoulder. Some of them looked at Eliezer and laughed at the old man's devotions end one of them shifting her gum, remarked:' "Pipe the old geezer from the desert at his devotions." But one of the maidens, very fair to look upon, did not take part in this persiflage. Eliezer looked upon her and was pleased. Sht, was no hothouse plant but had grown strong and graceful in the abundant air and sun shine. Her drapery half hid and half re vealed her perfect form. Eliezer moved to ward her and said: "Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher." Deftly lowering the jar she said: "Drink, my lord. And I will craw for thy camels also until they have done drinking.'" Eliezer looked earnestly upon the maiden and drew from his raiment a golc ring and a pair of bracelets. Pressing them upon hey, he asked: "Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?" The maiden tells the stranger about Bethuel her father, gives him some details of her family and assures him of an oriental wel come. Before Eliezer partakes of this hos pitality, however, he rehearses the purpose of his visit, tells of the wealth of his master and of his son Isaac. Then Rebeknh, after a household conference, is asked the fateful question: "Wilt thou go with this man?" And she replies: "I will go." • • • • • It is night at Lahai-roi and Isaac gazing out across the desert sees a familiar caravan creeping over the sandy plain from the north. He walks out to meet it. And Rebeknh descending from her camel, veiled herself and stood modestly before them while Eliezer reported to Isaac all that he had done. Then "Isaac brought her into her mother Sarah's tent and took Rebekah, and she be came his wife, and he loved her " I Questions Answered Curious—l noticed at the recent performance of "Barbara Frietohie" in this city two flags of different pattern which 1 supposed wera Confederate flags. One contained a white stripe through the middle of a red field, which I understand, was the regular Confederate flag. But I do not understand the red field, with blue, diagonal cross, with white stars on the blue. —The flag showing a red field with a white center was adopted by the Con federate States in 1861, and was first displayed on March 4 at the state housf in Montgomery, Ala., the day Lincoln was inaugurated in Washington. The other flag is the battle flag adopted by Johnson and Beauregard. Voter—How was the Hayes-Tilden electoral commission constituted? —It was made up of five members of the house of representatives, five senators and five justices of the supremo court. There were eight republicans in the commission and they refused to go behind the returns in the doubtful states, deciding in each instance in favor of the Hayes elec tors. C. R. S.—What are the Staked Plains and how did they get that name?— The terra is ap plied to the western plateau of Texas, ana comes from the equivalent Spanish "Llano Estacado," given on account of the re semblance the bare_ stems of the yucca tree bear to stakes. Prohibitionist —What are sumptuary laws? —They are laws designed to repress the ex penses of private citizens. Of late years "sumptuary laws" is a phrase that has been applied to any legal measure that is designed to prohibit the sale of an article, as, for in stance, of intoxicating beverages. Strictly speaking, a prohibition law is not a sumptu ary law, for it is not intended to repress the expenses of citizens but to keep something from being offered to them. Reciprocity—Have we ever had reciprocity with Canada?— There was a reciprocity treaty between Canada and the United States from 1854 to 1866. It was thought that it was too favorable to the Canadians and the United States canceled it as soon as it could under the terms of the agreement. The balance of trade toward the end of the period was very much In favor of Canada.* A person who has received without sub scription copies of a certain newspaper asks whether she can be held fur the paper al though she did not subscribe for it. It de pends en whether you aer*°pr. and use the offered paper. If you refuse it and do not use it you cannot be held. To take It is construed as intention of a desire to use, and/of course, to pay for It. Etiquette—To decide an argument will you please state whether or no it 13 proper to eat stewed peas as a course dinner with the fork or spoon?—lf there is anybody else at that dinner we would advise you to use a fork. If you are alone use a spoon and enjoy solid comfort. But never tell. Reader —What has the Olayton-Bulwer treaty to do with the isthmian canal, anyway? —Simply this, that Great Britain has always held that the treaty estopped the United States from building an isthmian canal on its own account. On the other hand Ameri cana have contended that the treaty only applies to a Tehuantepoc canal and had noth ing to do with Nicaragua and Panama, and also, that even If it had applied to them originally the whole trea'y was null because of an alleged violation by Great Britain of a part of It In occupying Belize, the occu pation of afcy part of Central America by either powe» being forbidden by the treaty. Gourmet—»fe it Welsh rare bit or rabbit?— Rabbit. J. S. T.—Has Canada a larger area than tho United States?— Yes, than che United States, exolusive of Alaska and the territory gained by the war with Spain. With them or with Alaska alone the United States is the larger. In Lighter Vein J. J. Hill's "Contribution." The great railway magnate who is Just now engaged in uniting three great railway systems under his own presidency has found time in tho midst of his labors to tell the magazine Success' readers "How to Get and Keep a Position." People wonder how men of large affairs, with every available ininute of their time engaged for some business pur pose, can find the time or tho spirit to sit down and write out their thoughts on a matter of so little concern to them as the one Mr. Hill has turned magazine contributor to tell us about. To gratify this wonder it becomes necessary to shatter a delusion. But for the sake of the truth it is permissible to shatter delusions. Very few of the ar ticles by the political and industrial mag nates that you see in magazines and the syn dicate editorials published by BMne newspa pers are actually written, as they purport to be, though they always have the author ity of the supposltlous writer. The magazine decides that it will, have an article by some famous man on some particular subject. It knows very well from hard experience that thorn is no likelihood that he will furnish it in the shape of so much manuscript. So a staff contributor, or some journalist cially engaged for the work, calls upon the great man, tell him what hie magazine wants, end explains that if he will grant the writer a few minutes talk on the subject the latter will write the article and return it to the magnate for his approval and signature. • If the man assigned to the task is at all nlev.-r lie will get the magnate's ideas on the sub ject in hand in a few minutes and will b i able to return in a day or two with a I article than the great man could ever hav«> written by himself, clearly expressing all th» original ideas that the interview brought out and backing them up with a mass of w<!l written matter wherein are expressed the rommon ideas on the subject in question. Tin* man who writes for the magazines In this manner may make a few changes In what ha 3 been written. Then he will attach his signa ture, the journalist turns in the copy and gets his check, the magazine gets Its story and the public is delighted to read the words of the great man. So everybody is happy. It would not be safe to say that all articles by men busy with absorbing affairs of the first magnitude are thus prepared, but it is safe to conclude that most of them are. Mr. Hill on Character Building. But whether he wrote it or somebody else—• ?nd it is hard to find signs of Mr. Hill's style in the article in question—it contains a lot of good advice for young men, though it is pretty much on the same lines as all such adviea: Work hard, don't fear out-of hours work, dress neatly, but never foppish ly, save your money, master the details of your task, cultivate good habits, impress your employer with a feeling that you aro working for him as well as for yourself. The plree of advice that sounds most like Mr. Hill Is that if your personality is not agree able change it. Mr. Hill will not have It that men are born agreeable or disagreeable and must remain in the way where they were born. In fact Mr. Hill thinks that nothing else can be acquired so easily as a good personality if a man has the mind and in clination to acquire it. "Never," he says, "let* a harsh or impolite personality be the weak link in the chain of your qualities. * • * A bad temper can be expurgated th« same as any other vice." The Appetite for Mngaxlnei. It is amazing what a host of magazines compete for the favor of the public and the advertiser and succeed, too. The magazliio field seems to be one that the trusts have not yet entered. There are almost as many different publishers of magazines as of the magazines themselves, though the same house often issues several magazines. Mure over, there is hardly a magazine that has a monopoly of any one field. Every class of readers is appealed to by a number of magazines. But all of them are under a powerful attraction to become general in, their nature. Kecently such periodicals as Public Opinion and the Literary Era, whli-fr formerly had a certain narrow field, hay« broadened out. The latter has dropped th« word "Literary" from its title and the for mer, which, not long ago, was largely made up of clippings from the newspaper editorirjl columns, now scarcely quotes them at all, Las special articles of its own and devotes much attention to the other magazines. But the public seems to be equal to the demand made upon its time and its money. The nioro magazines there are the more the people buy. lJrop into a news store about the first of th^ month, and the bights you irill see thera will detract from your wonder as to who reaui all the magazines. You will see men coma in and, in the most matter-of-fact way, buy five or six high-priced magazines, one or two weeklies, a technical or special publica tion of some kind, two or three newspapers, paj their money and go out The buyers do not Bcem to think that they are doing anything unusual, and the merchant Is not at ail as tonished by the transaction. It is plain that the public has responded to the output of magazines. The more the presses run off the aiore it takes. The demand is created by Uia supply. Ifot So Slippery. It is written that the wicked tread upon slippery places. If this can be construed to mean that all who tread on slippery places are wicked, it is certain that there will be less wickedness in this old town this Christ mas than usual. There have been certain places along Nicollet avenue where the wicked have been very numerous. You know where they —the corner of Nicollet and Third street and the walk in front of the Syndicate block, between Fifth and Sixth. The walk at- the former place is made of a kind of til ing imported from France. Each tile is slightly higher in the center than at the sides —that is to say, it has four inclined and slippery surfaces. More men and women have fallen on that pavement than have fallen in all the wars of the century. Men who are so degraded as to find a cruel pleasure in the downfall of their brothers end sisters, have been known to -wait in some doorway there just to watch the falls that are a3 sura to come as the actors after the curtain goes up. The Syndicate block sidewalk has ac complished its devilish designs in another fashion/ Its surface is as smooth as a plata glass front and much more slippery. It is made of a sandstone that has a facultv_for holding particles of ice which the shuffling of thousands of feet reduces to the moat ef fective slipperiness. With each day of freez ing -weather this surface gets slipperier. Many a sad downfall has it caused. But both these dreaded walks have been covered with board* ■ for the winter. They are not pretty, but they are safe. The "Xi»hty" Make* the Baby. There is a difference of opinion as to whether clothes make the man. There are many young men "who are sure they do. They hold that if you "make a front" you : have made yourself. A little 3-year-old boy who seems to take a similar view of the relation between garments and the wearer was put to bed one night In his brother Jim my's night gown. When he noticed the alien garment in the morning, he asked. "Is this Jimmy's nighty?". Being told that It was, he promptly replied, "Then I am Jimmy." A German View of Chamberlain. Detmold (Germany) Zeltung. Mr. Chamberlain is a "pious" man—this man with the flat, brutal face and the eye glass stuck In his eye; he is a tender, hon orable soul—he whom history will name with Attlla and Genghis Khan, he who sweeps ' like a plague over the prosperous land of the Boers and leaves dying whomsoever he may touch with the hem of his garment. The houses lie In ashes—will he scatter them to the winds, as was said of Jerusalem? The cattle are slain—will he poison the wells with 1 their bodies? - The women and children are dying by thousands—will he hasten death with powder and shot? Certainly not, for that would be merciful. Will he torture the prisoners with red-hot irons? What cruelty has not taken place?. What blackguardism which shocked witnesses do not relate? When the plague sweeps over a land It spares on* and forgets another In a merciful way—such mercy is not known toy Mr. Chamberlain. But he went to Edinburgh and has declared that for all that Is still to come, England finds a pat tern and pref^dent In the behavior of th« nations whlcl now denounce Its proceedings as barbarism and cruelty. England 1 doings will never equal what these nations did la Poland, the Caucasus, Bosnia, Tonquin and the war of 1870. We are justified in protest ing against the accusation which Mr. Cham berlain. hurls against us Germans, and w« do this in a plain and clear -way by calling i him ian inlamoua liar. - • I
