it tIw en J dorSewtnt of the country by seating a Q h oJ I polygamist in the national congress The facts in this case are such as I ought when known to rouse the indig nation of evevy patriotic man and woman lt Ct ea I man from the Atlantic i to tue Pacific I We have a right to believe that few if any members of congress will vote to I allow this lawbreaking polygamist to sit in that body to assist in making I laws for the nation The facts are as follows 1 This mal who has just been elect ed to congress is a prominent official in the Mormon church He was born near I Liverpool Engnnd in lS5 and came to Utah in 1561 where his home has been ever since He 1S a man of some I education and of fair speaking ability who has deQled himself ohleliy since 18t0 to the adOeIlc of the peculiar doe trines of Mormonism For a number I of years he was a missionary in the southern states In Utah he is notor I ious as a polygamist On May I 1889 I he Wa sentenced to the penitentiary i in the Third district court in Salt Lake j City for living in polygamy And as j recently as last spring he wrote a long I article in the magazine of which he is editor defending polygamy in the most unmistakable terms as the following I extracts will show Joseph Smith received a command ment from the Lord to introduce that order of marriage into the church and on the strength of that revelation and I not by reason of anything that is writ ten in the Jewish Scriptures the Lat I terday Saints practiced plural mar I riage I Polygamy is not adultery for were It so considered then Abraham Jacob and the prophets who practiced it would not be allowed an inheritance in I the ngdom l of heaven and if polyga my is not adultery then it cannot be classed as a sin at all I It appears to the writer that modern Christians mUst either learn to tolerate polygamy or give up forever the glor II ious hope of resting in Abrahams bo som somThat which he God approves and so strikingly approves must be not only not bad but positively good pure and 1101y 41 Improvement Era Mat JESS pp 472 4Th 478 4S il 2 He was nominated for congress ha the 14th of September against the pro test of a 9trdng minority of his own party on the ground that be is a law breaker living in polygamy and there fore not a fit person to represent this state In congress But notwithstanding I I this protest a large majority seemed I determined to have a pOlygamist as their < candidate In consequence of this j many of the most prominent and patri I otic Democrats refused to support him I The claim made by Senator Rawlins I and others that Roberts was elected I through the indifference of the Gen tiles is not in harmony with the facts The total vote of the state in the presi dential election of HOG was 6Gjj while the vote at the recent election was 65 i28 so that if all who stayed at home because of their disgust at the general situation had gone to the polls and voted against Roberts he would still have been elected by a good majority 3 There is abundant evidence to show that Mr Roberts is living in polygam Jt the present time He is known to have not fewer than three wives and by many he is credited with possessing more than this number One of his wives formerly known as Mrs Maggie C Shipp lies in this city and he has two other wives at CentrevUle ten miles north of Salt Lake where he resides a large portion of his time His second wife who was formerly Miss Celia DIbble is reported by her neighbors to have twin children only a few months old Up to 1895 the Salt Lake City wife was announced in the directory as Margaret C Shipp M D and her sign bore a similar in scription with the prefix Miss At present her sign reads Doctor Mar garet C Roberts at her residence 75 North State street Detailed evidence concerning these veral wives of the congressmanelect is unneCESsary as Mr Roberts has admitted that he has I IL IlluraIity of wives and none of his friends during the camass attempted I any denial of the charge 4 This B H Roberts who has been tletted notwithstanding his unsavory record concerning polygamy is not even a citizen capable of exercising the privileges of citizenship Be was die franchised by the Edmunds law of 1852 for livIng in polygamy Tit eighth sec I tion of that law reads as t ows That no polygamist bigamist or an person cohabiting with any of the persons described in this section as aforesaid in any territory or other place over hieh the United States have exclusive jurisdiction shall I be entitled to vote at any election hEld lin any such territory or other place or be eligible for election or appointment I tll or be entitled to hold any oIDee or place of public trust honor or emolument I ment in under or for any such tprri tory or place or under the United States I This law was reaffirmed by the Ed mundsTucker law of 1887 The only method by which the disfranchised polrgamlsts of Utah could regain the privileges of citizenship was through the amnesty offered by Presidents liar risen and Cleveland But this amnesty = no stntl 1 was on the express condition that they I should abandon nil polygamous relations ldana tions and obey the laws l r the land This Mr Roberts refuses to do So I that he is still disfranchised and there fore not a citztn entitled to vote or hoid any office in the state or nation iih the dection of Mr Roberts hwh has Inflicted so deep a disgrace 1 the stale of Itab must be iargo i attributed t the influence of hmad ers in the dominant churCh yet we note With much pleasure that a strong I minority of the Mormon IIole are at

added hI am quite ready f t ack nowledge that there is much gool in the particular innovation occurring in my mind at the present moment Amer I ica has invariably seat to England the I finest

those representt tves performed their tasks especially in their public utterances on both side oC the Atlantic Sir Edmund Monson then proeeeded to dilate on the recent retnarkabie outburst t fa n le t I burst of public feeling in Great Brit ain provoked by the Fahoda incident and said he ventured to express the I hope that the idea of Great Britain being unduly squeezable and prone to male graceful
