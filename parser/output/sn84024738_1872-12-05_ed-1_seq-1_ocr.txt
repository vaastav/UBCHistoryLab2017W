BEECHER'S DISCOURSE. " No one dies whose death is not momentous. Of all who have pas-ed away not one has gone, for a longtime, who will carry with him so much reverence, so much honor, so much devotion, as the deceased. Who is this inau who receives all these civic honors? Was he one of those great princes of wealth '( Was lie oue of great military x-enown ? No! And yet here are men from every w'aik in life. Here is our Chief Magistrate; here are most promi nent citizens from all parts of the country gathered around the bierot this man, who is now Lomore. Here wesee that ci itlcisin Is disarmed of her darts. A little time ago and men's political passlouswerc all aroused aud we differ as much in politics as ever, but here lies before us tills man, who, but a brier time ago, was a great leader in ttie land. And why do men of all parties gather here in reve rence around his remains? It is because the man is greater than the politician. Here to day between the two oceans there is scarcely a man or child who has not felt the l>eueficent Influence of the character of Horace Greelev. This man gave the streugth of his life to education, to liuinanitv, ami especially to the poor, who could lhtle hefp themselves. He had a great heart that longed for sympathy. Though he may not be remembered by those memories which carry other men's names down, he will be remembered throughout this land for tliooc gieat qualities of mind and heart w'llch make bis character commensurate, as It were, with the genius of this great tiepublie. His Influencehas gone out to teach a nobler manhood to the mechanic, the laborer, and the farmer. What more can we sav in eul igy of the character of this illustrious i dead? Alas, alas, he through a long and not intem pestuous voyige has rcachcd the shore. -How I blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.' May God [ grant that, in the solemuity ot these thoughts in j which we have gathered here, it may be our happy lot tnat when we die angels shall open the gates and receive us Into the glory of the Lord." KKV. Pit. CUAI'IX'S DISCOURSE. After an ode by a qmirtette from St. Francis Xavler's church was sung, Dr. Chapin said: ?? To-day. in the frcshues? of his power, Horace Greeley is laid by the side of his beloved wife. As a pastor and a personal friend I cannot now here attempt to depict the worth and greatness of the deparied Journalist. Horace Greeley's epitaph Is written in the homes aud throughout the length and breadth of the lunti. Where are uow all party and religious differences? I ask you to consider here what la it that brought forth so much lo\c for this man. ft was cot his official position?he held ?one. It was not even his unquestionable genius. It was the attraction of pure and aim pie good ness. The hundred* of toil-worn men who vesterday waited for hour* to look upon 1 tJw free of tb* were not dr*wn thereby any inert curiosity; they went to look at I the features of one who bad been their consistent and untiring friend. Borate Greeley struck for ?what he believed to be right until his mind and heart gave way. He laya dead upon the Held. Let me remind yon that Horace Greeley's life was a re markably practical one. So man, It seems to me, was more givwi to practical purposes than lie- How many lives has he stimulated to wholesome energy I How manygre*t interests of education and science and progress mourn Mm now! All these tributes to-day testify to the recognition of the virtues of this great and good roan. The President of the na tion joins in this tribute to the patriot and the man, [Sluranrsof applause.] ** Let me take occasion to urge Mr. Grceley'3 views of Christianity. He lived in the essential truths of Christianity. He laid on them his weary head and weary heart, and died weary with the turmoil of life. Does the truth come to'us? 41 know that :uy Redeemer llveth.' In Horace Greeley I recognize a proof of immortality. He looked from the trou ble of the surging world to the peace of the grave* where 'the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.' 1 thank God from my neart and soul that wlidn all this world was fading from Ws eves he remembered, '1 know that my Bedf-mer llveth.' It is the triumph of his life and of his denth. And bow, as we take our brother from this church, which has known him so often, but shall know him no more, let this be our lesson, *We know that our Redeemer llveth.' u Farewell, dear fnend! farewell, noble associate ! farewell, great champion I * We know that onr Iie deemer llveth,' and God grant th:it, like thee, we may know it when the light of this world is fading rom four eyes." The services closed at a quarter-past l'o'clock. but the procession did not move from the church untii nearly J o'clock. OitDER OF THE PnOCESSIOX.

General Banks on tiie Opposition STRENGTH.?J" Washington Corre-pondence New l'ork HcraldA?The distinctive feature of to-day's proceedings, both in the House and the Senate, Is apparently the era of good feeling which lias been inaugurated. One prominent Opposition member of the House, liowevr, remarked tb*t thwe Is al ready a telling of distrust among the members of the dominant party, and assigns this as a reason for the non-acccptance of General Banks's resignation. .Meeting General Banks this evening, your corre spondent asked him what he thought 01 the action of the House with regard to himself. He said lie 1 toked upon It as very complimentary. To a fur ther inquiry as to what would be the position of the Liberals in the House, he replied that there arc no Liberals and no Democrats. There are but two parties?the Administration members and tne Op position. As 1 stated In the House to-day, I belong to the latter. ?? By what particular name," Inquired your corre spondent, '? would you call the Opposition ?" ?? By no other name than mem tiers of the Opposi tion. The party seems very weak now. but in a year or two they will show surprising strength." The New Yore ,{ Times" on Governor Walker, immigration, and Virginia?it is so seldom wfc toil find occasion to Commend anything said or done by Governor Walker, of Virginia, that we are the more ready to indorse the sensible views lie lately expressed in a public meeting upon the need of immigration to tint State. His idea that an official volume should be published by tlio State giving full and accurate information of her resources and advantages is one deserving encoui agemeut, and we Iiojh: to see it carried into practical effect. No Mute can be made more Inviting, in all respects, to the Immigrant than the Old Domiuion, and If, after general knowledge is given of her capabilities, those who may settle there arc received with generous confidence and treated with Justice, it will not be long before Virgi nia will enter upou an era of prosperity such as she has never known. It is one of the most encouraging signs of the times that this idea is at last assuming a practical form with the lately dominant claos at the South.?Sew York Times, Decemiei'Z. Utaii and the President?Salt Iyihe City, December 3.?That part of the President's message relating to Utah is highly gratifying to the anti Mormon community. The Herald (Church organ) says the President has been misinformed and misled, and that in no part of the United States is the Constitution held iu more reverence and the laws esteemed more sacred than in Utah. The Journal (auti-Mormou) refutes these asser tions in strong terms. General Lee's Boom.?The Lexington (Va.) Guztltt sets at re-st as follows the storv that has been going the rounds of the press that 'General Lee's room still remains as he left it, and that the Nash ville Union and American was (he last paper read by the General. The Gazette says: "A stray copy of the Nashville Union and Ameri can, left by l'rofessor K. iu the president's office, and seen there by gome Imaginative visitor, has ori gin it;;d the 'last newspaper.' General Lee didn't read the newspapers, and, perhaps, never had a copy of the Union and American In his office. There are no 'curtains' to his room. There never was a 'pair of slippers' there. The General never sat at the window. His chair is now where it always stood, near the ceulrc of the room. The i>en Isn't In the Inkstand, and never was left there. The table Isn't covered with dust.

Perhaps it is not strange that it is so. if the theory of the President and his sup porters is entirely true that everything is going itlong as smoothly as could be expected or hoped In the attain of the Government, there is certainly no necessity for anything more than a business-like statement of the condition of the departments in the President's communication to Congress It seems to have Jwen for the most part prepared by the hearts of the several departments, whose ac companying reports tire epitomized In it. Its most noticeable feature is the constancy and consistency with which the President approves and urges every meisui'e thatlooks tow.ml consolidation of power in ?he central government, such as the granting of subsidies, the adoption of the postal- telegraph sys tem, the Interference with state governments in en forcement acts, &c. fFrom the New York Herald.] It is a valuable State paper, brimming over with all the vast aud multifarious conccrus or the coun try at home and abroad. Unpretending in style and practical In its aims, it may be pronounced a good message. But upon his steamship subsidies and Inland-canal schemes. General Grant Is enter ing upon a field of costly experiments, compared with which our enormous Pacific railway grants and bonds are mere trifles and the seven million? paid for Alaska were a bagatelle, lint if the grants of money suggested as the beginning of these com merced subsidies tfre appalling, what will they be iu their full development ? If we could boast the lull redemption of our national &fl)t there would still be something alarming in these! stupendous propositions of thius-Alleghany canals made and steamship lines supported by the Treasury; but as as It Is, lu our judgment, we have but the alternative of abandoning these costly schemes or the ultimate repudiation ot our national debt. [From the New York World.] In thte last message President Grant makes many recommendations, but they rela'e mainly to gather ing up tlie tall-ends of speut questions. The emerg ing. rising future has not dawned upon bis obtuse mind. He has not the foresight to w>w; bo has no! tbe vigor to reap. He merely follows as a gleaner behind tho^e who have put In tbe seed and gathered the harvest. We will recite all the recommendation* of this message, aud we beg the reader to note how few of them-suggest the spring plough, how many handlethcrakcof the gleaner.
