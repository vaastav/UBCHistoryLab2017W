Coates House lobby and the dcltj at whose well clad feet the chappies of the town bow In adora tion. J. Waldero Kirk, the erstwhile fashion plate, -who drove the one time triumphant Knockout pose, by Jones, of Boston. king of the dudes. Berry "Wall, first into seclusion and eventually to dealing In hard drink, Is under an eclipse. His cway in Kansas City has ended. His reign as the arbiter of fashion is over. His dethrone ment has already been told In The Jour nal. Like a prairie dog he has hunted his hole before the Roosevelt-like supremacy of Jones. He knows it. So does Jones. It was with stately tread and serious rnlenthat Jones emerged from the Coates House elevator j esterday . morning and calmly Indulged In his usual review prom enade. He was faultlessly dressed accord ing to the Jonesque mode. A Jerbv from the latest block, jauntily surmounted his scented ringlets. A storm overcoat almost enveloped his form only a few Inches of his trousers being exposed above his shape ly feet and chocolato tinted gloves pro tected his hands from the biting blasts which occasionally .creep Into the lobby through the storm doors. The chappie idolatry contingent was 5 there, alto. They stood In groups and, with practiced ejes, noted the appearance of the Boston conqueror. His return gaze was supercilious. The curled ends of his mustache assumed a pitying position and his shoulders seemed to shrug derisively. The chappies were awed. They stood speechless, but their eyes sparkled with the gleam of rapturous delight. Twice did Jones pass In review. Then he made his way to the cigar stand and called for his favorite weed. Slowly he ungloved his hands, then the storm coat was loosened nd the same operation performed on his natty undercoat. The gloves were deftly folded Into a ball and placed awaj. A tilt was given his derby and It assumed a rakish position. The cigar was selected, in spected and lighted. Then the idol of the chippies gracefully revolved and faced them. He assumed an air of negligee as he leaned agalrst the counter, emitted a vol ume of smoke in graceful curves from be tween his lips, slowly raised his right hard until it grasped the lapels of both storm ccat and undercoat and, with a quick mo tion, threw them back. Then he smiled. It was a smile of triumph. "Oh!" "Ah!" "Bah Jove!" "Mah Gawd!" and "The darling!" wero a few of the J, Wnldcre Kirk liadly winded and seek ing seclusion) "Oh, for something new; frond for Lumpkin." ejaculations that came In a jumbleJ mur mur from the chappie contingent. "Mag nificent!" cried out one conspicuous mem ber of the guild. "Waldy in his palmiest dajs never equaled it'" And thus was J. Waldere dethroned, cast out and labeled a "hah been." Beau Brummel was never more resplcnd cntly clad. The plaids of the king'1- trous ers were as pronounced as the park signs that adorn the East bluffs, a neavy watehchaln, everv link in which was sug gestive of the Klondike, served as a foil to tho lurid vest which drove Waldere to the verge of insanity Sundav and was the harbinger of hit downfall. The tall collar, with 1U Inch rim of red. was there, and below It, In flaming folds, rested a scarf in comparison with which an Arizona sun set would fade into insignificance. J. Waldere was forgotten by all but one. A bellboy carried him the news. The boy'fe energetic knock was responded to by a timid opening of the door leading to the ex-king's boadolr. A face, surmounted by dl'hcvcled hair, and with ces red from pleeplcssnefs and swollen from unshed trrrs, peered out of the aperture. "Is he gone?" nked trembling lips. "Xaw," feelingly responded the boy, "do mm Bostln guy Is stronger dan ever! He's got 'em dls time fer keeps." "Has he has he, oh, tell me! Has he got his red vest on?" "Yep " "And that collar?" "Yep." "Leave me, boy! Leave me!" wailed the unfortunate. "It Is more than I can bear!" The door came to with a bang as loud as Jones' attire. But later on a chamberimid heard sound? emanating from the chamber of despair which convinced her that the heretofore invincible wardrobe was being subjected to a thorough overhauling. She also heard a wall which said to her un tutored ears: "Why did I do it? "What is the Conven tion hall to me? Oh. my mascot, come back to me! My Monte Carlo suit! My hundred and a quarter babj: I have not had a minute's luck since I gave jou as a gift prize to the Convention hall lottery!" Sobs cut short the monologue and a few seconds later a heavy thud denoted that Waldy had retired to his couch and was again holding communion with its tear stained pillow. As for Jones, he posed and cmiled until he finished Ms cigar and then he strolled out of the lobby and was soon engulfed in the maddening throng, followed at a re spectful distance by the chappies, again bpeechless with admiration. Late in the afternoon J. Waldere made his appearance in the lobby. The old hap- fiy, self-satisfied smile was gone. He ooked neither to the riEht nor to the left. His head was bowed until his chin al most touched his breast. His hit was pulled down until his eves, were hidden from view. His overcoat was tlghtlj buttoned. And, horrors! Ills hands were gloveless! He paced to and fro like a caged animal. Ho gave no thought to his mail, and parsed the telegraph girl twice before he asked If she had a message for him. "What name, please?" she inquired. The dethroned king started as though struck by a Mauser bullet. He pulled him self together, smiled in a Fad. sweet way, and slowly answered. "J. Waldere Kirk." "Oh!" was her only response. Then she nodded her head negatively. He passed on and out of the lobby and when last seen was gazing wistfully at the setting sun. It reminded him ot Jones' vest. RATE IS LOWERED. 'Water Redaction Ordinance Passes Both Houses Fledges Are Carried Out. The water reduction ordinance, provid ing for a reduction of 13 per cent In meter water rates, carrjlng out the pledges cf the Republican party made in the last campalgr, passed both houses of the city council last night with but little opposi tion. In the lower house Messrs. Lynch, Watkins and Johnson voted against It, and In thj upper house Aldermen Graham. Jewell, Seddon and Brown voted against the amendment of the Joint conference committee, and the last three voted against the ordinance when placed on its passage. Major Jones was present and expressed himself as being very much pleased with the result. He will sign It at once. The ordinance as passed provides a slid ing scale of prices up to the consumption of 15,000,000 gallons, when a Hat rate of 5 cents per thousand gallons is in effect until the consumption reaches 25,000,000 gal lons, when a fiat rate of 4 cents per tho'i sand gallons is in effect. This ordinance will make a reduction of $60,000 a j ear In the water revenue, but this has been prov ided for by an extra mill tax lev-. Under the new rate the Armour Packing Company is expected to purchase water trom the city, which will add $30,000 a j ear to the water revenue so that tho actual reduction in the revenue, provided the extra mill had not been levied, would only be $30,000. Aldermen Brown and Jewell objected only to the amendments made by the conference committee as they thought these amend ments placed a premium on a waste of water, a consumer taking 22 000.000 gallons paing $1,1 W therefore, while for $1,000 he could get

DEMOCRATS DO NOT LIKE IT SEVATOR JONES PASSES AX ELAB ORATE CRITICISM. Representative "U'nIUer, of Massachu setts!, Not Pleancd Satisfactory to Other IlciiuhllcanH Lou don I'apem Seem to Be Dlfinppointed. WASHINGTON. Dec. 5 Many senators excused themselves from expression ot opinions at length upon the message, on the ground that they had not been able to give careful attention to all the details. Republican senators were, how ever, willing to express themselves in a few general words of commendation. Senator Cullom regarded it as "a pains taking, entertaining and accurate historical review." Senator Piatt, of N"ew York, commended the expression of a determination to in crease the standing armj and to maintain order In Cuba until the Cubans can take care of themselves. Senator Wolcott said it was an admirable document. Senator Lodge said It was "able and ex cellent." Senator Foraker "A good presentation of facts generally, but a little indefinite on the question of Cuban independence." Senator Proctor "A good American pa per." Senator Perkins "An able resume of the situation and of the facts leading up to the war." The Democrats were even more averse than the Republicans to discuss the paper. Senator Jones, of Arkansas, was an ex ception. He found in the message a num ber of points which did not accord with his views. One of these was the proposition to continue tho volunteer army in exist ence until the standing arm tan be in creased. "Some of us do not favor the increase, of the standing army," he said, "and the president has no right to assume that a majoritv stand with him on that proposition." Ihe Arkansas senator aIo questioned the president's right to hold the volunteers in service bejond tho time of signing the peace treatv. sajing: "There is no war in existence and none is Imm'nent. The law requires one or the other condition, and the threat of the pres ident to hold the volunteers in service until the standing army is Increased bt jond what the conscience of senators and members dictates looks to me like a men ace and an effort to dictate which I con sider an outrage and unpardonable." Senator Jones Interpreted thu president's expression, upon tho finances as a pro nouncemnt'tor the gold standard, and for the retirement of the greenbacks and said that he did not believe that anything like a. majoritv of the American people would indorse him In this respect. The senator also announced himself as opposed to a subsidy to vessels connecting the United States with Porto Rico, Cubi and the Phil ippines; as opposed to legislation for the construction of the Nicaragua canal, as at present contemplated, and expressed the opinion that the president was inclined to go farther in the matter of the govern ment of Cuba than the resolution of inter vention called for. "We declared," he said, "in favor of taking them to that ioInt where they could maintain a 'stable government,' and 1 do not see how we can go beyond that. "To go to the extent of insuring, as the president recommends, complete tranquilltj might prove a pretext for a military gov ernment and permanent occupation never to be ended. 1 do not Indorse anj such an understanding." Senator Jones also expressed surprise at the absence of an recommendation con cerning the Philippines. The question of the government of the Philippine-, is at tracting much attention." he said, "and tho fact that the president utterly ignores it strikes me as very singular." Senator Basco also commented upon the absence of any reference to "points con cerning which wo most desire information " He said, however, that It was a valuable historical paper and would be convenient for future reference. Senator Teller said there would be disap pointment over the failure ot the presi dent to outline a government for the Phil ippines, sajmg: "There will be some disippointment in this, for 1 think the understanding has been that the president would indicate what form of government should be pro vided for these new possessions. But It Is wise for the president not to indicate his views on that object, for that is purely and proper' v a legislative question and one that should be left to congress." On the recommendation In regard to cur rencv Senator Teller said: "The friends of bimetallism, either na tional or International will find no en couragement from anj thing that the pres ident says In his message. No reference is made to international bimetallism, but the president. In the most emphatic wa. in dicates his Intention to maintain the gold standard. The so-called silver Republicans who remain In the Republican part and contend that the Republican part Is friendly to silver will find no encourage ment in the president's message, and it will "trike all as somewhat singular that, if tho Republican party, as it is claimed, is in favor of international bimetallism, the president makes no reference to It." Following are some of the opinions ex pressed 1 members of congress upon the president's message: Representative Hitt. chairman of the house committee on foreign affairs: "The president has summarized and solved in an able and fellcitlous manner ma of the ciuestions m men's minds ever where, touching the immense and rapidly succeed ing recent events, and the situation in which th nation finds itselr. Kcs simple proposition to let the new possessions alone, under just and firm governors and the milit try arm which conquered them, gives us time for plenty of discussion of all the propositions for their permanent govern ment. The problem of governing the Cu bans he deals with gentlj and hopefully, and evei-jbodj will wish that his for cast of stable government there will be realized sooner than ever jet has happened to a Spanish-American population." Representative Walker, chairman of the committee on barking and currency "I am asked what I think of the currencj asd barkins features. I do not see that it has any such features. I have not been able to detect any. It contains only one n commendation as tc the currency, re peating that of a former message to change the United States legal tender rotes into gold certificates, which would havo no effect on the banking and cur rency situation but to add to the burden of taxation without in anv- degree favor ably affecting the general banking and currency situation. Mr. Grosvenor. of Ohio: "The massage is not along beaten paths. It is not en cumbered with platitudes, and It written In a verv attnctlv stle. The contribu tions to history In the elaborate recitation of the events of the war are In good tas:e and devoid of hoisting or vanity. The comment upon the incidents of thp war the valor of our men naval and military and the line work of all our seamen and artlncprs will be found fully Justified ov the fact1-. The views of the president upon tho question of currency reform will meet the intelligent sinction of sound money rpn of all parties The messsge, on the whole, is able and eminently satisfac tory." General Wheeler. Democrat, of Alabama: "It Is a clear and comprehensle resume of events which transpired during an event ful period of our countrj's history. It will be referred to as one of the noted state papers." Representative McMillan. Democrat, of Tennessee: "On one of the most important questions confronting the nation What shall we do with our newlj acquired possessions? the president's message re minds me of the caption of the last chap ter of Johnson's 'Rasselas,' 'the conclusion in which nothing Is concluded ' " Representative Bland, of Missouri: "The message, so far as the currency questlon is concerned, is verv brief and contains nothing new bejond former recom mendations. I might remark that on the great leading l"sue. which Is and will be the paramount question the free coinage of silver the message is ominously sllnt, but no proposition on the menej question ccn be considered without at the same time considering this question." Representative Cummings. Democrat, of New York "It is a clear, concise state ment of facts, without speculation, sug gestion or recommendation. I hav e an idea that the real message will be sent in here after." Chairman Dingley. of the wajs and means committee' The message is an ex cellent resume of the important events of the last j ear, with a clear presentation of the existing situation, and valuable suggestions that will aid materially at the proper time hereafter in solving the different problems .before us. It Is to be noted that the president states that our revenue laws are- working well, with no suggestion of any needed modltication " Mr. Richardson, Democrat, of Tennes see "The president makes a most inter esting and satisfactory review of the Span ish war. but it Is disappointing that lie failed to tell us what we are to do with the new possessions. It is just as app.-o-priate now- as It w-111 be after the treaty of peace, for him to tell us what is to b the future of the new territory. It might relp get the treaty ratified if he had solved that problem. It is Interesting to note the fact that three-fourths of the message re lates to foreign affairs, and less than one fourth to home matters. Banking and currencj- and all financial reform legis lation, so properlj- promised in 1?C, get ro mention, and our condition In respect to these matters Is to be left unchanged." Mr. Bingham, of Pennsjlvania: "A brave, clear and comprehensive message. Strong as the president is in the conti dence and esteem of the people, his mes sage will insure greater confidence, it ioa sible." Representative Ballej-. of Texas, the Dem ocratic floor leader, was called from the house bj- the illness of his son, and asked to be excused from expressing views on the message. 

LONDON PRESS DISAPPOINTED Not Altogether Pleased With the Tenor of Prenldent McKin- lej's .Message. LONDON. Dec. 6. Much having been ex pected, there Is a certain tone of disap pointment in the morning paper editorials on President McKinlej-'s message. Its ron-committal character Is attributed to the fact that the negotiations of the peace commissioners at Paris are not jet fin ished. Considerable satisfaction is expressed at the references to Anglo-American relations, and at the coldness displajed toward Rus sia. The Dally News complains of the "am biguity of the message on commercial and currency matters." and "the conspicuous absence of anj- allusion to free trade." The Times sajs: It is creditable to both the dignity and good sene cf the American people that a message an nouncing the victorious ending of the great war. t'ie acquisition ot territor and the Initiation of an Imperialist policy is sober In tone and moderate in recommendations The uar has finally healed the half closed rounds left by the Titanic contests of the secession and we hop it has exercised a heal ing Influence to be felt even more wide!) and deep ly In another direction ?ot since England rtcognized the Untted States government power has an American president al luded to the mother country in language so cordial and friendly as Jlr. McKlnley's Discussing the- messco approving the detail and referring to-4Jritish rights in Nicaragua under thG Clayton-Bulwer treatj-, the Times sajs: If the freedom of the waterway is secured to ships of all nations, as In the Suez canal, we shall not need to stand strictly upon claims which originated when the circumstances were altogether different. The Daily Chronicle also pays a tribute to the "sober, sound common sense and straightforward language of the message, p. lntlng out that President JicMnlev'n reference to the military occupation of Cuba virtually outlines a policy pret!si the same as that of Creat Ilritalu in Fgypt. and likely to hate the same effect ' " Commenting upon "the president' sur prising language concerning the Nicaragua can il. which utterlv ignores British treaty rights." tht Dallj Chronicle sajs that "this matter will arise ere long in a more acute form." The editorial highlj- approves Mr. Mc Klnlev's references to China and Grsat Britain. The Standard sav-,: Tew could have foretold that the war would work fo rapid and drastic a change How ab'wlute the metamorphosis Is may best be gathered from a com parison with previous messages It is not rah to predict that the Lnlted States will advance In the path upon which their feet are non firmly ret " The Standard construes Mr. McKinley s reference to China as a declaration that, had thp open door been closed or ob-rui t ed America v ould havr- interfered ae'ivelv. It adds upon this point: For all purposes of British poller, no intimation could be more welcome than that the tnittd States will appoint a committee to stud the conditions in China. The Daily Telegraph, which regards the announcement that the United State- will support the open door in China as the weightiest which the message contains, sajs: With such common Interests to unite us, formal alliances are unneccssar) Tho Daily Mall sajs: We are disappointed and surprised at this attempt to set aside the Clayton-I)uIer treaty, especially in view of the Anglo-Vmerlcan entente Tho Morning Post, on the other hand, sajs: Circumstances have changed and the American at titude toward the treaty is quite intelligible, but the Immediate task awaiting Mr. Chamberlain Is the assimilation Into his adnirablc sentimental iew of the Anglo-American relations of the thornr prob lem associated with the Clayton-Bulwer treat).

Thev- were verj inquisitive, asking' numerous questions about the climate, chances for investment, etc. Glllett said he was favorablj- impress ed with Chihuahua and believed he would make this his future home. Thev- got on the southbound train for Durango the following night with their hand baggage, but were not together. The next morning Troxel was seen in town. and. as there was no train arrived from the south during the night, he must have jumped oft the train after it left the sta tion. Neither of them was seen here again rntil their return a week ago. According to the storj- of a Pullman con ductor, a joung woman went with Gll lett to Durango, but she did not return with him. Gillett is waiting here for the return of a part j- who left last Tuesdaj- for Kan sas to bring more money.

Officers arrived Sunday night and are now- waiting the arrival ot the necessarj papers to make the arrest. The governor has expressed his willingness to let the American authorities take Gillett and place deputies at their disposal. The report that the man at tho hotel Is a brother of Gillett's is denied, but the resemblance is great, and it is thought that he is without doubt an accomplice.

SPAIN'S FAILURE IN CUBA. Review of Her Futile Attempt to Pacify the Island Through Autonomy. In my last annual message, very .full con sideration was given to the question ot the duty of the government of the United Stntes toward Spain and, the Cuban Insurrection as being by far the most Important problem with which we were then called upon to deal. The considerations then advanced, and the exposition of the views therein expressed, disclosed my sense of the ex treme gravity of the situation. Setting aside cs logically unfounded or practically inadmlssible the recognition of the Cuban insurgents as belligerents, the recognition ot the Independence of Cuba, neutral Inter vention to end the war by Imposing a ra tional compromise between the contestants. Intervention in favor of one or tho other party, and forcible annexation of tho isl and, I concluded it was honestly due to our friendly- relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to re alize her expectMtions of reform to whicn. she had become irrevocably committed. Within a few weeks previously she had an nounced comprehensive plans, which it was onlldently asserted would be efficacious to remedy- the evils so deeply affecting our own country, so Injurious to the true in terests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba, and so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity. Autonomy a Failure. The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the pacification or Cuba. The autonomous administrations set up in the capital and some of tho prin cipal cities appeared not to gain the favor or the Inhabitants nor to be able to ex tend their inlluence to large extents of territory held by the Insurgents, while tho military arm. obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion, continued, many or the most objectionable and offen sive policies of the government that had preceded It. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappy reconccntra dos. despite the reiterated professions made In that regard and the amount ap propriated by Spain to that end. The prof fered expedient of zones of cultivation proved Illusory, indeed, no less practical nor more delusie promises of succor could well have been tendered to the exhausted and destitute people, stripped of all that made life and home dear ant' herded in a strange region among unsympathetic strangers hardy less necessitous than themselves. (nltrd States Relief Work. By the end of December, the mortality among them had frightfully Increased. Conservative estimates from Spanish sources placed the deaths among these distressed people at over 40 pr cent from the time General Weyler's decree of re concentration was enforced. With the acquiescence of the Spanish, authorities a scheme was adopted for re lief by charitable contributions raised In this country and distributed, under the direction of the consul general and the several consuls, by noble and earnest in dividual effort through the organized agencies of the American Red Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved, but manj- thousands more were Inaccessible to such forms of aid. The war continued on the old footing, without comprehcnsKe p. an. developing only the same spasmodic encounters, bar ren of strategic result, that had marked the course or the earlier years' rebellion as well as the present insurrection, from its start. No alternative save physical ex haustion of either combatant, and. withal, the practical ruin of the Island, lay In sight, but how- far distant no one could venture to conjecture. Destruction ot the Maine. At this Juncture, on the 13th of Febru ary last, occurred the destruction of the battleship Maine, while rightfully- lying in the harbor of Havana on a mission of In ternational courtesy and good wlll-a ca tastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nation's heart prj- Continaed on Sixth Pace.
