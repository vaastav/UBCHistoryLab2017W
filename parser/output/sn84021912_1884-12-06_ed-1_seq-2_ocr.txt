Arizona Sentinel. ($mmtg flicjal fapur. SATUllDA r, DEO. 6 1SS4, End of Vol. XIII. The Thirteenth Volume of the Arizona Ssntixel ended with the last Nsuo. It is to-day on a firmer basis than it ever has beea. it starts out in its Fourteenth Volume under the most favorable aus pices, and will in the future, as in the past, maintain its independence, and will always fostar those things which will bring healthful results in those matters In which the general public is interested. It will devote muoh space to local inter ests, and.Territorial aflalrs, and endeavor to frown down those things which, if al lowed to exist, retard the progress of the country. Being one of the oldest papers In the Territory, and having by good odds thelargest weekly circulation of any paper in Yuma and adjacent counties, the Sentinel is, therefore, the best ad vertising medium in this section of the Territory. It is hoped that the friendship And good will existing in this countv and Territory for the Sentinel will contime, and that at the end of another twelve month, It may again ereet its triends with the same cordiality and good feeling that it does at this time. So be it. THE PUBLISHER. EDITORIAL NOTES. William Nash, he who wields the quill of the "Benson Herald," will contest the seat of W. E.. Wardwell, who has been declared elected a member of the Legis lature from Cochise County. The official returns of this legis lative district give Aiusworth fi4 majority. He carried Apache county by 264 majority and Yuma 212. Cornwall had the following majorities, Mohave, 104; Yavapai, 139; Maricopa, 169. A curious sight has been re marked for a few nights past on the Paris Boulevards. A close carriage has traversed the line of route most frequented by the public with its interior lighted up by means of electricity. On the horse's head there is a small lamp of sprayshape illumined by the same agency, the cuirent being furnished by accumulators under the vehicle. The press of Precott and Tuc son have been quite busy lately organizing the two branches of the Territorial Legislature. When the time arrives for these bodies to meet, there will be nothing for the members to do, but to proceed to business. Hold up, gentlemen, and let the members have some say as to who should be thpir officers. The Phoenix Herald Is right when it says that a Territorial University and a Territorial In sane Asylum should be matters for the consideration of the nest Legislature. We favor both, and they should be encouraged as soon as the Territory can stand lhe pressure. There is a small ele phant at present on hands in the shape of a Territorial prison, which, we believe, should be ful ly provided for, before any great move should be made in any other direction. We don't be- lieve in letting the shoemaker go beyond his last. But, however, if the next Legislature is not able through the embarrassment ot the Territorial exchequer, to pro ceed immediately and -erect those institutions, it can, at least, take the initiatory towards it and ac. complish the object when it can. Young Spreckles, the fellow who tried to ape young Kallock, by shooting and attempting to murder M. H. I)e Young, the present owner of the "Ran Fran cisco Chronicle," is out on a $5000 bail. A dollar to a peanut that a Ban Francisco jury will let him go, and say that he was justifiable in attempting to take De Young's life. San Francisco juries have never been known to find any body guilty of a henious crime who was ready to put up a quan tity of ducats. Young Spreckles should be made an example of, and punished as his crime merits. If he is not cuilty of deliberately attempting to take the life of a human without a lawful cause, then we say open the gates of our penitentiaries and let every criminal in the land go Scot free. Washington's Earcwell. The 101st Anniversary of a me morable event in American history occurred Thursday, the 4lh ins tant, and was, perhaps passed unnoticed by thousands of the over 50,000,000 of souls that move and breathe in this "land of the free and home of the brave." It was the Anniversary of Washing ton's Farewell to his Generals. It took place on the 4th day of De cember, 1783 in Fraunces' Tavern on the corner of Pearl and Broad streets, in tho 'City of New York. Washington was to lake leave of the officers with whom a few days before he had made his triumphal entry into the city which had been the head quarters of the British during nearly the whole period of the Revolutionary war. His comrades in arms awaited him in one of the large rooms of the (ayern. They were silent, their hearts beating quick with sup pressed emotion. Their beloved General entered the room with a firm step, as was his wont, but with flushed cheek and swim ming eye. A man of action and of few words, he looked tor a moment into the faces of the men with whom he had fought and won the great battle for liberty and independence, and then, in a voice trembling with emotion, he uttered these simple words: "With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as pros perous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable. I can not come to each of you to take my leave, but shall be obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand." Tears blinded tho eyes of the hero, his voice failed him, and he could say no more. An over powering, manly grief prevented reply on tho part of his officers. One by one they advanced, and in silence took him by the hand. Not a word was said, When the last man had pressed his hand, Washington turned away, with tears streaming from his eyes, and left the room. From Fraunces' Tavern Wash ington repaired to Whitehall Ferry later in the day, attended by many of his officers, and followed by throngs of citizens, and thence was rowed across the river to what is now Jersey City. There was no ceremony in this ttffecting leave-taking. It was simple and soldier-like, be-fitting lhe character of the men who in a long and heroic struggle had won freedom for their native land. Old Madam Rumor is again on the war-path. She now says that Delegate G. H. Oury will be ap pointed Governor of this Terri lory, vice F. A. Tritle who will be removed by the incoming ad ministration. We should like to see the present incumbent retain ed for he has made an unexcep tional Executive he has been a man of the people and for the people, and his administration has been honest in every regard. If a Democrat is to be appointed we suppose Delegate Oury will be the right man. He is a true- blue Demociar, and is in ample possession of all the traits pecu liar to a Democratic politician, (not necessary to enumerate here) and in this regard he will fill the eye of President-elect Cleve land. On the whole, barring his politics, and his Democratic traits, Delegate Oury is a man that will fill the office of Governor in a satisfactory manner. He is capable, and having been a public man for some years, and therefore knowing the necessities of the Territory, he will discharge the duties of that office In an intelli gent and advantageous manner. We want Mr. Cleveland to fill Terri torial offices with citizens of the Ter ritories. Prescott Courier. So do we, most emphatically! Itisrie-ht that every appointee by the President for Arizona should be a resident here. It meets with the approval of every Citizen in theTerritory. We don't want any more "green" men from abroad. The Territory has ample material in the way of men of ability to fill every office of trust within the gift of the Chief Executive of the United States. Tho Message. The Presidents Message deli vered to Congress on the 2d ins tant is a voluminous document. It covers much important ground and therefore beyond tho scope of this paper. It is probably the last Message President Arthur will send to Congress, as his term of office will expire the 4th of March next, unless something unforseen transpires between now and then, that will necessi tate a similar Stale paper. The most salient points in the Message are as follows: It refera to our amicable relations with all foreign powers. States that the treaty rcstritning Chinese immigration is likely to be again the subject of deli- bcratiou in congress, owing to the tru interpretation of the recent. treaty with China. Expresses gratification at thegood will existing between the" Mexican and American governments. Says the ratifi cation of a treaty of commercial recipro city with Mexico will he hopes, claim the earlcast attention of congress. The treaty with the republic of Nicaragua has been concluded authorizing the 'construction and use of a cannal railway and telegraph line across the Nicaraguan territory. Says that the political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be over estimated. Of financics he says: The Secretary of the treasury estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end July 30, 1883, at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures at $200,620, 201.16, in which arc included the interest on the public debt and the amount payable specie, $67,183,883, total exports of mer chandise and specie, 0,764,092. The cot ton and cotton manufactories included in this statement were valued at 20S,000,415, the breadstuffs at 162,544,715, the provi sions at 114,416,517, and the mineral oils at 47,103,748. During tho same period the imports were as follows: Merchan dise S607,697,693 gold and Eilver 87,426 262, total, $705,123,955. More than 62 per cent, of the entire vr.luo of imported merchandise consisted of tho following articles: Sugar and molasses 103.S44. 274, wool and woolen manutactures 53- 542,292. silk and its manufactures 49 919,128. coffee 49.6S6.705, iron and sltel and manufactures thereof, 41,644,599; chemical, 38,461,965; flax, hemp, jute and like substances and manufactures thereof, S3.466.39S; cotton and manufactures thereof, 30,454,476; hides and skins, other than fur skins, 22,350.906 dollars. lie concurs with the secretary of the treasury in recommending the immediate suspen sion of the coinago of silver certificates, This is a matter to which in former com municatioMS tho President has more than once invoked tho attention of the national legislature. Exaggerated reports have been published lately throughout the Territory in reference to the troubles at Cuitaca. The follow ing from the Tombs! one "Epi taph" of December 1, puts a new phase on that "terrible Mexican outrage," and we believe it to be true: Mr. J. H. Streidinger returned from Cuitaca to-day. He reports everything qu:e ; the Americans taken to Sunta Cri z having been released and work going on as usual. Superintendent Bennett, of the Copper King mine, where the trouble oc curred between the Americans and Mexi cans, reported to Mr. Streidinger that the affair had been grossly exaggerate! by a certain Tomfestone newspaper and that he would fioou publish a correct state ment. The following special diopatch to the "Epitaph"recaived to-dny Irotn Guay mus, corroborates the above: Guuymas, Mex., December 1. No cre dit ought to he given to telegrams in re gard to trouble on the border of Arizona Two Americans, named L. Sanders and J. LaniO, got into a fight with two Mexicans on ;i drunken s;)roe, resulting in the death of Sanders and the serious wounding of Lamb. These parties were not employed at.'nor counectcd with, the Cuitaca mines. The parties at the mine,wlio are Ameri cans, in an attempt to cauture the mur derers had a fight with the Mexican police and shots were exchanged, bat no damage was done to any one. The Ame ricans have all been released. "Butler distinguished himself during the war and his Congres sional record has been very bril liant," said one gentleman to another in our hearing.
