10 'Fingy' Conners Same 'Fingy' Boss Proud of Gov. Sulzer BUFFALO EDITOR, FORMER TRUCKER. HERE ON II TOUR Picturesque Politician Who "Put Mack Out" Manages to "Get Along" With Murphy William J., otherwise "Fingy," Con ners, millionaire newspaper owner and political boss of Buffalo, N. V., whose picturesque career is referred to by boti* his friends and enemies as st gem of its kind, has come to San Francisco to spend a few days resting from his recent strenuous fight in behalf of Gov ernor elect William Sulzer. As a politician he is a graduate of \ what generally is termed the old school. • Thirty-five years ago he was the husk ngshoreman on the Buffalo docks, enable to write his own name, but famed as a two fisted "scrapper" from Erie to Superior, Today he is one of the richest men in Buffalo, has 6,000 men working for him, can write his name, when necessary, and he has ex tended his "scrapping" reputation until it is known from Maine to California. In all his political fights he has never been caricatured, even by his worst enemies. They used his photographs. Likewise they printed verbatim reports of his utterances, when they could get them, as more effective. But he re mains unbeaten—pride and champion of the first ward, Buffalo. Lan rugged of face than when he was here last, his hair whiter and his waistcoat more subdued, "Fingy" spent yesterday looking up old friends and having them look him up. Part of the afternoon he spent in the Chinatown shops with his wife and some friends, returning to the Palace at 7 o'clock. PROUD OF BILLY SULZER "Gee. but I'm glad to get them women out of that place!" quote the millionaire editor, as he sank into a <-nair. "We go in and stick aroun* and my wife nicks me fer a few hundred. • oil.'" He sighed, but seemed not dismayed. It is not in "Flngy" Conners to be dis mayed at anything. On the other he has come to San Francisco to having gloated all over New York, and his subject is the election of Wilson and Sulzer. "That Billy Sulzer Is a regular fel uad the best governor New York ever had." he declared with consider able characteristic emphasis not in- I in the quotation. "It was a great victory for the democratic party and I think the party is goin' to make It'll surprise me if New York have a candidate "for president COaaeri e'aim- credit for defeating Dtjj, in the democratic, con * enlion. WJtmtM MRS. 

SULZER OF "400" "Yep. They say I did him," he said, with his peculiar smile, "an' I guess 1 did. He was a dead one anyhow. Billy Sulzer isn't goin' to be like him. Neither iti Mrs. Sulzer. She's a good fellow, too. I saw her in New York ther day and I said: ** 'Looka here. Mrs. Sulzer. don't you go an' make a Mrs. Dix out of yourself, trying to get into society with a crow bar!' „ a won't, neither." ' Norman E. Mark, pres ent democratic state chairman, are rival editors in Buffalo and rivals for political leadership in the state. Juat now Conners thinks he has Mack "throdeh the skylight," as he put it. *H€* in bad. that's all," said Con nersk T was for Wilson all the time, but Mack goes down to Baltimore, ties up tight to Murphy and agin Bryan. That's where I was in right and he was in wrong. It makes me laugh." Conners would have little to say of his own relations with Murphy, the Tammany chieftain. «*CiETS ALONG" WITH MURPHY "Him and me don't go to bed to gether ever' night," he said, "but we get along." He expressed sorrow over the con dition of "Big Tim" Sullivan, another New York leader, who is reported to be dying. One of his hearers ventured to suggest that Sullivan was better a_*d would recover. •"Taint In the cards," replied Fingy, with emphasis. "I was to see him two weeks ago, and he isn't goin* to get well." Conners has .never held an office and he said last night that he didn't think he wanted one. "I got, it on them guys," he added, thoughtfully, "got in on Charley Sweeny and all them guys. • 1 could get what. I wanted, I reckon, but I don't want. I get on my yacht and have a better time than any of 'em. When my boy grows up I'll give him every thing and then I quit." Although "Fingy" never went to nchool past his eleventh year he is going to send his own boy, William J. •"'onners Jr., to Yale. The youngster is '.is father's joy in life. "He's a great kid," said the father. "<!''« to school there in Buffalo an' president of the Sigma Ga-a-a—er— some such thing. Pretty good for a l>oy, eh?"

At one Ftage in hit- career, •tfter ho left the active ownership of tl.e saloon business that, brought him his start, he wore red vests and three? <>r four pounds of diamonds, but he has forsaken those fancies of late. Various legends attach to the name of Fingy," which has been handed ilown from the old days on the docks. tea from a missing thumb on the left hand, which osce was chopped off or shot off by a companion on a dare, when Conners was a youth. He is still known as "Fingy," although he prefers ihe friendly contraction of his middle name, "Jim." He lias almost absolute control of a business which be conceived and or ganized himself—tbe loading and un loading of freighters at most of the big ports on the Great Lakes. Among hla enterprises are the two newspapers In Buffi*lo. Naturally he does not edit .vspapers himself, but he keeps r close watch on them and dictates the policy day by day.

ROBINSON'S FIRST WIDOW IS VICTOR • ~— Demurrers Seeking to Up- hold 1893 Divorce Decree Are Overruled The first legal victory of Mrs. Fannie M. Robinson was won yesterday In her suit to obtain a widow's share of the fPO.nno estate of the late. Crittenden Robinson, clubman and sportsman, when Judge Seawell overruled demur rers to her complaint to have an inter locutory decree of divorce set aside, which Robinson had obtained against her in Portland, Ore., In 1-593. The demurrers were ipterposed by Minnie Hicks Harlan Robinson, whom Robinson married in New York In 1898, and by Attorney Barclay Henley, one of the trustees of Robinson's estate. The court gave the demurrants 10 days In which to answer the petition for annul ment of the decree. The petition attacking the Portland decree given by Judge B. Steams October 21, 1893, in favor of Robinson, who charged desertion, opens up a new angle In the fight of the two widows — one endeavoring to break the will of the champion wing shot and the other trying to sustain, the testament which leaves her virtually the entire estate, Mrs. Fannie M. Robinson charges that the divorce was obtained by fraud ulent representations, that Robinson filed suit under the name of "C. Robin son," and alleged that he did not know the whereabouts of his Fannie, although she was living in San Fran cisco and he was employed by the state mining bureau. Mrs. Fannie M. Robinson already has applied for restoration of records which show Robinson sued her for divorce in San Francisco in 1886, alleging that she was his wife and mother of his chil dren, that she resisted his charges of cruelty and proved countercharges against him, that she was shown to have been entitled to a divorce had she sought It, and that the court ordered Robinson to pay her $50 a month ali mony. In opposing probation of Robinson's will, the first wife alleges that only a small portion of the alimony ever was paid and that she is entitled to the money out of the estate. A right to half of the estate now is sought in the effort of the first wife to set aside the Portland divorce decree.

ABMY'S VETERAN MULES ARE SOLD Thirteen Decrepit Beasts Who Have Seen Long Service Auctioned Off Thirteen bleary eyed old army mules, whose creaking joints and general de crepitude indicated long and faithful military service, were sold at auction at the Presidio yesterday morning, netting the government nearly $1,200. The animals had been condemned as unfit for further duty, although each had earned honorable retirement. Susie was the name of a mule who was auc tioned off under the uncertain title of "riding animal." The stable boys could tell long and lively stories of some of gentle Susie's antics. She brought $90. * * # Armed with pick and shovel the jolly soldier boys of Fort Winfleld Scott were sent out to work yesterday. The officers called the labor to be done "field duty," which consists of leveling the big parade ground, building roads throughout the reservation, planting trees and digging ditches. The grounds will be beautified under the direction of a score or so of officers who recent ly have been ordered to duty with their companies. The digging and lev eling will be done throughout the month of December, and when the job Is completed Fort Scott will be nice enough for anything. * * * Lieutenant Colonel John H. Gardner, retired, slipped and fell on the steps of his residence yesterday morning, in juring his leg. He was taken to the Letterman hospital, where an X-ray examination showed that the muscles had been badly wrenched. He is ex pected to recover In a few days. « * * Captains Malcolm Young, One Hun dred and Sixtieth company, coast ar tillery corps, and Philip Yost, Twenty ninth company, coast artillery corps, were yesterday placed on the una** signed list.

"With the convening of con gress I have hopes that the law will be amended somewhat," said Colonel Febiger. "At present we don't knowj who Is coming and who is going. Offw cers by the wholesale lots are being transferred at a moment's notice and the army is in a state of chaos. I hope congress will relieve the situation, which is bad for officers and enlisted men alike." * * # Captain Walter M.

SENATE MEETS FORTWENTYTWD MINUTES ONLY Message of President Taft Will Come to Both Houses of Congress This Morning Continued From Page 1 ing colleagues. When the name of Representative James Cox of Ohio was reached he too received a flattering sendoff. Representative Robinson, who leaves the house to become the governor of Arkansas, was not present today a#d missed the plaudits be stowed upon his two colleagues who are to become governors. Every member of the house and those In the crowded galleries above joined In a spontaneous tribute to Uncle Joe Cannon as the clerk called the name of the old republican warhorse, who has seen service of more than a third of a century in the house. The former speaker smiled as though the ovation had removed sbme of the sting of de feat. In direct contrast to the senate pro ceedings, the time honored exuberance of house»members was in evidence long before the formal opening of the house. Members slapped each other upon the back; democrats crowed over the suc cess of the party at the polls; crowded galleries looked on the animated scene below and the entire spectacle was picturesquely American and typical of the reassembling of the popular branch of the national legislature. ■ k . Three members have died during the recess and this cast its dampening in fluence on the house. After the for malities bad been observed, that body learned officially of the demise of Rep resentatives Anderson of Ohio, Utter of Rhode Island and Corinell of New York, and simultaneously came the report of the vice president and Senators Hay burn and Rayner. Adjournment out of respect to the dead was ordered. The galleries emptied and the members filed quietly out of the chamber. 

MESSAGE TO BE READ TODAY President Taft's message will come to both houses tomorrow. The senate will meet at 11 o'clock, an hour before the customary time. <=o that the mes sage may be received and read before proceedings are begun in the court of Impeachment which is to try Judge Robert W. Archbald of the commerce court. No business was transacted by the senate, but a number of bills and reso lutions were introduced in the .house. A joint committee was named by the two houses to notify President* Taft that congress was ready to receive his communications. Senator Bacon, presiding officer of the senate, appointed Senators Cullom and Martin and Speaker Clark named Representatives Underwood of Ala bama, Mann of Hlinois and Johnson of Kentucky.

Representative De Forest also in troduced a resolution for a constitu tional amendment tip limit the. tenure of the presidential office to one term of six years and another repealing the newspaper publicity section of the last postofflce appropriation bill. A resolution calling for early action by the banking an4 f-urrency commis sion In its investigation of the so called money trust was introduced by Representative Lindbergh of Minne sota, author of the original "money trust" inquiry resolution. The resolu tion. In a voluminous preamble sets forth that in the '-many months" since the investigation was organized "the committee seems tc have considered the investigation from the standpoint of securing facts to aid in early future work in framing remedial financial leg islation, but seems rather to have been planning an Investigation as if for in dictment and In such purpose is blocked by those who have offended against honest and impartial rules of business and by government officials who deem the personal privileges of banks so sacred that the business may not be Inquired into even for the bene fit of the. public welfare.
