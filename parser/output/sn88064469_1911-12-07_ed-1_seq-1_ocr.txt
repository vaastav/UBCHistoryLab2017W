The President's Mlessage. ''Th message of President Taft to Congriss is of the usual style of verbosity. ) ilung to its length ionly a few of the people will Ireai it iin its entirety. In this message he has no reference to the tariff, which he. is probably reservinlg for a special uil lerance. Perhaps lie would o iri'- shadowv the l ariff issue with itheo trusts, especially the Sherman anti trust law. Evidently t lie Sherman nalt has reached the limitations of its usefulness, if it ever did possess a single' ingredient calculated to benefit the people. The trusts have grown and are growing in deliance of the. restrictions of this act, which should he repealed. In his conten tion over the trusts, lthe good and the had, the President infers that "the mere size does not coinstlitulte a sin," but in the application of the law there is some difference as to the sinner. The individual of limi ited means doing a small business for a livelhood who would defy the law could not expect. the same con sideration that would be given to a million-dollar concern. Figuratively the whale would be styled as "clev er," while the small fry would he hastened to the pen. In brief, lhe people can expect, no relief from the exactions of the trusts and the com bines, created and upheld by the Re publican policies, through which the favored few are fattening while the toilers are struggling for existence. Twenty years ago the trusts and combines were few in number, but today they are all powerful in their influence over the national govern ment. A change in the administration from Republicna to Democr'atic con trol offers the only relief. Parkerson Has Withdrawn His Sup /port from Miehel. From New Orleans is the an nouncement. that W. S. Parkerson has withdrawn his support of John T. Michel for governor. In explana tion Mr. Parkerson states that the recent revelations connectind Mi chel with the White Lake, the Chef Menteur and the Frelsen matters does not square with his idea of the proprielies of right or of correct public service.
