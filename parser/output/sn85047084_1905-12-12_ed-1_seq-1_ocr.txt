Slattcry's Task in Hawaiian Waters. A copy of the annual report upon the improvement of Pearl and Honolulu harbors, Hawaii, in the charge of J. R. Slattery, First Lieutenant, Corps of Engineers, II. S. A., has been received from the author. The report gives much valuable information concerning the commercial aspect of the harbor of Honolulu. The first portion of the report con tains an extract from the annual re port of the Chief of Engineers to the Secretary of "War, as follows: Office of the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, Washington, Sept. 29, 1905.

Pearl Harbor. This work was in the charge of Col. W. H. Heuer, Corps of Engineers, until April 14, 1905. This harbor is 8 miles west of Honolulu. Before improvement there was a bar at its entrance with a low-water depth of 10 feet on its crest and a coral reef either side. A full description of channel 200 feet wide and 30 feet deep at mean low water, at an estimated cost of $100,000. Congress approved this propect by appropriating $100,000 generally 31 feet) in depth at low water entirely across the bar from deep water in the ocean to deep water Work on the Kohala ditch continues to make progress that fairly assures a flowing of the fructifying waters at the time "nominated in the bond." It is hoped that the first section of fourteen miles from Honokane west will be rjompleted by the first of July next, so that water will be delivered in time for planting. An additional six miles will be built to windward as far as "Waimanu. considering that constructive operations were not begun till April 10 this jear, the progress has been most rapid. Indeed it adds laurels to the credit of the Territory of Hawaii for vigorous activity. Nine of the fourteen miles i;nder construction are in rock tunnel, of which the following are the data of progress: April, 1461 feet; May, 5100 feet; June, 8715 feet; July, 7267 feet; August, 5195 feet; September, 3547; October, 3307; November, 2978 feet. About 8000 feet more remain to be completed before all the borings will be finished, which will be in about four months. For the remarkable progress made much of the credit is due to the Japanese. The labor is being entirely performed by this nationality, who exhibit especial proficiency for rock ex cavating work. About ten miles of the fourteen will be lined with concrete and cement plaster through porous strata to obviate the loss of water from seepage. This work is now under way and being pushed as fast as the tunneling is completed.

Inside the bar the channel is so crooked and the turns so sharp that it is not safe for the navi gation of large vessels. No estimate for remedying this 'defect has yet been authorized by Congress. The rriean range of tides at the entrance is about 14 inches. The work, so far as authorized and appropriated for, has been completed in accordance with the project.

It is formed by a coral reef, a narrow channel through the reef affording access to the harbor. The entrance channel and harbor prop er were dredged from time to time by the monarchical, republican and Terri torial governments of Hawaii prior to July 1, 1904. On this date there exist ed an entrance channel having a depth of about 35 feet and a minimum width of about 200 feet at mean low water. The harbor proper (that portion com mencing at the lighthouse and extend ing to the mouth of the Nuuanu river) had a general width of 800 feet. The water for about 200 feet immediately along the wharves had a depth of from 30 to 32 feet. Elsewhere there was only about 27 feet at low water. The bend at the lightouse point was so sharp as to be somewhat difficult tor large vessels to get around. The sha! low water in the harbor made It im possible for the largest vessels call- ins at th nort to enter the narDor when at all heavily laden. The nar rowness of the harbor made turning difficult for all ships. The river and harbor act of March 3, 1905, provides as follows: Improving harbor at Honolulu, Hawaii: In accordance with the report and surveys made by the land department of the government of the Sandwich Islands prior to annexation and the further report of Lieutenant Slattery, two hun dred thousand dollars: Provided, That a contract or contracts may be entered into for such materials and work as may be necessary to prosecute said work, to be paid for as appropriations may from time to time be made by law, not to exceed In the aggregate two hun dred thousand dollars In excess of the amount herein appropriated. The amounts herein appropriated and authorized may be expended upon sections one. two, and three, it being the intention to provide first for the completion of section one. and the Secretary of War is authorized and directed to cause a resurvey of said harbor to be made. California. ! The inception of the project is due to Col. Sam. Parker and J. T. Me Crosson, though it did not assume a substantial status till the Hind estate and Mrs. Samuel .Parker lent their financial assistance. It is estimated the ditch will cost when completed about $750,000, and the Hawaiian government, under the terms of the franchise, will have the privi lege of acquiring it at this figure. The whole constructive part of the enterprise is in charge of M. M. O'Shaugbnessy, C. E., who executed the Makaweli and Koolau aqueducts in rrevious years in a successful manner. The Kohala ditch bids fair to add greatly to the material progress of the big Island of Hawaii,, though the tourist and kamaaina will regret the disap pearance of the many picturesque waterfalls now ornamenting the bluffs be tween Waimanu and Kohala. In future the streams that make these beautiful objects will be intercepted by this work and their contents led out to the farm lands, where they will create new beauties of landscape besidesjnereasing the prosperity of the Islands to a degree at present difficult to calculate. 

SCHWEITZER TALKS ABOUT HIS MANILA BREWERY PLAN Louis Schweitzer, secretary of the Honolulu Brewing & Malting Company, which manufactures Primo beer, returned from a tour of the Orient yesterday on the Korea, accompanied by Mrs. Schweitzer. Mr. Schweitzer's mission in the Far East was to investigate the field and ascertain whether there was room for another brewery. Associated with Sena tor Hocking, of the Honolulu brewery, and two San Francisco capitalists, Mr. Schweitzer was armed with authority to make a thorough investigation of the prospects, and the choice now practically lies between Shanghai and Manila. While in the latter city Mr. Schweitzer came in contact with the San Miguel Brewing Companv, which claimed to have a monopoly in the business brewing beer, in Manila at least, and that company made public statements to that effect, quoting old Spanish laws to back up its contention. This did not scare Mr. Schweitzer off and he obtained a ruling from the Attorney-General of the Philippines, which indicated that if Mr. Schweitzer wanted to go ahead and establish a new brewery there was nothing in the franchise granted the San Miguel people to prevent a competitor from entering the field. Shanghai was looked, upon as a promising field for a brewery. "Shanghai is certainly the Paris of the Far East," said Mr. Schweitzer, "and everything is on the move. There is business everywhere. The streets are lined with rickshaws and other vehicles and crowds of people are moving up and down and the stores are busy places. "I saw Lorrin Andrews and he told me he was doing well. In fact he said he had made $750 a day or two after getting there and that was mare money than he had made in Honolulu for some time. He does not intend to come back to Honolulu. "Can we ship Primo beer to the Orient? Well, there are a lot of agents Ihere who would like to get our beer but the steamship companies won't make us a rate. Therefore, we can not enter the market. "As to whether we will build a brewery over there, either at Shanghai or Manila, I can not state just now. I have not yet made my report." . . o INTERNATIONAL MIX-UP.

Japan Gazette. (Continue! on Paire ?.) -4 BUS! TIM He Is Preparing Matter for Information of Congress. It's "from early morn till dewy eve" with Governor Carter's work these days. For his grinding toil the pres ent session of Congress is the occasion. President Roosevelt in his message having dedicated a big gun to Hawaii, the Governor has gone into the ammu nition factory to rush forward a sup ply of cartridges. "I do not know whether I shall be able to get away," the Governor said yesterday respecting an invitation he had received from Admiral Goodrich to accompany him, a week from today, in the cruiser Chicago for a trip to Hilo and a visit to the Volcano. "A good many letters have to be .got off, for which data must be prepared. Yes," the Governor assented, "for the information of Congress and promo tion of legislation the Territory badly needs. "One matter needing attention is that of personal property in the custody of the Territory. An opinion of the At torney General's Department holds that we can not sell the old tug Eleu. The boat is of no use to the Territory or to the United States, and there a-re old animals and road machinery to uling applies. ust be legislation on that question. It involves a waste of prop erty that might be sold to either party's advantage, but at present is of no benefit either to the United States Government or to the Territory. We ought to get authority to sell any such property. "I must write to Delegate Kuhio and give him data in aid of his measure to secure an appropriation for payment of the expenses of our sessions of the Legislature. He has asked for it. It would.be a mighty good thing. The Federal Government, I understand, pays f'fte legislative expenses of every other Territory. This is not so im portant, however, as other matters be fore us." With regard to the Governor's busy days, it may be mentioned that he was rung up on business at 7:15 yesterday morning. From that time until 5 in the afternoon he did not have a mo ment he could call his own. Even as for luncheon he tasted none and it is doubtful if he so much as took thought to cinch up his waistcoat band for reduction of the gnawing vacuum. His sole relief from grind at the executive desk was an excursion he took with Supervisor Jack Lucas to the outlet of the storm water drain age system. This was to investigate a damming of the outflow by the fill-ing-in of the marine park site at Ka kaako with harbor dredgings. The matter has beer, brought to the atten tion of the Board of Supervisors by petitions and Mr. Lucas, as chairman of the road committee, solicited the Governor's influence to secure an ex tension of the system through the fill- ed-in tract by the Federal authori ties. Governor Carter was not prepared to give out his views on the matter yes terday evening, but said he was goin: to send a letter to the Board of Su pervisors relative thereto. All the time the Governor was at his office, between morning and evening, there were people in the outer room awaiting their turns for interviews.
