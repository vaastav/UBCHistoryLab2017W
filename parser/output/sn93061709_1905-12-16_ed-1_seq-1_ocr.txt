"I recommend that Indian Torriton and Oklahoma be admitted as one state, anil that New Mexico and Arizona be ad mitted as one state. There is no obliga tion upon us to treat territorial suhdivi sions, which are matters of convonienci only, as binding us on the question of ad mission to statehood, nothing has taken up more time in Congress during the past few years than the question as to to the state hood to be granted to the lour territories above mentioned, and after careful con sideration of all that has brim developed in the discussions ol the question, I re commend that they be immediately ad mitted as two states. There is no justifi cation for further delay; and the advisi- bility of making the four territories int.) two states has been clearly established. "In some of the territories the legisla tive assemblies issue licenses for gambling. Congress should by law forbid this piac lice, the harmlul results ol which are oh vious at a glance." - Kn tract from the President's message. J J Ifagerman, of Koswell, being asked the question, ''How do you fuel about the appointment of your son an governor?" gave, the Record the following statement: "I am grate! id. ol course; 1 belii.vu hu will perform the duties ol the oilier: acceptably to the people I lis handn are free lie has no enemies to punish nor pets to reward TUCUriCARI, NHW 

MEXICO, CHARLES BALLARD, THE ROUGH RIDER. THE ROVGH RIDER WHO IS NOT OUT FOR OFFICE The Carlsbad Sun interview!; ('has. Mallard as follows, regarding the marshal ship of the territory: "There is not enough in it to justify neglecting or selling my ranch, upon which, with ordinary success, I can do better financially, being at home among friends, instead of roaming over a country that 1 have seen before many limes over." Asked about the shei ill's olliee, he said: "I am not out for ollice, and do not want ollice." "Hut suppose, Mr. Mallard, the people should ask you to go to the council again?" "1 hope that some other man may be chosen, as I have had plenty of council and am not wishing for the ollice." Mr. Mallard is one among a large number of Rough Riders who is not a politician and who has no desire for ollice of any kind. lie is probably the only I )emocrat in history whoever refused an ollice. Notwithstanding all these objections, he is one of the most hiuhly esteemed citizens of New Mexico in both parlies, and a gentleman of the old school, lie is a personal friend of the President, who has oflered to favor him at various limes, but he prefers his ranch and home circle to all the offices in the gift of the people. The President and many of his friends wanted him to be II. S. Marshal for New Mexico, but with due regard toall of them, he prefers to ranch. There is only one Charlie Mallard in all the Southwest, but it were better for us if we had more of them. The President demands economy i n public expenditures, the abolishment of useless ollices and the introduction ol bus iness methods into the various departments of government. Just what New Mexico is promised under the new governor a n d joint statehood. I lalf the ollices of New Mexico and Arizona will be abolished un der jointure, and in the meantime Mr. liagerman will introduce economy and business methods into the territorial gov ernment. Koswell Kecord. I ''red Walther, the merchant, farmer and stockman of Puerto, was in town Mon day. Mr. Walther has decided that tli-ue is more! in raising thouroiigh-bred stock than for the scrubs, and it takes 110 more pasture or feed than for the ungraded ani mals, hence, he is now in the hog business lor all ii is worth. He received here Mon day a thorough-bred Poland China sow from the K. L. Howard farm at Piano, Texas, and will introduce that slock on his larni at Puerto. He is one among many men now in yuay County who be lieve in the stock-fanning btiHtnuHK a n d intends to pursue it lor th revenue that is 'o be dui ived from it.
