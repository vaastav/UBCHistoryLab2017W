MESSAGE The Presidents annual message has bsen given to Congress From the many points of view it is one of the ablest and most comprehensive ttate papers that have ever emanated from the White House It is full of the spirit of optimism and the strong sense of national pride which charact erizes the many fcubjecta treated will cause the eagle to scream with in creased vigor and the American citi zen will realize more than at any time since the blrtn of the republic tbat Wo are indeed the people The re ports of the various branches of the government indicate that the country is in a healthful condition financially and that our material f ources are being fostered and developed in a highly en couraging degree The expected era of prosperity seems to have arrived and the future holds out tho promise of a greater nation in wealth educa tion and territorial expansion Liberal systems of government are guaranteed to our insular possessions and the President indicates a firm purpose to sustain American sovereignty where ever the Hag has been boisicd includ ing permanent retention of the Philip pines and the continuation of the war until order is restored in tbat archipel ago The most Interesting feature of the document is the reference to the lynch ing question For months the colored people of the land have petitioned and bsseeched Mr McKinley to give out some public utterance against the vio lence of mobs which was undermining the courts destroying the confidence in the general government and mak ing a mockery of the Constitution in several states of the country Negrces who dared to contend for their rights were made to fiee from their homes and their property was confiscated or rendered valuless by the action of law less citizens It was felt by everybody that an expression of disapproval of these baleful and un American prac tices would have a most salutary mor al effect and tbat instruction to the federal officers to exert their influence on the side of law and order would eo eo hold out the fear of punishment to offenders that the horrors of this sys tem of execution without legal process would be reduced to a minimum Mr McKinley has spoken Not only has he reiterated the sentiments con tained in his inaugural address con demning mob violence but has rein forced them by utterances that admit of no dcubt that he is thoroughly in earnest As expressions they are all that could be desired except that he makes no appeal to Congress to provide means for the enforcement of the prin ciples ho claims to be right Some body must take the initiative in meting out the punishment advised Experi ence has taught us that the state courts of the South cannot be trusted of crime nor will the machinery of the law be properly utilized to bring to justice those who unwarrant edly nsurp the functions of the courts Here are the words of the President Trie love of law and the sense of obedience and submission to the law fully constituted judicial tribunals are embedded in the beans of our people and any violation of these sentiments and disregaid of their obligatioss just ly arouses public condemnation The guaranties ot life liberty and civil rights should be faithfully upheld the light of trial by jury respected and de- defeuded The rule or the courts should assure the public of the prompt trial of those chargtd with criminal offenses aLd upon conviction the punishment should be commensurate with the enor mity cf the crime Tnose who in disregard of law and the public peace unwilling to await ihe judgment of court and jury consti tute themselyes judges and execution ers should not escape the severest penalties for their crimes What I said in my Inaugural Ad drts3 of March -1 1697 I now repeat The constituted authoillies must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld Lynching a must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United Stales Courts not mobs must execute the penalties of the laws The preservation of public order the ngut of discussion ine integrity oj courts ana tne orderly administration or jus tice must continue forever the rocs of safety upjn which our Government se curely rtsts We cannot do other than give Mr McKinley due credit for these very honest and forcible utterance and we sincerely hope they will carry the weight that such a rebuke from the highest officer in theland should carry and that Congress will back up the movement so happily begun and bo strengthen the laws on the subject that criminals can be reached and punished by the national authorities when the state refuses or fails to do its full duty We should bare felt much more en couraged however had Mr McKin ley spoken as directly upon the lynch ing of Negroes as he did upon the lynching of the Italians lu Louisiana and bad he as strongly impressed upon Congress the necessity for protecting our own citizens as for providing for the fcafety of foreigners who may hap pen to get into trouble within the boundaries of the United States We believe the first duty of Congress is to secure to the brave Afro American the rights and Immunities that are justly his to guarantee tho enjoyment of civil and political privileges to the sturdy men who have Lome arms in defense of the national honor who have tilled our fields who have hewn down thefoiests and who have built up the waste places of our prosperous land Yet we honor Mr McKinley for the attention given our cause and we shall not be backward in doing all within power to make eflective the principles he eo clearly outlines If he shall use his good unices to push up to the scratch the subordinates over whom he holds the power of life and death and lend the aid of the admin istration to such measures as will con fer any needed authority not denied by the federal Constitutiou the situation will quickly improve Ihe Negro will do his share The game is up to Con gress now Tho Presidents message comes as a refreshing draught and will do much to silence one very strong ground for complaint on the part of our people Should it so happen that the re publicans make their ticket read Mc Kinley and Root and the democrats should pin their faith to Bryan and Hogg the political jokist and pun maker would be called upon to work overtime If we could have our way for a brief period the so called Negro Quarter of Washington would be abolished so speedily that it would make some bodys head swim The absurd segre gation grows out of an old time pre judice that is row justifiable only in the most limited degree Ihe speciacle ot ill clad people forever sitting on front stoops door after door apparent lv with not an earthly thing to do is an abomination calculated to make angels to weep This is equalled in of fensiveness by the figures of sundry mammies with their heads tied up in rags smoking an antiquated pipe and calmly surueying the situation from the windows rubber necking into tho afiairs of all their neighbors We do not know what can be done to abate this species of city nuisances but we do know that the community and the reputable portion of our race would be better off if something could be done toward breaking up Negro neighbor hoods root and branch If his present luck holds out Manager Chase will have an abund ance of Christmas suits on hand 

EXPANSION IN METHODISM It the A al connection is wise it will not be niggard in the matter of electing Bishops at the next session of its General Conference There are several vacancies to be filled Other Bishops are getting along in years and cannot endure the fatigue of travel and preaching as they could two de cades ago and they are forcedo cover large districts as best they can The districts all around should be reduced in size to the end that the supervision may be closer and more beneficial and to grant fair trials to Negroes accused that the Bishops may have more time for reading and study The church represents to the people of our own and other races much of the intelligence and organizing capacity of the Negro and when a Bishop opens his mouth in the vast gatherings he is frequently called upon to address he runs the gauntlet of the critical judgment of the country Sometimes those who listen are not ardent admirers of our race They are often too willing that errors in statement logic and in grammar due to hasty preparation shall form their estimate of the intellectual at tainments of which the Negro is capa ble Let us through our leading church officials put our best foot foremost by t lecting en ugh Bishops to carry on the work in the proper manner The selection of five or even six Bishop3 would mean a higher grade of ef ficiency more souls for Christ and more money What is said of the A M E Church is likewise applicable to the A Al E Zion Churchs legislative body which convenes in this city m Hay of the next year This great organization should choose at least two Bishops and three wouldnt be too many It is time for our greatest churches to take on the prevailing spirit of expansion When some thoughtless person un dertakes to talk about the white people paying 95 per cent of the taxes of a given locality where Negroes consti tute a large proportion of the popula tion just call to his mind that to the brawn and industry of those blacks the white man owes a large measure of hi3 ability to earn the title to his property To be sure the Negro is rated as a tenant but the tenant pays all the taxes and expense WHO WILL BE DELEGATE The canvass for the delegateship to the next republican convention is be ginning to take form and color A boom of no mean dimensions has sprung up in favor of Mr Daniel Murray and it is understood that he will hpve the backing of the Board of Trade of which he is a nfember aLd the business and real estate interests generally Mr Murray is a worthy man and represents the solid citizen ship of the District and it would sur prise no one if he should be the suc cessful aspirant Dr C B Purvis is said to be a canddate but as yet his feet are snugly encased in rubber shoes He is said to have the active sympathy of that old war horse Col rerry Carson but it must be re membered tbat Brother Carson has not yet told his friends that he would not be in the field himself The wise acres say that Banker L C Bailey will not be in it this year that his meteoric dash of 1896 gave him all the politics he could digest in the next quarter of a century Lucius Peterson is lying low posing as the candidate of the younger element but it is said that his claim to this particular repre sentation will be contested by Aldrich T Levis of the District building The alternates will be selected from the best of the defeated candidates for delegate and that problem is being allowed to take care of itself All teem to be sparring for wind at this aage of the game The fight is young yet and it is anybody s victory as it stands We have no idea what it is all about but Brother Wimberlys sprightly pa per the Augusta Union comes to us each week leaded to the guards with a dozen varieties of buck shot grape and cannister besides several tons of dynamite Whoever Wimberlys is after will get it just above the collar if he doesnt look out MR AND MRS JOHN E BRUCE John E Bruce the ubiquitous and irrepressible known to the entire read world as Bruce Grit has been doing Boston But we may add he is doing that center of brains and culture good Mr Bruce is always a trenchant and original writer with a rare faculty for picking out just exactly the things which tickle the mental pal ate of the public and which furnish a practical information and line of thought not obtainable from any other source Happy In expression and adept In the hurling of javelins into the tender regions of his ne aa iJruce always is he seems to have outdone himself in this series of Boston letters and flown upward sev eral flights on the literary staircase We have eDJoyed them and have been pleased to share that enjoyment with our many patrons Modern journalism has no brighter light than that given out by John E Bruce and tdvanced civilization has not a more gallant champion thanthid versatile and ener getic man of the pen It is a delightful circumstance that Mr Bruces success has not beeu achieved alone Womans sweetening influence has been a potent factor for be it known he has had at all times the sympathy and encourage ment of a faithful wife and from her he receives much valuable assistance In his labors Mr and Mrs Bruce will please accept assurances of our most distinguished consideration Now that Mr Hobart is no more tho republicans must find a suitable vice presidential candidate to fill out the McKinley ticket Sewell of New Jersey Fairbanks of Indiana Bradley of Kentucky and Atkinson of West Virginia are all good men and could each carry their state for republicanism We have no preference at this time anybody will do except Teddy Roosevelt and H Clay Evans A LITTLE TALK ABOUT THE RENTING OF HOUSES Theie is frequent and just complaint that respectable colored people are de nied the occupancy of good residences in desirable portions of this city lead ing thus to the building up and perpet uation of that nauseating anomaly thp jNegro neighborhood Here are crowded in indiscriminate confusion all classes and grades of colored peo ple driven together from Fheer in ability to secure decent accommoda tions at reasonable prices in localities of their choice where white people en joy better dwellings at rates no higher than 13 charged colored people for in ferior homes in unsanitary and poorly environed precincts The owners and agents are greatly to be censured for their indisposition to trust their judg ment in separating the crood tenants from the bad and to treat each ac cording to his merit A citizen who obeys the laws and conducts himself in a manner that makes him a con genial neighbor or at least a harmless one should be allowed to live in what ever quarter he elects provided he can pay the price others pay for similar service Anything short of this is un fair and un American Something must be done to rid Washington of the pest holes and disease breeders known as alley houses with their concomi tant immoral atmosphere A step in the right direction would be the mg in the suburbs of clean wholesome cottages to be rented at nominal figures to respectable colored families Now that the car lines go everywhere for five cents it is no hardship for the poorest to go into the suburbs where light and air and all tho comforts of hjme life can be had in abundance To be sure the real estate men have their tale of woe to tell in regard to the reasons for discriminating against even well appearing colored people They claim that the average Negro family is not as careful in the use of a house a3 the average white family of the same social status They point to the fact that the stay of the Negro tenant is generally of short duration and instead of cleaning up when they go they leave floors unswept the win dows dirty the woodwork bruised and scratched the walls or paper torn and disfigured from lighting matches etc md the closets or outhouses full of ac cumulated rubbish An agent claimed that he could cite a case of a well-to-do colored family to whom he had rented a nice house had so shamefully abused the premises that it cost as much to put the place in habitable order as the people had paid during their short tenancy and further that domestic cleanliness cannot be determined by external appearances or cultured ad dress frequently the people of the so cahed -middle class made the best customers from every point of view promptness in payment of rent length of stay and care of property We can not say how far we are to blame for the distressing conditions that confront us but if any of these allegations are true we should set about applying a remedy It does no harm once in a while to confess to ourselves some dis agreeable facts about ourselves for the correction of an evil can only come through a candid admission that the evil exists We know persons white aad black to whom we should not like to rent a well kept house of ours yet it is none the less unjust to force the innocent and painstaking to suffer for the sius of the sloven and indifferent The wolves can be separated from the sheep it the proper precautions are observed It might be well for an ap plicant whatever his color to be re quired to show a certificate from form er landlords statng in what condition he was in the habit of leaving the places rented by him Thus every tenant could be estimated independent ly and intelligently according to the record he had made This is a large subject and should be discussed at length by our Councils and literary organizations If we are responsible for our troubles let us set about the creation of a better order of things and remove thesa objections by cleanlv and considerate treatment of leased proper ty If the other fellow is at fault we mu3t find a way to get him on the right side In the meantime work for the elimination of that abomination the alley house Ex Senator T T Allain is a thor ough race man and is sound on all the issues of the hour He is safe reliable and conscientious He will honor any post to which he may be called and nothing is too good for him He is one of tt e most useful workers for race elevation in publc life today OOOGINb ISSUES DO NOT SETTLE THEM Negro theaters would help to clarify the problem of accommodation just as Negro hotels restaurants and other business enterprises are doing We believe in developing our own indus tries That 13 all right but the issue at stake in the present controversy is not settled by letting the white man alone when he has anything we want and when we are legally entited to the same The Negro would be obliged j to get ofi the earth if the wish of some white separatists were consulted Let U3 build up theaters and every thing else we can of our own butwhere there is an article in the white mans place which he operates under a license to serve all the people it must be our privilege to go there and get it on the same footing as other citizens Dodg ing issues do not settle them Political affiliation is a local ques tion It must be adjusted to suit the needs of the time and place The Ne gro must study the situation closely and be brave enough and independent enough to choose the course that will bring the best results to the whole peo plenot forgetting himself in the round up Politics is simply a matter of business The white man knows that to be a fact The black man gradual ly becoming aware of it DR L W
