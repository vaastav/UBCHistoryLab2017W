Cms. G. Dorset," f ' ' ' Register. On cur first page, to-day. we copy that portion of President Johuson's Message ' deroted to Reconstruction, and hope it may be generally read.' It's " interest ..grows not out cf any originality', but from its sameness to the tune he played "around the circle." Tbe people's verdict is ijnored, its lesson disregarded, and My Policy" c til 1 claims to stand on its own bottom." the "circle" of which the President seems . to think marks the cr cumferecce of tbe United States, i Thij entire disregard of ihe expressed will of Jhe people, ar.d stulborn assump tion of "My Tolicy,-!! meeu with most L;Iuvic2 cosaplKseuls from iclel organs everywhere, but with loyal journals its; ..reiteration cf the condemned "policy" '.arouses but coateopt for the demagogue ,ho, in his "circle" workr spoke of the :tyraccy cf the masses" as more to be . dreaded thaa,4My Policy." ' " Its ' effect ypen Congresi was the least "Lof any document of the kind ever deliv. "red, and his suggestions, if any could ; le found in the document,- fell without weight "or Uror. As the President will persist in forgetting the will of the loyal j people, insomuch" is CongTess in duty louud to ignore and check him;', as the . : President shows a growing partiality fr rebels, insomuch should Congress watch " .Lira with suspicion and thwart' any evil . ... i he may attemrs Congress is true, tried and more carneit ua ever,, as to the thorough reconstruction of the rebellious section, &bd will not brook dalliance on the part or the President or rebels. t The Prtsident, in the latter portion of the message, adrises that a Territorial form of government be established for the District of Columbia and a Delegate in Congress allowed it. . Of loreign affairs the . message says : "It is a subject of congratulation that no foreign combinations against our peace . and safety have'been formed, or attempt ed. While sentiments of reconciliation, loyalty and patriotism have increased at home, a more just consideration of our national' character and rights has been manifested "by foreign nations." He congratulates the country on the comple tion of the Atlantic Telegraph ; and is sanguine of tbe early completion of the . Kamschatka and Russian Telegraph line. Tiie protest cf Congress t gainst foreign countries pardoning convicts upon their removal to this country, he reports duly forwarded and the practice stopped. The President has protested against the pro ject of 'Spanish American adventurers" "to induce the emigration of freedmeu" ... ? . it dace the a to bondage even more oppres ' sire thin that from which they have iust , (flan sa f . or'!

On the Fenian raid the President very naturally defends his ac tion as made neceujirhy .the existing neutrality laws, and says he .hit regard ed "the expedition as not only i pcMllcat in its nature, but also i a' agril measure j foreign to the VVited iStates in its cause,' character and objects." He says "such representations have been made to the -Rrit-QftTgmfflent, -in-behftlf--of-the : convicted persons," was will, it is hoped, induce-them in these cases to an exercise of clemency and a.judicial amnesty .to Rll who were engaged in the movement.' Of the neutrality laws be says, fso long as those laws remain upon our statute JkliJJPHyj faithfully executed," and 'nFthey alone can apply, the remedy is ' their modification : ur repeaL" " He says on the right of expatriation," this "Government has claimed for all persons not connected or accused or suspected oi crime, an absolute right of self-expatria-tion and a choice of new national allegi ance Most of the European States have dissented from this principle, and have claimed a right to hold such of their sub jects as have immigr ated to and been nationalized in the United States and afterwards returned on transient, visits, to their native countries, to the perform ance of military service in like manner as resident subjects " As this, question has frequently caused difficulties between this and foreigu countries and recently duriDg the war be. ween Prussia, Austria Italy and as there is now general peace, the President urges Copgress to pass a law plainly defininglhe position of . this Government ia favor of the right of self expatriatioo. . . ; L-. x i .. --! ...

Col. Scrip, Land Warrants, Cash,:V !.- 10,434 acres, 5.556 956 t 600 . Total.. 17,746 " e also informs us that the number of applications already on file during De cember indicate that a good business will be done this month, if the Receiver will attend to his du'.y. . Tre St. Joseph Herald, conservative, highly commends the President's Mes sage acd says : . .; "From a perusal of his arguments no man would gather that there had ever been any excitement on the subject of "My --Policy," or any fiercely contested electibns in which ;ihe. question, of-the restoration of Southern fctates formed aa element,' Thus is he complimented by the Cop per-johnson press upon the worst feature of his message the attempt to ignore the expressed will of the people. This policy, on the part of the President, be comes still more contemptible vtiren we remember with what apparanl candor he su- ranted .My.jpolicy" to the people for therr decision, .and the confidence and even recklessness with which he scat- tered amons them Constitutions and stars: Congress has before it the decision clear- iy ezpressea,. ana win carry it out ae spite, the ignorance or clap-trap of the President or his followers. Nothing less than the Constitutional Amendment will be accented, more will be bad if it i rejected. . From the Union Seniinal, published at Hiawatha, Ks., just over the line, we leara that two weeks since-"a desperate fight. took place ia Nemaha county be tween four horse thieves and the SherifTs posse of men who were after them. Two of the thieves, named Ben Strange and Wm. Jackson, were arrested and lodged in jail. Tbe other two. named Mel LWn,and Sach. Moony, were pursued by the citizens and overtaken, when they .turned and fired upon the persons that were pursuing them, killiog one man and wounding anothor.' We have heard since, that the whole neighborhood turned out and succeeded .ia catching aai hanging the thieves."-" ' ' ' ' This , is near home, and we hope is suSciint to;cause bur ' farmers to be on the alert.
