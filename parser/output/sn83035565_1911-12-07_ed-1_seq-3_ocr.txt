SI PROBLEM IS TAR'S TOPIC Message to Congress Devoted to This One Matter. DECISIONS ARE DEFENDED Dissolution Plana of Standard Oil and Tobacco Explained Federal In ' corporation and Commission Recommended. Washington. President Taft's annual message,, which was read In both houses of congress Tuesday, deals exclusively with the anti-trust statute. The message In part Is aa follows: ' To the Senate and House of Represent atives: This mesag-e Is the first of sev eral which I shall aend to congress during the Interval between the opening of Hi regular session and Its adjournment for the Christmas holidays. The amount of Information to be communicated as to the operations of the government, the number of Important subjects calling for comment by the executive, and the trans mission to congress of exhaustive re ports by special commissions, make It Im possible to Include In one message of a reasonable length a discussion of the top ics that ought to be brought to the at tention of the national legislature at Its first regular session. Decisions of 8upremc Court. In May last the Supreme court handed down decisions In the suits In equity brought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the American Tobacco trust, and to aecure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch-making and serve to advise the business world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti trust law, of 1890. The decisions do not depart In any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court in constru ing and applying this Important statute. but they clarify those Important decisions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal construction of be -act. By the decrees, they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with tha capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions sug gest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make It easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to preserve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. It has been said that the court, by In troducing Into the construction of the statute common law distinctions, has emasculated It. This Is obviously untrue. By Its Judgment every contract and com bination tn restraint of Interstate trade made with the- purpose, or necessary ef fect of controlling prices by stifling com petition, or cf establishing In whole or In part a monopoly of such trade, la con demned by the statute. The most ex treme crltllcs cannot Instance a case that ought to be condemned under the statute which Is no brought wlthtn Us terms as thus construed. The sugestion Is also made that the Su preme court by Its decisions in the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited discretion to de termine whether a case of restraint of trade la within the terms of the statute. This Is wholly untrue. A reasonable re straint of trade at common law Is well understood and Is clearly defined. It does not rest In the discretion of the court. It must be ltmited to acompllsh the purpose of a lawful main contract to which, In order that It shall be enforceable at all, it must fe incidental. . If it exceeds the -Tfeeds of thyit. contract It Is void. . I Methods of Dissolution. In the Standard Oil case the Supreme and circuit courts found the combination to be a monopoly of the Interstate busi ness of refining, transporting, and mar keting petroleum and Its products, effect ed and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations, the Btock of which was held by a New Jersey company. It In effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer and pro-rata distribution by the New Jer sey company of the stock held by It in the thirty-seven corporations to and among Its stockholders, and the corpora tions and Individual defendants were en Joined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly; and alt agree - ments betwen the subsidiary corporations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In the Tobacco case, the court found that the Individual defendants; twenty nine In number, had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire complete do minion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco In this country nnd abroad, and that this had been done by - combinations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices, and establish" a., monopoly, not only In the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin-foil and licorice, used In Its manufacture and of Its products of ci gars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presentend a -far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard OH suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the vlola " tion of the statute. There was here no Ingle holding company ' as In the Case of the Standard OH trust The main com pany , was- the American Tobacco com pany,' a manufacturing, selling and hold ing company. The plan adopted to de stroy the combination and restore compe tition involved the redlvislon of the capi ta and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies constituting the trust and new companies, organized for the purposes of the decree and made par ties to .it, -and numbering, new and old, fourteen. . , -' - Purpose Not Confiscation. It Is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corporation, or by forfeiture of its goods In transporta tion, are provided, but the proceeding In. equity is a specific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by Injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital in violation of the statute. I venture to say that not in the history Did as He Was Told. A young Irishman from a remote part of Ireland recently secured . a berth as barman at a hotel in Man chester. . The first morning at 6 o'clock young Murphy was instructed to light the lamps outside. This he proceeded to do 'very businesslike, but half an hour later could not be found. Inquiries were' made, and eventually Murphy was seen about 7:30 lighting a lamp near Middleton. having lit all the lamps on the Roch dale road for about four miles. Ideas. Credit Societies. Theere are now 3,458 urban and rural co-operative credit societies In India, with a membership of 226,958 and a working capital of $3,442,680, of which only $240,090 is contributed by the government These figures repre sent the work of about seven years. ' Put Away Despair. Fight lika a good soldier, and if thou ometlmcs fall through frailty., take gain greater strength than before, trusting In My mora abundant .grace., Thomas afCempla. v TRU of American law has a dscrse more ef fective for such a purpose been entered by a. 'court than that against the Tobacco trust It has been assumed that the present pro-rata and comiron ownership In all these companies by former stockholders of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies Into which the trust has by decree been disintegrated. This is er roneous and Is based upon the aaeumed in efficacy and Innocuousness of Judicial In junctions. The companies are enjoined from co-operation or combination; they have different managers, directors, pur chasing and sales agents. If all or any of the numerous stockholders, reaching Into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the control of the market, their number la so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed and Its prime movers and all Its participants would be at once subject to contempt proceeding and Imprisonment of a summary charao ter. The Immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies under different man agers and than competition must follow, or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Cry for Repeal of Law. But now that the anti-trust set Is seen to be effective for the accomplishment of the purpose of Its enactment, we ere met by a cry from many different quarters for Its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old-fashioned methods of de structive competition between small units, and to make impossible those useful com binations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to continued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions the Supreme court makes clear that there Is nothing In the statute which condemns combina tions of capital or mere bigness of plant organised to secure economy In produc tion and a reduction of Its cost. It Is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of Im mense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly, that the statute Is violated. For Federal Incorporation. In a special message to congress on January 7, 1910, I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trusts. I said: "But such an Investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders but of millions of wage earners, employes, and associated tradesmen must neces sarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from its places of hoarding, and produce a halt in our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circum stances among the Innocent many for the fault of the guilty few. The ques tion which I wish In this message to bring clearly to the consideration and discussion of congress is whether. In order to avoid such a possible business dauger. something cannot be done by which these business combinations may be offered a means, without great finan cial disturbance, of changing the char acter, organization and extent of their business Into one within the lines of the law under federal control and su pervision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute. "Generally. In the Industrial combi nations called 'Trusts.' the principal business Is the sale of goods In many states and In foreign markets; In other words, the Interstate and foreign busi ness far exceeds the business done In any one state. This fact will Justify the federal government In granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell in Interstate and for eign commerce the products of useful manufacture under such limitations aa will secure a compliance with the anti trust law. It Is possible so to frame a statute that while it offers protec tion to a federal company against harmful, vexatious and unnecessary Invasion by the states, it shall subject It to reasonable taxation and control b7 the states with respect to its pure ly local business. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquir ing and holding stock In other corpora tions (except for special reasons, upon approval . by- the proper federal author ity), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the holding com pany with subordinate corporations In different states, which has been such an effective agency in the creation of the great trusts and monopolies. ;"If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint of trade Is to be effectively enforced. It Is essential that the national govern ment shall provide for tne creation of national corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with respect to foreign corporations makes it dlVfccult. if not impossible, for one corporation to comply with their re quirements so as to carry on business in a number of different states." Federal Commission Proposed. I do not set forth In detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation permit ting and aiding the formation of combina tions of capital Into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules aa to their organization and procedure. In cluding effective publicity, and to the closest supervision as to the Issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission In the department of commerce and labor, to which In times of doubt they might well submit their pro posed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that Incorpora tion under a federal law could not ex empt the company thus formed and its incorporators and managers from prose cution under the anti-trust law for sub sequent ilegal conduct, but the publicity of Its procedure and the opportunity for frequent consultation as to the legitimate purpose of Its transactions would offer It as great security against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise. I recommend that the federal charters thus to be granted shall be voluntary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection' of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of tho law. Other large j combinations that fall to take advantage !of the federal Incorporation will not have ,a right to complain If their failure is ascribed to unwillingness 10 suomit ' their transactions to tho careful scrutiny. competent supervision and publicity at tendant upon the enjoyment of such a t charter.

The best bacon is produced in Den mark, Great Britain, and Canada. In feeding experiments corn is shown to produce soft, oily bacon, while oats, peas and barley make the very best bacon. In Denmark, barley is a favorite feed for fattening bacon hogs. Corn not. only makes soft pork, A Piece of Bacon of the Heavy, Cheaper Grade. Too Thick and Fat. but fattens too much. The moderate use of corn in bacon production is not objectionable, say 25 per cent, along with foods like skim milk, barley, oats, peas and pasture.
