The gigantic War of which he is chief director, and the perilous condition of the country, should have inspired a production of vigor, force and exalted atatesmanship. Instead of this we have a dry abstract of the repurts of his cabinet, officers: Instead of Jove with his thunderbolts wa have a clown with his baubles. The chief pointa, aside from his statis tics are: He proposes the issue of bonds not tax ablc and not liable for indebtedness ef the older. This policy is based upon the assumption that the middle and poorer classes of our citizens are a set of rascals: That they will purchase the bonds to de fraud their creditors. It is a first clas premium for dishonesty. He suggests, in a very obscure way. taxing out of existence the issues of all except National banks. Ho says that no attempt to negotiate with the Rebels would do any ood, and re-affirms his Abolition proclamations. Gold went up twelve cents on the dollar in an hour or two after the proclamation was issued. Negro Equality Approach- ing. Wherever there is a considerable negro population, aud especially .1 . in tne cities. the Abolitiouists are laboring to brine. bout social equality as a preliminary tep toward political equality and mis cegenation; or, in the language of Lin coln, they are laboring to "educate the people up" to the recognition of univer al equality. It is well known that the! negro balls in New York have been habit- j nally attended by the leading Abolition- Slave Irade than a squadron ib oarowt tola of that city, and that the Abolition ! hands- The possession of the least or . . , . ganized Baval force should stimulate a papers report them in glowing descnp-1 nn,bition pn the nart of the Re- tions of the gorgeous aallroonis, the ele gant and accomplished gentlemen and the bewitching aud splendidly attired ladiea.

Even these wretched pro ductions are generally prtpared by white j.ai'kalla for the black lion. The desperate valor is all exhibited, and the brilliant charges are all made by1 negro troops. Frequently we have lengthy accounts of battles in which all the credit iR given to the blacks. Often while the negroes are lavishly praised not a word is a&iti of the white aoldiers no more than if ne whites had been engaged. 'AH these things are for a purpose, and that purpose is te "educate the people up" te toieteting negro equality. Before four yeara thii identical subject will be the iasue between the political parties. jsF" The Holmes County Firmer, ene ef the meat efficient Democratic papers ia the State, copies our remarks "To the Democrats of Monroe County" and adds: -Very sensible talk, Brother Williams.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and Souse of Hejrcsen(a fives: Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundost gratitude to Almighty God. The condi tion of onr foreign affairs is reasonably atisfactory. Mexico continue te bo the theatre of civil war. While our political relations with that country hare under gone no change, we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents. At the request of the state of Costa Rica and Nicaragua a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Junn, and the port of San Juan. It is a source of nuoh satisfaetioo that the difficulties which, for a moment, excited some political appre hensions, and caused a closing of the inter oceanic transit route have been amicably adjusted, and that there is a good pros pect that the route will seen be re-operjed with an increase of capability and adap tation. We would not exaggerate either the eommerciabor the political importance ef that great improvement. It would be doing injustice to an im portant South America State not to ac knowledge the directness, frankness and cordiality with which the United States of Columbia have entered into intimate relations with this government. A claim convention has been constituted te com plete the unfinished work of the one which olosed its sessions in 1861. The new liberal constitution of Arenezuela having gono into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people, the stovorn ment under it has been re-organized and diplomatic intercourse with it has been opened in a cordial and friendly spirit. The long defered Avis Island olaim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged. Mutual payments have been mads of the claims awarded by the Joint Commis sion for the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries and such ef forts as were in tny power have been used to remove misunderstanding, and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain. Our relations are of the most friendly nature, with Chili, the Argentine Rcpub i io, Bolivar, Costa Rica, Paragua, San Salvador and Hayti". During the past year no differenced of any kind have arisen with any of these republics, and on the other hand their sympathies with the United States arc constantly ex pressed.

Disloyal emissaries have beer, neither less assiduous, nor more succe ful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts under fa vor of that privilege to embroil our coun try in foreign wars. The desire and de termination of the maritime States to de feat that design are believed to be as sin cere, and cannot be more earnest than liurope.

I de-i understood while ! treaty of the fifth of Ju sire, however, to be making this statement, tiiat tuo bolohral authorities are nit deemed to be intciitiou ally unjust or unfriendly towards ihe Uni ted States, but on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that with the ap proval of the Imperial Government they will take the necessary measures to pre vent new incursions across the bonier. The act passed at the last session for tho encouragement of immigration has, as far as was possible, been put into operation, tt seems to need amendment which will enable the officers ef the Government to prevent the practice ol frauds against the lwmi'rants whue on their wav and on V mr their arrival in the ports, and so as to se cure them her a free choice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition towards this great national p licy, is manifested by most ol the European States, and ought to bo re ciprocated ou our part by giving the Lnj- migrant tsiteeuve national protection. 1 regard our immigrants as one of the prin ciple replenishing streams which are ap pointed by Providence to repair t he rav ages of internal war and its wastes of na tional strength and health. AH that is necessary ia to secure the flow of that stream in it present fullness, and to that end the Government must iu every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military ! seryice upon tliDse who some from other j lands to east their lot in our country. The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered. During the last year the legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially i effected the revenue, although sufficient j time has not yet elapxed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acta of Congress imposing iucreas- e- taxation Ihe receipts during the year from all sources upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including leans, and the bal- : ance in the Treasury on the irstday of July, 185d, wore $1,394,706,007,62, and the aeeresate disbursements upon the sn:e basis, were $l,298.0ob,101,89, leav- io? balance in the Treasury as shown by warrants, of o96,739,905,73.

The public debt on the first day of July j last, a? appears by the books of the Teas ; ury, amounted to one billion, seven hun , Ired and forty million, six hundred and I mrw.f.r k . .", 1 ' 1 . .! i I . fwimj luuusauu jour iiubuicu an i eigllty nine dollars aud forty-nine cents. Probably, shoald the war continue foi another year, that amount may be in creased by not far from five hundred mil lions. Held as it is for the most part by our own people it has become a sub-tan- : branch of national though private VVitli this view, I suggest whether it might not be both expedient and competent ior Congresa to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona pile purchaser, exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and lim itations as miht bo necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This would enable prudent persons to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want. Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited, most desirable to overy person ef i small means who might be able to save. enough for the purpose. The great ad vantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt ..! v i .

The report of tho Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field sinee the date ot' the last an nual message, and also the operations ot the several Administrative Bureaus of the War Department during the iast year. It will also specify the measures deemed essentia! for lite nation. use, and to keep up and supply the requisite military force. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehetisi ve aud satis factory exhibit of tlm affairs oi that. De- partinent and of the naval service. It is a suoject ot eeiigr.jtUi atiou and lauda ble prije to our countrymen, that a navy of such vast proportions has been organ ized in S' brief a period aud conducted with so much efficiency and success. The general cxh it of the navy, including vessels unde. co .strueiiou on the 1st of December, 186-1, shows a total of 671 vossels carrying 4,610 guns and aid. 396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by ship- wreek or in battle oi- 33 vessels, 167 guns and 42,427 tons. The total number of men at this time in the uaval service, including officers, is about 51,000. There have been captured hy the uavy, during the year, 321 vessels, rtd the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is one thou sand three hundred, of which 267 are steamers. The gross proceeds arising from tho sale of coudemned prize proper ty thus far reported amount to $14,395, 250 51. A large amount of such pro- eeeds is still undei adjudication, and yet to be reported. Tho total expenditure of tho Navy De partment of every description, including the oost of the immense squadrorii that have been cailed into existence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st of No vember. 1864, are 23.864,726,235. Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of Navy, especially in regard u ,i,t V m elv--. slam - . m. wwmw mm mMM r , .. ' ' mj iast a-nua. g. Your attention teals invited to the views expressed in tne report in regard te of the Postmaster General for a detailed account of the operations and financial conditi n of the Pst office Department. Tiie Postal Revenues ior the year end ing -nine .0th, 1864, amounted to $1,243-f- "25.:7S, aud the expenditures to $1,264, ;r7.G20. Tho excess of expendif mes over receipts beiug $20,60o,242. The views presented by the Postmaster uencral on the subject of special grants by the Government in aid of the estab lishment of ocean mail steamships, and he policy he recommends (or the dcvel upement of increased commercial inter course with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful con sideration of Congress. It is of note- woimy interest mat tne steady cxpan sion of population improvement and gov ernuuntal institutions over the new and unoccupied poruoo. ni our country pave scarcely been checked, much less impeded 1 - or do Uroyed, by our great civil war, which nt first dance, would seem to have absorb ed almost the entire energies of the na tion. The organization and admission of the Stnte of Nevada lias been eoniplteol in conformity wi li law, and thus our ex cellent system iu the mountains, which enee seemed a barren and uubospitable I was.te between the Atlantic States and i those wl-.ich have g'own up ou the coast ! of the Pacific Ocean. The territories of the United States are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and the in terruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have been only par tially organized, but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like those of others, to go into speedy and full operation. As intimately connected with and promotive of the material growth of the nation, I ask the attention of Con grass to the valuable information and im portant, recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific railroads end mineral discoveries, con tained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is beiewith trans mitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patants, pensions and oth er opics of public interest ;-rtaining to his department. The quantity of public lind disposed of during the five quarters ending on the 30th of September last, was 4,221.342 acres, of which 1.278 fi14 aeres were entered under the Homestead law. The remainder was located with military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads, and sold ior cash. The cash received from sales and loca- j from sales during the fiscal year ending l June 30tb, ISO-i. was ?:-:7.800.721. agaiust i v'i3,bj , tiu received during the proceslinr 7 ear.

The great enterprize of States by railways and telegraph lines had been entered upun with a viiior that gives assurance of success, notwithstand-. ing the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of material and 1 ibor.

It was rccommei.ded in my last annuij message that our Indian system be remodeled. Congress at. its Inst session r.cting upon the recommendation, did provide i'or re organizing the system in California, and it is believed that under the present or ganization, the management of the In dians there will be attended with reason able success. Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper govern ment of the Indians in other parts of the country, to render it secure for the ad vancing settler, and to provide for the welfare of the ludian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is invited. The liberal provisions to invalid sol diers and sailors of the Republic, and to the widows, orphans and dependent moth ers of those who have fallen in battle, or died of disease contracted, or of wound received in the service of their eountry, have been diligently administered. There had been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last, the naiuos of 16,770 invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army in valid pensioners 712, and that of widows, orphaus and mothers 22.198 have been placed on the army pension rolls, and ; 248 on the navy rolls. The number of j army pensioners of this class is 25.433, i and of navy pensions 793. At the be I ginning of the year the numbcj of revo I lutionary pensioners was 1,450. Only i twelve oi them were soidiers, ot whom j seven have since died. The remainder are those who, under the law, received pensions because of relationship to Revo lutionary soldiers. Duriut; the year end ing the 30th of June 1864,1545.046.5 6,92 have been paid to pensiouers ef all classes.

All the important line and positions then occupied by onr force have been maintained and our armies have steadily advanced, thus liberating the negroes left in the rear, so that Missouri.

At the last session of Congress a proposed amend ment of the Constitution abolishing sla very throughout the United States passed thfc Senate, but failed for lack of the re quisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress, and nearly the same members, without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of these who stood in op position. I venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the meas ure at the present session.

Lti-.-.n.! i, it if il v.ilV.o tJF tlw. pie now ior the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end, is very desirable almost indispensable; and yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable, unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority, simply because it is the will oi the majority. In this case the common end is the main tenance of tiie Union; and among the means to secure that end, such will through the election is most clearly de clared in favor ef such constitutional amendment The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is deliv ered thrungb our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its re sult, the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain the integrity oi the Union, was never more firm, nor more nearly unanimous than now. The extra ordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of votera met, and miugled at the polls, gave strong assur ance ot this. Not only all those, who supported the Uuion ticket, so called, but a great major ity of the opposing party also may be fair ly claimed to entertain and to be actua ted by the same purpose. It is an unan swerable argument to this effect that no candidate for any office, however high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There has been much impugning of motives, and much hearted controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union causa; but on the distinct issue of Union, or no Union, the politicians have shown their instinct ive knowledge that there is ne diversity among the people. In affording to the people the fair op portunity of showing, one to another, and to the world, this firmness, and unanimi ty ot purpose, the election has been of vast value to the National cause. The election has exhibited another faet not less valuable to be knewa, the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most importaut branch of National re sources, that of living men. While it is melonoholy to reflect that the war has fill ed so many graves and carried mourning to so many hearts it ia some relief to know that compared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few while corps aud divisions aud brigades and regiments have formed and fought and dwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who con: posed them are still liv ing. The same is true of the naval service i He election returns prove t .is. Co many voters could not else be found. The States regularly holding elections now and four years ago, to-wit: California.

It is not ma- terial to enquire how the increase has! been produced, or to show that it would have been prater but for the war, which is I .prooaoiy A true.

This as te men, and material resources are now mora com plete and abundant than ever, The national resources then are unex hausted and, a we believe, inexhausti ble. The public purpose to establish and maintain the nstionl authority is unchang ed, and, as we believo, unchangeable. The manner of continuing the effort re mains to choose. On careful considera tion of all the evidence accessible, it seem to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgeant leader could result in any good. He wonld accept nothing short of sev erance of the Union, precisely what we will not and cannot give. His declara tions to this effect are explicit and oft repented; he does not attempt te deceive ns; be affords as no excuse to deceive ourselves. Heoannot voluntarily re aeccpt the Union, we cannot voluntarily yield it Between him and us the issue is distinct single nnd inflexible. It is an issnr which can only be tried by war, and decided by victory. If we yield we are beaten. If the Southern people fail hiia, he is beaten. Either way, it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who head the insurgent cause, is not necessarily trne of those who follow. Although be cannot re-accept the Union, they can. Some of them we know already desire peace and reunion. The number of such may increase. They cau at any moment have peace, simply by laying down their arms and submitting to ihe National hu thur.ty. Under the Constitution, after so much, the Government could not, if it would, maintain war agaicst them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it.. If questions should remain, we woul i adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conferences, courts and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain aud ?tV,e' P"bli; q,,e.tions are md would be beyond the executive power to adjust, ae tor instance the admission of merobdra i pardmis iiid remissions of forfeitures. however, would be still within the Execu tive control, in what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago, a general pardon and amnes ty, upon the specitiud terms, ware ofierud to all except certain designated claa.-es and it was at the same time published that the ex'-epted cases were still within contemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed them selves of the general provision, aud many more would, only that the stigma of bad faith in some led to u'h precautionary measures as rendered the practical pro cess less easy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted, classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full year upen to all except such a were not in condition to make tree choice, that is such as were in cu-tody or undt r constraint. It is still so open to all, but the time may come when public duty .shall depend Miat it be closed, and. that in lieu, more rigorous measures than here tofore bo adopted. I prcnt the abandonment of armed re sistance to the national authority on the Prt of the insurgents as the only end ;. enable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, and retract nothing here'ofore .id as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ro. that while I remain in my present position I shall not nttempf to retractor modify the K mancipation Proclamation, nor sh-tll I return to slavery any person ,i i is l.co by the terms of t nat procLmu tion or by any of the acts of Congress. If the people houfd by whatever mode or means, may it an executive duty to re inslave such persons, auotiier aud not 1 must be thoir instrument to perform it. -In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to nay that the war will cease on the part of the goverment whenever it shnll bave ceased on the part of those who began it. .iirue.ij
