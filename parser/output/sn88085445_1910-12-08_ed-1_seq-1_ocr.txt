Vol. 3 CONGRESS OPENS I SHORT SESSION Indications are Little General Legislation Will Be Attempted. Washington—The sixty-first con- STese assembled Monday for its final session. Almost immediately alter convening both houses followed the custom of adjourning for one day out of respect to the memory of those members who have died during the summer recess. Five senators and three representatives have died since the beginning of summer. Upon re assembling Tuesday tne two houses listened to the reading of the presi dent's annual message. The message was unusually long running from 30,000 to 40,000 words In a general way the president urged upon congress the necessity for enact Ing legislation to build up the Ameri can merchant marine, to conserve the natural resources of the country, to provide a new form of government for Alaska, to "supplement and strengthen" the Sherman anti-trust law, to enlarge the scope of the civil service law, to create a national bu reau of health, to provide a legislative basis for workingmen's compensation, for the limitation of injunctions is sued by federal courts, and to pro mote closer commercial relations with Canada. The president also gave his views in regard to the further regu latlon and control of corporations engaged in interstate business and the regulation of the issue of stocks and bonds of lnterstete railways. Get Down to Business. After the reading of President Taft's annual message the lawmak ers were able to get down to business almost immediately, as the details of organization and committee changes required little time. The opinion Is gaining ground that little else than the passage of the various appropriation bills will be attempted. Statements by leaders of various parties and factions indicate that the short session will do little else than pass the regular appropriation bills. The regular Republicans declare: "Well, we will get the routine out of the way." The routine being the nu merous appropriation bills. The Democrats say: "Well, let's •cc what the Republicans will do. Our turn comes next year." The insurgents say: "We are here to fight for progressive legislation, if we can get the chance." Bills to Clean Up. The big thing staring the legisla tors in the face is cleaning up the ap propriation bills, of which there are It. President Taft has been calling on the department beads for economy and he is expected to continue tbe process with the legislators. Until these bills are cleaned up it is pretty certain that nothing in the way of general legislation will be attempted. 

SECRETARY BALLINGER MAY BE IMPEACHED Washington.—A resolution for tne Impeachment of Secretary Ballinger haa been proposed and may be Introduced in the house at any time its introduction is timely. If the min ority report, censuring Ballinger, is adopted by the house, the impeach ment resolution will follow almost Immediately, perhaps at the same time tbe minority report is adopted. The probability that the house will follow that course by a combination between insurgents and Democrats worries tbe administration very much. If the house should impeach, the sen ate must, under the constitution, sit aa Judge on the house charges. Only a change In the present situa tion can prevent the house from Adopting the report censuring Ballln for, and it is argued that then the house must go on to impeachment or be inconsistent.

Members of tbe peace commission returning to Chihuahua reported that their work was greatly embarrassed by the fact that soldiers followed at their heels. At Guerrero, Just as they were beginning to talk with the in surrectos, a peon arrived with word that the soldiers were on the way, whereupon the meeting promptly came to an end. Main Grievance Against State. At Guerrero, and also at San Anto nlo, the commissioners were told that the main grievance is against the state government rather than against Diaz. Seemingly authentic reports state that Guerrero has been taken by the revolutionists with some loss of life. Details are lacking. It is reported that General Plata, commanding this military zone. Is to be succeeded by General Juan Hernandez immediately It is learned that the peace com mission which left Chihuahua to treat with the insurrectos was acting un der the authority of Governor San chez, and not President Dias.

OFFICIALS UNDER FIRE Spokane.—For the purpose of inves tigating charges of graft, malfesance in office, general discrimination and other offenses laid against the offl cials of Spokane county and city, a special grand jury has been called for Monday, January 16. This decision was reached Friday night by a meet ing held en bane of five Spokane county judges, when the complaint and request of E. V. Lambert, presi dent of the city council, and of the officers of various labor organizations were taken up for consideration. The petitions of the labor council call for investigations of city officers and the police department, especially because of numerous charges made against these in the last few months, growing out of heated controversies and apparently important findings through its investigation of ex-Acting Chief of Police John T.

Enum NEW METHOD OF REMOVING STUMPS The article below, reprinted frOil the Bellingham Herald has already been printed by many of our exchang es. it is good news for mauy of eui farmers who still have large Stumpi to remove, and coming as it does trot our Agricultural School at Pullman the method is worth trying. That logged -off lands can be clear ed of stumps, removing roots to 6 depth below the reach of a plow, and ut a cost of less than 50 cents a stump has beeu demonstrated by tht experiments of Prof. EL W. Sparks ol the State college at Pullman. The re salt of these experiments is being spread broadcast among the farmer* and owners of logged-off lands. Prof. Sparks' successful experiment! nave been with the char-pit method Once understood this method is t!u most simple and inexpensive that can !>e imaginod. A little fire, a little watchfulness are the essentials in tl ( process by the combination of which the most hopeless looking stumpy Bcr ige can be prepared for the plow In the course of two weeks. Public demonstration of the char-p:' method were given early this mont'i at the University of Washington, si Georgeto-.cn, a suburb of Seattle, and 'tt Kirkland on Lake WashinjrtOH Many people interested In land clear ing, agriculture, conservation and ki' - irod subjects followed tbe progress oi 'hese demonstrations with great inter est and at the end there was no dis sent from the verdict that a ekeap md practical method of removing stumps has at last been devised. That chnr-pit method is simply at adaption of the old and well-know: method of making charcoal by burr - ing in closed pits. It depends for its efficiency on concentration of bent. \ ring of loose wood, bark, etc.. is first laid all the way round the stump ci ts close to It as possible, and this Is then covered to a depth of about sb 1 M.

Th e wood is then '.ghteu %i this point and left for abou kit a.i hour until the fire is w e ll star J. when this hole is then covered up like the rest. As the fire burns back no the stump the blanket of earth j met be kept right up ti the stump; s i that the fire never has an oppor tunity to break out. The top of the -tump doesn't burn but is simply cut ft cleanly, at a point about level with the top of the earthen blanket. When the top has been cut off by ie fire and rolls off the whole crown iif the stump should be covered with firth, and can then be left without J : inch further attention until the roots have been burned out. and this is - 'iuetimes done to a depth of fifteen feet or more. The length of time requited to de roy tbe stump depends on what kin f wood it is and whether green, dry i' rotten. The most stubborn stumps will disappear in two weeks at tbej lost, while many are done away with n three or four days. The record of I'rofessor Sparks' experiments shows n average cost of between 40 and M nts a stump. In some of these he aa used fuel oil and coal tar. The experiments which have so far --en successful have been with clay .-■oil. This baked and hardened by the "c conserves the highest degree of •at. Sandy or stony soil sifts in and • uts out the fire or permits it to spread. Proffessor Sparks is now work ing out certain theories by which he xpects to perfect a similar method . da.pt ed to other soils than clay. The practicability of the char-pit method means much to the owner of igged-off lands and will undoubtedly •ad to larger settlement upon and cultivation of such lands. 

MARY BAKER EDDY DEAD Announcement It Made in Mother Church—End of Individual Control Boston.—Mrs. Mary Baker Glover Eddy, discoverer and founder of Chris tian Science, is dead, after an illness of nine days. Announcement of the passing of the venerable leader, which occurred late Saturday night at her home at Chestnut Hill, was made at the morning service of the mother church in this city Sunday. Mrs. Eddy was born in Bow, N. H., July 16, 1821, and was therefore in her 90th year. Individual control or management of the Christian Science Church as practiced by Mrs. Eddy will never MRS. MARY BAKER GLOVER EDDY 4gain be vested in one person, accord ing to the opinion of Howard C. Vac Meter, of the committee on publica tion in this city, who viewed, with some understanding of the situation, the chances that are almost certain to follow her death. "The board of directors of the mother church, the First Church o. Christ Scientist in Boston, is suf ficient to the movement, so far as the needs of its organization are con cerned," said Mr. Van Meter last night." The number of Christian Science adherents in 1910 is estimated at 1,- --000,000. Mr. Fisfc of Bellingham, Is the book keeper for the Farmers' Mercantile Co since Monday. He will move his fami ly to Lynden and make this place his home. W. H. Elder, the former book keeper is now at work in the Tribune office. NO BATTLESHIP FLEET Coast Will Not Be Pretected Until Canal Opens. Washington. —The Pacific Coast will not get a battleship fleet until the Panama Canal is completed, accord ing to the annual report of the Sec retary of the Navy. This is a reiter ation of statements made by Secre tary Meyer on his recent tour of tht Coast. An eg lally important feature of thf Secretay's report is his free and frank criticism of the two navy-yards on the Pacific Coast, both of which, In his judgment, were poorly located, the Puget Sound yard because of its dis tance from any large city, and the Mare Island navy yard because oi shallow water, rendering it valuelese in the repair of battleships and heavy cruisers, and also because of its re moteness from San Francisco.

BOARD WANTS APPROPRIATION Improvement at Various In stitutions Call for Large Expenditures. Olympla.—lf the Orting Home li continued, 13,421,216 will be tbe total of tbe budget for tbe State Board of Control, or in event tbe Soldiers' Home at Orting is consolidated with tbe Veterans' Home at Port Orchard, $3,60u,657 will be the total the board will asa of the legislature at the next session. In addition the five higher educa tional institutions are asking for a sum in excess of $2,000,000. These estimates will be submitted by the board to the legislature without rec ommendation. Combining them, the total is $5,500,000, which exceeds that appropriated by the 1908 legislature for the entire state. The State Board of Control is mapping out a system of improve ments at the various state institutions that calls for a big expenditure. New buildings are wanted at practically every institution and the board would like to see the Port Orchard Veterans' Home deeded by the state to the fed eral government for the establishment of a national home there that would correspond to the one at Santa Mon ica, Cal. The manner in which past legis latures have cut down appropriations for the School for the Blind at Van couver is condemned by the board, which says until recently nothing was provided for them except food and shelter and little attention paid - to their progress. The board says that the building now occupied is obsolete afid asks that it be abandoned entire ly. The board also asks a new ward building for the girls at the School for the Deaf in Vancouver. ELECTION DAY VERY QUIET The town election last Tuesday, was a very quite affair. The only contest was over the Moving picture shows, and Lynden people decided to have moving picture shows on Sunday by a vote of 129 to 95. The names on the caucus ticket were all elected with the following votes: For co mcilmen, Ed. X\napp, 190; J. W. Edwards. 179; Nick Hoerhave, 1.14; For treasurer, W. R. Jones received I*4 votes. There was a little scratching done but the vt tas were scattering. The city election at Anacortes was j a disappointment to the friends of prohibition and of woman's suffrage. lAt the general election with men on -Ily voting the "wet" element carried ' Anacortes by only four votes. One month later at the city election where 280 women voted, the "wet" majori ties are thirty to forty. We sincerely hope this vote does not indicate the general opinion of the women of the state with regard to the saloon.
