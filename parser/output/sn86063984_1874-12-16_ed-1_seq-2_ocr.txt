During this prostration two essential elements or prosperity have been largely unemployed.

Would t not bo Just as honest and prudent to authorlzo each debtor to issue his own Ipgal-tenders to tho extent of hit liabilities as to do this ? Would it not be safer, for fear of an over issue by unscrupulous creditors, to say that all debt obligations are ob literated in tho United Slates, and now wo cominoiico anew, each pos sessing all ho hat at tho time, free from Incumbrance? These proposi tions aro too absurd to bo entertained for a moment bv thinking people. Every dcliy in the preparation of Html resumption partakes oi mis dis honesty, ami is only less in degree as the proposition is held out. A con venient season will at last, arrive for tho good work of redeeming our pledges to commerce.

FORKION URtiATtONfli During the past year nothing has occurred to disturb general frlondly nnd cordial relations of tho United States with other powort. The cor respondence submitted horowllh be tween this government and lis diplo matic representatives of olhor coun tries Indicates the sallsl'actory condi tion of ail questions between tho Uni ted Slates and tho most of these coun tries, nnd with a fow exceptions, to which rcfcrcnco Is hereafter made, ihe absence of any points of differ ence to bo udjtisfcd. Tlio nol Ice directed by tho resolu tion of congress of Juno 17, 1874, to bo given to terminato the convention of July 17, 18o9, bntweon tlio United States nnd Uelgium has been given, and tho treaty will accordingly ter minate on the llrst day of July, 1876. This convention secured to certain Uelgium vessels entering tho ports nt tho United Slates, exceptional privi leges which are not accorded lo our own vessels. Other features of the convention have proved satisfactory, and bavo tended to the cultivation of tho mutually hcucllclul commercial intercourse and friendly relations be tween the twoeouutrles. I hope that tho negotiations Hint have been In vited will result In the celebration of another treaty which may tend to the interests of both countries. KKI.ATIONS WITH CHINA continue to lie friendly. During tho past year the fear ol hostilities be tween China nnd Japan, growing nut or the lauding of an armed force upon Ihn island ot Ionium by the latter, has occasioned uneasiness. It is earn-c-tlv hoped, however, that theditll- cullies arising from this cause will be adjusted, and that Ihe advance of civilization in these empires may not lio retarded uy a stale ot war. in consequence ol i lie part tuiieii by certain citizens of the United States in this expedition our representa tives in tlio-o countries have been in structed to impress upon the govern ments of China nnd Japan Ihe firm intention of the country to maintain strict neutrality lu the'eveut of hos tilities, and carefully prevent any In fraction of law on the part of our citizens. lu connection with this subject I call tho attention of congress lo u generally conceded fact that. Ihe great proportion of Chinese immigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily In make their homes with us and their labor productive of the general prosperity, but como under contract witli head men who own them almost absolutely, lu a worse form does lids apply to Chinese wo men. Hardly a perceptible propor tion of them peiiurm any honorable labor. Hut they are brought for shameful purposes to the disgrace of tho communities where settled, and to tho great demoralization of the youth ol those localities. If this bad practice can bo legislated against, it will be my pleasitreiis well as my duty to ciilorce regulations in secure so de sirable an end. It is hoped that ne gotiations between (lie government j of Japan and the other powers, look ing to the furl her opening of the Kin pi re and to the removal id' various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce the results desired, which cannot tall to inure to the ben ell t ol all parlies. Having on previous occasions sub milled to the consideration of con gress the propriety or the release ot ihe Japanese government from the further payment ot indemnity under tho convention of October '.'-, lHiil, ami as no action had been tuken therein, it became my duly to regard the obligations of the convention as lu force; and as the other powers in terested have received their portion of the indemnity in full, the minister of the United Stales nt Japan has been noli tit.il that this government received the remainder due to the United States under Ihe convention ol Siulousky. 1 submit ihe propri ety of applying the income of a part, if not the whole ot this fund, to Ihe education lu the Japanese language of a number of young niuii to be under obligations to servo the gov ernment for a specllled lime as inter preters at the iegution and the con sulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might al the same time l.o i.duialcd in our vernacular, and bitiietits would result to both governments. The importance of having our own citizens competent and familiar wilh tho language of Japan, to act ns interpreters and lu other capacities connected with tlio legation nnd eotiiiilates in that coun try, cannot readllv bo overestimated. The amount uwnrdod to the gov ernment of (UtIJAT IIIUTAIX by tho mixed commission organized under the acts of tlm treaties nt Wa-hingtou, in set l lenient, of Ihn elaliiMoi llritish subjcctsurisitig from acts committed between April IS, lHtll, nnd April 9, 181).), became pnyn bio under Hie terms ol treaty within the paw year, and was paid upon tho -'1st day of September, 1871. In lids connection I renew niv recommenda tion made at the nooning uf tho last ses-ioii of congress that a special court be created to hear and .doterrulno all clrtlun of allons against tho United States arising from nets committed against the persons or property dur ing tho Insurrection. It appears cqultsblo that opportunity should be ottered for porsousof other tittles to present their claims, nt well as those Uritlih ttihjecti whoso claims were not ndinlssablo under tho Into com mission to tho early decision of n competent tribunal. 1 recommend tho necessary legislation to organize a coui t to dlsposo of those claims or aliens who are referred to, In an equitable and satisfactory muiincr, aud to relievo congress ami tho de partments t ro m tho consideration of theso questions. Tho legislation necessary to extend the colony uf Newfoundland, certain articles ol the treaty ot Washington of the 8ih day or May, 1871, having boon had, a protocol lo that effect was KUggestcd hi behalf of tlio United Stales and Great Britain on the'J8lli ol May lust, and was duly proclaimed on tho following day. A copy of tho proclamation is submitted herewith. A copy of Hie report of tho commis sioner appointed under tho net of March ID, 1S7-, for surveying and marking the boundary between the United Stales and the Uritish posses sions, from the I. ike of the Woods lo the summit of Ihe llocuy Mountains, Is herewith transmitted, lam happy to announce that the Held work of the commissioner has been completed, and an entire Hue from Ihe northwest corner of Luke of tho Woods to the summit of thultoekv Mountains has been run unil marked upon the sur lace of the ourtli. It is believed that the amount remaining unexpended uf the nimronriatioii made at the lust session of congress will be stillklcut lo complete the woi k. i recommend that tho authority of congress be given lo tho uso of the unexpended balance ot tho ntinroprlalion on the completion of ihe work of the com mission in making the report ami printing necessary maps. The court known as the court ot commissioner of the Alabama claims, created by an act of congress al the last session, has organized auilcomineticed tiieir worK and It is to bu hoped that the claims admissible under the provisions of the act may be speedily administered. it lias lieeu deemed anvisamo 10 ex ercise the discretion conicrred upon the executive at the last session, by accepting the condition required by the government ol lui Key tor me privilege of allowing citizens of Ihe United States to hold real estate in the former country, and by assenting ton certain change ol Ihe Jurisdiction of the courts in the latter. A copy ot the proclamation upon those subjects is herewith communicated. OTJIKIl AMttlllCAN 10
