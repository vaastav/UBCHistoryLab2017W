<f bt Styplitriisiohm Tuftsin. H. L. SNYOER, Editor and Proprietor, Shkphkrdstown, W. Va. Thursday, December 9, 1897. The noblest mind the best contentment has."?Spenser. So far aa Cuba and Spain are con- j cerned, the President isn't much of a ' jingoist. It is observable that the jails in West Virginia are in a quite leaky condition. Speaker Reed says that there will be little general legislation at the pres* ent session of Congress. That settles it. A good many Congressmen will discover when they get to Washington that there are other pebbles on the beach. Some Congressmen appear to think they are saving the country where they are introducing bills. It is a harmless diversion. They say that up in New York David B. Hill is so unpopular he couldn't get as much as a job on the police force. Our State officials don't seem to fit their places?most ?f them are several sizes too small. And the places are not so very big, either. We don't think Speaker Reed is doing right by keeping Congress in idleness. Put 'em to work, Mr. Reed, for Satan finds mischief for idle hands. The distinguished Congressman from the third district of West Virginia, Hon. C. P. Dorr, is out in a published interview bitterly opposing civil service. This almost makes us favor it. The Charlestown Free Press truthfully remarks that a newspaper helps every business man in the town where it is published ; but there are plenty of business men who don't help the newspaper. A bill has been introduced already in the House of Representatives to repeal the civil service laws. There'll be a deal of talk on this subject, but we again predict that civil service is here to stay. It is generally agreed that the President's message to Congress is an excellent State paper and a very sensible document in every respect. But who expected anything else from a sensible man surrounded by sensible advisers ? Since Bill Dave Goshorn has announced his intention of leaving Charleston there are rumors that emigration may become general in certain classes. There are some who will do well to keep right on until they reach Canada. The Cotton Manufacturers' Association, at a meeting in Fall River, Mass., yesterday, decided to make a general cut of 10 per cent iu the wages of operatives, to go into effect the 1st of January. The reduction will affect 28,000 persons. Here's more prosperity for you. There is a good deal of objection to the proposal of the President to appoint Attorney-General McKenna to a poaitioi on the Supreme Bench. It is said he is not a good lawyer. "We consider it more important, however, to know whether he is liable to change his mind after he once gives a decision. The Martinsburg Sfalesjnmi does j'ut uu an a ?iicii it a vxiauv^. The other day some wild fowl were so unfortunate as to get belated in Martinsburg, whereupon the Statesman gets off a most learned and scientific discourse, calling the poor birds Podicipedid&'-Grebes.and Podilimbus-Piedbilled. We suspect they were just plain ducks. The Fairmont Index, which is good authority, says: "We understand from a gentleman who is in a position to know, and who favors an extra session 1 of the Legislature, that an extra session 1 will bewailed. That they only need two names to have the necessary threefifths of the members to the call, and j they know where they can get those tw# names. God save the State !" - ___ __-L_ i Secretary Gage has suggested a 1 plan for what he believes will be an improvement in our currency system, i He proposes that our greenbacks be , redeemed, and that thereafter they be i disbursed only for gold. His argument seems to be a good one, and , whether it will work well or not it is a change. A good many people would favor it on this account, if for no other reason. It is said that Congressman Dorr 1 again visited the President last week to urge him to remove Mrs. Kenna from the postoffice at Charleston. The President, however, again refused to take immediate action, much to Dorr's : disgust. We hope that the President will put courtesy and kindness above partisanship and retain Mrs. Kenna. . She is a goed woman and a good postmaster, her record showing that the Charleston office ranks among the twelve best-managed postoffices in the United States. Anyhow, Dorr ought to be turned down. President McKinley's Message. President McKinley's message to Congress was a lengthy document. The subject of greatest importance is the revision of the currency. He says that Congress ought not to hesitate now to enter upon a reform of the currency which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. It is manifest, he says, that we must de- 1 vise some plan to protect the govern- 1 ment against bond issues for repeated ; redemptions. If this evil is not corrected by legislation, the president suggests that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized by Congress to sell bonds at long or short periods bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. The President also recommends that, as soon as the receipts of the government are ffiatMii MS *>" amimc.ia all Slimcieill IU J'ay an tAj i uovu, .. . . United States notes, after their redemption in gold, shall be set apart and only be paid out again for gold. The President invites careful consideration by Congress of Secretary Gage's plan to protect the gold reserve, aud concurs with the Secretary that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of their bonds deposited ; that the circulating tax be reduced to one-half of one per cent, and that national banks may be established with a capital of $25,000. He also recommends that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 and upwards, and that they be required to redeem their notes in gold. The President devotes much space in his message to a consideration of the Cuban question. He outlines his recent instructions to Minister Woodford, which were to impress upon the Spanish government the sincere wish of the United States to aid in terminating the war by peaceful methods, accomplishing a result which would be just and honorable to Spain and to the Cuban people. He says that it is honestly due to Spain that it be given a reasonable time in which to test its new policy. Present conditions in ,l? iiic+iftr ropncrnihnn of VUUa KA\J I1V/V V ? ~ the belligerent rights of the insurgents, nor of their independence. The President heartily favors the annexation of Hawaii. The opinion is expressed that by reciprocity arrangements under the tariff act the volume of our commercial exchanges may be enlarged. The President urges speedy legislation to procure armor for the three battleships now building, and says that for a time any increase in the na/al equipment should take the form of increased facilities for our vessels. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. Referring to the civil-service law, the President says the system has the approval of the people, and it will be his endeavor to uphold and extend it. At the same time the President declares that he shall not hesitate to exempt cases which bethinks have been improperly included in the classified service, or to include those which, in his judgment, will best promote the good of the service. In conclusion the President urges Congress not to encourage the increase of the estimate for the maintenance of the government. Some months ago, for some reason unknown to us, our always interesting contemporary, the Lincoln Citizen, cut us from its exchange list, and since that time we haven't heard a word about the Siases and Biases. This week we were gratified beyond measure to find the Citizen again upon our desk, printed in handsome new type, its advertisements set up in up-to-date style, and its general get-up right up to the notch. We congratulate Messrs. Haddox and Mahone on their excellent paper, and hope'that they will never again forsake us. To show that the Citizen is just as spicy as ever, we need quote only a few of the many items with which its columns are filled: Will take produce on subscription. Warren Ilolley is a good auctioneer. L. M. Reynolds and his mules were in town, Wednesday. Arch Egnor and son. Robert, were in town this week. It is said Mr. Egnor is looking for another wife. We have fought fire and run newspapers all our life, but we can't see any difference between the two. Morris Lattin says there will be a box supper and 'possum roast at Thompson's Hotel, on Snodgras street and Bias avenue, Thackertown, Saturday night. Judge Faulkner had a siege of it getting through with the Jefferson court. The criminal docket was unusually large, and therefore much civil business was delayed.?Martinsburg Independent. It is true the criminal docket at the present term of court was large?due in great measure to the long interval (from May to November) between terms?but Judge Faulkner has been dispatching business at a lively rate, and with the aid of Prosecuting Attorney Brown made comparatively short work of the crimiual docket. There have been fourteen jury trials of State cases, and seveu prisoners sentenced to the penitentiary. Four divorces have been granted. The pleadings in common law cases have been argued and determined and cases set for trial at February term, the eutire appeal docket (including seven of the celebrated "flour bin" cases) has been disposed of, and the court is now engaged in calling and hearing the chancery docket, with prospects of closing the term in a day or two more.?Spirit.

Gerling, late sheriff of Berkeley county, made his annual settlement, showing a balance of $767.29 still due the county.

Alexander Davis was digging a nole for a derrick to erect the Massachusetts State Monument when he found the body of a Union soldier. The bones, shoes and buttons were in a good state of preservation ; and small bits of the blanket were also recognizable. The teeth were all intact and the bones of the feet were still encased in the shoes.?Keedysville Record. Consolidation canal boat No. 126, laden with coal, Capt. A. D. McCardell, sunk in the Chesapeake and Ohio canal at Cuslnva's wharf, Williamsport, early yesterday morning, while Captain McCardell and wife were aboard asleep. James Hetzler, whose boat was moored close by, discovered that Captain McCardell's boat was sinking and aroused him in the rear cabin. The water was then lapping the bunk Captain and Mrs. McCardell occupied. The Captain leaped suddenly from the bunk in the dark and found himself waist deep in water. He rescued his wife through the cabin window. Mrs. Mary Funk, wife of Phillip II. Funk, committed suicide last Friday afternoon at her home in Hagerstown, by hanging herself with a rope and a strap thrown over a door. She fastened the rope to the latch on the other side of the door, threw the rope across the door, put the loop around her neck while standing on a chair, kicked the chair from under her and was strangled to death, with her head not more than a foot from the lloor and touching a flight of steps. She was fiftyseven years old. Mrs. Funk's daughter, Miss Loula B. Funk, died five weeks ago of blood-poisoning, caused by picking a pimple 011 her face. H?r death was a great shock to her mother, who told neighbors she would soon follow and threatened to commit suicide. Of late Mrs. Funk's mind and health were impaired. A Damage Suit For $25,000. Parkersburq, W. Va., Dec. 0.? The case of J. F. Mock vs. the Ohio River Railroad Company for $25,000 damages is now being heard at the Circuit Court. The declaration alleges that Mr. Mock was superintendent of bridges and buildings on the Ohio River Railroad in and prior to 1890, and that lie was sent from here to Wheeling with a party of Baltimore and Ohio officials in a special train, composed of Baltimore and Ohio and Ohio River Railroad cars, on June G, 1S90, and that in an accident he received serious injuries, his skull being crushed and ribs broken. The injury to his head rendered him insane, and he remained in that condition until 189G, when experts removed a portion of his skull which caused insanity, but that he has been left a physical wreck in consequence. Mr. J. F. Legge, of Shepherdstown, who was then a superintendent on the B. & 0. Railroad, was in the same accident, and sustained very severe injuries. In Memory of Miss Susannah Muck. A til iction is passed, the heaven-born spirit is lied, Her wish she fully has gained, And now she is intombed with the dead. The days and the months of distress are over. We see her in anguish no more, She has gained her happy relief. No sickness, 110 sorrow, no pain, Will ever disquiet her now. Death to her spirit is gain, Since Christ was her life when below, Her victory she does now obtain. She has gone her dear Saviour to see, To mansions in glory above, To mingle with the angels of life, And dwell in a kingdom of love. We shall soon behold her again, Renewed and redoubled in delight. How to Prevent Pneumonia. At this time of the year a cold is very easily contracted, and if let to run its course without the aid of some reliable cough medicine is liable to re- ' suit in that dread disease pneumonia. We know of no better remedy to cure a cough or cold than Chamberlain's Cough remedy. We have used it 1 quite extensively and it has always ' given entire satisfaction.?Oolagah, Ind. Ter., Chief. This is the only remedy that is ] known to be a certain preventive oi pneumonia. Among the many thous- ' ands who have used it for colds and la grippe we have never yet learned of a single case having resulted in pneumonia. Persons who have weak lungs or have reason to fear an attack of pneumonia, should keep the remedy at hand. The 25 and 50 cent sizes for sale by J. G. Gibson, druggist. Ex-Senator Blanche K.

WAYS] The bladder was created for one pur- < pose, namely, a receptacle for the urine, 1 and as such it is not liable to any form | of disease except by one of two ways, l The first way is from imperfect action 1 of the kidneys. The second way is from , cart-less local treutment of other diseases. ^ CHIEF CAINE. 1 Unhealthy urine Trom unhealthy kidneys is the chief cause of bladder troubles. So the womb, like the bladder, J was created for one purpose, and if not ^ doctored too much is not liable to weakness or disease, except in rare cases. It is situated back of and very close to the . bladder, therefore any pain, disease or inconvenience manifested in the kid- neys, back, bladder or urinarv passage is often, by mistake, attributed to female weakness or womb trouble of some sort. The error is easily made and may be as J easily avoided. To lind out correctly, ?J set your urine aside twenty-four hours; a < sediment or settling indicates kidney or bladder trouble.
