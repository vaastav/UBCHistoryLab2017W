MONDAY,DKCKMBKR 14. 1K^1. Thismorning's London dispatches^brinpr the announcement that the di^^rectors of the Montana 15uhy Mines^company have rallied their approval of^the purchase of tlie jirojicrty where^Montana's precious stones ahound.^There has been a Rood deal of doubt^ohoitt the value of these ircins, and tIn^^action of the company tends to set^these doubts at rest. At any rate^the company is convinced that the^principal ingredient of Montana's^ruhies and sapphires is not paste or^any composition of that nature. Such^as they are. Montana's precious stones^Maud mi their own bottom, and that^they are deemed worthy to compete^with the stones of foreign countries is^gratifying intelligence. Accordingto reports in the Xew^York newspa|MTs. the I.oppy execu^tion at Sing sing last week was as far^from a success as any of the electrical^executions that preceded it. The vic^^tim continued to breathe after the tirst^shock had been given, his pulse l^eat distinctlyafter thestml shock.and it wasonly w hen the current had been^turned on fur the third time that evi^^dences of life ^^eased. Hi. McDonald,^who was present, says that four shocks^were given, instead of three, as was at^tirst reported. The entire time of the^execution was six minutes. This is^not a ^|iiick death, anil the evidence is^all against the claim that it is painless.^So far as the half dozen experiments^already made go to show, it is iinpos^siblc t^^ kill a man instantly by elec^^tricity. The New York press is clam^oring for the re|^-al ^if the law and one^of the tirst acts of the new legislature^is likely !^ be that very thing. Lastsummer the Sr.\M^.\itl^'^ news^columns told of impending trouble be^tween a small camp of Kootenai hid^ians on ltayton ( reek and the white^settlers of that region, licectit dis^^patches from Arlee go to indicate that^the hour of the trouble is not far off.^lteccntly the Flathead Indian agent,^ucting upon orders from Washington,^located nineteen families of Kootenai^Indians on a tine stretch of hind along^the banks of Itayton ( reek. The liul^ians did nut make the move until they^were reiniested by Agent Ibmaii. who^has much imlueiice over them. A few^days ago u baud of white settlers from^that region, armed with Winchesters^ap|icarcd in the little camp, for^cibly drove the-e nineteen families olf^and .lumped the laud. It was with^much ditliciilty, it is said, that the^old men of the tube prevented the^bot-blooded young bucks from making^a tight for their newly acquired homes.^This action M the part of the white^settlers was very ill advised. The^government gave tlmse lauds to the^Indians, and the settler's protests^should be directed to Ibe authorities^at Wasliingtiin. Nothing can be^gained by these t\vcnt\ live or thirty^dissatisfied settlers attempting to un^do a! the muzzle of the Winchester^what the federal authorities have^done. It must lie remembered that^the Indians are not there by choice but^by request. chnese at HOME and abroad. M'hiletheChinese question has a^local significance fur the |ieople of^Montana in these days, not a little in^terest is being taken in the lierce revo^liitiniiury struggle now w aging in the^heart uf the Mower) kingdom. Me lung^us the hluody work of evterininat mn^was coiilined tu the Chinese teU ls and^the loyal subjects of the young em^^peror, people in these parts who are^acquainted with the characteristics of^the celestial found little cause for con^rem: but the brutal outrages com^^mitted upon missionaries and other^foreigners in ^ hina lends a dliferent^aspect 1o the atlair. Whilethe Chinamen have been here,^many of them in contravention of the^law . and all in opposition to the desires^of the people of tin v t :it e. our laws asa^rule have MM prompt and vigorous in^meeting out punishment toany Ameri^^can citizen who has I ecu guilty of the^smallest outrage against them. Cuiu-^plete protection has bMU granted in^this state, ut least. to t he Chinese who^find t heir homes within our boundaries.^Our methods haw b^en peaceful in^resisting their MfnkioM MBMMt)^there seems no reason to doubt that^the contest will be continued ii|hiu^these lines. The citizens- of Muntana^have about made up their minds that^the Chinese must go. and if the proper^measures are taken to cnfoicetheedict^there need Is- little doubt as to the^termination. In its local phases the^Cfcijiese question interests us much:^but the dispatches from Takiou and^other |Miints in the Chinese empire^also furnish subjects for concern.^The butchery uf dtleiHciess^missionaries hv the noting jj,.^surgents tmds not even one poor rea^miii for justification. It is butchery,^plain and unprovuked. whieh should^call lor prumpt and oV ei.-ivc net ion on thepart of the nations of which the^murdered men and women were sub^^jects. Itis a fact of history that nearly all^revolutionary outbreaks in China in^modern times have licen preceded by^unprovoked and liendish outrages upon^the hapless foreigners in that land, it^was so with the Tia I'mg outbreak in^IS.VJ. in the suppression of which the^lamented Cordon performed such^valiant service for the cm |M*ror. The^sufferings of the obsclire missionary in^China since the introduction into that^heathen land of Christianity nine bun^dred years ago will never be realized.^The Sling dynasty. Iictter known to^students of history as the native^Chinese dynasty, was established early^in the thirteenth century. Ilefore its^blighting power Christian inlliiciice^went down. Two(cnturies and a half have now^elapsed since the Ming dynasty was^overthrown by the Tartars or Mant-^choos. under whose sway Christianity,^reestablished by the .lesuites. has long^done battle with varying f ortune. The^^ 'hristian congregat ions in ^ 'hina to-day^are largely Catholic, it being in the^present century only that Protestant^and Creek missionaries have turned^their faces upon ^ 'hina. Thereis a queer political Udief cher^^ished by the native Chinese to the^elfect that the reign of the present^MMMOf, K Wang-su.will be the last^of the rule of their Tartar conquerors.^It is said that this faith has |m-rnieated^all their meetings social, political and^religious and it is ev idently upon this^line that the present insurgents are^lighting it out. From recent dispaldies^it appears that the young cni)icror.^however, is mure than holding his own.^He has control of the army that is^composed, ollicers and men. almost en^^tirely of ardent supporters of the^K-Wangsii element or the Tartar^dynasty. Welook for the struggle to increase^in hcrci uess and bloodiness as time^advances, and. whatever the outcome,^the lives and property of the Ameri^^cans and Kuropeans who are so unfor^^tunate as to be in that barbarous land^will not be safe from molestation until^vigorous action is taken by the out^^raged nations. Whencongress was in agitation over^the silver question the average priceof^the metal was liM.tC, per MM* The^new silver law was passed duly II,^IS'.iti. Wall street was prepared for^speculation and congress had its fa^^mous silver pool. The qiiutatiuu on^the day w hen the law went into cffccl^was P4JW, during early August it was^81.14, on August I'.i it was 81.21. and^that was the highest figure. The arti^^ficial stimulus which active HMllB*^tion had given was then exhausted, the^legislation on silver began to work ma^normal way and down went the daily^quot.it ions, lie fore the end of the^year IHWt the price was81.tM.in June^MM.HWM 9iM, fOf last mouth the^average was'.Mi cents, oti (he day after^the reading of the president's message^the quotation was H cents. In the^face of this declining career for the^metal. I'resident Harrison meeklv re^^mark; li ^I hope that tbe depression in^the priceof silver is temporary and^that a farther trial of the existing law^will more favorably allect it.^ I'oor^Tellow. Ittakes an expert to understand the^administration's pension figures. Con^gress sent the government's bounty up^to a mark which, it was announced^twelve mouths ago. would call for an^annual appropriation of glftjOOOjWAi^Last year the secretary of fhe interior^said that the law might require for its^immediate execution a sum nol less^than iMD/OOOglODO, but that the demands^of the pension office would, within^thirty mouths, drop to gMOjOOtyOttH^This year the secretary of the treasury^estimates that for the lisc.il year end^^ing June IB, |V.Ct, (he appropriation^must be si IT.i^^i.iurn while, in his an^^nual message, the president remarks^that a careful estimate calls for sill,^BOO/HQ l^r pensions for the same^period. Two \ears ago the tutal pen^^sion appropriat mn was far below one^hundred millions, and at that the^policy of the government was deemed^to be extremely liberal. 

AMERICAS DISADVANTAGE^A good deal of fun has been poked^of late at l'rof. ^ arl K. Mxers. an I^ro-^MMtlKI engineer, whatever that la.^whoemrtM that most of the Furo-^pean powers are already splendidly^equipped with lying machines for use^in war. while the I nihil Males in this^rcs|ieet is completely at their mercy.^The professor is out with a letter in^which he reiterates his statements and^goes even farther. It appeals that^Fiiglaud. Fiance. Italy. Idissiu. tier-^many and possibly other KuropMH^powers possess ^well organized con^^st i net ions and school departments^ in^which the principles of a ronautics iu^their relation to the art of^war are laught with assiduity and^success. The^ - have sleerable airslii|ie^loaded with the most powerlul explo^^sives and inflammable compounds.^^and all I hey w ill have to do in t he e\ cut^of a war is to sail over an enemy's city^and drop dynamite into it hv t lie tun. Thisis anything but a DtMMHl con^^dition fur the I nited States tn contem^^plate, part icularly in view of the fact^that the resources of our war depart^^ment do not include anything of the^kind. Kngland. for instance, could be^blot t ing out our eil ics from t he In e of^the earth, one at a time, with certainty^and dispatch, while the best ue could^beihung Would be boullSrdillg her few^cities and villages on the coast. And^how long would our highest and most^powerful armored MW M able lu^stand a rani of dynamic from the^heavens IMacedat such a di^ad\au'age what^on earth is the use of talking about Ubprovingour inu and nevy anv way' Hotter drop the whole hnsinc-a^at once ami go to building airships big^enough and fleet enough to MM with^those of Furope. The SOMO of mili^^tary operations has been transferred^from the earth to the sky. There isn't^any doubt about it. ^I repent.'says^Professor Myers, ^that foreign nations^possess these means and military^schools for the purpose of educating^men inthoirusc. I'ndoubtcdly we can^equal all this in time, but we are in no^sense prepared to cope with them. The^I nited States possesses no plant for^such constructions, ami at present we^have no private facilities for sis-eddy^furnishing aeronautical war apjiaratus^on the scale demanded for sudden^emergencies' Myall means let the professor's rec^^ommendations Ik- adopted. Let us^have such a plant and let us establish^such schools and catch on as speedily^as possible. The only obstacle that^presents itself lies iu the ililli-^cultv of getting an airship that^will' sail the air. but |sissibly^Myers has one, or has thought out the^construction of une and needs only a^congressional appropriation to put this^country on an equal footing with those^across the Atlantic. And if Yankee^ingennlij cannot master the construc^^tion of such a vessel unaided, it should^at least be able to beg, borrow or steal^one of t he blamed things from some^Furopean power for a pattern. Itis much to lie hoped, by the way.^that Chili is nol in possession of any^such disagreeable implements of war^^fare just yet. M'N.K-J.Mk 4, A
