The question of building and the material for buildings is al We know what it takes to put up any structure We know because we have had the ex £833 £38 £833 >3F £38 £833 vM ways on our mind, from the ground up. perience that comes from having done the work of construction and we know because we have sold thousands of building mater ials and because we are studying everything along the lines of the lumber business and architecture. £38 '0 £38 (££• £s33 £38 £0B3 m Our work on the various buildings in Grenada and Grenada county and in the many other counties in north Mississippi, is a living testimony to what we know about architecture. Only recently we put up a handsume building for some gentlemen at the State University. We are now erecting a new school building for the town of Winona. Another testimony to the Lockett Lumber Co. is the hundreds of buildings put up from material from our yards. We buy in BIG 

LOTS and hence get the very lowest prices and it has been our policy to give our customers the benifit of our success and good luck in buying. The time to buy lumber and to arrange for any buildings you are likely to need is NOW for the reason that THE TENDENCY OF LUMBER PRICES IS UP. We can furnish anything and everything needed in the way of building materials. Besides, the different grades and classes of lumber we have nails, lime and cement, brick, sash, doors etc. £38 v £38 id 4 £38 £33(3 £38 £833 > £833 £38 C! ! £833 § ! £38 £333 n £38 m £38 35*., £38 £838 wry WE ARE PREARED to ACCOMODATE OURSELVES to the CUSTOMERS NEEDS. £38 £838 £833 mk LOCKETT LUMBER CO. •C^t £38 £83(3 GRENADA, MISSISIPPI C. E. LOCKETT, Prop. 6®3 i*K<i , Tt W sS < )ne of our exchanges stale- that a gentleman in a certain town on seeing two very beautiful young ladies kiss each other, remarked that he always believed in taking a woman's part and that he ob jected to seeing a woman doing a man's work. A western exchange says that the statement was made in its town a few days ago that a certain man lost 130 pounds in one day; the explanation of which wa- that the court had granted his wife a divorce that day. The sadde-t things in life, according to the Sedgwick ( Mo.) 1 'antagraph, are men without manhood, women without womanhood and children without childhood. The man who depends on getting through by the skin of his teeth stays on the other side. Submarines and Aeroplanes Star Actors. The big guns and the gas bombs have been in the spotlight at intervals, but submarines and air craft are unmis takably the star actors in the present war. For the first time each has a record of really practical work and - valuable results. In the air. the aero 1 plane is acknowledged to be the real dependence. Ae predicted in these pages a pear before the war, the dir igible as a war weapon can be counted a failure. True, a tew trips have been mad? in good weather, crossing the English Channel, and dropping a few bombs, which have in the whole year's war killed less than 200 people, and these mostly women and children. For a large fleet, each vessel of which cost $500,000 or over, this cannot be consid ered much in the way of result. No battle has been won or even affected by use of a dirigible. It has unquestion ably been an awful nightmare to the British, but when the worst it has done and all it has accomplished are summed up, the dirigible to date must be de clared more a menace than a real dan der, arid largely a fiasco. In fact, every German dirigible which has crossed in to England has easily recruited 10,000 men to the British colors. Therefore, on account of cost, dependence or good weather, its size as a mark, and small results, it is now fairly well estab lished that the dirigible, as a military weapon, has lost out. The aeroplane, on the contrary, that far-reaching eye that sees over moun tains and around corners, has more than justified itself. Within the zone of ac tivities an army can 110 longer begin any important change of base, or ad vance, or even start a retreat, without its being almost instantly known to the enemy. The perilous work of the spy, so important a few years ago, is now largely taken over by the aviation corps, for a single aeroplane with one pilot and an observer can in fifteen minutes bring in more accurate infor mation than a dozen spies could secure in twenty-four hours, with the addi tional great advantage of the report being right up to the minute. And as for bomb dropping, if homes and hos pitals and churches are still to be de stroyed in so dastardly a fashion, the aeroplane is capable of enough mis chief to quite compete with the dirig ible. The aeroplane is so small a mark, j hard to see, and can change its j so course so suddenly and often, that the aerial guns have fallen far snort of their expected efficiency. While the submarine has sent a large number of unarmed merchant and pas senger boats to the bottom, it has as yet, perhaps for want of opportunity, shown meager results as against men of-war. All life is alert to protect it self against attack and destruction. As Burbank says, the cactus had no spine until it was threatened with an nihilation by antelopes, and the sub marine had free hand until recently. Already means have been devised which tend to limit the possibilities of under sea craft. They are taken like fish in wire nets; they are set upon by a mos quito fleet of small speed boats, armed with one-pounders, when they show themselves. On the other hand, the submarine has demonstrated most sat isfactory abilities for long voyages, as, for instance, one of our own subma rines recently made the voyage from San Francisco to Honolulu, a distance of 2.000 miles, without once stopping its engines. However, for protection of our enormous coast line, a large fleet
