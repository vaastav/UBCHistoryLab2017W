An Investigation, made at Blllbld, where prisoners who had been Inoculated with cholera serum, recently died, has disclosed traces of plague germs In the dead bodies. No formal report on the result of the investigation has been made and the government has rr ached no decision In the matter. It is asserted that tubes containing plague germs and others filled with cholera serum, which are so much alike that it Is almost Impossible to distinguish them apart, were mixed In the laboratory by a visitor who examined the plague germs and by mistake placed them In a rack with the serum tubes. This Is said to have occurred during the temporary absenco of Dr. R. P. Strong of the bureau of science, who has been conducting ex periments and Inoculation of persons with cholera serum to test Its efficacy.

The defense has entered mora vogorously upon the general attempt of discrediting the testimony of witnesses for the govern ment and this was one move In thia gen eral plan. The affidavit further stated that the affi ant never saw Tom Huntington to talk to him. The document bears data of August 17, 1906, and waa sworn to before A. J. Dole, a Justice of the peace of St. John's township, ilarrlson county, Iowa. Telia Same Old story. In his goneral testimony tha witness told practically the same story that has been repeated by ail tha soldiers who had been solicited to file on the lands by the Hulls at tha Iowa end of the land and Hunt ington, Hoyt and Comstock at the Gulden end of the line. The same general proced ure of malting a visit to the lands, expense free, and all filing fees paid for by Hunt ington or Hoyt, were' gone over' In tire some detail. William H. Tuttle of Woodbine, another old soldier, told practically tha same atory Of having been solicited to make the filing by I'D. Hull? the visit to- Gordon, inter view with Huntington, vlalt to the ranch, subsequent filing at Valentine, all expense free,' and of the leasing of the land for K0 per year and his receipt of $25 for the first Installment of the lease money after his second visit to tha land. Neither dla he take up the land for the purpose of making a home on It, but rather to make what he could out of the land after he had made final proof. The witness waa In clined to much forgetfulness and his al most Invariable reply to questions In the cross-examination waa "I don't remember." R. S. Hall asked the court if there was not some way to compel this witness to answer. Caannt Mako Him Remember. Tha Court If he cannot remember, the court knowa of no way to compel him to remember. Tha witness waa repeatedly asked If ha bad talked with anyone about what ha waa to testify to alnce being about- the federal building. He atated that he had only talked to a few comrades In a general way and asked the court if he should be compelled to make a more explicit answer. Mr. Hall wanted to know. "Why did you ask the oourt If you ahould be compelled to answer T" Tha witnesa did not rerly. merely saying he had not talked to any one In particular, and with no one at all as to what he ahould testify to. John E. Oelger, an old soldier from Lo gan, la., told briefly why ha took up the land In Nebraska. He aald: "I waa told by Hull that an old soldier could take up 040 acres of land without having to live on it and that some cattle company would put improvements on It and pay the expenses of filing and cultivation by the Prussian authorities only In the case of children who know that language. Therefore the conflict ceases to be religious and become political. The pope charged Cardinal Kopp to con vey his warrant greetings to Emperor Williams, expressing the desire of the Vati can to maintain and strengthen the good relations existing between the papal authorities and Germany.

Witness told of the usual visit to the lands said to be those he filed on with a party of four Iowa comrades, and their subsequent return home. He had not been on the land since, nor did ha take It with the purpose of establishing a home on it. Twla Mills flection la Demand. During the early part of last weak ona John F. O'Neill, a friendly" entryman living at Gordon, testified to having pat his filing on a section on which waa lo ' cated the. "Twin Mills," a particularly choice section. This was one of the mid night filings made at Uerrtman before Conimlaslorisr Heath. Tha evident purpose of all of these "friendly filings" was to secure tha choice lands against the general tilings and entries to be made during the big rush. The "Twla Mills" seem tram the evidence produced Monday afternoon, to be the general laud mark around and about Fire broke out In the record room on the second floor of the new pattern factory In the L'nion Pacific shops about 2:30 Mon day afternoon and caused damage to the extent of $lt,ou before It was extinguished by the combined efforts of the entire city department and the Durant Fire company at the shops. Records of the auditing and accounting departments were totally de stroyed, and It la feared that many valua ble patterns were rendered useless by be ing soaked with water. The patterns were on the first floor of the building and were not reached by the flames, but were drenched with streams of water from twenty lines of hose. Tlie patterns repre sent the work of years and the damage In this respect cannot be estimated. One hun dred men were placed at work after the lire waa put out, carefully wiping the patterns with towels, and It Is hoped that In this way the damage may be decreased. The first alarm was sounded about 2:30, but the fire had gained such headway that a second alarm was sent In about 3 p. m. Four hose companies and a truck re- The cardinal will leave here lu lMO ,,rBl niateiy placed at worK unaer me personal direction of Chief Salter. The second alarm brought six more hose companies and two trucks to the scene, some of which came from the outskirts of the city. The fire waa gotten under control In about one hour, but was ono of the most stubborn and diffi cult that the firemen have been called upon to fight for some time. The flames were first discovered by John Nichols, custodian of the record room, who smelled the odor of smoke. With the as sistance of other employes, two lines of hose In the building were laid and di rected on the blaze, but In spite of the prompt measures taken the flames could not be checked and soon enveloped the en tire north end of the building. Fire Starts Near Electric Wire. The record room la situated at the north and of the building on the second floor, and Mr. Nichols said the fire was first sean near the roof, where the electric light wires enter the building. Superintendent of Mo tive Power McKeen was in the bulldlrg when the fire started and assistod In playing the hose on the burning records The, record room Is separated from the south half of the building by a thin par tition, but the flames soon burst through the partition and enveloped the entire sec ond floor in smoke and flames. The records were kept In large wooden files, with narrow corridors between the tiles, which reached from the floor to the roof, and the papers, which were the ac cumulation of many years, burned like tinder. The records were not of nny par ticular value, exeept for statistical pur poses, and tha moat recent papers la the flies were those of 1903, the current records and those of recent years being kept In fire-proof vaults in the general offices. Greatest Damage to Patterns. Superintendent McKeen said: "While the loss to the building will be considerable, the greatest damage has been done to the patterns stored on the first floor. Many of these patterns could not be replaced at any cost and all of them are practically worth their weight in gold. They are made with Infinite care and of the most expensive materials. We hope to save most of thein tonight, when a hundred men will be placed at wiping them off and removing them from the building. "I am thankful that the patterns for the motor cars were not In the building hut were in use In the construction of the cars In the shops." . The fire attracted a large crowd by reason of the dense smoke which emanated, and it waa rumored around the city that the entire shops were burning. The courts adjourned for a few moments to watch the Are, which was plainly visible from the windows of the court house. Chief Salter withdrew the city firemen about 6 o'clock, after having extinguished nearly every sign of a blaze. The railroad officials said they would be able to care for tho property with the Durant depart ment, and rather preferred that their own men take up the work of handling the books and records not burned. spectator Hart by Big- Track. While the fire at tlia shops was still in progress, an alarm was turned in from the Utopia hotel, Eighteenth and Daven port streets, and the outlying companies which had moved in toward tne center of the city when the second alarm was turned In by Chief Salter for the L'nion Pacific fire, answered the call, placing nearly every piece of apparatus In the department In commission. A slight blase was found to be burning between the floors and was extinguished with small loss. The only serious accident reported inci dent to the tire was one in which an on looker, too Intent on seeing what was going on, got In the way of a big hook and ladder truck. The victim waa "Billy" HERKIMER, N. T., Dec. S.-Never per haps In the history of Herkimer county Justice hud the closing scenes of a murder trlnl been characterized by such hitter at tacks of counsel aa developed In the sum ming up of the Gillette esse today. Re plete as the trlnl haa been with surprises and sensation, none wns prepared for the sharp exchange with which the day closed. Judge Devendorf hud expected to give the cse lo the Jury today, but after District Attorney Ward had spoken for fifteen minutes court wms adjourned until to morrow morning. The prosecutor will con clude and the Judge's charge made to morrow, It is expected. Former Senator A. M.

He hnd occupied nearly the whole of the session and It was lye In the day when ne dramatlcaly declared that the five phy sicians who hnd sworn there was a blood clot on Grace Rrown's brain had sworn to a falsehood; that tftey had gotten to gether and apreed on fa common story for the witness stand and deliberately with held testimony favoratile to his client.

With the exception of Representa tive McCarty, the entire Nebraska delega tion wus present when the gavel fell today convening the last session of the Fifty ninth congress. Early In the day Con gressman Kennedy greeted Congressman Pollard, their congratulations extending to a visit of the stork to their respective households, little or nothing being said of the political battle through which they had Just passed, one to go down In defeat, the other having won out. In view of the rule made by the speaker of the house and the serjeant-at-arms of the senate excluding flowers from the desks of members at the opening of the session of congress, there was little to sug gest In the convening of congress today anything more than an ordinary day ses sion, barring the presence of crowded gal- groups of statesmen on the floor of the two houses, telling "how It happened."

SCHOOL BOARD MAY WIN San Francisco Hears Secretary Met calf Will Decloe Adversely to Japaaesc Pupils. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3-The Call says today that School Director D. H. Oliver stated yesterday that Secretary Metcalf, before his departure for Washington, told the school directors that he believed they were clearly within their rights in estab lishing a separate school for Japanese pu pllc. This would tend to correct the Im pression that Secretary Metcalf had de cided to favor the Japanese in his report to the president. The secretary's report, it may be assumed, will conform to his assurances to the school board. Attorneys versed In International law be lieve that the treaty between Japan and America In no way covers the points at issue and the best that the United States can do for the Island empire is to institute a test case In the federal courts, as has already been done. That the matter will be taken to the supreme court for final decision is now quite evident, and If It is decided there that the. Japanese are. Jipt Mongolians, a contention that has Umii made to divert the enforcement of the law requiring that race to be kept in schools separate from white children. It Is quite certain that the state legislature tit Its next sexsion will pass a new law to keep the Japanese out of the schools In which Caucasians are taught. In an Interview yesterday Director Walsh expressed sentiments similar to those of Mr. Oliver.
