PLEA OF JUSTICE HUGHES 4 Calls Attention to Importance of Organized Philanthropy. ANNUAL ELECTION OF OFFICERS Society Made 62,593 Visits During Year?Permanent Employment Given 169 Persons. Tributes to the memory of the late Justice David J. Brewer were paid by his friends in glowing eulogy at the annual meeting of the board of managers of the Associated Charities at First Congregational Church last night. Justice Brewer was actively interested in the work of the Asso- | elated Charities, and was president of it at the time of his death. Most of the justices of the Supreme Court, a goodly company of senators and representatives, officials of the District government, heads of churches and persons prominent in every activity of the city were in attendance. The exercises were presided over by Heiuien Jennings, elected acting president after the death of Justice Brewer. He introduced ^is speakers Mr. Justice Henry B. Brown, retired; Mr. Justice Charles K. Hughes. Rev. Dr. Samuel II. Wood row, and former Commissioner llenrv B. F. Macfarland. Loss Sustained by Society. Rev. John Van Schaick, jr., offered the invocation. Mr. Jennings spoke of the loss sustained by the society in the death of Mr. Justice Brewer, and read the official minute adopted by the board. Mr. Jennings spoke also of the fact that the society had welcomed the opportunity afforded by certain recent criticisms to ask the Commissioners of the District of Columbia to appoint a special committee to examine and report upon the methods and accomplishments of the society. Mr. Justice Hughes said: "In Mr. Justice Brewer the man was greater than the judge. The severity of judicial labor and the routine of constant attention to the controversies as to the decision of which he had responsibility in no way dulled his enthusiasm or humanity." Referring to his duties as president of the Asspeiated Charities, Mr. Justice Hughes said: "He has left you what is better than a legacy of money. He has left you the priceless legacy of an inspiration which you must derive from the memory and association with a great man who was sincerely desirous to devote his life to the services of the country. "This meeting directs our attention to the importance of organized philanthropy. There may be some among us who look with misgivings upon the indications of the currents of thought, upon the movements which are taking place in our great democracy. No one who has had a chance to become intimately acquainted with the course of life in the cities that make up this country would fail to note the real world of effort which has such force and promise; no one who has had that vision can despair of democracy in America. Efforts Are Increasing. "But the effort in these days grows in intensity as it grows in intelligent direction, and as discouragements arise we tind a more skillful planning, a more thor>ugh organization, a more determined inLent to accomplish what may be possible by way of remedy. I am not speaking of those who contemplate a reconstruction of society. Rather do I refer to those who are deeply conscious of the extent of preventable misery and loss; those who want to see wholesome childhood; those who want to see protection against unnecessary injury; who desire to have barriers erected against the spread of d.sease; who wish decent houses, playgrounds, and in this way to bring a large number into that favored area where men, well nurtured, decently protected, and housed under conditions which permit of good work, may show what is in them. "That requires organization?most thor (jugn ana complete organization. .some decry it. But the waste of indiscriminate giving is so great, the faults that are remedied are so many, that we must have careful organization, and men are devoting themselves exclusively to that work with proper compensation. These are the exigencies of democracy. But there is such a thing as thinking too much of whether or not the man who gets something is altogether worthy of it. We must have back of all this organized effort th'e motive power of human love. Philanthropy and democracy must not exist in the dealing out of advantages by those who are prosperous to those who are looked upon with a pitying eye. Democratic Feeling Needed. "We must have that true democratic feeling, that honest appraisement of our fellow-men as men of like passions with ourselves and fewer opportunities, whom we like to relieve from distress because they are our brothers and we believe in eouauty. "And so it is that when we contemplate the life of one distinguished because of the exalted ottice wnich lie fined so acceptably?made great by reason of unselfish effort, made beautiful by a desire to help his fellow-men?we, in our own lives, approach a little, more closely to the ideal which we hold." "Brewer as a Jurist" was the subject chosen by -Mr. Justice Brown, lie had known the late justice front boyhood, was with hint at Yale University, had been with hint on Lite bench of the Supreme Court, ami told of many interesting i>oints in Justice Brewer's life, to which were added the touch of heartfelt friendship. Rev. Ur. Woodrow knew Justice Brewer as a member of bis church. "in honoring the memory of the man I feel a gieat loss." he said. "He is missing from his seat in this congregation. where for years he was a devout worshiper. Justice Brewer was deeply religious, although lie held not to the narrow things of religion, but to the fundamental principles. He was a man itf' tnlpr:inci? iiiuf t'tir t linvn rx-)in xvert* diametrically opposed to his belief lie had the greatest regard. Tribute From Pastor.

He could not understand why Christians prepared with large navies and armies should go forth and do precisely tne things which their religion taught them not to do." "The Associated Charities is the mutual friend of those who need help and those : who give help," Mr Maefarland said. "It ! gi ves accurate information from careful inquiry and records to the latter, so that they may give wisely and not hurtfully. It acts for them as the friend of the | needy, visiting, comforting, advising, encouraging, securing work or whatever else is needed. Food, fuel and other material aid is given when necessary j promptly, but in most cases it is a friend and not alms that is needed. Special activities are illustrated by the summer outings and encouragement of savings by the poor. Necessarily such a system requires many agents, some experts who give their whole time, hut most of them volunteers. Necessarily the large expense : is for the work of th.i friend and not the giving of alms. "Normally one kind of service should cost about as much as the other, and that is just the fact in this case. Tlie searching inquiry made by the committee of citizens headed by Justice Stafford last spring at the request of the District Commissioners shows, as that report said. tliat the financial system is aumirame anu accurate. carefully audited at regular intervals, and offers no opportunity for misappropriation or waste; that the working system is well planned and well administered; that due economy is observed; that the association has done and is lining a great and Indispensable work in this community, and is entitled to the heartiest support and confidence of all the citizens. Society's Valuable Work. "Words cannot, express the value of the Associated Charities to all of us. Its managers and agents, the former all unpaid, deserve the thanks as well as the assistance of all good citizens. "If you have any doubt about ibis ask for and read the copy of the report of the Stafford committee ami you will he satisfied." Committee reports showed that tlie society made a total of IVJ,-visits, gave employment to lt!!i persons permanently and to .'tOti temporarily, gave shoes and clothing to 1,007 school children, applicants passed upon for dispensary treatment. 1,701!; selected for outings, 1.20B; total sent to camps, 7*H.

AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON COMMISSIONERS Bill to Empower Board to Govern Public Utilities in District. A bill proposing to clothe the District Commissioners with the powers of a publie service, commission was introduced in the House yesterday by Chairman Smith of the District committee. Jn his annual message President Taft recommended the enactment of such a law. The measure gives to the proposed commission all the authority for coil I oiling rates and efficiency of service of railroad, street railroad, telegraph, telephone, gas and electric light" corporations, that is usually granted to such bodies. It provides that the commission shall exercise in the District all the powers now vested by law in the interstate commerce commission, although the orders, rules and regulations of the latter are to remain in force until changed ivy the new commission. Increase of Capital Stock. No public service corporation doing business in the District would be permitted to increase its capital sto-^k or issue bonds without lirst obtaining tho approval of the commission. Chairman Smith also introduced a hill provid.ng for an additiuna! method for enforcing and foreclosing tax sales and tax deeds in the District of Columbia. In a measure introduced hy Representative Bartholdt, the sum of $]i>i,ouo is appropriated for the purchase of the entire Oldroyd collection of Lincoln relics and for the acquisition of the properties at .">14 and ">18 10th street northwest, which adjoin the government property known as the house where President Lincoln died. The oill directs tlie grounds to be parked and the house in which the relics arc stored to be made tireproof. Representative Grant, by request, introduced a bill authorizing the extension of Benton street from Tunlaw road to 37th street northwest. George Dixon, sixty years old. died near Halltown. W. Va., Monday after a prolonged illness. ? ? || 

AMUSEMENTS || ? ? Belasco. The production of a new play by Mr. Preston Gibson presents several distinct aspects, each entitled to respectful interest. It may be regarded as a sporting event, for Mr. Gibson lias gone in for plays with as much enthusiasm as a turfman shows in acquiring and backing a string of horses. Ideas are his coursers, the theater is his race track, and instead of lingering in the background as an angel he goes to the front with the courage of a gentleman jockey, and is always up and ready for tlic next race. "Drifting" is the latest addition to liis string, which includes "The Turning Point," "The Vacuum" and "Derelicts." The production may be looked upon as a philanthropic enterprise, for, like the gentle hero of Leigh Hunt's poem, Mr. Gibson deserves, to be- written down as one who loves his fcllowmen. He has been to the greatest pains to provide amusement for mankind with little apparent motive than a generous desire for that appause which signifies approval and gratification. He evidenty esteems effort for the effort's sake. Ills circumstances a.e well known to be such as would prevtnt a suspicion of mercenary purpose and his methods are .on industrious and sincere to permit his work to be dismissed as a manifestation of idle vanity. _ As a social occasion there is no questioning the importance of a Preston Gibson ti.st night. I As a dramatic presentation "Drifting" has qualities of substantial merit which [compel interest apart from all other conI siderations. In structure the play has | good proportions,- reserving its "big scene" for the time when it will count for most and maintaining an atmosphere of vi ritv in its delineation of social types and their surroundings, which at times Is worthy of the late Clyde Fitch. It s eviueutly Mr. Gibson's intention to occupy the field which Clyde Fitcn made his own and which is at present but scantily cultivated. So long as he add.esses himself consistently to this purpose his work commands thoughtful at[ tention. It is only when some time-non| ored jest or some current allusion is presented with a kindly intention to he! liberal in comedy that a jarring note occurs. A very serious thought is introduced, whose scientific gravity is scarcely in key with the picture in light tints which the play offers. Race suicide is discussed, hut it is brought forward so abruptly that the auditor is made to feel almost like an intruder in discussions cf the most confidential domesticity. Yet the author must he given credit for having avoided morbid or crass suggest.on. The third act brings up a thoroughly enjoyable scene between the eloping wife, the reluctant lover and the big-minded husband. Let the reminiscence fiend point his relentless finger as he may (it is the time-honored function of criticism to d scover reminiscences), the scene is one of srr.iehtlv charm that even the hroad stroke of melodrama gratuitously introduced cannot destroy. An exceptional cast has been assembled for the portrayal. Walter Hale's quiet force gives substance and foundation to the story of frivolity and temptation. Janet Sothern as the adventuress gives a clean cut and discreet performance. Frank Goldsmith was an entertaining figure in the role of a sort of dilettante villain, who. having bagged his quarry, is profoundly puzzled about what to do with it. A role of central importance is that of the young wife, who drifts with the tide of cocktails and champagne among cigarette mists to the verge of scandal's whirlpool, whence she is rescued by the strong arm of her husband. This part is assumed by Miss Edith Luckett, who brought to it a wealth of girlish and sympathetic charm. It has scenes of emotionality which might tax the powers of a veteran actress. A particularly graceful touch was lent by Miss I-uckett in a scene at the piano, in which the villain's advances are met by little phrases from a popular song. The company for the most part shows unusual capability in depicting those most dimcult of stage types, well dressed and educated human beings. Even the little part of the maid was played by Miss Grace Morrissey in a way that made it a flash of real humanity. Mr. Gibson was called to the stage after the second act and bowed his acknowledgment of the applause. Flowers passed oyer the footlights vied in fragrance and beauty with those which an unusually liberal stage management had used in adornment of the scene. Notables from official, diplomatic and resident society made up the major portion of the audience. Hooking the house it ciicrcrnctoti a prnnd nnpra nicht.

"The House Next Door" was given as appreciative a reception last evening at the National Theater as when it appeared here last season. That finished actor, J. E. Dodson, repeated his artistic delineation of the aristocratic Sir John Cots wold. Bart. Except in a few instances tlie company remains unchanged. The play is from the pen of J. Hartley Manners, and is in his best comedy vein. It is an exceedingly well done bit of dramatic workmanship, and a thoroughly entertaining portrayal of a theme somewhat out of the ordinary. Were it intrusted to the hands of a less capable company its success might be questionable. But a* i-s. t,lp subtlety of its ones and situations is preserved without sacrifice of clearness and force. isir John t'otswold, an English baronet, is unwaverig in his social prejudices, and especially bitter towards ids next-door neighbor" Sir Isaac Jacobson, M. P. To make matters worse. Sir John is in that unenviable position of being an aristocrat run down at the heels, while Sir Isaac is rolling in wealth. J ore than that, his two children fall in love with the children of the despised occupant of the house next door. Kventuuliy, of course, the old English nobleman capitulates. Indeed, he even humbles hints. If to the sterling worth of his cnoe hated neighbor. But it takes the entire three acts of the play to accomplish tnis, and the dove of peace does not spread its wings untii the final drop of the curtain. In ids lines of pathes and in those of subtle comedy Mr. Uodsoi^_xvas thoroughly master of the situation. He made of Sir John a human, likable old fellow, despite his idiosyncracies of pride and prejudice. An artist always, the laylngin and draftsmanship of his canvas were never apparent. Miss Lorena Atwood. as Lady Jacobsen, and Miss Ruth Chester, as Lady Cotswold. were unusually capable in their rendition of these by no means easy roles, while the remainder, of the cast was well balanced and competent. Columbia. "God made us all to be happy, but some of us don't always know how to go about it," was the way "Aunt Mary" epitomized the story of her own "rejuvenation" in the last line at the Columbia last night. May Robson and her capable company have told.the same story to Washington theatergoers before, but the "Rejuvenat'on of Aunt Mary" seems to lose none of its humor by retelling. When the iU:iain aesceiiued lor too mst time last night there wrre few in tlie audience who had not thrown reserve to the winds and joined in the laughter called forth by the opinionated little lady who was "a great believer in not postponing things too long." even when it came to a trip to the big city after twenty-five years in the country. Miss Robson, as usual, left nothing to he desired in her internretation of the role she created several years ago. As the sweetly inconsistent old maid who would have been cold and hard-neai tea if people had left her alone and not been continually touching her heart and her pocketbook Miss Robson was everybody's "Aunt Mary" from the start. Of course, there was pathos sprinkled in. Rut how can an audience be long impressed with the pathetic story of a rosy-faced spinster who interrupts her own story with a disgusted "What kind of hair oil are you using?" addressed to her nephew, whom she has been fondling during the story. As Betty Burnett, who was in love with Aunt Mary's nephew, Jack Denham, Faye Cusick was just the wisely demure little girl to win her way to the heart of such a one as Aunt Mary. Jack Storey, as Jack Watkins, who couldn't keep out of trouble, but who was improving because. whereas he had twice before been evnelled from college, tbi?> time he wa? only suspended, was convincing. Paul Lecker, who has played in the piece as long as Miss Robson, was the same refreshingly "fresh" Mitchell, inventing and exnla'ninv the same measles in the same inimitable way. The rest of the I- st wv-s end. The performance of "The Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary" at the Columbia Theater last night was attended by members of the Phil Sheridan Woman's Auxiliary Relief Corps in a body. The performance was a benefit, under the auspices of the corps, for t lie relief of needy Union veterans In the District. A substantial sum was turned over to Mrs. Annie W. Johnson, chairman of the corps' committee on arrangements, by the company's manager. Chase's. Signor Trovato and Maclyn Arbuckle divide the premier honors at Chase's this week, one playing on violin strings and the other on heart strings. With his violin between his knees, Signor Trovato produces the richest strains of crpanil nnar-i ?Iia Aoi n* ?** '? vj/vi u, inu onccicot oil o ua lighter opera, the swinging tunes that provide whistling material and humming possibilities; and also the musical notes of the feathered inhabitants of the woods and of the old pump that has to be primed?all with an easy execution that made the demand for more unusually insistent. With "The Welcher," by Robert H. Davis, as his instrument. Maclyn Arbuckle portrays Dan Gassawav as a "dead game sport"?in the broadest meaning of that term. Fresh from a "killing' at the race track, he is to uphold the honor of his family?composed of himself?in entertaining a niece he has never seen at a "butlered" dinner in her honor. Long separation from the niece's mother prevents him from knowing anything about his relatives, but the bottle of champagne under the table and the profusion of iJowers, sil.verware and glasses on the table give an inkling of what he expects. As Uncle Dan prepares to put up the best front possible, the guest is announced, and in walks?to be faithful in description ?a forlorn waif from "poverty row." Instead of going from cocktail to coffee. Uncle Dan proceeds fro^n his richly appointed apartments to the "two rooms and a sink." where lies the niece's mother coughing all night and crying all day. Mr. Arbuckle is ably assisted by Vaughan Trevor and Miss Agnes Redmond. Clifford Walker, the English comedian, won approval by his presentation of the "after dinner" features of an English banquet. With a pair of blackrimmed spectacles and a monocle as his only aids in make-up. he cleverly portrayed live distinct types of those "we have with us' tonight." The Robert De Mont trio opened the bill with some good tumbling. The dancing of Gladys Clark and Henry Bergman won them applause. Berzac's Comedy Circus, Richards In some feminine dancing and "The Actors' Fund Field Day," shown by motion pictures, were other incidents. Academy. Those wiio like action to the fullest extent were well rewarded last night, when the New Academy presented to a capacity house a new sensational melodrama in four acts, by Walter Howard, "The House With the Green Shutters." The play shows a chain of exciting and astonishing pictures of criminal life in a great city, in which all sorts of devices and schemes are used in combating the skill of detectives. The story deals with Rodger Craven, a banker, who purpos?s to leave his fortune to the two children of his brother, whom he is unable to tind. Alter the misfortune of having his safe robbed. Craven is successful in finding the heirs through his efforts in trying to track down the thieves. But they are spirited away again to the house with the green shutters, whence it takes all the courage of the hero and the skill of the detectives to rescue them. Evelyn Faber as Alice Craven made an attractive heroine, while Arthur Devoe as Oliver Harrison won the approval of the largo audience as the hero. Ralph MacDonald as "Hungry Joe," and L3,r,da Karle as Janette Boynton were excellent. As the two tramp detectives Clarke Rose and John C. Mickey contributed comedy. J. W. Carroll appeared as Rodger Craven, the banker, and Rene Grau as Dick Craven. Lyceum. The attraction at the New Dyccum this week. "The Merry Maidens Company." has two one-act musical farces, the first entitled "Furnished Rooms" and the second. "All Aboard." There was no olio, but during the last act a series of clever imitations were introduced, in which the entire company figured. The show was written arid staged by Sam Rice, who, as the chief funmaker. proved clever and witty, and especially as Jules Levy in the last burletta. Miss Lilla Brennan took the leading feminine part and won approval with her songs and dances. Tom Tierney, Harry Keeler. Gertrude Thompson, J. Harrison Wolfe, Ruth Everett and - hi?41. well received in 1A)UI8 wuiiu ?t ? ~ -- - their respective roles. Gayety. The "Rollicking Girlies," at tlie Gayety Theater this week, present a burlesque show that is. In music, comedy and scenery, exceptionally pleasing. The performance is in two acts, and introduces catchy songs and plenty of good, clean fun. tfhe chorus is well trained and handsomely dressed. Fred Russell and Tom Robinson, as the "Fright Brothers," a couple of escaped convicts trying "to elude a female detective, kept the house in an uproar all through the play. Jdorva Williams, a drummer, carried "off first honors in the feminine contingent of the company. She was ably seconded bv Fvoretta Moore, who pleased In a song entitled "Sleepy Head." Miss Audrey Lang made good with Andrew Mack's "Mistah Moon." Jimmy Conors pleased with his parodies. An added attraction was a four-round boxing match between Don and Young Shirer, who appear under the management of their father. Robert Shirer. Casino. Capacity houses greeted the excellent vaudeville presented at the Casino Theater yesterday. The chief attraction was "The Balloon Girl." who began her act with an aeronan. | Your Clhoice off 1 I 7211=74 3Parlk | _?_ X ? X ^' ' '" ^ ' :^v-; - : | Take UUtlhi st. or Br IH. R.

The house was then dark- * ened and the girl, still singing, sailed ^ over the audience in an immense bal- ^ loon. i The Musical Macks, with various 1, musical instruments, ranging from a 3 violin to a bass horn, were very en- ^ tertaining. The Tod Nards gave a < good exhibition of acrobatic feats. El J Gordo, magician, was very pleasing ^ witli his funny tricks. Some clever ^ dancing was shown by Myers and ; Tomsel. Ask and Oarr, in a singing and dancing act, were well received i, and several good reels of motion pic- ^ tures were shown. ^ Cosmos. Robert McDonald and Company in "A ^ Friend in Need" have perhaps one of the prettiest comedy dramas on the 3 vaudevile stage. The story is of a gal- ^ lant 'burglar of the Raffle^ type, who ? mingles thieving with sentiment and 1 gi ves excellent advice while he despoils | 3 his victims, and who averts a tragi dy by | a little piece of diplomacy that the audi- ^ ence found delightful. Woodford's Mid- ' get Animal Circus made a big hit with S the little ones and their friends. Bolduc ; and Roy, present a very acceptable mu- ; sieal act on many instruments. In Springer and Church's farce, "Who Is ; It?" the fun centers on a wax dummy. J Frankie Fafrell. with songs, and Lilly ] Langdon, comedienne, completed a bill ^ that is one of the strongest of the Cos- f mos Reason. The entire bill will be .changed Thursday, with the exception of the main feature, the burglar play. Avenue Grand. A good bill was presented at the Avenue Grand Theater yesterday, which was greeted by a large audience. Sam Thornberg and Company's comedy sketch entitled "A Jealous Husband" proved to be the feature of the show. Dale and Dale, comedy singers and dancers, completed their act in good style. Dunbar's goat circus was amusing. The animate perform clever tricks. Boyd and Lorentz made good both as singers and dancers. The motion pictures were of exceptional interest. jj Majestic. The Majestic Theater presented four ^ well selected acts yesterday before sev- ^ eral large audiences, the feature of the 3 show being the Five Musical Lovelands in jj a high-class musical act, which was well ^ received. The Three Clares, comedy aero- 3 bats, perform clever tricks, Lem Welch j in dialect impersonations received his a share of appHause, and Marion Kay, sing- J ing and ta'king comedienne, met with ap- j proval. Motion pictures conclude the va- f, ried and attractive bill. , f,
