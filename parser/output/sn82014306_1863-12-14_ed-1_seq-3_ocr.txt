At a meeting of the Democratic Central Committee of Marion county, held at the Senti nel office, in Indianapolis on the 12th inst., for the purpose of apportioning delegates from the several township, according to the ratio of 39 delegates given Marion county by the Central Committee of the Sixth Congressional District. , After due deliberation the following apportion men t was agreed upon: Decatur Township 3 Frankltn " Pike M Perry " a Lawrence " 5 Wayne 3 W orr en ............................... 3 Waaoingtoe. 3 Centre 5 Total 39 Interest em the Indiana Funded State - Debt. T t-u Public: Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co. will pay, at their banking bouse, in the city of New 1 ork. the interest on tbe Indiana five and two and a-half per cent, stocks, which fell due on the first day ot July last, and that which will fall due on the first day of January next. The failure to pay the interest in July was not caused by the want of money. The money was In the State Treasury for that purpose, and still is; but the State Auditor and Treasurer refused to remit it to New York, alleging the absence of a technical appropriation. In June last I concluded an arrangement with Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co., for the payment of the July iuterest. Tbey notified the Agent of Slawin New York, John C. Walker, elected by the late Leisl stare, that they would pay the in terest, and to enable them to do so, requested a list of the stockholder, to be taken from the book of the agency. This be refused to fur nish. They then notified him that they .would fiay his checks issued to the stockholders for their merest in the manner in which the payments have always been m de, and exonerate him from all personal liability whatever. ' He refused to avail himself of the offer, and suffered tbe inter ' est to go unpaid. Thej could not safely go for ward and pay it In the absence of the required list. I have taken steps to prepare what is be lieved to be a correct list, from all sources, which , will be completed in a few days, when the pay ment of the July interest will be proceeded with at once. Notice of the day when payment commences will be given by Messrs Winslow, Lauier k Co. I have employed J. K. Oapeu, Esq., who waa clerk in the office ander the late State Agent, Col. Hudson, to assist them in making the pay ment. The State of Indiana has made ample provi sion for the payment of the interest oo all her stocks, and the money is in the treasury for that purpose, but is withheld as above stated; and this arrangement has therefore been made and the money advanced by Winslow, Lanier & Co., for the credit of the State.

Opposition to the Radicals. The Craw fordsville Review thus refers to a proposed meet ing of the Republicans in Montgomery county who are opposed to the radical element in their party: A number of conservative Republicans in this county, we are informed, propose holding a meeting at the Court House sometimes about the middle of the present month. The object is, we believe, to reorganize the party, divesting it en tirely from the influence of radical abolitionism and the control of the present corrupt leaders. Air. Oustavus Scott, with other prominent con servatives who have taken the matter in hand are undoubtedly equal to the task they hare undertaken. They are determined to follow no longer the guidance of Lincoln and bis base sat tellites, whose policy of nero emancipation and other radical - measures have destroyed the last remnant of Union feeling in the South, and well nigh extinguish the forlorn hope of the patriot for a durable and permanent restoration of the Union as the fathers made it. - Every genuine Republi can who revere the teachings of the immortal Washington, the warnings of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, in preference to the treason of beward, Chase, Lovejoy, Giddingn and the lesser ights of Abolitionism, will be called upon to join in this new movement.

Skplctio Shooting Elopement Aa- a est. We have the particulars of one of those cases of domestic infelicity and crime which have of late become so common. During the oast summer a cattle dealer named McCoy made the acquaintance of tbe family of James Reedus, re siding m (Jrange count, three miles from iivo nut. Keedus being absent at Memphis, McCoy succeeded in seducing bis wife. Reed as returned to find his home desolated; and, as was natural. and we believe lust, attempted the life of tbe se ducer of his wife. He shot McCov. but he soon recovered sufficiently from his wound to be able to get out. His first act after his recovery was to elope with the wife of Reedus, and the guilty pairpaasel through this city oo Monday last, and on Tuesday took passage on the Big Grey Eage tor some point down the river Gu Tuesday eveuirtg Reedus arrived in this city; but as a writ h id been issued for his arrest aud forwarded here. Deputy Sheriff Jones ar retted him on the .ferry boat as be was crossing over to Portland to confront the wretched wife and her paramour in sin. Reedu had upon his person several pistols, all heavily loaded. He also had $4,875 in Coufederate mouev. In View of the latter fact he was turned Aver to Mior Fry, commaodant of this post, and is now con fined in the military prison of this city. Reedus declared that be bad the pistols ex presfcly for the purpose of killing McCoy, and that he would follow bim. when rt.le.ised, "to the end of the earth but what he would kill tbe de stroyer of bis happiness." We have not learned bow he explains his pos session of tee Confederate monev. It is proba ble, however, that he bought it for the purpose of speculating with it at Memphis.

JTlr. Chaiae'a Itepetrt. In submitting to the consideration of Congress tV.e report of the state of finances, the Secretary of the Treasury baa much satisfaction in being able to say in general that tbe operations of tbe department have been attended, during the last fiscal year, by a greater measure of success than be ventured to anticipate in the beginning. Not. withstanding the aid afforded by the additional issue of United States notes under the joint reso lution of January, the Secretary had found it . a . ..a a. a a impossible to prevent me graaoat increase, our- ing the session of Congress, in amount ot unpaid I tequiaitiotis. . 1 boee woo were unsatisfied at tbe beginning of the session were indeed discharged, and large sums were applied to new demands for current disbursements remaining necessaiily un paid Increased steadily, notwithstanding all ef forts to prevent it, until it reached, at the close of the session, the sum of $72,171.159., The loan act, and the national banking act, were fol lowed by an immediate revival of public credit. Success quite beyond anticipation crowned tbe efforts ot the Secretary to distribute the 5-20 loan in all parts of the country, as well as every other measure adopted by him for replenishing the treasury. The result was, that within two months after the adjournment of Coocrees, the whole mass of suspended requisitions had been paid, all demands promptly met, and fall provis ion made for the pay of tbe army aud navy, Doriug the remainder of the fiscal year no em barrassment attended the administration of tbe finances except those which are inseparable from vast expenditures. Notwithstanding tbeso ex penditures, it is gratifying to be able to state that during the last year the total disbursements did not greatly exceed, while the . increase of the public debt did not equal, the estimates submit ted to Congress by the Secretary at its last ses sion. . Thus, while it was then estimated that the pub lic debt, on the 30th of June, lb'63, would reach the sum of $1,122)7.40?. its actual amount on that day waa $1.0ü3,7y3,I31. and while the dis bursements for the year were estimated at $693, 346,321. the real total was $714.709.995; while the receipts from other ordinary sources of reve nue thus clearly correspond with the estimates. and largely exceed them. The receiou from tbe internal revenue have alone disifppointed expectation. Experience has demonstrated iu error. The estimate waa $85, 456,303, while the actual receipts were $37,640, 789. A part of the deficiency may be attributed to the changes made in it by Congress after the estimate waa made; but it is not probable, as neither cause operated to reduce the receipts, that the revenue from this source would have exceed ed half the estimated amount. It is clear that the law, unless materially amended, will not pro duce the revenue expected from it. 1 he following is the becretary s estimate of receipts and expenditures for the next year: Kttiraated balance June 1st, lbb4, .$M5,t&b,- 539; from customs, $70,000.01)0; from internal revenue, $125.000.000; from lands. $1.000.000 from miscellaneous sources, $5,000,000, making the estimated aggregate receipts $206.833,539. He estimate the real expenditures for the year at $751,815,0, from which deduct the receipts from ordinary sources, as before stated, and it leaves to be provided by loan $544,978,549. The rum to be provided represents the increase of debt during the year. He assumes, therefore, fhe cor rectness of the estimate which put the lelt, br July 1st. 1664. at $1.656.936.641. It will result from these estimates that the whole debt will have reached, on the 30th of J Que, 1 65, the sum of $2,231,935,190. The Commissioners of Internal Revenue rec ommend n increase of the tax on bank note cir culation to two and two-fifths per cent.: an in crease on the duty of distilled spirits" to sixty cents per gallon; on tobacco to twenty rents per pound on leaf, and from five to ten cents (ac cording to quality,) on manufactured; ten cents per gallon ou crude petroleum. ; . The enactment of such laws will secure an in crease of the internal revenue to the amount originally estimated of $150,000,000 a year, re quired by the strongest considerations of public policy. Hitherto tbe expenses of the war have been dsfraved by loans, to an extent which nothing but toe expectation of its speedy termination could fully warrant. It will not escape observation that the average rate of interest is now increasing, aud it is obvt ous that it must coutinue to increase with the in crease of the proportion of the interest bearing to the non-interest bearing debt; and ss the amount of the latter, consisting of United States notes and fractional currency, can't be materially aug mented without evil consequences of the most serious character, the rate of interest must in crease with the debt and approach continually the highest average, that mint be greater or less in proportion to the duration and cost of the war. In a former report, the Secretary placed the limit to which the loan in the form of certificates of indebtedness could be carried, at $100,000,000 Experience has shown it can be carried to $150,- 000, and that its natural limit is about that sum. On first due, the amount of thee certificates was $145,720.000 It would he unsafe therefore to rely on any substantial increase of loan in that form. . d ' The amount precribvd by law to the issne of United Slates notes has been reached, ad the Secretary think it clearly inexpedient to increase the amount, buthuieut circulation having been already provided, the government must now bor row, like any other emplOTcr of capital tempo rarily lequiring more than the income will sup ply, and rely for the credit which will secure advantageous loans upon rood faith. Industrial activity has accumulated, though not immediately available, capital and Sitisfscto factory provisions for punctu-il payment of ac cruing interests aud ultimate reimbursement of the principal. The subscription for the remaining 5-20's and deposits for temporary loans, therefore, mus. be directed. All reasonable expectation of means for the service of the current year, except from negotiations under the act of laot session, the um seems to be looked for from the-e two sources have already been stated, and amount to $120, 059,600. If this aggregate be deducted from the amount to be provided by loans for the last seven months of the current year, already shown to be $Jb,l 6b 41-19, to be provided by negotiations un der tbe act of lat session, and under some like act must be provided in some like manner, if necessary, the sum of $544,578.543 estimated as likely to be required from loans for tbe fiscal year 1865. The act of last session authorized the loans supposed to be requited for the fiscal years of Itbd and lcb4, and ol the amount required for tbe service of these two years to the 1st of De cember, now current $150,000.000 in United States notes, and $50,000,000 bv a lorn for two years in fire per cent, treasury notes, have al ready been provided under that legislation. The act u so well conceived and expressed that little other legislation for the loans of 1864 and lbbo will be required than the application to those years of its leading provisions. . It will doubtless be thought expedient (his ses sion to authorise the borrowing in some form of $300,000,000 lor the current and $600,000,000 for the next fiscal tear, Indeed the only mod in cation of the act of last session of the current aud coming year seems t be just to ascertain from time to time the amounts destroyed and lost, and to replace them by new issues. 2d. The repeal of the existing limitation of the deposit loan to $100,000,000, aud the substitu tion of a provision for a reserve equal in amount to halt the pepoit. 3d. The permisxion of the negotiation of loans redeemable absolutely at pleasure or at pleasure after the time fixed, uoi more remote than forty years, and tho omission of tbe clause taxing the circulation of deposits, as beiug more appropriate to niT internal revenue bill. It is hoped tbe other provisions of the last may be retained in the new losu act. Under such legislation the Secretary entertains little doubt ol beiug able to obtain whatever funds will be needed through loans, at reasonable rales of in teret, for bonds or treasury notes. For a want of this confidence, however, he re lies much on the support to be given to the pub lic credit by tbe National Banking System and by the nationalization of the currency, there is. be thinks, no possibility of a permanently sue cessful administration of the finances nnder cir cumstances involving the creation of large debts, unless loans can be effected as a medium of gen eral and equal credit throughout the country and rot liable to variarion in quantity or in value. except under tbe operation, of national legisla tion and the general laws of trade. The Secretary asks the special attention of Congress to the proposition for a uniform rate of interest and the repeal of the section which con uects the issues of national currency in any de gree with State banks. The Secretary also rec commends a provision to be made by law for tbe deposit with national , banks and also with the Treasurer and lAssistanl Treasurer, at such rate of interest or for such periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe of money paid into or invested under the orders of judicial courts, it is not impossible that in this way many mil lions would be placed in the Treasury at moder ate rales of interest. The Secretary refers to Congress the question whether the duty on national currency and tbe deposits of national banking associations shall correspond with tbe duties, on other circulation and deposits. He thinks, for the present at least, some discrimination u favor of the national associations may be properly admitted, in consid- ; eration of the indispensable importance of a na tional currency, not adapted, like United states notes, to temporary emergencies, but permanent in its very nature and adequate to all demands of I nusinesa, and capable at no distant penoo or be ing made equal to and convertible into coin and therefore iu real representative and equivalent.

Mr. iiruoks said tbe üouse could elect a Speaker without the names of these gentlemen being struck on the rolls. Mr. Stereos protested against their admission, in order to facilitate the organization he would ithdraw his motion for the present and agian offer it when tbe Louisiana members .were to be sworuin. The credentials of the members from Virginia were read at the instance of Mr. Lorejoy and a resolueion was offered that their names be enter ed on the rolls. . . r Mr. J. C. Allen raised the point that the cre dentials were certified to merely by the County Clerk. He moved to lay the resolution on the table. The Clerk read the credentials, as he under stood they were iu accordance with the laws of Virginia. A brief conversation ensured as to the legality ol tne credentials, when the question was taken and the resolution ngieed to, and the uames of the members from v irginia were entered on the rolls.

It was stated there on authority of scouts and messengers that much of Longstreef a artilleiy and train had fallen into the hands q ourjpnrsu ing force, bat this lacked tonfirmation. . The re gion in which pursuit is made is so far distant from the telegraph aa to make it difficult to veri fy auch statements. General Butler and a number of the Sanitary Commission, now at Fortress Monroe, hare tel graphed to the Government here that the rebel authorities have stopped the distribution of sup plies sent to the Union prisoners in their hands. We are notified that up to this time no infor mation bad reached Washington indicating that anything like an official rebel notice had been communicated to either General Butler or Gen.

A New Orleans cor respondent of the Traveller writes: The expedition of Gen. Banks to Texas is a glorious success. The Union men are rallying nnder the standard of Gen. Banks in large num bers. All the Texans required was a force to back them np, and they have repeatedly said that if a sufficient army was sent to support them they would soon have Texas all right again. They have already proved the truth of their statement, for Banks has recruited two regiments since he reached the State, and the work is still going ahead. The Maiden Bank waa entered shortly before noon to-day. A son or tbe f resident was tbe only person in the bank at the time, and be was murdered. The Bank was robbed of about all its contents.

At no period in the history of the nation hai It been mora important that the people ahould be edviaed of the principles upon which our Government ta based and the bearing of passing events apon our polical Intlitutiona. We are In the midst of a revolution, and the effort la be ing made to overthrew the Government eatablUhed by the wisdom, sagacity and patriotism of Washington, Jefferson, Madiaon and their asaoc-tea, aad establWh In Its etead a atrong, overshadowing and centralised des potlsm. State rights, which have protected the liberty of the citixen, are to be struck down; Stale lines are to be obliterated and the Federal Government ia te wsarp the control and direction of th domettk fpolicy and Insti tutions of the States. This is the policy of the Adminis tration party. Ita leading members boldly proclaim it, and the events which have transpired lince the advent of the present Administration into power clearly fore abadow that such ia its purpose. Such ia tbe issue presented to the American people, ti is for them to illustrate the capacity of man fur self government, by insisting on a government of the people, just as our forefathers did, in opposition te an aristo sralie, arbitrary and kingly power. So loag have we pros pered and enjoyed the blessings of civil and religloua freedom, that we fail to appreciate their value and have almost forgotten the sacrifices by which they were achieved. Tower is ever stealing from tbe many to the few, and unless the people boldly and manfully meet the present crisis ere long the government of tbe many will become the government of the few, and Instead of being the asylum for the oppressed sf all nations, our own will become as oppressive with its ordrr and burdens aa the most despotic The Sknttkel will continue to advocate old fashioned Democratic doctrine, believing firmly that tbe only hope of preserving Republican Inttitutiona rests on their su premacy in tbe administration of tbe government. These doctrines are clearly and comprehensively set forth in the following platform prepared by Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic party : Equal an 1 exact Justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion religioua or political ; - Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all na tions, entangling alliance wiih none ; The support of the State Governments ta afl their rights, as the moot competent administration for cor do mestic concern and tbe surest bulwarks against an Ü -republican tendencies. . Tbe preservation of the general government in its whole conttif ttlonal vigor, aa the (beet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad ; A jealous care of the riht of election by the people ; A mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution, where peaceful remedies are unprovMea. Absolnte acquiescence In the will of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which there ia no appeal but to force tbe vital principle and immediate parent of despotuim ; A well disciplined militia, our best reliance ta peace, and for the first moments tf war, till regulär may re lieve them. The supremacy of the civil over the military author ity. Economy In the public expenses, that laber may be lightly burdened; The honest payments of our debts, end sacred preser vation of tbe public faith; Encouragement of agriculture, and of commerce as tts handmaid. lhe diffusion of Information, and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of public reason; Freedom of religion;
