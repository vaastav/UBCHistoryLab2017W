The act also con tains other provisions beneficial to the administration of territorial affairs. There is a lack of proper facilities for passenger travel between Hawaii and tho mainland, due in part to the fact that the through steamers mak ing Honolulu a port of call are gen erally in foreign ownership and can not under the navigation laws trans port passengers between the Territory and the mainland. Relief should be accorded through the suspension of the navigation laws for a limited pe riod so far as they relate to such tra vel, or In some other way which will add to tho opportunities for transpor tation of passengers. Appropriations aro needed for continuing the work upon Honolulu, Hllo and Kahulul liar-, bors, for beginning work on somo har. bor on the island of Kauai, and for the public buildings heretofore authorized, at Honolulu and Hilo. The Territory consists of eight prin cipal Islands having an agregate area of 6,640 square miles. Besides the general ten years' census there were made during the last fiscal year the five-year labor investigation required by law, and at the same time and un der tho same direction a military cen. sus of the- Territory and a social cen sus of the city of Honolulu. The re sults of these are not yet available, except the figures for the entire po pulation by races founded upon a pre. limlnary count, which is subject to correction. The population of the Territory thus found is 191,905, an increase of 16,905 over the previous year. Tne population by races is as follows: Hawalians, 26,108; part Ha wallans, 11,912; Chinese, 21,666; Jap anese, 79,520; Portuguese, 22,701; Spaniards, 2,031; Porto Ricans, 4,896; WORK OF THE HAWAII EXPERIMENT STATI In the section on relations with agri cultural experiment stations, in the report of the Secretary of Agriculture for 1910, the following appears: Great Interest has been aroused in Hawaii by the cotton experiments in augurated by the station, and tho growing of cotton in commercial quan tities appears to be assured. The cotton plant requires less water than sugar cane, and already over 500 acres of cotton have been planted on sugar plantations where irrigation water was deficient. Sea Island and Caravonica varieties are the chief ones used, and their cultivation as perennials is in tended. By pruning at the proper season the time of picking can be made to articulate very well with the cane-grlndlng season, when there is the greatest demand for labor on the plantations. The adaptability of this crop to tho owner of a small tract of i ' flH AFRAID Hfc'uV blacks and mulattocs, 625, Caucasians, 14,409; and all others consist largely of Koreans and Filipinos, 8,037. The population of Honolulu Is estimated to bo about 50,000. During the last fiscal year settlers and tourists from the mainland have come In in increas ed numbers, and 1,790 Russians and 868 Portuguese Immigrants were intro duced by the bureau of Immigration and 2,651 Filipinos by the sugar plant, ers. Imports and exports for the year aggregated $75,024,059, an increase of $9,687,175 over the preceding year. Tho Imports were $25,138,247, an in crease of $3,713,267, and the' exports $46,480,412, an Increase of $5,964,908. The Imports and exports for the flrBt year of the territorial government were $30,880,478, tho inward tonnage for the year was 1,308,801 tons, an increase of 149,683 tons, and the out going tonnage was nearly as much. Tho receipts which go Into the federal treasury wcro $l,57o,319.15, an in crease of $17,939.25. The federal In ternal revenuo receipts were $209,- 132.51, an Increase of $130,024.52, of which $124,201.18 was the corpora tion tax. The assessed value of the property was $150,208,467, an increase of $11,357,647 for the year. At the close of the year bank deposits amounted to $13,324,305.54, an in crease of $3,666,486.33. Current receipts for the year were $3,641,245.35, an increase of $589,718 54 over the previous year. Disburse ments, including payments to coun ties, were $3,264,364.20, In increase of $329,380.10. The receipts exceeded the disbursements by $260,388.04. Thb not cash balance at the close of the year after deducting all outstanding warrants was $698,970.96. Bonds bear ing 4 per cent interest wero paid to the amount of $80,000, and public im provement 3 1-2 per cent bonds were issued to the amount of $200,000. The bonded Indebtedness of the Territory at the close of tho fiscal year was $4,079,000, which is 2.71 per cent of the aggregate assessed value of the property of the Territory. land is being demonstrated. Breeding experiments with cotton are being con tinued, and by vegetative propagation some desirable strains are being rapid ly developed, without the possibility of undesirable crosses through polli nation. The investigations on rice havo resulted in some new varieties that exceed any in common use. They have also shown the value of ammo nium sulphate as a fertilizer for tho rice crop. The visit of tho agrono mist to. Japan last season resulted in the introduction of a number of newly developed varieties of rice, some of which appear very promising. Tho pineapple soil studies have been con tinued, and it has been found that where the manganese content is not too high the uso of suitable fertilizers will correct the injury duo to manga nese. A more serious pineapple trou ble in Hawaii has been found, duo to ON a lack of aeration of the soil, and stu dies to correct this condition are in progress. A study of tho pineapple fruit has shown tho influence of ripe ness on tho sugar content. There ap pears to be no increase in the amount of sugar In a fruit after it is cut, al though tho fruit will become yellow and soft, honco tho Importance of the stage of maturity on tho quality of tho fruit. The rubber-tapping experiments have been continued, and the profit ableness of growing Ceara rubber has been shown. In connection with the rubber investigations it has been found possible to keep down all weed growth by spraying between tho trees with arsenlto of soda. A demonstra tion on 400 acres showed tho success of the treatment at tho low cost of $1.25 per acre. i HIS BEEN HERE Willis Van Devanter, tho new asso the United States, was a visitor in Hawaii about tw'elvo years ago, when he visited the volcano. As assistant attorney general in tho Interior de partment, some years ago, ho was the official who gave the most assistance to J. G. Pratt, when the latter went to Washington and secured an appro priation of a million dollars for the Chinatown fire claims. But for the efforts of Van Devanter, Hawaii would probably not have got the appropria tion, qiw Van Devanter is a personal friend of District Attorney Breckons, as well as i- of Postmaster Pratt and Ed Towso of Honolulu, and Breckons cabled his congratulations yesterday. Flvo or six years ago Breckons mado the pre diction, to local friends, that Van De vanter would eventually reach the su preme bench, and he was elated yes terday when news of the nomination came. "When I go to Washington next," said Breckons, "I want to be admitted to practice in the United States Supreme Court. I want to have my old law professor, who first admitted mo to practice, move my admission, and Associate Justice Van Devanter swear me In." TRY LIHUE, December 10.

The enly thing that saved it was the fact that it was built on ground a few feet higher than the rest of the land, and so missed the full effect of tho current As it was, the lower story of the mill, including most of tho ma chinery, was submerged by the flood, which rose at this point to a depth of thirty or thirty-flvo feet above the ordinary level of the river. Several large flumes were carried away, Including a high truss flumo carrying tho water of tho main ditch across tho river, besides two or three m JUST CE II u Mi S RMI PEARY REWARD URGEDJY TAFT (From the President's Message.) The complete success of our coun try in Arctic exploration should not remain unnoticed. Tho unparalleled achievement of Peary In reaching tho North Pole, April 6, 1909, approved by critical examination of the most ex pert scientists, has added to the dis tinction of our navy, to which he be longs, and reflects credit upon his country. His unique success has re ceived generous acknowledgment from scientific bodies and Institutions of learning In Europe and America. I recommend fitting recognition by Con. gress of the great achievement of Robert Edwin Peary. 

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOC smaller ones crossing the rlco patches. About three thousand dollars worth of rice was loBt, In addition to tho other damage, and tho losses will mount up to over $5000 altogether. As tho company Is not a very wealthy organization, it will probably make an effort to get a reduction of the rent which must pay for tho crop this year, tho whole tract being leased from tho Bishop Estate. Tho Koloa pumping plant, at Ma haulcpu, was burled with debrlB washed down from the mountain-side during the recent rainstorm. Being lii the bottom of a pit, there was no opportunity to divert tho water from it, and the dirt and rubbish from tho hills soon covered it entirely. A gang was Immediately put to work at clear lng it out, and tho last of the rubbish was entirely removed the first part of this week. Garden Island. BY AUTHORITY SEALED TENDER8.
