The last annual message of Presi dent Hayes contains but few augges tions or recommendations that can be deemed of general interest. In deed, it may be said, that even the well-informed public have come to regard these voluminous State pt pers as things more curious than useful, and there are but few who have the abundant leisure to indulge in such an extravagant outlay of time as is required to read and inwardly digest such a vast array of facts, fig ures and propositions, to say noth ing of the con cieusness of utter ig norance which nearly all will confess in matters of statecraft. Mr. Hayes indulges his prejudices by abuse of the South, and alleges that privileges conferred by the Con stitutiý,nal Amendments are denied her newly enfranchised citizens. Reform in the Civil Service is stren uonsly urged, and the "Spoilse Sys-. tem" is strongly condemned.. The . Mormons come in for a share of his good offices, end the suppression of their polygamie practices he insists should be promptly enforced by the exercise of the Federal authority. I The financial condition of the country and of the government are shown to be very satisfactory, and the gradual reduction of the Public Debt is made to exhibit the extraor dinary receperative capacity of the country. ' He commends the great services s General Grant has rendered to the Union, and suggests that the office ' of Captain General be created for him, "witH suitable provisions roea- - ting to compensation, retirement, 1 etc.," which would in his judgment 'be altogether fitting and:proper, end would be warmly approved by the country." The accumulation of business in 1 the United States Courts has made it s necessity that there should be as increase is the number of Ci euit Judges, which he recommends should he done at once. National aid he thinks should be extended towards the education of the masses, and the public school system of the States rendered more eflcient by increase of the school fua4 from the sale of public lands. -OLD "Santa Clans" has again selected Ferguson a Schnack's as his Headquarters. New Mechanical Toys and Holiday Goods in profusion. The United States Supreme Court. Several of the Justices of the Uni States Supreme Court, will shortly retire, on account of advanced age, t and having served the time upon the d Bench which entitles them to a full pension. Judges Swayne and Strong some time since, signified their in tention of resigning, and Judge Clit ford has been rendered ud~lt for fur ther service by a stroke of paralysis. f and' mst soon withdraw. Judge! Hunt has also been a victim r of paralysis, and Judge Brad ley, covets the. seclusion of pri. i. vate life, and derives no comfort from n his uneviable fame as a member of n the Electoral Commission. The e youngest member of the Court is ý. Judge Harlan, who is now forty-sev ,h en years of age. The last Southern representative in the Court was John A. (amnhll who raeigfned at the outbreak of the war. The responst bility in filling the vacancies will no doubt be left to the incoming admin istration. Will Mr. Garfield pur'sue a step farther the conservative poli cy adopted by Mr. Hayes, in the ap pointment of a Southern man to a place in the Cabinet, Agd give us one member of the SupreME Court? --Tur most appropriate Christ mas present for your wife is a White or Wheeler a Wilson Sewing Ma chine, and Ferguson a Schnack sell them. --Tuz improvement in the weath er, recently, has brought with it a corresponding improvement in busi ness and the popular and enterpris ing firm of Baer i Mann, A.
