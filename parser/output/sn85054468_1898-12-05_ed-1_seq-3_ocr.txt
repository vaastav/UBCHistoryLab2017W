On th'e'cve of the. conv enlnsr of Consrcss Lrifcht lights gleamed from, the White House windows last night and sparkled among the raindrops and pools anions the dark grasses -and .foliage In Executive Park. Inside the,,mansIon there as u blaze of light and the Executive clerks and messengers were all a-bustlc, nhi'e an important conference was held in one of the retiring rooms on the lower floor. To the "White Houso attendants- this conference was but "the usual Sunday cenlng social function," but to close ob servers of current events It was a signifi cant gathering. The conferees were the President, Sen ator Hark Hanna, Gen. Shatter, Adjt. Gen Corbin, Comptroller of the Currency Banes and Surgeon General Sternberg. It is unnecessary to observe that Gen Miles was not present. Printed copies of the President's mes sage to Congress had been received from the -Government Printing Otllcc and were read and discussed bv the guests Wheth er anj elimination!, revisions or additions were made to the document is not known. Gen. Shaffer was not as rotund and jolly as he was on the occasion of his last visit to the Executive Mansion. He has lost considerable flesh since his peaceful but painful experiences at Santiago, and wore the morose express'on of face so notice-1 able among campaigners who participated in the war in the tropics. He was not attired in the uniform of his rank, but wwre a dark civilian suit and a sJlk hat. After emerging from the White House with Gen, Corbin he stated that his -visit was onij a social call on the President. Senator Hanna lingered until long after the other conferees had departed, ?nd talked earneetlv with Sir. JIcKiniej about coming events, which are alreadj casting their shadows before. While-1-e was at the Executive Mansion the significant statement was made that the forthcoming Executive civil service order would make 

S.OOO exemptions from the classified service. These will include, it is said, all the departmental meson gersand watchmen, the pension office fcurgeons, "examiners and special agents and rainy" other positions in the revenue, customs and postal service. The orders "lias been readv for publica tion several dajs. but it is being carefully gon over and revised from time to time and may not be given to the press until Wednesdav . A friend of the President stated last night that his message to Congress will be "the mot remarkable state document since the davs of Abraham Lincoln's war-time Administration,'" It. will be voluminous and an historical review of recent events, witli comments, sugges tions and recommendations. Its leading feature willbe the war with Spain and the circumstances attending it. It--wa also stated that the President will not attempt to la down anj fixed line of policj for the permanent govern ment iof the Philippines, Porto Rico and Cuba. That matter Is left entirely to Congress, with the recommendation that careful consideration be given to the colonial-jw.Ho, which must, he says, be somewhat In the nature of an experi ment. He will urge that the regular arm) be Increased at once to lOO.OuO men, as rec ommended by St-cretarj Alger, Gen. Miles and Adjt. Gen. Corbin In their annual re ports, The President will alo reiterate and urge Secretarj long's recommendations for the Increase of the navy in order that our expanding commerce and new posses sions may be adequatel) protected. A chapter of the message will be devoted to the work of the Alger Relief Commis sion Mr. McKln'ey will aure Congress that Its investigations will be thorough, and that if an) persons are found blame worthy the) will be punished, also that if errors are found in the mllltarj jstem they will be corrected. This chapter of the message was the mot Interesting theme discussed at the conference last n'ght, as It was of per sonal Interest to at least three of the con feree. The President does not favor the repeal of the war taxes at present, owing to im mediate and prospective heav) demands upon the Treasury. Another feature of the message will be i detailed statement of the expenditures of the 150,000,(00 national defense fund Mr. McKinley will also strongly recom mend that immdlate steps be taken for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, which he has treated as "a national necessity." The President expects to hear reassur ing advices from the Peace Commission after its session at Paris today. He does not fear a hitch in the negotiations over the acquirement of certain Islands for coaling and cable stations, and believes the work of the Commission w ill be ended before Saturday. The opinion seems to be gaining ground at the White House that .Hon. Joseph 11. Choate will be appointed am bassador to England, "unless Senator Hanna has a dark horse candidate for the place." EnKlcr and Mlc-e. (From the Concord Monitor.) Dots an one suppose that a nation which rose In its mhrht to free Cuba from oppre-ion, which calmly awaited official investigation of the Mow ing tip of the Maine, will suddenl degenerate liecausf of the possesion of a few islands in the 1'aclncf Does anyone really believe that because we have transferred tlie sovereign!) of the Philip pines from Spain to ourselves we are suddenly to be transformed frtm a humane and con-ervative people into a nation of oppressors and wild im perialists Nothing in ou- hutorj justifies this view.

HADDAWAY, S Mill St. MOHICAHS tT?EB.Y JITJCHjAT.TVE. Tribesmen of Uncajt Wojtt Con necticut Real Estate. New liaven, Dec. 4. It has been popu larly supposed that the tribe of the Mo hican Indians came to an end with Uncas, In whose honor a monument was dedi cated at Norwich in 1S33. Such, however, is not the case. There are a, few- sur vivors of the tribe living in the eatern part of the State near Norwich, and they liave made their existence known in a very marked way. In fact, the town of Norwich, as a corporation, and man) of its citizens, as individuals, have become defendants in a suit brought by the Mo hicans for the recovery of their ancient hunting grounds. These grounds are situ ate in the most fashionable residential portion of the city, and are of a great value as real estate. ." An attempt -was-.jnadr bythe tribesmen of tineas before Ihe lastsessIon of the general assembly similar to 'the one now made before the courts. The suit was pressed by a white man, a law)er, who mflrrfini n Mijinp Wntilcnn woman, and who acted in her name an5 that of her fellow; members of the tribe. He demand ed not only the restitution of the old In dian lands, but also an accounting from the city of Norwich and the present occu pants of the propert) from the time it had passed out of his clients' possession. In other words, the Jattep-dayj Mohicans pro posed to charge rent to the account of the present holder aiid.tlieiripredecessors an amount that In the aggregate reached a large sum. It was asserted that the'rlghts of the Indians to the propert) were se cured b) a deed of 16fT, which was only a confirmation of deeds and treaties of IfOO and IMS. The Indians had., special griev ance against the "present -mayor of Nor wich, who was one of the chief tres passers, according to their Interpretation of the old deeds -- -, This Is not the onl) bone which the Mohicans have to pick with the citizens of Norwich. In 1K3 the old Mohican Vj meter) was dedicated, the chief orator S tho da) being Andrew Jackson, Presi dent of the United States It vvas upon this occasion that the monument to Un cas vvas unveiled Things went very well with the cemeter) for a time, but of late )ears it as fallen upon evil da)s It was too valuable for real estate purposes to sen e long as the last resting place for the foreign Mohicans, and latterl) it has been cut up Into building lots, provided with streets, sewers, gas mains, trolle) cars, and all the other conveniences of modern life. "She gravestones of the old Indians have not been respected, but have been used to pave the cellars of the new houses The present upholders of the dignity of tho Mohican tribe re sent this treatment bltterl), but they have consented to overlook it it their an cient camping grounds are returned to them.

Itojnltj In Defense of Old-Tnslilon-ed llund-'Vlnde Lnec. (From the Iowa Slate Register.) Queen Marie Henrietta of Belgium is determined that the fame of that country for Its hand-made lace shall not d"terior ate If she can possibly help It, and be cause of the fact that the machine-made lace Is rapidly strangling the industr) of making lace b) hand, hhe has started a movement to bo)cott the machine pro duct. She has written to all the queens of Euiope and has asked their co-operation In the movement to "ave the lace making art, and the whole continent has taken an Interest in the matter. A boy cott by a queen is something new under the sun, and its outepme will be interest ing. Some of us have very positive Ideas about the question of bo)cotts, and many believe that under no circum stances is such a movement Justified. Certain It is thai, should the queen suc ceed in her efforts, the precedent formed will be a troublesome one, and she may )et regret that she takes such a decisive stand on this Important labor question We must admire her boldness, however, even though she Is placing a barrier in the way of progress. Queen Henrietta Is one of the most accomplished women in all Europe, and one who has been tho re cipient of many honors The Pope, for instance, conferred upon her the golden rose of virtue, the highest he could be stow. She is the daughter of the late archduke of Austria, and the mother of Princess Stephanie of Austria. A musi cian who plajs the harp and piano like a professional, a painter whose pictures are worthy of the Paris salon, and a woman of man) and -diversified talents she hon ors the throne. That she has the firm ness and strength to rule is evident b) the bold stand she has made In the matter of this bojeott against machine-made lace, for the sake of preserving an industry that emp!o)S many thousands. A "Woman Preacher of Talent. To the Editor of The Times: Not a few of the thousands of visitors who spend a Sunday in our city are often de-urous of knowing at what c-iurcll the best preaching is to be heard. To such inquiries the name of some one of Hie nalf-doien notable clergjmen are usual ly mentioned. Being personally cosmopolitan in my church wavs and eclectic in my theologj, I have gone here and there for thepurpa'e ,ot testing and sampling the preaching which the leading churches of our city are accuetoraed to fi.rnih Tills lias not alwavs been a profitable procedure, though on the whole, the experience has been valuable. But recently I have attended services conducted by .a pastor who Js a woman, and claiming to be a judge, I unhesitatingly affirm that the discourses which she, js accustomed to dtliver each Sunday are equal, if not superior, 11 rhinirs considered. toany others that are preached in Washington For dignity and grace of manner, punty and felicity of diction, clear and Just discrimination; for quality of thought, argumentative power and "trenglh of statement, for poetic lauty and spiritual insight in brief, for applied Christianity in its. truest spirit, the preaching of 'bis lady cannot be excelled in this city. I speak advisedly, after hearing all the local celebrities in this section.

BACON. Washington, Dm. L i IS AN. t- Senator Kyle Repudiates the Chicago Interview. WILL SUPPORT THE TREATY Misrepresented by the Associated Press Reporter Talked to Illin lint a Minnie While En Itoutc to the Knllroad Station Intend to Stand by the .Administration. Senator Kjle of South Dakota denounces the interview accredited to him and sent out from Chicago a da) or two ago by the Associated Press as being almost a total misrepresentation of his attitude toward the foreign questions now pending. Sen ator Kjle is not, as alleged In that inter view, opposed to the President's policy In regard to the acquisition of the Philip pines and the settlement o the other ques tions arising out of the war. Ever since last Winter, when the Maine was de stro)ed, Mr. K)lo sa)s he has supported the President in every war measure pro posed, and will continue to support him In everything growing out of the war. Un less the peace treaty contains some unex pected provisions not noted In the pub lished reports from Paris he will not only vote for it, but will work for It. He con siders Porto Rico a Fettled question, not open to further debate. In regard to the Philippines, while lie thinks that perhaps it would have been better had Admiral Dewey sailed awa) from that part ot tho world immediately after destro)lng the Spanish fleet, he nev ertheless realizes that we have Incurred certain responsibilities toward the peop'e whose fates the fortune of war placed in our hands, and he lias no deslro to shirk them. "I was much worried by the alleged In terview with me, circulated from Chicago by the Associated Press," said the senator last evening. "A )oung man who said he vvas a reporter caught me just as I vvas starting from the hotel to the depot and I talked with him for only a minute or two. I said that I was sorry the Philippines were to be thrown into our hands, and that I should have opposed an) steps to get possession of them had there been no war. But I certainly never said that I should "oppote the President's policy In regard to them I have alwa)s supportod such war measures as the President thought necessary. I was the only sen ator not a Republican who voted through out for the bond prov Islons of the war rev enue bill. "I have alwa)s been a consistent expan sionist, and from the first was a most hearty supporter of the annexation of Hawaii. In this I followed the general opinion of my State and section, which so clearly declared for expansion at the recent election. "I wish, even now, that some plan could be devised whereby we could honorably get rid of the Philippines. If a Joint pro tectorate could be arranged whercb) the people there could partially govern them selves, I should favor It. But the islands must never be turned back to the tyrann) and barbarity of Spain. That is certain. The rest will all be decided in good time. The first thing to do is to ratify the treaty and assume possession. Then American Intelligence will find some way of governing the islands with Justice to all." "You will vote to appropriate the twen ty millions, then, will )ou not?" "Of course. The twenty millions is a mere bagatelle when the other aspects of the case are considered." Senator K)le is In ill health, and will take no part in the work of the session until after Christina", and perhaps not then He had a stroke of apoplexy in New Vork last October, and has never fully recovered from it. His doctors tell him that a prolonged rest Is absolutely necessary If he wishes to regain his health. He looks well but keeps himself in strict seclusion. He will be In his scat in the Senate today to hear the Presi dent's message. AN 

UNEVENTFUL SESSION. Alcvvs of Mr. HIiiKles on tile Win ter's Work. Representative Dingle) spent yesterday In answering letters and receiving callers. He prophesied that this session of Con gress will be uneventful. There Is no tar iff legislation In sight, he said, the prcciit schedules having succeeded admirably. There will he no material change In the war taxes, Mr. DIngiey thought. Some "light modifications ma) be madebut no attempt will be made to. decrease the in come of the Government at this session. Mr. Dingle) thought that the question of a form of government for the Philip pines would receive little or no attention at this session, as It was quite likely that the treat) of peace would not be ratified until late in the Winter. He Intimated that he fivored holding the islands. He did not enter into a discussion of the conduct of the war further than to sav that ever) man knew the war had been successful!) prosecuted, and that every reason-ible man would say of the conduct of the mllitar) and naval operatlons'WeU done." The form of government for Hawaii would, Mr. Dingle) thought, come up for consideration, but he could not forecast the result He did not like to discuss these questions until they arose. There was too much time spent In making prophecies, which time could be better spent in deal ing with questions as they presented them selves GO TO THE POPULISTS. Galnslin Oron IiidiilsreH in a lilt n( Snreasni. Hon. Galusha Grow was entertaining Representative Horace B. 'Packer, nlso of Penns)lvanla, in his loam at Wllard's )esterdav when a reporter for The Time3 called to see him. "I have nothing to-saj," Mr. Crow cb served. "I never talk on matters upon which we expect to legislate. I am al wa)s glad to see the newpap3r men, an I will talk; to them on anj thing but th't which relates to business about to be presented to the .House for its aciioi. "I do not know how Senator Qua) will come out. His case is in the hands ct twelve true and good men, and they will decide what Is to be done" "What do jou think of the Philip pines?" Mr. Grow was asked. "You will have to go to some of the Populists. They know everything in the world and keep themselves post-d on the conditions of things In all countr.e6 JVe Republicans know onl) what hap pens In the narrow confines of our own native land and cannot keep up with the Populists of the countr)." Quallllcntlons of Sailors. (From the Jfew York Commercial Advertiser.) The recommendations made hy the official re port upon the naval militia seem to mix matters hy emphasizing ome uteless distinctions. In the fh?t place, it is premature as jet to Ax upon any c-las as oeculiarlv fit for naval militia service. The qualifications of sailors for our nav) have been modified, but the tendency ever in official circles i to recur to the standard of physical strength and daring set before ironclads appeared on the sea. Then the bu ly Jack tar, with a phtol in each hand and his cutlass between his teeth, while boarding the enemj, was the naval ideal of a sea fighter, but now it is rather a cool, self contained person with a precise eye for long distances and a turn for mechanical ingenuity, lou may find the latter in almot any occupation in the United States It would, therefore, make, too narrow a basis for recruiting to ahgH the value of the mercantile marine or to imply that the seafaring class alone should furnish the naTal raoirvc.

(From the Kansw City Star ) It is a superstition, not jet entirely eradicated, that machinery, which is sometimes called labor-saving machin ery, is a calamity to the worklngman. This Is not true of any great practical machine It is not true of the reaper. It ma) have lessened, here and there, the number of such laborers as Boaz hired In his harvest, but It made bread cheaper for Ruth. It increased the harvests of the world and made more abundant and cheaper the bread of the world. The In ventor does more to change the face of the earth than any other person. Man, In the earliest ages, with the rude, poor tools he used, could do little. Hundreds of thousands of men toiling together for years, might rear, here and there, a huge and useless pjramid, but the modern man, with the knowledge he has acquir ed Inside the last two hundred jears, abolishes distance and annihilates time. Ihe inventor comes and goes and leaves, possiblj, no trace of his own per sonally , save, perhaps, some drawings and specifications and working models, but he never leaves the world as he found it. He Introduces new sights and sounds and causes and effects. The first reaper that went Into a wheat field addd another to the sounds of industr), mak ing a. noise as it went along that had never been heard In the world before. That first song was taken up by another and another reaper, and so on till it was repeated a hundred thousand times. So, through the wondrous thought of man, these machines, that help man. that give him food or clothing and other things that he needs, multiply, and each lifts its peculiar note, and could all be heard at once and together they would blend Into a harmon) a ohg ot triumph telling of burdens lifted, and the life le Heved, and effort made effective.

' -'' OASTORIA. Bean tie ? TtiB Kind Yea Haw AlwafS Bought Signature of Cdajyjjffi&c&bi THE SHADOWS OF DOUBT Senator Thurston Talks of the Philippines. TILE ISLANDS MUST BE HELD If the Senate la Too Uncertain the Trent) May Go Over Constitu tional Limitations Do Not Apply to Xcvv PonaeaiHlona), Sitting in his library last night Senator Thurston dictated the following state ment of hlsriewr, on the top'.cs'of expan sion and terrlto'ial acquisition which now engage the-publlcmind to the almost total exclusion of other national questions: "I feel that the treaty should be rati fied," he said, "and if possible without any amendment. "Although I dislike very much to vote J2O,00O,000 or any other sum to Spain to surrender islands that we have already conquered, I feel that under the circum stances It was wiser to make that con cession, which will likely save us a vastl) greater expenditure by bringing matters to a speed) conclusion, and enabling us to muster out the most of our volunteer army and stop that great expense. "Personally, I share largely In the feeling of doubt, and one might say dread, as to tho acquisition of the Philippine. Islands. I have not been able to see any other outcome ot the situation. We cer tainly cannot turn the islands back to Spain, and to 'withdraw now would be to practically surrender them to the Euro pean powers for contention and spolia tion. "I have no apprehension that the ac quisition of the Philippine Islands will mark the decadence and downfall of this republic If there is a people fn the world who can claim the inherent capacity to acquire territory, civilize It and bring It into a sphere of successful commercial and business relations with the governing country we are that people. "I have noticed considerable criticism over what is claimed to be the contradic tory proposition of acquiring these islands without having any immediate purpose of permitting their people to participate as citizens In the General Government of the L lilted States, but I do not see any. thing in that claim. Our Constitution, as originally framed, recognized the union of States, and almost all of Its provisions guaranteeing equal rights of citizenship and equ-il trade relations, prohibiting the lev) ing of of duties as between States and all that, clearly had reference to what might be termed the independent sov ereign States brought into the Union. ' Our Constitution speaks of the terri tory of the United States from an entirely different point of view. It has never granted to the inhabitants of our terri tories, either present or prospective, par ticipation In national affairs, cither by representation in the Senate or House or in the vote that has selected our Chief Magistrate. Our existing territories to day are disfranchised so far as partici pation In national legislation and govern ment Is concerned. The people of the District of Columbia are not represented in Congress. They are taxed without voice. Our other territories hae no vote in Congress except, a very limited right, as It has existed by act of Congress which may be repealed at any time of voting b) delegate representation on mat ters affecting the territory from which the delegate is accredited. "I think, under our Constitution, we are absolutely at liberty to hold new) acquired terltory in whatever way seems best for the present welfare of the ter ritory ard ot the existing States of the Union, ever to the arrangement of duties between our new possessions and the ex isting union, the only limitation being th wisdom of Congress as the situation develops. "True, it Is somewhat Incongruous to add new territory without any dec'ared purposes ot ultimately claiming It in the formation of States. But this new terri tory comes to us In an unexpected wa) as a legitimate outcome of a war. If we give good local government and ad ministration to the Philippines, it is a'l the Philippine people can expect, or the world demand. "I think it is true that our fathers had no Idea of anj- such expansion, but I I am also Inclined to believe that the world grows, wiser as time goes on, and that It is as much our right and duty to adjust our plan of governing condi tions as it was for our fathers to plan for the government that we have and as we, had at the end of the revolutionary war. "The Philippines and Porto Rico will, from a constitutional and governmental point of view, occupy a somewhat unlqu position. All, or nearly all of the terri tory we have added heretofore has been acquired by treaty stipulations, guaran teeing certain rights and privileges to the people. But we are nob limited b) any treaty or anj- polic) toward our new possessions, except such as mny seem wise to Congress, having in view the welfare of the whole country. "It Is quite within the sphere of our con stitutional right to eventually set these I people up , a BOernment. of ,he!r ow In an) event. It is ctiscreuitaDie to Amer ican intelligence and patriotism to antici pate that In the future policy toward the Philippines we will do injustice to other people, or will place them In such rela tions to the United States us will work to the disadvantage of our labor, manu facturing or commerce. "As to the probability of having the treatv ratified at the coming session, I am not sufllclentl) well Informed as to the Individual views of Senators to feel iustl- flecrln forecasting the result of a vote on tho treaty In the present Senate. It is evident there Is cotslderable opposition. not confined to an) one party "There Is considerable doubt, with the prospect of this opposition, of bringing the treaty to a vote before the 4th of March. It looks as it it might be some time )ct before the treaty In all Its de tails will actual!) be agreed upon. The Spaniards have "not )et abandoned their policy of Quibbling over the details of the treaty, and It certainly cannot reach the Senate until after the holldajs, letvlng, at the most, less than sixty dajs for con sideration by a body which will be large ly occupied with the appropriation bills that must be passed. 'The appropriation bills will necessaril) lead to more debate than usual, so that If I were to guess, I should say the treaty might go over to the new Senate "I do not believe there Is any question about the ratification of the treaty b the new Senate, If it comes to that body. The new Republican senators, especially from the "West, all represent constituencies that are practically unanimous on the general features of the treaty. The situ ation will be carerutiy canvassed, ana unless there is a certainty of ratification by the present Senate, the treaty will be permitted to go over. "The Senate, of course, can be called in extraordinary session without conven ing: Congress, and then there would be nothing to consider except the treaty, or rather constitutional executlv e business "

SILVER LIVES LIKE TKTJTH. A Talk With Ileprrsentatlve Dock ery of Mlssonrl. Representative Dockery of Missouri reached Washington last, nlgnt. He said: "I am a conservative expansUn'st, that is, I believe In expansion along the rljht lines. I am not that character of expan sionist who believes In taking under the protection of our flag every old'lh"ng' that comes along. The annexation of Cuba Is out of the question. There Is no part)' so base or so far lost to c n science as to advocate the annexation cf this Island. The word of this Govern-1 ment has been given that Cuba, shall te ' free and that the Cubans shall be e ven an opportunity to govorn themselves. This pledge must be kept. 'The Philippines will be retained. Thero is hardly a doubt about that, but exactij- the form of government that wl 1 be given to the island is an-open ques tion. It is too earlj' even to discuss this. The treat j- will not reach Congress until late, and the chances seem to bil that It will not be considered at this ses sion of the Senate. It may come befo e r an extra session of that body. "Hawaii will be talked about ag eat deal, and I suppose a form , of.. govern ment will be provided for the islands at this session, but I cannot, ot courte, speak authoritatively. I have heard that Hawaii may bo given a territorial f Jtm j ot government, anu i nave aiso nta u that the form of government prevai-ng in the District of Columbia mh) be ap niled to this new terrltoiv. "The NIcauraga Canal will come in for I a large share of attention. This water- way ought to be constructed. That Is expansion along the right lines. It w If help commerce and bring the widely sep arated regions of this country into closer touch. It will give this countr)' com mand of a ver) large part ot the world's commerce. "Tho silver sentiment in the West ami I believe In other parts of the cjuntry. Is as strong as ever. Like truth, ic will not die. Some of our Republican breth ren may claim that the Issue Is dead, but their wish is father to the thought If bimetallism were an error it would have died long ago under Its adversities Er ror dies from a pin scratch, but t:n.h "survives a c) clone. If our friends the enemy . belicv e that bimetallism is dead. I that Is their mistake . There will be a good deal of silver and tariff talk during this session, and It will be like music to the ears to the people who have for so long heard nothing but the Win or war ' The session will be taken up mainly with , the consideration of appropriation bi Is, i and these will furnish the text for many good, strong and sensible talks on tariff and mone)."
