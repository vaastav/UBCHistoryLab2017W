Flvo hundred invitations will be is- Twenty dnys until Christmas. And JiiRt sixteen more shopping days. Christmas shopping began this week , the bu > liig of holiday preHents not having been noted by Norfolk avenue ineroluinlH to any extent until the last two or three dujH. Presents , however , | are now being "laid aside" In uonsld-1 ernble niinibers and the coming week [ will see the special Christmas buying well under way. Never have Norfolk stores offered so complete and attractive a stock fur holiday buyers as Is upon the shelves of Norfolk stores Just now. Early Shopping. Tills Is the season of the appeal "to shop early. " It Is an appeal In the In terests of the customer , the clerk and the merchant. The early shopper bus of course the pick of the stock nnd the special attention of the clerks. Al though additional clerks arc already being added In the larger stores and the number will bo still further in creased. It Is always a physical Im possibility to give the same degree of attention to customers during thu last days of the Christinas rush that can bo given them just now. The majority of Norfolk merchants anticipate a successful season. TravelIng - Ing men say that over the country there has boon noticeable u certain amount of hesitation on the part of merchants to stock up heavy on ac count of last year's panic experience. The prosperous condition of north Ne braska banlshos the grounds for any such feeling In Norfolk. Sore at the Christmas Tree. Christmas tree merchants in Norfolk will be few this year. Norfolk busi ness men who have had experience handling Christmas trees are sere nt the tree business and few If any of the larger stores will have trees In stock. A number dropped the trees last year and more have deserted this year. The price of Christmas trees too may advance. Last year there was an advance and the forest ( Ires In the north are said to have cut down the year's supply. The Christmas tree business had been overdone In Norfolk nnd stocks are always picked and damaged. Last year merchants burned a good portion of their supply. Sunday School Attendance. Sunday school attendance , after hav ing ( lagged somewhat , is again en couraging. Nearly every Sunday school In Norfolk will have a Christ mas tree and program. The school of St. Paul's Ev. Lutheran church will have a big tree sent specially from Wisconsin , the birth place of St. Paul's church. CALL BACK DARING PAMPHLETS Said Suffrage Might Lead to Socialism , Even to Free Love.

Don't Kiss the Baby. ford l a 9-montIiH-old baby boy who has ; never yet been kissed. Hanging In i a conspicuous place just Inside the entrance ( to the house Is u set of rules nddrefmed to visitors nnd signed by the | father and mother. The following are extracts from the rules : Don't klsH the baby. Don't handle baby unless your linnds are very , very clean. Don't bring baby's face close to your own or to your hair. Don't iiUow 'baby to touch your face or hair. Don't talk , breath , whistle , blow , cough or sneeze Into baby's face. Wo want him to live.

An attempt was made last night to break Into the Norfolk avenue olllccs of the Durland Trust company. Whether or not the building was actu ally entered could not bo told this momlm : , nothing apparently having been disturbed. It Is thought that who over tried to get Into the building may have thought of the trust company as n bank. As a matter of fact the safe and vault of the Durland Trust company always stand open , It being the practice never to keep any money in the building after closing hours. Nothing of value therefore would have been found. Broke Through Transom. Who ever tried to got In first sought ( jutranee through n rear window. An effort was uiado to pry the window open but was fruitless. The transom over the back door was then broken , the glass looking as though an effort might have been made to cut it. The transom was then pried open , con siderable force being used. The door under the transom shows what ap pears to be footprints. A clerk at the Chrlstoph drug store says that ho hoard the sound of falling glass during the evening but thought nothing of It. It Is possible that the noise of the glass may have frightened the would- be burglar or burglars away. The attempt was reported to the police. Elks Lodge of Sorrow Sunday.
