Cooper stated that after telephoning he returned alone and walked into the barn, but did not search for Ross In the main part, but did look for Ross In the sheep barn, and than stayed in the main part of the sheep barn all night, not leaving the place until morning.

I, James B. McNamara, defend ant in the case of the people, hav Ing heretofore pleaded guilty to the crime of murder, desire to make this statement of facts, and this Is the truth: On the night of September 30. 1910, at 5:45 p. m. I placed In the ink alley, a portion of the Times building, suit cases containing sixteen sticks of eighty per cent dynamite, set to explode at 1 o'clock the next morning. It was my intention to Injure the building and scare the owners I did not intend to take the life of any one. I sincerely regret that these unfortunate men lost their lives. If the giving of my life could bring them back I would gladly give it. In fact, in pleading guilty to murder In the first degree I have placed my life In the hands of the state. —James B. McNamara. Los Angeles, Dec. 5.—James Boyd McNamara, who Friday pleaded guil ty to murder in the first degree In connection with the dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times building Oc tober 1, 1910, was sentenced to life imprisonment In San Quentin peni tentiary by Judge Walter Bordwell at 10:36 a. m. today, and his brother, John J. McNamara, who pleaded guil ty to dynamiting the Llewellyn Iron Works In Los Angeles on Christmas day, 1910, was given a fifteen year sentence. The entire proceedings occupied only twenty-four minutes, the court having convened at 10:80 o'clock and adjourned at 10:47. Absolute silence reigned as the sentences of the two men were read. Judge Bordwell mounted the bench at 10:23 o'clock and a moment later Attorney Clar ence S. Darrow, chief counsel for the defense, followed by Lecompte Davis and Joseph Aacott, entered the court room. Behind them trailed the Mc Namaras. "Are you ready to proceed?"" ask ed Judge Bordwell. "The state Is," said Fredericks, and read James B. McNamara's confes' sion amid profound stillness. "Is that statement correct?" "It is," said McNamara. "Then the court finds," said the Judge, "that the degree of guilt of the defendant Is murder In the first de gree. James B. McNamara, you may stand up. What Is your full name?" "James Boyd McNamara," said the prisoner. The court then began the formal statement reciting the indictment for the murder of Charles J. Haggerty upon whloh McNamara pleaded guil ty and asked McNamara If he had any statement to make. "I have not," he said. "Have you anything to say?" asked Fredericks. "There has been no dickering or bargaining in this matter," McNa mara replied. This morning he made public a brief confession penned by his own hand and bears many evidences of a man little skilled in letters. The confession covers one side of an ordinary sheet of paper and was writ ten with a fountain pen supplied by one of the attorneys. It is probably the only written statement of the case that ever will be made by the writer or his brother, John J. McNamara, who pleaded guilty of dynamiting the Xdewllyn Iron works. Judge Bordwell said against James N. McNamara he would also apply clemency. But he said It was not be cause of the merit, as to the intent. He then imposed a sentence for fifteen years In San Quentin peniten tiary, one year more than had been predicted. The McNamaras were taken from the court room back to the Jail. Their counsel left the room almost at once and the crowd filed out laughing and chattering. Judge Bordwell also left at once, returning to his chambers. The sentences were pronounced In a Court room, full of cheery faced spec tators, whose chattering filled the place when the prisoners entered and trailed them across the bridge of sighs when they left. The two brothers side by side, re ceived what the. law. and the court de termined to be a Just return for what they confessed they had done. The sentences imposed upon them, while seemingly widely divergent in effect are likely to be nearly Identical. John J. McNamara is 46. His sen­ tence, with allowance for good be havior, will take him well on the road to the sixties. That he will have a considerable span of life after the pri son years is not believed. Fifteen thousand people packed the streets leading to the hall of records, filled the corridors and formed a great serpentine line that trailed down the stairs from the eighth floor nearly to the basement One hundred deputy sheriffs were needed to cope with the crowd. In a little corridor on the eighth floor alone seventeen policemen struggled against the crowd seeking to witness the end of the tragedy. The prisoners were brought Into the court room through the chambers of Judge Paul MoCormlck In the hall of justice adjoining the Jail which were vacant today, and thus the crowd was avoid ed. "Counsel on the other side are well aware of the usual custom of granting clemency to persons pleading guilty." Attorney Darrow said. "This defend ant. by pleading, has settled for all time the question which otherwise would always have been in doubt. He saves the state great expense and served the state In other ways." "The defendant will arise," said THE EVENING TIMES GRAND FORKS, N. D. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5,1911. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED TODAY Washington, Dec. 5.—President Taft's annual message to congress was devoted this year entirely to the trusts, and "was vigorously ap plauded on. the Republican side of the house today, where it was read shortly after noon. The entire house listened attentively to the president's recommendations. The senate with Its late hour of meeting, 2 o'clock, did not re ceive the message until that time. Many senators had already been provided with copies from the house supply. (The message appears in full on pagv 7 ..of this edition of the Times.) Judge Bordwell, and commenting on McNamara's declaration that he did not intend to destroy life, he said: "The clrcumstaices are against that statement. The: man who will place sixteen sticks of dynamite in a place where you knew gas was burning in many places and that many were toil ing, must have had no regard for life, must have been. murderer at heart and not deserving of clemency." For the reasons of non-Intent, Judge Bordwell said he. would Impose the penalty of Imprisonment for life. John. J. Before Court John J. McNamara came next. The Llewellyn Iron Wfrks indictment was read to him by tie court. The pris oner said he had Nothing to say. Dis trict Attorney Fredericks, however, said that on tliia case the plea of guilty permitted consideration, but pleaded that the defendant, John J. McNamara, be given a few years of freedom at the end of his life. Dirnw'H Fee. New Tork, Dec. 6.—Not less than $50,000 was the fee received bv Clar ence Darrow for his services in de fending the McNamara brothers, ac cording to a declaration made here today by Frank N. Morrison, secre tary of the .American Federation of Labor, and custodian of the McNamara defense fund. Morrison said marc than $200,000 had been subscribed and that practi cally all had been sent to the attor neys. He declined to say whether Darrow received other remuneration for his services in the case in addition to the single fee mentioned. Practi cally all of the 8200,000. Morrison said, had been spent No report or state ment from Darrow as to' the way the money was expended ever was re ceived by him, Morrison said. The onlv communication along this line, he as serted, was a request for more money. Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, re fused to comment on the case. Will Search for Guilty. Indianapolis,. Dec. 5.—"An earnest effort will be made by the government to bring to Justice every man who was involved in the mast damnable con spiracy ever entered into in this coun try said United States District Attor ney Charles W. Miller today In dis cussing the federal grand jury's in vestigation of dynamiting operations of the McNamara brothers and others alleged to have been associated with them. Samuel Gomp^k president of the American Federal) uii of Labor was characterised ts 'in "unsafe leader" by Mr. Miller, who Raid it waa time for labor leaders "who stand on honest ground" to take charge of labor or ganisations. "The Investigation now being made by the government will be thorough and complete and an earnest effort will be made to bring to justice all the men who are involved In the most damnable conspiracy ever entered Into In this country," said Mr. Miller. "The people are entitled to know all the facts, and all the facts will be known at the proper time. It Is not a part of my duty to discuss the details. The time is at hand for me to act "There is no occasion for any per son to be misled by false Issues. This Is not a contest between capital and labor. Capitalists and laborers who believe in law and order must and will stand together. "Such unsafe leaders as Gompers must be retired. Let men who stand on honest grounds come to the front. The destruction of life and property must cease. Acts of force and violence must cease and all violators must be brought to justice." Duluth Aroused. Duluth. Minn., Dec. 5.—Aroused by the confession of the McNamara brothers, the central committee of the Duluth Socialist party has prepared an open letter, which in part reads as follows: "One of the most tragic fiascos in the history of the labor movement of the United States and perhaps of the world has just taken place. The cir cumstances under which the McNa mara brothers were kidnaped and de prived of their fundamental constitu tional rights to a fair hearing before extradition, brought to the defense of these accused men the organized so- (Continued on page 5.)

NORTH DAKOTA DRIUNAGE UkW IN I Traill County Case Now Be fore Highest Tribunal in the Land COKSTITUTtOIIALtTr OF THE LAW IS QUESTION WVOLVED Commissioners Were Enjoined From IiDiflng the Drainage Assessments According to the Benefits Derived From the Work. Washington, Dec. 5.—The legal con °ver the constitutionality of the North Dakota drainage law, enact ed in 1905, today came before the su preme court of the United States for oral argument. This marks the end of a long contest over the validity of this measure. The court's decision In the case is not expected for some weeks. The drainage law was enacted to as sist In the improvement Red river valley land in North Dakota, wnich promised to increase In value under the law. it provided that the county commissioners of each county should appoint three citizens to con stitute a drainage commission for the counts-. Petitions for drains were to be submitted to this board. If after Investigation and hearing, the drain age commissioners found that the pe tition was reasonable, they were au thorized to assess the costs of con structing the drain on property owners according to the benefits to be derived. the drainage commissioners of Traill county, N. D., were about to construct a drain in Haysville and Morgan townships, three property owners, M. E. Selish. W. H. M. Lyche and J. O. Staupe, went into the courts to enjoin the commissioners on the ground .that the. law was unconstitu tional. They based this claim on the argument that the legislature put in to the hands of the commissioners the power to levy assessments. Under both the federal and state constltu tions, Jt was urged, such a power could not be delegated. The supreme court of-North Dakota, to which the case was taken eventually, held that the assessment in this case was not such a one as is prohibited by either constitution. The case came before the supreme court of the United States on the ques tion of whether the law violated the "due process" clause of the federal constitution. The attorneys for the property owners claimed that levying the assessment against them and not against other citizens was not "due process" of law. This theory was dis puted by attorneys representing the county. FIND STATUS Independent Steamship Line Will Have an Airing at Washington. Minneapolis. Dec. 5.—The status of the flour city line, tlie independent steamship company recently organized by Minneapolis shippers, will be con sidered at a meeting to be held In Washington December 12. according to Information received here.

Difficulty Found by Premier in Securing a Board of Finance Peking, Dec. 5.—Premier Yuan Shi Kai is having great difficulty with the board of finance. He appointed a presi dent of the board, who declined to serve. The vice president left Peking after Informing friends that the situ ation was hopeless. The acting presi dent now has asked for a leave of ab sence on the ground of illness but real ly because he was summoned before the national assembly. A sensation has been caused by the discovery that the national assemblv, •he Chinese foreign board and tlie board of finance held three different texts of the (30,000,000 loan agree ment negotiated by Baron Cottu in be half of a Franco-Belgian syndicate This was discovered, it is said, when a representative of the Chinese for eign board appeared before the na tl nal assembly in secret session. It Is on this Ipan that China's future form of government practlcallv de pends. Consular advices that the three davs armistic at Wu Chang terminates Wed nesday morning, but that it probably will be renewed. Delegates from the rebel provinces are arriving at Wu Chang and Yuan Shi Kal'8 represen tatives are already there. According to Russian official reports Urga. capntal of Mongolia, has de clared the autonomy of the central province, and only the Amban. or Chi nese representative, has asked the Mongol prince's permission to depart. The Amban. however, still remains in Urga, because of the Issuance of a proclamation assuring protection to all the Chinese. If all reports are correct there is a strange association of Japanese with the rebels in south Manchuria. Here tofore fear of Japanese aggression has prevented the Chinese from accepting the assistance of the Japanese. American Troops.

In addition to the Seventh Infantry already aboard she will embark the Twentieth infan try, about 500 strong. The Thomas will remain at Manila until the situa tion clears. The report that some Japanese are taking part in the Chinese rebellion appears to be confirmed by a cable gram received at the state department from the American consul at Mukden.

The work already done and the problems still to be overcome in the United States were presented before the con gress in these figures: Twelve million acres already lrri« gated. Thirty-six million acres still to bd irrigated. Eight million acres swamp lands t® be reclaimed. .. Dra,n the swamp lands and water the arid lands and thus relieve the congested cities of their surplus popu lation, was the burden of many speeches by the experts who are to fill the program until the adjournment Saturday. B. A. Fowler, president of the con gress, announced the rc eipt of a mes sage from President Taft. Dr. F. H. Newell, director of tha United States reclamation service, R. P. Teele, In charge of the Irrigation statistics bureau of the census depart ment, and Senator Wm. E. Borah of Idaho were the chief speakers thla afternoon. President's Address. address of President H. The 1 spoke in part of today's session. as follows: "More than nine years have passed since the national irrigation act be came a law and the reclamation serv ice was organized." said President Fowler in taking up the subject of the proposed amendments. "As anticipat ed by its friends, the act has in prac tice demonstrated some weaknesses, which could not be foreseen, but ought to be corrected. "1. 'The time limit of ten years in wnich to return to the government in equal annual payments the cost of construction of a project is now recog nised as too short, and the necessity of- an extension is admitted. '•2. Theoretically, Irrigated lands under any government project ought to furnish the best of security for con servative mortgage loans at low In terest. But outside capital heBitates to offer itself for such loans because in case of foreclosure, the act operates against the mortgagee and prevents him as a non-resident from securing title. This ought to be remedied in the interest of both sides. "3. Experience has shown that when any project is more than half completed, acreage property has so depreciated In value that the oppor tunity for the speculator as such or the large -capitalist has -one forever, and the time has come when the own er should no longer be required to live on these lands." Regarding the reclamation of swamp lands. President Fowler said in part: "In addition to the land area avail able for. reclamation through irriga tion, there are about eighty million acres of swamp and overflow lands not now inhabitable but susceptible to drainage. "Though these wet lands are mostlv along the gulf and Atlantic slopes, with considerable are in the Pacific states, they are distributed throughout every state Generally of great fer tllty they would, if reclaimed, sustain a population of ninety millions of peo ple. While not yet settled or culti vated. except In a small way, most of the wet lands have been ceded to states and have passed Into private ownership. By far the greater por tion of the area, (for example, in the lower Mississippi region), is so located that drainage propec.ts would neces sarily affect several states, so that the drainage problem is essentially inter state, involving federal action with that of the states. It is clear that one of the great needs is the extension of reclamation over the wet lands, and it is important that the action be taken by state leg islatures and congress in co-operation with private owners at an early date. "Thus far no attempt has been made to formulate a policy looking to the reclamation of our wet lands bv drain age. But it Is hoped that the delibera tions of this meeting will at least point a way to the adoption of a wise mode of procedure.
