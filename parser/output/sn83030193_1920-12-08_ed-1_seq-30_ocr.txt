If the present session, with no election on its mind, in a period when Hie country is in dire need of extra legislative aid, can find no time to make even a start toward meeting these two great national needs, what in the name of representative govern mentis the use of Congress! THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. THE first thing that will be noted about the. President's message to Congress is its insist ence upon two pressing national needs in-urging :which Republican leaders have committed them selves as completely as has Mr. Wilson himself. J The President says not one word about the League of Nations. ' But he has much to say concerning the imperative need of tax revision and of a programme of econ omy in national expenditure that shall include the establishment of a national budget system. In his message a year ago this montli the Presi dent urged upon the present Congress these same two reconstructive requirements. There was no reason whatever why this Sixty sixth Congress should not have come to the aid of the country twelve months ago by undertaking the revision of the income and excess profits taxes and by working out a national budget plan. Instead of that Uic leaders of the Republican ma jority let the country wart for tax revision in order tint they might put into the Republican platform a plank ailing for tax revision as a relief whicli only a Republican Administration could assure. With similar design, this same Republican major ity put through a budget measure containing a pro vision alculated to make certain the-President's veto. In his present message the President points out that the House of Representatives subsequently modified the Budget Bill, and declares that in its . revised form, "coupled with action already taken by the Congress to revise its rules and procedure," the bill "furnishes the foundations for an effective na tional budget system." i With the Presidential election out of the way, the great Republican victory won and Republian super strategy no longer needed, an the Sixty-sixth Con gress find the shadow of an excuse for not making a new start on the national budget plan in its present final session? Reviewing the Nation's current finances, the Pres ident says: "The fundamental fact which' at present dominates tho Government's financial situa tion la that seven and a half billions ot Its war Indebtedness mattrro within tho next twoXnnd a half years. Of this amount, two and halt billions aro floating debt and five billions Victory notes and War Savings Cer tificates. Tho fiscal programme of tho Gov ernment must be determined with refcrenco to these securities'. "Sound policy demands that tho Govern ment expenditures bo reduced to tho lowest amount which will permit the various sor vlcoj to operate efficiently" A close parallel to this may be found in the Na tional Economy plank of the Republian Platform. Do Republian leaders dare to tell the country that it need expect no start on a national budget measure until President Harding calls the Sixty seventh Congress next spring? v Likewise when President Wilson again urges sim plification and revision of tax laws which were de vised for war and which no'w burden individuals and discourage business enterprise, he is uttering nothing that is not on record as avowed Republian doctrine. Will the present session of the Sixty-sixili .Con gress refuse the country even the beginnings of leg islation for tax relief ? Proper treatment and training tor disabled figiit ers, economic improvements in agricultural industry and marketing, encouragement for new chemical and dye-stuff manufactures stimulated in the United States during the war, stricter regulations for cold storage goods, complete independence for the Philip pines and a loan to the struggling Government of Armenia are other specific recommendations in the President's message. But its chief stress is on those two urgent and shamefully neglected national reconstructive needs- tax reviston and a budget. Dwelling upon the present mission of democ racy, the President points out that one of the duties of the United States "is to prove that a great democ racy an keep bouse as successfully and in as busi ness-like a fashion as any other Government." Tax revision and budget-making seem to a vast . majority of the people of the United States a part 1 m' r . .a .... . nwonaKnoiiscKeepingjnai party pontics snouiu Just Lookin' Around!

MUNICIPAL FINANCE GONE MAD. MUNICIPAL budget-making has ended for the year. It has proved a sorry farce. Budgets arc never popular. They always man taxation usually higher taxation. The present budget is no exception. The rate, based on increased valuations, is about 2.83. 'I his, however, is not the worst. This budget is a thoroughly dishonest budget. When the budget is presented to taxpayers it alts for j5345,000,ooo. This is bad enough. It is an increase of $71,000,000 over the previous budget. But it does not include all the'items. An addi tional 27,000,000 for schools remains to be pro vided outside the regular fiscal channels. This the budget-makers. have omitted from the bill they now present, it will not, however, be omitted from the bill the taxpayers will be required to pay. Mayor Hylan fatuously reports that this deficiency will be met by voluntary savings made by the vari ous departments and turned over to the Board of Education. If Mayor Hylan honestly believes this he is gulli ble in the extreme. This is not the way in which department heads do things. If lie does not believe it, he merely adds a su perlative degree to the dishonesty of the budget. Savings could be made in departments., Useless clerks could be discharged. Economial and efficient management would save all of 10 per cent, in most departments. But the aving will not be made. Neither Mayor Hylan nor any other agency has the power to enforce such a reform. What will and must happen is that the Legis lature will take cognizance of the plight of the pub lic schools., Further expenditures will be author ized. Appropriations will be mandatory. These expenses will be met by taxes if not this year, then next. Jersey City policemen havo orders to "stop suspicious-looking hegroes at night" In order to put a stop to crime.
