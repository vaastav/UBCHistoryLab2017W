REMEDIES SUGGESTED, Not Repeal, or Amendment, but Cip plemsntsl Legislation Needed The Tobaooo Trust Decision an Effsotive One Federal .Incorporation Recom mended and a Federal Corporation Commission Proposed The Test of "Reasonableness." To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: This message is the first of several which 1 sbull send to congress during the Interval between the opening of Its regular session and Its adjourn ment for the Christmas bolldays. The nujouut of information to be commu Diluted as to the operations of the government, the number of Important subjects railing for comment by the executive and the transmission to con gress of exhaustive reports of speclnl commissions make it Impossible to In clude In one messoge of n reasonable length u discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to tin- utteution of the national legislature at its first regular session. The 'Anti-trust Law The Supreme Court -Deoisions. In May last the supreme court brnd ed down decisions In the suits in equi ty brought by the United States to en join the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch maklng and serve to advise tbe busi ness world authoritatively . of the scope and operation of tbe anti-trust act of 1800. The decisions do not de part In auy substantial way from the previous decisions of the court In con struing and applying this Important statute, but they clarify those dec! sions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to tbe literal con sti'uctlon of the net. By the decrees they, furnish a useful precedent ns to the proper method of dealing with the capital nnd .property, of Illegal trusts These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make It easier for tbe entire business community to. square with the rule of nctlon and . legality thus, finally . established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule of Decision, Merely In Its Form of Expression., The statute in Its first section de clares to be Illegal "every contract, combination In the form of trust or otherwise .or- conspiracy In restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations" and In the second declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nntions." In two early cases, where the statute was Invoked to enjoin n transporta tion rate ngrcemeut between Inter state railroad companies, It was held that It was no defense to show that tbe agreemeut as to rates complained of was reasonable at common- law, be cause It was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and com-1 blnntlons In restraint of trade, whether reasonable at common law or hot. It was plain from tbe record, however, that the contracts complained of In those cases would not have been deem- j ed reasonable at common law. In sub sequent cases the court said that the Btatute should be given u reasonable construction nnd refused to Include within Its Inhibition certain contrac tual restraints of trade which it. de nominated ns incidental or ns indirect. These cases of restrsnt of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were instances which at common law would have been call ed reasonable. In the Staudn'rd Oil and tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the com mon law and In defining exceptions to tbe literal annllratlon of the statute only "substituted for the test of belng4 Incidental or Indirect that of being reasonable, and this without varying in tbe slightest the actual scope and effect of tbe statute In ether words, all the cases under tbe statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way If 'the court had originally accepted In its construction the rule at common law. It tins been said that the court by in troducing Into the construction of the statute common law distinctions baa emasculated It. This Is obviously un true. By Its Judgment every contract nnd combination In restraint of Inter state trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition -or of establish ing In whole or In part n monopoly of such trade Is condemned by the stat ute Tbe most extreme critics cannot Instance a case thnf ought to be con demned under the statute wtlch Is not brought within Its terms nsahns con strued. The suggestion Is nlso made that the supreme court by Its decision In the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade Is within the terms t tbe statute. This la wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law Is well understood and Is clearly defined. It does not rest In tbe discretion of the con it. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which In order that it shall be enforceable at ull It must be incidental. If It exceed the needs of that contract It Is void. Tbe test of reasonableness was never applied by tbe court at comman law to contracts or combinations or con spiracies In restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose uecessury effect would be to stifle competition, to con trol prices or establish monopolies. Tbe courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combina tions or conspiracies might be lawful if the parties to them were only mod erate In the use of the power thus se cured and did not exact from tbe pub lic too greut and exorbitant prices. It Is true thut many theorists nnd others engaged in business violating the stat ute have hoped that some such line could be drawu by courts, but no court of authority bos ever attempted it Certainly there Is nothing In the deci sions of tbe lntest two cases from vblcb such a dangerous theory of Ju dicial discretion lu enforcing this stat ute can derive tbe slightest sanction. Fore and Effectiveness of 8tatutt a Matter of Growth. We have been twenty -one years mak ing this statute effective for tbe pur poses for which It wus enacted. The Knight case was discouraging nnd seemed to remit to tbe states tbe whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev er, the error of that Judgm-mt was cor rected, and only In the lust three or four years has the heavy baud of tbe low been laid upon the greut Illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutions have beeu brought, and a uumber are pend iug, but Juries have felt averse to con victlng for Jail sentences and Judges have been most reluctant to Impose such sentences on men of respectable standing In society whose offense has been regnrded as merely statutory Still, as the offense becomes better un derstood and the committing of It pur takes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law we can be confi dent that Juries will convict Individu als and thut Jail sentences will be im posed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution. In the Standard Oil cuse the supreme and circuit courts found tbe combluu tion to be a monopoly of the interstate business of rcfitiiug. transporting and marketing petroleum utid Its products, effected and mulntuined through thlr ty-seven different corporations, the stock of which was held bya New Jer sey company. It In effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, di rected the transfer and pro rata distri bution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by It in tbe tblrty-seveu corporations to and nniong its stock holders, and the corporations and indi vidual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and nil agreements be tween the subsidiary corporations tend ing to produce or briug about further violations of the act were enjoined. In the tobacco case the court found that the individual defendants, twen-ty-nlue-ln uumlier, bud beeu engaged In a successful effort to acquire com plete dominion over the manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco In-this country and abroad und that this had been done by combinations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competi tion, control prices -nnd establish a monopoly, not only In the' manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin foil and lic orice used in its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Stnndurd Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the stat ute. There was' here no single hold ing company, as In the case of tbe Standard Oil trust. Tbe main company was the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling und holding company. The plan adopted to de stroy the combination nnd restore coin petition Involved the redivision of the capital and plants of the whole' trust between some of the companies con stituting the trust and new companie organized for tbe purposes of tbe de cree and made -parties to It and num bering, new and old. fourteen. Situation After Readjustment, The American Tobacco company (old), readjusted capital $92,000,000: the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company (new), capital $117,000,000; the P.Lorll lard company (new), capital $47 .000, 000, and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco company (old), capital $7,525,000. ore chiefly engaged In the manufacture and sale of chewing and smoking to bncco and cigars. The former one tin foil company Is divided Into two, one of $S25,000 capital and tbe other of 100.000. The one snuff company Is divided Into three compnnles. one with a capital of $15,000,000. another with a capital of $8,000,000 and a third with a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two. one with a capital of $5,758,300 and another with n capl tal of $2,000,000. There Is also the British-American Tobacco company, a British corporation, doing business abrond with a capital of $2il.O00.0(U) the Porto Itlcnn Tobacco company with a capltnl of $1,800,000. and the corporation of United Cigar Stores with a capital of $0,000,000. Under this arrangement each of the different kinds of business will be dls tributed between two or more compu nles with a division of the prominent brands In the same tobacco products so as to make competition not onl possible, but necessary Thus thi smoking tobacco business of the coun try Is divided so that the present In- dependent companies have 21.3!) per cent, while the American Tobacco com pany will have 33.08 per cent, tbe Lig gett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, the Lorll lard company 22.82 per cent and the Reynolds company 2.C0 per cent. The stock of tbe other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, baa been taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and has been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared Dull and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies bns now been given voting power which was denied it under the old organization. Tbe ratio of the pre ferred stock to the common was as 73 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character of the owner ship and control of each company. In the original suit there were twenty-nine defendants, who were charged with being tbe conspirators through whom the Illegal combination acquired and exercised Its unlawful dominion. Under tbe decree these defendants will bold amounts of stock In tbe various distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maximum to 28V4 per cent as a minimum, except in tbe case of one small company, the Porto Rlcan Tobacco company. In which they will hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine In dividual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock ex cept from each other, und the group Is thus prevented from extending Its con trol during that period. All parties to the suit and the new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpet ually from in any wny effecting any combination between any of the com panies in violation of tbe statute by way of resumption of the old trust Each of tbe fourteen companies is en joined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from bavlug common direc tors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. 8ize of New Companies. Objection was mnde by certain in dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in active business and that tbe settle ment tbat would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division of the capital and plant of tbe trust into small fractions in amount more near ly equal to tbat of each of the Inde pendent companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of the anti-trust law and Its purpose. It Is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of large capital in busi ness enterprises In which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. It is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when Its purpose Is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and establish ing a monopoly. If we shall have by tbe decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units Into which the capital and plant have been divided we shall have accomplished tbe useful purpose of tbe stutute. Confiscation Not the Purpose of the Statute. It Is not the purpose of tbe statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or Imprisonment of the Individual offenders, by flue of the corporation or by forfeiture of Its goods In transportation nre provided, but tbe proceeding In equity Is a spe cific remedy to Rtop the operation of tbe trust by Injunction nnd prevent tbe future use of the plant and capital In violation of the statute. Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not in the his tory of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by n court than that against the tobacco trust As Circuit Judge Noyes said In his judgment approving the decree: "The extent to which It has been necessary to tear opart this combina tion and force It Into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demon strate that the federal anti-trust statute Is o drastic statute which accomplishes effective results, which so loug as It stands on tbe statute books must be obeyed and which cannot be disobey ed without lucurrlng farreachlng pen alties. And, on the other band, the successful reconstruction of this or ganization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute is not to de stroy, but to reconstruct; not to de molish, but to recreate In accordance with the conditions which tbe congress bns declared shall exist among the people of the United Stntes." Common Stock Ownership. It has been assumed that tbe pres ent pro rata and common ownership In all these compnnles by former stock holders" of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single con trol of all the companies Into which the trust has by decree been disinte grated. This Is errotieous and Is based upon the assumed Inefllcncy and lnnoc uousness of judicial Injunctions. Tbe companies nre enjoined from co-opera . Hon or combination; they have differ ent managers, directors, purchasing and .sales agents. If all or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching Into the thousands, attempt to secure concerted nction of the compnnles with a view to the control , of the market their number Is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed, and Its prime movers and all Its partic ipants would be at once subject to con tempt proceedings nnd imprisonment of a summary character The Immedi ate result of tbe present situation will necessarily be activity by nil the com panies under different managers, ond then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company and stuguutlon by iinother. Only a short time will inevitably lead to u change In ownership of tbe stock, as all on portunity for continued co-operutioa must disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration iu the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to the Inevitable working of the decree ond understand little the personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set nt naught the sol emn Injunction of a court whose object Is mnde plaiu by the decree and whose Inhibitions are set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness unexampled in the history of equity Jurisprudence. Voluntary Reorganizations of Other Trusts at Hand. Tbe effect of these two decisions bus led to decrees dissolving the combina tion of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern wholesale grocers' association, an Interlocutory decree against tbe powder trust, with direc tions by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combinations of a similar history nre now negotiating with the department of Justice looking to a disintegration by decree and re organization In accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations without general busi ness disturbance. Movement For Repeal of the Anti trust Law. But now tbnt the anti-trust act Is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment of tbe purpose of Its enactment we are met by a cry from many-different quarters for its repeal. It Is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of. destructive competi tion between small units nnd to make impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of tbe cost of production tbat are essential to con tinued prosperity nnd normal growth. : In the recent decisions the supreme court makes clear that there is noth ing in the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mere big ness of plant organized to secure econ omy In production nnd a reduction of its cost It Is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or tbe aggregation of Immense size are the stifling of competition, nct.iul aud potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly that the statute is violated. Mere size Is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plnnts necessarily- eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this elimina tion Is in contravention of the statute only when the combination Is madu for purpose of euding this partlculur com petition in order to secure control of and enhance prices and create a mo nopoly. Lackfof Definiteneis In the Statute. - Tbe compluint is made of the stat ute that It is not sutOcieutly definite In Its description of thut which Is for bidden to ennble business men to avoid its violation. Tbe suggestion Is that we may have a combination of two corporations which muy run on for years ond that subsequently tbe at torney general may conclude that It was a violation of the statute and that wblcb'Was supposed by tbe combiners to be innocent then turns out to be a combination In violation of the statute. The answer to this hypothetical case Is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable tbem to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monopoly they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having It clearly In mind. If what they do Is merely for tbe purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of the bigness of the plant tbey are creating, then tbey cannot be convicted at the time tbe union Is mnde, nor can they be convicted later unless It happen that later on they conclude to sup press competition nnd take the usual methods for doing so and thus estab lish for themselves a mouopoly. They can in such a case hardly complain if the motive which subsequently Is dis closed is attributed by the court to tbe original combination. New Remedial Suggested. Much Is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation Intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest mer chants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discus sions which have been brought out In recent days by the fear of the con tinued execution of the anti-trust law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of nctlon ns defi nite and as clear as that which the su preme court Itself lays down In en forcing tbe statute. Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not Repeal or Amendment. I see no obiectlon, and Indeed I can see decided advantages. In the ennct meut of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair aud nre badges of the unlawful purpose denounced In the anti-trust Inw. The attempt and pur pose to suppress n competitor by un derselling htm ot a price so unprofita ble as to drive him out of business or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they nre re quired to give up ossoelntlon with oth er manufacturers and numerous kin dred methods for stifling competition nnd effecting monopoly should be de scribed with sufficient accuracy In a criminal statute ou the one hand to enable tbe government to shorten Its task by prosecuting single misdemean ors Instead of an entire conspiracy and on the other hand to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community whut must be avoided. Federal Incorporation Recommended. In a special message to congress on Jan. 7, 1910, I ventured to point out lie disturbance to business tbat would irobably attend tbe dissolution of these ffendlng trusts. I sold: "But such an Investigation ond pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects tbe comfort not only of stockholders, but of millions of wage earners, employees and associated tradesmen, must neces sarily tend to disturb the confidence of the business community, to dry up tbe now flowing sources of capital from Its places of hoarding ncd pro duce a hnlt In our present prosperity thut will cause suffering and strained circumstances among tbe Innocent muny for the faults of the guilty few. Tbe question which I wish In this message to bring clearly to the con sideration and discussion of congress Is whether. In order to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these busi ness combinations may be offered a means, without great financial dis turbance, of changing the character, organization nnd extent of their busi ness Into one within the lines of the law under federal control nnd super vision, securing compliance with tbe nntl-trust statute. "Generally in the industrial combina tions called 'trusts' the prlnelpnl busi ness Is the sale of goods In many states and In foreign markets In other words, the Interstate nnd foreign business far exceeds the business done in any one stnte. This fact will Justify the fed eral government In granting n federal charter to such a combination to make nnd sell In Interstate ond foreign com merce the products of useful manufac ture under such limitations as will se cure a compliance with the autl-trust law. It Is possible so to frame a stat ute that, while it offers protection to a federal company against harmful, vex atious and unnecessary Invasion by the states. It shall subject it to reasona ble taxation and control by tbe states with respect to Us purely local busi ness. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquir ing and holding stock in other corpo rations (except for speclnl reasons, upon approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations In different states, which has been such nn effective agency In the crea tion of the great trusts and monopo lies. "If the prohibition of tbe nntl-trust act against combinations lu restraint of trade Is to be effectively enforced It Is essentinl tbat the national govern ment shall provide for the creation of nationnl corporations to carry on a le gitimate business throughout the Unit ed Stntes. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with re spect to foreign corporations make It difficult. If uot impossible, for one cor poration to comply with their require ments so ns to curry on business iu a number of different states." I renew tbe recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to engage lu trade and com merce among the stntes und with for eign stations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law and every explanation which was nt that time offered to possible objections has been confirmed by our experience since the enforcement of the anti-trust stat ute has resulted in the actual dissolu tion of active commercial organiza tions. it is even more manifest now than It was then that lbs denunciation of conspiracies in restraint of trade should not and does not mean the de nial of organizations large enough o be Intrusted with our Interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clenr now than It was then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up nnd regulation of legitimate na tional nnd foreign commerce. Government Administrative Experts Needed to Aid Courts la Trust Dissolutions. , The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of tlie present tiusts, with a view to their reorganization Into le gitimate corporations, bus made It es pecially apparent that the courts are not provided with the administrative machinery to make the necessary in quiries preparatory to reorganization or to pursue such Inquiries, and they should be empowered to invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations In determining the suitable reorganiza tion of the disintegrated parts. The circuit court and the attorney general were greatly aided in framing the de cree In the tobacco trust dissolution by an expert from the bureau of corpora tions. Federal Corporation Commission Pro posed. I do not set forth in detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation per mitting nnd aiding the formation of combinations of capital into federal corporations. They should be subjecf to rigid rules ns to their organization and procedure. Including effective pub licity, and to the closest supervision as to the Issue of slock nnd bonds by on executive bureau or commission lu the department of commerce and labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that Incorporation under n federal law could not exempt the com pany thus formed and its Ineorpcrators and managers from prosecution under the nntl-trust law for subsequent Il legal conduct, but the publicity of Its procedure and the opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of Its transactions would offer it ns great se curity against successful prosecutlous for violations ot tbe law as would be practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be invested also with the duty already referred to of aiding courts In tbe dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. It should be an executive tribunal of the dignity and power of tbe comptroller of the cur rency or the Interstate commerce com mission, which now exercises supervis ory power over lmportnnt classes of corporations under federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal In corporation Inw would offer ample op-l portunlty to prevent many manifest; evils in corporate management today, i including irresponsibility of control in tbe bands of the few who are not the real owners. j Incorporation Voluntary. i I recommend that the federal char ters thus to be granted shall be volun tary, at least until experience Justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from tbe operation of great, businesses under tbe protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of tBe law. Other large combinations that! fnil to take advantage of tbe federal i incorporation will not have a right to) complain If their failure is ascribed to, unwillingness to submit their transac-' tions to the careful oOlclnl scrutiny,: competent supervision and publicity attendant upon the enjoyment of such1 a charter. Only Supplemental Legislation Needed.' Tbe opportunity thus suggested for federal incorporation, It seems to me. Is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring of great industrial enterprises to the rule of action laid down by tbe anti-trust law. This statute as construed by tbe supreme court must continue to be the line of distinction for legitimate busi ness. It must be enforced unless we are to banish individualism from all business nnd reduce It to one common system of regulation or control of prices like tbat which now prevails with respect to public utilities and which when applied to all business would be a long step toward state so cialism. Importance of the Anti-trust Act. ' The anti trust act is the expression of the effort of a freedom loving peo ple to preserve equality of opportunity. It Is the result of the confident deter mination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserving un controlled and unrestricted tbe enter prise of the Individual, bis Industry, his Ingenuity, his Intelligence and bis independent courage. For twenty years or more this stat ute has been upon the statute book. All knew Its general purpose and ap proved. ; Many of Its violators were cynical over Its assumed Impotence, it seemed Impossible of enforcement. Slowly the mills of the courts ground, nnd only gradually did the majesty of the luw.as8ert Itself. Many of Its statesmen-authors died before It be came n living force, and they ond oth ers saw the evil grow which they bad hoped to destroy. Now Its efficacy Is seen; now Its power Is heavy; now Its object Is near achievement Now we hear the call for Its repeal on the plea that It Interferes with business pros perity, nnd we are advised In most general terms how by some other stat ute nnd In some other way the evil we nre Just stamping out can be cured if we only abandon this work of twen ty years and try nnother experiment for another term of years. It is said that tbe act has not done good. Can this be said in the face of the effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way, so drastic or lnhlbltlve In detail as ei ther the Standard Oil decree or tbe tobacco decree. But did It not stop for all time the then powerful move ment toward tbe control of all the railroads of the country In a single hnnd?
