Washington, December Ist.—Following is President Harrison's message in full as read at the opening of Congress to-day : 7. the Senate and Be ist oj Bq rt ■■■ tta ;■-.-.- The reports of the several Executive Depirtments, wl_ich will be laid before Congress in the usu-i! course, will exhibit iv detail the operations of the Government for the last fi-c-.l year. Only the more important incidents and results, and chiefly such as may be tbe foundation of the recommendations I shall offer, will be referred to in this annual ni.-ssage. Tli3 vast and iu creasing business oi the Government has been transacted by the several departments during the year with faithfulness, energy an-l tuci ■ ss Kevenues amounting to above 5450 I have been collected and disbursed, without re vealing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case of dtfalcat.iou, or emb. zzlemeut. An ecrne.-t effort has been made to stimulate a sense of re sponsibility and public duty in all officers and employes of every grade, and the work done by them has almo.-t wholly escaped unf-tvorable criticism. I speak of these matters with fre-; dom, because the credit of thia good woik is not mine, but is shared by the heads of the several departments, with the great body of faithful officers and employes whosorve under them. The closest scrutiny of Congress is invited to al! the methods of administration and to every item of expenditure. 

RELATIONS WITH .OREION COfNTr.IES. The friendly relations of our countiy with Europe and of the Eist have been undisturbed, while the ties of good will end common interest that bind us to the Statesof tiie Western Hemis phere have been notably strengthened by the conference held in this Capital to consider measures for the general welfare. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by Con gress, tbe representatives oi independent States of the American Continent and of Havti met in conference in this Ca.ital in October! 188!), and continued in session until the l_:hof la-t April. This conference marks a most interesting and continental ep-.ch in the history o' the Western Hemisphere, It is noteworthy tbat Braz 1, in vitetl un.ersn imperial form of government, shared as a republic in the deliberations and re sults of the conference, ihe recommendations of this conference were ail transmitted to Con gress at the last session. The International Marine Congress, which sat in Washington last winter, achieved a very grati fying result. The regulations suggeste'l have beeu brought to the attention of ah the Govern ments represented, and their general adoption is confidently expected. The legislatim of Congress at the last session is in conformity with the proposition of the Con ference, and the proclamation therein provid-d will oe issued when the other Powers have given notice of adhesion. SLAVE TP.ADE IN AFP.ICA. The Conference at Brussels to device meaus tor suppressing the slave trade in Africa afford d an opportunity for a new expression of th 3 interest the Americau people feel in that work. It soon became evident that the measure pro posed would tax the resources of the Congo basin beyond the revenue available under the general Act of Berlin of 1864. The United States not being a party to that Act, could mt share in its revision, but by a separate Act the Independ ent State of tbe Congo was freed from the re strictions upon a customs revenue. The demoralizing and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claims the earnest attention of the Conference, and the delegates of the United States were foremost in advancing measures lor its repression. An ac cord was reached, the influence of which will be very helpful, and will extend over a wi ie region, as soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Netherlands, for a time withheld. The general Acts will be submitted for ratification by the Senate. Meanwhile, negotiations have been opened for a new and complete treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between the United States and the Independent State of Congo. K__l-tiii.it OW UKAZIL Toward the end of the past year the inde pendent Imperial Government on the Western Continent, that of Brazil, ceased to exist, and was succeeded by a Republic. Diplomatic rela tions were at once established with the new Government, but it was not completely recog nized until an opportunity had beeu offered to ascertain that it had popular approval and sup port. When the course of events had yielded the assurance of this fact, no time was lost in extending to the new Government a fu',l and cordial welcome into the family of American commerce It is confidently believed that the good relations of the two nations will be pre served, and that the future will witness an in creased intimacy of intercours. and an expan sion of their mutual commerce. PEA( E OF CESTEAL ASIEI.ICA. The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a re-olutionarv change in Salvador, which was no: r cognized"by the other States, and hostilities broke out between Salva dor and Guatemala, threateniug to involve all Central America in tbe conflict, and to undo the progress which had been made towar.i a union of tneir interests. Tbe efforts of this Govern ment were promptly and zealously exerted to compose their differences, and through the ac tive efforts of tbe representative of the United States a provisional treaty of peace was sigued on August 26th, whereby the right of the Re public of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. General Ezeta, the Chief ofthe Provisional Government, has since been confirmed in the Presidency by the Assembly and diplomatic recogniliju duly followed. THB nAP.r.CND.'A 

KILLING. The killing cf General Barruudia on board the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco, while anchored in transit in the port ot San Jose de Guatemala, demanded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt to iuvadc Guatemala from Mexican territory, General Barrundia took passage at Acapulco for Pan ama. The consent of the representatives of the United States was sought to effect his s izure, first at Champeric, where the steamer touched, and afterward at San Jose. The Captain of the steamer refused to give up his passenger with out a written order from the United Sta'es Minister. The latter forwarded the desired letter, stipulating as the condition of his action, that General Barrundia's life should be spared, and that he should b tried only forcfleuses growing out of his insurrectionary movements. This letter was produced to the Captain of the Acapulco by the militar/ commander at San Jose, as his warrant to take the passenger from the steamer. General Barrundia resisted cap ture and was killed. It being evident that the Minister, Mr. Miz ner, had exceeded the bounds of his authority in interfering, in compliance with the demauds of the Guatemalan authorities, to authorize and effect, in violation of precedent, tte seiz ures on a vessel of the United States of a passen ger of transit, charged with political offenses, in order that he might be tried for such offenses under what was described as martial law, this Government was constrained to disavow Mr. Miznei's ac. and recall him from his post. NICAHAGUA CANAi.

Our relations with China, which have for sev eral years occupied so important a place in our diplomatic history, have called for careful con siueration. and hive been the subject of mu^h correspondence. The communications ol the 1 hincse Minister have brought into view the whole subject of our conventional relations with Ins country; and at the rame lime this Government, through in L"gatiou at Pekin. sought to arraDge variou. matters and com plaints touching the interests and the connec tion ot our .it'z:-us in China. Iv pursuance of the concurrent resolution of October. 1590.1 have proposed to the Govern ments of Mexico and Great Britain lo consider a conventional regulation of the passsge or Chinese laborers acro ; s our Southern and Northern frontiers.

P.ELATIONS w:?H .BANCS, Our lelnt'ons with the French continue to be cordial. Our representative at that Comt has very di ige.ntly urged the removal of tbe re strictions imposed upon our pro .nets, end it is believed that progress htis been made toward a settlement. SAMOAN TKE.-.TY. The Samoan treaty signed last year at Berlin by represem.tives of the United States, G"r many and Great Britain, after ra;itieation and exe'-.ange, has be»an to produce an effect. The formation of the government agreed upon wil! soon replac? the disorder of the past with a stable administration, alike just to the natives nud equally to the three powers most concerned iv trade and intercomse with the Somoan Islands. The Chief Justice has been chosen by the King of Sweden and Norway, ou invitation oi the tbree powers, and will soon be installed. The Land Commission and the Municipal Council are in process of organ, zVion. A ra tiocal and evenly distributed scheme of taxa tion, both municipal and ur.ou imports, is iv operation. Malietoa is rescecicd ss KiLg. EXTRADITION TREATY WITH ENGLAND. The new treaty of extradition with England, after due rutificatiou, was proclaimed ou the 2_th of 1 is: March. Its beneficent work is ap parer.t. The difference between the two Gov ernments touching the fur-seal question in the Behdng Sea is not yet adjusted, as will be seen by the eonx.pondeii.e which will soon be laid before Congress. T_e otter to submit the ques tion to arbitration as proposed by her Majesty's Government has not beeu accepted, for the rea son that the form of submistou proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a conclusion satisfactory to either party. it is sincerely hoped that before the opening of another seal ing seasou some arrangement will be effected which will assure to the United Stars a prop erty right, derived from Russia, which was not disregarded 1 y any nation for more than eighty years preceding tbe outbreak of the existing trouble, P.EI.ATIONS WITH HAWAII. In the Tariff Act a wrong was done to the King'om of Hawaii, which I am bound to pre sume was wholly uniutentional. Duties were levied on certain commodities which are in cluded in the reciprocity treaty now existing be tween the United States' aud the Kingdom of Hawaii, without indicating the necessary ex ception in favor of that Kingdom. I hope (ongress will repair what mieht other wise seem to bea breach of faith on the part of this Government. CLAIM AGAINST HAYTI. An award in favor ot the United States, in the matter of the claim of Mr. Van Bolkeln against Hayti, was rendered on the 4th of December, 188S, but owing to the disorder then and after wards prevailing in Hayti, the terms of pay ment were not observed. A new agreement, as to the time of p.ymeut, has been approved, and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the United Sta'es for redress of wrongs suffered during trie late political conflict in Hayti wi:l, it is hoped, speedily yield to friendly treatment. EXTraWTION WIT 3 ITALY. Propositions for au amendment of the trr-atv of extradition between the United States anil Italy are now under consideration. UHIVEK-A- LONGITUDE AND TIME. You wi 1 be asked to provide the means of ac cepting the invitation of the Italiau Govern ment to take part iv an approaching conference to consider the adoption of a universal meridian from wbich to reckon the longitude and time. As the proposal follows in the track of the re form sought to be initiated by the Meridian Con ference of Wasl.i^_on, held on the invitation of this Government, the United State! should manifest a friendly interest in the Italian pro pocal. In -his connection I may refer with approval to the suggestion of my predecessor, tbat stand- Santiago wertat-t the expectation of an eariv and sutisluctory adjustment. mg provision be made for accepting, whenever deemed advi able, the freuueut invitatious of foreign Governments to share in conferences looking to the advancement of international re forms in regard to science, sanitation, commer cial laws and procedure, and other matters af fec;iug the in'treourse and progress of modern c_mniuuit.es. RELATIONS WITH rORTUGAL. In the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatened to interrupt the cordiality of our relations with the Government of Portugal. That Government sei.-?d the Pel agoa Bay Railway, which was" constructed under a concession granted to an Americau cit i/.eu, and at the same time annulled the char ter. The cjui-2ssiouary, who had embarked his fortune in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, was compelled to in voke the protection of his Government. Our representations made coincileutly with those of the British, whose subjects were al.-o largely interested, happily resulted in the reco.: nition by Portugal of the propriety of submit ting the claim f.r indemnity growing out oi its actiou to arbitration. This pian of settlement having been agreed on, the Interested Powers readily concurred iv the proposal to submit tne case to three eminent jurists, to be designated by the President of the Swiss republic, who, upeii tbe joint Invitation of the Governments of the United States, Great Britain and Portugal, has selected persons well qualified for the task be fore them. 

TREATY RELATIONS WITH JAPAU. The revision of our treaty relations wilh the empire of Japan has continued to be the sub ject of c;nsideration and of correspondence. The questions involved are both grave and deli cate, and while it will be my duty to see that the interests of the United Slates are not by any changes exposed lo undue dis.riminatiou, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfy the legitimate expectations of the Japanese Government, and maintain the present and long-existiug friendly relations between Japan and the United State's, will be effected. 

RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. The friendship between our country and Mexico, boru of close neighboring and strength ened by many considerations of intimate inter course f.nd ri'-iprccal interest, bas never been more congiuous than now, nor more hopeful of increased benefit to both nations, The inter course of the two couitiies by rai', already great, is making constant growtn. The estab lishment of lines, and those recently projected, add to the intimacy of traffic and" opt n new channels of access to fresh areas of demand and supply. The importance of the Mexican rail way system will be further enhanced to a de gree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a liuk in the protected intercontinental railway. I recommeud tbat our Mission to the City of Mexico be raised to the first class. CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH STAIN. The cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that by the continuance of the methods of friendly vi gotiation much may be accomplished in the direction of an adjust ment of pending questions of au im. ease of our trade. Tbe extent and development of our trade with the island of Cuba invest the commercial relations ofthe United States and Spain with a peculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special arrangement in regard to commerce based upon the reciprocity provision of ihe re cent Tariff Act, would operate most beneficially for both Governments. This subject is now re ceiving attention. REMAINS OF JOHN ERICS-.N. The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratifying occa sion to honor the memory of the great inventor to whose genius our country owes so much, and to bear witness to the unbroken irienoship which has existed between the land which bore him aad our own, which claimed him as a citizen. VENEZUELA CLAIMS. (>a the 2d of September last the Comuv'ssion appointed to revise the proc.edings of the Commission i.nder the Claims Convention be tween the United States and Venezuela of 18-16. brought its la. o:s to a close within the period fixed for that purpose. The proceedirg. of the late Commission were characterized by a spirit ol impartiality and a high sense of ju-tice, and an incident which was lor many years the sub ject of discussion between the two Govern ments has been disposed of iv a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both parties. For the settlement o." the claim of the Vene zuelan Steam Transportation Company, which was the subject of a joint resolution adopted at the last session of Congress, neaotiations are still in progress, end their early conclusion is anticipated. CONSULAR SERVICE. The legislation of the past few years has evi denced ou the part of C.ngress a "growing real ization o.'the importance of the Consular serv ice in fostering our commercial relations abroad, and iv protecting lhedomt.-tic revenues. As the scope of operations expand, increased provision must be made to keep up ihe essen tial standard o." efficiency. The necesspv or some adequate atOtOOXO of supervision and in spection bas beea so oftea presented, lhat I need only commend the subject to your attention. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. The revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30,1S*X), were 5463,963,080 55, and the total expenditures for the same period were 1358.61 \f>&4 52. The postal receipts have not heretofore been in cluded in the statement of these aggregates, and for the purpose of comparison the sum of 360,862,097 97 should be deducted irom both sides of the account. The surplus for the year, including the amount applied to the sinking iund, was £105.344,4-6 03. The receipts for IS9O were 816,630,923 79 and the expenditures $15, --739..71, in excess of those of l_s_->. The cus toms receipts from internal revenue were 811, --7_0,19119, while on the side of expenditures those for pens-ion? were SI 9,5.2.075 96 in excess of tte rireeeding year. The treasury .t-*t< ment for the current fiscal year, partly actual aud pamy estimated, is as follows : Receipts from al! source-", S4oC,o_o,(>oo ; total ex?.: dltures, ?3--_.i 00,000, ieaving a sur plus o: r52,0,j0 000, not taking the postal receipts i into account on cither side. The loss of reve nue from custom" for the Nst quarter is $25, --000,000, but fmm this is deducted a pain of s boot J_.,000,G00 realised during the first four •months of the year. For th-' y__r i»:ij the local estimated receipts are E-93,000.0fc0 and tte estimated expenditures I -7 852,3 9 42, leaving an estimated surplus of $16,147,790 58. which, with a cash balance of _'J 000, 00 at the i-ndins of the year, will give $67.1 !T 770 is as the sum available for the re d.inptioti of outstanding bonds or other uses.

The Act directing the purchr.se cf silver ' bullion, and the i.ssue ot Treasury ncies there- ' on. h. (.roved Ju y 14 18 0, has been adminis- j ter ('; by the Secretary of the Treasury with an ! earnest porno*, to get into circulation, at the* earliest possible dotes, the full monthly amou-t ' of Trea-ury cotes contemn ated by its pro- j visions, and at the same tithe to give to the market fur silver bullion such support as the : law contemplates, Theiecent depreciatio-> iv J tbe price ot stiver has been observed with re gret. The rapid ri-c tn price which anticipated 1 and followed the passage of the Act, was Irflu- ; euced in some degree t.y speculation, and the reaction (a tbe iesult cf the same cause and per; ' of the recent monetary dis"m bailees. Some months cf lurther trial will be neces- j eary to determine the permanent effect of the, recent leg 'station upon silver values, but it is! gratifying to know th. t the incre.sed eircula- j tion secured by the Act has eze ted, and will > continue to exert, a most beneficial influence 1 cpon business and upon general values. While : it has been thought best to renew formally- the ' suggestion of an International Conference look- ' ing to an agreement touching the lull use of silver for c .mage at a uniform ratio, care has j been taken to observe closely any change it i the situation a .road, nnd no favorable oppor-j tunity will he lost to promote a result which it is confidently b-lievcd would confer very large benefits upon the commerce of the world. The recent monetary disturbance iv England ] is not unlikely to suggest a re-examination of opinions upon this subject. Our very large sup ply of cold will, if not lost bvimpu'slve legis:a- I tion in the supposed interest of silver, give v- a ! position of advantage L. proaio'.i.g ti perm.-i nent and mfc international agreement tor the | tree use of . iiver as a coin met.!. Tee efforts of the Secretary to increase the ; volume of m-.r.ey iv circulation, by keeping i down the Treasury surplus to the- lowest practi cable limit, have bee.t unremitting and in a very high d-tgree successful. The tables pre sented by him ishowing the inereas. of money in circulation during the lost two decades, anil especially tbe table .showing the increase dur ing the nineteen months he ha; admiuistere_ the affairs of the Department, are interesting and instructive. The increase of money in cir culation during the nineteen moLths has been in the a;gre.ate SS':;._vsG.su or about 510 per capita, and of this iue ease only (7400009 was due to the recc-nt silver legislation. BOND PURCHASES, That this substantial and needed aid given to commerce resulted iv an enormous reduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge is a matter of increased satisfaction. There have heen purchased aud redeemed sine3 March 4, IM. 4 aIK . 41/ p?r cent bonds to the amount of 1-11,832,450, at a cost of 5_46.6_0.741, resulting in the reduction o! the annual interest charge ot 58,867,609, and a total saving of inter est ol ib £10,700. INTERNAL revenue. I notice with great pleasure the statement of the Secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year nearly 112,000,000, and that tbe cost of col lecting this large revenue was less by 590,017 than for the purpose in the preceding year. The percentage ot cost of collecting customs reve nue was less for the last fiscal year than ever before. CTSTOMS ADMINISTRATION BOARD. The Customs Administration Board provided for by the Act of Juue 10,18.0, was selected witu great care, and lis composed iv part of men whose previous experience iv the administra tion of the old customs regulations had made them familiar with the evils to be remedied, and iv part of men whose legal and iuiicia! acquirements, and experience seemed to fit them for the work of interpreting and applying the new statute. The chiet aim of the law'is to secure honest valuation of all dutiable meiehan dise and to mate these valuations uniform in all our ports of entry. It had been made'manifest by a Congressional' investigation that a system of undetvaluation had beeu long iv use by certain classeß of im porter.-, resulting not oulv iv a great loss of rev enue, but iv a most intolerable discrimination against honesty. It Is not seen how this legisla tion, when it is uuderstocd, can be regarded by ; the eitiz.ns of any country having commercial d-aliiigs with us as unfriendly. If any duty is supposed to be excessive let the complaint be lodged there. It will surely be claimed by any well disposed people that a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system ol quasi smug gling. WAR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War exhibits several gratifying results attained during the year by wise and unostentat ous methods. The percentage of desertions from the army (an evil for wnich both Congress and the Depart ment have long been seeking a remedy) has been reduced during the past year 24 per cent., and for the mouths of August and September dining which time the favorable effects of the Act ot June IGtb were felt. SS per cent., as com pared with the same months ol 1899. The results attained by a leorganization aud consolidation of the divisions having charge ot the hospit.l service recordsof volunteersoldiers are very remarkable. Tnis change was effected in July, 18"'.'. and at that time there were 4.C04 coses awaiting attention, more than half of these b-mg calls fro_n the Pension Office for in formation necessary to the a .judication of pen sion claims. On the 30th day of Ju.e last, though over 80.,000 new calls had tome in, there was not a single c.se that had not been examined and entered. COAST DEFENSE I concur in the r_e;mmendstions of the Sec retary that adequate ai.d regular appropriations be continued for coast defense works, and ord nance plans have been practically agreed upon, and tht re can be no good reason" for delaying the execution of them. While the defenseless state of our great seaports furnisnes an urgent reason for wise expedition, the encouragement that has been expended to the militia of the States generally, appropriately designated the National iluard, should be continued and en- I larged. These military organ- _.t.ons constitute 1 in one sense the army 01 the United States, i while about five-sixths of the annual cost of their maintenance is defrayed by the States. DEPARTMENT OF ;_ST_CE. The report of the Attorney (general is under' .the law submitted dirtctlv to Congress, tut as the Department of J.stiee is one of the Execti- : tive Departments, some reference lo the work done is appropriate. A vigorous, and, in the ■ main, eflective effort has beeu made to bring to I trial ai_d punishment all violations of the law. ' but at the same time care has been taken that fnvolous and technical offenses should not be ' used to swell the coffers of officers, or haras, well-disposed citizens. Especial attention is called to the fact of the prosecution of viola- I tions of the election taws and offenses againt j Cnited States officers. The number of convic- ' tions secured, very many of them upon pleas of . guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary re- ] -.training influence. There have been several cases where post masters appointed by me have been subjected to violent interference in the discharge ot their official duties and to prosecutions and personal violence ol the most extreme character. Some of these cases have been uealt with through the Department of Justice, and in some cases the postoffices have been ab.lishtd or tusp.-nded. , 1 have directed the Postmaster .eneral to pur sue this course in ail cases where other efforts failed to tccure for ony postmaster, not himself in fault, an opportunity to peacefully exercise the dut'es of nis office, but such action will not supplant tbe efforts of the Department of Justice to bring the particular offenders to punish ment. NATVRALIZATION CERTIFICATES. The vacation by judical decrees of fraudulent eertificatesof naturaliza _on upon bits of e-tuity, filed by the Attorney-General in the Circuit Court 01 the Cnited Mates, is a new application of a familiar equity jurisdiction. 1 Nearly one hund ed such decrees have been ' taken during the year, the evidence disclosing that a veiy large numb r of fraudulent certifi- , cates ol naturalization have been issued, and In this connection I beg to renew my recom- ! mendation that the laws be so amended as to require a more full and searching iuquirv into ali he facts necessary to naturalization before aDy certificates are granted. It certainly is no*, too much to require that an application for American citizenship shall be heard with as much care, and recoided with es much form ality, as are giveu cases involving the pettiest ' property tights. BOOK MAKING AND POOL-SELLING. At the last session I returned without my ep- ! proval a bill entitled "An Act to Prohibit liook u_s_.ingaud Pool-selling in the District of Co- i luml.ia, ' and stated my objection to be that it I did not prohibit, but in fact licenced what it '■ purport.d to prohibit. An effo.twill be made under the existing laws to suppress this evil, 1 though it 13 not sure that they wiil be found : adequate. j Tbe report 01 tbe Postzaster-Oeceral show* j the most |ir_my lug promts, in the wo;k com- I muted to his directi.a.

The passage of .he Act to amend certain sec tions of the revised sututes relating to lottenes approved September 19,1890, has been received with great and deserved popular favor with the 1 Postoffice Dep rtment, and the Department of Justice at once entered npon the enforcement ofthe law with sympathetic vigor, and already tbe pubic mails have been largely freed from I the fraudulent and demoralizing appeals and ' literature emanating from the lottery compan ies. THE NEW NAVY. The construction and equipment of the new ships for the navy has made very satisfsctorv progress since March 4, ISs'j. Nine new vesel's nave been put iv commission, and during tbi* winter four more, including one monitor, will be adriei. The construction ol the other vessels authorized is being pu lied both in the Govern ment and private yards, witt. energy, aud is w_tched with the mott -_rupulot_, care. The experiments conducted during the year to test ihe relative resisting power of armor plates, have bceu ro valup.be as to attract great attenlion in Hurope The only i>art ot the work upon ihe new ship, that is threatened by un ions! delay is armor plating, and every effort is being mad- io reduce that to the miriemm. It is a source of c.iirgratnl.itiou that tte autiei j pated influence ol tfces. modern vesse's upon [ the officers anil s.ameu has been fully realized, j Confi.ejce an-i pride iv the ship amm-; the new a-e equivalent to a secondary battery. Your favorable cot_iUi.ration is invited to tiie recommendatiousof the Secretary. INTERIOR DE-.U.T.ME-NT. I The report cf tie Secretary of the Interior ex hibits with great fullness ana c earness the ; work of that great Department, and the satis ; factory results attained. The suggestions mad 2 : by him are earnestly commended to the corsid : eratiou of Congress, thou_rh they cannot al. be givenp_rticular_-e_t.-U.H-re. * | The several Acts of Congress looking to the ; reduction of the larger Indian resereations, to ; the mure rapid settlement of the Indians upon 1 in Uvidual allotment, and the restoration ti the puolic domain of the lands in excess of th ir needs have been largely carried into erf ct *o far as the work w.is confided to the .Executive I Agieemen''; Lave ben c.nclnd.d siu»e : March 4, it.sj. involving the cession to the lnited States of about 11 725.0G0 f.cres of land ; These contracts have, as required by law, been Mibmittedto Congress iorratitication.a-.d for the appropriations necess.-iry to carry tiiem in'o ellect. These, with the Sisseton and Wahp.tou, S-.c and Fox, lowa, Fottav-atomies and Abseu lee, Shaw Dees and Cua-r d'A-ene tribes, have not yet received the sanction of Congress. At'entiou is also called to the f.ict that the ; appropriat:or_s made in the case of Sioux mi i dians have not covered al 1. tbe stimilated pay ments. This shoul -. be prarup ly corrected. If an agreement is confirmed, all of its terms should be complied with without delay, and | full appropriations should be made. The policy outlined iv mv last annual m<-s --' snge in relation to the patenting of lands to settlers upon the public domain has i-een car [ ried out in the admini.-tn.tion ofthe Land Office. No general suspicion or emulation of fraud have beeu allowed to delay the heariu- I and adjudication of individual cases upm their metits. Their purpose has been to perfect the tile ol honest settlers with su-.h p:ompt ness that the value of the entry might not be swallowed up by the expense and extortions to which delay subjected tbe claimant. The average monthly issue of agricultural patents bas been Increased about six thousand. PISARILITY PENSION ACT. The disability pension Act. which was ap proved on the 27th of Juue last, hss been put into r peration as rapidly as wr.s practicable. The increased clerical force provided was se lected and assigned to work,and a considerable part of the foi cc engaged in the examinations in the fi.id was recalled and added to the working force of the otlice. The examination end adjudication of claims have, by reason ot improved methods, been more rapid than ever before. There is no economy to the Govern ment iv d. lay, while there is much hardship and injustice to tie soldiers. Tne anticipated expenditure, while very large, wiil not, it is be lieved, be in excess of the estimates made be fore the enactment of the law. This liberal enlargement of the general law should suggest not only a more careful scrutiny of bills for special relief, but as to the cases which relief is granted aud as to the amount allowed. HIE MORMON QtJBBTIOH. The increasing number and influence of the non-Me-rmoa population in Ct_.h are observed wilh satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff, President ofthe Mormon Church, in which he advised his people to refrain from contractine any marriage forbidden by the laws of the lan j has attracted much attention, and it is hoped that its influence will be highly bene ficial in restraining infractions of the laws of the Cni;ed Mates But the fact should not br> overlooked that the doctrine or beiief of the church that polygamous marriages are rightful and supported by divine revelation remaius un changed. President Woodruff does not renounce that doctrine, but refrains from teaching it and advises against the practice of it becau-e the law is against it. Now, it is quite true that the law should not attempt to deal with the facts or beliet of anyone, but it is quite another thing, and tne only sate thing is to deal wi'h the Ter ritory of Ctah as that those who believe polyga my rightful shall uot have the power to make it lawful. 

ADMISSIONS TO STATEHOOD. The admission of the States of Wyoming and Idaho to the Cnion are events full of interest and congratulation, not only to the people of the States happily endowed With a full partici pation in our privileges and responsibilities, but to all our people. Another belt of States ttretchee from the Atlantic to the Pacific. PATENT OFFICE. The work of the Patent Office has won from all sources very high c mmendation. The amouut accomplished has been largely in creased and all the results have been su>h as to secure confidence aad co.sideration for the suggestions of the Commissioner. THE CENSIS. The enumeration of the people of the Cnited States under tbe provisions ot the Act of March 1,1590, has been completed, and the result will be at once officially c mmunlcated to Congress The completion of the decennial enumerations develops upon Congress the duty of making a new apportionment of Representatives among the several States, according to their respective : numbers. PUBLIC BfILDINoS. At the last session I had occasion to return i with my objection several bills making provis ions for the erection of public buildings, for the reason that the appropriations contemplated were, in my opinion, greatly in excess of any public need. No class of legislation is more liable to abuse or to degenerate into unseemly scramble about the public Treasury, and there ' shouid be exercised in this matter a wise econ omy, based on some responsible and impartial examination, ana a report as to each case under the geuerjl law. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of Acriculture de : serves especial attention, m view of the fact ! that the year has been marked in a vcr. unus | nal degree by agitation aud organization among I the farmers, looking to an increase in the prof ; its of their business. It will be found th_t I efforts in the department have beeu Intellig. nt'iy I arid zealously devo'ed to the promotion of the interest intrusted to their cate. A very substantial improveme.t hss been | made in the market prices of the trading farm p.oductsduring the year. The price of wheat . advanced from SI cents in October, IS;-, to 81 od% in October, 1890; corn, from 3! Cents to ! 50..; cents: oats, irom 29% cents to 43 cents, and barley from 03 cents to VSctnts. Meats showed , a substantial but not so large au incease. t The export trade in live animals aud fowls ! show a very large increase. The total in such exports for the year ending June 30,18' J., was j KS3,OOu,OCO, and t c increase over the preced'ug I year was ovt-r 859,000,000 Nearly 2uV .0 cat'le and over 45 090 more hogs were exported than jiu the preceding year. This exp.rt trade ill i beef and pork and in dairy products was very I largely increased, the increase in the article of ; butter alone being from 15,501 '.ITS pounds to ■ 29,748,042 pounds, the total increase in the value i of meat and dairy products exported be ng 844 - '■ 009,0.0. This trade, so dircctiy helpful to the farmers, it is believed will be yet further aud largely incieosed when the system of inspection and sanitary supervision now provided by law is brought fully into operation. Ihe efibrts ol the Secretary to es abii.h the heaithfulness of our meat tgainst tte dispar^g ng imputations that have been put on them ! abroad have resulted in substantial piogreFS. i The veterinary surgeons sent out by the De partment arc now adowed to participate in the ' inspection ot the live cattle from this couutry landed at English docks.and during the several months they have been ou duty no case of con a gious plenro pneumonia has been reported This I inspection abroad, and the domestic inspection ! of live animals and pork products provided for I by ihe Act of August SO, 1«*90, wiT afford es per fect a guaranty for the whoksomentss of our meats offered for foreign consumption as Is given to food products, aud Is acceptance will quite clearly reveal the motive of any continued ! restriction of their use. . hat having been made clear, the duty of the Executive will tie very plain SUGAR INDUSTRY. j The informatiou given by the Secretary of . the progress and tbe pr.-.spects of the beet sugar industry is full of Interest. It has already passed the experimental stage, and is a com mercial success. The area over whirh the sugar beet can be successfully cultivated i 6 very large, and another field crop of great va ue fs offered to the choice of the farmer. 1 The Secretary of the Treasury concurs in the j recommendation of the Seen tary of _. griculture j that the official supervision provileJ by the ; tariff law for sugar of domestic pro iuction shall be transferred to the Department of Agri . culture. CIVIL SERVICES. j The law relating to the civil service has, so far as I can learn, been executed by those hav ing the power of appointment in the classified | service with fidelity and impartiality, and the . service has been increasingly satisfactory- The report of the Commission shows a large amount of good work done during the yiar, with a very limited appropriation. WORK (F CONGRESS. I congratulate Congress and the country upon tiie passage, at the- first session of the Fifty first c ongress of aa unusual number of laws ot very high importance. That the resulis of this legis tauon will !)_• the quickening ar.l enlargement of our manufacturing industries, larger and b*-' --ter markets for our breadstuff* and provisions both at home and abroad, more constant ,m- I ployment and better wages for our wor.ing people and an increased supply of a «afe cur rency for the transaction of business, I do not doubt. Some of these measures were reached at so late a period that the beneficial eflects upon commerce which were in contemplation by Congress have as yet but partially manifested themselves. " .The yea-ial trade and industrial conditions throughout the country during tne year have shown a marked improvement. MERCANTILE BUSINESS. For many years prior to 18*8 the merchandise ; balances have been largely in our favor, but i during that, year, and the year following, they turned against us.

THE TARIFF. The apprehension that our tariff may again and at once be subjected to important genera] charges would undoubted ly add a depressing influence of tne most serious character. The general Tariff Act has only partially gone into operation, s.me of its import-rut provisions be ing limited to take effect at dates yet in the fu ture. The generai provisions ol the law have been in effect le-s thau sixty dayi. its perma nent effect upon trade and prices still largely stand in conjecture. It is curious to note that the advance in the prices ot articles wholly un affected by the Tariff Act was by many hastily as: ribed to tbat At. Notice was not taken of the fact that the gen eral tendency of the markets were upward from influences wholly apart lrom the recent tariff legislation. The enlargement of our currency by the silver bill gave an UDward ten dency to trade, and bad a marked effect on the pric., but this natural and desired effect of sil ver legislation was by nianv err.ne.us.iy at tiibnted to the Tariff Act. There Is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject ot tariff revision -hall be opened before this law h_s Lad a fair trial. It is quite as true that every tariff schedule is subject to objections-, j;- bill was ever framed, I .appose, thai i_ ail of rates and classifications had the f. T approval even ofthe party caucus. Such legislation is always and necessarily the product of a compromise. As to tbe details, the present law is uo exception, but in its general scope and effect it will jus tify the support of those who believe that American legislation should conserve and de fend American trade and the wages of Ame i can workmen. The misinformation as to the terms ofthe /ct, which has been so widely disseminated at home ar.d aoroad, will be cor rected by experieuoe. Already we be_un to hear from abroad and from our cu_to-n-hou.es that the prohibitory effect upon importations imputed to the Act is not justified Tbe imports at the port o! New York fer the first three weeks of November were nearly 8 percent greater than for the same period in 16.9, and 29 per cent greater than iv the same period of 

ISSB, and, so far from being an Act to limit exports, I confidently believe that under it we shall secure larger and more profitable participation in foreign trade than we have ever enjoyed, and that we shall reoover a propor tionate part cipationin the ocean carrying trade of the world. The criticisms of the Act which have come to ns from foreign sources may well be rejected for repugnancy. It these critics really be lieve that the adoption by us of a free trade policy of tariff rates, having reference solely to revenue, would diminish the par ticipation of their own countries in the com merce of the world, their advocacy aud the pro motion by speech and other form of organized effort of tbis movement among our people is a rare exhibition ot unselfishness in trade; and, on tbe other hand, if they sincerely believe that the adoption of a protective tariff policy by this country inures to their profit aud our hurt it is noticeably strange that they should lead the outcry against the authors of a policy so hope ful to their countrymen and crown with their favor those who would match from th m a sub stantial share of a trade with other lands al ready inadequate to their necessities. There is no disposition among any of our poo pie to promote prohibitory or leU.i.tory legis lation. Our policies are adopted not to the hurt of others but to secure for ourselves those ad vantages that ordinarily grow out of our favored position as a nation. Our form o* government, with its incident of universal suffrages, makes it imperative tsat we shall save our working people fr .in the agi tations and distress: which cheap work, that leave no margin lor comfort, always beget. But, after all this is don?, it will be found that our markets are open', i to friendly commercial ex changes of enormous value to other great powers. [ From the timeof my induction into office, the duty of using every power, ar.d Its influence given by law to the Executive Department, for the development of larger markets fir our prod ucts, especially our farm products, has been kept constantly in mind and no effort has been or will be spared to promote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market, except that we pay our workingmen and workwomen better wages thin are paid elsewhere—better abstractly, better relatively— to the cost of the necessaries of life. I do not doubt that a very largely increased" foreign trade is accessible to us without barter ing cUher our tome market for such products of the fina and shop as our own people can supply for tee >vages of our workiug people. RECIPROCITY. In many of the products of wood andiron, and in meats and b eadstuffs. we have advant ages that only need better lailities of inter course r.nd transportation to secure for them larse foreign markets. The reciprocity clause of the Tariff Act wisely and iv effect opens the way to secure a large reciprocal trade in ex change for the free admission to our ports of certain products. The right of independent nat onstomake leciproeal trade concessions is well established, aud does not impair either the comity due to other Powers, or what is known as ibe "favoied nation clause." so generally found in commercial treaties. What is given tb one for an adequate agreed consideration can not be claimed by another freely. The state of the revenue was such that we could dispense with any import duties upon coffee, tea. hides and the lower grades of Bugar an I molasses. That the large advantage re sulting to the countries producing and export in,' thtse articles, by pacing them on the free 1 st, entitled us to expect a fair returu in auy way of Customs concessions, upon articles ex ported by us lo them, was so obvious tbat to have gratuitously abandoned this oppor.unity to enlarge our trade would have beeu an un pardonable error. There were but two methods of maintaining control of this question open to Congress—to place all of tho articles on the duti-.tle list, subject to such treaty ageeements hs could be secured or place thi m all upon the free list, but subj-ct to the reimpo-Uion of specified duties If the countries from which we received them should re!u-e to give suit able reciprocal benefits. This latter method possesses great advantages It expresses in advance the coii-uutol Congress to n ciprocity arrangements affecting these pro ducts which must otherwise have been delayed and unascertained until each treaty was ratified by the Senate, and the necessary legislation en acted by Congress. hxrerience hasshown that some treaties look ing to reciprocal tradi have failed to secure a twc-tnird9 vote in the Senate for ratification and others having passed that stage have for ye^rs awaited the concurrence of the House and senate in such modification of our revenue laws as were necessary to give effect to their provisions. We now have the concurrence of both houses in aovance in a distinct offer of free entry to our ports of specific articles. The Executive is not required to deal in conjectures as to what Congress will accept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than au offer, but part of the bargain is complete; the delivery has been made, and when the entries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea aud hides have been placed on their free lists, such of our products as shall be agreed upon as an equiva lent for our concessions, and a prcclama'ion of tbat fact completes the tracsact ou, and in the meantime our people have free coffee, tea and h-.'.e-. The indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorable action by the countries from which we receive our large im ports of coffee and sugar, and it is confidently believed that If steam eoi.uiunic.tion with tn.se countries can be promptly improved and enlarged, next year will sho.v a _m gratifying [ncrea*i_a OUT exports of breadstuff, snd pro visions, as well as of Kune Important line* ol manufactured goods. _ WORK BEFORE CONGRESS. tJtl addjtlonßl t° the bills that became laws before the adjournment of the last sestlon some other bills of highest importance w_°. well advanced toward a final Vote, and now stand upon the calendar of the two Houses in favored positions.
