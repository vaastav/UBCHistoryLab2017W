THE CRITICAL STATE OF TIIINOS ON ray. Rio GRANDI:.-There is some danger of military complications on the Rio Grande that will materially shorten Mr. Seward's diplomatic labor "in thc settlement of the Mexican question. The liberals are still hanging around Matamoras, which is on thc South bank of the narrow river, oppo? site to Brownsville on our side, where General Weitzel has a respectable military force. His soldiers arc disposed to sym? pathize with tho liberals to thc extent of crossing the river, each with a musket and forty rounds of ball cartridge, and they can "hardly bc restrained. Weitzel himself evidently" believes that the Monroe doc? trine is " something more than an empty abstraction. Our war with Mexico, in 1S40, was accidentally brought on by Gene? ral Taylor in stumbling upon an armed Mexican force on a slip of disputed terri torv. The same thing may happen again, and Congress, as in 1840, may be suddenly required to come to tho relief of the State Department. Wc guess, however, that in President Johnson's message to Congress there will bo some valuable hints given to Louis Napoleon and his man Maximilian. If not before, wc shall have tho ground broken on this Mexican problem with the meeting of Congress.-iveto York Herald. 

DIAL'S SALE.-From the following report of prices, furnished by Col. G. F. Mosely, the auctioneer on the occasion, it will bc seen that some ppecies of property sold high at the sale last week. Corn brought from $1.25c. to $1.32?c. Flnur, from $14 to Sil.50 per barrel. Cows, of common sto:-k, from $20 to $05 each-thc blooded stock brought from $65 to $105 each. Mules went from S150 to $315 each. Horses went from $150 to $265 each; one colt, a year old, for $175. Hogs, fattening, 7? to to 10"r cents per pound gross; stock hogs, from'?ii to ? cents gross. Cow ie is from 70 to 90 cents per bushel, and other things in proportion. It must be remembered, however, that there was twelve months credit given, which makes a great deal of difference at this particular timo with almost everybody. For cash, it could not be expected that these articles would roach the same figures.-Louisville Herald. BISHOP HOPKINS.-We arc happy to learn that that great and good man, Bishop Hopkins, ol Vermont, is now making a tour through the Southern States for the purpose of delivering lectures in behalf of 8U.'h charitable objects as the citizens of the different points at which he speaks may designate. A lecture from Bishop Hopkins is an in? tellectual treat that we should very much dislike to miss; and we trust wc may be authorized to announce, in a few days, that he will bc here. Bishop Hopkins is a man who is entitled to tho respect of every Southerner. He ] has always contended for justice and right, regardless of section, and will be welcomed wherever ho may go in the Southern States.- Wilmington Dispatch. SAD ACCIDENT.-The many friend* of Rev. W. A. McSwain will be pained to learn that, on last Sabbath, while going to his church appointment, in the lower part of this District, he had the misfortune of get? ting his leg broken. It seems that a horse, in a vehicle behind him, became unruly and was about to get tangled in Mr. McSwain's buggy, when he thought it safest for himself to jump from his buggy, by which both bones of his left leg were badly broken above the ankle. This is the second time an accident has caused him to have a log broken.-Laurensville Herald. Tlie National Intelligencer says it is un? derstood that Count do Montholon, the French Minister, has made formal demand fer the restitution of ino tobacco recently seized at Bichmond as tho property of the late rebel Government, on the ground that the property seized belonged to August Belmont, the New York agent of tho French Rothschilds. Newspaper peddling in the army was a very profitable business, judging from the fact that one of this class who formerly peddled papers in the Army of the Poto? mac, is now worth $100,000, and is one of the directors of the Second National Bank, just started in Bichmond.
