The Boston Herttid suggests that those people who are outraged because Gov. ltutler's charges against Massachusetts were believed should not be in haste to believe what Mahone says about Vir ginia. The common sense solution of the (juestion what to do with the surplus revenues is to stop collecting them that is, repeal the tariff on tiie necessaries of life and thus help the g-eater number of people. mnm-mm j Cable, the novelist, is interspersing bis readings in Boston with what bo terms African-Creole songs, rendered, as he says himself, "with sufficient native skill to Miable any studious ear to pick out the tune."

"Tho influence of those journals in favor of the Hon. Samuel J. Itandall was just nothing nt nil, nnd .lid not add to his strength the one hun dredth fraction of a single vote."

He bad sUcn;; preferences, but should control himself, voting o.,piil ing to his prcfvMiices. Should he utiend the Republican caucus, it would beS.'.mply for conference. He behaved Ins opinions were shared by Senator ltiddlebergt r. THE HOUSE COttXlTTEES. Kpmkrr 'nrllle to Appoint the Very Be I On lor the . ,X Washington special says: In regard to the formation of committees, it is under stood Speaker Carlisle will, without regard to support in his canvass or ersoi!al pref erences, assign, as far as possible, the very best men to tho several committees. The Klcction Committee will.as far xs in his power, te made up ol the unrest men, Mr. Carlisle being oposed to making it stronglv partisan. Mr. Springer, of Illi nois, was the last Democratic t liairnuui of that committee. ; The Ways and Means w ill be formed of IVmocrats whose views ore in accord with those of the niajoritv. Naturally the name of Mr. William li. Morrison is asso ciated with the position of chairman. He tilled this position in the Forty-fourth Con gress, but was prevented from bringing tho committee labor to an end by the death of Speaker Kerr ami the election of Mr. Randall at the short session, when the turmoil of the Presi dential count also contributed its share to defeat the .proposed tariff revision. There is little prospect of New Unlaud having IVmoeralie representation upon it. Mr. Morse, of Boston, it is said, would prefer I hi) chairmanship of Naval Affairs to being on the Ways und Means. The New York member wlil l either Mr. Cox or Mr. Hewitt. Mr. Hurd, of Ohio; Blount, of (ieorrria; Tucker, of Virginia; Hancock or Mills, of ToxitS, with two members from the Northwestern States, will prohablv make up the eight Iemo- crats. Mr. Mills was a member ot that ienmmittec In the Forty-sixth Congress, while Mr. Johftllancock was the mcmK-jr in the Foity-ionrtU Congress. Of the live Republicans on the Ways and Means Mr. Anderson, of Kansas, who is for revenue reform, will probably lie associated w ith Mr. telle v, Mr. Keiler, Mr. Kasson and Mr. Newt.' To the ApprociuC'oNS Committee is as signed Mr. Randall and mui Democrats as can harmoniously assist him. It is likely the formation of this" committee will give Mr. Carlisle much anxiety. Mr. Bnekner, of Missouri, formerly chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, will not decline the leader ship of that committee, nor will Mr. James W. Throckmorton, of Texas, tlie chairman ship of tho Pacific Railroad Committee, held by him in the Forty-fifth Congress. The Commerce Committee will naturally go to Judge Reagan, its chairman in the Forty-lifth and Forty-sixth Congresses, and the Public Lands to Mr. tieorge L. Converse, of Ohio, who had it in the Forty-sixth Congress. The Postotlices and Postroails might still be claimed by Mr. II. I). Money, who was its head two ses sions ago. The Judiciary will lie one of strongest committees in the House. Messrs. Cul Issrson, of Texas, Hammond, of Georgia, and Hurd, of Ohio, served on that com mitteo in the Forty-sixth Congress. Mr. Scales, of North Carolina, would no doubt be glad to resume the chairmanship of Indian Affairs, which he has held three times, as would Mr. Cox of Foreign Af fairs, Mr. Muldrow of Territories, and Cabell of Railways and Cana'.a. Gen. liosecrans is assigned to Military, and Ieopold Morse to Naval Affairs. Casey Young will look for Public Buildings and , J rounds ; Bland, of Missouri, for Coinage, Weights and Measures; Willis, of Ken-: tucky, for Kducation and Labor, on which he served in the Forty-fifth, Forty-sxth and Forty-seventh Congresses, and Hatch, of Missouri, the Committee on Agricul ture, of which he is an old member. So fur, therefore, as the chairmanships of important committees are concerned, Mr. Carlisle will have but little trouble in rewarding his friends by giving them places they have hitherto occupied in the Forty-fourth, Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth Congresses. The composition of the en tire list will not be so easily arranged, there being over a hundred new Demo cratic members to provide for in making up the niajoritv list on each committee. The Elections, Ways and Means, Appro priation, Judiciary(of which Mr. Black burn will probably be the head), Banking and Currency, and one or two other com mittees will have the strength of the Democratic side. The unimportant com mittees will give chairmanships to a num ber of ambitious members. How soon Speaker Carlisle may be able to formulate this work will depend upon those whose wishes will be consulted in assigning them to duty with the several committees. APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1SS5. Khtimnlew TrnnnmitttHl to CcoerrM bjr the Nerretnry of tbe Trewtury. Washington, December 5. Tho Secre tary of the Treasury has transmitted to Congress estimates of the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18vS5. The amount estimated as required for all the expenses of the government is 28:!, l'.'5,:;05, which is $2-',3J3,2s2 less than the aggregate appropriations for the present fiscal year, and So7,154,S57 less than the sum called for in the estimates sub mitted last year. The appropriations for tbe present fiscal year, includ ing deficiencies and miscellaneous, are $:J05,44H,.")87. The estimates upon which these appropriations are based called for S J10,2S0,1G2.

The esti mates in the above cases, except pen sions, foreign intercourse and permanent annual appropriations, are for larger sums than those appropriated fo? the present fiscal year, flie appropriation for pen sions for the present fiscal year amount e 1 to (,570,287; ioreignintercoursel$2,177,.'S4 ; permanent annual appropriations, (-'117,-r2'.l,521. Some estimates which show in creases over the amounts appropriated ia.tycar are as follows: Increase in the military establishment, ?1. 001,05.3; naval establishment, Si,707,:iM ; Indian affairs, $2, 127,473 ; public works, $11,78!,303; postal service, $2,942,087 ; miscellaneous, 1,102,1)17. The increase in the estimates for the naval establishment is due to pro visions for completing steel cruisers, mon itors and dispatch-boats. The increase in the estimates for public works is owing, principally, to tbe item of $8,02.3.500 for improving rivers and harbors, nnd the in crease in the estimates for public build ings fioin $1 ,.301,:;00 to j:!,S47,'.)ii7. The in crease in the estimates for the ' postal service is to cover the deficiency in the revenues. The estimates for rivers and harbors are as follows: Kxaminutions and surveys oi tbe South Pass of tho Missis sippi river, 17,-300; ganging the waters of tho lower Mississippi and its tributa ries, iOOOO; gauging the waters of the Columbia rivur, $j000; improving rivers and luirbors, to bo expended on such works authorized by Congress, $8,000,000.

Yandcrbot was seen jnst as he wn e&torinic his carriam to go to the oiiera. V.x eusing himself for his haste, ho said he thontcht the election of Mr. Carlisle an eminently wise one. Mr. Henry Clews, the banker, said: I regard the election ol Mr. Carlisle a an excellent choice. I do not tt;!UK the question of lroo trade was taken into consideration w-hen the selection was made, but that the gentleman wu cho-.cn for his Mtiierior ability ami fitness for the position. He is ti man who treads on nobody's toes, and by his i'airnt-ss and g.md will for all lias made a host of friends, so that, when the time arrives to plaoe him in an exalted position, those friends clus tered around him." Several brokers, among thetn E. L. Clarke and I.. It. Itiuleau, expressed themselves a highly pleased w ith the choice and all were unanimous lu declaring they did not think Mr. t-ajji.le's freo-tradc principle, would be brought out during his administration. "There are oilier men." said Mr. Clarke, "who are less outsHken on the subject and who would have been much iitore dangerous in tiie chair than Mr. Carlisle.

Mr. Ksterbrook. the pen nianuf:tcturcr. who is IHTsvnally aciuninted with Mr. Carlisle, said be mrw the SKakcr was not a free-trader at heart, but for the sake of indiey.- lie regarded the cry of free trade as a party measure, inaugurated and kept awake by HenryAVatterson for his own ends.

His election will have no bearings on the financial Question." President Hatch, of the Stock Exchange: "I don'( think Mr. Carlisle's election will have an unfavorable effect on finances, 'the new Seaker is a very Tir, honest and conservative man, who apires to be a statesman rather than a dema gogue, so that so far as his personal influence goes I don't think he will further any very radi cal legislation or any legislation which bis judg ment could be convinced was calculated to be injurious to the country. Knowing Messrs. Car lisle and Randall both, personally I shonld not have felt that there would have been any great difference so fur as the business interests of the country are concerned, by the election of either of them." President Randolph, nf the Continental Bank, said: "The measures Mr. Carlisle hasoriginatea in Congress nffecting national banking, have not always been such us the b&nktr could applaud; but, apart from that, he undoubtedly possesses eminent qualifications for the Seakersbip." President Baldwin, of the Fourth Nationnl Bank, said: "I regard Mr. Carlisle as a man of great ability, who will feet tbe responsibilities of is position and act with a conservative regard to the wants of the country. I feel satisfied that be has informed himself to a very great extent upon the financial question, and I regard his election as fspenkeras quite satisfactory from a financial point of view. I think he will go very -carefully on the financial question ; be very conservative, and give neither of tho political parties cause for complaint, but he governed by what he thinks is to the best iuterest of the country rather than to a party." President Tanpan, of the Gallatin National Bank, said: "1 don't think Mr. Carlisle's elec tion will have anyeffcut on the financial question. I think he will gu slow, and do nothing radical. I sco no cause for apprehension on that score." President Fry, of the Bank of New York, also said Mr. Carlisle election would have no effect on the financial question.

An effort will be made to make the money out of his bondsmen. lfickeretafi' was elected three years ago and nau some trouble in making bond, and some things occurred before his term expired which made him very unpopular, but by marked shrewdness" he was re elected, and has been drinking heavily much of the time since. There is not much surprise over his leaving. The smallpox is' still spreading around Gadsden. There have been several deaths during the last week. One corpse was hauled several miles, in an open wagon, along the public road, to be buried. Many jiersons meeting the wagon took to the woods and coru-tields to avoid meeting it. It is thought the disease would never have spread bevond one family if the physician who was first Called had' known what the disease was and warned people to keep away. His error will cost much suffering and many lives. The Forked Deer has been on a big boom here for more than a week and the bottom cannot be crossed with loaded wagons again until late nest spring.' Cutting the drift liiose in the river luis benefited Jacitson and Prow nsville. but at our cost. Hun dreds of bales of cotton and thousands of dollars worth of trado will he lost to this place this fall and winter by high water and bad roads. a. o. i. TELEUKAPHIC BREVITIES. Chicago, December 5.

Admiral Peng Yu Ian, at Canton, has notified, all foreigners that war with France is immi nent, and is massing all available brad and sea forces for the protection of Can ton.

The yellow book upon tne lonooin affair was distributed among the Deputies to-day. It contains the Chinese memoranda, which Prime Minister Ferrv on the 28th ultimo gave to the Tonquin Credits Committee. Marouis Tseng regrets that France regards the oc cupation of Sontay and Bac Ninh as indis pensable to tne settlement of the question at issue. He also fails to see the necessity of France occupying those places which she is aware the Chinese hold. Marquis Tsens comments uion the state ment made by M. Ferry in the Chamber of Deputies, on the ulst of October, that the French government did not believe that China "would declare war, nor had r ranee any intention ot doing so; that France was desirous of firmly establishing herself in the lted river delta by gaining possession of Sontay and Bac Ninh ; that- wnen tnat was acnieved nobody would le able to drive her out ; that with patience, long froid and her forces she would be proof against everything, and that a prut dent policy would lead to the settlement of the Tonquin affair. The marquis ob serves that this statement produced a pow erful impression in Tonquin. Ii it became question ol the possession of Tonnntn. further negotiations would bo useless, as it will be impossible for China to agree thereto. On November 30th M. Ferry declared that the ideas of the French gov ernment had not changed in the last three years; that the French policy was guid ed by the principles which "formed the basis of the treaty of 1874. The govern ment desired consolidation, a F'renchpro tectorate, the free navivatio of the Tong koi river and security for its commercial relations in Tonquin. The Marquis Tseng having renewed the proposal to fix the line of demarcation between the armies in the cantonments of Hanoi and at Sontay and on the banks of Red river. Ferrv pointed out that Marouis Tseno- iIk-Iuco,"! on the 1st of August that there were no Chinese troops in Tonquin, whereupon Challemel Laeour, then French Minister of Foreign Affairs, replied that there was consequently no danger of a conflict. II tiie Chinese forces aimroached the fortresses against which the Fiench were advancing they would run the risk of being considered Anamite auxiliaries. Since then, added Ferry, the situation re mained unchanged by our acts. Our plan of the camoai-'ll is not modified, nnd can. not be modified. It is not with us that theesponsibility for a conflict will rest. Active negotiations between Marouis Tseng and Ferry have been suspended since the latter's note of November oOth.

Lord Lome de. livered a long lecture. here last evening upon uanada and the salubrity oi tne cli mate, and said the fevers which were too common in the United States, were un known within the boundaries of the Do minion. He lauded Canada as a field for emigration, and expatiated upon the mar velous progress by tho various towns. Ixird Lome concluded bv savins that the Canadian people were thoroughly devoted to their connection with the mother Court- try, otherwise they would long ago have discarded their allegiance, of which they are proud. With the Dominion of Canada and the A ustralian colonies in close rela tions, England need never fear her proud position would be shalceu or questioned.

Craig, president ol the txcliantre Bank, and feel ing is tuuitod completely jroin the groftt defaulter to the directors, who allowed him to escape, and some of whom are alleged to be at least privy to his de linquency. The condition of the huk is considered far below that represented by the statements yesterday, and some men consider that it will be double the liability paid up, and there will still be adt-li: iency of twenty-five or thirty per cent, toward liquidating the liabilities. Depoitors and other creditors and shareholdcio are or ganizing to resist the directors being ap pointed liquidators, as they are elected by their own votes.

FIELD TRIALS. Menspbla Setters. Oath and Kne, to Con tend for First Money To-Day. ' Fine Field for tbe Derty-Sew OIBeers of the Kennel Clnb. Yesterday was the third dav of tbe Field Trials at Orand Junction. The con test was for the All-Age Stakes. This stake has been open for contest during the past three days, and is now confined to two Memphis dogs, and the last trial for it will be run this morning. Then will come the Derby Stakes, and after that the Champion Stakes, to be contended for by the first class prize winners. There is a good attendance of first-class dog-fanciers. The judges are three of the most competent Capt. Jarvis, of New Hampshire; Patrick Henry, of Clarksville, and Capt. W. H. Key, of Florence, Ala. Among the dog-fanciers well known to the country are Charles Lincoln, Detroit, Mich. ; J. R. Hendrix and T. K. Slavton, of Pittsburg; J. Palmer O'Neill, Pittsburg, and C. B. Whitford, of the .American Field, one of the best posted dog-fanciers in tbe country. Mr. Hendrix and Mr. M. D. Walters, of Indianapolis, have your re porter's thanks for favors in making his investigations. Mr. Lincoln left last night for New Orleans, where he will superin tend the bench show whicn commences there on the 18th instant. He stated that tiladstone and Oath would be sent to that show. Mr. Short, who has been so successfully handling the Memphis dogs, is a prominent figure among the dog-fanciers. Although named Short, he is considerably over six feet high. His successes certainly mark him as one of the most competent trainers in the eountry. He was in nearly all the heats yesterday, and in the last one handled both Sue and Gath. These two were taken up at night, without deciding the final heat for the All-Age Stakes, which will be finished. It is now a sure thing that a Memphis dog will have first money, and many think that both first and second will be taken here. After the All-Age Stakes have been decided, the trial will commence for the Derby. The entries are numerous, and a splendid show of hunting is predicted by the knowing ones. An election for officers of the National Kennel Club, held at Grand Junction on Tuesday night, resulted as follows : President J. Palmer O'Neill, Pittsburg. First Vice-President J. H. Trezevent, New Orleans. Second Vice-President W. B. Gates, Memphis. secretary and Ireasurer U. Bryson, Memphis. Mr. J. 11. Hendricks has with him one of the best bred animals in the country Queen Laverack, by Tory, one of the most famous English dogs. She goes to the New Orleans bench show. Yesterday being a dark day, the hunters claimed it would lie a good day for hunt ing, as the scent of game would be strong. The birds, however, were scarce, some of the trials were long, and all very close. yesterday's trials. The first was between Loudon, owned by II. P. Harrison, of Canada, and Carrie J., owned by W. B. Gates, of Memphis. Carrie J. discovered a covey, but Loudon, coining up, flushed them. The sedge grass was again drawn, and Loudon pointed. Carrie J. soon pointed short, flushed, and the bird was killed. Both dogs then secured a point. Loudon then Hushed a single bird. .Loudon Boon pointed, and Carrie then flushed. A cotton-field was then drawn, and Loudon was declared winner of the heat.
