Over 600 refugees have passed into the city during the past five days from that section, fearing for their lives dur ing the fights between the soldiers and the insurgents. Nearly all the Havana volunteers have gone to the front, but as fast as they rout the guerrillas in one place they enoounter them in another, mak inga succession of running fights, all within 5 or 10 miles of the city.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Both houses of congress assembled at noon. Almost immediately the president's message •was read. It proved to be a very vol uminous document, about 17,000 words. The opening sentences refer to the late election. "As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their govern ment," the president says, "you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suf frage, without disturbance to our tran quility or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. "When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have suc ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dis position which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws ettah faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serius apprecia tion of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites." The Cuban Question. The most interesting as well as most important portion of the message is that which deals with foreign affairs. The Venezuelan boundary question, the President says, has ceased to be a matter

It is difficult to per ceive that any progress has thus far been made towards the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland coun try. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, character and resource, and are none the less in flexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the object for which they took up arms. Mean time the country is being ruined indus trially and commercially. Spain, the president says, should grant real auton omy which, he belieyes would bo satis factory to the majority of the insur gents. In concluding the subject he says: A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty cr even an undue stimulation and ill timed expression of foeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the con gress that a time may arrive when a corroct policy and care for our interests as well as a regard for the interests of nations and their citizens joined by considerations of humanity and a de sire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related »to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our government to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved, and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to 4 the blessings of peace. v '.•+*? -v- ,A-,r' i .* W

Hi regard to the Union and Central Pacific railroad defaults the president says that unless something is done prior to Jan. 1, he deems it to the best inter* est of the country to begin foreclosure proceedings. The retirement of greenbacks is again urged because of the danger to the gold reserve. The various departmental reports are given brief mention and reeommenda tiom. Civil service is commended and th* good work of the interstate com merce commission noticed. The message closes with an appeal for economy in expenditure.

OLNEY IN CUBA. Supplementary Report to Congress by the Secretary of State. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—For the first time within the memory of old officials, the secretary of state has made a regu lar report to the president, for trans mission to congress, like the reports of other officers of the cabinet. This re port was laid before congress as an ap pendix to the president's message. It treats of many details of our relations during the past year with foreign gov ernments that either were not touched upon in the message or were more NEW 

STORE! NEW 3rOODS! Bran and Feed Always on Hand.-:-: Thompson Street, First Door T%T. "O" ATT South of Patrons Exchange. III# JLLAAAJJUS briefly treated. Under the head of Spain, Secretary Olney has much to say in regard to Cuba, and in his report he sets out in great detail the history of the growth of the rebellion, the present evil state of affairs on the island and other facts upon which the president bases his broad statements and conclusion. No reference is made to a report from Con sul General Lee, but the secretary in timates that this information comes principally from the United Statos con suls, and so must be regarded as con fidential as to its source. The secre tary's estimate of the present situation, is disclosed in the following paragraph, made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the industrial re sources of Cuba: "From whatever point of view we regard the matter, it is impossible not to discern th at a state of things exists at oar doors alike dangerous to good re lations, destructive of legitimate com merce, fatal to the internal resources of Cuba, and most vexatious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its domestic ad ministration, and in its outward rela tions. This situation cannot indefin itely continue without growing still worse, and the time may not be far dis tant when the United States mast se riously consider whether its rights and interests, as well as its international duties in view of its peculiar relations to the island do not call for some decidcd change in the policy hitherto pursued."
