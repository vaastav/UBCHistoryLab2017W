THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE A SYXOPSIS EMBRACING THE SALI- ENT POINTS. 'mportnnt Mutters DiNcnsoed and Rccoiumcudntionit MadeThe VVU Non Hill EndorsedThe Hawaiian Matter WillUe the Subject of a Special Mesxnge. Washington, Dec. 4.President Cleveland's annual message, which was read in con fess soon after that body convened at noon for Its fifty-third regular session, is as follows: 'io the Congress of "the raited States The const it nil Mint duty which requires tht president from time to time to Rive the con gress information of the state of the I'tiion and recommend to tneir consideration .uch matters as he shall judge necessary is fit tingly entered upon by commending to the coujrress 0 careful examination of the detailed statements and well-supported rec ommendations contained In the reports of the heads of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. In an effort to abridge this communication as mnch as is consistent with Its purpose, I shall supplement a brief icference to the contents of these depait mental reports by the mention of such executive business and Incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommend tions as appear to be at this particular time appropilate. While om- foreign relation* have not at all times during the pasjt vear been entirely free from perplexity, no embairasslcg situ ations remain that will not yield to the spir it of fairness and love which eharacteii^e a tngta American foreign policy. 0he outbieak in Brazil the president says* Ihe struggle is between the estab lished government, which controls the nia fhineiy of admliustiation. and with which we maintain fiiendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the A essels of their command In an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration. I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim rec ognition as bellgerents Thus far the posi tion of our government has been that of an attentive but impartial obseiver of the un fortunate conflict. The questions: affecting our relations with Great Biitain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Nego tilt ions are in progress between the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the an ard and regulations agreed upon by the Bering sea tribunal of arbitration practi eallv effective, and it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this conntry for the accomplishment of that purpose The dispute growing out of the docunentaiy tolls impo&ed in the Wellnnd canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States was adjusted by the substitu tion of a moio equitable schedule of charges, and my piedecessor theienpon sus pended his proclamation imposing discrim inating to'ls upon Biitish transit through our canals A request for additions to the list of extraditable offences coveied by the existing tieat between the two countries is under consideration A peci.il Hawaiian Message. It Is hatdly neocbsaiy for me to htate that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused seiious em baiiabsmeut. Just piioi to the installment of the pres ent udminlsti.ulon the existing government of Ha\\ti. had been suddenly overthiown and a ue.ity of annexation had been ne gotiated between the provisional govern ment of the Islands and the United States and submitted to the senate for latification This treaty I uithdiew foi examination, and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis b'ouor to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions beaiing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examina tion Mr Blount submitted to me his le poit, showing bevond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had heen buhvcited with the active aid of our representative to that government and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an aimed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that pmpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed, it seemed to me the onj honorable course for our govern ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been been done by those representing us, and to restore ns far a practicable the tatus existing at the time of our forcible intervention With a view of accomplish ing this result within the constitutional limit of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and lesponslbilities grow ing out of finv chunged condition biought about by our unjustlliahlc interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received ippropilate Instuotlons to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received When received they will be promptly sent to congress, together with all other inf ox mu tton at hand, accompanied bv a special ex ecutive message fully detailing all the facts necessiry to a complete understanding of the eW, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the piesent situation.^ The Treasury Department.

Dur i ng the calendar year 1892, the production of precious metals In the United States was estimated to be 1.596,375 fine ounces of gold tof the commercial and coinage value of $33 I 000,00, and 58,000,000, fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,750 000, and of the coinage value of $74,989.- 800. It Is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1,213,559,169. of which $597.1 697,085 was gold and $615,861,484 was sil ver. One hundred and n'-/tee national banks were organized durl the year ended Oct. 31. 1893. with a cap .al of $11,230,000. Forty-six went Into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the sus pended banks were Insolvent, eighty-six re sumed business and seven remained in the hands of bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new banks or- d| ganized forty-fqur were located in the East ern states, forty-one west of the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the Central and Southern states. The total number of na tional banks in existence on the 31st day of October, 1893, was 3,796. having an ag gregate capital of $695,558,120. The net in crease in the circulation of these banks dux lug the year was $.10,886^972. Silver Purchase Repeal. The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our mone tary scheme has made an entire change iu the complexion of our currency affairs, and 1 do not doubt that the idtlmate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it Is impossible to know at this time pre cisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supplement ary legislation may in the light of such conditions, appear to be essential or ex pedient. Of course, after the recent finan cial perturbation, time is necessary for the establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this restored con fidence the money which has been fright ened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the sit uation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every require ment of our increasing population and of business. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting .\nd concprehensive financial plan. In these ciieumstances I am convinced that a rea per able delay in dealing with this subject, instead Of being injurious, will Increase the piol abilities of wise action. Postofflee Department. The report of the postmaster general con tains a detailed statement of the operations of the postoflice department during the last fiscal year, and much Interesting informa tion touching this important branch of t'he public service. Th-it there was a- larger dis crepancy than usual between the postoflice receipts and expenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessors that the deficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be a little over $1,WXJ.000. It amounted, however, to a little over $6,000,- 000. At the same time, and under the in fluence of like anticipations, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $872,245.71 but now, In view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the cur rent fiscal year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that, at its dose, instead of a surplus There Will a. Deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The postofflee receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $75.M)6.- 933 16 and its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This postofflee deficiency would disappear, or be immeu!el decreased if less matter was cariied free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of postoffices in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893, was 6S.403, an increase of 1.2S4 over the preceding year. Of these 3,360 were presi dential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding yea'-, rorty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, making a total of 610 cities June 30, 1893 Ninetv-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service un der the lnw, but it has no yet been ac corded them on account of insufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. The railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all of fices, but it is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and wav places in the service on an equality in that regard with the Larger and terminal offices This branch of the postal service has, therefore, leceived much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it is gratifving to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to agree with the postmaster general that there is room for its further improvement The Navy Department. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his department during the past year and ex hibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which had been made In the construction of ves sels and makes a number of recommenda tions to which attention is specially in vited During the past six months the de mands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions, calling for vessels to protect Ameri can interests in Nicaragua, Gautemala, Costa Rica. Honduras, Argentina and Bra zil, while the condition of affairs'in Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships With all these calls upon our navy it became necessary, in or der to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering sea under the modus vlvendl agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel from the fish ni sio and three from the revenue ma 1 in The following vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready for service The double turreted coast de fense monitor Miantonomoh, the double turreted const defense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the pro tected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Phila delphia. Newark, San Francisco, Chai'les ton. Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser De troit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington Machias Castine and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat Vesusivius Of these the Bancroft, Ma chias, Detroit and Castine have been placed in commission during the current calendar year The following vessels are in progress of construction: The second-class battleships Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marble head and the coast defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrlte and Monadnock, all of which will be completed within one year: the harbor defense ram Katahdln and the protected cruisers Co lumbia, Minneapolis, Olympia, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will be completed prior to July 1, 1895 the first-class battle ships Iowa. Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be completed Feb. 1, 1896. and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed Aug. 1 of that year. It is also expected that the three gunboats authorized by the last congress will be completed in less than two years. Immigration. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, re ports that during the last fiscal year there ariived at our ports 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1,063 were not permitted to land under the limitations of the law, and 577 were returned to the countries from which thev came by reason of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 141 034 less than for the previous vear. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and th strated danger of the5 introductione odemon- con tagious diseases from foreign ports has in vested the subject of national quarantine with increased interest. A more general and harmonious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere and constantly operating by preventive* means to shield our country from the in vasion of disease and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, -would, I believe, add great'y to the safety of our people. Sea Coast Defenses. It is gratifying to note that we have be gun to attain complex results in the com prehensive scheme of sea coast defenses and fortification entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been expended, but the cost of maintenance will be Inconsider able as compared with the expense of con struction and ordnance and at the end of the current calendar year, the war depart ment will have nine 12-inch guns, twenty 10-inch and thirty-four 8-inch guns ready to be mounted on gun lifts and carriages and seventy-five 12-inch mortars. The manufacture of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, but to render these guns available for the purposes they are designed to meet emplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made in this direction and It is desirable that congress by adequate appropriations should provide lor the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work. Abolish the Fee System. The report of the attorney general con tains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the departing it of justice for the past vear, together with certain recom mendations as to needed legislation on vari ous subjects. cannot too heartily Indorse the proposition that the fee system, as applicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States commissioners, should be abolished with as little delay as possible. I Is clearly la the interest 0 the community that the business of the courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as Inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice win allow. The system is, therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execution of the law and private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous to the rights and free dom of the citizens, an Irresistible'tempta tion to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. I also heartily -loin the attorney general In recommending legislation fixing degrees 01 federal jurisdiction, as has been done In many of the states, authorizing writs of error on behalf of the government In cases where final judgment Is rendered against the sufficiency ot an Indictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial limiting the right of review in cases,,of felony punish able only by fine and imprisonment to the circuit court of appeals," and making speedy provision for the construction of such pris ons and reformatories as may be necessary for the confinement of United States con victs. Agriculture. The report of the secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly interesting, es pecially to that large part of our citizens intimately coucerned In the agricultural oc cupation. On the 7th day of March, 1893, there was upon its pay roils 2,430 employes. This number has beeen reduced to 1,850 per sons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the Imperative demand of people for economy in the administration of their gov ernment, the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the elimination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs "of the department. During the first quarter of the present year the ex penses of the department aggregated $345,- 976.76, as against $402,021.42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1893. The secretary makes appar ent his intention to continue this rate of re duction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,280 than those for the present year. The amount of the appropriation for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is $856,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is $700,000. The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been en forced during the last year, and the large stock yard*} of the country have been kept free from infection. The total number of Inspections of cattle for export during the past fiscal year was 611,542. The exports show a falling off of about 25 per cent from the preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an Increase in the price of American export cattle during the year ending June 30, 1893. Exports of inspected pork aggregated 20,- 677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being 665,490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,308,695 pounds. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1892, attained the enormous fig ure of $S00,000,000 in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but, nevertheless, reached $615,- 000,000, being 75 1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination, will show that in al most every line the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total expoxts aggx-egated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britian took considerably over $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds, our total expoits were $28,000,000, of which Great Britian took $24,000,000 Of pork products the total exports were $84,000,000, of which Great Britian took $53,000,000 In bread stuffs, cotton and minor products of like proportions sent to the same desti nation are shown. In the year 1839 the congress appropri ated $1,000, to be taken from the patent oflice funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing rai-e and improved varie ties of seeds and for prosecuting agricult ural investigations and procuring agricult ural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of ag riculture has grown to its present unwieldy and unjustifiable extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $66,548.61 The remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was ex pended in putting them up and distributing them. In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with aud test new varieties of seeds, and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dis tribution by legislation and legislator con tinues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representa tives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Civil Service Reform, The continued intelligent execution of thtv, civil service law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent evtension of its limitation and regulations to the em ployes at the free delivery postoflices, which has been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission by the hearty co-operation of the postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the use fulness of the system. I am, if possible, more than ever con vinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law, not only in its effect upon the public service, but also, what is even more impoitant, in its effect in elevating the tone of political life gen erally. Since 1880 congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more ves sels, and the secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated in building up a thor ough and efficient navy, I can not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take into account the num ber of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our treasury in considering the propriety of an appropria tion at this time to begin new work. The Pension Bureau. On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an in crease of 89,944 over the number on the x-olls June 30, 1S92. Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolu tionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3.S82 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the War of the Re belllion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pen sioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which include also pensions on account of death and disabilities not chargeable to army service, was 459,555. The number added to the rolls during the y.ear was 123,- 634, and the number dropped was 33 690 The first payments on pensions allowed dur ing the year amounted to $33,576,549.98 This includes arrears or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of the pension dates and the time of act ually granting the certificate. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disa bilities now related to military service vet as a requisite totatiQSs it benefit a disability $w VhtlnJ?AJn^apac i applicants "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support." The execution of this law In Its early stages does not seem to have been In accord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute, and since that time this con struction has been followed. This has had the effect of limiting the operations of the law to its Intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the com mission suspended payments upon a num ber of pensions which seem to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete exami nation, giving notice to the pensioners in order that they might hare an opnortunitv to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims, notwithsanding apparent invallditv I am unable to understand why frauds to the pension rolls should not be exposed aud corrected with thoroughn.s3 and vior Ev ery name fraudulently put unon these' rolls is a wicked Imposition upon the kbidlv sen timent In which pensions have their orten. /The Indians.

Tariff Reform Economy in public -xpendlture is a duty tnat cannot innocently be neglected by those entrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses, it must be confessed that our appa^entlv endless resources, the familiarity of onr people with immense accumul itions of wealth the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should some manner be to their immedi ate and personal advantage the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountability nave led to growing extravagance in gov ernmental appropriations. The duty of public economv is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand 01 providing revenue to meet government expenditure and yet reducing the people's burden of erate taxation. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. !Nothing so claims our attenf tiou so clearly presents itsel as both an opportunity and a dutyan op portunity to observe the gratitude of our teuow citizens, a duty imposed upon our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandatoef of the people. Aiter full discussion,w ouk countrymen have spoken in faror this reform, and they have con- ?u accomplishmenus tby it eT ho,fe the hands of those who are solemnly pledged If there Is anything in the theory of a rep resentation in public places of the people and their desires, If public officers are really the servantfailuretheo of people, anrelieff i political promisesu and professions have any binding f01 ce 9 give the SO long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should interfere to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform is ac complished by wise and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should DC limited by strict economy, we cannob close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us in which justice and fairness call for discriminating caie the distnbution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to aid the people flirectiy through tariff re form one of the most obviouq features should be a induction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life The benefits of such a reduction would be pal pable and substantial, seen and felt bv the thousands who would be better fed and bet ter clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willinsr benefactions of a gov ernment whose higher function is the mo motion of the people. Nob less closely re lated to our people's prosperity and well being is the removal of the restrictions upon the importation of the raw materials necessaiy to our manufacturers. The world would be open to our ingenuitv and enterprise. This cannot be while fedral legislation through the imposition of high tariff foibids to Amex-ican manufacturers as Cheap material as those used bj their compe titors It is quite obvious that the enhance ment of the price of our manufactured pro ducts lesulting from this policy not only confines the market for these products with in our own borders to the direct disadvan tage of our manufacturers, but also in creases their cost to our citizens. The inter ests of i&hor are certainly, though indirect ly, involved in this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods, soon fill the narrow market to which tney are con fined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories a discharge of employes and distress in the homes of our working men Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good, that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw material and low tariff, does the intelligence of our worlcingmen lead them quickly to discover that their steady employment permitted by free raw material is the most important factor In their relation to tariff legislation. A measure li.w *^fl prepared by the ap propilate congressional committee enioUly mg taxiff reform on the kues .lerem sug getod which will be promDtlv submitted for legislative action It is "the resx.lt of much patriotic anyd unselfish and believe1 it deals with its subiect as consist- thoroxgbl as existinwork, conditionI ^PJ permit. I am satisfied that he '-ed-icd tar iff duty provided for in the proposed legis lation added to the existing -nteraal reve nue taxation, will jn the near fuure, hough, perhaps, not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of th government. The committee, after full con sideration, and to provide against a tempo rarv deflciencv which may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely em braced in their plan a few additional in ternal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corpo rate investments. The new assessments are not only abso lutelv just and easily borne, but thev have the furtherment of being such as can be re mitted without unfavorable disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that if success can only be attained bv means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff leform. and as a result of their willingness to subordi nate personal desires and ambitions to tht general good. The local Interest affected bv the proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must in evitably fail. In conslugion my Intense feeling of re sponsibility Impels me to invoke for the manifold Interests of a generous and con fiding people the most scrupulous care and to oledge my willing support to every legis lative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country 

GROVBR CrJBlVEIiAND. Executive Mansion, Washington, D. Dec. 4, 1893. Mules A vera ere Higher in Every Statein the Union Except Oregon. If nobility mav be estimated in dollars, the mule is a nobler animal than the horse, says the New York Sun. Yet there are no autumnal mule shows, and even if there were it is hardly probable that flower adorned young women would make a prac tice of patting the prize animal. The onlv way to pat a mule, according to the Texas code, Is with a nee rail or a board. The man who collected horse and mule statistics for the census report shows that the average price of a mule is $7 more than the average price of a horse. The ordinary mule in South Carolina, which owns about 55,000 of the long-eared beasts, Is worth about $90 the average price of a horse In the same state Is about $79. Texas probably has more mules (about 200,000) than any other state. The average price Is about $41, or nearly twice the value of a Texas horse. In Missouri mules are worth about $7 more and in Kentucky about $3 more than horses. Only a few states have no mules, or so few that the statistician didn't make a note of them. One of these states is Rhode Island, which the mule driver of Texas doubtless would think is not any too large a pastur age and play ground for a festive mule of Southern birth. Oregon Is the only state where horses brlag higher prices than mules. The Ordinary mule out there is worth $46 and the horse $51. The figures for alCallfornla are: Mules, $67 horses, $46. In Pennsylvania, where mules, famous for longevity, are much used in the mines, they bring about $86 horses, $67. In this state there are seventy times as many horses as there are mules, which number about 14,000. A New York mule is worth $91 and a horse $76". Mules are prized more in New Jersey than in any other state, the average price being about $106, or $30 more than horses. Illinois has about 140,000 mules, or more than any other Western state.
