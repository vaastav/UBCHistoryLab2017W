I bava received nine letter* in regard to it?two in favor (your* bein,* one), six aga list, and one which left mo in dom-L as to the position of thu writer. Second, lt is well known thal there are differences of opinion in r. fer euee to the primary, many goo men prefer ri ag tbe convention, but it may, for the purposes of this let ter, be oonaidered as settled that the Democratic part* favors the primary plan nf tnak ing nominations I cannot, however, agree ?with you that tho pri marj as it i gist* is not protected by law. On the contrary, the law provides that "all laws in? tended to seen rc the reg U ls i Hy and purity of | cneral and local elections and to present and punish any cor? rupt practices in connection there? with, and the penalties and punish? ments ow or hereafter prescribed hy law for such offenses shall, si far ns they may ba applicable,applj to all primary elections, whether the same be held under any statutf law of this State or under a plau provided by sonic political party." lt can be readily seen that thi-: law gives to the primary the pro tection it alfords to general elect ions, but your view is that this law j having recently been declared ud constitutional, there is no law ti punish frauds by election officer: in a primary election. It is trui that upon a demurrer to an indict inent chargintr eleet'on officers ii tiie first primary for Congress thi: year in the Second District, tha the judge of tbe Corporation Cour I ot Norfolk held theact quoted abo* unconstitutional, sustained tho dc murrer of the accused, and dismiss ed the caso.

I ha* great res pe t for these j.idges; the are mun of high character, and wo! equipped for the duties of the odie they hold, and I know they rendel ' ed their decisions from a sense i ? public duty, but I am just as sur that ihey were mistaken in thei judgment, and that the law is coi stitutional. This conclusion is fully justifie by the case of Commonwealth again*' Jackson Wiso, judgo ina priu ar 1 election, who was indicted in th s Hustings Court of the city of Rici ,1 mond, on the 21st of Decombei ti 1.105, under the general law, tb g* same under which the Norfolk elm d liar "Ve rs were indicted.

FISHER. Artist. CHERE may hs forty cardinal points of beauty, but to me ONE WORD SUMS THEM ALI. DP? HARMONY. I don't believe in any fixetl rules of beaut*,. YOU CANT MEASURE BEAUTY WITH A TAPE MEASURE OR A I FOOTRULE. A WOMAN'S FEATURES SHOULD HARMONIZE. This idea that to be beautiful s nose must Ix* just so long or s : mouth so trida seems to me utter nonsense. What is right for one typo of woman is wrong for another. I like a face that is fine anti strong as well as beautiful?a girl with a brain and B heart, an expression of latent energy and power that shows if life makes any unusual demand upon her she will be ' able to meet it.

As you base your letter largely upon tba decisions of the .Norfolk judges, which is directly opposed I to tho decision of the Supre Court. I might stop hero and be justified in my posltioa. But 1 think it but fair to the people of the Second District and to tho ollieors charged with the management of tho partv holding the primary, to -?tate that upon complaint of fraud, tiie charges were at once investi 1. a new primary ordered and held, and a result reached which is free from all taint or charge of fraud so far as I am informed. Third, leooking at the requeel in your hiter from tho stand point of the S:ate, I beg to remind you thal if a special session of the Legisla? ture should now be called, one of its most important duties would be to ii eel a sviccessor to Senator Daniel and mi deprive tbe people of the Slate In.in deciiiing by primary who that successor would be, and so dk feat '.he declared policy of the State in reapeot to the choice of United States Soators Fo nh.

ENGLAND FIRST USED IHE M'ADAM ROAD Former American Citizen Mana? ger of the System GAVE ENTIRE SATISFACTION Began in England Early in Nine? teenth Century Thu \'n?*ric*an edition of Cham* '?cr's !>i.'\ 'upacdi ?. gi Tea ;i full ac? count r hov and when the govern? ment of Ci-eat Britain obteioad trood roads, designated "m:icadamiz?*d roads." which are being built so largely in Kockbndge and other counties in the Stite. Tbe account says : John Loudon M.ic A dam was born ip Scotlaad in i7ot>. and passed his youth in the United States. On his return he was appointed rnanagerof i district of roads in Ayrshire, and origina'el and succeasfully prac? ticed Ihe K\atem of road-making now known I y bis name. In lbl!< he was summoned to Bagland aud rpm. appoiated by i'arlit-inent to su periatead the roads in the Bristol ilistrict, which were in a most de? plorable cjndition. In 1S27 he was appointed geueral surveyor of the Met ropol ilea roads, and in re**a**d of his exertions to render them elli cient received a grant 100,000 pounds from the government. His system rapidly became genera! throughout Kngland, and was also introduced into France with great success. M.'Adam died at MotTat. in Dumfriesshire, in 1836. Tho principles of his bys! which is known as macadam:zing, areas follows: For the foundation of a road it is not necessary to lay a substratum or large stones, pave? ment, etc., as it isa matter of ind f ference whether the substratum be hard or soft; and if any preference is due it is to the latter. The metal for roads mui"t consist of broken stones (granite, flint, or whinstone is by far tlie best). These mu**t in no ca^e exceed six ounces each in weight, and stones of from ono two ounces are to be preferred The large stones in tho road aro tc bo loosened and removed to the side. where they are to bc broken inti pieces of the regulation weight, ann the road is then tobo -smoothed with a rake so thal ihe earth may settle down into the holes from which the larger stones were removed. Tho broken metal is then to be carefully spread over it. and -s tbis operation is of great importance to the future quality of the road, tho meta! is not to be laid on in shovel fulls to the requisite depth of Prom six to ter inches, but to be scattered in s'.i"*v elfull after shovelful till a depta o from six io ten inches, according ti the quality of the road, has been ob tained. Tba road is to have a fa! from the middle to the sides abou one foot in sixty, and ditches are ti be dug on the He'd sn'eof the fence to a depth of a fe * t-iches below thi level of the road." Assistant Attorney General Dead Assistant Attorney-General Wil liam E> Bibb died at his drove ave nue residence iu Richmond Satin day morning at 6 o'clock, in hi sixty-fifth year, as the result of in juries received when he fell dow stairs at his homo sumo days agt and a later operation for arothe disorder.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PARCELS POST Recommended by President Taft in His Message The establishment cf tho parcels post, is being discussed throughout the country, acd first imp' tus was given to the question by President Taft's recommendation of its ?stib li sh ment on all rural routos. The laltimoro News reoeatly ha"! the following lo say regarding tbis sub? ject: '?Postmaster f'*?rera; HitchcocV **.ili ask thu* C -tigress, a' ihj forth* ooining short session, mike an ap? propriation to covwr the cost of an inquiry into the nature and volume of business t at would be h-indled by a parcels post system should it be established in this country. Ho j will also ask that Congress author? ize the delivery on rural routes of 1 parcels weighing xs high as eleven pounds, which is the weight limit 1 of the international parcel? post. ! He points o-.it that this limited ser [ vice can be instituted at a small ad | ditional cost, since the rural car ; riers already have the necessary equipment in the way of horses and wagons. The successful operations of these experimental lines would : undoubtedly lead to an extension of ' the system. "One by one th* arguments at*; 'nst the parcels post have been proved fallacious. The very inter? ests which have objected to it most, would be first to feel the benefit*--, ar-tl the system is growing in favor every day. The appropriation asked by the toastmaster General should bo rn..de by Congress. The data tims collected would thro* valuable light upon the practical poasi bili ties of the parcels pos- in this country. If the people of Mary? land are in favor of this extension of the service, tbey should brin.i t'.eir influence to bear upon their representatives in Congress to sup? port it. Such a course, followed by . he people ot the entire country, would bring prompt notion in placa i of the vexatious delay which has marked thc movement so far. Tho ijro * th of independence in politics j strengthens the tendency to hold our representatives in Congress I directly accountable fir carrying out the popular wishes,among whit.-!', is the establishment of the parcels ' post." The Job Session Tho last session of Congress has won the title of the "job" session oecause it is held after the election when many Congressmen have been repudiated at the poils and when sven thee who have been re-elect? ed (eel less restraint because of the time that must elapse before anoth? er election. Every careful observ? er of congressional proceedings has noticed the tendency on the part of ? those in chalga of questionable ' j legislation to postpone action until ? the last session, and that teudeucy j is even more marked when a party i is going out of power. The Demo? crats and Progressive Republicans must be on their guard during the session that convenes in December. The special interests, seeing that they will not bi) able to control tbe n xt Congress, will do their utmost to realize on the investment that 8 they made in the present Congress.
