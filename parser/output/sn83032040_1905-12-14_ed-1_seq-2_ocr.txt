Praising 'he genuine love of nature which exists in the hearts of so many quiet people, who have a real delight in the silent and exquisite changes, the influx and efllux of life which we tall the seasons, an anonymous Eng- , lish writer says: "Those who are fortunate enough to spend their lives in the quiet country-side have much of this tranquil and nnuttered love of nature; and others, again, who are condemned by circumstances to spend ] tlieir days in toilsome towns, and yet have the instinct, derived perhaps from long generations of country fore fathers. feel this beauty, in the short weeks when they are enabled to ap proach it. more poignantly still. The fact remains, however, that a love of natuie is a part of the panoply of culti vation which at the present time peo ple above a certain social standing feel bound to assume. Very few ordinary persons would care to avow that they took no interest in national politics, in games and sports in literature, in appreciation of nature, or in religion. 1 As a matter of fa'-i. the vital interest that is taken in these subjects, per haps in games and sports, is far below the interest that is expressed in them. A person who said frankly that he thought that any of these subjects were uninteresting, tiresome or absurd, would be thought stupid or affected, j even brutal. Probably most of the people who express a deep concern for these things believe that they aie giv ing utterance to a sincere feeling; but, not to expatiate on the emotions which they mistake for rea! emotion in the other departments, there are probably a good many people who mistake for a love of nature the pleasure of fresh air, physical movement, and change of scene. Many worthy golfers, for in stance. who do not know that they are talking insincerely, attribute, in con versation. the pleasure they feel in pursuing their game to the agreeable surroundings in which it is pursued; but my secret belief is that they pay more attention to the lie of the little white ball, and to the character of bunkers, than to the pageantry of sea and sky." Trot Out the "Tumblers." It appears that x leading society woman of New York, one of the front rankers in the extended Four Hun dred, has decreed that large diamonds must be worn this season, instead of small ones. Every little while it is necessary for some one prominent in the upper circles to recall the society clan to a sense of its duty to itself and an admiring public. It is so easy to get careless about one's diamonds. Perhaps a cluster of little dazzlers may have a more easily inserted pin than the solitaires at the bottom of thf casket. And then, again, suggests the Clveland Plain Dealer, these society women are apt to seize the firsjt gems that come to hand, regardless of their comparative value. A necklace of stones as large as marrowfat peas may clasp more ea. ly perhaps than the ordinary moth-ball pattern, but no society woman with a proper pride should permit horsed i<» employ any such excuse for her neglect of the politer usages of ihe Newport set. Bring out the big diamonds, then, and hang em where they may be seen of all nii n. Let th< little stones rattle hark in the can.

REPUBLICANS STAND SOLID Talk of a Split in the Ranks of the Party Is All Balder dash. It is safe to disregard the story from Washington that the republicans in congress will split over the question of railway rate regulation. A division of opin.on exists now among the repub lican members of the senate, interstate commerce committee, but there are ev idences that this will practically or ac tually disappear by the time that, con gress meets, says the St. Louis Globe- Democrat. Chairman Elkins of that committee denies that he is opposed to the principle of the president's plan. Ho says he differs with the president only on details, and the details, of course, are something which will have to be arranged in congress. The presi dent has nothing to do with the mi nute provisions of the regulation scheme. In his forthcoming message he will urge the enactment of a lav/ which will give certain powers in the regulation of rates to the interstate commerce commission or to some other board belonging to the general government, but congress, if it agrees with the scheme, will frame the meas ure. From present indications a majority of the republican members of the sen ate interstate commerce committee will be on the president's side by the opening of congress. Cullom of Illi nois and Doiliver of lowa have been with the president from the beginning. Millard of Nebraska, who is counted as doubtful, is also with the president. Several times in the past ew months he has made his attitude ..lain to the country. There is now a reasonable chance that Elkins will side with the administration by the time the bill is framed which will present the matter to the senate. Foraker's friends say there is no irrepressible conflict be tween him and the president on tit rate issue, which means that they be lieve Foraker will be over on the presi dent's side by the time the subject com?s up in congress. Kean of New Jersey, who is a new man in the sets ate, and who has been placed among the opponents of the president's poli cy, is reported to lie swinging over to the administration. The division among the republicans of the senate interstate commerce committee will not te serious enough to give the dem ocrats any aid and comfort. At least three facts will prevent a split among the senate republicans on the rate regulation question. The peo ple of the country, by a large majority, favor that policy. A rate-regulation bill will pass the house early in the session, and will receive the votes of three-fourths or more of the repub lican members of that chamber. All the republican leaders of the popular branch, from Cannon down, are in fa vor ol a measure substantially on the lines which the president urges. If the republicans of the senate fail to give rate regulation the support which it needs to carry it through that body the democrats will do the work. These considerations will prevent any serious break among the republican senators on that policy. A regulation bill in come shape is sure to be enacted. The senators who stand out sgiinst that policy will have a hard road to travel if they appeal for reelection. The coun try is resolved to try the experiment of placing a supervision over railway rates in the hands oi some govern ment board, and the people usually accomplish what they set out to do. On the rate regulation question as on ail other important issues th? republican line in congress is likely to remain un broken. Fruits of Protection. The fact is, that under the Dinglcy protective tariff the prosperity of the I'tiit States has exceeded the wild est dreams of (he framers of that law. It has given splendid service to-day in the expansion of our foreign markets anil the conservation of our own. Never in our history have we as a peo ple l.een able to sell so largely abroad o.- to buy so liberally in foreign fields. Never have the people of the I'nited States enjoyed such continuous and increasing prosperity as has prevailed since the protective enactment of ISi'T. Then why score the American stat-. smanship which has made po sl ble ilKse truly marvelous results? — JUunoh< ster t la.) Press. Down Partisan Rankness.

CAMERON COUNTY PRESS, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1905. FALSE ISSUES RAISED. Massachusetts Democrats' Plea for Canadian Reciprocity a Shal low Pretense. Whitney, democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, is a successful millionaire. He has run greac monopolies and knows all about that sort of business, but obviously he has neglected to inform himself on pol itics and especially on reciprocity. Whitney gave out. an interview the other day in which he arrainged the republican party for its failure to in stall reciprocity with Canada, the fa vorite shout of Foss and his ciique, says the Lewiston (Me.) Journal. Sen ator Lodge got after Whitney in a speecn on Saturday and wound up Mr. Whitney, rhetorically speaking, with a weaver's knot. Mr. Lodge showed that under Hlaine. when Harrison was pres ident, effort was made to install recip rocity with Canada, and Canada would listen to no reduction in her duties on manufactured goods. Whitney says that ten years ago when the demo crats were in power, reciprocity was turned down. Certainly it was not 111- stallel and this is an inconvenient fact fo: Whitney. I'nder McKinley, Congressman Dingley and others sat on a joint commission of the Uniled States and Canada to see if a treaty could be developed, for Congressman Dingle> and others thought something could be done on a basis of free coal, but the Canadians rince that time have proved as intractable as they did un der the Harrison administration. In 1903, under Roosevelt, again it was in evidence that the Canadians would al low no reduction on their rates on manufactures entering Canada, anil there has been 110 time in the last dec-ale when any reciprocity that was reciprocal was practicable. Meantime during the last five years American trade with Canada has increased from $100,000,000 to $162,000,000. On the oth-sr hand, the present Dingley tariff has worked so well that. about 02 per cent, of the entire foreign trade of Canada, which amounts to $400,000,000, is her trade with the United States. If we had sought for ideal legislation coul.l we have secured anything more favorable to our interests than the Canadian trade with the United States which has been promoted by the pres ent tariff? Another boomerang was fired by Whitney when he complained that the present conditions were un fortunate for Boston. Mr. Lodge shows that under the present treaty arrange ments Canadian exports come from Canada in bond, duty free when de signed for export beyond this country, and that the foreign trade of Boston from this source has so increased that the Allan line has just decided to run its Glasgow service to Boston. And Mr. Lodge adds that if Mr. Whitney wants to benefit Boston he will do well to Join the republicans in enacting into law such measures as will upbuild American shipping, which for years has been opposed by the democratic members of congress. 

QUIXOTIC QUEST ONLY. Free Hide Pilgrimage That Resolved Itself Into a Ridiculous Farce. There is an element of the ludicrous in the free hides pilgrimage of Novem ber 15. Certainly a new record for absurdity was established when that group of footwear producers left their business for a round trip of 800 miles in order to solicit the impossible. Their errand, says the American Economist, was to persuade the presi dent to help them get free trade in hides. They should have known that the president had no power in the premises. Congress, not the president, fixes tariff rates, ana fixes them for the whole country—not a single state or section. Of this fact they were sharply reminded in the white house. The president has the matter "under consideration." He vili not, of course, make any recommendation regarding hides in his December message. Presi dential messages do not. deal with items in tariff schcd 'les. Still less do they 1•1 ay favorites in detailed tariff recommendations. It if hardly conceivable that the chief executive should resolve himsell into a perpetual ta.'iff hearing. If lu were t< do this, his real executive du ties wi.uld suffer sauly. Afte> - consenting to take up the ques tion of 110 tariff on hides he could not well kfuse to take op the question of more tariff on some other article ol domestic production. If persuaded b> the icctwear industrials to recommend free trade in hides, how could he es cape compliance with the demands ol the farmers for frc trade in leather and ils finished products? Probably the fr*.' hide pilgrim? never thought of ih.'l. It would seem that Ihere are many things which tin Masachuset is "reformers" have not thought of.

FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS CONVENES The Senate Proceedings Were Brief— The House Was in Session for More Than Three Hours. Washington, Dec. 5. —The assem bling yesterday of the members of the Fifty-ninth congress for their first ses sion was marked by no unusual inci dents, but it attracted to the capitol crowds of spectators who took a lively interest in the proceedings. Senators Allison and Morgan were appointed by Vice President Fairbanks as a committee to notify the president that congress was ready to receive any communication he desired to make. The senate was in session only 20 minutes. Senators Aldrich (Ft. I.), Knox (Pennsylvania), Warner (Mo.I and Frazier (Tenn.) took the oath of office and an adjournment was taken as a mark of respect to the late Sena, tor Piatt, of Connecticut. The preliminary steps to organiza tion were taken by the house. Joseph O. Cannon, of Illinois, was re-elected speaker, the members of the house took the oath of office; the officers and tloor employes of the body were re elected: the rules of the last congress were adopted, and members went through the formality of drawing for seats. A committee was appointed to act with the senate committee in notifying President Roosevelt that congress was ready to transact business, the rules committee and the committee on mile age were appointed and the house ad journed after a session which lasted three and a half hours, Ln compliance with resolutions announcing the death of Senator Piatt, of Connecticut, and Representative Marsh, of Illinois. Washington, Dec. <!. —The senate was in session for almost three hours yesterday and gave practically all of its time to listening to the reading of the president's message. Mr. Branda gee took his seat as senator from Connecticut. House. —President Roosevelt's mes sage to congress received the atten tion of the house for two and a half hours yesterday. The house received and ordered re ferred to one of the regular election committees a protest from the Fifth congressional district of Illinois, stat ing that Anthony Michalek, who was on Monday sworn in as a member of the house from that district, is not a citizen of the United States. Upon motion of Mr. Goldfogle, of New York, a resolution was read ex pressing the sympathy of the American people for the distressed Russian Jews. Washington, Dec. 7. —The senate be gan business in earnest yesterday. The session was of only little more than two hours' duration, but in that time several hundred bills and resolutions were introduced and referred to com mittees. House. —With an opportunity for unlimited debate on the subject of the Panama canal, the house exhausted its .oratory on that subject in a session of four and three-quarter hours yester day. Washington, Dec. S.—An appropria tion of $11,000,000 was voted yesterday toward the construction of the Pana ma canal. The bill contains beside the appro priation a provision removing a lax disability against the proposed bonds to be issued for the construction of the canal, thus placing the bonds 011 a footing with other government bonds as available for security for national bank circulation and to reimburse the treasury for the money appropriated in the bill. Senate. —The subject of campaign contributions by insurance companies occupied the major portion of the time of the senate. The resolution directing the secre tary of the treasury to report whether the reports of the national bank exam iners show that the banks have made campaign contributions in recent years was adopted.
