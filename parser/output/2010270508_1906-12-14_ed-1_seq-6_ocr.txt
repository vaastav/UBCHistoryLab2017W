At tho .same time Vandeloup and Merre walked Into the bar at the Wattle IJrco Hotel, Pierre went to his bed, aud Vandeloup. humming a gay song, turned jn his iieel and weut to Ule tli enter, v. i CI1APTKU XIV. tJ llie Wopples family wero true P.ohe dartnns, and hitfl not yet losi their way 1o the pleasant city. They accepted good Knd bad fortune with wonderful oquitniin Ky, and if their pockets were empty one day, there was niwitys a possibility of uiolr wing lull tlie next. v lien tins was. the case they generally celebrated tin event by a little supper, and as their present wasou in Bnllntut bid fair to be a BiKvx'ssful one. Mr. Theodore Wonnles determined to have a convivial evening after the performance was over, That the Wopples family were favorites with the Hallarat folk was amply seen by the crowded house which assembled' to pee "Tlie Cruet Stand." The audience Were very impatient for the1 curtain to rise, as they did not appreciate the over ture, which consisted of aire udaptod for tin violin and piano by All'.

He was 'tll;tle Plt HS WAa on,y natural after puon an adventure as tie nan been vugugeu In, but otherwine teemed all right. He walked up to the first row of tlie stalls and took his m.at Uwlde a young man of about 25, who was evidently nitidi aniusd it tihe performance. . "Hullo, Villler!" Mild this young geu Midas Ham it . tloman, turning round to the new arrival, "what d'ye think of the play?" "Only Just got in," returned Mr. VII iiers, sulkily. "Any good?" "Well, not bad," returned the other; "I've seen it In Melbourne, you know--tlie original, I mean, this is a very hcx'-ond-hand nffair." Just as tlie orchestra were making their final plunge into the finale of the "Wop ples' Waltz,'" M. Vandeloup, cool and calm as usual, tt rolled into Ihe theater, and, seeing a vacant scnflpojidc Villiers, walked over and took it. "Oood evening, m.v friend," he wald, touching Villiers on tlie shoulder. "Hu Joylng tlie play, eh?" Villiers angrily pushed away the I'Yenehnian's hnnd and glareif vindictively at liim. "Ah. you still bear malice for that lit tle episode of the ditch," said Vandeloup, with a gay laugh, "t'ome. now. this is a mistake; hit us be friends. Seen your wife lately?" This apparently careless impiiry caused Mr. Villiers to jump suddenly out of his seat, much to tlie astonishment of his friend J tarty. Altogether "The Cruet Stand" was a success, aud would have a steady run of three nights at least, so Mr. Wopples said. Villiers, Vandeloup and ltarly went out, a ml as none of them felt inclined to go to bed, Villiers told them he knew Mr. Theodore Wopples, and proposed that they should go behind the scenes and see him. This was tinaniinonsly carried, and after some didiculty with tlie doorkeeper, they obtained access to the mysterious regions of the stage, and then' found Master Sheridan Wopples practicing a breakdown while waiting for the rest of tlie family to get ready. lie volunteered to guide them to his father's dressing room, and on knocking at the door Mr. Wopples' voice boomed out "Coiue in," in such an unexpected manner that it made them all jump. Of course, they all expressed themselves delighted, and as the entire Wopples fam ily had already gone to choir hotel, Mr. Wopples with his three guests went, out of the theater and wended their way to wards the same place. They soon arrived at the hotel, and having entered, Mr. Wopples pushed open the door of a room from whence the sound of laughter proceeded, and introduced tho three strangers to Ifis family. The whole ten, together with Mrs. Wopples, were prcsc it, and were seated around a large table plentifully laden with cold beef and pickle.", salads aud other things too nu merous to mention. Mr. WoPliias present ed them first to Ids' wife, a faded, washed out looking lady, with a perpetual simper oil her face, and clad in a lavender mus lin gown with ribbons of the same de scription, she looJu'd. wonderfully light and airy. "This' said Mr. Wopples hi his deep voice, holding his wife's hand as if lie were afraid she would float upward through the wiling like a bubble, "this is my llutterer." Why he called her his llutterer no one ver knew, unless it was because her rib bons were im-cssantly fluttering; but, had he called her his shadow, tlie name would have loeii more appropriate. Mrs. Wop ples fluttered down to the ground in a bow, and then fluttered up again. "(lentlemen," she said, in a thin, clear voice, you are welcome. I Mil you enjoy the performance?" Madame," returned Vandeloup, with a smile, "need you ask that?". shadowy smile floated over Mrs. Wop ples' indistinct features, and then her hus band inlrodiuvd the rest of the family in t bunch. "ticntlemcn," he said, waving Ids hand to the expectant ten, who stood in a line of live male ami five female, "the celebrat ed Wopples family." , Tlie ten all simultaneous! v bowed at this as jf they were worked by machinery. and then every one sat down to supper, Mr. Theodore Wopples tailing the head of the table. All the family seemed to ad mire liim immensely, aiul kept their eyes t listened on his face with aflectionate re gard. When it was nearly twelve o'clock Vandeloup ros to take Ills leave. "Oh, you re not going yet." wild Mr. Wopples, upou which all jhe family echoed, "purely, not jet," in a most hos pitable manner. "I must," said vandeloup, with a smile. "Irk now Madame will excuse inc. wltli a bow to Mrs. Wopples, who there-' iilKin fluttered nervously; "but I have to lie up very early in the morujug." "Iff that en.se," said Mr. Wopples. "ris ing. "I will not detain' you; early to Ited and early to rise, you knowiaiot that I believe in it nut oh myself, but I under stand it is practiced with good remilt by some people." ' 'Oood night, Messrs.

I'll put your name ou the free list," n M. Vandeloup thanked tlie actor warm y for rtiLs kind offer, and took himself off ; aw he passed along tlie street he heard a' burst of laughter from the Wopples fain lly, no doubt caused by some witticism of the head of the clan. h 'walked -slowly home to liw Lotel thinking deeply.

"My !" said this dunnel, when she saw him, "you are a nice young man coming home ut. this hour twelve o'clock. See," tind, as a proof of her assertion, she joint ed to the clock. "Were you waiting tip for me, dear?" asked Vandeloup, audaciously. "Not I," retorted Miss Twoxhy. toss ing her curl papers "I've been attending to par's business." ciiaiti:ii XV. Madame Midas, as may lie easily guess d, did not pass a very pleasant night after the encounter with Villiers. Her head was very painful with the blow she had given her, and added to this she was ertain she had killed him. Though hIic hated the man who had ruined her life, and who had tried to rob her, still she did not caro about be tvining Ills murdcrevf, and the thought was madness to fier. Not that she waH afraid of punishment, for she had acted only in self-defense, and Villiers, not nh; was the aggresor. Meanwhile she waited to hear if the body had been found, for ill news travels fact ; and as everyone knew Villiers was Iter husband, she wns satisfied that when the corpse was found she would be the first to be told about it. Hut the day wore on, and no news came, so she asked Archie to go into Itallarot and see if the lisoovery had been made. " Deed, mem," said Archie, in a con soling tone, "I'm thinkln' there's no word at all. Maybe ve only stopped his pranks for a woo bit, and lie's all right." "I gave him such a terrible blow, she said, mournfully, "and he fell like a stone over the cnibnnkmetit." "lie did not leave go the. nugget, any how', ye know," said Archie, dryly; "so he couldn't have been very far gone, but I'll go to the town and see what I can hear." There was no need for this, Iiowever, for just as' Mcintosh got. to the door, Vandeloup, cool ami complacent, saunter ed in. but .stopped short at. the sight of Mrs. Villiers sitting in the arm chair look. ing so ill. "My dear Madame." he cried in dismay, going over to her; "what is the matter with you?" "Matter enough," growled Mcintosh, with his hand on the door handle; "that husband ' hers has robbed her o'-.tlio nugget." "Yes, and I killed liim,". said Madame between her clenched teeth. "Tlie mischief you did," said VamMoup. in surprise, taking a seat, t lion ne wns the liveliest dead ninn 1 ever saw." "What do you mean?" asked Madame, eaning forward, with both hands grip ping the arms of her chair; "is is lie alive?" "Of course he logan Vandeloup; I " but here he was stopped by a cry from Selina, for her mistress had I. 1 . I . . 1 J A iniien uacK in a oeau iaiiu. Hastily waving the men to go away, she applied remedies and Madame soon revived. Mrs. Villiers felt intense dis gust toward her husband as she sat with tightly clenched bonds and dry eyes listen ing to Vandeloup s reclial. "Well." said Mr. Mcintosh at length, rubbing his scanty hair, "this child of lie- Hal is flourishing like a green bay tree by many waters; but we may cut it down an' lay an axe at the root thereof." "And how do you propose to chop liim down?" asked Vandeloup flippantly. "Put him in jail for running away wl' the nugget, retorted Mr. Mcintosh, vin dictively. "A verv sensible suggestion, ' said Gas ton, approvingly. "Now that he has obtained what lie wanted, perhaps he'll leave me alone; I will do nothing," said Madame Midas. "Do nothing!" echoed Archie, in great wrath. "Will ye lot that frienil o I'.eel- zebub run away with a three hun'rod ounces of gold an' do nothing?" Keep the nugget ! Never !" This wat the first time that Archie hail ever dared to cross Mis. Villiers wishes, and she stared in amazement at the unwonted spectacle. Tills time, how- eer, Mcintosh fiSunil an unexpected ally in Vandeloup, who urged that illiers should be prosecuted. ' "He is not only guilty of robbery, Mad ante," said the young I'reiichman, "but also of an attempt to murder you. and while he is allowed to go free your lit is not safe." Selina also contributed her mite of Wisdom in tho form of a provVrb: "A stitch in time saves, nine," intimat ing t hereby that Mr.,, VUHers should be locked up and never let out again, in case lie tried the same game on with the nest big nugget found. Meanwhile there was another individual in Hallarat who was much interested in Villiers, and this kind-hearted gentleman was none other than Silvers. Villiers was accustomed to come and sit in Ids olllce every morning mid talk to him about things in general, and the l'nctolus elatm., in particular. On this moridng, how over, he did not arrive, and Slivers was much annoyed thereat. He deterunned to give Villiers a piece of his mind when he did see him. "He went about his busi ness at "The Corner," bought some shares, sold others, ami swindled as many jwoplw as he was able, then came back to Ids office and waited in all tho afternoon for his friend, 'who, Iiowever did not come.
