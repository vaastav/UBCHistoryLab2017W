OTHER WASHINGTON MATTERS TOUCHED UPON Congress Looks With Disfavor Upon Any Increase of Power for the President—Military and Political Blacklegs Busy Once More—The Pure Food Question Again. Washington, D. C., Dec. 13.—The president's message was the most lm .portant matter before the country this week, and a wonderful message it was no matter from what view point you look at it To the critic and pessimist it gave offense because of the vast scope of the subjects covered and the fact that some matters were touched on that have for years been given ov er to the clergy, the Judiciary, and other usurpers of public thought. To the average citizen it presented a kal eidoscopic view of many important subjects, and there seems to be a ling ering hope in the minds of even the moBt rabid critics that the president's efforts will not be In vain. The impression created in the minds of Easterners by the message in ref erence to the colored race is very favorable. The sentiment in Washing ton is divided between the rabid ^southerners and prejudiced radicals from the north, happily the great mass of the people believe that both extremes are in error. The rap at the hysteria and sensationalism created by yellow Journals and the reference to child labor were both well received' while the recommendation for "ade quate control and regulation of rail ways to prevent the undesirable move for government ownership" appears to please everybody but the radicals. As predicted, the discharge of three companies of colored troops because of an alleged refusal to testify against their comrades was the subject of a controversy that will be played on all winter. It is doubtful if official action looking to their reinstatement in the army will be taken, but the matter will receive such a thorough airing that Its Te-currence will be prevent ed If found to have been precipitate in this case. Regardless of the action of congress and the president the courts will be called upon to decide whether the chief executive can "fire" a man without recourse to court mar tial. The theory that court martial trials are not severe enough is out considered tenable, for the Impression prevails in Washington that the enlist ed men of the army are not consider ed much better than automatons. Congress will be slow to give to the president authority to dismiss from the navy during times of peace offi cers whom he thinks unworthy to wear the uniform. There Is no dispo sition to believe that the president of the United States would dismiss a man for personal reasons, but the oractlce (Continues on Page 4.)

Dieterle, the speaker, has a very pleas ing personality and has the faculty in a large degree of holding the interest of her hearers and enlisting their sym pathy.

MAKE PAVING BRICK Local Concern Hag Had Material Tested and Found That it Would Make Good Paving. The statement made last night by Prof. Babcock that a good grade of paving brick could be manufactured from Grand Forks clay, led The Even ing Times to investigate the matter* Louis Campbell, secretary of the Red River Valley Brick company, was asked as to the value of the clay. He stated that more than a year ago, his company had sent to the Holmes com pany, manufacturers of paving brick at Sargent Bluff, Iowa, a car load of the clay taken from one of their yards near this city, and had it manu factured into brick. The report of the company was that It would make a good grade of paving material. The matter was not pushed for business reasons. It was thought that the de mand for this kind of material would not justify the expenditure required to build and equip a plant for the manufactory of the same. The plant would cost at least $20,000 and the fact that in order to secure a con tract, a fight must be made in every city, similar to the one which is now on over the selection of paving ma terial for this city, would make It a profitless enterprise.
