VOL. IT. CONGRESSIONAL. BOTH HOUSES OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE IN SESSION. Senate Debate on Civil Service Reform— Participated in by Pendletor, Daw<s and Hill— The Republican Record on the Question Shown up !>v Hill— A Purely Business Session in the House— After the Reference of 750 Bills it Adjourns to Friday Next. Senate. Washington, Dec. 13.— Senators Maxey, Vest, Groom and Ferry presented petitions for railroad charges. Senator Hoar, from the committee on rules, reported back the resolution for a select com mittee of seven to be appointed.by the chair, on the extension of suffrage to women or the removal of their legal disabilities. He asked unanimous consent for the present considera tion of the resolution. Vest objected. Senator Ransom submitted a resolution con stituting a select committee of five to inquire into and report as to the condition of the Po tomac river from the city of Washington, the navigability of said river, the effect of bridges across the same upon navigation, floods, and health of the city, and what action ought to be taken in the premises, etc. Adopted, and Senator Ransom, Jones, (Nev.), Helloes, con stituted such committee. At the close of forenoon business, Pendle ton took the floor upon his bill to regulate and improve the civil service. He defined the spoils system thus: The universal rule (if there be any exception, it only emphasizes the rule), is that service in office, was partisan work and official salary as pay, and a change in office holders. As soon as the salary shall have been paid for the work, or a better or newer worker appears. He traced Guiteau's motive in shooting President Garfleld, and the fact is potent that he wanted an office and did not get it, and he believed the president was responsible for his failure.He wanted a new deal a new distribution of offices. He believed a new president would make a new distribution and that he would have another chance. His desire for office and the belief that he had earned it, the belief that the president could and sought to divide the spoils among the vic tors, the brutality of our politics which tra duces character and vilifies motives wherever a difference of opinion or action exists, these made hig crime possible. For the assassin to assert that he thought he was doing his party and his country a service, these are fes tering beds in which such fools are born into such madness, and such schemes of wicked deviltry are hatched. The act of Guiteau is exceptional. The causes which con tributed to it are imbedded, in our system and are ever present. Of the effect of the spoils system on public men and public service Sena tor Pendltton said: "This system drives sena tors and representatives into such a position that not only do they neglect the chief duties of legislation, but too oiten they are tempted by their friends and supporters and are almost coerced to make support of the administra tion, conditional upon their obtaining offices for their friends. Nor is this alftior even the worst. His appeal to love of money and love of patronage as stimulants to exertion creates a fierce and brutal party spirit which Btops at no wrong in the accomplish ment of its end. It makes an intelligent exer cise of the elective franchise impossible. It makes a free election and fair count impossi ble. It levies contributions on the salaries of all officers and expends a vast sum thus col lected in corrupting votera. It lowers the tone and degrades the sentiment not only of public men, but, more important •still, of a whole people behind them. We must supplant this system. We must chase it out with hue and cry. In its place we must put another and better system, founded on the idea that public offices and public trusts, to be administered solely for public good; that the fittest man shall admin ister them until a still fitter and better man shall be found; that offices have no right to be, except that a faithful execution of the duties attached to them is necessary to the public welfare, and the maximum of efficiency and minimum of coat is the constitutional condition on which they should exist. We must establish the idea that the business of fifty million of people must be transacted by business men, upon busice?s principles, and all the more rigidly and faith fully because it is the business of the people." Pendleton then explained at length the scope of his bill, saying he invited criticisms and discussion of it. He closed as follows: "I appeal to the senators on the other side of this chamber. You have the administration. You have the offices. You are enjoying the power and emoluments. This bill does not disturb you in the possession of them. I ap peal to the senators on this side of the cham ber. We are in the minority. We have no of fices now. The chances of time will sooner or later put them in our grasp. Let us now de clare that we will have none of those offices, except those which may be won by merit. Let us give this earnest of our sincerity in this great reform. Let us give this token of purity and patriotism of our coming administration of the government. Let us convince the people, even our opponents, that we contend for power, not that we may enjoy the elements of office, but that we may lead the country in the pathways of advancement and beneficence under the inspiration of true Democracy.Patronage,however pleasant for the moment, is a curse to any man. Let us put it behind us now. Let us do the right now. Let us destroy it now, and we will in future reap our full inestimable reward in having dis engaged our party and our president from the influences of which will surely plant seeds of early defeat in our coming victory, and in having saved our country from the perils which now environ it.'" After Pendleton's remarks, Dawes, replying to the criticisms upon his position on the subject by Pendleion, said they were due to his own inability, both now and in the last congress, to support that feature of the sena tors measure providing for the establishment in Washington of a board of examiners, or im perium in impero, with no prescribed tenure, ■who are to superintend and control all exam inations in all departments and^Hß^l^Hl civil service covered by the bill. The eenater now argu«d that he (Dawes) for this reason, did not want to have any legislation on the subject. His own effort had been to awaken a public sentiment out of which would be evolved legislation of practical utili ty and he had stated and reiterated that for ten years the statute books had contained au thority enough to accomplish everything the most ardent reformer desired to hare accom plished. He believes a board, such as is pro posed, would depend for iU ef ficiency, solely upon the spirit of the executive who appointed it. His own conviction was that the remedy for abuses in the civil service was in the peo ple of the country, and could only be applied in full by them. "Hill, of Georgia, said ia his judgment the difficulty was not in want of legislation, and therefore it was very difficult to see how the remedy waß to be applied by legislation. One great difficulty, he thought, was that while everybody was preaching very earnestly on civil service reform, nobody was practising it, and it did not teem to make any difference to the people whether their representatives were practicing it or not. While the country was weeping over the tragic end of the president, a federal judge was soiling his ermine by indicting a letter to the successor of that president; one who by reason of the corrupt civil service complained of, had succeeded k> office, appeal ing to him to make appointments on purpose to please that judge and "cementiag our coa lition" in Virginia to control the state elec tion. What was that coalition? It was to secure to the Republicans the offices of the state. The senator from Ohio had said that much, but had not told the country that the president to whom that letter had been ad dressed, while yet the morning sobs of the people were echoing around him, sat down and made the very appointment which that judge had designated as "cementing our coali tion," and then perhaps with the same ink had written a homily on civil service reform, to be introduced into bis message to congress. This was the way we were expressing civil service reform, Was the president to be blamed for this? Had he not the right to assume that everybody in this country who talked about civil service reform was merely playing with the people? Were there not scores of men now present in the senate who had heard read from that very desk of the clerk a communication from a former secretary of the treasury, and a former president of the United States, insist ing upon the removal from the New York cus tom house of the man who was now that very president, upon the ground that he had made it the headquarters of a political party, and that his removal was necessary to insure an Latest administration of public office? yes, that very man who was removed from the New York custom house, on the grounds that an honest administration of his office required his removal was the man who was nominated for the next highest office in the gift of the people, and the men by whom those comunications were sent to the senate took the stump for his election. This was the civil service reform practiced by the leaders of the Republican party. And why should not snch things be done? Did not everybody know that every man, high or low, black or white, who was charged with cennec tion with the returning board frauds of 1876, received office from the administration, which obtained the presidency by virtue of those frauds ? Had not members now before him heard witnesses testify under oath in relation to that matter, that they had purposely com mitted perjury for the sake of obtaining office? The Senator from Mass., (Dawes), uttered one great truth when he said the trouble in all this was with the people. If the people would visit their condemnation on the politi cal party, or the members of that parjy, that thus degraded and bebauched the civil service the abuses would so»n cease. Voorhees said he had no speech, to make, but would ask for the reading of a joint resolution he had prepared on the subject. The joint resolution was read and referred to the com mittee on judiciiry. It proposes an amend ment to the constitution providing that all postmasters, revenue collectors, judges, mar shals, and United States district attorney for district courts of the United States shall be elected by the people of the state in which their duties are to be performed, and in such manner as the legislatures shall provide. Pendleton's bill was then informally laid on the table and Beck's presidential succession bill was taken up in order to have precedence to-morrow. Beck temporarily yielded the floor. Bills introduced and referred: To incorpor ate the inter-ocean ship railway company. Also, for commissioners to ascertain what just claims for services by officers and privates of military organizations in Missouri, in the suppression of the rebellion, in concert with and subject to the orders of the United States authorities, still remain unpaid and not as sumed by said state. Davis (West Virginia), submitted a resolu tion directing the secretary of the interior to furnish as early as possibly a statement show ing, first, what frauds, if any, been discovered in the department of pension?, the nature and character thereof, under the various pension acts, whether in the pension office, by pension agents, or in any bureau of any department in which information relative to tue granting of pensions is obtained, and what legislation, if any, he recommends to protect the gov ernment from such fraudulent blaira and honest pensioners from fraud and extortion; second, what amount of arrearages has been paid under the "arrears act" of 1879 up to Jan. 1, 1881, with the number of cases added to the pension roll, and the applications now pending under said act; third, the estimated amount reqnired annually to pay settlers and pending cases under said acts, the estimated total cost of arreaiages of pensions, the an nual amount after arrearages have been deter mined of the regular pension roll, and the to tal cost.

It empowers the Mis souri & Niobrara Valley Railroad company to construct and operate said north branch from Sioux City, lowa, westward so as to connect with the Union Pacific west of Cheyenne under the conditions of the original Union Pacific charter of 186±, except the company is to receive no subsidy in bonds. Logan, from the committee on military af fairs, reported with amendments the bill to place Gen. Grant on the army retired list. Maxey, of the committee said the report just made was not unanimous, and he would indi cate his objections to it at the proper time. On motion of Edmunds, the committee on library was instructed to inquire into the ex pediency of purchasing for the congressional library the printad records and briefs of cases in the supreme court of the United States, now the property of the estate of the late M. H. Carpenter. Edmunds submitted a resolution, requesting the president, if, in his opinion, not incompat ible with public interest, to communicate to the senate all the correspondence between the government of the United States and its diplo matic agents in Peru and Chili since Arpil 1 , 1579, touching public affairs In or between these states, and also such correspondence on the subject as may be in possession of the de partment. Agreed to without dissent. A resolution was also adopted instructing the committee on military affairs to inquire what legislation isjneeded to enable the widows and heirs of soldiers to secure the benefits and bounties of said soldiers while living, and re maining unpaid at the time of their death. The report of the committee on privileges and elections, upon removals affecting the title of the New York senators to their seats, was laid on the table. After a statement by Garland that upon examination he saw noth ing to dissent from in the report, this action was regarded as a final disposition of the mat ter. Voorhees gave notice of his intention to speak to-morrow upon his resolution refer ring to the committee on finance, that por tion of the president's message in regard to the repeal of the silver acts authorizing silver coinage and the issue of silver certificate. Davis (Illinois) offered a bill for a second circuit judge for the Seventh judicial circuit of the United Btates. After a short executive cession the senate adjourned. House.

PAUL, WEDNESDAY MOENING, DECEMBER 14, 1881. GAIOLMTEAU. BE DID MOST OF THE TALKING IX r COURT YESTERDAY. Testimony of Dr. Spltzka Concluded— And is the Best Tet Produced for the Defense . — Ihe Assassin Tries to Choke Off Other Witnesses by Abuse -—Also Pays His : Hsu -.1 Compliment to Corkhlll. - Washington, Dec. 18.— Spitika resumed his testimony in the Guiteau case to-day. Corkhill handed to the witness slips of papers on which were drawn diagrams of the human head, and eald: "Now, doctor, supposing this to be the prisoner's head, will you please point out the inequalities to which you re ferred yesterday?" Before any reply could be made, Guiteau raised a laugh by saying: "That accounts for it. A hatter came to see me this morning and offered me a hat if I would let him take my head. I got the hat but you don't pay for it, Corkhill. Oh, no. The government will have to do so. Witness went on giving his reasons for considering the prisoner insane. Again a question being asked by Corkhill, Guiteau broke in with, "I have been looking up your record, Corkhill, and I'll show you up." Subsequently Guiteua again tnterrupted the examination and shouted: "I see that crank, Talmage, has been doing some sensationalism business in this case; He had better go slow. He has been before the synod several times for lying, and has a reputation in New York for running for houses of prostitution. I have got my eye on several of these cranks, and if they don't go slow I'll give some of them some free advertising. The enlightened portion of the American people are beginning to take a right view of -this case." Scoville endeavored to introduce as evidence what he (Scoville) had said in relation to Shaw, a witness for the prosecution, by ask ing witness to state to the jury what he (Sco- Vila) had told him. Witness— "He said he had learned in rela tion to Shaw—" Objection was made and sustained, when Guiteau shouted out: "We have found out that Shaw was guilty of perjury in New Jer sey, and was told by the judge from the bench that ha ought to be convicted and Bent to prison. We also know that English was con victed of a low crime in Ireland. The Jury ought to know what kind of witnesses you are bringing here to ruin my reputation." Witness thought the proper way to sum mon experts would be for the court to sum mon them, irrespective of the chances what their testimony might be. Corkhill insisted that witness had attacked the character and honesty of experts who were supposed to en tertain an opposite opinion from himself on the prisoners sanity. Guiteau interrupted in his worst angry mood, and, shaking his head at Col. Corkhill, shouted: "It is the unanimous judgment of the American people that you are a consum mate Jackass, Corkhill. This gentleman is an honest man, and if your skull was not so thick you would see it " Witness desired to explain his position, and said: "I do not hesitate to reiterate my opin ion that an expert, who will in this court tes tify that the prisoner is sane is in my opinion is no expert, or a dishonest one." Dr Fordece Barker, of New York, was next examined. The audience listened intently as the distinguished physician defined insanity and the general phases thereof. Dr. Barker's com prehensive and positive conclusions were all in accord with the theory of the prosecution. Judge Cox requested witness to explain to the jury what he meant by "Irresistible impulse," and the answer was: "Perversions of emotion to such a decree as to produce conduct entire ly at variance with the individuals former life, and to such a degree as to completely control the will power, would constitute an irresistible impulse. "| Guiteau — "Doctor, I want to ask you, when a man is impelled to commit a crime by an impulse he cannot resist, is he sane or insane?" Ans.— "When that fact be proved, sir, it is insanity." Guiteau— "That's Just my case, sir," with an air of perfect satisfaction. Then turning to Scoville, "come, that's the whole case. Let's have recess. I'm getting hungry." Mrs. Scoville desired to ask a question. Guiteau (impatiently) — "Oh, you keep still. Its all they can do to put up with me." Judge Cox assented and Mrs. Scoville asked: "Can a man be born insane?" Ans.— "No, madame; he could be born an idiot, or an im becile. Insanity is an acquired state after birth." Recess. After recess L. 8. Gobell, of New York, took the witness stand. Guiteau— "lf your honor, please, I would like to know what they expect to prove by this witness? I think we have had about enough of this kind of testi mony. I only know this man slightly." Judge Cox— "lt is no necessary to state in advance. Go on Mr. witness." Witness was in the life insurance business. Prisoner decided to solicit for him. Witness paid him $200, but never realized any business from his efforts. Prisoner told witness he was about to marry a wealthy lady and was to have the Austrian mission, and wanted to borrow $200. Pris oner did not evince evidence of unsound mind. W. P. Copeland, Journalist, callnd, and iden tified some newspaper slips. Guiteau— •*¥ou are no lawer, Copeland." H. L. Ketcham, of New York, attorney a law, knew prisoner in 1873, when he occupied a desk in the office of Judge Hawes. Witness related the instance of Guiteau's obtaining money under false pretenses. Scoville objected* to all testimony going to show the commission of any other crime or misdemeanor by the prisoner. Guiteau (indignantly)— "l never got a cent from this man in my life. He was only a poor clerk. I didn't consider him a proper asso ciate for a high-toned lawyer like myself." The prisoner continually interrupted, and insisted the evidence was entirely irrelevant. Finally turning to Scoville, he said: "You are getting badly cranked on this matter. If you had any sense you would know it doesn't do our cate any good. You'll' be on trial as a crank yourself if you don't look out. Why, you are getting worse than Corkhill." Henry Wood, of Philadelphia, had known prisoner some yeif'. Never saw anything to indicate he was < ; unsound mind. Always thonjjht he was r > > --essed of good intelligence. Witness knew Guiteau's wife, some of his family having rendered her service. Guiteau called upon him to thank the family for their kindness. Guiteau here took occasion to slander bis wife In the most outrageous terms. "This man," he said, "knew her before I did. You can draw your own inference." Samuel B. Phelpe, of New York, had known the prisoner since 1868. First knew him in Chicago. Guiteau became extremely angry at state ments made by witness, and rattled a perfect tirade of abuse. Several minutes elapsed be fore the examination could proceed. Witness In past years had known the prisoner, and never saw anything to indicate he was of unsound mind. The cross examination was continued till adjournment, and was frequently interrupted by Guiteau with contradictions and denials. When witness said Guiteau had desired him (witness) to act as editor-in-chief of one of his newspaper projects, Guiteau laughed im moderately for some minutes and shouted: "Oh, Phelps! that is certainly a down right absurdity. You for chief editor." Adjourned. Chicago Scale company platform scale, en tirely new, win be sold cheap. Apply at Globs office. 54-inch Cloaking, $1.23 a yard, at H. E. Mann, 432 Wabasha w street.

B&AINB'S DIPLOMACY. r London, Dec. 13.— The Standard, in a lead ing article on Blame's instructions sent to the American minister at Lima, says: It may be absurd, but it is only carrying the Monroe doc trine to its legitimate conclusion, to assume that by and by, we shall see representatives deputed from Washington to control the re lations of the Emperor of Brazil with the European powers, and the savages of Pata gonia, invoking the aid of the United States commission to compose these differences. What is the temper of the cabinet at the pres ent moment? We can only infer from the growth of the Chauvinist sentiment which has confused th« discussion of the canal question as well as Peru. It is not wholly perhaps a matter of sentiment. It is true Blame has re signed and the Americans will have no longer to admire the glowing period in which he has maintained the pretensions of his country, but American diplomacy is uniform. It will be much the same whether the dispatches are penned by Frelinghausen or Blame. It is not improbable that President Arthur may soon announce that peace is restored and a new pro tectorate be established. Maitland, one of the proprietors of the Liv erpool Mercury, and president of the Press As sociation is dead. The absence of news from the balloon in which Walter Powell was carried to sea Satur day causes a great sensation. Poweli had a project to cross the Atlantic in a balloon. At a meeting of the royal geograpical soci ety last night a proposition was made that a ship be sent next summer to aid in the search for the Jeannette. A meeting will be held at Chapter house, Westminster abbey, to-day, to consider the subject of creating a fund for a memorial of the late Dean Stanley. The Prince of Wales will move the resolutions which will be sec onded by Lord Granville and supported by Lowell, American minister. 

AUSTRIA. Vienna, Dec. 13.— Seventy-seven bodies were removed from tha ruins of the theater yesterday, also a quantity of fragments of bodies, feet and hands, which were not bnrn ed. On uncovering some of the debris from the ruins of the theater to-day, additional bodies were discovered in a good state of pres ervation. Information received up to this forenoon shows] that fifty persons who were reported missing still survive, but these fifty are counter-balanced by tha transmissions of names of persons who are really missing. The investigation with the cause of the disaster being made by the tri bunal for criminal offenses, apart from that instituted by the police authorities, is intended to examine persons who have communicated to the newspapers their experience the night of the fire. AFTERNOON SESSION. F..r Sale. A Floed ef Novell. Why do so many people write novels? Are they moved by a desire for fame? Who reaches fame nowadays »y the math of fiction? Two or three in a asMmfion, perhaps, and the meet that ue otken gain is a little noteotety — sach a little! All the dozens ef ladies amd gentleman who produce three-volume novels can not in their wildest dreams believe them* selves Austens or Thaokerays. Is money the bait? Alas! a cemmedity so very abundant cannot be otherwise than cheap; and novels arc like fish in one re spect at least— the profit made on them goes chiefly to the middle-Mea. Is there, then, a veritable charm to many peeple in seeing themselves in print? Perhaps that may account for ii Whatever the motive maybe, it must surely be a pretty strong one that induces anybody to go through the mere manual labor of writ ing five hundred pages er so; and there are floods of novels being poused upon us every month, every week— every day, almost a perfect sea el literature, in which wit and wisdom axe caning nearer and nearer to the meagre prepor tionsof Falstaffs pennyworth of sack. Things have already reached such a pass, that the critic is thankful when he finds a book not very dull er very vul gar — a tissue of impossibilities, or a far rago of foolishness. One amnwng ohap ter refreshes his spirit, one natural chap ter makes him feel that he has found a spring in the desert If he neither goes to sleep over the second volume nor throws it away from him in uncontrol able exasperation, he is so pleased at the end that he says, "Really that is a very good story, not at all bad company for an hour or two," and straightway sets to work to inform the public that they can not do better than to read Mr. So-and- So's hist book.

Relapses In Typhoid Fever. Some people depend wholly on domes tic treatment in typhoid fever. They seem to be successful; for, in the large majority of cases — eight out of ten — the system throws it off wholly apart from medicine, especially if there is a itrong circulation of pure air in tho room, and the body is frequently sponged wit i cold water, or better, with a weak solution of common soda. The fact, however, that one cannot know beforehand the c i. trac tor of the case, makes it always safest in the hand of a faithful physician wl .o can watch it and care for it according ;<» the symptoms. This seems the more important ii view of the discovery recently made b;r the late Dr. Irvine, of England, respocting relapses of typhoid fever, of which the London Lancet says, "To most of us it comes like a revelation." He has shown that these most trc able some contingencies are much more fre quent than is generally supposed by the profession; that, in fact, there are often several, the first predisposing to a sec ond, that a real relapse may set in arith ont any interval of covanLascence and that many cases of the disease, when they first come under the notice oi the physician, ate relapses, following v wn a mi£d primary attack. The fever normally lasts twenty- right days. A first relapse, where thers are no complications, huts twenty or twenty one days* subsequent relapses are each shorter than that immediately prece. ting. The interval of convalescence between the first attack and the first relipee, averages about five days, during which the temperature is natural, or nearl j so. The onset of the relapse is marked by a sudden rise of temperature, which reaches its height by the fifth day, Tnarnf^ipiT^ a high level until the eight or ninth, when it falls decidedly, bat again rises and gradually declines t<> the end on the twentieth or twenty- first day.

There was quite a talk among some of the Democrats of the house, in connection with the coming contested cases, about a report that Curtin or other Democratic members from Pennsylvania threatening to retaliate upon the rebel brigadiers for voting against Curtin in his contest for Yocums seat in the last con gress. Curtin and friends allege that the ex confederates voted against him because of his record as the war governor of Pennsylvania and his services in putting down the rebellion. Chalmers voted against Curtin, and now it is whispered that Curtin, Beltzehoover and other Democrats will, iv retaliation, vote against Chalmers when the contest for his seat comes up. There have been open threats indulgsd in, and some of the southern Demo crats, are stirred up about the matter, and if retaliatory action of that begins, they will keep it up. A southern member said this morning that the time for northern Democrats to dictate to southern was passed, and that dictation drove Mahone out of the party and would drive more out. A STRIKE AT BLAINE. The introduction of a resolution to-day in the senate, calling for copies of the corres pondence between the state department and the ministers to Peru and Chili, in relation to the affairs of those governments, is said to be a strike at Blame from the 6talwart quarter. It is claimed that Blame has only given out such of this correspondence as tends to relieve the state department from the responsibility for any misunderstanding, but that the entire correspondence will show that the best adviceß of the United States were against the course adopted by Blame, and that the state depart ment is to blame for the trouble.

The governor of New York has respited Ostrander, who was to be hung at Rome Thursday.
