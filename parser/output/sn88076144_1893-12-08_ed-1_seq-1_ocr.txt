Tariff the Principal Topic —The Sherman Law Civil 1 Service. It is hardly necessary for me to state [that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior lo the iustMlinent of tlie present administration the existing gov ernment of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated the pro fl visional government of the islands and tho United States, and submitted to the sen S.itcfor ratification. This treaty I with drew for examination and despatched ^Hon. James II. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commissioner, to ^make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attending the change of government, and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough And exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to mc his report, showing be yond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii Had lleen Subverted with the active aid of our representative to thatgovernmentandthrough the intim idation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our minister, I'pon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honora ble course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any chauged condition brought about by our Unjustifiable Interference, our present minister at Honolulu has re ceived appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information of the ac complishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional ad vices are soon expected, and when received they will be promply sent to congress, to gether with all other information at hand, accompanied by a special executive mes HSge ftdrfTfctaffigg-aM^ie Wets necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history frf all the national events leading up to the present situation. Department Reports. Jn regard to the matters naturally fall ing to the different departments of the .: government the president make?#, but few recommendations beyond endorsing the views of the cabiuet officers as expressed in their annual reports. He lays particu lar stress upon thto desiiafbiliU* of one or two changes in the department of justice, and especially upon the recommendation of the uttoiney general that, tho l'rcet.ys tcm of compensation of marshals, clerks of federal courts and district attorneys be abolished. Satisfactory progress has been made in the navy department, but the president recommends that new vessels should not a be authorized until some of those in pro cess of building are more nearly completed. He thinks this the more essential on ac count of the low condition of the treasury. 5* Good progress has also been made in the war department. The total strength of the army is 25,578 enlisted men and 2,144 jl officers. The total enrollment of militia is 112,597. Coast defenses are progressing favorably, and much needed improvement is being rapidly accomplished. The work on the projected Chickamauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with aeal and judg es went, and its opening will be celebrated during the coming year. The work of lo eating and preserving the lines of battle at l! the Gettysburg battlefield is making satis factory progress on the plans directed by the last congress. In regard to Indiaus, he thinks the & allotment of lands in severalty should be made with great care and circumspection. $ If hastily done, before the Indian knows its meaning, while yet ho has little or no idea of tilling a farm, and no conception of •}. thrift, there is great danger that a reservi tion life in tribal relations may be ex changed for the pauperism of civilization, instead of its independence and elevation, THE 

SHERMAN LAW. .r- Its Repeal Has Changed the Complex Ion of Our Currency LHWH, Th® recent repeal of the provision of the law requiring the purchase of silver bul lion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs and do not^Mibt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far-reaching. i-. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, o"r what, if any, supplemen* tary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, appear to be essential or expe dient. Of course, after the recent finan cial perturbation Time is Necessary for the re-establishment of busiuess confi dence. When, however, through this re stored confidence the money which has been frightened into hoarding places is re turned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose as safe a path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet •very requirement of our lncreaRlng popa lation and its business. In ,th.e of thle object we sliould rMOlutely turn «w»y from alluring Md tempting exi^m ents, determined to be content ing less than a lasting and c°mprehenslve financial plan.

WASIIIXGTON, Dec. 4.—The president's huessage, which circumstances have made lof peculiar iuterest, has been sent to con.- The President Wants Tariff ltcMluctlon At i^rcss, and, according to immemorial cus om, read in botli houses. The president begins with foreign af fairs and ends with the tariff. lu regard jto foreign relations he says that while (those relations have not at all times been free from perplexity, no embarrassing sit uations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fairness'and love of justice which, ioined with consistent firmuess, character ize a truly American foreign policy. Bra zilian affairs, the Chilian incident, the Geary law and its probable, outcome, the Hebringsea. matter, Xicaraguau revolu tions and American interests as affected [thereby, Russian and Norwegian extradi tion treaties and many otlie*matters are touched upon briefly.

TARIFF REFORM. Once. At this time, wheu a depicted publio ti-cas ury confronts us. when many of our people are engaged In a hard struggle for the neces saries ot' life aiul wheu enforced economy Is pressing upon the i^reat liutyi ol' our country n:en. I desire to ur/e with all tho »riie-itne&s at my command that congressional legislation IWl on 1*«. ...J..... 1. fl. S a ury and a sympathy with lie strained ircum stancos of our fellow citizcns. Tho duty of public economy is also of im mense importance in its intimate and neces sary relation to the task now in hand of pro viding rcvenuo to meet government expendi tures and yet reducing the peop c\s burden of federal taxation. I After a Hard Struggle tariif reform is directly before us. Nothing so inipc»rtant c'aitus our attention and noth ing so clearly presents it.elf us both an oppor tunity and a dn ty—an opiwrtunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citiz us. a dutV im posed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by iheemp n-.ic mandnto of the people- After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform ami they have confided the w« rk of its accomplishment in the hands of those who are Solemnly Pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory of a rep resentation in public places of the people and their desires ?f publio oflleers are ready tho servantsof the people,and its political prom ises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will bo sheer recreancy. Nothing slio.ild iu tervene to distract our attcntiou or disturb our effort until this reform is accomplished by wise ami careful legislation. Discriminating Cam Necessary• While we should staunchly adhere to the principle that only tho cessity of revenue justillcs the im]osit.ion of t:tvi!Y duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by su-iet economy, wo cannot cloo oureyu* to the fact that conditions havo grown up among UH which in ju.-ti and fai. nc6s call for discriminating caro In the distrioution of such duties and tuxation as tho ncrgenci of our government actually demand. -Manifestly if we ar* to aid the people di rectly through tariff reform onu of its most obvious f.MI: mc» touitl a reduction in the present tuiiJI charges Upon the NfOi'NMU'k'ti 1' Life. The beneiits of such a r«:t!uction wou'd bo palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thousands who would be bettor fed and better clothed and belter shellere I. These gifts should bo the willing benel'a-:ions ofagov niucnt who highest fnaelion is the pro motion of tho welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our peop.e's prosperity aud well-being is tli-j removal of restrictions upon the importati 11 of the raw materials neces sary to our manufa -tureis. Tim world should bo open to our national ingenuity aud enter prise. This cannot be while federal legisla tion, through the imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manufacturers! as cheap material as those u-cd by th .ir ompe itors. It is quite obvious that ihc enhancement of the price of our manufactured products re sulting from this policy not only confines tho market for these produ ts within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The Interests of Labor are certainly though indirectly involved in this feature of our tarllf system. The sharp competition and active strugglo among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon tills the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of woik iu mills and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress in the homes of our workingmen. Even if the uften disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wayes would resul from freo raw materials aud low tarilT, does not the in telligence of our workingmen lead them quickly lo discover that their steady employ ment permitted by free raw materials is the most important, factor in their relation to tariff legislation'/ Wilson JS1U Commended. A measure has been prepared by the appro priate congrjsblonal co.umittco embodying tariff reform on th« line^ herein suggested, whiyn will be promptly submitted for legisla tive action. It is tho result or^nuch patriotic and unselfish work, and 1 believe it deals with its subject consistently and thoroughly as ex isting conditions permit. 1 a satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation,added tocxistng internal revenue taxation, will in the near-future, though perlia.s not immediately, produco sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The Tax on Corporation*. Ihe commit:ee, after full consideration and to provide for a tempom deficiency, wMch may exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff scheiules,havo wisely embraced in their plan a few addi tional internal, revenue taxes, i..eluding a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corporate investments. Tlictc new assess ments are not only absolutely just and ca ily borne, but they have the lurthermorit of being such as can be remitted without un favorable disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desiro for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only be obtained by means of unselfish counscl on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitious to tho geniral good. The local interests atfected by th proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted upon the legislation embody ing the reform inust inevitably fail. In Conclusion. In conclusion, my intense feeling of re sponsibility impels me to invoke for the manifold interests of a generous an 1 confiding people the most scrupulous care, and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort •for tho advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country.

WILSON BILL TO HAVE RIGHT OF WAY IN THE HOUSE. It Will Fiububly 12c Introduced on Thursday Debate on the Measure, However, Will Not Commence This Week. WASUIXCTOX, Dec. 4.—Interest in the regular session ol congress, which con vcw'd at liign noon, will center in the house win of tlie rapitol, where the new tnrifl' till is on the way. An cnor ICOXIS JIRETOIIRE for legislation of all hinds, jiublic and private, beneficial and otherwise, will exist from the iirst, but as soon as tl:e decks can le cleared tho tariff hill will have the right of way. The extraordinary session showed the purpose not only of eliminating tho sil ver question, hut advancing tho tariff lution. The Wilson bill will be intro duced in the house the latter part of tho week, probably Thursday. On that day tho 10 days allowed by the rule under which the tariff bill was filed during tho recess will expire. The estimates of the ltovonue to bo derived from the tariff bill are completed. They show that tho deficit in the revenues on tho basis of a gov ernmental expenditure of $!)r",000,000 a year will he raised to $G5,01)0,000, which might he raised from increased internal revenue taxes or an income tax. It is not probable that tho tax on whisky will be increased more than 10 cents per gallon, which will increase the revenue from this source $10,000,000. Although it was at one time last week practically decided in an inform al way to impose a tax on tho incomes legacies, there has sentiment and it is almost certain that a straight tax on individual incomes over $5,000 will bo recommended. Even if the Wilson bill is reported this week, it is not expected debate can begin until next week. THE ELECTIONS LAW. Bill for Its Kcjienl Will 15c Early Taken Up in the Semite.
