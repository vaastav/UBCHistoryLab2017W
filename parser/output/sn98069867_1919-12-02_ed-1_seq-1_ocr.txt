This is considered remarkable show ing for the first few. hours the order became effective. Still greater savings are expected hereafter. The official orders from the regional fuel committee at Atlanta were received at the office of the gas and electric company Tuesday afternoon. From a hasty examination, they appeared to be the same as announced in the news papers. Reserve Increases. tlnues to increase, with the awards to essential Industries and the retail trade continuing in about the same amounts as usual for the past ten days. There were 259 cars of coal in Mem phis terminals Tuesday, held by the railroad administration, subject to awards by the regional fuel committee It Atlanta, as compared with 177 cars Monday and 144 cars Saturday. For several days during the early part of last week the coal reserve In the local yards was below 0 ears. George C, Roach, vice-chairman of the Memphis district operating com mittee, in charge of the local distribu tion of coal, said that the official or ders pertaining to the restrictive meas ures taken by the Atlanta regional committee had not been received here Tuesday morning. Neither had William D. Kvser, U. S. district attorney, received the official orders. The only information received here Tuesday noon in regard to the fuel administration's orders was through the newspapers. 'o one here has been authorized to Interpret or to enforce the restrictive order, and th entire city Ji basing Its compliarM-a with the ru ing largely ae ons ana rders as levAoaMra. However. bv the full force of gov- state and city ever received mora hearty acceptance on the part of tne people than the luei conservation regulations are receiving here, and it Is doubtful If any lnw ever caused so many inconveniences and hardships, as well as financial losses, to the people as the fuel restrictions are causing at this time. Railroads Near Normal. Railroad service Is being maintained as usual, no further restrictions having fceen placed on the movement of freight, with the exception of the application of the cottonseed embargoes that have been in force on other lines for some time, to the Missouri Pacific, which up until Monday was the only local line .handling cotton seed. The Frisco embargoes on certain classes of dead freight are causing very little Inconvenience to local shippers. The Rock Island railroad Is now re ceiving more generous awards of coal. Iast week the Rock Island had barely enough coal to maintain Its service. All other lines operating out of Memphis ' are said to have sufficient coal for their immediate needs. Shipments of coal rthrough Memphis for railroad use in the Southwestern legion are heavier than ever known. The Southwest wan formerly supplied with coal from mines In Illinois, Ar kansas and Oklahoma, but now it is drawing its enal from Ksstcrn Tennes see Alabama and as far east as Virginia. Cine railroad but of Memphis handled more than 1.200 cars of coal to the Southwest last month. SOLON WOULD PROBE NEGRO V.0TE IN SOUTH WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.

In Kansas seven pits were worked and in Wes, Virginia operators said normal nrbductlon was In sight by the end of the week. Throughout the remainder of the country, however, min ers apparently remained steadfast In their determination not to return to work under the 14 per cent wage In crease ordered bv the federal govern ment and ai r eded to by the operators. In Wyoming new ' labor troubles threatened to decrease the'small amount of coal being brought out Rxcept for brief shut-downs at the beginning of the strike and twice since the mines In that state generally had maintained op eration. Members of the railroad brotherhoods in Kansas today were expected to act on a resolution adopted last night to request authority to refuse to handle coal mined by nonunion workers. Factories Hit.

Little Suffering. Despite low temperatures thai have spread over the West for the last few days, little actual suffering because of the fuel shortage had been reported to day. In Nebraska, where near zero weather prevailed, Kllgore had been without coal in days. Western Kansas, also without coal several days, was to obtain an emergency supply today, the first taken from the strip pits of that state. Suspension of all traffic over the St. Louis & San Francisco railroad lines out of Oklahoma City today was said to be only a matter of hours unless coal was supplied.

Assess ment Under Law Will Run More Than for Rest of the State. BIGGER RAISES ARE EXPECTED IN CITY County Property Owners Seem Stuck for 20 Per Cent More Than They Have Been Paying to State. Kor many year MemnhlB and Shelby rOttftty have been paying about one lth of ihe entire state tax. a manifest Injustice, for they do not eomprlse one Hih of the actual values of the atate. It was hoped by the buslnesa Inter eats of this county that under the new slale assessment laws which go Into effect Ihe first of next year tremendous Increases In assessment vsJuatlnna which are being made by the new atate hoard of eituallxatlon, which sre supposed to apply equally to every one of the H counties in the state, will not greatly relieve thla cniHlltlon, hut on the con trary Hggravate It. The agents of the state board of equalisation have practically completed their work in all the counties except Shelby and I'avldson In Shelby county nutslde of the city of Memphis the preliminary work has all been finished, and It Is stated that the general Increase In Ihe assessed val uation of Ihe land outside the city li mit less than 300 per cent. The present assessed valustlon of realty In the county proper, as It ap plies lo this vear'a tax aggregate, Is $11.69,!I40, or In round figures, 114,000. 000. If thai valuation Is Increased by the slate board of equalisation by 300 per cent, the total assessed valuation next year will therefore be in the c ounty (not Indudlhg the city) 136, 000,000. Lower Tax Rate. The new state assessment law and 'lie companion law fixing a sliding cule for taxation provides that as ths assessed value goes up the state tax lute must automatically come down. The total tsx rate this year Is (t cents. That may come down t 26 cents. iut It la up to the oounty ciAirt ss to what the county rate will he. The tmnl assessed valuation of realty In the sitate this year U In round fig ures IS e Agents of the state equalisation board set limit e I hat the average Increase In aasessed valuations throughout the en tire slate will lie 250 per cent If that estimate Is correct that would make the total assessed valuation next Tear 11000,000,000, Instead of 1800.000, 000. Under the provLslons of the tax rate law then the tax rate on that total as m -soient would ho only 26 cents for all state purposes. figuring on the county alone at the present stale tax rate, the county pays to the stiite this year $78,000. If the Shelby assessment next year Is three times the present, or 1.16,000,000, and the rate 26 eenla, the etiunty would paj state tax of 193,600, or $15,504) more than ilila-year. That w lujd be an increase In che j r 1 1 ... i r 1 1 paid by the county taxpayers alone next year over this of 20 per cent. Hut the taxpayers of the city of Mem phis are likely to pay a still larger pro portion The agents of the state equal ization hoard are Just beginning their work in the city proper. What the In nreased valuations fixed for Memphl, will he, has not yet been determined. However, estimates have been made In those familiar with the work of the sgenls of the stale Iswnl elsewhere, that the increase in the city proper will hi greater than that in the county, pos sibly as much us 360 per cent. That renalna to he seen . The total realty assessment at pres ent for county and city Is around 190,000,000 for state and county pur po.soH There have been estimates nas nrded thai the total assessment under the new taw may go to $300,000,000. Naturally, with (he appraisal not com ni, I. d In the city, and not finally passed upon Jiy the state hoard as to the county proper, nothing but estimates can in' used Nevertheless, If the state hoard's guess at the total state valua tion, given above, is approximately cor rect . which would Indicate a general Increase In Ihe entire state of 260 per i cnt, mid an Increase Is made In Mem phis and Shelby county of 300 to HO P"i cent. It appears that Memphis und Shelby county will sllll be paying a larger proportion of the entire state tsx than their just share, no matter how low Ihe rate may be. Square Deal Demanded. Acting upon a letter, reciting some of these facts, written by W T Condon, state ami county assessor, to William H. Kllxllugh, president of the Cham ber of Commerce, Mr. Kitzllugh Mon day evening called the members of the tas(iin committee of the chamber to gether After a brief conference he authorised BUM 'lutes, chairman, to empty an expert atuiVticlan, who Will be directed to go to NVhvllle nd look over the figures of the new ap praisal In all the counties of the state, and then to visit a number of the counties and make a personal investi gation into the methods used in ar ming at the new valuations, with the view to finding out whether the In i reuses made In Shelby county und con templated in Memphis are in line with the Increases mane In other counties nf the state, particularly those In which Ihe larger cities are located. Mr 'latea and his committee will em ploy the statistician at once, aa It la Imperative that If any Investigation Is done, the work shall be completed aa speedily as possible, so that any com plain that may be filed In the name of Ihe chamber of Commerce shall be made before the figures In Memphis and Shelby county are completed and finally approved Mr Kllxllugh said Tuesday that nethlni hut a square deal Is sought. Inn that every taxpayer In the county should be assured of that and that by gelling the figures and comparisons from other counties It can easily be .nmputed whether or not that Is what Shelby county Is getting. The provisions of the new law are that every piece of rea'tv in the state must hereafter be assessed at its ac tual cash value Tt has been found In many counties that the assessment was anywhere from 10 per cent to not more than 40 per cent of such actual cash value It Is also asld that the increases in Knox. Hamilton snd Pavidson coun ties will be found to be fullv as high as those thus far made in Shelby.
