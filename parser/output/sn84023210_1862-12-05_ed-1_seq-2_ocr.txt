The recent annual incrsage of President Lin coln, although a State paper of the greatest im portance, is so clear aud perspicuous in its statements, history and argument, as to need ttie comment from the pres. The chief pub lic tnterot eentrrs nmurid twn topics discussed n it, viz : the (iminces of the country, and fotnancipatioH. Tiie first of these topics wc have no inclination to discuss now. Of the ',ittr we hare however, a word to s'ay. I: will be rem'.'.uer 'il that Mr. L;ncvl;i, in lis emancipation proclamation in September, tniKvanced bis purpose of present'ng to L'jn gress g:iin tit this titoe, the subject of volun tary, compensated emancipation; and the space devoted to the eu.juct, in the luusage, is in answer to that promise. It is worth while to tnep tiiis in min i, as sjirifi Ihruocratic papeis &rc en 3cavorir,K to persuade their readers that tla message is virtually a retraction of hi proclamation, while in fact it is supplementary to it, idussinij only the question of voluniary tiianciptiiin by States acting in harru 'ny wiili the General 'GjYernrucnt. In this part of the message, we think the argum.-nt for etnanci nation is very plainly, distinctly, and strongly u'gei ; s; well put, indeed, that its logic car t"is ore much byor:d the occlusions ut which (be President seems content to stop. If eman t.;'tiun in 1000 would be productive of hueh linitK'aSUl'fi! Roou, it it? tolerably clear that i mancipation in would start the nation in lliit? career of prosperity neirly twj score yean? sooner, uod would increase its wealth and poj ulaiion. and of coursj its ability to pay any na nonal debt, in a great'y increased ratio. We are aware that sooie tiari may be necess ary for the p3)ple of the Slavs States, 83 far to iititgrow prejudices as to ee that their own true interests, na well as tha peacjand prosperi ty of the nation, appeal for their action i.i this matter. But men think fast in revolutionary tunes, and the recent election in Missouri is a f liiniug example of the progress of ideas since this war commenced. Slavery has already lost it Ktrongeiit defence, the enforced prohibition of the discussion of it evils iti the slave States, uiii ejis are be ins; opened that have long been n utter darkness. Prominent statesmen Irom Texts, Xenneesee, Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri, have borne testimony utjainst it, and tsked for its destruction. And when the pro clamation of the 1st ot January shall supple ment the proclamation of the 22nd of Septem ber, and slavery shall cease to have existence in disloyal territory, we believe it will take but a fhort timo to bnn.; the loyal S'atea which may yet be cursed with the institution, to rid them-t-.dves of it. But the President's plan does not require delay, although it contemplates that proabitiy, and we are persuaded that be will never put obstae en in the way of immediate action anywhere and everj where, as soon as it may be demanded. There is no need now to discuss the practica bility of the plan proposed. There ought to be no objection to it by the loyal slave States, as it leaves the completion of the work entirely to the States ihemhelves. It would now, doubt less, meet stronger objections in New York ttrnong the Fernando Wood Democracy, than in Missouri or Maryland, as it would take Jrom theia their principal political stock m trade. But this is a question for the future It is sufficient for to-dav to know that a Presi dent ot the United States has shown in an an nual menage the necessity for Emancipation. 'Tha method we can discu-is hereaf ter. The discussion in the message, of" iho future of the cmiutcipated slave,'" we regard ue most admirable and unanswerable. lie is attest the i lamor about lioraiigemeijt of labor, and lljoding the North with free blacks in cuse of Emanci pation, and we btdteve no person, unless wil fully akeptical; can lail to ba convinced by its reasoning. And wo ui y add that it is also a most MitlsUctory argument againbt any violent depor tation ot Africans. The earnestness and solemnity of the Presi dent's closing words cannot fail to reach the Iteart of every reader. They deserve to bo writ ten aa the motto of every man who is working to save bis country. Tiey reach far shove and beyond that miserable party, Shibboleth, " tbt Union as it was," and take bold of eternal truths. They are the solemn utterances of trutb and soberness. They hid " The dead pad bnry it dead, Ael, act la tho living present, Heart witain and lit A a'uhead." Read once more those grand and eloquent words : The tenuis of the. quiet past are inadequate to the stormy pi esent. The occasion is piled high with difRcuUv, and tre must rise with the occasion. Jls our case is new, o we must think antir and aet anew. We must disentlwall ourselves, und then we shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress toill be remembered in spite of ours Ives. Ao personal significance or insignifi cance am spare one or another of us. The very trial through when we pass will light us uown in honor or dishinor to the latest generation. We say tie are fur th: Unin. The world will hot fr.rgct , that ithile we say this, we do not k now Uou to save j the Unim. The world knows how to save it. I a' , i 1 1 if it. i. - We, cvin we here, hold the power and hear the re sponsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we as sure freedom to the free honorable, alike in what we gixe and tchal we presence. We shill lwbly save, or meanly lose, the. best hope cf the earth. Olhrr munis may succeed : this could not fail. The way is plant, peaceful, generous and jurl. .1 way whkh, if followed, the world wdl forever applaud and God forever bless. The 'limr" Washington dispatch says tl.e opinion seuus to gain ground that the President designs sending to Congress a supplementary message, wiien it shall be ready to proceed to business, and that there are many reasons why such a communication can be made more satis factorily at that period than at present. - - 4 p -- ...

It is said the private aspersions of Pope upon Sigel will also be investigated. The I'icsident's massaga was p'.iblihfd in San Francisco and Sacramento pap-rs, Wednesday.

Mk Kniron, Will you permit me, through your columns, to -peak of the lectures deliv ered before the Students of Springfield Wes Icyan Seminary and .Female Collegiate In stitute, by licv. fcf. II. Colbaru. His Lecture on E.ewents of National Greatness, ' though not what might be called briiiaut. was logical and deeply interesititig. As a Lecturer, Mr. Colburn is not to his audie-aee ' as a lovely hong of one who has a pleasant voice, and can play well upon an in strumcryt, ' pleasing only the car, for he deals ia thoughts more than in tropes. Tucve who love to tbiak, however, will be highly edified in listening to him. His lecture on ' The "War ' arid' exhibition with Magic Lantern ought to It repeated in every town. The views are fine, and with the lecture, give :t very correct idea of thu 'Great Uebellion.' Perhaps no better raeouiraencks tion can be given it than the fact, that at its second delivery in this place, though the evts nwijj wus very rainy, tke Town Hall was well filled. M. C. Ij:ax.
