In a drunken fight at Yarnvilie, in Hampton county, last Saturday, Howard Mew struck Fuller Bowers a blow, killing him instantly. Mew endeavored to make Ma aaranp hut was shortlv afterwards ar rested and lodged in jail. ? The proprietor of two skating rinks at Reading, Pa., has adopted rules refusing coloredpeople admission to the floor of the rink. This action aroused considerable indignation among the colored citizens, and they threaten to test their rights in the Courts under the Civil Rights Bill. ?There are a great many ways of celebrating a victory, but perhaps the best way is that proposed by the Democrats of Springfield, Mass. They are preparing to buy 500 sacks of flour, on each of which will be printed: "Compliments of the Democratic party," to be distributed to the poor of the city. ? Congressman Folett, of Ohio, proposes to introduce a bill in the House of Representatives at Washington to do away with the use of United States deputy marshals and United States supervisors at the polls, and sflso proposes to have the conduct of these officials at recent elections in Ohio investigated. ? A Chicago dispatch says that the State canvassing Doard decided in the LemanBrand contest that from the testimony given before it, Brand, (Democrat) was not entitled to the certflcate of election. The board referred the matter to Governor Hamilton for final decision. On this decision will depend Logan's re-election to the United States Senate. ? The New York Herald endorses Mr. Conkling for the Senatorship in a rather equivocal manner, thus: "Everybody knows that he is vain as a peacock, but everybody knows also that he has the wisdom of an owl. His experience has shown him his peacock mistakes and taught him the wisdom of the owl, and we believe hini to be a patriot." ? Says the Shelby, N. C., Aurora: The flourishing town of Whitaker, on the Airline Railway is now a subject of litigation. Several parties have laid claim to the possession of Whitaker by virtue of an old deed, and they claim that theirs is the only valid and legal title covering nearly all the land. Yet the people of the place are not much frightened by the suit which began at this term of our Superior Court. ? Mr. Roe, a clerk in the Treasury Department, who acted for a year as private secretary to Gen. Garfield, has placed a claim for $13,000 against the estate in Gen, Butler's hands for collection. Mrs. Garfield has offered Roe $3,000, but he insists on having the whole amount. Friends of the late President hope the matter can be settled without resort to the courtsS. ? H. B. Claflin, the well known merchant of New York city, says: "I can discern a A ! t\ f f **Q rl c greanrupruveiueiinu mcwmuuun vi since it was officially announced that Grover Cleveland is to be our next President. My own business has increased, and I, ol my own personal knowledge, am satisfied that the general condition of trade is much better than one week ago. ? Mrs. John Wattacount, of Oconto, Wisconsin, and her twelve-year-old daughter attempted to walk twelve miles while returning from the funeral of her mother's sister on Saturday last. They lost their way and perished by the severe cold in an extensive swamp surrounding Shawno Lake. The bodies were discovered by searching parties on Sunday afternoon, frozen stiff. ? Adj.-General King has received a letter from Captain Baylor of the frontier troops, giving details of the recent murderous raids on the Upper Rio Grande by a band of hostile Indians. Baylor says the band consists of sixty straggling Apaches and other Indians from New Mexico. He anticipates that these bloodthirsty cut-throats will cause great trouble to Texas unless they are immediately pursued and exterminatkl. ? In Montgomery county, Arkansas, on the 26th ultimo, Julius Robb, a well known fanner, was instantly killed by a meteor which descended through a tall tree, cutting the limbs as clean as though it had been a cannon ball. It.struck Robb on the shoulder, passing through his body obliquely and burying itself in the earth. The meteor, when dug up, was found to be composed ol iron pyrites, round and rough, and about the size of a large tea cup. ? A champion base ball player agreed to take a position in the ranks of a Washington nine, provided a $1,200clerkship in one of the Departments was secured for him, in addition to a $1,300 salary. A correspondent reminds this cheeky athlete that the day for the Government to pay baseball players has passed away. Such things were done during Grant's reign?at one time all the Olympic nine being carried on Department rolls?but those happy days are gone. ? Gen. Logan issaid to be a very poor man, absolutely dependent upon his congressional salarv, which is about to depart from him. The disgrace of a son has fallen heavily upon him. He has been the victim ol sharpers and is now violently wrested from public life. There would be more sympathy for him if he had shown some mercy to Fitz John Porter. The curses he invoked upon Porter have descended upon his own head. He has been caught in "the overflowing scourge." ? In consequence of the protracted drouth, this season's cotton crop is the cleanest ever gathered. The New Orleans Times-Democrat, anent this fact, makes timely remark that British and other manufacturers ought to be at last satisfied that the occasional presence of dirt in American cotton is not a fraud perpetrated by the planters, as they have been wont to pretend, but the result of the weather, and that with a good, dry picking season, such as we have had this year, there will be no cause whatever for complaint. ? There was a grand Democratic demonstration in Atlanta, Ga., last Friday night? the greatest ever seen in Georgia. It is claimed that there were fully 25,000 visitors in the city from all parts of the State. Every town sent a delegation, and the procession was three miles long. Among the distinguished speakers were Hon. Samuel Randal and W. U. Hensel, chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic committee. Randal expressed himself as highly pleased with his visit, and as grateful for the warmth of his reception. He returned from Atlanta direct to Washington. ? Frank Casey, colored, who murdered Charles Watson in Argenta, opposite Little Art in Wpnterriher Inst, was hanced jiivrvn) ???f m -v.. ..? . 7 . .. at Little Rock on Wednesday of last week. He acknowledged stabbing Watson, but pleaded drunkenness and denied intending to kill him. On Friday last, Abe Frazier, colored, was hanged at Warren, Arkansas, for the murder of Lewis Davis, also colored, two years ago* On the gallows he protested his innocence. The execution was witnessed by two thousand persons. ? Judge Tourgee, of the FooVs Frnm<l and some other literary exploits, has always been fond of writing himself "one of the fools," but he probably thinks now that there a more sorrowful truth than playful jest in the description. The judge is going through bankruptcy proceedings at Mayvifie, New York, and trying to arrive at some estimate with regard to his assets. He is represented to be in poor health, and penniless, with no immediate prospects before him. unless his health may be so restored as to enable him to take to the lecturer's field, the paradise of northern literary hacks. ? A Louisville dispatch of Saturday says: Arthur A. Loom is, traveling representative for a New York firm, was in this city tol day, having just returned from a trip 1 through the plague-stricken district of Eastern Kentucky. Loomis said he was four days in Martin county without disposing of "a single article. The people are absolutely crazy. They have no use for anything but coffins. In an interview on this subject he describes in picturesque language the situation as being a great deal worse than \ \ has been heretofore published. He de scribes streams, wells and cisterns as driet up, sheep and cattle dead upon the parchec fields, every human being in the entin 1 neighborhood dead, and thousands of per ; sons perished within a few weeks. Starva j tion, Loomis says, has been the chief ageni " of death in the stricken locality. ! ihc $Jftbvitte ?n<jwrct. 

YORKVILLE, S. (. : i THURSDAY MORNING, DEC. 4,1884. GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. The Governor's message, printed on the first page of this paper, will commend itsel to the citizens of the State as an able, busi ness-like paper, such only as our Governoi 1 submits to the General Assembly. THE WORlf OF*CONGRESS. ' Congress met on Monday last. There i* strong probability that the present sessior will do very little of importance beyono passing the necessary appropriation bills i Of these a greater number are in readines* for the consideration of the sub-committee* of the House committee on appropriation.' ' than have been prepared at so early a dat( for a number of years. These bills includt , estimates for Indians, the army, the navy the military academy, and for the consulai and diplomatic, postoffice and District o ' Columbia appropriations. The member; ( of the appropriations committee are o opinion that one or two of these bills wil 1 be ready to report to the House this week > It has been suggested by a number of th< ; Representatives that Congress take a reces; about the middle of the month to give ar 1 opportunity for the memoers to artenu un J openingof the New Orleans Exposition, arc that during this proposed recess the appro , priations committee will consider the ap . propriation bills, so as to have most of then , ready to report to the House upon the re assembling of Congress after the holidays ' Besides the appropriation bills, there an l' on the calendars of the House of Represen j tatives abut thirteen hundred bills in vari ous stages of incompleteness. They are di vid?d as follows: In committee of the whole, 175; on the house calendar, 155; pri ! vate calendar, 420; Senate bills on seconc 1 or third reading, 480, and about forty oth [ ers reported from the calendars and un [ disposed of, special orders, priviledgec reports and business on the speaker's ta ble. With this formidable array to star on, it will be readily seen that new meas ' ures yet to be introduced will stand a ver} ; poor show of a fair consideration. The ? bills that are pending before the various committees of the house are half as mail} f thousands as these are hundreds. There are two measures of the three upor the speaker's table which are party meas ures, and will provoke debate. These arc ! the Mexican war pension bill and the bil to forfeit certain land grants. These lane i grant measures will be crowded by Mr ' Cobb and other Democrats. Another at tempt will be made to secure legislator looking to the reduction of the surplus ir the treasury. There are three electior cases pending. The Mexican war and lane grant measures are special orders, and, wit! the public building bills, have the right o 1 way, not to interfere with appropriatior bills. The Senate was promptly called to ordei ; at noon, and after prayer by the chaplain ! On motion of Logan, the Secretary was instructed to inform the House of Repre sentatives that a quorum of the Senate hac assembled, and that the Senate was read} , to proceed to business. Sherman and (jar . land were appointed a committee to infornr , the President that the Senate was ready t( receive any communication that he mighi be pleased to make. After a recess of half an hour, the Presi dent's message was received, and the read ing of it was at once proceeded with. , After the message was read, the Senate adjourned. f The House wasalso called to order at noon Only the usual formalities attending the ' first day of the session were observed. Af ter the reading of the President's message t Mr. Aiken, of South Carolina, presented f f resolution declaratory of the sorrow whicl 1 the members experienced at the news of the 1 death of their late colleague, Hon. John H Evins, of South Carolina, and at 2.55, as i mark of respect to the deceased, the House adjourned. I THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. j The President's message was read before both houses of Congress last Monday. It i: 1 a very lengthy and withal an able State paper. As much of its contents, however can be of but little interest to the genera reader, we have decided to print only j synopsis. He opens by saying: When it is remembered that at no perioc in the country's history has the long politi ail contest which customarily precedes the ; day of the national election been wagec with greater fervor and intensity, it is * , subject of general congratulation that, aftei the controversy at the polls was over, anc ; j while the slight preponderance by whicl j the issue had been determined was as ye i i unascertained, the public peace suffered nc ! disturbance, but the people everywhere j patiently and quietly awaited the result Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the . temper of the American citizen?his lov< ; of order and his loyalty to law; nothing , could more signally demonstrate th( j strength and wisdom of our political insti : tutions. i j Eight years have passed since acontro I versy concerning the result of a nationa election sharply called the attention of tin Congress to the necessity of providing inort i precise and definite regulations for counting 1 the electoral vote. It is of the gravest importance that this question be solved before conflicting claims to the Presidency shal again distract the country, and I am per I suaded that, by the people at large, any o | the measures of relief thus far proposed j would be preferred to continued inaction. , | -Much space is uevoieu u> me muuuns u, this Government wfth foreign powers which continue to be amicable. He next refers to the national finances the condition and operations of which an ,! ably discussed in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. From this report it ap 1 pears that the ordinary revenues for tin fiscal year ended June 30,1884, were: From customs, $195,0G7,480.70; from inter nal revenue, $121,580,072.51; from all othei ! sources, $81,800,807.05; total ordinary reve nues, $348,519,809.92. The public expend! tures during the same period were: for civi | expenses, $22,312,907.71; for foreign inter course,$1,200,700.37; for Indians, $0,475,999. 29; for pensions, $55,429,228.00; for the mili tary establishment, including river ant harbor improvements and arsenals, $39,429, > 603.30; forthe naval establishment, including vessels, machinery and improvements a ; navy yards, $17,292,001.44; for miscellaneou! !1 expenditures, including public buildings light houses and collecting revenues, $43, i 939,710.00; for expenditures on account o the District of Columbia, $3,407,049.02 for interest on the public debt, $54,578, 378.48; for the sinking fund, $46,790,229.50 total ordinary expenditures, $290,910,473.83 ; leaving a surplus of $57,603,396.09. As com ; pared with the preceding fiscal year, there s was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 ir ' the amount of expenditures. The aggregate -1 receipts were less than those of the year i I; previous by about $54,000,000. The falling: I ' off in revenue from customs made nearly i $20,000,000 of this deficiency, and about $23, 000,000 of the remainder was due to the di- , -1 minished receipts from the internal taxat! tiqp. The President concurs with the Secretary j ! of the Treasury in recommending the immediate suspension of the coinage of silver ' dollars and the issuance of silver certificates. He discusses his reasons at length, and then refers to the excise taxes as follows: In my annual message of 1882,1 recomj mended the abolition of all excise taxes ex! cept those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished, revenues that will remain to the Government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem advisable when the results of recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions can he most judiciously effected. After reviewing our shipping interests P and devoting considerable space to the War and Navy Departments, he refers to the ' Postoffice Department as follows: The report of the Postmaster General acquaints you with the present condition and needs of the postal service. It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from 3 the reduction in#the rate of letter postage ? recommended in "my message of December I 4,1882, and effected by the act of March, 3, 1883, has been much less than was general' ly anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction 5 was based upon the belief that the actual 3 falling off in receipts from letter postage for i the year immediately succeeding the change n i of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,275,000. This is a trustworthy in' dication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former volume by the natural ' increase of sealed correspondence. I con3 fidently repeat therefore, the recommendaf tion of my last annual message, that the sin1 gle rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wherever the payment of [ two cents is now required by law. The ' double rate is now only required at offices 3 where the carrier system is in operation, i and it appears that at all these offices the 3 increase in the tax upon local letters defrays 1 the cost not only of its own collection and delivery but of the collection and delivery of all other mail matter. This is an ine" quality that ought no longer to exist. I i approve the recommendation of the Post master General that the unit of weight in rating of first class matter should be one j ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the Department, it may well be considered - whether the change would result in any - loss of revenue. That it would greatly pro3 mote the convenience of the public, is be. yond,'dispute. 1 Of the department of justice the Presi. ident says: The Attorney General renews the recom, mendation contained in his report of last year touching the fees of witnesses and ju' rors. He favors radical change in the fee t bill, the adoption of a system by which at torneysnnd marshals of the United States r shall be compensated solely by salaries, and > the erection by the government of a peni' tentiary for the confinement of offenders 5 against the laws: In reviewing the Department of the Interior for the past year, in which is in1 eluded the Territorial governments in the Union, he makes the following reference ; to the Mormon question : J The report of the Utah Commission will 1 be read with interest. It discloses the re. suit of the recent legislation looking to the - prevention and punishment of poligamy in i that Territory. I still believe that if that j abominable practice can be suppressed by law, it can only be by the most radical leg1 islation consistent with the restraint of the ? Constitution. I again recommend, therei fore, that Congress assume absolute politicf al. control of the Territory of Utah, and x provide for the appointment of a Commission with governmental powers as in its judgment may justly and wisely be put : into their hands. After eulogizing the civil service system, 5 recommending the early enactment of a " bankrupt law by Congress, and also recom' Tnending that Congress confer upon Gen. 7 Grant a suitable pension, the message con" eludes as follows: 1 Certain of the measures that seem to me ) necessary and expedient, 1 have now, in t obedience to the Constitution, recommended for your adoption. As respects others of no less importance, I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations already made to the Congress, without relating the grounds upon which such reeom} mendations were based. The preservation of forests on the public domain, the granting of Government aid for popular educaj tion, the amendment of the Federal Consti' tution so as to make effective the disap* proval by the President of particular items ? in appropriation bills, the enactment of i Statutes in regard to the filling of vacan- j i cies in the Presidential office and the deter- i 3 mining of vexed questions respecting Pres-' idential inability, are measures which may ; justly receive your serious consideration. 1 As the time draws nigh when I am to re-1 J tire from public service, I cannot refrain j from expressing to the members of the National Legislature with whom 1 have been brought into personal and official inj tercourse, my sincere appreciation of their ^ unfailing courtesy and of their harmonious co-operation with the Executive in so J many measures calculated to promote the > best interests of the nation!; and to my fel1 low citizens generally I acknowledge a deep i sense of obligation for the support which ; they have accorded me in my administra- j tion of the Executive Department of this Government. Death ok Mil. Rich a an Tozek.?'The : t many friends of Mr. Richard Tozer will | f learn with exceeding sorrow of his untimely j | death, which occurred about (> o'clock last ! , evening. Some five or six weeks ago Mr. j ^ lozer met wiui ii vci^ 

9CMUU3 uktiucnv i?i , being thrown from a wagon by a runaway i ? horse, and lie never entirely recovered from his injuries, though the immediate cause I ! of his death was pneumonia, after ten days j 1 of illness. r The deceased was an estimable citizen, | \ a master of his business, and was well i known throughout the State. He was born j near London, in which city he became a ; . skilled machinist. He came to America in j I early life, and in the latter part of 18.">2 took j , up his residence in Columbia, where he was ! > engaged in the machinery department of i. the State I louse work. Upon the suspension 1 of this work he was elected Superintendent ; of the Water Works in this city. AttheexI pi ration of his term of office he entered into 1 . business for himself, on Lady street near f Assembly. After the war, Mr. Tozer found ; [ it necessary to enlarge his business facili- j ties, and hence lie occupied the premises on ! C Washington street which have been fainil-; iarly known as the Sword Factory. Dias- j > ter overtook Mr. Tozer in this last enter-j prise and the business was taken in charge , by Mr. George Dial. From this time for- | ? ward Messrs. Dial it Tozer progressed in j T business with such success as to make their ! names familiar in this and adjoining States. ! " The deceased married the sister of Mr. j i George L. Dial, who survives him, but he left no children. Mr. Tozer was about 54 ; - years of age. He was an enterprising ousir ness man, a progressive citizen and an ener getic assistant in all public movements. He j - had been a prominent member of the State : 1 Agricultural Society. He was a bright Ma- j - son, and will be missed from the fraternity > - as well as frotrl the private walks of life, j -1 He was also a member of the Knights of I Honor.?Columbia Jlegtiter, 30fh. * j Nkw Jt'DiciAii Ciiut'its.?There will II come up before the present session of the 5 General Assembly, in some shape or other, , ! a bill to organize two new Judiciary Cir-1 cuits in this State. For years there has f been a constant cry that the present arrange; inent of our judicial system is wholly inad equate to the demands of the business. ! ; This bill is intended to meet this demand. ; In all probability it will provide for the I - formation of two new Circuits. We do not 3 doubt that the blatant cry will be raised I i of the creation of new and unnecessary ? offices. Hut any lawyer who has any prae-' tice knows this is not true. Many a liti-1 gant in this county has had the adjudication of his rights so long postponed by the "the law's slow delay," that when at length the relief came, it was more costly than it was worth. There is a case now pending in ! the Court of Common Pleas for this county, in which a cloud of witnesses on both sides have been kept in attendance on term after term of the court and the case has not yet come to trial. At the October term of the court for Abbeville the Sessions business consumed more than half the time of the court, leaving scarcely three days for the hearing of all the civil cases on the dockets. We are of opinion that the plan proposed will meet our wants better than any other. It will not necessitate a complete reformation of the judicial arrangements; but leaving the Trial Justice system as it is, divide Hit> >>iKnr< r>f tlio liio-lidr /vuirtej nmnnf niOTO .Judges.

Correspondence of the Yorkville Knquirer. 

FROM THE STATE CAPITAL. Columbia, December 1.?The present session of the Legislature promises to be a very quiet one. The absence of long winded talkers, especially in the house, is quite apparent. There seems to me to be an unusual number of young men in the House; but to their credit they do not seem disposed to talk on all occasions, as is generally the case with young members. The most important matters to be considered, this session, are the questions of a change in the mode of assessment and collection of taxes and that1 of continuing the work on the Columbia Canal. The present system of assessment of property in this State is generally conceded to be unjust and unequal, inasmuch as it does not secure equality of taxation betweert counties, nor even 'among townships of the same counties, as the Comptroller's report shows. To illustrate the inequality of the assessments between the counties, take for examDie. the counties of York and Lancaster, as they lie contiguous to each other. A record of the lands sold at public sale in York county duringthe past year shows that they were assessed on the auditor's books at 81 per cent, of what they sold for, while in Lancaster county they were assessed at only 25 per cent, of what they brought at public sale. In the matter of personal property the present system gives results equally as unjust. The average value of mules in Laurens county is ?48; in York it is $73.50. It requires no argument to show that a system which gives such results as these needs amendment, and I think our Legislature will make an effort to remedy the system. The present system of collecting taxes upon an assessment made the year previous gives our people greatdissatisfaction, and an effort will be made to have the assessment for May 1885 dispensed with, and the assessment made in the Spring of 1886, so as to bring the assessment within the same year as the collection of taxes and have the books for the collection of taxes open from the 1st of October to the 1st of December. This would, I think, be much more satisfactory and convenient to the tax-payers. The probabilities are that the Legislature will put a stop to the expenditure of money on the Columbia Canal, as soon as it can be done without losing to the State wind; has been expended. The proposition, which seems to meet with most favor, is to construct a dam across the Congaree at the point to which the canal is now completed and let the water into the canal at this point, which it is thought will give ample power to run all the machinery necessary to employ the convicts within the walls of the Penitentiary, and thus stop any further extension of the canal. Both Houses have gone industriously to work, and ?.11 signs point to a short, laborious session. J. G. n. Correspondence of the Yorkvflle Enquirer. 

LETTER FROM CHESTER. Chester, December 2, 1884.?Our town was visited with a destructive lire on last Tuesday night. Shortly after dark tire broke out in the warehouse of W. II. Kosborough, and before the firemen succeeded in extinguishing it, the building, with all its contents, consisting of cotton, cotton seed, corn and oats, were entirely consumed. Ninety bales of cotton were burnt, of which sixty-one belonged to Mr. T. N. Youngblood, twenty-eight to Mr. J. Smith, and one to Mr. J. S. Wilson. Youngblood's cotton was covered by insurance, Smith's and Wilson's were not. Mr. W. H. Jtosborough had his warehouse insured for SI,000, but he lost a large lot of corn, oats and cotton seed, upon which there was no insurance. The colored fire engine company rendered valuable service, as it was in a great measure due to their efforts that the Marshall House was saved. Had the wind been blowing in the direction of this house, it would doubtless have taken fire and met with the same fate of the warehouse. The burning of this hotel would have led to the destruction of other buildings on Main street. Different opinions are entertained in regard to the origin of the fire. On the same night of the fire the prisoners in jail made their escape. They effected an opening in the wall, and then let themselves down to the ground by means of blankets. H. C. Syler, colored, was in jail charged with selling intoxicating liquors in violation of law, and was to have been tried at the March term of the United States Court at Greenville. He is supposed to be on his way back to Dallas, N. C., as he came from that place. James Jeems, colored, was in jail charged and convicted of the crime of stealing corn from the field. George Good, colored, was in jail charged with bigamy. The persons will hardly be recaptured, as they are by this time doubtless a long distance from this place. It is thought that the jail delivery has some connection* with the fire, as the latter might have been started to divert attention from the jail. Thanksgiving day was very well observed at this place. Business was almost entirely suspended. Union services were held at the Methodist church. The ministers of all the churches were present, and took some part in the service. Hev. G. A. Summey preached an appropriate sermon from the text, "And be ye thankful." In enumerating the blessings which would fill our hearts with gratitude he referred to the deliverance of our people at the time of the cyclone, and to the beautiful temples of worsliip which had replaced the plain churches damaged or destroyed by the storm. A goodly number of our young men expressed their gratitude for the multitude of mercies past by indulging in a hunt in the afternoon. On Thursday night our town was again alarmed by the cry of fire. The goods in the store of Messrs Hood & Chambers took fire in some unknown way, but fortunately it was discovered and extinguished before much damage was done. The loss, which amounted to about two hundred dollars, was covered by insurance. Br. David Lysle sustained a serious injury 011 last Wednesday morning from the hoofs of a fractious horse. In the effort of the Doctor to quiet the animal, it reared and viciously pawed him, breaking his left arm and otherwise injuring him. He was . . x a,... i at,. Oil nis Wily lib UlU UIIJO III uic imunc >fi 1.11, I Robert Key, whose child was dangerously ill and afterwards died. A colored child was burnt to death near LowrysvilJe in thiscounty, on last Thursday night. The parents had gone to church, and left the child alone in the house. The house in some unknown way taking fire, was consumed, together with the child, aged about six years. The "powers that be" should take the necessary steps of stopping the criminal habit of colored people of leaving their children alone in houses. The colored man that was shot by Mr. Dunlap at Fort Lawn, a few day ago, is getting well. Sales-day brought a large number of peo- j pie to our town yesterday. The demand for j lanVl was not very lively. The price ranged from $;] to ?21 per acre. The Chisholm plantation on Rocky Creek, considered a lino place, only brought $7.7"> per acre. Mules were sold at a sacrifice. Mr. W. T. Love, of this county, lost by fire a few nights ago his cotton house with three bales of cotton. M. ' LOCAL AFFAIRS. !'< - j ? NEW ADVERTISEMENTS. b J. C.

Walker, who owns a one-horse farm one mile west of town, has shown us a statement of his farming operations for the past year, from which it appears that his net profits amount to ?<><>8.58. As those who know the Doctor are fully aware, he farms on strictly methodical principles, and as the result must he satisfactory to him, while it should be encouraging to others, with his consent we print below the items of his profit aiul expense account: 7,20!) pounds cotton, raised on 18 acres, $071 01 480 bushels cotton seed 88 80 000 bushels oats, on ten acres 380 00 200 bushels corn, on six acres 150 00 l,f>00 bundles fodder > 22 51 44 bushels wheat, on four acres 39 00 $1,332 51 At the following expense? 1,000 bushels cotton seed ?150.00 2 tons acid phosphate 40.00 1 regular hand and his board 180.00 Extra labor 75.00 Horse and feed 100.00 Picking cotton 108.93 blacksmith account 10.00?^ 003 93 Net profit ?008 58 ; The Doctor's mode of planting cotton was by broadcasting stubble land with cotton seed last December. The seed was turned under with a two-horse plow, and the acid phosphate applied a at planting time. The subsequent cultivation of the crop was by the customary method. c C THE CONDEMNED PRISONER. On Saturday last a representative of the KxQi'iiiKK, accompanied by Major J. E. Hart, of ^ counsel for Columbus C'ranford, in jail under sentence of death for the murder of Ellison San- r ders, visited the condemned man for the purpose of receiving any statement that he might ? see proper to make for publication. The prison- e er was led from his cell, pn the third story of the jail, to the ante-room on the same floor. He ap- ^ peared calm and collected. He is of medium ? height, though stout and thickly set; about forty p years of age, and of light yellow complexion. ? On the object of our visit being made known to s him by Major Hart he expressed his willing- ( ness to make a statement. Major Hart admon- b ished him that lie need entertain no hope of p clemency from any earthly power, and suggest- ,S ed that the statement he was about to make would probably be the last he would have the e opportunity of making before he ascended the g gallows, and as nothing could now be gained by 0 concealing any facts, he advised him to tell all he l) knew of the alliiir. The prisoner then made the <> [ followiugstatcment, which was taken down substantially in his own words: J1 I, Columbus Cranford, convicted at the Octoher term, 1884, of the Sessions Court of York C county, South Carolina, of the murder of Ellison Sanders, feeling tiiat I cannot make my peace e with my Maker, without lirst giving' a full ! y statement of my knowledge of the murder, make the following statement. The statement I here make is my most solemn asseveration, and may be the last public statement that I will ever have to make. G On Friday, the 2!Uh day of August, 1884, Klli- H son Sanders waylaid (tiles Good, when passing i ii on the road to Jim Good's about three miles below McNeel's store in York county, and shot at him, as was supposed, intending to kill him. The ball grazed Tiis forehead. Sanders was arrested and was examined before Trial Justice Good on the J.'tth of September following and was discharged. On the next day, Sunday the il 14th, there was a religious meeting at Hopewell S Church. Giles Good had also been arrested for drawing a gun on Sanders, previously to San- C( ders shooting him. Good was under bond for L his appearance before a trial justice in Chester j l< county, the alleged ollence having been com- | e: mitted in that county. ; t( At Hopewell Church on the day above named, I ^ the colored people there assembled were much | h excited over the shooting of Giles by Ellison j tl and the fact that Ellison had been discharged. The general sentiment as expressed among them | .. was that if the law would not punish him for his j " crime, the people should take hold of it, as he was deemed by the colored people of the community to be a dangerous man, and ought not to 1' be allowed to go at large. Giles Good was at this C meeting, but went on to Chester next day and j; after examination before Trial Justice Darby was committed to jail for the otlencc of drawing .. his gun 011 Sanders. I 1 Wallace Reid and Ed. Tiglor, Good's bonds-1 men, accompanied him to Baton Rouge, Chester 11 county, and on the same evening Wallace Reid I sent for me to go to (tiles Good's house to see him. On going there he said to me privately, 11 "Can't we do something for this young man, I t, (meaning Sanders) and not allow him to go j about shooting people." He said that (tiles had j ' asked him to seo me, and he wanted to hear | ?. what I had to say about it, as the law would not s| do anything with Sanders, because we were all I tl arkeys and he thought we ought to take hold f thocaso. I replied that it would lie a hard pill j )r me to swallow, tQ undertake to kill my own ! lood relation. lie answered that he did not ispute that, but he wished to know what I 'ouhi say about it. lie said I was not obliged ! i kill him myself, but as I knew all about the eighborliood here, all he wanted was for me to *11 him about the situation and the people there nd he would go for him. lie wanted to know | rhether or not I would keep the secret, as he Aid there would be enough to attend to him cithout me, though he wanted to know if I could agree to such arrangement and keep the ecrot, He said: "I am willing to go for him i-night, but as I am tired I will go home and ome back this way to-morrow night." On Saturday night previously, as we were , eturning from the trial justice's, (Jnav Tigler lade a similar proposition to me. I replied in bout the same manner as I subsequently did to i Vallaco Keid that I could not take part in kill- j ng my own relation. I and Tigler, however, id go to Ellison's house that night, taking our i uns, but his house was locked, and there was ,o one at his home. !>?!.! . ? T..r>urlo*r i Witllttcc ivnu nunc lu IIIJ nwunu uu a uvouii(? . light, bringing with him a gun which he had ot at Quay Tigler's house, the gun belonging to iiles Gooil. He asked me if I would go down nd show him Ellison Sanders' house, he being stranger in that neighborhood. I took my gun nd went with him to Ellison Sanders' house, ie was at home, and two or three other men, icsides his wife, were there. We did not go in ; inding a crowd there we left without letting ny one know of our presence. He then said, rlicn we separated on that night, that he would eturn back down that way the next night and hat he would probably ride. He left his gun in nv cotton house, giving as a reason that he did lot wish to be seen carrying it about with him. )n Wednesday night, according to his intention xpressed to me, lie returned to my house, ridng. The moon was shining brightly, and my rife was much concerned about ine.'so that on ccount of the brightness of the night, and the act that my wife was exercised about my movenents, and not wishing to excite her, we did not ttenint to go to Ellison's house 011 that night. On leaving my house that night, he said he could leaye his gun at my house, and if Quay 'igler should call for it, to let him have it. He aid, now is the time that we must get Ellison ; hat his blood was warm, and that he was itching or him. On Sunday following, near my house, I met vith Junius Thomson, whose name had been iroposed to me by Quay Tigler. Junius was ery anxious to go into the matter. I asked hinius what he thought of the idea of a man ying in the bushes for the purpose of shooting t another. He replied that he thought Ellison >ught to be killed. During this time I met with iuay Tigler frequently and he always expressed he opinion that Ellison ought to be killed, vhile I argued with him that I thought the law night to take its course in the matter. On Saturday before Ellison was killed I sent riles Good's son John to Trial Justice Lewis, in forkville, with memoranda for the prosecution if Ellison Sanders for shooting at Giles Good; >liver Hobbins for carrying concealed weapon ; ind Wilkes Kobbins for malicious mischief, ['rial Justice Lewis referred all these cases to ['rial Justice Good. On Sunday night Ellison was shot not far from ny house, while he was in company with Junils Thomson, Wilson Kobbins and Oliver Rob_ r . 1 ...1 mis. i wan Mining in my yarn wueu mu auui?, ive in number, were tired. I heard them all listinctly. I did not fire either of these shots; vas not present with those who did fire them; itul I doueelare emphatically and solemnly that had no further connection with the affair than uoh as has been detailed above. I have a belief as to who tired the fatal shot, jut no positive information as to which one of leveral persons did it. W. ('.
