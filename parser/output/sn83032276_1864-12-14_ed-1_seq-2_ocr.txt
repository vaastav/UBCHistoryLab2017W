Wo have thus far made no change in subscription, hut we will of necessity be compelled vcrv shortly to discontinue n't in arrears, no matter how short a time, commencing with those farthest back, as we cannot pay 2 cents for each white sheet of paper and then furnish it printed at 3 cents per copy on credit. Those therefore who will not receive their paper hereafter can readily assign a reason. Up to the past few months it made but Rule difference whether our old patrons were punctual to a week or even months, but our expenses are now too heavy to lie trifled with.

Postponement of Militia Appeals— | -Notice of Provost Marshal—List of Letters. Evil Coansels. Our remarks respecting the creation of thieves and robbers by evil counsels soein to have touched some others of the patent democracy besides the model of the Selinsgrove Times. The last Dem ocrat flies up, pronounces our assertion a cool piece of effrontery, and then asks where is the law for confining citizens in the forts, exiling others, for trying men charged with treason or conspira cy by a military commission, &c.? To all this stuff we answer that the Democrat is doing precisely what we charged, for when it states there is no taw for these things it is deceiving the ignorant and all of its readers who do not know better. The Constitution itself provides that the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended in cases of invasion or rebellion, and whenever it is so suspended military law, as recog nized the world over, takes the place of civil law. Will the Democrat pre tend to say there is no rebellion in the I. nited States '. If there is. any man of common sense who will read the constitution and who knows what the suspension of the writ of habeas cor- i pus means, must know that any of- j fence whatever against military law, no matter in what part of the United i .States it is committed, is amenable to that law. io illustrate this, let us take, the case of a horse thief, a burglar, or an incendiary. For stealing a horse from acitizen, robbing him ofhis goods, or firing his premises, ho is subject to the civil law; but il an army horse be stolen, government army goods ta ken, or government property burnt or destroyed, the offender can be as legally and constitutionally tried, convicted and hung within an hour by a military commission as by the slow process of Judge and jury under the civil law. The satue thing extends to other matters. If an editor pub lishes information of the movements of troops which would enable the ene my to counteract or defeat such move ments, such editor can be arrested and i punished by the commanding officer without resort to the civil law. As a general thing copperhead speakers have endeavored to create the impres sion that military law cannot he exer cised outside the lines of an army, but where do they find the law for such an assertion? The clause in the constitu tion is broad and sweeping: it fixes no limit as to place or territory, and the reason is plain. The suspension of the writ was intended to prevent aid and comfort being given to insurrectionary districts by persons outside of the in surrection. Even at the present day there is abundant evidence to prove that rebel emissaries are scattered over the north by thousands, ready to commit any act of villainy, and that we have men so debased as to aid them. To try such by civil law would be a mockery of justice. The Democrat and its kindred sheets may not regard the declarations of too many self-styled democratic papers that the war laws passed by Congress are not binding on the people, that they ought to be resisted, &c., as evil counsels, but to our mind they are. as such counsels seldom end with a disre gard of that one law, for a code once broken through will find ready justifi cation for the infraction of others. Finally, we do not know that we can better convict the Democrat of incul cating false principles than by copying the following from the same number in which it sets itself up as the defend er of the law. Here is its sayso: Wm. J. Freeburger was arrested veeterday afternoon, charged with cursing President Lincoln. —[ Baltimore Sun of Saturday.] Thus we go. Where is the law for such an arrest? After a while no one will be allow ed to express any opinion that does not chime with the notions of king Abraham !—Letcw totcn Democrat. These little items show to what lengths opposition to the government in the name of democracy will go.— Any one but a winding politician read ing the paragraph in the Sun would think it far more likely the man was arrested for 

CURSING, rather than for Abraham Lincoln's sake, but the Dem ocrat, far more anxious to depreciate Abraham Lincoln than to publish a simple fact, tells the ignorant man in effect that it is an outrage — that there is no law for it —and that the profane swearer is a highly oppressed and deep ly injured man for being arrested ! It sowing such seed is not "evil counsel," what is it? Let the editor of that pa per reflect a little on such items as we have quoted above, as well as oth ers in his paper, and if he does not come to the conclusion that their ten dency is evil, he must arrive at cause and effect by some incomprehensible logic as yet unknown to common people. The truth is orderly und peaceable citizens have no more to fear from mil itary than civil law. The arrival of the released prisouers at Anuapolis was a scene long to be renieui bered. One poor fellow was as full of lite as though he had just oooie into the pos session of a gold mine; he had suffered long from the scurvy. He was so happy to be once more among friends that, as he ex pressed it while he sat on the wharf wait ing to he removed. "I think my mind has all left me, for I now have a strange lancy that I'm in God's oountry, and yet I'm loth to believe it." Being asked what kind of a country he had been in, he replied: "Ah, and be sure, my friends, if the Devil reigns anywhere or owns a foot of soil in God's world, it is in the Confederacy. It is sure ly a God forsaken territory." His limbs were not larger toward the ankle than a man's thumb. It was touching as well as amusing to the bystanders to hear their re marks as they came off the boat. One man, when he reached the wharf coming from the gangway, jumped up and stamp ing with bis feet, uttering the expression as though it came from his very soul: "God bless the piece of land that I'm now on." Another: "Thank God I'm in His country once more." Others would utter like exclamation of joy and gratitude, such as "Oh, what a blessed hour is this!" "Hurrah for the I nion, I'm once more in it! "fourteen months in Dixie, but never a day more .' An Irishman, as he walked off, said : "Sure this is the happiest day since iver I came to Ameriky." Lincoln's official majority in Penn sylvania is 20,081. —Gold has gone up in Ilichmond. It is now at a premium of 4,000 per cent., or forty dollars for one. having advanced since the defeat of the peace candidate at the North for the Presi dency from about 2,400 percent, to its present figuro. —Wo learn from the report of the Secretary of the Navy, that the naval force of the government at this time is composed of 671 vessels of war mostly steam vessels—carrying 4710 guns, manned by 51,000 men° This includes a few vessels now in course of construction, and which will be rcadv for service in a few months. uesda}* hist there were brought from the Baltimore jail to the crinii nal Court, four colored persons, one male, and three females. They had been imprisoned on the charge of be ing run-away slaves. The judge told them they were free to go where they listed, henceforth and forever. —The Electoral College of Pennsyl vania assembled at Harrisburg on N\ ednesday last. Morton McMichael Esq., was chosen President. John \Y istar was absent, and J. B Clark was substituted. The vote was then cast for Lincoln and Johnson. The P k 7 . o i' he electoi ' 8 > amounting to about 8800, was voted to the Christian Commission.

Major General Dana in a successful ! expedition from Vicksburg destroyed the Mississippi Central railroad for thirty miles, and a bridge. He also I found the enemy and returned with 2500 bales of cotton, having destroyed more than a quarter of a million dol ■ lars' worth of rebel property. 1 The net loss by the Franklin battle ' is now stated at CI officers and 854 ; men. The gunboats which went down the river on the 9th have not yet re !turned. Nashville dispatches state that there is no change in the situation ot affairs about the city. Skirmishing is con tinued in front of 4th Corps. General Burbridgo and command were at Bean's station, in East Tennessee, at last ac counts. Army of the Potomac advices state that on Wednesday morning, the sth Corps, a division of the 2d Corps, and two brigades of Gregg's cavalry, went south. They were subsequently heard j from and had crossed the Nottoway ! river, on the Jerusalem road, without ! opposition. On Thursday afternoon, a reconnoitering party of cavalry went i out on the left and encountered the | rebel pickets on the Yaughan road, i The rebels were driven to Hatcher's ! Hun, where they had breastworks, i After some skirmishing the party re- I turned, with a loss of seven men. It | was reported that firing was heard in ; the direction of Stony Creek, and War ! ren was supposed to be fighting the ! enemy. Another reconnoisance towards ; Hatcher s Hun. was made on Friday : morning by a force consisting of de- I tachinonts from several cavalry rci > ments. The enemy's videttes were driven across the run, and the rebel works on the opposite side were car ried. The enemy is believed to have fallen back to Arrrstrong's Mills, a stronger position, a mile and a half west. Late rebel papers report that Sher man captured all the powder of Geor gia and 30U0 stand of arms at Milledge ville; that Grant has been reinforced jby from 0000 to 10,000 men; that the | Hutch Gap canal can be made ready in a few hours; that the Union troops ; have effected a lodgment between Fort | Darling and the Howlett House; that j Gen. Sheridan and his cavalry appeared jat Fredericksburg on Wednesday; i that resolutions in favor of sending peace commissioners to Washington have been introduced into the North Carolina Legislature. Detachments of Colorado cavalry had a fight with the Indians near Fort Lyon recently, and killed between 400 and 500, including several chiefs. The Qaartermaßter General has is sued orders prohibiting the employ merit of any persons who, within the past six months, have been living in Canada as refugees from the disloyal States. This is done in consequence of information of a plot to destroy government stores, transports, &e. Returned prisoners at Annapolis rc j port having seen women and children. | with guns in their hands, in the trench |es about Savannah. The Baltic has i arrived at Annapolis with another batch of starved prisoners. Twenty nine died on the passage, two while being removed, two immediately after removal and four since. Detroit is again excited in conse quence of information of preparations j by rebel refugees in Canada, for a raid ;on the city. Vigorous measures are being taken for the protection of the city. Gen. Sherman at last accounts was within a few days march of Savannah —Some fighting had occurred at Mur freesboro, Tennessee, between Rosseau and tlio rebels. Various movements I are in progress along the coast, but we | know too little to hazard predictions ; as to their results. —Lord Lyon's horses, carriages and ! liquors were sold at Washington on | Saturday. —20,000 tons of coal belonging to the Brooklyn Gas company, were on I fire at New York on Saturday. —Seven or eight inches of snow fell on Friday night, followed by high winds and severe cold. This morning another inch of snow has been added. —Joseph Segar arid J. C. Underwood have been elected U. S. Senators for Virginia by the legislature at Alexan dria. * —Three Lieutenants of Lee's army were tried in court lately for parading j ; tho streets, arm in arm, with negro | I women. This paragraph will hardly I appear in tho True Democrat, i —By the use of small type we eom | press the President's Message into a I small space in to-day's paper. It is a plain, sensible document, well worth perusal. —Congress ought to enact a law that in case of any future drafts no man ; shall be credited out of the district in which he is enrolled, and to disfranchise deserters who do not report after being drafted from all rights of citizenship. —The great speculating feature of the country at present is in coal oil lands, and the fever seems to be spread ing with moms multicaulis rapidity. Where oil exists to any extent, of; course it will pay, but the chances are j that in four easos out of six money will j be lost by embarking in the business on the strength of new discoveries by I speculating companies and individuals. : I.adies' and Children's Hats.

IN order to secure the assistance and eo'op eration of the people in the endeavor to keep the enrollment list continually correct, the Enrolling Board has been directed to have copies of said list kept open to the EX' ainination of the public at all proper times, and shall give public notice that any person may appear before the Board and have any name stricken off the list, if he can show, to the satisfaction of the Board, that the person named is not properly enrolled, on account of— 1. Alienage; 2. Non residence ; 3. Over age ; 4 Permanent physical disability, of such degree as to render the person not a proper subject for enrolment under the law and reg ulations; 5. Having served in the military or naval service two years during the present war and been honorably discharged. Especially ctvil officers, clergymen, and all prominent citizens are invited to appear at all times before the Board to point out errors in the lists, and to give such information in their possession as may aid in the correction ; and revision thereof They should understand that it is plainly | for the interest of ea h sub district to have | stricken from the lists all names improperly j enrolled, because an excess of names increases j the quota called for from each sub district ; ' ; and that it is equally for the interest of each ! person enrolled in a given sub district, to j place upon the lists all persons in the sub dis I trict liable to do military duty, because the | greater lhe number to be drawn from, the I less the chance that any particular individual : | will be drawn. IT is the personal interest of ! every enrolled man that the quota in which J he is concerned shall not be made too large, | and that his own chances for draft shall not I be unjustly increased ; both these objects will ; be attained if all parties will aid in striking 1 out the wrong names and putting in the right I ones. Especially is this the interest of those drafted men who by putting in substitutes themselves liable to draft, have secured ex- 1 J emption which by the terms of the law holds good only until the present enrollment is ex hausted in their sub districts Men who are J over 45 years of age, and in consequence ex | cused by law from the performance of duty ! in the field, owe it to the cause and the coun try to take a zealous and active part in the ! correction of the enrolment lists, a military service of the first importance. The law re ; quires that the quotas shall be assigned in | proportion to the enrolment, and the fairness ' and justice of this mode of determining the j amount of military service due from each and j every section of the country cannot be doubt ; ed if the enrolment is made as nearly perfect as it is practicable to make it. The amount ■ of service due to the nation from every town ' or county, is thus laid fairly and plainly be fore the citizens, and it is expected that a higher motive than a selfish interest will prompt all to do their 6hare in perfecting the J enrolment and securing a just and efficient execution of the laws for raising troops, wher ever it becomes necessary to apply them By order Maj. R. I.
