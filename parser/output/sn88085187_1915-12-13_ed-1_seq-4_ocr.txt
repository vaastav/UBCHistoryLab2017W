PAGE FOTTB EDITORIAL PAGE—Let the Truth Prevail! President Wilson Neglects and President Wilson in his interesting message ignored three important issues that possess the hearts and minds of the people—preparedness against war trusts at home, equality of political freedom, and federal prohibition of the manufacture, sale and importation of intoxicating* beverages. He said much about preparedness to meet the aggression of foreign foes, and recommended the ex* penditure of hundreds of millions for it, but nothing about preparedness against the domestic foes who have furnished rotten armor for battleships and robbed the nation, year after year, by combines and extortionate prices. Underlying the matter of preparedness is a mighty question of national policy. Shall adequate defense of the nation be at the mercy of private corporationsf Or, shall the nation build its own ships, and make its own armor, guns and munitions'? Shall the government make preparedness its own business? It is no use trying to disguise the fact that in this question of change of govern mental policy there are involved somewhat of militarism and a good deal of socialism. But the people will not stand hundreds of millions more of taxation, with the tißual tribute to the war trusts. Nor can the president excuse Mb omission on the ground that the method of preparedness is wholly a question for congress to discuss. He discussed and urged methods of raising the money for preparedness. i a i What's Your Skeleton For? Who Was Cicero? They are having lots of fun in New York over the answers to questions in a state examination for teachers' certificates. For example: "What is the purpose of the skeleton?" "Something to hitch meat to." Well, what's the matter with that answer? A fine jelly fish you'd be if you didu't have a bag of bones inside of ye to hitch your meat to! , Here's another, a definition of gender: "Gender shows whether a man is feminine, masculine or neuter." A little hazy, perhaps, that answer. But surely you must be provided with gender or some thing or other to determine just what many a fellow you meet these days really is. Going down Fifth avenuoo, New York, the neuters seem to have it. And here's one that interests us. Reply to question: "Who was Cicero?" "When Cicero delivered his orations he was a prefix." If we could have caught old Cicero, when we were going to school and studying those blamed old orations of his, you bet he'd have been a prefix—we'd have made his the pre nxture of a nice, large, flying brick. "Shakespeare was a great writer only he used too many familiar quotations?" 

AMEN! i I—. i i, Educate Boys For American Supremacy How to create a foreign market is one of the lessons which Germany has taught the world. The success of her plan has included the training of young men in the languages, business customs, financial systems, needs and wants, as well as the geography of foreign countries in which she wishes to spread her manufactures. The United States is going to become the greatest commercial nation in history. In all discussions of this promised supremacy there enters the question of labor and wages. And properly. Little is said, however, about the education of young men to place our manufactures in other countries, and to man age the details of foreign branches of American business. Our young men have always been loft to dis cover such chances for themselves. But here is a door to success never opened to our youth before. The time is ripe now for boys to shape their schooling to meet a big demand for intelligent and educated young men in the commercial world.

Ignores Three Important Issues How long will political freedom knock at the White House door and fail to arouse a man big enough to seize the opportunity for everlasting glory and rank among the immortal liberators 1 How long will this government, almost alone among governments, be able to dodge responsibility for the .national curse of strong drink t Nations, like all men, big or little, have in their spines soft, weak, elastic vertebrae. The right is long recognized, but it is easier, more comfortable to shirk, shift or make special pleadings to avoid tho accountability that must finally come. The causes of equal rights and eradication of the curse of drink are taking the same course that the cause of the black slave did. The right is as clear and plain to us and shines as fiercely as the sun at noon on a cloudless August day. We hesitate, we hide, we tempor ize, we talk of different human levels, we quibble about states' rights, and finally see that THE RIGHT IS THE LORD'S LIGHT, and wonder that we didn't see it so long before. Our sons will live to see our women as free as our negroes. They will see drink abolished by the United States government - And they will look on our tombstones and that that some of us were moribund with spine troublo quite a while before burial. M PRECKLES AND HIS FRIENDS i A NSWERS.... I % l\ By Cynthia Grey %imiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!iiiiiiiniiii# My Dear Miss Orey: lam a young man and would like to know how to grow a beautiful head of hair. My hair is dark brown, quite thick but awfully scraggy. It Just won't get wavy. I have tried several applications and prescriptions, but without any effect. Most young men have tholr hair combed pompadour style and their hair Is wavy. Is It natural or la it a way they care for their hair? Do barbers make hair wavy? Please answer in tomorrow's paper. ANXIOUS. A.—The appearance of the hair depends a great deal on a per son's general condition. If you keep yourself healthy and wash and comb your hair frequently, that is aO that can be done. If your hair Is not naturally wavy It cannot be made so by any method I ever heard of. In general, I would advise against Ihe use of patented prep arations) usually they do more harm than good. I doubt if the barber can do anything other than to help you keep your hair clean. * Q. —Can you tell me what the birthday superstition for De cember is? J. 0.

Read Zona Gate's stories of Friendship Village to learn how some public s|>iiited women brought civic purity to their town. Q. —What can a young boy give to a girl for Christmas? A—A boy may give to a girl anything which Is not of a per sonal nature. That is, he may not give her things to wear. That privilege in reserved for her I'amlly. He may give Iter hooks, flowers,, candy, school pennants, stationery, pen, silver pencil or any articles fur her desk.
