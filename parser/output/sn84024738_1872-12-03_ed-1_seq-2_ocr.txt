>.!?.? X ~ . * ' ? The President's Message. The full text of the fourth annual messago of President Grjlvt to the Senate and House of Representatives is laid before our readers this morning. It opens with a graleful ac-. knowtedgmcnt of the blessings vouchsafed to us by Divine Providence aud an appropri ate reference to the recent deviation by fire as the only overshadowing calamity occurring during the year. Neither war, pwtilme, nor famine has visited the United State*, and no cause seems to exist to threaten our peace in the future. ; A great deal of space is properly devoted to a recital of the circumstanccs attending the peaceful settlement of the questions at issue between this Government and that of her Majesty of Great Britain. When Con gress adjourned the question of consequential damages appeared to jeopardize the Treaty ot Washington in so far us it related to the Ala bama claims, but the arbitrators appointed under that treaty deposed of this matter, with others, without difficulty, according to the law and equity of the case, and-to the entire satisfaction of this Government. The Geneva tribunal, at the conclusion 01 its labors, availed itself of the discretionary pDwer given it by the treaty, and awarded to the United States indemnity to the amount of 513,500,000. The distribution of the money recovered from Great Britain is com mcuded to the attention of Congress, and it is recommended that a Board of Commis sioner* be created for the purpose. The settlement of the Northwest boup-, dary, or San Juan question, by the decision oi the Kmperor William, in which it l- de creed that the line between her Britannic Ma jesty and the United States should be drawn through the Haro channel, as claimed by the American Government, is noticed, and the services of the arbitratoraniitbcprompt uessof her Majesty in acccptiug the arbi tration and withdrawing her troops from our territory arc acknowledged. The Presi dent recommends the appointment of a joint commission to complete the survey and de termination of that portion of the line upon which the commission which determined the remainder was unable to agree? that is, upon the line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminous possessions ot Great Britain. Legislation to carry into effect the provisions oi the Treaty of Washington which relate to fisheries is "urged, and the increase of the surveying party now fixing the line between the United States and the British possessions between the Lake of the Woods and the llockv Mouutaius is advised. The President refers briefly to our peace ful relations with France, Russia, and Ger many; to the ratitication by both parties of a naturalization treaty with the Austro-Hun garian empire, and also to a treaty 011 the tame subject with Norway and Sweden. The importance of the International Sta tistical Congress at St. Petersburg and ol th'j International Industrial Exposition at Vienna is alluded to in terms of high nppre ciition, aud Congress is asked to appropriate money to delrav the expenses of commis sioners to the latter, and to authorize the Secretary ot the Navy to tit up two naval ves sels for transporting between our Atlantic cities aud Trieste articles to be exhibited by Americans. The President suggests that t.ie next International Exposition should Le lield in this country in 187G, on the occasion oi the celebration of the centennial of Ameri ca:! independence. A speedy settlement of the boundary ques 1ihi now at issue between the United States :md Mexico and a eessatiou of the outrages committed upon American citizens on our Tlx: 111 frontier are anticipated, and the Pre Miknt compliments the present and late Pre sidents of the Mexican republic. The continuation of the war in Cuba is noticed with 1 egret,and the President thinks that .Spain ami the insurgents occupy the ttune relative attitude that tl.ey did a year airo. He regards slavery in Cuba as " the nutunU cause of u terrible evil." It Is hoped that .Spaiu will l* voluntarily adopt this vio\\\" aud execute the emancipation laws rnucted two years ago. The holding of slaves by American citizens in Cuba is ad verted to, and Congress is asked to legislate *o as to discourage if not prevent this. In glauelng at the situation iu the allied Republics of the Pacific coast, Brazil, the Argentine Republic, aud the Central A men cm States, the President incidentally raps Venezuela over the knuckles, aud intimates tint she is too slow about paying her debts to the United .States. He did the same thing las', year. Our treaty relations with Japan and Chiua are reported uuchauged. The remarks relative to the finances of the Government are interesting. It is claimed that the principal of the public debt has been reduced one hundred millious, and the means of this reduction are given. The President thinks it doubtful whether a further reduc tion of taxation is practicable for the present, aud recommends that there be no further legislation on the subject except to correct errors in the present laws, until it can be proved that it can be done and leave suffix eiont revenue to meet current expenses, pay interest, and provide for the siukiug fund. Next to tho preservation of the national credit the. President esteems it important to provide a uational currency of fixed aud un varying value as compared with gold, and a$ fcoou as practicable convertible into gold at par. One of the most interesting parts of the xue&sage is that in which reference is made to the various enterprises for the cheapcr and more certain transportation of the sin plus of western aud southern products to the Atlantic seaboard. But we confess to a sniaU measure of disappointment that, after las imported assurances to Senator Lewis and lU'presentatives-elect Smith and Sexer, the President has not made a more particu lar allusion to that great national work of internal improvement iu which Virginia is (.-specially interested?the James "River and Iviuawha canal. Several water-line projects are grouped together, and the President simply recommends that this whole subject be referred to a committee or a commission, who shall consider it and report at some fu ture day with a view to legislation. The design evidently has been to make a complimentary nientiou of all such en terprises as can properly be brought to the attention of Congress without indorsing any in particular. Still it is a point gaiued if a committee is appointed; and with a fair hearing the James Kivcr aud Kanawha canal will stand a good chance for an appropria tion. Various appropriations recommended by the Secretary of War are favorably noticed; attention is called to the weakness of our navy and the necessity for strengthening it; and the President approvingly notices the condition of the Post-Office Department of the Government. The President evidently fat ON the postal telegraph iecommends- j isd looks npprovil subsidies tO 

SOTTMJ The part of the liiisuH ' aimUlpUliv, Ia*> llto <^iptlO? ? Department^ J US^ JMt? tTwT terest to the and enforcement acta, and seems to think tlicy have; had a salutary effect. That Blinnlll Iwv* ""*" i? not?trm?e when we recollect who have been lib inform ants and advisers in tbe past; but it pleases us to see that he disposed to acccpt the view that the pardon of some if not all of the un tuuate victims of the cruel laws rrf?rcd <? may result In good. His warning U> klAlux organizations to disband Is well m^nt. but seems unnecessary in view of tbe fact hat thc*c indiscreet associations ba\e cert } disappeared, if they ever existe . A satistactory exhibit of the affairs of the Interior Department is made, and the^Presi dent points with satisfaction and pride to what "he esteems tbe entire success or jns Indian policy. This l>olicy will be main tained, and as a part of it the Prcsidcn warmly urges upon Confess,bU, schemefor converting the so-called Indian T?" J south of Kausas into a home for the Indiana, erecting therein a territorial form of govern mfADt,liew and enlarged organization of the Patent Office is reported as nece?sary, an favorable mention is made of tbe proposition to separate that office from tbe Intend De partment. The Information given m regard to lands, agriculture, and pensions * inter esting and statistical. The President ap proves of tbe proposition embodied iu a bill now before Congress providing for tbe ap propriation of tbe net proceeds of tbe sales of the public lands for educational purposes An important recommendation is made in regard to tbe census. It is proposed that a uew enumeration be made in 1875, but that no apportionment of representatives in Con gress shall be made thereon. Such a census, being divested of all political character, un doubtedly has much to commcnd it to the favorable consideration of Congress. Affairs in tbe Territories are spoken of a* satisfactory except iu Utah. Tbe policy ot the legislation of that Territory is severely commented on by tbe President, and be re commends a earcful revision of its laws so as to secure peace to its citizeus and tbe ulti mate extinguishment of polygamy. Tbe Philadelphia centennial job comes iu for a tirst-rate notice, and, indeed, tbe Presi dent could c]o little less for a .State which gave liim a majority of ucarly 140,000 at the late election. Of civil-service reform the. President says little, but probably enough to convince tbe country that he has not changed the views on this subject expressed in his last message. He a-ain declares his determination to carry out the rules laid down by the commission, but reminds Congress that upon them de volves the task of making his successors walk in the same path. With these remarks the message concludes. A hasty examination of this long docu ment has given us a favorable impression of iU contents. We see in it many things worthy of commendation and some to which we nnv hereafter take, exception. We publish it in full for the benefit of tbe half-dozen iu every five hundred of our readers who read the messages of Presidents. The great majority will perhaps find this running sketch of its contents iuterestiu0 and useful. ? The Virginia General Assembly? ?For this is the aucienfcand dignified title of ttye body?meets in the Capitol on to-mor row. As the members have had a year's ex perience in legislation it is to be hoped the} will profit by their experience and avoid some discreditable things which blotted the journal of the last session. The same questions in a great part which occupied the attention of the last session will be presented to this. AN e have not heard so much of "Relief" this year as we heard during the year in which the delegates were elected?wv infer because the game of demagoguism was ended when the election took place. Aspirants whose merits were rather short spliced them out with promises of " Relief," which they ought to have known they could uot render, as tho last session j plainly proved. Those who electioneered in that way supposed they redeemed their promissory notes by offering resolutions and making a spurt or two; but we conjecture that if they ever come before the people ngain they will discover tliat they have made an error. The man that acquires a seat in the General Assembly .in that manner will not be let otfu ithout some better proof of his good faith. Hardly any earthly wrath is more terrible than the aversion of the deceived to wards the deceiver. He who excites popu lar expectations and hopes which he after wards disappoints is one who has little ground to expect forgiveness. The financial question will again occupy the legislative mind. It will find the diffi culties heaped up by another year in its way. Tbe Supreme Court has the question ot the obligation of the State to take the eoupons of the fuuded bonds in payment of taxes under consideration. We will not presume anything iu regard to its decision, but we suppose that tribunal commands its wonted respect at the bauds of the Legislature, and that its judgment will be looked to with the interest to which it is entitled. There is a considerable fund in the trca surv, that awaits the order ot the Legislature, upon which tho bauks are paying four per cent. Of course the banks can't pay four per cent, aud le content with six per cent. ? trorn their debtors. And yet the last Legi? ? laturc, which approved the amendment of the Constitution with the view of limiting tlie late of interest to six per ccnt., required the banks to pay this four cent, which inevi tably forced the borrower from the banks to pay ten. The Legislature will probably carry out the otject of the amendment to the Constitu tion and declare six per cent, tbe legal inter est for the use of money, aud make all iuter e.*t exceeding that usurious. Without going into the abstract argument we will merely say that other States fix the legal rate at a higher figure, aud that in all the great commercial communities much higher rates are paid. Therefore we cannot expect that capitalists will bring money to Virginia to invest They can do better else where. Indeed, the State has authorized various corporations to pay eight per cent., and in almost every instance the value of the corporate bond?or the value of money?has been determined either by the payment of interest higher thau six per cent, or the sale of the bond at much under par. Now, these are facts not to be gainsaid. They will not "down." Aud it is Justus well for the Legislature to look at them. Some of the States make ten per cent, legal, some eight, somo seven,and so on. Virginia need not suppose that the lowest bidder takes the money. She offers the capitalist no spe cial Inducements She taaefi him ?? sharply ? ? v. *;! YY... . ...V. Bp? >unisbat~ wbeakfevtloe^ "*"""" ? - - ? - ??? ? ? -I it drives much capital from Virginia* and will a^ur*<fly retard her improvement. We are not la the interest of <^<mey-changers,?'! Weftitfri the interest of the peopreofYJr i ginia. Therefore we do"8^rwfih"Tb see cap ital driven from the State, and deplore the possibility that Virginia shall enter the mar-1 ket in the?i!ty, and certainly unsuccessful, character of being the lowest bidder for money. ... If there is any one thing that especially demands the interference of the Federal Government in the aflairs of the nation it is in this matter of the interest paid for the use of money. It is of all things that in which there should be uniformity over the entire Union. The differing rates in different J States are constantly producing trouble and disturbance of the circulating medium. If j the exercise of any power by the Federal Government can be justified by the general benefits it would impart and the manner in j which it would promote the " general wel fare " it would be the exercise of the power ] to say what should be the rate of interest for money over the whole Union. Let us hope that the Legislature will be! practical enough not to take any step which will drive away capital, and that the body will in some way leave the citizen the liberty of making his own terms for the use of money, at least within limits that may en- j able him to compete with the outsider. Save the question of State debt and finance generally, we cannot see that there is much to detain the Legislature for a long time. We do trust, however, that if there is the | necessity of again extending the session be yond tbc limit placed upon it by law there will be frankness and manliness enough in the body to do so without a retreat behind the Govornor's proclamation convening it ill extra session to accomplish that object. That was a fault of the last session which for the sake ot Virginia we hope never to see repeated. France? ?is still in the throes of convulsion?this time, for the sake of humanity, bloodless. Nothing, however, has yet occurred to in spire despair that Thiers will not steer her through the storm. She has been between Scylla and Charybdis?monarchy and an archy?for some $me. Thikks deemed that be had enough recruits from the better part of both extremes, when combined with the conservatives, to establish a conservative government. The vote on Dufaure's reso lution seemed to sustain his view. The mi nority was very large, however, arid had it been united it would have been fearful; but it was composed of two deadly hostile bodies, and was, therefore, not so much to be feared. Yet things seem not to have gone exactly smooth, for yesterday's telegram announces first the resignation of the ministers, and j next their resumption of their portfolios lios upon the threat of Thiers that he, too; would resign unless they did so. As all of j them thus went back and Theiks remained President, we have still faith that he will put all things in order for a quiet, conservative ] government, which is what the people want. The quiet and gentle rural population of | France pray for it. Thiers knows the terrible enemy of | France?the irreligious lied Republican party. This ied him to declare a few days since that he believed in God and in the Christian religion?an extraordinary declara tion for the chief ruler of a Christian nation, but none knew the propriety and force of the act better than lie did. He saw tbe in stallation of a prostitute as the goddess of reason by that mad mob in Paris which for the time ruled France and shed rivers of blood to gratify their insane passions. We trust he will triumph. lie is devoted heart and soul to his country, has the confidence of her people, and if he cannot save her from the anarchists then her chance is almost desperate. The Alabama Case. The case of the two legislative assemblies in Alabama is another added to the numerous outrages which have occurred since the war, and which illustrate the evil of introducing into the constituent a barbarous element. "When a body of men composed of those who are ignorant of law, of those who have no re spect for it, and of those who arc wholly dis ! honest and corrupt, are elevated to the estate of legislators we cannot expect from them auytbing else than lawlessness and corrup tion. So, here in Alabama, we have a body of legislators, plainly in open contempt of law, forcing a quorum by fraud, meeting daily, claiming to be the legal Legislature, and the Governor just elected has recognized them as the real Legislature of the State. We cannot believe that this .outrage will be sanctioned by the Government, or any respectable number of the dominant parly in this country. Of what advantage can it be to tbem to inaugurate anareby in the land? "What can they gain by the disregard of law and the establishment of the supre macy of the mob? Parties are being re formed, and the outrage which affects one party to-day may be perpetrated upon an other to-morrow. For the safety of all parties, for the security of social order, for the dignity and justice of public administra tion, we trust this "Alabama case" may be made the ht occasion for a decision at Wash ington tbat may increase confidence in the maintenance of law and order in the land. The Tribune advises the Greeley electors to vote for G bant. As they are elected to vote against Grant we do not sec that it would gratify anybody or fulfil a duty by voting for him. It would be as well to give a blauk vote, as tbe World suggests. The refusal, yesterday, of the House of Representatives to allow 3Ir. Banks to re sign his post as the chairman of the Com mittee of Foreign Relations is a very good sign of the gradual extension and increase of good i'eeliug, and the subordination of party bitterness. . ?; The Presidential Electoral Vote.

It will be the pro vince of Congress to provide tor thtd.anbu tion among those who may be entitled to 11 their respective shares ol the moneytobe paid. Although the sum awarded ^J? mvable un'il a year from the date of the award?itis deemed advisable that no tunc be lo<t in making a proper examination of the several cases in which indemnibcat on mv be due. I consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for tnt ^ ^ THE NORTHWEST BOUKPAR^ ? By the thirty-fourth article of the Treity of Washington tbe respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of the treaty of the 15th of June, 1810, defining the boundary line be tween their respective territories, were sub mitted to tbe arbitration and award of his Majesty the Emperor ot Germany to decide which of these claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1S4G. llis Majesty the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to undertake the arbi tration, has the earnest thanks of this Gov ernment and ot the people of the United States' for the labor, pains, and care which he baa devoted to the consideration of this long-pending difference. I have causcd un expression of my thanks to be coruniuuicated to his .Majesty. Mr. Ban croft, the representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the ease and prepared tiie statement on the part of the United SUites with the ability that his jrast services justified. the public in expecting at bis hands. Asa member of the Cabinet at tbe date of the treaty which has given rise to the discussion between the two Governments, as tbe 31inis tcr to Great Britain when tbe construction now pronounced unfounded was first ad vanced, and as tlie agent and representative of the Government to present the case and to receive the award, be has been associated with the questioujn all of iis phases, and in every,stage has manifested u patriotic zeal and earnestness in maintenance ot the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much credit for the access which ha* attended the submission. After a paticut investigation of the case and of the statements of each party his Mnjesty tbe Emperor, on the 21st day of October last, signed bis award in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the United States that the boundary line between the territories ot her Britannic Majesty and the United States shouid be drawn through the Haro channel is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty concluded on the loth of June, 181f?, between the Govern ments of her Britannic Majesty and of the Uuited States. Copies of tbe "case" pre sented on behalf of each Government, and of the "statement in reply" of each, and a translation of the award, are transmitted here with. This award conlirms the United States in their claim to the important archi jH'Iago of islands lying between the continent and Vancouver's island, which for more th;?.n twenty-six years (ever since the ratitica tion of the treaty) Great Britain has eon tested, and leaves us for the first time in the history of the United States as a nation with out a question of disputed boundary be tween our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on the continent. 

PROMPTNESS OK HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT IN GIVING KFFECT Tu TUE AWARD. It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, s?pontaneoLa> action of her Majesty's government in giving eli'cct to the award. In anticipation ol' auy request from this Go vernment, aud before the reception in tbe United Stales of the award signed by the Emperor, her Majesty had given instructions for the removal of "her troops which had been stationed there, and for .the cessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction, so as to leave the Uuited States in the exclusive pos session of the lately-disputed territory. I am gratified to be able t6 announce that the orders for the removal of the troops have l>cen executed, and that the military joint occupation. of San Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of tiie Uuited States. ANOTHER norxjur.v COMMISSION RECOMMENDED. It now becomes necessary to complete tlie survey and determination of that portion of the boundary line (through the Haro chan nel) upon wtiich tue commission which de termined the remaining part of the Hue were unublc to agree. J recommend the appoint * l"V* J JfYii'Jjj r ,-rrnI i ? afIcgia?(<Pw tbFTcspeeti ve uoverumenfcp, I points to the importance of establishing by natural objects or other monuments the! actual line betwaenthe territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the adjoinjnjgj^iLs.. sessions of her The region is now so .sparsely- occupied that no conflic li?c interests of individuafsor of jurisdiction,, are likely to fnterfere fb the delay or em-j barassment of the actual location of the, line. If deferred until population shall enter and occupy the territory, some trivial con test of neighbors mar again array the two Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointraentof a commission to act Jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminus possessions of Great Britain^ In my last umraal message I recommended the legislation necessary on the part of the United Stateo to bring iuto operation the ar ticles of the Treaty of Washington of May S, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so sodii as the proper legislation should be had oft the part of Great Britain and its possessions. That legislation oti the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not then been had^ and during the session of Congress a question was raised which for the time raised a dOubt I whether any action by Corigress in the direc tion indicated would become important. This question has since bbeti disposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislatures of the pro vincial governments have passed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the ' matters referred to into operation. I there-' fore recommend your early adoption of the legislation in the same direction necessary on the part of this Government. The joiut commission for determining the boundary line between the United States and the British possessions between the Lake of tho Woods and the Rocky Moutftains has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be increased, in order that the completion of the survey and deter mination of the line may be the sooner at tained. To this end I recommend that a sufficient appropriation be made. OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER TOWERS. With France, our earliest ally ; Russia, the I constant and steady friend of the United States; Germany, with whose government I and people we have so many causes of friend-' ship and so many common sympathies ; and | the other Powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms. Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratifications of a treaty | with the Austro-Hungarian Empire relating to naturalization ; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consuls and trade-marks ; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway relating to naturalization; all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION. Congress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray the expense of commissioners on the part of the United Suites to the International Statistical Con gress at St. Petcrsburgb, the persons ap pointed in that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessions of the Congress. Their report shall in due season be laid before you. This Congress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions in several of the countries of Europe. 1 submit to your consideration the propriety of extending an invitation to the Congress to hold its next meeting in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting. i - - ? * i year in V ienna ou a iscuic vi >u, 0 iiitude. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization, and of the elevation of industry and of labor, and of the increase of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good-will between nations. As the exposition is to be the first which will have been held in eastern Europe, it is believed that American inven tors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity for the pre sentation of their productions if encouraged by proper aid and protection. | At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this Government at t he exposition. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of nnv j appropriation there is danger that the impor tant bent tits which the occasion oilers will, in a large degree, be lost to citizens of the j United States. 1 commend the subject strong ly to your consideration, and recommend | that an adequate appropriation be made for ' the purpose. To further aid American ex hibitors at the Vienna exposition, I would recommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, tbat the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to lit up too naval vessels to trans port between our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna and ] back, their articles for exhibition. THE MEXICAN REPUBLIC. Since your last session the President of the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his high character uud by hi.s services to his country, has died. His temporary successor ! has now been elccted with great unanimity ! bv the people?a proof of confidence on their, part in his patriotism and wisdom which it is believed will be confirmed by the results ol his administration. It is particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government of either Republic to strengthen their relations as neighbors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of Mexico, anil that complaints of wrongs to American citizeus in various parts of the couutry are made. The revolutionary con dition in which the neighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some de gree contributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the present Government, the acts of which just complaints are made will cease. The proceedings of the commission under the convention with 31exico of the 4th of July, 18G8, on the subject of claims, have, unfortunately, been checked by an obstacle for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two Governments which, it is believed, will prove successful. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress of the 7th | of May last to inquire into depredations on the Texan frontier have diligently made in vestigations iu that quarter, and their re searches were necessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited appropriation made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similar com mission to investigate these outrages. It is notannounced officially, but the press of that -country state that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the cooperation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made at the earliest day practicable to enable the commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. THE WAR IN 

CUBA. It is with regret that I have again to an nounce a continuance of the disturbed con dition of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made. While the insurrection has gained no advan tages, and exhibits no more of the element* of power or of the prospects of ultimate success than were exhibited u year ago, Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded iu its repression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest bus lasted now for more than lour years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indiilercntto ils result, although humanity could not be unmoved by many of its Incidents wherever they might occur. It Is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued main tenance of elftTvry in Cuba is Among the ?I -is the I evil. fbe aboHtfo# of tkm of other ??8 of government^ in advance the 5n of peaee.wfl-ordcE. ,Bia#reaUy t >pe??bafc-tbe present fctbCTat'GOVCfm of Spain will VQtantariJy a<fc>pfLtfcis v!

Within the past few weeks the regulations for carrying out the law of emancipation have- Been'tuinounded, giving evidence of the sincerity of inten tion of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to drge the consideration Of the wisdom, the policy, and the Justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil which oppresses a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close to otf? border, as well as the expediency and the justice of conceding reforms of which the propriety is not.questioned. Deepiy impressed .with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of tliem^st active causes of the continuance of the un happy condition in Cuba; I regret to beiieve that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what ft there claiihecT as property, but which is forbiddeii. and denounced by the laws or the United Stated They are thus, in defiance of the spirit -of our own laWs, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my. last annual message I referred to this sub-! ject, and I again recommend such legislation as may be proper to denounce and, if not prevent, at least to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves, sorrn and centhal amekican governments. It is gratifying to announce that the ratifi cations of the convention-concluded under the auspices ol this .(Government between fjpaiu on the oue part, and tbe allied repub lics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the. instrument is herewith sub mitted. It is hoped tjbat this may be followed by a permanent peace between tbe same par ties. The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace between Brazil and the Argentine republic, it is hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjust ment. . .. . ,-7 ?/ t j With the states as with the republics of Central and South America we continue to maintain the most frieudly relations. It is with regret, however, I annouuee that the Government of Venezuela has made no fur ther payment oh account of the award under tbe convention of the 20th of April, 1S66. The latter republic is understood to be now almost il not quite tranquillized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time iu provid ing for tbe unpaid balance of its debt to the United States,.. which, having originated id injuries to our citizens by Venezuelan au thorities, and having been acknowledged pursuant to a treaty in tbo most solemn form known among nations, would seem to de serve a preference over debts of a different origin and contracted iu a different manner. This subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. J AT AX AND
