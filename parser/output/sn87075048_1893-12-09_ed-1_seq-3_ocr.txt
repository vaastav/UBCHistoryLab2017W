Number of Pensioners Added to the Roll For tho Year 123,684. The President Recommends a Reform in the Seeds De partment. Owing to Hard Times and m Depleted Treainry, Economy In Congressional Legislation la Urged Tlio rrcitdont Favor the Reduction of Prei ent Tariff Kates on tlio Nec essaries of Life. To the Congress ot the United Stalest Tho constitutional duty which requires the president from ttmo to tlmo to glvo to tho con gress Information ot the stato ot tho union and recommend to their consideration such mcas wes as ho shall Judge nccossary and expedient, la fittingly entered upon by aommending to tho congress a oaroful examination of tho dotalled tatements and woll-supported recommenda tions contained In the reports of the heads ot departments who aro chiefly charged with the exoeutlvo work of the government. In an ef fort to abridge this communication as much as Is consistent with Its purpose I 'shall supplement a brief reference to the contents ot these departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and incidents as aro not embraced therein, and by such recommend ations as appear to be at this particular tlmo appropriate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year bcon entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situation ro mains that will not yield to tho spirit of fair ucss and lovo of justice, which, Joined with con sistent Drmnass, characterize a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor having accepted the offlco of arbitrator of tho lone; Branding missions bout dory dlsputesrtendered to the president by tho Argentine Kopuoiio ana nrnzll, It has bcon my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those stato to lay before mo evidence and arguments in behalf of their re spective governments. The outbrf&k of domestic hostilities In thi remTblio of Brazil found the United States alert to watch tho interests ot our citizens In that tountry with which we carry on Important commerce. Several vessels ot onr now navy are now, and for some time have bcon stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The strug gle being between the established government, . which controls the machinery ot administration, and with which wo maintain friendly relations, and certain ofllccrs of tho navy employing the vessels of their command In an attack upon tho national capital and cblof seaport, and lacking, as it docs, tho elements of divided administra tion, I havo failed to see that tho insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as belliger ents Thus far the position ot our government has been that of an attentive but Impartial ob server of tho unfortunate conflict. Emphasiz ing our fixed policy of impartial neutrality In such a condition of affairs as now ex ists, I deemed it necessary to disavow. In a manner not to be misunderstood, tho un authorized action of our late naval com mander those waters in saluting tho revolted- Brazilian Admiral being Indisposed to countenance an act ca'culqted to glvo gratuit ous sanction to the local insurrection. The con vention botween our government and Chill hav ing for its object the settlement and ad justment of tho demands ot tho two countries against each other has been made ef fective by the organization of the claims com mission provided for. Tho two governments falling to agrco upon the third member. The good offices of tho president of the Swiss republio were invoked, as provided in the treaty, and tho selection ot the Swiss represen tative in this country to completo the organiza tion was gratifying allko to the United States and Chill. 'Iho vexatious question of so callsd legation asylum for offenders against tho stato , and its lans was presented anew in Chill by tho unauthorized aotlonof the United States minis ter in receiving Into his official restdenco two persons who had Just failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending growing out of a former abortlvo disturbance. Tho doctrlno ot asylum as applied to ttaH ease is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and when allowed tends to encourage sodltlon and strife. Under no circumstances can the reprensntlves of this government be parniltted, "tindertho Ill-defined action of extraterritorial ity, to interrupt tho administration or criminal justice in the countries to which they aro acred Itcd. A temperate demand having been mado by tho Chilean government for the correction of this conduot In the Instance mentioned, tho ,, minister was instructed no longer to harbor the offenders. Tho legislation of last year known as the Geary law, requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to rcsldeocd In tho United States, and the deportation of all not complying with the provisions of the act within the time paajorlbed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the advlae of eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese la borers, pending Judlolal Inquiry as to Its valid ity.ln good faith deelined to apply for the cer tificates required by its provisions. A test cao upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before the supremo court, and on May It. I8M, a decision w as made by that tribunal sustaining the law. It Is believed that under the recent amend ment of the act extending the tlmo fox registra tion, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside In this country, will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus af forded ot establishing by lawful procccdure their right to remain, and that thereby the nd-' cesslty ot enforced deportation may to a great degree be .avoided. It has devolved upon tho United States minister at Peking, as dean of the diplomatic body, and In th absence of a representative' of Sweden and Norway to press upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder of Swedish missionaries ul SungPu. 1 Ills question Is of vita) Interest to all countries wboso citizens engage in mission ary work In the Interior. Jljr article 12, of tbo general act of nmssels, signed Jnly 2, 1690, for tho suppression of tho slave trade, and the restriction of certain in jurious commerce In the independent stato ot the Congo and In tho adjacent zone of Central Africa, tho United States and tlio nlnur signa tory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means for tho punishment of person selling arms and Ammunition to the natives and for tho confisca tion of the inhibited articles. It beln the plain duty of this government to aid in suppressing (he nefarious traffic, impairing' it does tlio praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in prog ress in that region, I recommend that an uot bo i 'passed prohibiting tho sale of arms and (ntoxt ' cants lo natlyes In the regulated zone by our citizens. Costa Rca has lately tostllkd Ms friendliness ,by surrendering to the United States In Iho ub sencoof a convention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from justice. It Is trusted that the ne gotiation of a treaty wlili that country to meet recurring cases o( this kind will soon be accom plished.' Intmy. opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition should be cencludod with all.ttiosc countries wltbwhtch the United States has not already conventional arrangements ot that Artwracleo ' J V rteemwl tt lilting to express to the governments til Costs Blw und Colombia the kindly' desire o,t, United Slates to sec their pending" boundary '.dispute1. Anally' closed b arbitration In cosformltl wllb the spirit of ibe treaty concluded betweae teem some years - eio.-;Uur relations j.wiio-wi fwpwvpiw uai mm sshibw be operative. While occasional questions at-1 testing our naturalized cltltonsroturnlng to the land ot tholr bltth havo arisen In our Inter- cuurao wnn unrmany, our rotations witn mas country continue satlsfaolorv. The qucstlon-t affoctlng our relations with Great Urltaln have bcon treated In a spirit ot irlendllncss. Negotiations are In progress be tween tho two governments with n vlow to such concurrent notion ns will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Bohrlng Soa tribunal of arbitration practically effective; and It is not doubted that Great Britain will eo-npornto rrccly with this country for the ac complishment of that purpose. The dlsputo growing out ot the discriminating tolls Imposed In tho Wolland Canal, 'ipon cargoes of cereals bound to and fiotn tho tako ports ot tho United States, was adjusted by tho substitution of a moro cqultablo sched ule of charges and my predecessor theroupon suspended his proclamation Imposing discrim inating tolls upon British transit through our canals. During the past yoar sn Araorlcan citizen, employed in a subordinate oommorclal position In Iltytt, aftor suffering a protraotcd Imprison ment on nn unfounded chargo ot smuggling, was finally liberated on judicial examination. Upon urgent reprcscntlon to tho llayltan govern ment, a suitable Indemnity was paid to the suf feror. Upon rocctvtng authcntlo Information or tho firing upon an American mail steamer touohlng at tho port of Amapala, bocauso her captain re fitted to 'deliver up a passenger In transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of tho military authorities of Honduras, onr minister to that country, under instructions, protested against thoVwnnton act and domanded satisfac tion. Tho government ot Honduras actuated by a sensoof justtco and In a spirit of tho ut most friendship promptly disavowed tho Illegal conduct of Its onicors and oxpresBcd slnccro re gret for tho occurroncn. It Is confidently an ticipated that a satisfactory adjustment will soon bo reached of the questions arising out of tho setzuro and use of American voisols by In surgents In Honduras and tho subsequent de nial by tlio successful government ot commer cial privileges to tboso vossels on that account. Tho commission recently organized under tho conventions ot 1831 and 1889. It Is oxpcctnd, will speedily scttlodtspntcsgrowlng out of tbo shift ing eurrcnts ot tho lllo Orando rlvor east ot El Paso. Nicaragua lias recontly passed through two rovoluttons, tho party nt. first successful having In turn boon dlsplicod by nnothor. Our nowly appointed minister, by his timely good offices, aided In a peaceful adjustment ot the contro versy Involved In tho Hrst contllot. Tho largo Amorlcan interests established In that country in connection with tho NIoaraugua canal wcro not molested. - The Canal qo. has unfortunntoly bocomo financially seriously embarrassed, but a genor ous treatment has been oxtended to It by tho government ot Nicaragua. The United States aro especially Interested In tho successful achievement of tho vast undertaking this com pany has In chargo. That it should be accom plished under distinctively American auspices and Its enjoyment assurred, not only to tho vessels ot this country as a channel of commu nication botwoon our Atlantloand Paclllo sea boardst b'lt to tho ships of the world In the In terests of civilization, Is a proposition whloh, in my judgment, does not ndmtt of question. An oxtradltlon treaty with Norway has re cently been exchanged and proclaimed. Tho extradition treaty with Russia, signed In March, 1887, and amended and conflrmod by tho senate In February last, was duly proclaimed last June. Tbe reptoauoed caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and scat to the Columbian exposition, has been presented to the United States In token ot amity and in commemoration of the event It was designed to celebrate. I recom mend that In nccoptlng this gift, congross make grateful recognition of the sincere friendship which prompted it. Important mattors havo demandod attention in our relations with the Ottoman porto. Tho firing and partial destruction, by an un restrained mob, of ono of tho school buildings of Anatolia collcgo, established by citizens ot tho United States at Marsovan,and iho apparent Indifference (of tho Turkish government to tho outrage, notwithstanding tho complicity ot somo of lis officials, called for earnest re monstrance, which was followed by promises of reparation and punishment for tho offenders. Indemnity for the Injury to tbe buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild glvon, registration of the school rjropcrty In the name of the American owners secured and cDlclcnl protection guaranteed. Tho boundry dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet unadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic Intorcourso between that repub lio and Great Urltaln, and reforenco of tho ques tion to Impartial arbitration, would bo a most gratifying consummation. Iho ratification by Venezuola of the convention for the arbitration of tho long deterred claim ot tho Venezuelan transportation company Is awaited. It Is hardly neocssary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to the Installation of tho present administration tho existing govern ment of Hawaii bad been suddenly ovorthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between tho provisional government of the Islands and the United States, and submitted to tho scnalo for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and dispatched Hon. James A. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impar tial Investigation ot tho 'circumstances attend ing tho change of government, and of all tho conditions bearing upon tho subjeet of tho treaty. After a thorough and ex haustive examination Mr. Blount submit ted to mo his report, showing beyond all ques tion that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our roprescntatlvo to that government, and through the intimidation caused by the pres ence of an armed naval forco of the United Statos. which ias landed for lh-t perposo. at tbo Instanco of our minister. Upon tho facts developed, 1 seemed to me tbe only honorablo course for our government to pursue was to un do tlio rong mat had been done by those rep resenting us, and to restore, as far as prac ticable, tho status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom plishing this result within the constitutional limits of erccutho power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing -out of -any changed conditions brought about by unjustifiable Interference, our present minister at Honolulu has recolvcd appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information ot the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are soon expected When received, they will be promptly sent to tho congress, together with all othor Informa tion at band, accompanied by a special execu tive message fully detailing all tbe facts neces sary to a romplete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all tbe material events leading up to the presont situation. By a concurrent resolution, passed by the senate, February H, 1800, and by tbe house of representatives on the 3rd of April following, the president was requested "To invite from tlmo to time, ns lit occasions may urlso, nego tiations with any government with which the United States has or may hae diplo mat relations, to tho end that any differences or disputes arising botween tho two governments which can not be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means. April IB, 1809, tbo international American conference of Washington, by resolution expressed tho wish that all controversies between the republics of America and tho nation's of Uu'rope might bo settled by arbitration und rec ommended that Ibe government of each nation represented In that conferenco should commun icalo this wish to all friendly powers. A favor ublo tesponso has been iccolved from Groat Britain In the shapo of a resolution adopted by parliament July 1(1 last cordially isjmpatbtzlng with tho purposo in view nud expressing tho hopothat her majesty's government will lend ready co-operation to tho govornnicnt ot tho United States uron tno basts ol the concurrent resolution above quoted. Slnio Ilia passage of tho act of March 3,1653, uuthoilzliiz thcprcsldont to ralso thogiado of our envos to correspond with tho rank In which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Gcimany have conferred upon their representa tives ut Ih s capltol the lltlo of ambassador, and have responded by accrediting the agents of llm United States In tlicso counttlcs with thcboino title A like eloval ion nf mission Is announced by Russia, and when maJu will bo similarly met. This slcp lltllugly comports with the position tlio United Suites ho'd in tho ,f amlly of nations, 'Hie secretary o u treasury rvpuris wui the receipts of the government from nil sources during the Ascot year ended June 30, 1893, amounted to U6l,TI0,l6l.9t and lis expenditures to (W,37i,a 8V, There was collected front cus toms 0.3U,0iarj and from Internal revenue HOI.vHr.O.'ara.

Th amount of gold exported was larger than ar,r previous) car In tlio history of tho govern ment, amounting to 1108 00,811, and exceeding tho amount exported during tho preceding year by tM,48",5l7. The sum paid from tho treasury for sugar bounty was (B,n5,l"0 8S, nn lncrcaso over tho preceding year ol $i,03J,0f3 09. , It Is estimated upon the basts of present rev nuo laws that the reelpts of the government for the year ending Juno 30, 1801, will bo $P0,12I, 303.88, and Its expenditures l58.l2l,SftU9, result ing In a doflclt of 128,000.000. ' On the first day of November, 1801 the amount of monoy of all kinds In circulation, or not Included In triasurv holdings, was Jt.718.. 511,082, an lnoreaso for tho year of 1112,401,017. estimating our population at 07,420,000 at the time mentioned, th per captta circulation was 125.40 On the samq date there was In tho trcas ury gold bullion amounting to 800,057,273, and stiver bullion which was purchased at a cost of 1128,201,553. Tho purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1803, during th, last fiscal yoar, aggregated 54,008,102.50 fine ounccs.whlch cost 115,531,374 53. The total amount ot silver purchased from tho time that law bccumo operative until tho repeal of Its purchasing clause, on tho 1st day of No vember, 1891, was 108,074,590 40 fine ounces, which cost I55,9,910 84. Botween the 1st day of March, 1873, and tho ist day of November, 1803, tho government purchased under all laws, 603,001,717 flno ounces of sliver at n cost of 1510, 022,0ia Tho silver dollars' that havo been oolnod under the not of July 14, 1800, number 30,087,285. Tlio sclgntorago arising from such oolnago was JO 977,098.30, leaving on hind In tho mints 14d,099,7GO One ounces of silver which cost 1126,758,218. Our total of all motals, during the last fiscal year, consisted of 07,230,875 pieces, valued nt 143,085,178 80, of which thore was 3J,033,140 In gold coin, I5.3J3.71b In silver dollnrs, $7,217,220.00 In subsidiary silver coin and 1,030,102.90 in minor coins During tho calendar year 1802, tho production of precious mctnls In tho United States was estimated to be 1,501,375 fine ounces of gold, of tho commercial and coinage value of $33,000,000, and 68,O00,(X0 One ounces of Bllvcr of tho bullion or mnrkotvalue of $50,750,000, and ot tbo coin age value ot $7i,0b0,900 It Is estimated tbat on tho first day or July, 1893, tho motalllo stock of monoy In tho United Stales, consisting of coin nnd bullion amounted to Jl.213,5-9, 103, of which $397,097,085 was gold and $015,801,481 was silver, One hundred and nineteen National banks wero organized during tho year ending October 31, IE9J, with a capital of $11,230,000: forty-six went Into voluntary liquidation and ono hun dred and fifty-eight suspended. Slxty-flvo of tho suspended banks wcro Insolvent, eighty-six resumed business, and seven remain In the hands ot bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption. Tho recont repeal of tho provision of law re quiring tho purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary schomo has mido an cnllro chango In tho com plexion of our etirroncy affairs I do not doubt that tho ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In tho nnturo of things, howevor. It Is Impos sible to know nt this time, precisely whit con ditions will be brought nbout by tho chango, or what, If any, supplementary legislation may, In tho light ot such conditions, appear to bo essen tial or expedient. Of courso, after tho recent financial purturbatlon, time Is necessary for tho re-establtsbmcnt ot business confidence. When, however, through this restored con fidence tho monoy which has been frlghtonad Into hoarding placos is returned to trado and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a sato path leading to a permanently sound curronoy abundantly sufficient to meet every equivalent of our in creasing population and business. In the pur suit of this object wo should resolutely turn awny from alluring nnd temporary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In theso circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay In dealing with this subject, Instead of being Injurious, will increase tho probability of wise nctlon. Tho monetary conforence, which assembled at Brussels, upon our Invitation adjourned to tbo30thdayof November, in tho present yoar Tho considerations Just stated and tho faet that a dcllnlto proposition from us seemed to bo expected upon the reassembling of tho con ference, led me to express a willingness to havo tho meeting still further postponed It seems to mo that it would bo wlso to glvo general authority to tho president to Invito other na tions to such a conference at any time when there should bo n fair prospect of accomplish ing an International agreement on the subject of coinage I deslro also to earnestly suggest the wisdom of amending tho existing statutes In regard to the Issuance ot government bonds. The authority now vested in the secretary of the treasury to Issue bonds is not as clear as It should bo and tbo bonds authorized aro disad vantageous to tho government both as to tho tlmo of their maturity and rato ot interest. Tho superintendent of Immigration through the sccretaiyof tho treasury reports that during tho last fiscal year there arrived nt onr ports 440,793 immigrants. Of these I, CO J wcro not permitted to land under tho limitation of tbo law nnd 577 wcro returned to the countries from whenco thuy camo by roason ot their hav ing becomo publio charges Tho total arrivals were 141,031 less than for tho previous j ear. In regard to the prevention of contagious dis eases entering from foreign ports, the president says: A moro general and harmonious system than now exists,'actlng promptly and directly overywherc, and constantly operating by pre ventive means to shield our country from tho invasion of disease, and at tho samo tlmo having duo regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to tho safety of our people The socrotary of war reports that tho strength of tbe army on the 30th day of September last, was 2V.778 enlisted menand2,llt officers Tbo total expenditures of the department for the year ondlng Juno 30, 1E93, amounting 10 $51, 900,074 89 Of this sum 11,9)3,581 95 was for sal aries and contingent expenses, $t,377,E28 35 for tbe support ot tho mllltaiy establishment, $0, 077,033 18 for miscellaneous objects and $-0,518,-031 41 for public works. This latter sum In cludes $15,290,870 40 for river and harbor Im provements and $3,200,111 20 for fortifications and other works of defense. The total enrollment of tho mllltla of the sev eral states was on tbo 31st ot October of the current year 112,597, officers and enlisted men. Tho officers of tho army detailed for the Inspec tion and Instruction of this reserve of our mili tary foroe report that increased interest and marked progress are apparent in the discipline and efficiency of the organization. Nclthor Indian outbreaks nor domcstlo vio lence have called the mllltla Into service during the year, and the only active military duty re quired of It has been In tho department of Texas, where violations ot tho neutrality laws ot tho Unltod .Stales and Mexico wero promptly and efficiently dealt with by the troops, elicit ing the warm approval of the civil and military authorities of both countries The operation ot wise laws and tho Inflnonces ot civilization constantly tending to re'.love tho country from tlio dangers of Indian hostilities' together with tho increasing ability of tho slates, through tho efficiency of tho national guard organizations, to protect their tltlecrs from domestic violence lead to tho suggestion that tho tlmo is fast approaching when thcro should be a re organization of our army on tho linesof tho present necessities of tho country. Ills grutlfvliv; to noto that wohnvo begun to attain completo results In tl,o coniinclienslvo schemo of sea-coast defense and fortification, entered upon eight years ago, A largo sum has been already expended, but liio cost of inali, teiiance will bo Inconsiderable ns compared with the rxi ens of construction mid ordnance.

Progress has been made In this direction, and It Is desirable that cougifssby udequato appioprlallons should provide for tho uninterrupted prosecution cf this necessary work. The work on tho projected Chlckaimugua and Chattanooga military park has been pipsccutcd Willi zeal and Judgment nnd Its ononlin will bo celebrated during ho coming j car, Over 11I110 square mites of the Chlckamaugua bnttlo Held hayo been acquired, twenty-live miles of roadt way havo been constructed and permanent tab lets have been placed at many historical points while (he Invitation of tha states toiinark tbe pojltloo of (bclr. troops participating In tbe bat tle bas beta generally accepted, 1 be' work of kkMUMaad'PwssrvlagtUiaOlaas of Utliaai tory progress on tho plans dlrcatod by'the last congress. Tlio report ot tho attorney general contains thotisuil summary of tlio affairs ond proceod Ingsot tho department of Justlco for tho past j ear, together with certain recommendations ns to needed legislation on vnrlous subjects. I tan not too heartily Indorso tho proposition that tha fee system ns applicable to the com pensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerk of federal courts, and United States com missioners, should bo abolished with as llttlo delay as possible It Is clearly In tho interest of tbo community that tho business of tho courts, both civil and criminal shall bo as small and ns Inexpensively conductod as tho ends ot Justlco will allow, Tho syslcm Is, therefore, thoroughly vicious which makes tho compensation ot court officials depend upon tbo volume ot such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper oxocu tlon of tho law and private gain, which oan not fnll to bo dangerous to tho rights and freedom ot tho citizen and an Irresistible temptation to thounjustltlnblo expenditure ot publio funds. If, In addition to this reform, another was In augurated which would glvo to United States commissioners tho flml disposition of petty of fenses within tho grada of misdemeanors, es pecially tlioso coming under tho Internal rov cnuo laws, n great iidvanco would bo mado toward a more decent administration ot tho criminal law. Tho president "heartily Joins tho attornoy genornl In recommending legislation fixing de grees ot tho crlmo of murder within federal jurisdiction, as has been dono In many of tho states; authorizing writs ot error on behalf ot tho government In cases where flml Judgment is rendered ngalnst tlio government upon any other question arising before actual trial; limiting tho right of review in cases of felony punlshablo only by lino aud Imprisonment to vbo circuit court ot appeals, and making speedy provisions for the construction of such prisons nnd reformatories as may bo necessary for tho confinement of United States convicts. Tho report of tho postmaster goncral con tains a detailed slitcment of tho operations of tho post offlco department during the last fiscal year nnd much Interesting Information touch ing this important branch of tho public service. Tho business ot tho malls Indicate with abso lute cortalnty tho condition of tho buslnoss of tho country, am! depression In financial affairs Inevitably aud quickly reduces tho postal reve nues. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between tho post olllco reeolpts and ex penditures Is tho expected nnd unavoidable re sult of tho distressing stiingency which has provnllcd throughout tho country during much of tho tlmo covered by tho postmaster-general's report. Tho post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $7V,8rfl,9M 10, and Its expenditures to $81,074,101 00 'llils postofllcc deficiency would dlsippeai or bo Immensely decreased If Icbs matter was carried free through tho malls, an Item of which Is upward of three hundred tons ot seeds and grain from tho agricultural depart ment The total number of post offices In tho Unltsd States on tho 30th day .or Juno, 189.1, was 03,403, an Increase of 1,24 over the proceeding year. Of .theso 3 305 wcro presidential, an Increase in that diss of 201 over tho preceding year. Tho expense of freo delivery for tho fiscal year ending Juno E0, 1891, will bo moro than $11, 000,000, and under legislation now existing there must bo a constant lncrcaso In this Item of ex penditure Thoro wcro 0,401 additions to tho domestic money order offices during the I ist fiscal year, being tho largest lncrcaso in r. ty year slnco tho inauguration of tho system. Tho total number of theso offices at the close of tbe year was 18,434 I desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention tho suggestions of the postmaster-general relating to a more sensible and buslncss-llko organization nud a bo ttcr distribu tion ot responsibility In his rlcpartmont. The report of tho secretary of tho navy con tains a history of tho operations of his depart ment during the past year and exhibits a most gratifying condition of tbo personnel of our navy. Ho presents a satisfactory account ot the progress which has bcon mado in tho con structlon of vessels, nnd makes a number of recommendations to which attontlon is especial ly invited During tho past six months tho demand for cruising vessels havo been many and urgent. There havo been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American interests in Nicaragua, Guatamala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Argcntlno and Brazil, whllo tho condition ot affairs in Honolulu has required tho constant presenco of one or moro ships. With all tlicso calls upon our navy, It became necessary, in order to mako up a sufficient fleet, to patrol Bchrlng sea under modus vlvcndl agreed upon .vlth Great Britain to detail to that scrvlco ono vessel from the fish commission and ono from tho rcvenuo marine. Progress In tho construction of new vcssols has not been as rapid as vv as anticipated. Thcro havo been delays In tho completion of un armorcd vessels, but for tho most part they have been such as aro constantly occurring oven In countries having tho largest oxpeil enco In naval shTp building. The mrat serious delays, however, have bcon In the work upon armored ships. Tho troublo has bocn the fail ure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed. Tbo difficulties seem now, howevor, to have been overcomo and armc Is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. As a result of tho txporlence acquired by ship builders and designers and material men it is believed that the dates when vessels will be completed can now be estimated with reason ublo accuracy. Great guns, rapid tiro guns, torpedoes and powder are being promptly supplied. The following vessels ot tho now navy have been completed and aro ready for service: Tho double turrctcd const defense monitor Mlantonomoh, tho .double turrctcd coast de fense monitor Monterey, tbo armored rrulser Now York, tho protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charleston, Atlanta and Boston, tho cruiser Detroit, the gunboats Yorklown, Concord, Bei nlngton, Mach'as, Castlne and Petrel, the dis patch vessel Dolphin, tho practice vessel Ban croft, and tbo dynamite gunbou Vesuvius.

Tho execution of nhls law In its early stages doqa not sccra to have bcenlu accord with its true Intention; but toward the close of the last aduiliilslra ion tin aulhoratatlve construction was given to tho statute, and slnco that time this construction has been followed, 'ibis has bad the effect of limiting tbe operation of tbe law to ts Intended purpose. Tho discovery having beet made that many names had been put upon tho penstwt roll by means of whole sale and gigantic frauds, the conimlisloner sus pended pi.ymenl upon a number of pensions which sec-eel to bu fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complen examination giving notice lathe pei.Kipncrs, ,uoiucTu iaey wigni nays I an opportunity, to f list listW If possible, tLe jus tlso of their culms rolwlthstandlnir nnnarenl Invalidity This, I understand, Is tho prnctlco which has for a long tlmo prevailed In tbo pension bureaus but after entering upon tlicso recent Investiga tions ino commissioner modified this rule bo as not to allow, uiitlUrtiftera completo examina tion, Interference with tho pnjmcnt of n pen sion apparently not altogether void, but which had merely bcon fixed at a rato higher than that authorized by law. 1 nm unablo to understand why frauds In tho pension rolls should not bo exposed nnd corrected with thoroughness nnd vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls Is an Imposition upon tbe kindly senti ment tn which pensions havo their origin Tho sum oxpended on account ot pensions for tho year ending Juno 30, 1893, was 1150,710,407,14 Tho commissioner estimates that $105,000,000 will be required to pay pensions during tho year ending Juno 39, 1891, The condition ot the Indians and their ultl mato fato are subjeots which aro related to a sacred duty of tbe government, and which strongly appeal to the sense of justlco and the sympathy of our pcopl Our Indians number about 248,000. Most or them are located on 101 reservations, contain ing 80,110,531 aoroi of land. About 110,000 of theso Indians have, to a largo degree, adopted olv lllzcd customs. Lands In soveralty bas been allotted to them. Such allotments have been mido to 10,000 Individuals during tho last fiscal year, embracing about 1,000,000 aores. Tho num ber of Indian government schools open during tho year was 103, an lncrcaso of II ovor the pre ceding year. Of this total 170 were on reserva tions, ot which 73 were boarding schools and 97 wero day schools. I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must bo important factors in any effort to save tho Indian nnd lead him to clvllbatlon. I bollove, too, that tho relinquishment of tribal relations snd the holding ot land In soveralty may, In favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seems to mo, bow ovor, that allotments ot land tn sev eralty ougbt to bo mado with great care and circumspection. Tho solution ol the Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration. The personal fitness ot ngeats nnd their adaptabil ity to tho peculiar duty of caring for their wards, Is of the utmost Importance. Tho appropriations on account of tho Indian bureau for the year ending Juno 30, 1891, amount to $7,954,902.99, a decrease as compared with tho year preceding It ot 337,131 03. Tho vast area of land which, but a short tlmo ago, constituted tho publio domain Is rapidly falling Into prlvato bands It Is certain that in the transfer tho beneficent Intention or tho gov ernment to supply from its domain homes to tho Industrious and worthy homo seekers is often frustrated. Six million five hundred thousand acres, notwithstanding the utmost caro In fram ing tbo regulations govornlng the selec tion ot locations, and notwithstanding the pres ence ot United States troops, furnished an ex hibition, though, perhaps, In a modified degree, of tho mad scramble, tho v lolenco and tho fraud ulent occupation which have accompanied previ ous openings of publio land. I concur with tho Bocrotary in the belief that these outrageous Incidents can not be entirely Vrovcntcd without a chango in tho laws on the subject, and I hopo his recommendations in that dlreotion, will be favorably considered. The report of tho secretory of ogrlculture will bo found exceedingly interesting, especial ly to that largo part ot our citizens Intimately concerned In agricultural occupations On thc;7th day of March, 1893, thoro were upon Its pay rolls 2,430 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In vlow of a depleted publio treasury and tho Imperatlvedemand of the peo ple for economy in the administration of their government, the secretary has enterodupon the task ot rationally reducing expenditures by tho eliminating from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of tbe affairs of tbo department. During tbe first quarter of tho present year the expenses ot the depart ment aggregated $315,870.76, as against $402,012, 42 for the corresponding period of tho fiscal year ending June, 30, 1893 The secretary makes apparent bis Intention to contlnuo this rote of reduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by 50J 1,230 than those for tho present year. The regulations of 1832 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during tho last year, and tho large stock yards ot the country have been kept freo from Infection. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such as could havo been effectually guarded against by tbe owneis ot the affected cattle Whllo contagious pleuro-pneumonta in cattlo has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than plcuro-pneumonla, Is still prevalent. Investigations havo been made during tho past year, as to tbo means of its communication and tbo method of its correct diagnosis. Much progress has been made In this di rection by tbe studies of tbe division of animal pathology, but work ought to be extended, in cooperation with local authorities, until tho danger to human Ufa arlstug from this cause Is reduced to a minimum. ' I Join the secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for tho position of In spector or assistant inspector in tbo bureau of animal industry be required as a condition prec edent to his appointment, to exhibit to tho U. b. Civil Service commission his diploma from on established regular and reputable ve terinary collcgo and that this be supplemented by such an examination In veterinary science as the commission may prescribe. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for tho fiscal year ending June 30, 180), attained tho enormous figure ot $800, 000,00), In round numbers being 78 7 per cent, of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $015, 000 0., being 75 1 por cent of all American com modities exported. A reriow of our agricultural exports with special reference to their dcstlna t'on will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland aluorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cat tlo tho total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18)3, 120,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over $21,033,000. Of beef products of all kinds, our total exports wcro $28,000,000, of which Great Britain took 424,000,0)0. Of products tho total exports were $81,009,000; of which Great Britain took $53,090,000. In breadstuffs, cotton and minor products like proportions sent to the same destination are shown. The work of the statistical division of the de partment of agriculture deals with all tbat re lates to tho economics of farming, Tbe main purpose of Its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the world's markets, in which their products find sale. Its publications relate especially to tbe commer cial side of farming. "" It Is, therefore, of profound importance and vital concern to tho farmers of tbe United States, who represent nearly one-half of our population, and also of direct Interest to the w) ole country, that the work of this division be cftlc'cntly performed and that tho informa tion it has gathered bo promptly diffused During tbo last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $00,54861. The remainder of an appropriation of $131,000 was expended In put ting tbem up and distributing them. It surely never could have entered the minds of thoso who first sanctioned tho appropriation of publio money for tho purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratu itous distribution that frcm this would glow large appropriations for tho purchaso and distribution by members of corgress of ordinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings which are common In all tho states and territories, and cveiywhcro easily obtainable nt low prices. In each statu and teirltory an agricultural ex periment static 11 hat been established. These stations, by their vory character and name aro tlio proper agencies, to experiment with und tost now varieties of beeds, and vet this indis criminate and wasteful distribution by legisla tion and legislators continues answering no purpose unless It te to remind constituents thut their representatives are viuing to ratnemner them with gintuitics sH public cost, Under tho sanction of existing legislation ihcro was sent out from the ngilcullural do paitmcnt dt ring tho last flBcal j ear enough ot cabbage seed lo plant 19,21aciC!ur land.a suf ficient quantity of leans to plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 7,8)1 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,0.5 acres with vines, and enough 111 isl.melon and walei melon seeds tn plant 2,075 acrox Uhe total Quantity of (lower nnd vtgtlablo seeds thus distributed wns contained in moro than nine million pack ogtH, nnd they wrro sufficient, If planted, to cover t9 190 acres of 1 ind. 'Iho continued intelligent execution of tho civil fccrvlco law and tho Increasing approval by tho people of Its operation ore most gratify ing. Tho recent extension nf its limitations and regulations to tho employes at freo deliv ery post offices whltb has been honestly and promptly accomplished by the commissi, with tbe hearty t-o operation of the postmaster general, Is an immensely Important advance la tbo usefulness of the system. I am, If possible, paoro tban ever convinced ot the Incalculable benefits conferred by the olvll service law, not only In its effect upon tbe publio service, but' also, wbaf Is even more important, la Its aCaet i w eicvaiiuf lb tone of political life csUjr; Kconomy In public expenditure Is a duty tbit can not Innocently bo neglected by tlioso In trusted w Iih tho control of monoy drawn from tho people for publio uses It must bo confessed that our apparently endless resources, tho fa mlllarlty of our people with Immcnso accumu lations of weilth, tho growing sentiment among them thnt tho expenditure of public money should in somo mannor bo to tholr Immediate and personal advantage tho indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a largo part ot our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountability, havo led to a growing extravaganco In governmental appropriations. At Ibis lime, whon a depleted publio treasury Confronts us, when miny or our people are en gaged In a hnrd strugglo for tho necessaries of life, and when forced economy Is pressing upon the great mass of our countrymen, I desire to urg with all tho earnestness at my command, that congressional legislation be so limited by strlot economy as to ex hibit an appreciation of the condition ot the treasury and a sympathy with tho straightened clroumstances ot our fellow citizens. Tho duty of publio eoonomy Is also ot lmmcnso importance in Its Intlmato and neces sary relation to the task now in hand ot provid ing revenue, to meet government expenditures and yet reducing tho people's burdonsof tcdersl tnxatlon. Aftor a hard strugglo tariff reform Is dlreotly before us. Nothing so Important olalms our at tention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty an oppor tunity to desorve tbo gratltudo of our fellow citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by tbe empbatto man date of tbo people. After full discussion our countrymen havo spoken In favor of this re form and thoy bavo confided the work of Its ac complishment to tbo bands of those who are solomnly pledged to It. While we should staunchly adbcro to th principle that only the necessity ot revenue Justifies the Imposition ot tariff duties nnd other teddral taxation and that they should be limited by strict economy, we can not close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us whloh In Justtco and fairness call for discriminating caro In tho distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergenoy or our government actually demand. Manifestly, If we are to aid the poople direct ly through tariff reform, one of Its most obvious features should bo a reduction In present tariff charges upon the necessarlos ot lire. Tbe bene fits ot suoh n reduction should bo palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thousands, who would bo bettor fed, and better clothed, and better sheltered. Theso gifts would be the willing benefactions ot a government whose highest function is tho promotion ot the vvcltar of tho people. No less closely related to our peo ple's prosperity and wall being is the removal ot restrictions upon the Importation of tno raw materials necessary to our manufactures. The world should bo open to our national Ingenuity and enterprise. This can not be while federal legislation, through tho Imposition of hlgb tariff forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as thoso usod by their competitors. It is quit obvious that the enhancement of the prlco of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our borders, to the direct dis advantage of our manufacturers, but also In creases tholr cost to our clttxens. The Inter ests of labor are certainly though Indirectly In volved In this feature ot our tariff system. The sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply tho limited demons for their goods, soon fill the narrow market t4 whloh they are confined. Then follows suspen sion of work In mills and factories, a dlsoharge ot employes, and distress in the homes of our woritlngmen, Even if the often disproved as sertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the Intelligence of our work lngmen leads thom quickly to discover tbat their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, Is the most Important factor in their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prepared by the appro priate congressional committee embodying tar iff reform on tho lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative ac tion. It is the result ot much prtrlotlc and un selfish work, and I believe It deals with Its sub ject consistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions permit. lam satisfied that tho ro. duced tariff provided for In tbe proposed legis lation, added 10 existing Internal revenue taxa tion, will. In the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produco sufficient revenue to meet tho needs of the government. Tho committee, after full consideration, and to povldo against a temporary deficiency which may exist before tbo business of the country adjusts Itself to tho new tariff sched ules, have wisely embraced In their plan a few additional internal rcvenuo taxes. Including a small tax upon Incomes derived from certain corpora to Investments. Theso new assessments are not only absolutely just nnd easily borne, but thoy have tho further merit of being such as can bo remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenover the necessity of their Imposition no longer exists. In my great desire tor tho success of this measure lean not restrain tho suggestion that its success can only bo attained by means of unselfish counsel on tho part ot the friends of tariff reform, and as a result of their willing ness to subordinate personal desires and am bitions to the general good. The local Interests affected by tho proposed reform are so numer ous and so varied tbat If all aro insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must In evitably fall. In conclusion, my Intcnso feeling of responsi bility impels me to invoko for the manifold in terests ot a generous and confiding pooplo tbe most scrupulous care and to pledge my most willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of the greatness and pros perity of our beloved country.
