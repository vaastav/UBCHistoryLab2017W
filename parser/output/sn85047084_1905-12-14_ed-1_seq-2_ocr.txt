Fresh Fruit Flavor In good preserves the fresh fruit flavor is very noticeable in the syrup. We know of none, not even the best homemade, which have a syrup, of such a rich fresh fruit taste as Heinz Preserved Fresh Fruits This quality is due to the care with which the fruits are selected and to the steam-jacketed kettles which preserve the aroma and flavor of the fresh fruit.

Don't light the giant burner except for special occasions. Don't keep anything over a large burner if the simmering burner will do the work. Turn the burners as low as practic able. Put vegetables on to cook in boiling water; it takes less time and less gas to bring them to the boiling point. Don't leave a burner lighted because you expect to use it again in a few min utes. Matches are cheaper than gas. HONOLULU GAS COMPANY, LIMITED. Mm Note these Prices: Beautiful Figured and Colored Kimonos, $1.50 each. Beautiful Figured and Colored Jackets, $1.00 each.

The Anti-Saloon League will in future carry on its chosen work without the aid of a professional director from the mainland. This has been decided re cently, and a new policy has been adopted. John Martin, the enthusiast in mat ters re'.igious, whose good work anions the prisoners at Oahu Prison, the sta tion-house and in the various missions in all parts of the town has attracted much favorable attention, will be the League's agent. John is not to stay in the office and direct meetings. Nor will he make speeches at public gather ings. Such formal work is not John's forte. He will be sent about town canvass lng every precinct in a sort of house-to-house method, to ascertain the views of householders on the question of sa loons, and especially if they are de sirous of having beer shops or other groggeries located in their vicinity. This foretastes a battle which the Anti-Sa loon League will wage against en croachments of the saloons upon terri tory which is looked upon as resi dence preserves, pure and simple, and which would be injured should the sa loons place branches there. Martin will commence his about the first of the year. labors SHALL- A LOBBY BG SENT TO WASHINGTON? Continued from Paee 1.) nterest now we are going to regret it xocfd ngls in the future." SWAXZY OPPOSES. F. M. Swanzy opposed the sending of a ciel-pration to Washington. "I think we are ali agreed," he said, "that it Is very desirable to get this money and have it used in this Territory, but I differ from -Mr. Gait in considering that it is necessary to send any commit tee forward to urge upon congressmen the desirability of conforming with the President's suggestion to give us this handsome percentage of our customs revenues. "There are two things in our favor. One is that the President has recom mended it, and the other is that we have so able a representative in Wash ington as Mr. Hatch to urge any claims we may have. If Mr. Hatch feels that he requires assistance, that will be given him. If he feels that more in fluence may be brought to bear by a committee from here, then I say let such a committee go forward. The va!u? of such a committee would have to depend upon its personnel. We would not want to send any man along who could not engage the attention of Congress. "Therefore, I would suggest that be fore anything be done in the way of selecting men to go forward, that Mr. Hatch, the accredited representative of the Chamber of Commerce, be asked if he needs any help in this matter, and if so, when he would like such a committee to go on. I don't know how long it would be necessary for such a committee to remain in Washington, or when this matter will come up. Any one going forward might find it neces sary to stay there a long time, but during this time they could, of course, do excellent work. "I can not help thinking that Mr. Hatch, who is largely acquainted in Washington and whose diplomatic re lations there while representing this country some time ago have made him conversant with all the ins and otits of political working, and who is highly thought of there, will not need any as sistance. But if he says send a com- Shylock was the man who wanted a pound of human flesh.

But I don't think there is any neces sity of our doing anything now." 1 i.v i':irvi.i nrnse rr state that if Mr. Swanzy would m:iKo a motion to that effect he would second it. OTHER SPEAKERS. Mr. Gait again took the tloor and said that no one knew when this question would come up before Congress. If it curie up soon they could not wait to hear from Mr. Hatch. If it comes up later on Mr. Hatch's advice would be just the thing. He thought it was niohly important that action be taken. L. Tenney Peck agreed with Mr. Swanzy. He thought that as the Chamber had an accredited representa tive in Washington, matters should be left to his direction. He would give just as much weight to the frank prop position of the President as anybody. He thought Mr. Hatch would canvass the situation at once. He believed that he had already consulted with the friends of Hawaii in Congress and that he had the situation well in hand. Here was the one tangible proposition open to Mr. Hatch on the threshold of his career. . To send men on now to take charge of this matter would not be the most delicate policy to pursue. He favored cabling to Mr. Hatch the busi ness community's willingness to aid him in whatever way he desired. . M. Giffard agreed with Messrs. Swanzy and Peck. He thought Mr recit s idea 01 earning Mr. iatch an excellent one. W. W. Harris favored sending a com mittee on. Although Mr. Hatch was on the ground it wouldn't do any harm to send others on. A delegation of repre sentative business men would be of great assistance. Mr. Lucas favored communicatin first with Mr. Hatch. Robert Cat ton was in favor of the policy recommended by Mr. Swanzy and Mr. Peck. He said, personally, he was totally ignorant of the ways of doing things in Washington. The President, who had recommended the appropria tion, might not wish such a committee to go on, as he had already attended to the matter. M. Phillips agreed with Messrs. Swanzy and Peck. J. G. Spencer agreed with Mr. Swanzy. He thought it might do more harm than good to send on such a dele gation. Mr. Hatch was perfectly com petent to handle this matter. R. H. Trent said: "I think this Is the best opportunity Hawaii has ever had to get in some real good, work aad I favor sending a representative body of business men to Washington to work up the policy under discus s-on. 1 think we will make a mistaite if we do not show that we fully ap preciate what is before 'us. As to con sidering that Congress would say this delegation was a paid one, Mr. Hatch is known to' be, and Congress looks upon him as a paid lobbyist. When the Taft party was here, many of them did not know who Hawaii's business representative in Washington was. I think the moral effect would be very good to send a delegation on. If we don't take prompt action we will make a big mistake." J. A. Kennedy said: "I- believe we should take action. The President's message has just been sent in to Con gress and it is now the long session. It strikes me, however, that there is plenty of time. Roosevelt introduced the 20-per cent, reduction bill in Con gress, and although he had to fight practically the whole of Congress, he carried his point. I believe he will carry this matter through. It might be advantageous to send a committee later on, but not now. There is plenty of time. Congress won't adjourn until June or July." Chairman Smith said: "We could as certain from Mr. Hatch what his views are. We can cable him that we are prepared to send on a committee. I think the chair would entertain a mo tion to that effect and that someone be instructed to send on such a message. 

CABLEGRAM TO HATCH. Mr. Peck moved that President Low- rey of the Chamber of Commerce and President Smith of the Merchants' As sociation be instructed to send a joint cablegram to Mr. Hatch, he to consult with the Delegate, stating that the two commercial organizations are prepar ed to send a committee to Washington to advocate this proposed measure, and to ask his advice in the matter. This was seconded by Mr. Garvie. Mr. Gait again rose to press the urgency ot tne neea or a committee going at once to Washington. He said: "X was very much interested in a con versation I had recently with a gentle man who has been serving as a judge in Alaska. (Judge Hoggatt), and he told me that they sent on large delegations j to every Congress, and they generally 1 got what they went alter. "It seems almost unnecessary lo praise Mr. Hatch. "But it seems to me this is a matter of importance to every one in this coun try and I don't think Mr. Hatch or any other one man should have such ,t matter left open entirely to his own judgment. "I think, however, it is an excellent idea to ascertain from Mr. Hatch hi3 views. I think that any community that has a recommendation made for it such as the President has made for Hawaii, and expects him to get it through Congress with the aid of one man, will get left. Here is Congress, with over 450 members, to deal with. It is a Herculean task for any one man. or even for two men, to handle. "If we are to make the best of this opportunity, facing the possibility of getting or losing this great amount of money, it seems to me the expense of sending a committee on and maintain ing it is a matter that should receive no consideration." The motion was then passed, and the committee was authorized to prepare j and send its cablegram at its earliest convenience.
