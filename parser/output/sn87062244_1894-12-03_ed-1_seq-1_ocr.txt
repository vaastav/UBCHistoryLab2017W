FINANCIAL ISSUES FOREMOST Senators Interested in tho Recommendations the President "Will Make on This Subject Hnch Bitterness Among Defeated Demo cratic Memfccrs Leaders "Will Restrain It. The second session of the Fifty-fourth Con gress begins at noon to-day. Beyond tho passage of tho regular appropriation bills it seems probable that little in ihe way of legis lation will be accomplished at the short ses sion, although several important propositions will doubtless bo pressed to the front. Among tho members of the dominant party in tho House, over half of whom wtre de feated for re-election, there is a great deal of bitter feeling against tho administration for real or fancied grievances. It will be the purpose of the Democratic leaders to curb, as far as possible, the display of resentment, but the Republicans will sparo no pains to pro voke and goad their defeated adversaries into lotting loose their vials of wrath. If tho rresident outlines a financial scheme in his message, as anticipated, it will probably fur nish tho opponents of his banking and financial views their desired opportunity. In the course of tho session, it is under stood, the Nicaragua Canal project will be brought prominently forward. At the open ing of the Congress, however, routine mat ters wiil bo Kept to tho foro to stave off, as far as possible. -unpleasant references to tho election, which would pro e distasteful to tho majority, but this policy can bo only partially successful, as the latitude allowed in debate on appropriation bills will throw the doors open to remarks on any subject Before the adjournment for tho holidays it will be necessary to pass an appropriation to carry out the tariff bill provision lo;jlnga tax on incomes, the collection of which be gins January 1, and while it will no doubt meet with much opposition and lead to a gen eral review of the arguments against such a tax, the general impression Is that it will pass by a large majority. The impeachment of Judge Ricks, of the Northern district of Ohio, will also furnish a diversion before the holidajs if tho Judiciary Committee, which investigated the charges, should present a resolution of impeachment and it should carry. The trial would occur in the benate, the chief justice presiding. Im peachment proceedings are rare and novel, and this one, the first since tho trial of Presi dent Johnson, would attract national atten tion. If a quorum is present to-day in tho Houso, as seoms almost certain, after tho calling of the roll nothing will be done probably bejond the reading of tho President's message. No definite programme has been arranged for tho remainder of the week. The Committee on Appropriations, however, has two bills almost prepared,(tho pension and fortifications bills, and they will be reported to-morrow so that work upn them can bo entered upon Wednesday. In the Senate the session will begin with a full calendar, tho result of committeo action during tho long session, and it contains at least 200 items, covsring a wido range of mat ters. Nothing has transpired to indic.no which of those 200 questions will receho first attention, whether they -will be taken in their order, or whether the calendar will bo fol lowed at all. Much interest is felt among Senators of all political beliefs in the President's mes sage and in tbo recommendations which the Secretary of the Treasury will make on finan cial questions. These will bne much to do in directing tho course of tho Senntc." I there, are recommendations for radical de partures in flnnncial methods they are sure to lead to much speech-making early in the sesbion, and later to form tho basis of com mitteo actions. Significance is also attached to Senator Toorheo3' declaration that ho will ask the Fi nance Committee to sit on Tuesday. Tuesday is tho day for the regular weekly meetings of this committee, but it does not ordinarily meet so promptly after the assembling of tho Senate. Chairman Yoorheos declines to state tho objoct of the meeting further than to say that it is to be held for the purpose of permit ting an exchange of views among members. If the President's message is received to day the executive recdmmenoations could, of courso, bo taken up, but as there had been no positive assurance as to when the message would come in when the meeting was decided upon, it would appear that the chairman had other objects In view. It is possible that his purpose may be to arrange a policy upon tho supplemental tariff bills. These bills have all been reported to tho committee but it raay be considered npcessary to discuss them further before deciding UDon a plan of action. Tho Democratic majority of the Finance Committee is on record in favor of tho passage of tho bills, and it is not improbable that the early action of the com mittee is sought to frustrate any attempt to prevent consideration. This is not altogether surmise, for it is known that some of tho so called conservative Senators have advised that a general party conference be held, soon aftor the Senate convenes, for tho considera tion of this question.

When tho second session of tho Fifty-third Congress opens at noon to-day probably about GO or 70 per cent, of tho members of each house will bo present. What they will do after having listened to the President's message nobody, of course, know3. A fow of tho solons wore accessible yesterday to The Times reporter, and what they had to say follows: When seen at his residence on Four-and-a-half street, Senator Morgan, of Alabama, seemed to take a gloomy view of tho legisla tive situation. "I cannot mako even an intelligent guoss," said the Senator, "as to what legislation Con gress will pas3. I cannot tell what spirit will animato the Democratic party. They have suffered a great defeat. Will they put them selves in touch with tho people Will they apply themselves to tho Krae questions that confront the country? Or will theyiemaln lethargic to tho pressing questions of the hour? The need of financial legislation is most urgent. Tho Stato bank tax. foisted on tho people under false pretenses, ought to be repealed. Tho freo coinage of silver is still the question of the hour. I have no criterion by which I enn foretell what Congress will do. I can only nope." Representative Swanson, of the Fifth Yir ginia district, was seen at tno National Hotel. He thinks that what legislation will be passed by this Concres3 depends largely on tho Pres ident's message. He said: "I would hardly like to venture an opinion until I seo tho members together and have a chance to ob serve what effect the medicine of the elections has had upon the majority. Nothing can bo done unless the Democrats come together and show a disposition to legislate instead of mak ing a record on yea and nay votes." Representative G. W. Wilson, of Ohio, laughed heartily as ho said: "If tho Demo crats have been wiso enough to read tho signs of tho times they will, at least, presB no more tariff legislation; nor do I think that addi tional silver legislation will bo passed by this Congress. The free sugar bill. howeVor, may pass, in which case n bounty would bo put on American sugnr. This would bo favored by tho Republicans." Tho Hon. N. N. Cox, of Tennessee, who Is stopping at tho Yarnum greeted The Times mnn heartily and said: "lam alwavsgladto talk to my old conferees, tho newspaper men, but you ask urn a hard ono this time. "The currency question is tho great one in my district. Tho Stato bank tax ought to bo repealed, but from the black eye it got last winter, I cannotjmore than hopo for action on it. No free coinage bill will be passed this ses sion, nor do I think that any tariff legislation will become law. I want to see tho Chicago platform made the law of tne land, and am ready for hard and constant work to that end." Senator Allen, of Nebraska.when seen at hja homo on Second street northeast, said: "I do not think that Congress will pass any legisla tion on tho tariff or the currency; no bills will bo passed except those to which thero is no opposition." 

CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING, Roger Davcy Accused by His Landlady of Abusing Her Confidence. On tho complaint of Sirs. Elizabeth Blako, less, of No. 1133 Fifth street northeast, Roger W. Davey was arrested by Policemen Duvall and Wheeler about 10 o'clock last night. The prisoner is a young Englishman, and he is charged with the embezzlement of $600 from Mrs. Blakeless. Davey has been living in his accuser's houso for somo time past, and ho managed to obtain tho confidence of hislandlandy to such an extent, it is said, that ho induced her to intrust him with her savings. When she be came suspicious and demanded tho return of tho money, Davoy refused. Hence his arrest. RED. ALASKA AND ILLINOIS. They Now Contain tho Only Russian Edi fices in This Country.

JAPAN'S LATEST PROPOSITION It Is Said to Involve tho Continued Occu pancy of Port Arthur Until China's Pledgos Arp Executed Japanoae Conduct at Port Artimr, as Told by an Eye-witness. Toeio, Dec. 1. Peaco negotiations aro pro ceeding. Tho minister of foreign affairs has handed to United States Minister Dunn a counter proposition for transmission toCnlted States Minister Denby. Owing to tho imponetrablo secrecy sur rounding the negotiations it is impossiblo at this stage to discover tho exact nature ot this counter proposition, but it Is supposed to differ from Minister Denby's original proposi tion, mainly in respect to tho amount of tho indemnity demanded by Japan, and in tho tho addition of certain rather onerous guar antees for the faithful execution of China's pledges. It is rumored thnt ono of these guarantees is tho continuation of Japanese occupation of Port Arthur until tho treaty conditions aro fulfilled, but it is npprohonded that such a demand may involve Great Britain, to which nation such occupation would bo obnoxious. London, Dec. 3. The correspondent of tho Times telegraphs as follows from Hiroshima, Japan. "I have just returned from the seat of war and hnd a conversation with Yiscount Mutsu Munemitzu, tho foreign ministw, in regard to tho misconduct of the Jnpanese at Port Ar thur. I Informed him that I had watched tho Japanese army enter tho town. Tho Chinese resisted to tho Inst. I saw Chinese in plain ciotnes witn urenrms concealed on tnelr per sons. I also found explosive bullets "The Jnpaneso reported that civilians fired upon them from tho houses, and they therefor deomed it necessary to exterminate them. The Japanese were further excited by finding tho mutilated remains of Japanese prisoners. Some of these prisoners had been burned alive. I saw no resistance in the town. "During tho next four days the Japanese pillaged tho whole town and killed almost every man. Yery few women or children were killed. Those who were killed were probably killed unintentionally. I saw scores of Chinese prisoners pinioned, stripped and shot, hacked with knives, ripped open, dis emboweled and dismembered. Many bodies wore partly burned. London. Den. 3. A dispatch from Berlin states that China has accopted tho English offer of n 4) per cent, gold loan of 1,200,000. a RED. NO FURTHER APPEAL. Minister Ucnby lias Asked No Additional Protection for Americans at Pekin. It is stated positively at tho Department of Stato that there is no fre3h reason lor appre hension touching tho safety of American res idents of Pckin, and that United States Min ister Denby has not made any appeal to tho department for protection sinco his original dispatch sent somo timo ago, and referred to at tho timo in tho Associated Press dispatches, in which ho stated that should tho Japanese troops attack Pekin tho safety o' tho foreign residents might bo threatened, and it would be well to send a force of United States ma rines to protect tho legation. As is customary in such cases this dispatch was promptly communicated to tho Navy De partment and fifty marines were ordered to be transferred from tho other vessels of the American fleot to tho Monocacy, at Tien Tsin, near by Pekin. In addition Admiral Carpen ter was instructed to put himself in commu nication with Minister Denby and to usohis discretion in doing everything necessary to insuro tho safety of tho American residents. AH of this took place somo timo ago, and since then Mr. Denby has made no further ap plication for protection. Ho is at liberty at any timo to transfer his legation to Tien Tsin. where It would bo almost under tho guns of tho Monocacy, and. in fact, ho was authorized to do tliis at a very early stago in tho war, when tho Chinese showed symptoms of disaf fection at the first reverses sustained by their armies. Tho legation would certainly bo much safer at Tien Tsin than at Pekin, a3 it is impossible for even the light draft Monocacy to navigato tho river up to tho latter city at this season of tho year. But tho fact that Mr. Denby. al though tho moans of communication are open, has not recently asked for aid from tho department is regarded as evidence that he feels no apprehension nt present and this view is supported by tho cable advices from Cheefoo to tho effect that, encouraged by the prospect of a restoration of peace, many of tho foreign residents of Pekin who had taken refuge at Tien Tsin were returning to Pckin. The foreign minister expressed himself as intensely surprised and grieved. Hitherto, he added, tho Japaueso army had been ad mired for its humanity asd discipline. Ho was unwilling to believe it possible that they had acted as reported or to express an opinion on tho subject until a detailed official report ar rived. Meanwhilo he authorized mo to say that ho was certain the government was sin cerely determined to act on principles of humanity and civilization, and was firmly ro- solved to maintain the honor of Japan and refute Ohineso slanders. "I am satisfied that tho government desires neither to conceal tho truth nor permit cruelties." A Chefoo dispatch to tho Times say3 that a Chinaman who escaped from Port Arthur states that thero were six generals of equal authority in command thero. One was from Shan-Tung, another from Hu-Nan, another from Szchuen, while tho other three were from Anhir. All fought bravely, but wore defeated by lack of unity in their plans. All tho troops were thoroughly demoralized and they fled. Two of the generals havo arrived at Chefoo. Ono is still in hiding. Another has gone to Tion-Tsia, wHero ho runs a great risk of be ing beheaded. It is reported that the Japanese fleet is desirous ot taking a more prominent part in tho war. The fleet was seen off Wei-Hao-Wei, but has now disappeared. Wel-Hai-Wel Is strongly defended. Tho Chinese fleot is still Inside tho harbor. The Gen. Chang is In command. Ho i3 a bravo and competent officer, and is assisted by several foreigners. Tho Chinese people say if peace is made disbanded troops would commit acts of outrage.

'IGNORANT OF THIS COUNTRY And Unlike Other English Tourists He De clines to Discus3 Oar Affairs Socialism, He Says, Allies It3elf to Trade3 Unionism as an Expedient Approves of Machinery. New Yoke, Nov. 2. Among tho passengers on the Cunard. steamer Etruria, which ar rived here this morning, was John Burn3, M. P., tho great socialist and labor leader of London. A delegation from tho labor organizations of New York city met him at Quarantine. The delegation consisted of E. F. MeSweeney, as sistant commissioner of labor; Samuel Gom pers, president of the American Federation of Labor; Chris Evans, secretary of that organi zation, and William O'Brien, of tho walking delegates. Mr. Burns is accompanied on his present trip by two fellow-members of Parliament Mr. David Holmes and Mr. John Williams Benn. Mr. Burns greeted the committee and then he talked with a represontative of tho Associated Press. "It would bo unfair to the American people for me to talk about them now," Mr. Burns said, "for really Iknow very little about them. I cannot talk fairly of American affairs for it would tako j ears of work forme to become familiar witn them in a way that would bo satisfactory to me. "As for tho socialist movement in England, it has come to stay. It will grow as it adapts itself to circumstances and as long as it con forms to tho conventions which have for so long made the upper and middio classes the ruling power. Socialism as it affects munic ipal matters is not mixed up with other issues. "I have been watching the labor movement in America as closely as I could from a dis tance, and I have concluded that thero must j bo a little more of the milk of human kindness injected into labor affairs if they are to pro gress as I would like to see them progress." Then Mr. Burns and the members of the committee discussed tho proposed arrange mentsforthe coming week. On the dock i were gathered about 200 members of the local labor unions, who cheered loudly for "John Burns" as ho walked down the gangplank. Then an informal reception was tendered him, and Mr. Dumar. of Typographical Tnion, No. 6, made a brief speech of welcome. In responding. Mr. Burns said it wn3 an agree able coincidence that he, who had been so strongly identified with tho docks in Eng land, should make his first speech in Amerl 'a on a dock, with tho rattle ot trucks and the swash of tho waters in his ears. . On many of the corners were gathered groups of dock laborers nnd cattlomen, who cheered for Bums as he approached, and many of tbem who had come from London greeted him with the old cry of the London dock strike: "How aro you, John?" to which inquiry Mr. Burns responded by stopping and shaking hands with them. Later in tho day Mr. Burns received a number of newspaper men and talked for an hour. After relating how Mr. Holmes and ho had been selected by tho labor federation at Norwich to represont that body at tho Amer ican conference at Denver, he said that their duty was to convey tho felicitations of English labor to that of America. Of his own visit here, ho said, ho came fir3t to observe tho condition of the labor move ment in America and in vha respects it differs from tnat in England; aad second, as a member of Parliament, to visit Congress and get a grasp of American political af fairs. Tho workings of the labor department un der Carrol D. Wright were of great interest to him. and as a county councillor he hoped to havo tho opportunity of inspecting tho various municipal departments ot the great cities of America, but more particularly to New York and Chicago. Prison labor, ho said, would not bo of much moment to him, "I know something of thnt from the inside," ho said, alluding to tho six weeks he spent in prison for Ws connection with the Trafal gar Square affair. He was glad to learn that the contract convict laDor system was grad ually disappearing. The institutions for youthtul and first offenders ho meant to in spect. American bridges, water-works, parks, and public institutions are also on Mr. Barns' programme for Inspection. Mr. Burns is inclined to believe that among the cosmopolitan American people it was pos sible to bring about concerted action for hold ing the wealthy in check, to prevent them from increasing their holdings as rapidly as heretofore, and he will devote particular at tention to tho study of that problem. But abovo all, ho declared, it was for trade unionism that ho was to work. Ha believed that ultimately tho principles of tho trade union would bo univorally regarded as nec essary for carrying out any movement for human progress. The Pullman strike and the report of the Commissioner of Labor, Mr. Burns deollned to pass an opinion on until he had visited Poll man, which he meant to do. In England tho strike had been watched closely and tho gen eral sentiment, as declared, was that it had been successful. In regard to tho differences arising in the English labor movement Mr. Burns said of courso they prevailed at times, but tho unions were generally all together and had been singularly successful in separating politics Concluded on Second Page.
