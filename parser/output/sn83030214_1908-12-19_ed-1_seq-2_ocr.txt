I will leave the Senate with great regret, as I have enjoyed its duties and associations, and with even" greater reluctance I will lay down the commission of the people of Pennsylvania, who have so splendidly supported me by their approval of my public service." When asked whether he would rather remain in the Senate than accept the Cabinet portfolio. Senator Kncx replied that, never having served mm Secretary of State, he could really make no comparison. . -With m*." he ■■■ "public service is a duty which I accept, not because of any honor which I feel I may derive therefrom, but because I feel that I owe it to ray state and my country. I have, therefore, accepted philosophically the offices which have come to me. being content to remain where I was serving as long as I felt that I was doing my duty as a citizen thereby." Senator KBCS declared that he would have Iwn perfectly content to remain in the Senate, but felt, after discussing The question with a large number of hi* friends, that his duty was to accept Mr. Taft * offer. "It was last Sunday morning in New York City." f&ld Mr. Kncx, -that Mr. Taft put the question to me point blank as to whether I would accept the position. I have thought over it carefully, and at last, having decided that it ■M my duty to accept, I sent to Mr. Taft this afternoon the telegram in which I informed him that I would accept. "N« msn." he oon'inued, "should enter pub lic life lor the sa-ke of the honor which he will Bacaftvw ar which he can draw therefrom.

Relations with Foraker and Indis creet Pledges of Patronage in Ohio the Cause. IFrom The Tribune Bureau.] Washington, Dec. 18.— The friends of Repre sentative Theodore E. Burton, of Ohio, are seri ously concerned over recent developments in his relations with the President -elect. There are certain facts which are known to all Mr. Bur ton's friends. They are that he was- urged by Mr. Taft to accept the Treasury portfolio; that he went to Ohio and told his, friends of the offer, and even went aa far as to pledge certain patronage, apparently with the purpose of furthering his chances of election to the Senate, and finally, that for some reason wholly lnex pli. able to the large majority of their friends the tender nf the Treasury portfolio was withdrawn. The few friends of Mr. Burton who have ar rived at a nearer approach to the true inward ness of the events which led to the withdrawal of Mr. Taffs invitation to the brilliant Ohloan to enter the Cabinet are the more deeply con cerned the further they penetrate. Mr. Burton has long enjoyed the reputation of being far more the statesman than the astute politician, and some of his warmest friends have not hesi tated to assert that in the game of practical pol itics he was a tyro; but that there should be the slightest ground for the belief that he was dis loyal to the President-elect or had shown lack of delicacy in utilizing the confidence of Mr. Taft is the occasion of surprise as great as the regret caused by recent events, and probably no one entertains both sentiments to a greater de pre^ than the future President. Of course, there have been various reports whereby it has been songht to account for the withdrawal of Mr. Taffs tender of the Secre taryship of the Treasury, none of them more wid<» of the mark than that which has attributed to Mr. Taft a purpose to assist the Senatorial candidacy of his brother, < harles P. Taft. Those in a position to s-pcak with authority know that nothing was more earnest and sin cere than Mr. Taffs offer of the Treasury port folio to Mr. Burton, and probably none will be more frank In confessing that fact than Mr. Burton himself. The President-elect even went so far as to urge Mr. Burton seriously to consider the offer, eayinp that he regarded him as a student of financial affairs of more than ordinary ability, that his course in the House had commanded the highest respect, and that in his effort to sur round himself with a Cabinet which would be not only loyal, but composed of men of pre eminent ability, he made no tender with greater earnest and good will. Incidentally, Mr. Taft requested that news of the tender should not be made public for the present. Those of Mr. Burtons friends who have ar rived at the true Inwardness of the situation are all the more amazed, In view of the circum stances related, that he should have entered into a conference, to use no broader term, with Sen ;r r Foraker for the purpose of defeating the candidacy of C. P. Taft and bringing about his own election to the Senate, but those aware of the relations recently established between tlie Ohio Senator and his would-be successor, and of th*> wholesale and unguarded pledges of federal patronage which Mr. Burton has been making in i ihlo, find no difficulty in understanding why Mr. Taft has emphatically, if not peremptorily, withdrawn his offer of a Cabinet place, while those who know the skill of Mr. Foraker as a practical politician and the inability of Mr. Bur ton to cope with the Senator realize that, had not the latter's plans received a sudden check. not only C. P. Taft but Mr. Burton himself would have been defeated for the Senate, with every probability of Mr. Foraker being success ful in thf contest, to take part in which he re cently left Washington for Ohio. This would have been especially likely in view of the un guardM assertions in connection with his brother's candidacy which Mr. Burton was at tributing Jo the President-elect. Those of Mr. Burton's frlfndf- who are in pos session of all the facts fear that he is now des tined to fall between two stools, and the advo cates of the election to the Senate of C. P. Taft | can hardly refrain from a modicum of gratifica tion at the extent to which, according to their i way of putting it. Mr. Burton has overreached | himself. The formal withdrawal of Mr. Taft of ' his offer to Mr. Burton took place in Washing ! ton last Saturday, at an interview which was exceedingly painful for both men. NO 

DEAL, SAYS FORAKER. Denies Combination with Burton in Senatorial Race. f^v Telegraph to The Tribune Cincinnati. Dec. IS.— Senator J. B. Foraker said in an interview here to-night: "I do not care to discuss the Senatorial sit uation; in fact, I do not pretend to know ( much about it. I am reading, however, what ap pears in th* newspapers, and can say that the talk about a combination between Mr. Burton and my.«=olf is al! both. It is a piece off the same cloth from which vas cut the story pub lished broadcast two or three weeks ago that a similar deal had been entered into between Governor Harris iind myself. I have not made any combination with anybody. Nobody has suggested any., such thing to me, and I have not made any such suggestion to any one else. "Each candidate has a perfect right to enter the race, and I suppose each is standing on hi.« own merit, and not expecting support on any other ground. I hope the contest will be friendly and good natured in character, and I am sorry, therefore, to see such attacks on Mr Burton and on Charles P. Taft as have been published recently."

NAME ELIOT PRESIDENT Heads Civil Service Reform League —Resolutions at Pittsburg. Flushing, Dec. IS.— Charles W. Eliot, of Cam bridge. Mass.. was elected president of the National CMi Sen-ice Reform League this afterncon. "With tlie exception of a brief meeting of the executive council, to be held to-morrow morning, the last sessions of the league's twenty-eighth annual -in vention were held to-day tn the rooms of the rittsburg Chamber of Commerce, at which an ad dress wa< made by Attorney General Honaprrte. A dinner was held at tile Hotel Dchenley to-night, at which a number of prominent men spoke. The reports of the officers were made and Civil Service conditions in the dependencies of the L'nited - New York. New Jersey and Pennsylvania were dis cussed. Dr. Willis Fletcher Johnson, president of the New Jersey Civil Service Commission, discussed the progress of Civil Service reform in New Jersey. He said, in part: There are now under the operation of the New Jersey law in state and municipalities nearly eleven thousand officers and employes, with a prospect of half as many more being included be fore your nest yearly meeting. On the whole, the law has thus far worked and is working with gratifying smoothness and efficiency, despite the temporary unfamlllarity of many officials will its provisions. There has been a minimum of friction in its application, and. except in a very few cases of egregious carelessness or perversity, there has been no delay in the certification of payrolls and no interference with the ordinary operations of administration. The testimony has been cordially volunteered by many officials that, instead of com plicating it and making It more burdensome, the law has made their work simpler and easier. In addition to President Eliot, the following of ficers were named this afternoon: Vice-presidents, Edwin A. Alderman, University of Virginia; Joseph H. Choate, New York; Harry A.'Garfield. Will iams-town Mass.; George Gray. Delaware; Arthur T. Iladley. New Haven: Charles E. Hughes. New York, Henry Charles Lea, Philadelphia; Seth Liow. New York; Franklin MaeVeagh, Chicago; George A. Pope, Baltimore; the Rev. P. J. Ryan, D. D., Philadelphia; Moorfleld Storey, Bos-ton; Thomas N. Strong, Portland. Ore., and Herbert Welsh. Philadelphia. : The league. In resolutions adopted late to-day, demands that the 4,000 or more clerks to ha added to the census bureau for the compiling of the next census be "selected for merit and fitness for the work, as determined by competitive examinations," and protests against the proposed non-competitive examination of applicants for such positions which President Roosevelt has described as "nothing but a cloak to hide the nakedness of the spoils sys tem." The resolutions also urge the repeal of the law limiting the tenure of office of subordinate non political employes, and the enactment of a law pro hibiting the soliciting of political contrlbuiions from federal employes by any person or the asking of political services of any sort from any employe in th« classified service. It is also recommended that the. competitive service be extended to include assistant postmasters, employes in non-free delivery postoffices, an employes in the District of Columbia, all pension examining surgeons, and all fourth class postmasters not included in the recent order so soon as arrangements can be made for such extension. Legislation enabling th.=> President to ap ply to Presidential postmasters, collectors and other higher officials regulations similar to those adefpted for consuls in the foreign service was advocated. Eulogistic resolutions were adopted In memory of Daniel Colt Oilman, ex-President Grover Cleve land, Bishop Henry C. Pottter, William Potts and Charles Eliot Norton, former active workers of the league. % The league council, at » session th's evening; elected the following officers: Richard EL Dana, chairman; E. H. Goodman, secretary; Albert de Roode and Charles B. Marble, assistant secre taries; A. S. Prissell. treasurer. 

COUXT'S WIFE, SHE SAYS. Woman Convicted of Stealing Ap peals to Danish Minister. Washington, Dec. 18.— "I am th? wife of Count Brockenhoinus yon Lowenhielm, a Dane, not a Russian, although we were intimate with a number of tho Russian nobility. My hu?ban<l dabbled In Russian politics and had some nar row escapes." This statement was made in the police court here to-day by Mr*. A. L. Rogers, an American, who was convicted of stealing six silver forks while housekeeper at the home of Rail L. Gait, in this city, and sentenced to ninety days in jail in default of $50 fine. The woman, who had suffered keenly, said the charge was a mis take. She appealed to the Danish Minister, who she said knew her. Mrs. Rogers testified that hpr father was a successful businss man,' in Dallas. Tex., where she was married in 1897, and that she was separated from her husband. She afterward tried chicken raising at Laurel, Md., which did not pay, and she became a housekeeper. "My husband kissed me one morning, walked out of the door, and I have never seen him since," she said. CAXXOX TO HIS CRITICS. Defends Speakership Against Usur pation — Fling at Newspapers. Philadelphia, Dec. IS— .Joseph G. Cannon, Speaker of tlie national House of Representatives, In an address at the annual dinner of the New Jersey Society of Pennsylvania her* to-nipht. aroused his hearers by taking an unexpected fling at his critii-s and defending his policies and the manner in which tlie House was ruled at the last session. Mr. Cannon said: <* Fear comes to the timid man temporarily in vested with power who wants to retain that power and listen to the improper proposals from without, and does not make a protest founded on high re solves crossed with splendid courage and a desire to do right. Away with that old story of one-man power and czarism! Franklin made a protest against the veto power of the Executive being made absolute, and he was right. In the chapter of accidents I became Speaker of the House. When the minority undertook to con trol the majority they were met with a refusal from the majority and the Speaker. The Speaker would have been like a cat in liell without claws if lie had not fought against such usurpation. - Rules are formulated for the government of the House. Those rules were right and proper. Under them the House wrote wise and proper leg'slatlve measures on the statute, books. There ww« wild howls from partially selfish newspapers and magazines because the Cr.ar did not remove 16 per cent nd valorem duty on print paper and wood pulp. They said they wanted it removed because the cost, of print paper an i wood pulp had Increased 50 per cent, but they could not show that the Increase was du>« to Cue duty, and th. Speaker refused to allow the duty to be re moved. Mr. Cannon turned to Vice- President-elect James S. Sherman, v.-lio was a {ruest with him at the function, and continued: "They were ashamed to explain that this was the real reason for their pounding during your campaign and mine. They forgot that the Speaker could be removed ajty day or bom. They forgot that nothing could i»* .],,!*. without the will of the majority.

Senator McCarren was received with much ap plause, and said: I hope that I will not be considered disrespectful if I refuse to deposit my ballot to-night. 1 want to look over the field a little further. 1 have been asked to speak upon the principles that should De followed In selecting a man as Mayor. My political training has Inspired me with a belief in three tests. Is the man honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the constitution? . I believe that your example in holding these meetings could well be emulated, They are • evi denei or civic pride and duty, and that must benefit our city government. We are gradually _" ear ' * the ideality in the minds of our best citizens, not only here, but in all parts of the '•° l ' ntr > r - , n . nlft .

I know that Mr. Bryan nominated himself, wrote his own platform and. even less condescending than Mr. Roosevelt, selected his own running mate too So in the conduct of both parties these two men were absolute, showing the trend Of SBB timent toward Increasing the powers of the loader. Mr. Taft called attention to the difference be tween our government and that of England. There the Prime Minister resigns if Parliament does not do what h* wants. If Congress rejects the pro posed tariff revision. Mr. Taft will not resign. Neither will the Congressmen nor the Senators, Once two Congressmen did resign because Con gress aid not do what they wanted, and returned to their constituent.- for indorsement, and they were not indorsed.

The result of the recent election justifies the opinion that Independent move ments are not in the healthiest condition just now. Senator McCarren was greeted with laughter when be said he did not hold a brief for any po litical boss, and added that his political associa tions had got him into a great deal of trouble. Then he said: In his recent address in Manhattan Governor Hughes spoke on "Civic Righteousness, to wnieti we al' subscribe. Governor Hughes lias endeavored to carry out the great duties of his office within his lights. A man who expects to be sleeted must hope for the majority of the votes Governor Hughes's nomination was deemed nec essary to Mr. Taft'S election In this state. HIS nomination was dictated by the same influence that dictated Mr Taffs nomination. The friends of Mr. Hughes contended that l. possessed all the civic virtues. Then came the election. Mr. Taft, for whose sake Governor Hughes was renominated, ran 123,000 votes ahead of him and Mr. White, the personification of political machine work in the popular mind, ran ,■>."'•" ■. cad of him. If this liad been an off year it is said that Mr. Hughes would have been defeated. So the selec tion of a leader does not always work so success fully as we are inclined to hope. We are liable to wrongly read public sentiment. If th" several hundred men in this audience were called upon to give tests for selecting a candidate they would probably give several hundred answers. Nobody doubts the civic virtues of ex-Mayor Seth Low but he was beaten when he ran for re-elec tion by 60.000 votes. When he was sleeted the first time his opponent was that personification of civic virtue Edward M- Bhepard. if the foresight of the voters bad been as goo.i as their hindsight they might have chosen Mr. Shepard Instead of Mr. I,ow.

DEMOCRACY TO HANG OX. Will Have Permanent Headquarters Soon, Says Mack. Norman K.

Saw T«* JUDGE GARY'S \VARXL\G Continued from flr»t ps*e. at which the competitors of the Steel Corpora tion can produce rails. He said that the United States Steel Corporation produced about 50 per cent of th© steel rails manufactured in the l«t five years He gave the prices of rails in foreign cam tries. The domestic price in Germany, M said, is $23 02 a ton. and the export pr 522 20:. la Great Britain. $27 M and $23 «1: In France than) is a difference of $S. "They do in Europe as they do here." said tt» witness. "They dump their surplus in foref^a markets when business is dull in their own." Judge Gary suggested that It probably woafct prove of value for the committee to i rv»«tigste the "countervailing- tax" in force in Canada. "With such a system." he said, "if G«» r many, for instance, has a surplus In a product and sells it in this country it a price not in heap* 1 wia the cost of production, It -would be possibls t» impos* a tax or duty that would prevent thrfr dumping their surplus in the American mark»f "We wouldn't need so nigh a duty then, either?" asked Mr. Crumpacker. The wttnea assented, adding that he favored a maximta and minimum tariff. ■ At another point Judge Gary said that tae average mill price on rails for export is I\% p«? cent less than th» domestic price. Representative Clark asked why the Americaa manufacturers did not sell the surplus in tbs home market, suggesting that railroads which buy Iron instead of steel rails then wou'd b* able to buy the latter because of cheaper prices. "No railroad that is aDle to pay $25 a ton ttnr rails has gone without them because they c«*st $2*." replied the witness. "I think this question should be approached from a different stand point. I don't think that a manufacturer, on account of the tariff or anything els* should get more than a fair return on his investment. If he doesn't charge a fair pries he ought to be compelled to sell for less." Mr. Clark asked how Judge Oary proposed tn prevent the manufacturers from charging a price that gave them more than a fair return on their investment. "By publicity and government control of the manufacturers." he replied, adding that he was merely giving his personal opinion. Earlier Judge Gary gave the cost of manufact uring pig iron at $15 30 a ton. Mr Payn* caUed his attention to trie figures supplied to the bu reau of corporations by the Steel Corporation, giving the cost of producing pig iron at Jl4 0I The witness said these figures wer» for IS3* to ISM, while the figures he gave w»re for last year when the mills were not running at full time* and the cost of everything was higher. "The cost of ore has been increasing a!I th« time," he said, "this betas due to the decree ia the percentage of iron in the ore." DENIES CONTROLLING PRICES. "Is it true that the United Stare 3 Steel-Cer poration fixes the price of steel and Steel prod ucts?" asked Mr. Clark. "Certainly not." • Then how !.-< it tor some yea back th* pries of steel rails has been $-£ a. ton?" •'The price was fixed in 133? at a conferer.es of steel manufacturers, and with the advice of possibly a few railroad companies as to what would be a fair price for rail?. Since that time the steel rr.anuficturrrs ':■: ■ ■*•• adhered to that price, and I doubt if any of them would e'nanga It without informing the others. They fears so agreement and do not hay»» any meeting?. I believe this adherence to the >a# price is t*:» result of the knowledge which each of them haa of the other's busines.-, dne t-> publicity. Every one seems satisfied that the price is a fair on?. Isn't it true th-^t- you have such a control of the industry that if you rixed the price none s£ the independent manufacturers would dare to set a price below yours '" anked Mr Clark. "That may be true as far as stee! rails ars concerned." Judge Gary replied, but qualified h^ answer by saying he did not mean that the steel corporation has a hold on the industry, bet that the independents -.^cognized the adrisabi.lty of maintaining one price. "Suppose the United States Steel Corporation put the price up to $30 ■: t»n. «1o you thir.k ther* is an independent manufacturer who wouldat mark his price up to $30 a ton because you nal marked yours up?" _ "I can't say." was th« reply, "except tnat » think they would mark the price up." _ Judge Gary acknowledged that the Steel Car* poration could driv* the independents out cf business In a competition, because th» Steel cor poration can produce rails cheaper than the in dependents. He said that the Steel Corporataa could not survive In the tinpla: industry *j**? out a tariff, possibly less thai the present *■• on this article. Representative Clark wanted to know -no* much profit the United States Steel Corporauon Is making. Judge Gary said that the »r.ters* paid amounted to
