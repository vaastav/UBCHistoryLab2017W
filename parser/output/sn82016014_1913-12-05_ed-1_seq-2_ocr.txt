(Continued from Pr On- time provide; and bo to provide (b) that all delegates from any state may be chosen from the state at large, or part from the state at large and part from congressional districts, .in con formity with the laws of the state in which the election occurs? In considering subdivision "A" of the question, rule 12, adopted by the conventions of 1908 and 1912, is quoted as follows: Rule 12 Quoted. "Such committee shall issue the call for the meeting of the national conven tion within 60 days, at least, before the time fixed for said meeting, and dele gates to the national convention qhall be chosen In such manner as the na tional committee shall provide." Upon this point the committee say3 It is its opinion "that it is at the prwj-' ent time within the power of the na tional committee to prescribe, as did the call Issued by the committee for the convention of 1912, the manner cf i choosing both delegates at large and district delegates to the future national conventions; and that the national committee may provide,- in --all Issued for future conventions, that delegates at large, and from congressional dis tricts, may be chosen -ti conformity with the laws of the 'state in which the election occurs, and may alter the manner of choosing such delegates as occasion may require so as to conform with such laws as the several states may enact from time to time." Subdivision "S" of this second' ques tion Is: , . ' "Has the national committee author ity to change the manner and method of choosing delegates to future nation al conventions so as to provide that all delegates from any state may be chosen from the state at large; or part of the state at large and part from congres sional districts in conformity with tfce laws of the state in which the election occurs?" Committee Is Barred. The opinion cites the rules adopted by past national conventions providing for the election of delegates from each congressional district and says no ques tion would arise as to whether or not the national committee possessed the power to alter the manner of choosing delegates to the national conventions so as to abolish congressional district rep resentation "were it not for the word ing of rule 12 as adopted by the con ventions of 1908 and 1912. "The provision of rule 12, now under consideration, as adopted by the con vention of 1908 is (official proceedings, page 111): " 'Such committee (national commit tee) shall issue the call for the meet ing of the national convention within sixty days at least before the time fixed for said meeting and delegates to the national convention shall be chosen In such manner as the national com mittee shall provide.' " The opinion continues: "The facts recited from the histdry of the party show that the position of the party Is in favor of representation from congressional districts. Nevertheless the elimination from the rules adopted by the convention of 1908 and 1912 of all reference either to delegates from congressional districts, or to delegates at large, and the elimination of the provisions, found in former rules, pre scribing the manner of electing dele gates, left, according to the terms of the rules, the national commHtee y mm ounho and Colds Fcrercn Sickness mi should have immediate efllrlmt traataaat wttk SCOTTS DTOISI0H harsnst physical power is rasaced ar tha cold woald mot exist.

The opinion aeciares: "The method provided can proper ly be unvoked for the purpose of calling a special convention, and it is the opinion of your committee that the national committee has authority to call a special national convention." The fourth question considered is: "If the national committee should decide to call a special convention, what would be a legal form for tha call to be issued by the national com mittee?" On this the opinion reads: "In such case the national commit tee could direct the chairman and sec retary of the committee to issue a call; within sixty days at least before the time fixed, for a national con vention of delegated representatives of the party; such call to state: Most Follow State Laws. "1. The time, place and purpose of such convention. "2. That such convention shall consist of four delegates-at-large from each state; two delegates-at-large for each representative-at-large in con gress from each state; two delegates from each congressional district; six delegates each from Hawaii and Alaska; two delegates each from the District of Columbia, Porto Rico and the Philippine islands; that for each delegate chosen an alternate delegate shall be chosen in the same manner and at the same time to act in the absence of the delegate. That delegates-at-large, and congressional dis trict delegates, shall be chosen in each state in such manner as the Re--publican state committee of the state in which the election occurs shall di rect; provided, however, that if in any state, which has provided by law for the election of all delegates to a na tional convention from the state at large, all delegates shall .be elected in accordance with such law, or shall be chosen from the state at large, the na tional committee will place the names of such delegates on the temporary roll of the convention. "3. A method for the election of delegates from tha District of Colum bia, the territories' and the territorial possessions. "4.

Congress May Act. Washington, Dec 5. The Issue of direct presidential primaries, brought Into public discussion by President Wilson's message promises to be an important factor in deliberations of the Republican national committee here December 16. Many believe congress may provide primaries that will do away with the need of any nominating conventions before the next presidential election. The decision of the law committee of the Republican national committee just made public leaves but one im portant change in Republican rules to be made by a national convention. That relates to the basis of representa tion. While Republican leaders here be lieve the national committee will call a convention for March or April some thought the direct primary plan might influence some committeemen against it. It was pointed out that if a di rect primary law were passed before the 1916 elections the need for a change of Republican representation would disappear.
