Merchants, financiers, and business men of all political parties express ap proval of the President's message. The Republicans will, after January 1st, have 16 Governors, again of two, and 19 State Legislatures, a gain of four. The next House of Representa tives will consist of 184 Democrats and 141 Republicans. Mr. Speaker Carlisle, the free trader, is already tssured of his re-election. The illuminations and jubilations at the South, in honor of Democratic success, continues from day to day. It is the first time the South has had a chance for a real old-fashioned hur rah since it tried to break loose from the Union. The Electoral Colleges of the sev eral States met last week Wednesday and cast their votes for President and Vice President. Blaine and Logan re ceived 182 votes," and Cleveland and Hendricks 219. This purely formal declaration of a result already known attracts but little attention, domina ting conventions have usurped the du lies intended to be performed by the Electoral College, and a reform that would do away with this clumsy and unnecessary system would be gladly welcomed. There are now in the Senate 38 Re publicans, 36 Democrats and 2 Read justers, Mahone and Riddleberger, After the 4th of next March the Sen ate will be more decidedly Republi can. -Farley, from California, and Slater, from Oregon, both Democrats, will be succeeded by Republican Sen ators. The elections in the other States that choose Senators next winter will not effect the relative par ty representation in the Senate, un less Illinois, whose Legislature is al most exactly divided between the two parties, elects a Democrat in the place of Gen. Logan. It is possible that no Senator will be chosen by the Leg islature elect. In that case Gen. Lo gan would doubtless have a majority in the next Legislature. But even with a Democratic Senator lrom Illi nois in place of Logan, the Senate for two years from the 4th of March next will contain thirty-nine Republi cans; Mahone and Riddleberger, of Virginia, who have acted with the Republicans, and thirty-five Demo crats. The terms of Fair, of Neva da, and Mahone, of Virginia, will end with the Senate beginning the 4th of March, 1887. Fair, who is a Demo crat, is likely to be succeeded by a Republican. Mahone's place may or may not be filled by a Democrat. If it isr the two parties will remain in e same relative strength in the Sen ate the last two, as they will be in the first two years of Mr. Cleveland's term. "" Mrs. James IT. PolT who 'Is now- 81 years of age, recently speaking of the time wuen sue was lady, of the White House, said that she enjoyed that period of her life, and looked back upon it after 40 yeare with pleas ure. She is fond of recalling inci dents or Mr. Polk's administration, ' and is proud of his career. She says she regards the annexation of Texas and the results following the Mexican war, that is, the acquirement of the Californias. New Mexico, and all those Territories so rich in mineral ore, as some of the most important ' events in the history of this country. In fact, she thought Mr. Polk's ad ministration was second to none, and she would not even except the results obtained by Mr. Jefferson. She says history i3 now proving be advantages gained by these accessions, all due to Mr. Polk's administration. It is reported from Chicago that Mr. Brand is disgusted with politics and will not contest the disputed sen atorial seat. In view of the foul work that, seemingly, was done iu his name, no homrable man could take any other course. By contest ing the scat, the Senator non-elect would have burned his fingers. As it is, he may be regarded as "a brand plucked from the burning." The organ of the Independents in Massachusetts, the Boston Ilerald, seems to jise . to the situation quite sensibly, when it tells the Indepen dent Republicans what they have done in the following words : It must be understood that the administration which is to come in by the aid of In dependent votes is a Democratic ad ministration. It is understood in Utah that the first step which the Democrats will take, when (bey once obtain full power, will be to ' admit Utah as a State. This would give two-United States Senators' and a'dcT"sITghfly to their strength in the lower House. The Mormons are all Democrats. .

The question of allowing school children to attend roller skating rinks has been settled at St. Johnsbury by auowing scnoiars to attend on Satur day afternoon only. Hon. Seneca M.

"I At noon to-day both houses of Con gress were called to order by their re spective presiding officers, and the work of the secoud session of the forty-eighth Congress was at once en tered upon. Thousands filled the gal leries, while other thousands, unable to obtain entrance, filled the halls and lobbies. For an hour or more be fore the houses were called to or der, the scene on the floors was of a most lively and interesting character. As Senators or Representatives came in they were greeted most cordially by their brother members, and one could hardly imagine that for more than five months many of those en gaged in earnest, hearty greeting, and the interchange of earnest, honest civilities, had been charging each oth er with every conceivable crime or sin of omission and that in a few days again, even on these very floors where so much honest, hearty, whole-souled welcomes are being extended, they would be indulging in like charges of wrong It is certainly a cause of congratu lation to know that while political dif ferences are so great, and the discus sions of these questions are so bitter at times, our law-makers do not per mit these differences to interfere with their personal relations, and that there is a generous admiration for each other existing between manyr if not all of them. There are but few changes in either Youse. In the Senate, the saddest is that caused by the death of the yen erable and venerated Senator An thonv, of Rhode Island, and on the House side, the man who will be most missed will be Hon. W. H. Calkins, of Indiana, who resigned to accept the Republican nomination for Gov ernor. He was a conspicuous figure, embodying not only a perfect ideal of a man phjsically, but intellectually and socially. After the calling of the roll com mittees were appointed to wait upon the President, who, a't 12.30, sent in his message, the reading of which was at once entered upon, and upon its conclusion both Houses adjourned. The reception tendered Gen. John A. Logan and his most estimable wife on Saturday evening last, was one of the handsomest testimonials to sterling worth, pure patriotism and lofty public and private character, ever tendered in this city. It was a grand ovation paid by their personal friends, regardless of political opin ions or prejudices, on their return to the city. The spacious parlors of the General's residence on Iowa Circle, was crowded for two hours or more by the thousands of those who admire the General and his wife in all the walks of lite. They have a warm place in the hearts of all who have manly and womanly worth. Some penny-a-liners here have start ed the word that the Republican Sen ate will resist Cleveland s appoint ments outside of his immediate advis ers the Cabinet Ministers. This is the sheerest fol-de-rol in the world. The Senate will give the new adminis tration a fair trial, and oppose no reasonable changes. The right of the President to put men at the heads Of bureaus and in the chief offices who are in sympathy with him politically is recognized. A determined stand will, however, be taken by Republi cans against any attempt to repeal the civil service law, or to make it pf no effect, unless a better measure is offered to take its place. For the first time since July, 1879, the monthly public debt Btatem$n snows an increase. xnis is occa sioned by the amounts advanced to pension agents for the December pay ment, which amounts to $8,000,000, the December 1st interest nmountJ which amounts to $2,230,864 and a" decrease in the receipts for the month of $4,000,000. The treasury surplus is $141,000,900. Maj. Ben. Perley Poore, the veter an Washington correspondent, ; is writing a book entitled "Sixty Years at the Capital." A portion of the work, which is to be published by a Philadelphia subscription-book pub lishing house, is already in press. Now, if ex-Senator Tabor, of Colo rado, could be induced to put his lour weeks' experience in the Senate into print, with Maj. Poore's book, and Mr. Blaine's ''Twenty Years in Con gress, the public would be well able to judge how different lengths of ser vice in Washington politics effects a man. Last winter Congress appropriated twenty-five thousand dollars to assist in defraying the expenses of the cere monies attending the dedication of the Washington Monument, and fixed the 22d -. of February, 1885, as the time for the event. It appears that none of our wise legislators have con suited the almanac, a3 Washington': birth day next year falls on Sundav It will be necessary for Congress dur ing us present session to correct lb matter by fixing another date. The cap-stone of the monument will be set some time during the present week which will be a substantial completion oi tne structure. ! The House Appropriations Commit tee was in session, a good deal of the time last week, and as a consequence it nas its worn pretty well advanced Several bills will be readv. before the holiday recess, and the remainder will be presented soon thereafter. A bill will Boon be lntrodnced in the House, by Representative Follett providing for the abolition of thopres- ent system of deputy marshals: and supervisors of election. MrFojlett will also introduce a resolution callins upon the committee of expenditures in tne uepartment or Justice to in vestigate the conduct of United States marshals and their deputies at tne late elections in Uhio. Secretary Lincoln took occasion in his annual report to rap Chief Signal Umcer tiazen over the knuckles for his persistence in going out of his way in his report and trenching upon the prerogatives of the War Depart ment to niae tauits in the manage ment of the Signal Service Bnrean If Gen. IJazen were not held in check a little, he would entirely neglect Lis own Dusiness and try to manage ev erybody else's. A large number of Southern Mem. bers of Congress will urge that the usual holiday recess be made to be gin early enough to permit Senators ana Members to attend the New Or leans Exposition. As the time fixed ior tne opening is the 16th inst., it would make the holiday recess unu sually long and weaken the hopes that many members have of reachine and transacting a good deal of legislation, wmcn n is uesireu shall be put through at this session. Speaker Carlisle has announced himself as opposed to anv such early adjournment. It is stated that the President has consented to formally onen the New Oi leans Exposition, and that most of his Cabinet will accompany him on that mis-iion to the Crescent City on 16rh the inst. ." '.en. West Randolph In Flames. An extensive fire visited West Ran dolph on Saturday, the 6th. It caught in the basement of W. E. Lamson's furniture store. Tne alarm was promptly given and Fountain Engine Co. promptly responded. It was at first thought the fire could be con trolled, but the oils and inflammable material carried the flames into the partitions and the building was doomed. It was at once cleared as well as possible. The adjoining stores of J. D. Mitchell and N. M. Draper on the north, and E. A. Thomas, J. G. Mann & Co., H. M. Wires, etc., were cleared out, as it was evident nothing could be saved. The stores of Tewksbury & Sons, Samuel Bass DuBoi3 & Gay's block were hastily protected as well as possible and in the end, by hard fighting, saved. The fire soon spread to the French block and from that to S. M. Flint's block. An effort was made to check the fire on the Blue Store, but without suc cess. Aid was summoned from North field, Montpelier and South Royalton. The Central Vermont railroad prompt ly sent special trains for these engines. The South Royalton company, and a fine one, too, was there in 18 minutes after leavins home. In spite of all exertions the flames burned the en tire square between Main and Pleas ant streets and Merchant s row, in cludes the Cottage hotel. The ag gregate loss cannot be far from $75, 000, and it is a severe blow to the prosperity of the village, but the bus iness men are plucky, and the work of re-buildmg will soon be commenced. Mr. Dodge, of the Cottage hotel, tel egraphed for a contractor and archi tect before his building was in ashes, and will at once re-build, probably a large brick house, such as the place has always needed. He has set a good example to the other business men. 

NOTES. Instruction in sewing was intro duced in the Philadelphia public schools last week. The free text book experiment ic Massachusetts is said to be a success. It has resulted in a larger attendance in the schools, and is more economi cal than the old system. A company in New Jersey i3 mak ing counterpanes and pillow shams of paper, which retail at seventy-five cents a set. "I never argy agin success, says Artemus Ward. "When I see a rat tlesnaix's hed sticking out of a hole, I bear off to the left, and says I to myself, that hole belongs to that snaix." At the crysanthemumm show in New York, one of the most curious exhibited was by Julius Scharoff, a Japanese variety. The blossom showu was about five inches in diameter, the quilled ravs of a dark rose color. curved and twisted with the tips point ins in all directions, making of it a marked flower. The paper shirt has been introduced. The bosom of this novel garment con sists of several layers, of which one can be torn off every day, on the blotting pad principle, exposing a clean white surface in its place. The Salvation Army have been la boring in New London, Conn, ' They billed the town in this way : "Hello ! Who is this? Why, Kansas Jack, the saved desperado, who will swoop down on us and lasso as many of the devil's braves as possible. But who is this lellow? Captain Walsh, the converted minstrel, who will speak, play and sing for the glory of God and tbe good of your soul , TUe best thing out. Take it all in:" During the year of 1882 an aggre gate of 156,499,000 tons of coal were brought to the surface in Great Brit ain, of which quantity. 99,189,000 tons were applied to mechanical pur poses, and 57,309,800 tons were em ployed for heating purposes only The number of tons devoted to van ous specific objects was as follows paper making and tanning, , 939,000 tons: water works, 2,191,000 tons breweries and distilleries, 2,817,000 tons ; railways, 3.130,000 tans ; steam navigation, 4,oyo,UUU tons; gas navigation, 9,390,000 tons ; coal ex ported, 14,398,000 tons; iron and steel works, 46,9o0,000 tons ; domes tic use, 26,918,000. The most remarkable piece of tel ephoning yet attempted has just been accomplished by the engineers of the International Bell Telephone Co., who successfully carried out an expen ment by which they were enabled to hold a conversation between St. Pe tersburg and Bologne, a distance of 5.465 miles. Blake transmitting and Bell receiving instruments were used and conversation was kept up, not withstanding a rather high induction The experiments were carried on dur ing the night when the telegraph lines were not at work. I he Russian en gineers of this company are so con fident of further success that they nope shortly to be able to converse with ease at a distance of 4,665 miles but to accomplish this astonishing feat they must combine all the condi tions favorable for the transmission of telephonic sounds. If it is found possible to hold audible conversation at such extraordinary distances, it is possible that this fact will be speedily improved upon, and it will be possible to converse freelv between London and New York, and by and by be tween London and the antipodes.
