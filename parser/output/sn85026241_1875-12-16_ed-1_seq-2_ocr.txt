BEtMDE STaiURSPAV OEC 10. 1876. The Democrats in Congress are pro ceeding with great caution. Not one of them dare "open his inouth for fear of putting Lis loot in it." Fernandy tried it once, bnt it wasn't a encccm. Fob a dead party we confess the Democratic Organization displays heap of vitality. Its head, Tweed, is off and yet it asks: "What are you going to do about it?" The Democratic leaders are very much afraid the party in Congress can not control itself; hence they propose to caucus, then lay down a policy, and require every member to adhere to it. When the head of the Democratic jjarty, Tweed, seated himself on bhlp- board. it is said he once more rxclaim ed, "farewell a lone farewell to all my grate ness," and "I'll just wait for the thing to blow over." - So it turns out that Mr. Adams, the Clerk of the Democratic House of Rep reeentatives, was a " salary grabber, " partook ot the "back-pay steal," and so on. This is a specimen of the reform spirit which be Democrats bring in It costs the people of Ohio $22,026 to advertise the Constitutional Amend ments submitted at the recent election Add to this the; increased cost of the Supreme Court Commission provided for in one of these amendments, and u?n will have a neat little sum of not less than $75,000 useless expenditure, for which the late economical Demo cratic Legislature U responsible.

"Establish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to the ed ucation of all the children." Presi- tlent GranCt Message. The new Postmaster of the House Reoresentatives at Washington, is man of many trials and sore tribula tions. He has received sucln kindly consideration at the hands of Capt Sherwood, his predecessor, that he loth to part company with him. Five hundred applicants to be appointed subordinate positions under him have been disappointed, mainly because they had not served in the Confederate arm v. The few who have succeeded iu getting appointments took the qual ified oath of office, and are correspond ingly happy. Ex-Senator Henderson who has been assisting the U. S. District Attor ney at St. Louis, in the trials of the conspirators to defraud the revenue, his speech in the Avery case, made some very unjust reflections upon the President. The passages referred represent the President as interfering to prevent the then Commissioner Internal Revenue, Douglass, from per forming his duty in regard to the whis ky frauds. Upon being satisfied that this unprofessional attack had been made by one of the counsel for the United States, Attorney General Pier- pont directed Dyer, the U. S, Attorney at St. Louis, to dispense with the ser vices of Henderson,, and to retain his place the ablest counsel that could find, without regard to politics. An eminent Democratic lawyer of L'iuis, named Glover, was tendered .- Appointment, but declined saying that "conflicting proiessionai engagements prevented him from accepting. It is understood that the President ardent in his demand for counsel who ' should be absolutely in the dichare of the duties attending his omeei and would not be satisfied with anything short ot the uioKt vigorous and impar- ' tial prosecution of the work entrusted by the government to his hands. , we suggest that this is the same Henderson who was a Republican Sen . utor tip to Missouri, and -voted against the impeachment of Johnson. This may account for his abuse of President (J rant. Taxing Church Property. In the President's reeommendation of an amendment to the Constitution tax church property, he states his be . lief th.it in 18.50 the valuation of this . properly which paid no tax was about 83 millions; "in 1SG0 the amount hud doubled" s;y 1C6 millions ; "in 1875 is about 1,000 millions." This estimate makes the amount in 1875 more than six tiras as great as in 18G0, whereas the previous decade it had only doubl ed, and more than three times as great as shown by the census of 1S70. If the amount has tripled in the last five year., the estimate that it will be tripl ed again by the year I9W supposes preatly decreaoed rate or accumulation. The President's estimate for this time supposes that about one-eleventh of the valuo of rrtd estate in the whole coun try is in church property. This is very iarge exaggeration. Yet the amount and its increase is worthy grave-consideration by those who con- control this exempt property. The ox emotion of church property has to made up by higher tnxes on other prop erty, and thus people are in a measure taxed to support churches a thiog -tt men our lonsiuuiioD forbids. While our Constitutional Convention was in session, this question wasagitat- ed, and this journal advocate the tax ing of all property equally; but the proposition had very little snpport from the religious societies. The affair do not call fjr a constitutional revo lution of tho government transferring local taxation from States to the Na tional Government, but it is a matter . worthy of serious consideration. The (-Hate governments are the proper agen cies of the people to carry out this re form. Our form of government pro ides peaceable ways for such a change. Th9 people have only to will it. In other countries the history of accurau ' lations of exempt property in the hands or religious societies seems to have its natural ending in its appropriation by ihe State.

A Democratic pa per says: "The prin cipals of the time honored party are eternal and briug enlarged liberty to all." Certainly. That's what Tweed said when the Democratic officials al lowed him to escape his just punish' ment at Sing Sing. The St. Louis Globe-Democrat in re ferring to the dismissal of Henderson ascounsed for the Government in the St. Louis whiskey cases, very truly aysr"The President, or the Attorney General acting for the President, did no more than any private citizen, similarly placed, would have done he declined to retain in his employment a man who bad traveled a long distance out of his way to abuse him. - He in jected a stump speech into the belly of bis areument.and after inveighing very snarpiy again! tne tyranny oi parly, illustrated mat tyranny at tne expense oi the resident's integrity of char acter and purpose." The irruption of Texans and Vir ginians into Washington city, hunting for office in the Democratic House, said to be frightful. New England and New York have both to stand out of the way, and no Democrat can obtain an office who does not possess the lank jaws of the hungry Virginian, or who does not talk like a plantation slave. The Washington Star says that "Vir ginia has swooped down upon the of fices in a way that puts, not only New England, but all the other States of the Union out in the cold. Not since the days of the war when Confederate prisoners were marched through the streets, has there been such an irrup tion of gaunt, hungry Virginians.

"TRAMP" QUESTION. State Convention in Columbus. Ohio, to Consider the Evil. S. of a Is to iu to of In answer to a call of the City Coun cil of Lima, a State convention to con sider the "tramp" question was held at Columbus on Wednesday of last week Resolutions were adopted declaring that a large class of persons exist Ohio who properly belong to the va grant class, and who live by begging. that this is a growing evil that must be eradicated by furnishing employ ment to thisclass of such a character or to make their labor remunerative, To this end the plan of establishing workhouses in all citks and towns suf ficiently large to maintain them is re commended and additional legislation by which any district composed of one or more townships may be authorized to erect such houses, or to form a chain gang, is to De as ted for. That mag- grants, and upon conviction to commit them to these work houses, that th system of work houses to be effective must be extended over the whole State, that the furnishing of free transports tion to tramps from one point to an other be dispensed with; that the pro per authorities should be authorized to employ persons committed to the workhouses on the public highway or at other labor outside the workhouse property. in he St. the , is to it in a a of be Much information ot a varied char acter is to be obtained by putting to gether the observations the of Opposi tion papers on the President's Message, We learn in this way that the Messag is written by Senator Morton, Secre tary Fish and Private Secretary Bab cock; and is in Grant's usual clumsy English, which expresses itself main strength and awkwardness. We learn that it is the most crafty and far reaching bid for a Third Term that ever a politicand longheaded man like Grant put together ; and it is crude, un sophisticated and innocent as the first pleading call of the new born mutton for its mother. We learn that ft dis graces American statesmanship and endangers our foreign relations by in sisiing witn needless obstinacy upon the President's well known partiality tor Cuba; and it shows beyond doubt that the wisdom and good sense of the crafty old premier have overruled the obstinate desire of the President to em broil us with Spain, every line of the discussion of the Cuban question being so obviously from the pen of the Secre tary of State as to make it usele&s to discuss the point We learn that all that part of the Message which discuss es the School question is contributed by Senator Morton; and the fact that there is not a single wave of the bloody shirt from end to end of the Message shows that the President has broken away from Morton's influence, and did not consult that custodian of the san guinary garment as to anything in Hie Message. We learn that the .Message is the weakest that ever was sent from the Executive Chair, and the strongest yet written by the impenetrable Silent Man who is gradually gathering us all into civil handcuffs, after the manner of the Great Cesar. And so on. To us, we confess all these strainings of the brethren seem melancholy bosh, and the Message seems the plain sim pie utterance of the most sincere and straightforw ard man who ever distract ed craft by the plain dealing. It is the thoughtful and earnest product of mind which sees straight to the front without hint of fo or refraction from fancy or imagination. If it is not statesmanlike and patriotic, then the war was fought and our most urgent need was served without either patriot ism or statesmanship. O. 8. Journal.

MESSAGE. Comments of the Leading Journals of the Country Thereon. From the Chicago Tribune, (Rep.) The public have been led to expect hat President Grant's message this ear would be the ablest Executive document of all that he has prepared uring his two terms. A careful read ing of the message seems to justify the expectation that has been made, and a pretense ot serious disappointment in ny quarter will be captious, partisan. unreasonable. It may be said in gen eral terms that it takes a broad, com prehensive, national, aud statesmanlike view of the subjects it treats, and no where degenerates iuto the spirit of merepartyia:n. . Its tone is essentially patriotic, without once abandoning that moderation which should charac terize self-government, and the swell ing pride of a review of a century's progress unparalleled in the history of nations is tempered by a timeiy wani ng against the dangers that threaten the republic There has perhaps never been an epitome ot our growth, and commercial, industrial, mining, aud manufacturing progress, which com prehended ho much in a few words as the centennial review with which the President has appropriately introduced his seventh annual message. First among the dangers against which he warns the people is tbatot the exces sive power that may be assumed in a popular government by the educated few over the uneducated masses, and he believes that the time has come when there should he national meas ures providing lor a Mrady and sys tematic eradication of that ignorance which betrays the masses into the wiles of the demagogue or the oppres sion of the despot. Iu approaching this suliject he has careiuny avoided tne expression of any ideas that can reason ably give offense to any class or sect, and there is not the slightest sugges tion of an auti-Gntholic movement, which had been foreshadowed by some of the Democratic newspapers. We commend the faith! u perusal ot t.ie messoge 'a all our readers, witn the Mssurauce that they will be repaid by its dignity of tone, intelligence in expression, broadness of view, and thorough appreciation of the live ques tions ot the day. Boston Globe, (Ind. Rep.) I' he seventh annual message of Pres ident Grant is a document winch will be read with great interest and prolw blv meet with very general approba tion on account of its calm and moder ate tone and the wisdom of its sugges tions. He departs somewhat from the well-worn paths of discussion and gives proiuiueuce to a fresh subject in his re commendations regarding education and the churches. Every thinking cit izen will appreciate the lorce aud truth of his remarks upon the importance ot a general diffusion ot eaucaiK u in a Republic, where the well being of the community and of the nation depeuds so largely upon the intelligence and sense of responsibility ot tne individual citizens. It is a matter of so much mo ment that his suggestion of a Constitu tional amendment requiring each State lo maintain free schools lor the educa tion of all children, irrespective cf sex, Cijlor, birthplace or religion, is quite justified. The proposition that no per son should be allowed to become a voter after 1890 unless he can read aud write. is also a good one and could not fail to have a salutary effect if carried into ex ecution. The States being required to afford sufficient facilities to all persons to rjuuir the rudiments of education for teu years or more prior to that date, there would be no excuse for any per son who should fail to acquire the qual ifications for the franchise. The prop osition that the amendment to the Constitution should also prohibit the teaching of religious, atheistic or pagan tenets iu the public schools and the ap propriation of any money raised by taxation for the benefit of any sectarian object, is calculated to set at rest on perfectly just and equitable grounds a mischievous agitation. On the whole the .message touches upon all matters of present national concern in a very sensible way; and if not brilliant production is. what is much better, a useful and suggestive one, Chiago Inter-Ocean, (Rep). In 'most respects it will receive the earnest commendation of Republicans. The recommendations in favor of more general and even a compulsory sy.-tem of free education ; of the prohi bition ot the teaching of sectarian doctrines in the common schools ; of the taxation of certain descriptions church property'; of radical amend ments of the naturalization laws to pre vent frauds ; and of changes to more fully define the appropriate exercise of the rights ot expatriation, are timely and exceedingly well put. The whole people will thank the President for his enunciation or policy on the (Juban question. As a whole the message impresses us tar more favora bly than any of its predecessors during President Grant's incumbency of the Presidency. It shows mere care in conception and expression. It is also suggest! ireof possible modifications and revisions at the hands of its author's Cabinet counselors. If, as it is hinted tv iroisips in Washington. Senator Morton prepared that portion of the message relating to education and tx ation of church property, neither the Indiana Senator nor the President need be ashamed of the joint job. Hartford (Conn.) Courant. (Rep.) President Grant's seventh annual message will add to his reputation as a thoughtful and judicious chief execu tive. It is somewhat remarkable that the State papers ol a man of no legisla tive experience nor political training should exhibit so much of what may be propsrly called statesmanship. His treatment, for instance, of the Cuban question, the most important and deli cate questica before the country, as far as our foreign relations are concerned. nas been from the first dispassionate and in accordance with the soundest reason, despite the pressure which has been brought to bear in favor of an op posite course, and of the temptations which an aggressive policy would offer to an ambitious man of military tastes and training. No State paper has ever been presented to an American Cjn gressamore commendable in its tone and temper than that portion of the present message which refers to the relations of the United Slates with Spain. It leaves, however, the recent extensive naval preparations as much a puzzle as ever. - From the Philadelphia Bulletin, (Rep.) The message, throughout, is a business-like ami able document and pre sents to the country at large abundant food for wholesome thought, and to Congress the suggestion of very much important legislation. The people of the country, with thwir average good, patriotic, solid sense, will profit by the President's words. Whether Congress wmoegittea wiui equal wisdom re mains to be se-n. Tnere is nothing in the President's Message which con stitutes any different allusion to the "third term ' issue from what he has m ule on former occasions. A single expression, in which he speaks of thi' as his last annual message "before his successor is chosen" does not convey any intimation on the subject, as, in the event of either a third term or no third term, the writer of the next an nual message will be "the successor" of the present incumbent. The Presi dent evidently does not feel it necessa ry to discuss any such subject, before Congress or elsewhere. N. Y Herald, (Ind. Catholic.) The annual message sent to CongreM, touches upon a great variety, of im portant subjects, and on the greater part of them we are bound to say that it delivers sound, or, at least, defensi ble views. But there is one capital ex ception; one subject on which there commendations of the President are sheer folly. It nnfortnnately happens that the subject on which the f resident is utterly wrong is the one which he presses with the most, vigor and zeal He is sound on the Cuban question: sound, in the main, on the most im portant ol the financial .ques tions; sound and admirable on the question of cable monopolies; discreet and even wise on the M extern ques tion; plausible at least if not right,'on the naturalization question. But on the combined religious and school ques tion, upon whieh he lays hischief stress; and emphasis, he is wild. Quixotic ano utterly absurd. This attempt tointro-' duce religion as a controlling element' in our national politics, the zeal with which he flings this firebrand, and trie to kindle theological animosities for party effect, is the most mischievous and monstrous violation of fitness and propriety ever perpetrated by a Presi dent of the United States. Xew York Sun. This is the longest message Grant ver signed. It is not very interesting reading, and we don t believe the peo ple will pay much heed to any of its recommendations which may be re garded as having originated with its author. The school and church question is a congenial topic to bun, and afford: proof that his thorny subject win be in corporated into the next National Re publican p'atform. and play a part in the coming Presidential campaign. Themessage will disappoint public expectation on the Cuban question.' The President handles it elaborately, but leaves it exactly where he found it. Grant Is sound on the currency ques tion. He auvocates an early return to specie payments, and is in favor of ad hering to the present law nxing the in itial point of resumption on the first of January, 1879. He asks Congress for further legislation to give full effect to the existing law. We fancy Congress will do nothing of the kind, but after wrangling a long wnilo over it, will ioiu in a deadlock between the two louses, and thus prepare the way for making this phase of the financial prohlem a leading issue in the Presi dential campaign. The National Road. To Editor of the Chronicle. me through the of your paper, to call the attention of the public to the dilapidated condition of the National Road, and see if there can not be something done to save the road bed before it is entirely worn oJt. That grand old thoroughfare, the me morial wt the large hearted Henry Clay and that has doue so much for the wel fare aud prosperity of our county, and is still such a source of travt l and ac commodation to the community. It o-rtainly is the duty of Urn citizens of the county, to protest against letting the road bed be entirely destroyed. It is evident that under the .present man agement, the road is getting worse every year, and will soon be entirely worn out, uulesssoine means r.re adopt ed for its preservation. The question arises, what measures can be adopted for the better manage ment and maintenance of the road? When the National Hoad was ceded to the State by the United States, the Conditions were, tlfit the State should ever keep the same in good repair, and she is legaly and morally bound to do so. The legislature will shortly meet, ami our Representatives ought to W informed in regard to the bad condi tion of the road, and to be persistent in pressing for an appropriation to put the same in good repair, and urge the assembly to fulfill the obli aiionsof the State iu regard to it. And should the legislature object to maso an appropri ation, our Representatives, if possible," should get a bill passed to cede the road to the counties through which it p isses, and put the same under the control of the Commissioners of the said counties. II those of our citizens that ahave served in the legislature would give us their experience and views iu regard to the former legisla tion about the road, both bv the State and by the United States, at the time it was ceded, and what were the laws and conditions in regard to the trans fer, both it would th row B.
