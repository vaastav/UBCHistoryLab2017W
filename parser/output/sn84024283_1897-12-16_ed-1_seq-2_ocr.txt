Peace and good will with ii nations of the earth continue unbroken, he ys. and we should feel genuine satisfaction at e growing spirit of fraternal regard and uni fication in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party 3Qfejudioe The Finances. Beginning with the subject of the finances, ne president says that while the full effect of he legislation of the extra session has not yet een realized, what it has already accomplished -assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To '. es its permanent value further time will be i required and the Deoole. satisfied with Ita oner- : -stions and results thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. The next ques tion pressing for consideration Is that of the -currency. With the great resources of govern ment and wits the honorable example of the past before us. we ought not to hesi to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obliga- - (ions less onerous to the government, and re lieve our financial laws from ambiguity and ioubt.

It is manifest that we must devise ome plan to protect the government against pood issues for repeated redemptions. We Slave 

VUO.OUO.OOO of currency, which the gov eroment, by solemn enactment, has undertaken So keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem la gold but the government, which must borrow the gold. The law, which requires the payment out of the treasury of redeemed United States notes, demands a constant replenishment of the - yol reserve, especially in times of panic and o sufficient revenue, and during the preceding -administration t3S2,315,400 4H-per-cenU bonds ere issued and sold to sustain the gokl reserve and pay the expenses - of the government in excess of revenue. While at is true that a greater part of this is used to uupply deficient revenues, a considerable por tion was required to maintain the gold reserve. It no further legislation is to be had. to correct ' this and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the sec retary of the treasury authority to sell bonds xk long or short periods, bearing a less rate of Saterest than is now authorized by law. The president says: Bccom mendat Ions. I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts t the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any United States notes are presented for redemp tion In gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid mt in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government ue should not receive back from the govern went a United States note without paying gold to exchange for it," That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv ing an interest bearing debt, a government bond, for a non-interest bearing debt, a United SStates note. The government should be re lieved from the burden of providing all the .Stold required for exchanges and exports. This ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity mod sufficient reoeipts we may feel no immediate -embarrassment, but the danger will be ever present The president invites careful consideration -for the detail plan of the secretary of the treas jltj to protect the gold reserve. He concurs with him in the recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of their bonds deposited: that their cir culation tax be reduced to one-half of one per cent., and national banks may be established with a capital of fcJo.Ouu, He also recommends XJhat the issue of national bank notes be re stricted to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards and that they be required to redeem seir notes in gold. The Cuban Question. Turning to foreign affairs, the president de votes much space in his message to a consider ation of the Cuiian question, which he says, is the most important problem with which our ccorernment how called upon to deal in its foreign relations. Summarizing the history of former outbreaks, the president comes down to the present insurrection, speaking of its re markable increase, its tenacious existence iswainst enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property and the disiegard or the civilized code of war on both sides. He says these conditions .rive rise to gravest a pprehenslons. There is bo desire on our part to profit by Spain's mis fortunes, and we have only the desire to see Oibans enjoying that measure of self-control, which is the inalienable right of man. Of the concentration policy of Weyler he says: "It feas utterly failed as a war measure. It is not .civilized warfare it is extermination." Oar Government's Protest. Against this abuse of the rights of war, the 'president says, he has felt constrained, on re seated occasions, to enter the firm and honest .protest of this government. He outlines his instructions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon the Spanish gov- eminent the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by . reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and . Honorable to Spain and to the Cuban people it was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make proposals for settle- asot and it was said that we could not contem- giate an indefinite period lor tne accompnsu : sacat of this result. The Spanish Reply. The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford, was, in the Etre&ident's opinion, in the direction of a tastier understanding. It admitted our friendly - purposes and deep interest, and declared that ' the new government was bound to change of - policy that should satisfy the United States and ' uncif v Cubs within a reasonable time. To this : tui nolitical reforms will be put into effect and military operations conducted on humane iini It was suggested that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and sT-ant political reforms wmie tne United States for its part should enforce neu tral obligations and cut off the assistance which the insurgents, it was asserted, received from this country. Early and complete pacifi--xtinn in honed for. The president declares that the Spanish dis position to charge us with failure to meet in Eernational duties is baseless, and points to -! offnrts this government have made at the cost of millions, and by the employment of the administrative machinery of the nation to per form its duty well. He also says that the fact Chat no military expedition or armed vessel a..., irt. mir shores has been diplomatically MnKtu-ntni with Spain. Promising that throughout all-the horror and danger to our ... iTnited States has never abrogated its rig'ht to determine its policy as to Cuba, the nresident points out that, of untried measures, there remains only: Recognition of the insur gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end - h imnnsiiur a rational compromise be tween the contestants, an intervention in favor -X one or the otner pany.

The president next takes up the subject of the annexation of Hawaii which, he says, should be accomplished. Rapidly reviewing his former arguments in favor of annexation, he says that legislation is required in the event of the ratifi cation of the treaty and. while abrupt assimila tions of immature elements of population should be avoided, just provision should be made for self-rule in local matters with the largest po litical liberty to the Hawaiians. He says that the dispute between Japan and Hawaii over the immigration question is now in a satisfactory stage of settlement by negotia tions; that our government has not intervened, and that it is learned that Japan Ls now con fident in the intention of this government to deal with all possible ulterior questions affect ing her interests in the broadest spirit of friendliness. Central American Complexities. Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Mer ry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on account of the obligations of that countrv to the diet of the Greater Republic of Central America. As there is no legal authority at present to accredit him to the diet, Mr. Baker, the present minister at Managua, has been di rected to present his letters of recall. Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter is said to be likewise accred ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Re public, and his case is awaiting action. The Nicaragua Canal. The Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of large importance to our country, and the promise is made of further reference to the subject which, in the report of the commission now at work, is senfc-to congress. International Bi-91etallism. The president says of the international mon etary commission that, notwithstanding dil igent effort, the envovs have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratifica tion is expressed at the action of France in this matter in joining in our effects, and it is said that the negotiations are still pending. Meanwhile the envoys have not made their final reports, believing that the doubts raUed in certain quarters respecting the feasibility of maintaining parity between gold and silver may yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes tnat ineir taoors may onng atout an interna tional agreement. .Reciprocity Negotiations. Mr. Kasson, of Iowa, is said to be now con ducting negotiations with several governments lor reciprocity arrangements under the tarul act, and it is believed that bv a careful exercise of the powers conferred by the act. some griev ances of our own and other countries in our mutual trade relations may be removed or alle viated and tne volume of our commercial ex changes enlarged. The president earnestly urges the improve ment of our merchant marine, the inferiority of which, he says, is humiliating to the national pride. f rotection or Mai L.ire. Reference is made to the recent conferences at Washington on the subject of the protection of seal life, the results of which place beyond controversy, it is said, of the duty of the gov ernments concerned to adopt measures without delay for the preservation of the herds. Nego tiations to tnis ena are now in progress. International Arbitration. International arbitration is declared br the president to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world, and treaties embodying thess humane principles on broad lines, without in any way imperilling our interests cr honor, will have its constant encouragement. The Parts Exposition. A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order that the United States may make a creditable exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, in wmcn the people nave snown an unprecedented interest. The Navy. Under the head of the na7. the president points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure tne armor for the three battleships now building, which would be otherwise use less. He speaks in terms of praise of the qual ity of our ships, and thinks that the time has now arrived when the increase to wnich the country is committed should for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels Lack of Dock Facilities. He refers to the lack of docks, and urges that three or four of the largest docks be provided on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific coast, and a floating dock in the gulf. There should also be ample provision for munitions of war and an increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards, and as there are now on the stocks five large battleships it is recommended that an appropriation be made but for one more battle ship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo ooats are also necessary. Legislation Needed for Alaska. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for surveys and for the establishment of another land office at some point in the Yukon valley, for which an appropriation is asked. Military force is also necessary and the estab lishment of some sort of flexible government. If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the miners b fully veri fied, every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. Affairs In the Indian Territory. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Indian territory. The large white element is said to be without protection and without schools or oth er rights of citizens; leading Indians have ab sorbed great tracts of lands and created an aristocracy, and the friends of the Indians be lieve that the best interests of the five civilized tribes would be found in American citizenship. Failure of the Dawes CoinnilnBiun, Reference is made to the failure so far of tho Dawes commission to secure the consent of the tribes to an extinguishment of the tribal titles and a division of the lands. It is said that should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree ment, that some legislation should be had by congress. The Qaarautiue Lawn. The president approves the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury for an exten sion of the quarantine laws, and also suggests the appointment of a special commission to as certain the cau.e of yellow fever. The Kansas Paciflo Railroad. Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas Pacific railroad, it is said, that if no better bidder ls received than the upset price fixed by the court, the government would receive only t2.500.(XW on its claim c nearly 13.0 O.UoU. He believes that the government ha the authority to bid on the road, and has directed the secre tary of the treasury to make the deposit of fyou.Ooo required to qualify as a bidder, and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the prin cipal of the debt to the government. Cougrru Should Legislate in the Case. He suggests, however, that in a matter so im portant as the government becoming a possible wner of the railroad, congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him, however, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one half the principal of its debt and less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. The Civil Service. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to the civil service, the practical its' provement of which, he savs, has long been subject of irnest discussion, and which has of laie years, receiteu uicnsaseu legislative uuu ex ecutive approval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded againt: tne examinations improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by living a hearing before dis missal upon all cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done with out impairing tne power of re moval, one of the vital safeguards of tne system. Aiucn remains to he done be fore the system can be perfected, and the pres ident says mat ne snau not nesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly lnciuaea in tne ciass;neu service, or include those which, in his judgment, will best promote the public service The system has the ap proval of the people, and it will be his endeavor to uphold ana extenu iu Retrenchment Suggested, In conclusion, the president admonishes con gress not to encourage the Increase of the esti mates for the maintenance of the government. They would admit of decrease in many brancbes and it is a commanding duty to keep the appro priations within the receipts of the govern ment! and thus avoid a aencit. An Episode.

BEGINNING AT HOilE. a. Bin to Prohibit Pelagio Sealing by Americans. Take the Beam from Thine Own Eye" The Scriptural Kale to be Observed That We May be More Consistent In Prohibit ing Others Anomalous Position. Washington, Dec 9. The senate committee on foreign relations author ized a favorable report upon a bill pro- ibiting pelagic sealing by the people of the United States. The bill is a joint production of the state and treasury departments, and its passage is asked upon the ground that with such a law upon the statue books of this country the administration will be in better position than at present to ask that other governments prohibit pelagic sealing. The bill received the affirmative votes of all the senators present, but its provisions were dis cussed at considerable length. The bill was reported to the senate later in the day. The first section of it is as follows: - That no citizen of the United States, nor person owing duly or obedience to the laws or treaties of the United States, nor any person belonging to or on board of a vessel of the United States, shall kill, capture or hunt, at any time or in any manner whatever, any fur seal in the waters of the Pa cific ocean north of the thirty-fifth de gree of north latitude, and including Behring sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. The bill also prohibits any citizen of the United States from equipping, us- ng or employing or furnishing sup plies to any vessel engaged in killing or hunting fur seals, and declares that no United States vessel shall be em ployed in this work. The penalty for violating the pro posed law is imprisonment for not more than six months or a fine of not less than 200 nor more than S2.000 or both and the forfeiture of vessels so engaged. The fourth section of the bill is as follows: 'If any vessel of the United States shall be found within the waters to which this act applies,having on board fur sealskins or bodies of seals or ap paratus or implements suitable for killing or taking seals, it shall be pre sumed that such vessel was used or em ployed in the killing of said seals or that said apparatus or implements were used in violation of this act until the contrary is proved to the satisfac tion of the court." The United States courts in Alaska, California, Oregon and Washington are given jurisdiction over cases arising under this act. It is especially provided that the act is not to interfere with the privileges of coast Indians nor with the taking of seals on the Pribvlolf islands. Officers of the navy and the revenue cutter service are empowered to search suspected vessels. The importation of sealskins by any person taken contrary to this law is 'prohibited, and all such skins so imported are to be seized and destroyed. Representative Ilitt, of Illinois, chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the house, introduced a simi lar bill in the house. This measure supplements the diplo matic negotiations which have been going on for some time between the United States, Great Britain, Russia and Japan. Throughout the negotia tions the representatives of Great Britain contended that an effort was being made to have British citizens stop pelagic sealing while at the same time the Lmted States permitted its own citizens to carry on this destruction. When the American commissioners urged that pelagic sealing was contrary to the dictates of humanity, they were in variably met with the answer that this inhumanity was sanctioned by the laws of the United States. The state department desires to overcome this objection. The law as it stands permits citizens of the United States to take seals out side of the three-mile limit surround ing the PribylofE islands. This was never intended, but uas come aoout through a supreme court decision re specting the Paris award. The law reads that citizens of the United States shall not take seals "in the waters of Alaska." It was supposed that this was a uni versal prohibition to our citizens. But the Paris court of arbitration held that the United States had no property in the seals outside of the three-mile limit of the Pribyloffi islands. In con struing this, the supreme court held that as the Lmted States bad no property outside of the three-mile limit the law prohibiting the destruc tion of seals "in the waters of Alaska" did not apply to pelagic sealing on the high seas. In consequence poaching by American vessels was m effect legal ized and quite a number of American vessels have been sealing in Behring sea, although the government has been seeking to show that this sealing was unjustifiable. It is expected also that tnis step by the United States will have a salutary effect on the negotiations now in prog1- ress with Great Britain and Canada. Mr. Hitt will call the bill up at the meeting of the committee on foreign affairs to-day, and the purpose is to have it reported and passed with the 'east delay possible. A 

MUCH-WANTED FORGER. Brought from England to Stand Trial In Cincinnati. New York, Dec 9. Charles Fisher, alias J. B. Ford, reached this city yes terday on board the steamer Teutonic from England. Fisher is in custody of a detective from Cincinnati, to which place he is being taken to answer to the charge of forgery, by which he is alleged to have obtained a considera ble sum of money from the Cincinnati Coffin Co. lie is also accuse! of hav ing been one of a gang of letter-bos robbers. AD:p.:W-Dcorro, market. It Leads to a Determination to Reduce Vfaces of Operatives. Fall River, Mass., Dec 9. Fall River cotton manufacturers at a special meeting' yesterday voted to reduce the wages of operatives. The cut will not be less than ten. per cent, and will af fect about 25,000 employes. The cause of the reduction is the depressed, con dition of the cotton market which does not enable print cloth, it is asserted, to be manufactured for the price now prevailing, which is the lowest on rec ord. HOivic rtULc FuK OU3Ai ftm Corner-stone of the Programme for the Antilles Spanish Sovereignty is An other Reciprocity With the United Statea the Third Item in the Programme If Honestly Undertaken Prosperity Might be Restored. New York, Dec lO.-Home rule for Cuba; for Spain, soverignty; for the United States, reciprocity. The pro gramme is defined. If carried out it might insure years of tranquillity and prosperity to the Antilles, says the cor respondent of the Tribune in Havana. Until the first point is settled the last one is necessarily inchoate. It does form part of the public discussion of autonomy. Only the few thought ful men who are looking beyond the politics of to-day make it a cardinal feature in the Cuban policy of the future. Except for the fall in sugar, it is contended by thoughtful men that the abuses of Spanish colonial misgovernment in the island would have been endured uutil corrected. In prosperity the weight of corrupt and oppressive adtninistration did not seem to bear so heavily. In adversity it became unbearable. With concessions from Spain which promises to give Cuba its own government, the economic conditions again become prominent, and commercial relations with the United States are the basis of all the plans for improvement. A wide gulf must be bridged with autonomy before force can be given to these ideas. The gulf may never be spanned, because support at either end by Spanish partisans and Cuban revo lutionists is wanting; yet the sugges tion of reciprocity is significant of the future relations of the island to the United States. The Cubans who de clare the revolution must go on until independence is won have theories of their own. One of these is that broader and more stable reci procity will be secured to the United States if it treats with the Cuban re public instead of with a colony of Spain. That is their answer. It should not be understood that the representatives of the Spanish cabinet in Cuba are concerning themselves with ttiese matters of economy. It is the men of theories who are doing that. CapL-Gen. Blanco has too much im mediate work to look so far ahead. To ndo what Weyler had done in malad ministration is a huge task in itself. Soinethiug of this labor has been ac complished in administrative offices, but this has little bearing on the main question. The places are filled by men who are in sympathy with the gov ernment, and who will loyally help to carry out its plans. These are details. More important is the rapproachment of tlie ooiitical parties. The Madrid correspondents of the Havana journals describe the Sagasta ministry as in the enjoy menC'of its honeymoon. UNREST AMONG MOSLEMS. Susglit in Asia In the Throes of a ReU. giuus Insurrection. St. Petersburg, Dec. 10. Through out Russia in Asia there is general un rest among the Moslems. It is attrib uted to the exaggerated reports of the Turlush victory over the "great Greek empire"' which have spread through the length and breadth of the conti nent. The authorities even fear that the revival of brigandage recently no ticed in the Caucasus is directed almost solely against the government offi cials, and the unprecedented phenome non of Georgians displaying hostility toward Armenians has become mani fest. The danger is so serious that a. con ference of Caucasian governors has been convoked to concert measures of pacification. Travelers in Central Asia report an extraordinary ferment among the Mos lems of different races. They are sink ing their mutual animosities and de claring that they are first of all Mo- hamedans with the sultan as their common chief. It is evident that the slightest pre text would suffice to bring about an uprising and to plunge Russia inti the same sea of trouble as India. KNOW HOW IT IS THEM SELVES A French Paper Intimates that the United J States is Afraid of Germany. Paris, Dec 10. The Temps com menting upon the settlement of the Ilavti-German trouble, says: "President Sam, and his colleague: imagined that the convenient aud elas tic Monroe doctrine would apply tc their case. This little calculation was wrong. The United States was not anxious to advertise or extend theii solidarity of negro states. On the other hand, the last reproach that can be urfired airainst the policy of Wash ington is not taking into account the relative strength of nations. America does not wish to embroil itself with Germany, merely for the beaux yeux Of the black republic. 

CAPTURED A SEAPORT. The Cubans Occupy the Seaport of Cai ma nors, Near Gnanatauamo. Havana, Dec. lO.-It is officially an aounced from Spanish headquarters that a "group of rebels" has entered Caimanera, near Guanatanamo, "fa Tored by the treason of an officer." Caimanera is the port of Guanatana mo, and is situated 15 miles by rail from the latter place. Caimanera is on the bay of Guanatanamo, otherwise Cumberland harbor. OSBORN M'M. StAVANAGH. Death of the Third Secretary of the Brit ish Embassy. Washixgtox, Dec 10. Mr. Osborn McM. Kavanagh, third secretary of the British embassy, died typhoid fever, Mr. Kavanagh arrived in Washington last Jauuary, having been transferred to Washington from Stockholm. He was the son of a former well-known member of the British parliament.

A Mother and Four Children Foully Murdered During the Absence of the Father Ai-ens era on the Trail or the Murderer, As sisted by Trained Bloodhounds Lynching Will follow Capture. Wessox, Miss., Dec. 10. One of the most atrocious murders on record in the south was committed Wednesday night in Simpson county, this state, 20 miles from here. Brown Smith, a farmer and a son of ex-Representative Edward Smith, left bis family at his home in the country to go to town for shopping purposes, thinking of no possible danger for them. Yesterday morning when he returned he found his wife and fire children weltering in their blood and apparently all dead. An alarm was raised immediately and the entire neighborhood turned out to hunt for the perpetrator of the foul and bloody crime. There being no telegraphic connec tions details of the murder came in slowly, but it is reported this evening that one of the little girls, supposed this morning to have been dead, has revived enough to tell what she knew of the occurrences. She said that she knows the man who committed the deed; that it was a negro and described him. A posse is now on the track of the murderer, and there is great probabil ity that he will be apprehended, and there can be but little doubt of him meeting speedy justice when caught, without waiting for the formality of a court. It is learned that Mrs. Smith and the other four children are dead. Sheriffs McNair of Lincoln and Thomp son of Copiah counties have gone to the scene of the murder, each with 8 pack of trained bloodhounds. UNREQUITED LOVE. An Italian's Strange Manifestation of Re venged. Philadelphia, Dec 10. Antonio Tucci, an Italian, yesterday shot and probably fatally wounded G. Tompono, because of the rejection of his affec tions by Tompono's 19-year-old daughter Theresa. He followed this up by setting fire to the clothing of Tompono's little son, Michael, and when an attempt was made to arrest him he successfully held a squad of po licemen and firemen at bay until he had twice fired his revolver at them and slightly wounded Policeman Simpson and a citizen named Sacchar rino. Finally, driven into a corner, he set fire to his room and, until se curely handcuffed, defended himself with a large knife. Tucci is about 45 years old. He lived with Tompono and for a long time has shown affection for Theresa. ' Wednes day he pleaded for her love and was re jected. Yesterday afternoon Tcmpono was working in the yard when Tucci opined fire upon him. Tompono is in a very critical condition, but his son was only slightly burned. TALKED TOO PLAINLY. A. Traveling Evangelist Threatened byan Angry Mob. Flobesce, Kas., Dec. 11. Traveling Evangelist E. L. Martin was,onThurs day.given hours to leave town, and for a time it looked as though he would be tarred and feathered. At a pre vious meeting the preacher had slan dered many of the town officials, prom inent men, and had attacked the school children. An indignation meeting, called dur ing the day, rebuked his utterances and requested him to leave town. Martin became defiant and held his usual revival meeting in the evening. A crowd of men gathered outside to await his exit, but Martin defeated them by holding an all-night prayer meeting, 20 or 30 of his adherents re maining with him. He still held the fort yesterday, but may be roughly treated. Later. Evangelist Martin attempted to hold another meeting last night, but the demonstration of the townspeople be came so threatening that the preacher discreetly withdrew. A crowd of about 100 citizens escorted him to the railway station and kept back those who would have harmed him. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BAY. Spain's Million-Dollar Floating Dock Sunk in Havana Harbor. Ha v asa, Dec lO.-Tbe famous float- .ng dock, built in England at great ex pense, and brought here really for use in the event of a war with the United States, floats no longer. Monday it hecran to disappear gradually and slowly, and is now beneath the wa ters of the bay. Its disappearance has caused much confusion in the naval department, and amusement elsewhere.
