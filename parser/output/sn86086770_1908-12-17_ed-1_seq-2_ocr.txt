TRIBUNE, MINERAL POINT, WISCONSIN- Washington Whisperings Interesting Bits of News Gathered at the National Capital. Amazing Increase in Divorce Is Shown WASHINGTON.— It was generally known that divorces hi the United States were getting more numerous each year, but nobody was prepared for the sutprising statement made in a census bureau report that one marriage out of every twelve in the country terminates in divorce. Yet, such is the case, as shown by the bureau’s figures. The statistics are the result of care ful gathering of figures In every slate in the union, the period covered being from 1887 to 1906. The last set of national statistics on marriage and divorce covered the period from 1867 to 1886. The present set of statistics, taken in conjunction with the former one, therefore, gives a view of the marriage and divorce question for the past 40 years. The total number of marriages re corded for the 20-year period from 1887 to 1906 was 12,832,044. The total number of divorces for the period was 945,625. For the period of the first investiga tion of the subject, from 1867 (o 1886, the total number of divorces was 328,- 716. At the beginning of the 40-year period covered by both investigations there were in this country 10,000 di vorces annually; at the end of the period there were 66,000 annually. The divorce rate per 100,000 popula tion Increased from 29 in 1897 to 82 in 1905. The rate per 100,000 married Ethel Roosevelt Mourns Loss of Lemon cof oF> r3tio*tc guy t M THE strenuous life is not for Lemon, a small bull pup, v.-hose habitat? until recently, was the White House. Lemon noticed a door ajar the other morning w'hlle roaming the White House, looking for excitement, and has not returned. Though his name might not indicate it, Lemon is a puppy of class and caste. But for all that he’s a dog and (he sight of his vagabond brothers romping in the streets, dodging auto mobiles and snapping at horses’ heels disgusted the Is'inon with being the first dog in the land and he beat it. Lemon is the property of Miss Ethel Roosevelt, debutante elect, who report ed her loss to the police instanter a Naval Officers Experts in Diplomacy ! ' f 

WHKN It comes to diplomatic maneuvering to accomplish their designs the officers of the navy can give pointers to the Russians and the Japanese. Vs *•-, instance the case of the hospital ship Relief inny be cited, it will be remembered that last win ter President Roosevelt made an or der that the Relief should be com manded by a medical officer. The men at the navy department were amazed that u doctor should be gn >n com mand of a vessel, but there was no appeal from Mr. Roosevelt’s order. The Relief was detailed to accompany the fleet on Its trip around the world. Letters from men who are with the fleet have been received here telling of the sad experiences of the hospital ship and her commander. In describ ing these experiences one writer pref aced his letter as follows; "The Re lief Is the most unpopular Institution In the navy. There Is no exception. The Relief has everything else beaten." Weather Kiosk to Be Placed on Street !- i v,EATHf trip I ■ * AN Interesting experiment Is about to be conducted in Washington. If It meets with success It will be ex tended to other cities. In the course of a few days there win be opened at one of the busiest points on Pennsyl vania avenue a weather kiosk similar to those now In use in Berlin and other places in Germany. The object of the agricultural department In bringing about this innovation is to supply meteorological information in popular form Behind the curtained windows of the kiosk will he copies of 1 population was 81 in H7O and 200 in 1890. “This comparison,” says the bulletin, indicates that divorce is at present two and one-half times as common, compared with married population, as It was 40 years ago.’ The Dakotas, which have a national reputation as divorce states, prove, on analysis of the tables, to be nowhere, either In total number of divorces granted or number of divorces per 100.000 of population, as against other states, In discussing the relation of divorce to population, the bulletin seys: "An increase of 30 per cent, in population between the years 1870 to 1880 was accompanied by an increase of 79 per cent, in the number of divorces granted In (he next decade, 1880 to 1890, the population increased 25 per cent, and divorces 70 per cent., and In the fol lowing decade, 1890 to 1900, an in crease of 21 per cent. In population was accompanied by an increase of 66 per cent, in the number of divorces, in ihe six years from 1900 to 1906, papulation, as estimated, Increased 10.5 per cent, and divorces 29.3 tier cent. "It thus appears that at the end of the 40-year period divorces were in creasing about three times as fast as population, while in the first decade (1870 to 1880) they Increased only about two and two-thirds ns fast. “Divorce rates appear to be much higher in the United States than In any of the foreign countries for winch statistics relaf* it to this subject have been obtained. Two-thirds of the total number of divorces granted in the 20-year period covered by this Investigation were granted to the wife. Children were re ported in 39.8 per cent, of the total number of divorce cases. general lookout order was sent to every district In the precinct, and by nightfall there was not a dog on the streets of Washington. In the collec tion h. id for Identification was every suedes of canine from a mangy mastiff to a fiea-hltten fire. Hut none answered to the name of Lemon. Various motives. If a dog may have Ia motive, may be assigned to Lemon's abrupt departure from the Roosevelt household. He might have had a vision of a small bull pup swinging to Ihe port side of a lion In the wilds of Africa, and his master’s voice shout ing ’sic ’em Lemon.” Again, he might have dreaded the time when he would reach the proper age to be harnessed to one of Master Archie's carts, or be matched In a main with the household eat, or wear an empty ran attc-bed to his tail. However, Lemon’s motive for running away is purely speculative, for it is not given in the police report, and his mistress “ran attribute no cause for the rash act.” The story is that the Relief has been burdened with woe ever since the cruise began, and that every officer of the navy, except the doctors, is tickled to death that this Is so. The line officers who didn't approve having a doctor as their commander have found many ways, the story goes, of making life miserable to the men in charge of the hospital ship. Of course the suggestion of a service conspiracy to this end would be resented and could not be proven, but there Is a sub rosa intimation that something very like a cabal has been formed with (he purpose of proving how much a doctor doesn't know about running a ship. Wherever the fleet has been the Re lief has usually limped along behind the procession. She has had trouble getting supplies, getting coal, getting consideration of all kinds. It always Just happened this way and nobody in particular was to blame. It is hinted that when the fleet returns sug gestions will be made In many quar ters that the cruise has demonstrated that nobody Is competent to manage a war vessel who is not an accredited officer of the navy. In other words, that the experience of the Relief, with a medical officer tn command, has been a hopeless failure. the daily weather charts, forecasts is -tied by the weather bureau, maxi mum thermometer and therouograph for recording temperature and rain gauge. There will be no barometer for it Is the wish of the department that only meteorological facts in their simplest form shall be shown. Officials of the weather bureau be lieve there will be great public inter est in their new scheme. If their hopes are realised similar kiosks will be erected In about 15 cities in the course of the next five or six months. Among other things expected of these kiosks is that they will ruin the reputations held by many cities of the United States, especially Washington, (or excessive summer heat, many rec ords of this kind having been estab lished by inaccurate thermometers be ing hung outside stores and other buildings not conducive to correct readings.
