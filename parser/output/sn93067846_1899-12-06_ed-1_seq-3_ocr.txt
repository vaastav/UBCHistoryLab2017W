CONGRESS CONVENES. Republicans Elect Speaker Political Gossip of Interest to Politicians. Washington, Dec 4, 1899 -Hon J. D. Richardson, of Tennessee, wno ? received the democratic nomination for speaker, after one of the longest caneases ever held, got the vote of every democratic member of the , House tc day He was not, of] course, elected ; the republicans having the most votes, elected Representative Henderson Speaker, and adopted the old Reed rules,but Mr Richardson wiii be the democratic floor-leader of the house during the life of the Fifty sixth congress There m&y be more showy and brilliant men on the democratic side of the House, bat that he wiil make a shrewd and safe leader is conceded by all. His shrewdness would have been shown by the manner in which he conducted his campaign for the nomination of Speaker, bad it not been well established long ago He received no warmer congratulations cn his success than those extended by his three rivals for the honor LeaviDg Roberts and his polygamy entirely oat of the question, the position taken by the democrats in the first scrap of the session, which occurred when objection was raised to the swearing in of Roberts, that the boase had no right to go behind the official returns and deny a man a seat, when he presents proper cre? dentials, was right, but right can't win when a majority is determined to do the other thing. If Roberts can not clear himself of the charge of having violated the law. there will be few, if any, objections on the democratic side to his being denied a seat, but it is wrong to declare him I guilty before his case is fairly invest igated. < Mr McKinley's long message one cf the longest ever sent to con gress-was not sent in today, owing to the early adjournment of both s?cate and bouse as a mark of respect to the iate Vice President Hobart. It will go in tomorrow, and then the real business of the session of congress will begin The demo crats were never in a more aggress ive mood, and "hot times'' are ahead for the republican majority in both senate and house. The attention of senators is being called to the fact that Gov Stone bad no constitutional right to appoint Mr Quay to the senate, after the legisla? ture adjourned, without electing hie successor The State constitution of Pennsylvania expressly provides that vacancies in the United States sen ate sbaii only be filled by the legisla ture. A number of influential Penn sylvanians are in Washington work? ing against the seating of Quay on personal grounds, against both precedent and law One of these is ex-Represeniative Sowden, who said cn the subject : "The question should not be made a partisan one, but each senator, legardiees of his politics or &is personal ftiendship for Mr Quay, should vote as a conscien tioos, impartial and upright judge, and decide it according to its merits and the dictates of his own con science, under his official oath, if this be done, there can be no ques ?ion of the result Gov Stoned unlawful appointment has not a siDgle merit to support it " That our pension laws are in need of revision, everybody knows, but when they will get it, or whether the revision will majke them better or woree, is a horse of another color The secretary and assistant secretary of the interior, and the commissioner and assistant commissioner of pen 8?OD8, have testified before a sub committee, of the senate committee on pensions, that a revision of the laws should be made, and recom? mended that it be done by a non partisan commission A ?national commission that is reaiiy non partisan would be a rarity, indeed, although ? there are many so called Representative Smith of Kentucky, who was recently acting chairman of the Kentucky democratic State com mittee. thinks the legal contest in that State, depends upon the view j the court of appeals takes of tissue ballots He thinks those ballots were illegal, and knows that they were used extensively in the r^pub Hean border counties, to make sure that the ' floaters'* voted aa they were paid to vote He says if the j tissue ballots are tbrown out as illegal, Goebel wili have a plurality of from 2,000 to 10,000. Mr Smith says he doesn't believe there wili be any trouble in the State, no matter what the final decision m*y be Mr McKinley is in a somewhat j disagreeable predicament by reason of his desire to push his friend and I old family physician, Gen Leonard Wood, ahead in the regular army J He told Gen Wood* porno months \ ago. that he intended making him a brigadier general in the regular army, and it leaked ont There was a flood of protests from the friends of the line officers-many o? them influ? ential republicans-who objected t<> having them jumped by a s?a?f sur geon, with the rank of captain Mr McKinley then tried to satisfy Gen j Wood with something el>e, but he j wouldn't have it that way, preferring to stand pat on the original promise j PresidentConimunicatesWith Congress on Subjects of National Interest.

WASHINGTON, Bec. ?.-The president today transmitted to congress his an? nual message, as follows: To the SenaLe and House of Represen? tatives: At the threshold of your deliberations you are cailed to mourn with your coun? trymen the death of Vice President Ho? bart, who passed from tins life on the morning of November 21st, last. His great soul now rests in eternal peace. His private iife was pure and elevated, while his public career was ever distin? guished by large capacity, stainless in? tegrity and exalted motives. He has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified, but his lotty character, his devotion to duty, his hon? esty of purpose and nobie virtues re? main with us as a priceless legacy and example. The* Fifty-sixth congress convenes in its first regular session with the country in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will among the people at home and in relations of peace and friendship with every government of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown groat increase in volume and value. The combined imports and ex? ports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single yoar in all our his? tory. Our exDorts for lS9s) alone ex? ceeded by more than ?1,000,000.000 our imports and exports combined in 1S70. The imports per capita are 1:0 per cent less than in 1670, while the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in iS70, showing the enlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its own increasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. Question of Trusts. Combinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle com? petition, iimit production and determine the prices of products used and con? sumed by the people, are justly provok? ing public discussion and should early claim the attention or the c ongress. The industrial commission created by the act of congress of June IS, lS'JS, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questions involved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their investigations of this subject and the conclusion and recommendations at which they may arrive are undetermined. The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and variety or cause and exten t of the injuries to the public which may result fruin large combinations concentrating more or less numerous enterprises and estalish ments which previously to the forma? tion of the combination were carried separately. It is universally conceded that combi? nations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of mer? chandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by suppressing nat? ural and ordinary competition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the gen? eral consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common lav.% but also to the pub? lic welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organiza? tions. Ii the present law can be ex? tended more certainly to control cr check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. What? ever power the congress posesses over this most important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted. It is apparent that uniformity of leg? islation upon this subject in the several states is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uniformity founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may be obtained and that means may be found for the congress within the limitations of its constitutional power so as to supplement an effective code of state legislation so to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general ob? servance of the salutary rules to which I have referred. The whole question is so important and farreaching ihat I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it will have the studied deliberation of congress resulting in wise and judicious action. Til?* Nicaragua Canal. The Nicaragua canal commission, which had been engaged upon the work of examination and survey for a route across Nicaragua, having completed its labors and made its reports, was dis? solved on May 31, aud on June 10 a new j commission, known as the isthmian ? canal commission, was organized under the terms o:' the act approved March Z, lbi)9. for the purpose of examining the ! American isthmus with a view to de- ! terminiui: the most practicable and j feasible route for a ship canal across that isthmus, with its probable cost and other essential details. This commission, under the presi? dency of Rear Admiral John G. Wal ker, U. 3. N.. retired, entered promptly j ?ipon the work intrusted tb it and is j nov/ carrying on examinations in Nica- j ragua along the route of the Panama canal and in Darien from the Atlantic, j from the neighborhood of the A trait o ; river to the bay of Panama ou the Pa- i cific side. Good progress has been * made, but under the law a comnrehen- i sive and complete investigation is called for; which will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplish- j ment. The work will be prosecuted as expeditiously as possible and a report made at the earliest practicable date. The great importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly i pressed upon the attention of the con- j gress. In my message ot' a year ago I j expressed niv views of the necessity ot j a canal which would link tiie two great i oceans, to which i again invite your con- ! sideration. The reasons then presented for eany action are i vea stronger now. HOT-lin tish < oril <.;. This government has maintained an ! attitude ot neutrality in the unfortu? nate contest between Great Britain ;?ni the Boer states of A' rica. We nave re? mained faithful to the precept of avoid? ing entangling alliances as to affairs j not of our direct concern. Had cronin- ; stances suggested that the parties to the j quarrel would have welcomed any ? kindly expression of the hope of American people tba: war mi?rht averred, good ornees would have bi gla?ly tendered. The United -?rates' representative Pretoria was ear^y instructed to seer, ail neutral American interests be sneered by the combatants. This 3 been an easy task iu view of the pr rive declarations of both British a Boer authorities thar, tho personal a property rights or our citizens shot be observed. Upon the withdrawal of the Brit agent from Pretoria, the United Sta consni was authorized, upon the requ or the British governmont and with t assent of the Sont ii African and Oran Free State governments, to exercise t customary good offices of a neutral : the care of British interests. In the ci charge of this function, I am happy say that abundant opportunity has be afforded to show the impartiality of ti government toward both the comb ants. Cuban Administration. My annual message of last year vi necessarily devoted in great parc rt consideration of the Spanish war a of the results it wrought and the com tions it imposed for the future. I z gratified to announce that the treaty peace has restored friendiv relations 1 tween the two powers. Effect has be given to its important provisions. T evacuation of Porto Rico having airea* been accomplished on Oct. 18, ISi nothing remained necessary there continue the provisional military cc trol of the island until the co gress should enact a suitable gover ment for the ceded territory. Of t character and scope of the measures that end I shall treat in another parc this message. The withdrawal of the authority Spain from the island of Cuba was e fected by Jan. 1, so thac the full re-e tablishment of peace found the reli quished territory held by us in trust f the inhabitants, maintaining under tl direction of the executive such gover menc and control therein as should co serve public order, restore the produ tive conditions of peace so long di curbed by the instability and disord which prevailed for the greater part the preceding three decades, and bui np that tranquil development of the d mestic state whereby alone can be rea ized the high purpose as proclaimed i the joint resolution adopted by the co: gress on Aprii 19, l$9d, by which tl United States disclaimed any dispos tion or intention to exercise sovereignt; jurisdiction or control over Cuba, e: cept for the pacification thereof, and a serted its derermination when that W? accomplished to leave the governmei and control of the island to its people. The pledge contained in this resolt tion is of the highest honorable oblig: tion and must be sacredly kept. I b lieve that substantial progress has bee made in this direction. All the admii istrative measures adopted in Cuba ha\ aimed to fit for a regenerated existenc by enforcing the supremacv of law an justice; by placing wherever practicabi the machinery of ?dministration in tb hands of the inhabitants; by institntin needed sanitary reforms; by spreadin education; by fostering industry an trade; by inculcating public morality and, in short, by raking every rations step to aid the Cuban people to acrai to that plane of seif conscious respec and self reliant unity which fits an ec lightened community for self go very meut within irs own sphere, while en abling it to fulfill all outward oblig.i tions. Philippines Problem. On the 10th of D>c3:nb?r, th treaty of peac.i between the Unite* States and Spain was signed. Ir prc viced, arnon:: orher things, tba: Span should cede io the United States th archipelago known as the Phiiippim islands; that the Uu:;ed States shouh pay to Spain the sum of twenty million of dollars, and thar the civil rights ant political status of the native inhabitant of the territories thus ceded to th United States should be determined bi the congress. Tho treaty was ratifi?e by the senate on the Otb. of February 1^99. and by the government of Spair on the 19th of March following. Tnt ratifications were exchanged on the 2 Iel of April, and the treaty publicly pro claimed. On the 2nd of March the con gress voted the sum contemplated bj the treaty and the amount was paie over to the Spanish government on thc 1st of May. In this manner the Philippines came to the United States. The islands were ceded by the government of Spain, which had been in undisputed posses sion of them for centuries. They wer? accepted, not merely by our anthorized agents in Paris under the direction ol the executive, but by the constitutional and well considered action of the repre? sentatives of the people in both houses of congress. I had every reason to be? lieve, and I still believe, that this trans? fer of sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes and the aspirations 01 the great mass of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment, no oppor? tunity was lost of assuring the people of the i-lands of our ardent desire for their welfare, and or che intention of this government to do everything pos? sible to advance their interests. Aguinaldo's Claim. The olnini of tho rebel leader that he was promised independence by any offi? cer of the United Stares in return for his assistance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove ir. The most the insurgent leader hoped for when he came to Manila was the liberation of the island's from the Span? ish control, which rhey^had been labor? ing tor years without success to throw off The prompt accomplishment of this work by the American army and navy gave him other ideas and ambitions, and insidious -Uir^esnons from, various quarters tier verted the purposes and in? tentions with which he iiad taken up arms. No sooner had oar army captured Ma? nila than the Filipino forces began to assume an attitude of suspicion and hostility which the utmost efforts of our officers and troops were unabie tc disarm or modify. Their kindness and forbearance were taken as a proof ol cowardice. The aggressions of the Fili? pinos continually increased until finailv, jn<t before the time set by the senate o? che United Stares fir a vote unon the treaty; an attack, evidently prepared in advance, was made ail aloii^ tin- Amer? ican hues, which resulted :;i a terribly destructive and sanguinary repulse o! the rebels With a devotion and ^aiiantrv worthv of Ks mos: brilliant history, th" army, ably and loyally assisted by the navy, has carried on this unwelcome but mosl rig: teou* campaign with richly de? served success. Although their opera? tions have been somewhat interrupted ; and checked h. a raiuv season of uuu j sr..! I violence and duration, th^y hay.' i i ga.ned steadily m every direction and j ; now look forward confidently tu a s pee i y ! completion ot' tii-ir task. Everything indicares that with the j speedv suppression of the Tagalo rebe ? li?n, hie in the archipelago '.."ill soon ; : resume its ordinary courso under iii-.: ! protection o: our sovereignty and the ; people of those favored islands will en ! joy a prosperity and a freedom which chev have never before known. Cannot l?- Abandoned, j The future government of the Philip- j '? pines rests with the congress of the ! United ?tates. Fewer graver responsi- i I bilmas have ever been con lid ed to us. j If we accept them in a spirit worthy oi i our race and our traditions a great op I portuuitv comes with them. The ibiands lie under the shelter of ! our ?a g. They are ours by every title j or law and equity. They cannot be ! j abandoned Ir we desert them, we leave tnem at once to anarchy and fiuaiiy to barbarism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them unquestioned. Tneir rich plains and valleys would be the scene of enaiess strife and blood I shed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in Ma j niia bay instead of being, as we hope, I the dawn of a new day ot freedom and progress, will have been the beginning of an era of misery and violence worse tuan any which has darkened their un? happy past. The suggestion has been made that we could renounce our authority over the islands and giving them indepen? dence could retain a protectorate over them. This proposition will not be found, I am sure, worthy of your seri? ous attention. Such an arrangement would invoive at the outset a cruel breach of faith. It would place the peaceable and loyal majority, who ask for nothing better than to accept our authority, at the mercy ot the minority armed insurgents. It would make us responsible for the acts of the insurgent leaders and give us no power to control them. It would charge us with the task of protecting them against each orner and defending them against any foreign power with which they chose to quarrel. In short, it would take from the congress of the United States the ,power of declaring war and vest that tremendous preroga? tive in the Tagal leader of the hour. It does net seem desirable that I should recommend at this time a spe? cific and final form of government for j these islands. When peace shall be re- ! stored it wiil be the duty of congress to j construct a pian of government which j shall establish and maintain freedom and order and peace in the Philippines. 1 The insurrection is still existing and j when it terminates further information will be required as to the actual condi? tion of affairs before inaugurating a permanent scheme of civii government. 'Until congress shall have made known the formal expression of its will, I shall use the authority vested in me by the constitution and the statutes to uphold j the sovereignty of the United States in I those distant islands, as in all other I places where our flag rightfully floats, j Our flag has never waived over any : community but in blessing. I believe j the Filipinos will soon recognize the ! fact that it has not lost its gift of bene ! diction in this worldwide journey to j their shores. Porto Rican Affairs. I I recommend that legislation be had I with r?f?ren?a to the government of ! Porto Rico. The time is ripe for the ? adoption of a temporary form of gov ! eminent for this island. I* is desirable that the government of j the island, under the law cf belligerent ! rijjht, now maintained through the es . ecutive department, should be super- j i seeled by an administration entirely j civil in its nature. For the present pur j pose I recommend that congress pass a j law for the organization of a temporary j government which shall provide for the ; appointment by the president, subject j to confirmation by the senate, of a gov I ernor and such other officers as the gen ! eral administration of the island may j require and for legislative purposes, on j subjects of a local nature not partaking of a federal character. A legislative council, composed partly of Porto Ricans and partly of citizens of the United States, shall be nominated and appointed by the president. Lynch Law Condemned. The love of law and the sense of obe? dience and submission to the lawfully constituted judicial tribunals, are em? bedded in the hearts of our people, and any violation of these sentiments and disregard of their obligations, justly arouses public condemnation. The guarantees of life, liberty, and of civil rights, should be faithfully upheld, the right of trial by jury respected and de j fended. Those who, in disregard of law and the public peace, unwilling to await the judgment of court and jury, consti? tute themselves judges and executioners should not escape the severest penalties for their crimes. Great Opportunities. Presented to this congress are great I opportunities; with them come great j responsibilities. Toe power confided to us increases the weight of our obliga? tions to the people, and we must be pro? foundly sensitive of them as we conten?- j plate the new and grave problems which j confront us. Aiming only at the pub- j lie good, we cannot err. A right inter- i pretation of the people's will, and of ? duty, cannot fail to insure wise meas- j ores for the welfare of the islands which I have come under the authority of the ? United States, and to iuure to the com- . mon interest, and lasting honor of our j conni ry. Never has this nation had more abundant cause than during the ; past year for thankfulness to God for ? manifold blessings and mercies, for J which we make reverent acknowledge ! meat.
