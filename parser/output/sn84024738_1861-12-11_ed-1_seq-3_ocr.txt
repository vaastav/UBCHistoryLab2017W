'iwo persons occnpiofl the car, one a lady aud the other a gen He man.

The lady Wea the wif.- of oneot General Mct.'lellan's staff. Thespeeial train, as It pa***_ ihe principal militarr sta tions attracted the attention of the troops who were loitering about. They gazed at the occupants of the car, supposing them to be somedislinguished strangers from abroad. llie train arrived at Kaltimore, where the parties were to meet friend., from the We3t.— An explosion ol a locomotive on the Western r.ad, causing the instant de.th of the engi neer and tlr.maii, delayed their friends, and kept ihe B_raa_era la Baltutort several hours.

REPORTED I)!_*«iiIEE.IIKMT 15 THE C___UB__T— A> All'llMPl TO eauuTH IT OVEB. From the following we should infer that Bennett s correspondent has been instructed to Invent some pretext by which to make it appear that the reported diili.ulty between old Abe and his Cabinet had no foundation in fact. The eitort, however, is fruitless, for tho facts of a disagreement between them, com luunicated by more than one Washington correspondent, too plainly indicate that the rupture is of a serions character and may yet eventuate iv a complete dissolution of the whole concern. "We give below what the _7..!.._. telegraphic correspondent say?, under date of Washington, December 4 : Tl'.ere is a class of people in this city who employ their time in in venting falsehoods and circulating them, and when any of these re ports reach the newspapers the inventors thereof chnc'tle In their sleeves and boast that they have sold somebody. Yesterday i and last night the class of persona alluded to started the absurd report that there had been a row iv Hie Cabinet, and v. it the quarrel was chiefly between Sew'trd and Came ron; that the former announced hi_ in teution to resign if Cameron, report waa not changed, and mat Cameron swore he Y.oui__ lestgn if it waa; and, Anally, that it was agreed that it should be partially altered; that Cameron submitted gracefally, a;ul harmony was restored This whole sta te meiit was an invention of a iellow who hud heeu snubbi d by Gen. Cameron, because iho latter had refused to comply wiiii the for mer's demand., for contrails. The falsifier was sent for by a Government olticer and properly reprimanded. That the Meaaaga aud reports were examined i.nii properly d:s --i caseed, and is thepraetioa (a such nana, is true some were perhaps modified; but that j the .est of good feeling prevailed between the President and diiieretit members of the Cabinet, and that such feeling exist-, now, is a positive and well known fact. 

WHAT THE SEW TOKK HBBALD 9AV_ OP OLD AKT-'S ■____**, From the following editorial remarks of I the New York Herald, of the oth inst., we should not be surprised if Bennett'a animos ity towuids the abolitionists of the North did not yet induce him to hoist the banner of t-eaee, as the most effectual method by which to bread, down that party : Tiie President's Message, oa ihe slavery question, will reassnre the country, and give new heart aad renewed Impe io the loyal men of the South, awaiting their deliverance.— Our disorganizing abolitionists are taken aback, aud will soon begin tn sho .v their te-th, no doubt; but .is "Honest Old Abe has "set his loot down firmly," the two houses of Con gress will sustain him. The oniy trouble to be appiehended is from such abolition dis turbera of the public harmony as .Sumner — Bnt let ihe conseivative men in Congress be Arm and decided, and everything will come outright. We shall soon pat down ihis re bellion, restore the Union, and resume with a new impulse of great power our glorious career of peaceful prosperity. THK CKA-t/irBB OF OUR
