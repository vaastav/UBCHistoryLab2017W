WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular correspondent. Wash I SOTOS, December , iHsii. The President left here to-day for a short western trip. After visiting j Chicago, he will go to Indianapolis ami attend lo some important private business before returning to Wash ington. The Senate has, by lot, determined the length of the terms of the six new Senators as follows; \\ ashing ton—Senator Squi r „ expires March 3, IHO 1, and Senator Allen, March 3, 1*93; South Dakota—Senator Moody, March 3, I*9l, and Senator Petti grew, March 3, 1803; North Dako ta —Senator Pierce, March 3, I*9’, and Senator Casey, March 3, 18113. The terms of the Montana Senators will not he fixed until they occupy their seats. Judge David J. Rrewei, of Kan sas, lias been nominated by the Pres ident lo he Associate Justice of the Supreme Court lo till the vacancy caused hy the death of the late Jus tice Stanley Matthews, of Ohio. Judge Brewer is a nephew of Jus tice Stephen J. Field, of the Su preine Court; he lots been since 1884 United Stales Judge for the eighth circuit of Kansas. He has tilled a number of important positions in Kansas, judicial and otherwise, and has always been a popular official. The nomination is highly pleasing 10 Senators Ingalls and Plumb, and in fuel to everybody, with the possi ble exception of several disappoint ed candidates and their immediate friends. Justice Miller, over whose circuit Judge Brewer has presided for the last five years, says he con siders him one of the ablest judges now on the bench. W hen Justice Brewer takes his seal on the bench with his Uncle Justice Field, it will he the first time in the history of the court that two of the contemporary justices have been so nearly related. Owing to the organization of the House on Monday the President’s message was not read to Congress until Tuesday. 'The message has been well received by everybody ex cept a handful of southerners who profess to see in its plain statement of the condition of political affairs in the south cause for alarm. The message is strictly conservative, both in tone and in its recommenda tions, being thereby in striking con trast to the hist dictatorial docu ments sent from the White House to Congress. Mr. 1 larnson evident ly intended this message to ho con fined to its strict constitutional 11 mils—that of informing Congress of the state of the country. Its recommendations arc in every in stance what has been approved by the Republican party. Upon those things on w hich there are different opinions in the party he has present ed the facts without recommenda tion. It is a document that has greatly disappointed the Democrats because il furnishes them with no ammunition. Next in importance lo the Presi dent’s message is Secretary Win doin’s annual report to Congress, which was made public ou Wednes day. Mr. Wiudom covers the entire tinaucial field and furnishes one of the most interesting as well as im portant reports of the kind ever made. It presents a plan for the sun sfaelory solution of the silver problem, which Mr. Wiudom be lieves will be accepted by both sil ver and gold men. Space prevents further notice of the report, but it should be carefully read by every i nlelligeut citizen of the country. It may be obtained by addressing Secretary Wtndom. The organization of the House was attended by a little circumstance that shows the danger which will constantly menace the majority dur ing the session. After Reed had been elected Speaker, McPherson Clerk, Holmes Sergeantat-Arms, Adams Docrkecpi . r’d M ’.cat post | ii. .t 1 , il. ndersoU, I as chairman of the Republican cau cus, nominated Rev. C. R. Ramsdell for Chaplain. Representative (.'beadle, of Indiana, bolting the caucus nomination, moved to strike out the name of Mr. Ramsdell and substitute that of Dr. Mil!.urn, the blind preacher, who was Chaplain <A the last House. Mr. Cheadle was supported outright by three Republicans—Moore,of New Hamp shire, Lebblack, of New Jersey, and Ewart, ol North Carolina and enough refrained from voting to elect Dr. Milburn, who received 166 votes to Mr. Ram-dell’s 155, the Democrats voting solidly for Mil burn. This is of itself a small thing, but il the party caucus can lie successfully bolted in small things, there is nothing lo prevent the same tiling being dune when something important is at stake. Secretary Noble has gone to St. Louis, his former home, to look after some private matters. He is ex pected hack early next week. i Career and Death of Jefferson Da vis. Jefferson Davis died at New r Or leans fifteen minutes before 1 o’clock j last Friday morning, in the presence • and Ids wife and a few friends and relatives. His death was painless. The news was received with sorrow in southern cities. The War De partment at Washington deemed it advisable that no official action be taken on his death, his citizenship never having been restored. Jefferson Davis will occupy a con spicuous place in American history and in the history of the world. By his ability, Ins energy and ambition he ruse, forty years ago, to the front rank of American statesmen. He was a leading advocate of the prin- J ciple which had existed in many minds since the foundation of the Government, that the Union was a mere loose compact between inde pendent stales, which any of them, so far as its own part was concerned, | could cancel at its will, anil that there existed no power in the gen eral government to enforce the terms I of the contract on a slate so repudi aling its conditions. the opposite principle—that the Union was an indestructible constitutional forma tion, incapable of dissolution or | destruction in any of its powers, and that the Government had in nately the power to use any agencies of peace or war lo preserve its own existence —was that which the seces sion leaders rejected and denied. As the Union grew in territory, as the people grew in intelligence, and as the public conscience became en lightened, the conviction that human slavery was a great moral wrong came into possession of the minds of the non-slaveholding people of the country. Rut the system existed | under state laws, and the pernicious principle of state rights became its S most powerful bulwark. This fact, in return, strengthened the political leaders of the slaveholding states in I their adherance lo stale-rights prin j ciples, which they finally attempted | to enforce in action when Abraham Lincoln was elected as an anti-slav ery President. They waged war against the Union through four long | and bloody years, and they were ; conquered; their cause was destroyed and their slaves were liberated as the result. The rebel states contained 12,U00,000 inhabitants, or one-third of the entire population of the country at that time. In this war over 2,200,000 men were engaged on ! the side of the Union, and about 1 half that number constituted the ■ rebel armies, who fought almost en tirely on the defensive, on inner | linos and behind entrenchments. The deaths in the Union army num bered about 340,000, those in the rebel army about 300,000. The cost of the war to the nation was *6,000,- | 000,000. The Con federate campaigns 1 cost *2,000,000,000 in their currency; their losses in slave property were #400,000,000, and their other prop erly losses were simply inestimable. Their territory and cities were made desolate, and the people were made homeless and penniless. Jefferson Davis was President of the rebel government, which he ad ministered as long as the Confeder acy existed. He was the official representative and leader of the greatest rebellion in history. In his 1 defeat a pernicious principle in politics, which had been a menacing dement in the Nation from the be ginning, was destroyed. Slavery was abolished. The cause of dis loyalty and treason was hopelessly lost. The right and the duly of the Government to enforce obedience on recalcitrant stales were estab lished. The sublime principle ot in indestructible Union was placed on an impregnable foundation. Ine rebel President was made a prisoner while attempting an ignoble flight and escape; he was ironed and placed in coutineinent, and was two \ cars afterward liberated ou bail, weanD*' these bonds of the law to the close of his life. A man who reached such an ele vation—who, guided or misguided, the destinies of so many men and ot so great though so wicked a cause who experienced a disaster and a downfall so complete, so utterly beyond repair and so inglorious, can have none other but a conspicuous place in history. His deluded fol lowers—“hi* people,” as they were ••ailed hy him, and as they called themselves, after his overthrow to the last—will cherish his memory with tenderness and reverence. But it is a weakness and a madness. By all patriots who love the Union, the Hag and the laws, by their posterity lo the remotest time, hy impartial history when its judgment shall be made up, he wall be execrated as the cause and author of a greater evil, of greater distress, of greater losses in life and property than ever afflict ed any other people. He fell from a bad eminence, and in his fail eternal justice and the ways of God to man were vindicated. —Chicago Inter-Ocean.

It can be prevented in thousands of cases. True croup never appears without due and timely warning; a few hours, or a day or two before the attack, the child becomes hoarse. T his hoarseness is the first indica tion of croup, and is a sure sign that croup is to follow unless prompt ly and properly treated. The free use of Chamberlain’s Cough Reme dy as directed with each bottle, un der the heading “To prevent croup,” will dispel all symptoms of the disease. The proper way, is to keep a bottle of this remedy at hand. It costs but 50 cents, and only a few’ doses, or at most not over one-third of a bottle, is required to dispel all symptoms of the disease. Can you afford to risk so much for so little? There is not the least danger in giving this remedy in largo and frequent doses, which are always required, as it contains no injurious substance. It, is also invaluable for oulds and whooping-cough. For sale by W. H. Prideaux. Mason & Hamlin Piano-Forts and organs S. T.
