GEN. GATACRE'S RETREAT. Promised Additional Reports or the Dle mter to the British Arms Not Yet Received. London, Dec. 12, 4:40 a. m. Xo fur ther news has been received to remove Hie mystery overhanging Gen. Cat acre's mystetious retreat from Stormberg-. He has not yet forwarded the jroniised additional message, and the censorship has prevented the corre spondents from explaining- the matter. While it appears to be sfeneralK- ad Tnilted lhat Gen. (intaere is iitct'ned to overwork his men. Lord Mthv,or.3 remarks are considered as in t'dtiier bad tasta Slrnnscr Position Than Lain'n Stormberjf is described as a strong er position than Laing's Xek. The only road winds through lofty hills, and i!ankii' is impossible. Colesburg is lilso siiid to be an almost impregnable position, and as no troop are availa ble to reinforce the columns acting in those directions, it becomes evident that (ien. Gatacre'smisfortune or error will delay the invasion of the Free tate, perhaps some weeks. It is ex ceedingly probable that he will be compelled to retire on Queenstown, uml 1o wait for reinforcements, which can hardly reach him until Sir Charles AVarren's division arrives at the Cape. The first detachments will sail Satur day next. Even if Gen. French is not compelled to retreat he will be obliged to pause in his advance. It now seems certain that the sev enth division, which is beinf mobilized :i Aldershot, will also be sent to South Africa. Uoer HeportM Sot Confirmed. No news has yet lieen received con firming the liuet report of the capture of 50 prisoners at Modder TJiver fron Lord Methoen's column.

The l'oers captured three Lritish guns in the engagement with Gen. Gataere's force at Stormberg. The sonic at Kimberley last Satur day was an attempt to take the Boer position at Kamperdam, and to secure the waterworks. All the British shots fell short.

The naval 4.7-inch gun again took up a position north of the camp this afternoon, while the bouitzer battery was posted south east on the left of the Boers. Both opened a hot tire with lyddite shells and shrapnel, to which the Boers sharply replied with a dozen gun.-?, thus unmasking their position, which was the object of the British maneu ver. An Hour's Firine. After an hour's firing, the Boer guns were silenced, Ihe howitzers searched the tienches, and then threw shell after shell upon the hills, the explosion of the lyddite causing the whole ground over an extensive area to rise in the air iu dense, brown clouds. A Boer Gun Dismantled. A Boer long gun was dismantled. It now appears that the Boers in tend that the next fight is to. take place at Magcrsfontein. Apparently Spytfonteiu is not defended, or the Boers are unwilling to unmask their position there, as the replies to the British artillery were all from guns at Magersfontein. A Blotr at the Trust.

WINTER MANAGEMENT. How to Keep Young- and Old Poultry in Excellent Condition During the Severe Season. To keep a poultry house dry and warm line the side with tarred paper, place loose boards or fence rails over head and fill the loft, with chaff (clover (Laff is best). It absorbs all the dampness arising from the expired air of the fowls, keeps the house warm and comfortable, and the chafj is ready to pack eggs in for shipping in the siiiing. The great secret of suc cessful poultry raising is to keep the houses and runs dry and clean. Breed from vigorous, healthy ancestors (with a frequent introduction of new blood), and keep' up a continual warfare against the lice. Sprinkle the houses every two weeks with a strong solu tion of carbolic acid. This not only destroys the vermin, but is one of the best disinfectants that can be used. It destroys the germs or bacteria that produce cholera, gapes and other in fectious diseases among fowls. Buy a bee smoker and a few pounds of long green tobacco, and when a hen hatches her brood, put the little chicks in a basket, cover them over and give them a thorough smoking with tobac co. Tre.it the old lien to a dose in like manner. The tobacco will make the little fellows giddy, but will not in jure them. This procedure will kill every louse and does it immediately. If they arc very lousy you will find the bottom oT the basket lined with them after smoking them. Three drops of carbolic acid in one ounce of sweet oil is a good remedy to kill lice. Put a little on the top of the heads of chicks and under the wings. Avoid doctoring your fowls unless they are sick. American Gardening. OCCULT INFORMATION.
