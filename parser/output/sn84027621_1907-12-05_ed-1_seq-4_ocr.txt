withdrawals from the antisaloon pe i j tition but on checking up the same j it was found that only 1ST names out i I i of the claimed Sao were on the anti saloon petition which showed that i j 663 men had asked to be withdrawn j i I from something they had never sign j ed The petition asking for a wet or J dry election after the 1ST names j were withdrawn contained 1163 sigI 1 natures which number was 363 more j names than the law requires Had j there never been a name stricken I from the registration books by Mr i Beck the registration officer there i Ii would have been 53 names more than j needed to call the election Of the 1ST names withdrawn from the peti tion only twentyfive of them were whites An amusing part of the withdrawal I of the names consisted in the fact that in the examination of the signatures yesterday whole pages were thrown I out which were recognized as for Ii geries When Mr Mathews of the county commissioners grew tired of the work Mr N A Fort relieved him Several of the AntiSaloon men who were deeply interested in the petition when they entered the county com missioners room to present their peti tion had their nerves badly shaken when before the petition could be laid Ion the desk Attorney O T Green for the saloon men threw down a paper and announced that they demanded S50 names to be withdrawn from the petition when presented and also ask ed

NEEDED II Ii Editor Star I observe a tendency on the part ofseveral people who have written articles regarding Mr John D Robertsons candidacy for mayor to apologize for him Mr Robertson they say has his faults is no angel etc This kind of talk makes me consid erable weary Ito not think any one on this terrestrial ball knows from personal experience just what an angel is like As for faults I have known John Robertson the last ten years and if he has any more faults than any of the rest of us I have not been able to find them out It is true that John generally looks more like a labor ing man than a capitalist but as he always has been that way it cant be charged up against his desire for of fice liceThe The voters of Ocala are not looking for angels or men better than them selves They would either look for ever or be badly fooled Neither do they desire for a Solomon to come to judgment The public spirit of a man who loves to spend his own money in beautifying his home city the business acumen which knows when the pub lic is getting the value of Its money the practical justice that cuts thro the maze of legal complication to shield the innocent or fit the punish ment to the crimethese are the qual ifications Ocala requires in its mayor and John D Robertson has them all Let his friends vote him into office if they can but make no more apologies He needs no more than any other man who has been or is likely to be mayor of Ocala A First Ward Voter THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE Unusual interest attached to the message of President Roosevelt deliv ered to Congress yesterday afternoon erAJ After congratulating the country upon its immense resources and the vast volume of its current business the en president moralizes at some length on the necessity for upright conduct and fair dealing on the part of those im mense corporations which have come ee to control so much of the business He justifies the recent legislation in re straint of abuses and promises a con tinuance of that policy He asks for additional legislation along this line and that the antitrust law may be made more effective While not pressing any special plan nn he advises additional legislation upon the currency system of the country with a view to making the volume of money more elastic and to prevent any sudden stoppage of the wheels of bus iness He admits that no legislation can successfully counteract the effects of private folly and bad judgment but asks that Congress undertake to devise s me cautionary law He adheres to the protective tariff 11e principle but suggests a moderate amount of revision and reduction where the pinch is worst He insists that income and Inheritance taxes should be made a part of the federal system He suggests an employers liability law for the benefit of work men In labor matters the president com mends the eighthour day to favorable ant ble attention and urges the enactment of law for the compulsory investiga tion and adjustment oflabor disputes between employers and their et JSU employes He favors the improvement of inland waterways and the reclama tion of lands by irrigation and drain age Work on the Panama canal Is proceeding satisfactorily The presi dent recommends the establishment of ofal postal savings banks and suggests al consideration of the parcels post b uti without recommendation He urges the passage of ship subsidy Altogether the message is a very able document presented in simple English shh and divested of the stilted style which has characterized earlier documents from the same pen It is in its tone and recommendations surprisingly in accord with public sentiment Tampa Times
