CLEVELAND'S POLICY. HIS VIEWS ON EXISTING FINANCIAL QUESTION. He Takes rosition Plainly in Favor of Gold Mononietalismn. Against Free Bauks and against Free Silver. President Cleveland, in his annual message to Congress, read on Tuesday the 3rd inst., devoted unusual attun tion to the financial ouestions which now agitate the people of the country. After a careful review of the treasury conditions which necessitated the sale of bonds to replenish the gold reserve, Mr. Cleveland says: Though the amount of gold drawn from the treasury appears to be very large, as gathered from the facts and figures herein presented. it was actual ly much larger. considerable sunis having been acquired by the treasury within the several periods stated with out the issue of bonds. On the 28th of January, 1S95, it was reported by the secretary of the treasury that more than $172,000,000 of gold had been withdrawn for hoarding or shi'ment during the year preceding. He now reports that from Jan. 1, 1879. to July 14, 1890, a period of more than II years, only a little over $28,000,000 was withdrawn, and that between July 14, 1890, the date of the passage of the law for an increased purchase 'of silver, and the 1st day of Decem ber, 1895, or within less than five and a half years, there was withdrawn nearly $375,000,000. making a total of more than $403,000,000 drawn from the treasury in gold since Jan. 1, 1S79, the date fixed in 1875 for the retire ment of the United States notes. 

PAYING DEBTS ANI) LEAVING THEM DUE. ---a ly $327,000,000 of the gold thus withdrawn has been paid out on these United States notes. and yet every one of the $346,000, 000 is still uncalled and reaav to do service in future gold de pletions. More than $76,000,000 in gold has since their creation in 1890, been paid out from the treasury upon the notes given on the purchase of sil ver by the government; and yet the whole, amounting to $155,000,000, ex cept a little more than $16,000,000, which have been retired by exchange for silver at the request of the holders, remains outstanding and prepared to join their older and more experienced allies in future raids upon the treasu ry's gold reserve. In other words,the government has paid in gold more tnan nine-tenths of its United States and still owes them all. It has paid in gold about one-half of its notes given for silver purchases without extin gnishing by such payment one dollar of those notes. when, added to all this we are reminded to carry on this as tounding financial scheme the govern ment has incurred a bonded indebted ness of $95,500,000 in establishing a gold reserve, and of $162,315,400 in efforts to maintain it that the annual interest charge on such bonded indebt edness is more than $11,000,000; that a continuance in our present course may result in further bond issues, and that we have suffered or are threatened with all this for the sake of supplying gold for foreign shipment or facilitat ing its hoarding at home, a situation is exhibited which certainly ought to arrest attention and provoke immedi ate legislative relief. I am convinced the only thoroughly and, practicable remedy for our troubles is, found in the retirement and cancellation of our United States notes commonly called greenbacks and the outstanding notes issued by the government in payment of silver purchases under the act of 1890. I believe this could be quite readily acomplished by the exchange of these notes for United States bonds of small as well as large denomina tions bearing a low rate of interest. They should be long termed bonds, thus increasing their desirability as investments, and because their pay mzent could be well postponed to a period far removed from present fi wancial burdens and perplexities,when with increased prosperity and resour ces they would be more easily met. A PLW TO 

CANCEL NOTES. To further insure the cancellation of these notes and also provide a way hy which gold may be added to our currency in lieu of them, a feature in the plan should be an authority given to the secretary of the treasury to dis pose of the bonds abroad for gold if necesry to complete the contemplat -ed red emption and cancellation, per . mitting imto use the proceeds of such bonds to take up and cancel any of the notes that may be in the treas ury or that may be received by the government on any account. The in crease of our bonded debt involved im this plan would be amply compensat ed by renewed activity and enterprise ini all business circles, the restored confidence at home, the reinstated faithin our monetary strength abroad, and, the stimulation of every interest and industry that would follow th~e cancellation of the 'gold demandrobhi gations now affecting us. In any event~the bonds proposed would stand for the extinguishment of a trouble some indebtedness, while in the path we now follow there lurks the menace of unending bonds, with our indebt edness still undischarged and aggra vated in every feature. The obliga tions necessary to fund this indebted ness would not equal in amount those from which we have beeui relieved since 1884 by anticipation and pay ment beyond the requirements of the sinking fund out of our surplus reve nues. LATITUDE FOR NATIONAL BANKS. The currency withdrawn by the re tirement of the United States notes and treasury notes amounting to prob ably less than $486,000,000, migh~t be supplied by such gold, as wou'ld be used on their retirement or by an in crease in the circulation of our nation al banks. Though the aggregate cap ital of those now in existence amounts to more than $664,000,000, their out standing circulation, based on bond security, amounts to only about $19, 000,000. They are authorized to issue notes amounting to 20 per cent. of the bonds deposited to secure their circula tion, but in no event beyond the amount of their capital stock~and they are obliged to pay 1 per cent. tax on the circulation they issue. I think they should be allowed to issue circu Jation equal to the par value .of the bonds they deposit to secure it, and that the tax on their circulation should be reduced to i of 1 per cent., which would undoubt edly meet the expense the gov ernment incurs on their account In addition they should be allowed to substitute or deposit in lieu of bonds niow sequired as security for their cir culation, those which would be issued for the purpose of retiring the United States notes and treasury notes. The banks alread existing, if they desired to avail themselves of the provisions of law thus modified, could issue circula -tion in addition to that already out standing, amounting to $478,u00,000 which would nearly or quite equal the currency proposed to be cancelled. At any rate 1 should confidently ex pect to see the existing national banks or others to be organized, avail them selves of the proposed encouragements to issue circulation and promptly f ill every vacum and supply every cur rency need. It has always seemed to me that the provisions of law regard in h apital of national banks which ope-rate as a limitation to their location fails to imake proper compensation for the sup pression of State banks, which camtle near to the people in all sections of the country and readily furnished them with banking accomodations and fa cilities. Aiv incoriveniience or em barr-assment arising from these re strictions on the location of national banks might Vvell be remned:cd by bet ter adapting the present sy tei to the creation of banks in snusller conim nities or by permitting banks of large capital to ~etablish branches in such localities as would serve the people. so regulated and rest rained as to secure their safe and conservative contro l and nianagement. ]-it there might not be the iecCessity for such an addi tion to the curiey by new issues of bank circulationl as at tirst glance is indicated. If we should be relieved from iaintaini ng a gold reserve un der conditions. that constitute it, the barometer of ouir solvency, and if our treasury should Ino longe-r be the fool ish purveyor 4f gold for nations abroad or for speculation and hoard ing by our citizens at home. I should expect to see gold resume its natural and normal functions in the business affairs of the country and cease to be an object attracting the timid watch of our people and exciting their sensitive imaginations. 

FINANCIALLY ILL. I do not overlook the fact that the cancellation of the treasury notes issu ed under the silver puichasing act of 189, would leave the treasury in the actual ownership of sufficient silver, including seigniorage. to coin nearly $178.000,00o in standard dollars It is worthy of consideration whether this might not, from time to time. be con verted into dollars or factional coin and slowly put intc circulation, as im the judgement of the secretary of the treasurv the necessities of the country should require. Whatever is attempt ed should be entered upon fully ap preciating the fact that by careless, easy descent we have reached a dan ge.ous depth and that our ascent will not be accomplished. We shall be wise if we realize that we are financi ally ill and that our restoration to health may require heroic treatruent and unpleasant remedies. NOT AFFECTED BY REvENUE. In the present stage of our ditlicul ty, it is not easy to understand how the amount of our revenue receipts di rectly affect it. The important ques tion is not the quantity of money re ceived in revenue payments, but the kind of money we manintain and our ability to continue in sound financial condition. We are considering the governments holdings of gold as rela ted to the soundness of our monev and as affecting our national credit and monetary strength. If our golI reserve had never been impaired; if no bonds had ever been issued to replenish it: if there had been no fear and timidity concerning our ability to continue gold payments; if any part of our revenues were now paid in gold, and if we could look to our gold receipts as a means of main taining a safe reserve, the amount of our revenues would be an influential factor in the problem. But unfortu nately, all the circumstances that might lend weight to this considera tion are entirely lacking. THE 

GOVERN3ENTS POSITION. In our preseht predica~e'it, no gold is received by the government in pay ment of revenue charges, nor would there be if their revenues were increas ed. The receipts of the treasury wher not in silver certificates, consist of United States notes and treasury notes issued for silver purchases. These forms of money are only useful for the government in paying its current ordinary exnenses and its quality it governient~ possession does not in the least contribute towvard giving us that kind of safe financial standing or condition which is built on gold alone. If it is said that if these notes, if held by the government, cant be used to oh tan gold for our reserve, thE answer 1s easy. The people draw gold1 from th treasury on demand upon Lnited States notes and treasury notes, but the proposition that the treasury cat on demand draw gold from the people would be regarded in these days with wonder and amazement, and even If this could be done, there is nothing to prevent those thus parting with their gold from regaining it the next day-o the next hour by the presentation of the notes they received in exchange for it. The secretary of the treasury might use such notes taken from the people as surpliis revenue to buy gol n the market, of course he could not do this without paying a premium. Private holders of gold. unlike: the government, having no parity t maintain, would not be restrained from making the best bargain possi ble when they furnish gold to the treasury, but the moment the secreta ry of the treasury bought gold on any terms above par. he would establisha general and universal premitun upor it, thus breaking down the parity be tween gold and silver, which the gov emnent is pledged to maintain and opening the way -to new and serious comlications. In the meantime the preium would not remain stationary and the absurd spectacle might be pre sented of a dealer selling gold to the government and with United States notes or treasury notes in his hand uim mediately clamoring for its return, and as a rule at a higher premium. AN OVERFLOWING TREASURY ABUsED. It will, however, be readily seen that the government could not refuse to pay out United States notes and treas ury notes in current transactions whet demanded and insist on paying out sil ver alone and still maintain the parity between that metal and the currency represnting gold. Besides the aceu mulation in the treasury of, currency of any kind exacted from the people throuhg taxation is justly regarded as an evil and it can not proceed far without vio-erous protests against and unjustifiabe retension of money fror the business of the country and as de nunciation of a scheme of taxation which proves itself to be unjust when it takes fronm the- earnings and income of the citizen's money so much in ex cess of the needs of government sum ply that large sums can be gathered and kept in the treasury. Such a con dition has heretofore in times of sur plus revenue led the - government to restore currency to the people by the purchase of its unmatured bonds ata large premium and by a large increase of its deposits in national banks and we easily remember that the abuse of treasury~ acaumulation has finisheda most persuasive argument in favor of legislation radically reducing our taril taxation. G;OLD) ONLY, IN DEMAN I. Perhaps it is supposed that sullicient revenue receipts would in a sentimien tal way improve the situation a oy. in spiring confidence in our solvency an allaing the fear of pecuniary exhaus ion. but all through our struggles tc maintain our gold reserve there never has been any apprehension as to our ready ability to pay our way with such money' as we had and the ques tion whether or not our curremr re ceipts met our cuirrenit expenses has not entered into the estimate of. om solvency. < f course the general statt of our funds, exclusive of gold was en tirely immaterial to thre foreign creditor and investor. Ihis debt could only be paid in gold anid his only concern wva ur own. but all silver to ' Ls last ration with gold. Our at Xmipt to ac-oniplish this by the free oinage of silver at a ratio' differing :idv from actual values would be - le :,iznal for the complete departure ly f gold from our circulation, the im- M iediate and large contraction of our er irculating medium and a shrinkage a -i the real value and monetary eflici- ht ncy of all other forms of currency as o lev settle. to the level of silver ino- re; nnetallism. Every one who receives jo fixed salary, and every worker for aaes would find the dollar in his sli and ruthlessly scaled down to the .a oint of bitter disappointient if not qu > pinching privation. A change in ur standard to silver mononetallism to -ould also bring on a collapse of the lt utire system of credit. which is re- or onized and adopted by the - world of S usinesq, is many tinies more potent ur ud uaseful than the entire volume of in urency, and is safely capable to if aeet the growth of trade and enter- at rise. In a self-invited struggle, or irough darkness and uncertainty, ur humilation would be increased by sh onsciousness that we had parted com- mi any with all the enlightened and ar rogressive nations of the world and hc rerc desperately and hopelessly striv- li ig to meet the stress of modern corn- th ierce and competition with a debased fic nd unsuitable currency and in our as- di ociation with the few weak and lag- el ard nations which have silver alone de s their standard of value. h< AN EARNEST PLEA FOR (LD. m Our country's indebtedness. wlie- v her owing by the government or ex- re ting between individuals, has been pE ontracted with reference to our pres- in nt standard. To decree by act of con- di .ress that these debts shall be payable th a less valuable dollars than those to -ithin the contemplation and inten ion of the parties when contracted se vould operate to transfer by the flat- e I law and without compensation, an ti, mount of property and a volume of bs ights and interests almost iucalcul- ti< ble. Those who advocate a blind and su eadlong plunge to free coinage in so he naie of bimetailism and profess- di ng the belief, contrary to all experi- st nee, that we could thus establish a di ouble standard and a concurrent cir- be ulation of both metals in our coinage, I .re certainly reckoning from a cloudy cl tandpoint. Our present standard of pi 'alue is the standard of the civilized th vorld, and permits the only bimetal- fu ism now possible, or at least that is I vithin the independent reach of any ai ingle nation, however powerful that ei Lation may be, while the value of gold ci s a standard is fixed by almost univer- I al commercial and business use, it v Loes not despise silver nor seek its ex 0anishment. Wherever this standard o s maintained there is at its side in free nd unquestioned circulation a vol- ,C tme of sil'ver currency sometimes o: quafling and sometimes even exceed ng it in amount, both maintained at a r iarity notwithstanding a depreciation st >r fluctuation in the intrinsic value of ilver. PI at Shocking Crimes in Turkey. LosDos, Dec. 2.-Constantinople at .dvices to the United Press under yes- rE erday's date say that the official re- la >orts of the disturbances in Caeserea ei n the 30th ult., state the disorder was n lue to two Armenians discharging if uis in the market place.

Thr Armenian o chool was bnrned and then began the st ttack upon the Christians. The v >ildings in which they were was also ei et on fire. The Christians were with. e< ut weapons of any sort and trusted v intirely to the government to protect al hem. The Americans remained in n he girl's seminary until that building sa was set on fire, and then they appealed b. o the governor for protection. They fi >btained a .guard of soldiers, all but ei wo 'of whom afterwards deserted. te hese two remained and carried out c, he orders issued to them to fight the h ires that had been kindled. The bur'- ei ng continued for two days. ir The Americans were stripped of ev- v rything but their clothing. All of d he Christians villages around were e: >hrned by the Kurds.

In the meantime extensive I shipients of gold and other unifavor- t able indications caused restlessness c and fright among our peoule at home. v T1 hereupon the general state of our e funds, exclusive of gold, became a so e iniaterial to them, and they, too, I drew gold from the treasury for hoard- i ing against all contingencies. . This c is plainly shown by the large increase r in the prouortion of gold withdrawn T which was retained by our people as t time and threatening incidents pro- c gressed. During the fiscal year end- c ing June .30, 1894, nearly -),000,000 I in gold was withdrawn;fron the treas- I ury and about i7,,000,0)00 was sent N abroai, while during the tiscal year i ending June 30, 1S95. over 117,0010,- r 000 was drawn out, of which only a about $66,000.00i) was shipped, leaving s -the large balance of such withdrawals c to be accounted for by domestic hoard o ing. Inasmuch as the withdrawal of our gold has resulted largely from fright, there is nothing apparent that t will prevent its continuance or recur- 1 rence with its natural consequences, c except such a change in our financial E methods as will reassure the frighten- c ed and n-tke the desire for gold less i intense. It is not c.lear how any in- i crease in revenue, unless it be in gold, t can satisfy those whose only anxiety 1 is to gain gold from the government's store.

TILE TREASURY NEVER DEPLETED. I At no time when bonds have been t issued has there been any considera- i tion of the question of paying the ex- E penses of government with their pro- i ceeds. There was no necessity to con sider that question. At the time of 2 each bond issue we had a safe surplus s in the treasury for ordinary opera tions, exclusive of the gold in our re serve. fIn February, 1894, when the I first issue of bonds was made such sur- a plus amounted to over $1S,0(0,000 in November, when the second issue was i made, it amounted to more than $42,- 2 000,000; in February, 1S95, when s bonds for the third time were issued, < such surplus amounted to more than 1 41,000,000. It now amounts to i9S,- i 072,420.'30. Besides all this, the sec- z retary of the treasury had no authori- 1 ty whatever to issue bonds to increase tile ordinary revenues or pay current expenses. I can not but think there has been some confusion of ideas re garding the effects. of the. issue of a bonds and the results of the withdraw al of gold. RESPONSIBILITY OF slUNEiR. It is nieither unfair noi unjust 'to charge a large share of our present fi nancial perplexities and dangers to the operations of the laws of 187S and 1890 compelling the purchase of silver by the government, which not only fur. nished a new treastiry obligation upon which its gold could be withdrawn, but so increased the fear of an over whelming flood of silver and a forced descent to silver payments that even ] the repeal of these laws did not entire ly cure the evils of their existence. 

ARGUIENTS AG3AiNS'T SILVER . While .i have endeavored to make a< plain state~ment of the disordered con dition of our currency and the present< dangers menacing our prosperity,. and to suggest a way which leads to a 1 safer financial system, I have con- I stantly had in ~mind the fact thati many of my countrymen. whose sin -cerity I do not doubt, insist that the cure for the ills now threatening us I may be found in the single and sim ple remedy of the free coinage of sil-< ver. They contend that our mints shall be at once thrown open to the 1 free, unlimited and independent coin- 1 -age of both gold and silver dollars of futll legal tender quality, regard.less of 1 the action of any other government. ,< and in full view of the fact that the I ratio bet ween the metals which they suggest calls for one hundred cents, 1 worth of gold in the gold dollar at the present-~ standard, andi only fifty cents in intrinsic worth of silver iri the silver dollar were ther-e < infinitely stronger than can be adduced 1 for hoping that such action would se- 1 cure for us a bimetallic currency mov- < ing on lines of party, an experiment so novel and hazardous as that propos- 1 ed might well stagger . those who be- 1 lieve that stability is an imperative] condition of sound money. _No gov ernent, no human contrivance or . act of legislation has ever been able to hold the two meta.Js together in free < coinage at a ratio appreciably differenti from that which is established in the markets of the world. Those who be-1 lieve that our independent free coin age of silver at an artificial ratio with 1 gold of 16 to 1 would restore the pari- 1 ty between the metals and consequent-i lv between the coins oppose an un- 1 supportable and improbable theory to 1 the general belief and practice oIf oth- < e. r nationsand to the teachings of the wisest statesmen and economists of the 1 world, both in the -past and future,] and what is far more conclusive, they run counter to our own actual expe riences. Twice in our early history our lawmakers, in attempting to es tablish a bimetallic currency, under; I took fr-ee coinage on ratio which acci-< dentally varied from the actual rela tive values of the two metals not more( than three per cent. In both cases, I notwithstanding greater dilliculties and cost of transportation than nowv exist, the coins, whose intrinsic worth was uuidervalued in the ratio, gradu- I ally and surely disappeared from our circulation and went to other countries where their real value.was better -re cognized. Acts of congiess were im potent to cr-eate equality where natu ial causes decre .d even a slight ine quality. T wice in our recent history . we have signally failed to i-aise by legislation the value of silver. Under an act of congress passed in 1878 the government was required for more than twelve years to expend annually at least $24,00J0,000 in the purchase of silver bullion for coinage. The act of July 14. 1890, in a still bolder e ffort to1 increase the-amount of silver the gov ernment was conipelled.. to pu-chase and forced it to become the buyer an nually of 5L000.000 ounces, or practi cally the entire production of our mines. Under both laws silver rapid ly and steadily declined in value.
