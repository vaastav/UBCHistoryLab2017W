RAILROAD PROGRAM REN H PUS BULGAR ATTACK ONVA ARV With Serbian Armies in Retreat Into Albana and Montenegro, Bulk of German and Bulgarian Armies Are Being Concentrated Against the Al lied Armies In Southeast Serbia. PAWS. Dee. 8. Tho Fionch war office in its report this afternoon on hostilities in tho Orient (Sorbin) re cites the diiving back of a Bulgarian nttaok at Demirkapou, on the Vnrdar river, the nftornoon of December f. Tlio text of tho communication fol lows : "During tho afternoon of December 5 Bulgarian forces delivered a violent attack against our bridgehead at Demirkapou, on tho Vnrdar river. This nltack was completely repulsed. "Tho morning of December 0 wns (piiet along this entiro front." Illg llattlo llnglng LONDON, Dec. 8. With tho Serb inn armies in retreat behind tho Al banian and Montenegrin frontiers, it is reported the bulk of tho German nnd Bulgarian armies is being con centrated against tho allied armies holding tho southeast comer of Ser bia. Heavy fighting has been in progress thero for tho last few days. Thero is no confirmation of hints from various sources that tlio French troops have been forced definitely to nbandou tho positions held by them since tho beginning of tho campaign. Tho fnll of Monnstir and tho south ward progress of German nnd Bul garian forces, however, have placed tho northern wing of tho French ex pedition in a precarious situation, and withdrawal from tho angle formed by tho Vnrdar and Coma, rivers appar ently has begun. Constant arrival of fresh forces nnd war materials nt Saloniki give evidence that the allies have no in tention of abandoning their elforts in this region. Montenegrins Iteslst Although tho Germans huvo an nounced tho capture of Ipel;, Monte negro, tho pursuing Austrian and Bulgarian armies evidently nro con fronted with n harder tusk on the Montenegrin frontier than elsewhere. The Montenegrins continue to offer spirited resistance ami to check tho invaders wherever possible by sharp counter-attacks. In Albania tho Scihiuns who had been coniMdlcd to leave behind quan tities of war materials, appear incap able of organized icsistnnce. Even an orderly retreat is mndo difficult, us the Serbians are encumbered with largo numbers of civilians and pris oners. The latest dispntehes state that tho French nro bringing heavy guns into action in the Strumitsn region, cnus ing tho Bulgarians to retiro with heavy losses, A battle of lnrgc pro poitious between tho Bulgarian and Franco-British troops appears to be lauding.
