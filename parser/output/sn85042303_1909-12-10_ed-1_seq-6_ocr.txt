While the president I busy overhauling executive methods hand ed down by the Kooscv It roglnie. .Mrs. Taft Is devoting her?lf K the simplification of Hoclal custom In vegue under her predecessor !;t the white house. The changes In the social program that will be of special significance are those that will bu noted at the four official receptions to he given j al the white house in honor of the j diplomatic corps, the Judiciary, con-1 g:e s, and the army and navy. W1ilk' no official statement has , lii in made as yet, It Is understood I :liat the manner of public entertain- j ng by the president and Mrs. Taft , has been absolutely revolutionized. Tin- line, composed of the women of the cabinet and a feature of a white house reception from time Im memorial, has been abolished and the members of the cabinet and their fuuillicK will assist In the blue ioiiiii. To he asked to the blue loom or behind the line al a white house reception has been for a great number of years one of the most coveted of honors. Now all that will he done away with, no one will be InUtml there, and In consequence men and women piomlnent in offi cial r social life will be spared many a pang of Jealousy or denied many a throb of pride. Tlie president and Mrs. Taft will iccolve standing alone In the his toric blue room with .MaJ. Spencer Cosby or i'apt. Archibald Hutt In attendance. The receptions' will be shortened and the list of guests i urtalleil by several hundred.
