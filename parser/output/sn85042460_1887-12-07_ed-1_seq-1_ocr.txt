LOS ANGELES DAILY HERALD. VOL. XXIX. prior to Juno 30, 1887, the surplus revenue had grown so large by re peated accumulations, and it was feared that the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of tbe country, that the sum of *7h 8(14, --100 of such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and in terest of the 3 i>er cent, bonds still outstanding, and which wete then payable at the option of the govern ment. The precarious condition of financial affairs among the people still needing relief, immediately alter the 30th day of June, 1887, tho remainder of th" 3 iter cent, bonds then outstanding amounting with principal and interest to the sum of If 18,877,. r )00, wero called in and ap plied io tlie sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwith standing these operations of the Treas ury Department, REPRESENTATIONS OP DISTRESS fn business circles not only continued but increased and absolute peril seeiiiod at hand. In these circum stances the contribution to the sinking fund for th« current fiscal year was at once completed by tiie expenditure of $27,634,283.50 in the purchase oi gov ernment bonds not yet due, bearing four and four and a half per cent. Interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about 24 per cent, for the former aud 8 per cent, for the latter. In addition to this,! be interest account accruing during the current year Upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the Government, was to some ex tent anticipated, and bmks selected as deposi'orics of public money wero permitted to somew hat increase their deposits; but the expedients thus em ployed to release to tho people the money lying In the Treasury served only to avert Immediate danger, and our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting on the Ist day of December to $55,258,871.10. and is estimated to increase in the sum of $11,300 Or - ) by the 30th of June next, at which date it is ex pected that this sum, added to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus in the treasury to If 140,000.000. There seems to be no assurance that with such a withdrawal from use of the people's circilative medium, our business communities may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately pro duced from the same cause, and while the functions of our national treasury should be few and simple, and while its best condition would be reached. I believe, by its entire disconnection with private busi ness interests, yet when, by a perver sion of its purposes, it idly lulls money uselessly substraeted from the channels of trado, there seems to be 

REASON FOR THE CLAIMS That legitimate means should bo de vised by the government 11 restore, in the emergency, without waste or ex travagance, such money to its place among the people. If such an emer gency arses, there now exists no clear and undoubted executive power of re lief. Heretofore the redemption of the 8 per cents only, which wore, pay ablo at the option of the gov ernment, has afforded a means for the disbursement of the excess of our revenues; but these bonds have all been retired and there are no bonds outstanding, the ' payment of which wo have the right, to insist upon The contribution to the sink ing fund, which furnishes the occa sion for expendituresin tho purchase of bonds, has been made for the current year, so there is no outlet in that direction. Inthe present state of legislation the only pretense of any existing executive po*er to restore at this time any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its ex pen iture, consists in the suppo-ition that the Secretary of the Treasury may purchase tho bonds of the Govern ment not yet due. at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of la v Irom which such a power could be derived, is found in an ap TOpria tion bill passed a number of years age, and it is subject to the supposi tion that it was Intended as temporary and limited In its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to exist, which would justify the grant of power to a single official to upon his judgment of necessity, withhold from or release to the business of the peo ple in an unusual manner, money held in the Treasury, and thus affect, at his will, THE 

FINANCIAL SITUATION Of the Country; and if it is deemed wise to lodge In the Secret try of the Treasury the authority in the present juncture, to purchase bonds, it should , be plainly vested and provided, as far as possible, with such cheeks and limitations as will define b s official right and discretion, and at the same time relieve him from un due responsibility in con sidering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to eir e lit ion the surplus money accumu lating in the treasury. It, should be bo ne In mind that premiums must, of course, ho p-id upon such pur chase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which cannot be purchased at any price, and that coinhina ions among holders who are willing to sell may unreasonably enhanc. the cost of such bonds to tiie Goveri ment. It has been suggested that the present bond ed debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest and the ditferen. c between the old and new securities paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the treasury Tho suc cess of this plan, it is appar ent, must lie founded upon the volition of the holders of tho pres ent bonds, and it is not entirely certain that the inducement whicu must bo offered them would result in more financial benefit to the govern ment than the purchase of the bonds, while the latter proposil ion W< uld re duce ihe principal of the debt by ac tual payment instead of extending it. The proposition to deposit the money held by the government in banks th oughout the country for use by the people is, it seems to me, an exceed-. ingly objectionable principle, us | reaching too close a relationship be-| tween the operations of the govern ment to the busluesl of the country and the extensive commingling of its j money, thus fostering AN 

UNNATURAL RELIANCE In private business upon public i funds. If this scheme should j be adopted it should only be j done as a temporary expedient; to meet an urgent necessity. Legis-1 lative and executive effort should tenorally be in tho opposite direction, I THE MESSAGE. Matters of Grave Import. SURPLUS REVENUE. Dips from Its Accira latioD.

United States: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a con dition of the national finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful consideration. The amount of money annually received through the operation of the present laws from 'he industries and necessities of the people large'y exceeds the sum nece-sary to meet the expenses of "he Government, When we oon-i ler that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full endow ment of the fruits of his in dustry and enterprise with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the government w bich protects him, it is plain that tho exaction of more than this, is indefen sible and a culpable betrayal of fair ness and justice. This wrong indicted upon tho.-e who bear the burden oi national taxation, like other wrongs, mutiplies a breed of evil conse quences. The pub io treasury which should only exist as a conduit conve\ ing the people's tribute to its legitimate object of expenditure be comes a hoarding place for money, unlcsslv withdrawn from trado and tne people's use, thus crippling our national enerjies, usurping our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise-, threatening financial disturbance and inviting schemes of public plunder. This condition of our treasury is not altogether new, and it has more th in once of late been submitted tothe jteo ple's representatives in Congress which alone can supply a remedy. And yet the situation still continues with ag gravated incidents, more than ever presaging financial controls! >n and wide-spread disast r. It will not do to neglect this situation because its dangers are not now palpably immi nent, and apparent. They exist none the less certainly, though it is unfore seen, when suddenly they w ill he pre cipitated upon us. On the Moth day of Juno, 1885, THE

By the last census it is made to ap pear that of the 17.lift-' 0:19 of our population engaged in all kinds of lu du tries, 7,607,493 are employed in agriculture, and 4.074,238 in pro fessional and person..! sen ice 2,449, --876 of whom are d rnestie servants ami laborers, While 1,810 256 are em ployed in trade and transportation, ami 3.837,112 classed as em ployed at manufacturing aud min ing*. For the present purpo-ev leovever, the late number given -bond be considerably reduced, Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be conceded that-there should he deducted from tho-e which it in cludes 375 144 carpenters and joiners, '286.170 milliners, dressmakers an t seamsters, 172,120 blacksmiths, 133. --756 tailors and tailoresses, 107,0110 masons, 70.-41 butchers, 4l.o0.» bakers, 22,183 plasterers and 4SOI manufacturing agricultural imple ments, leaving 2,032.8113 persons etu pl ye lin manufacturing i dustries who are claimed to be benefited by a high tariif, ami to these the appeal i> nade, to save their employment and maintain their wages, by resisting a change. There should be no disposi tion to answer such suggestions by ih" allegations that, they a c in a in n .■?ity among those who labor, and iherefore should forego their advant ages in the interest of low prices for the maj iiity. Their compensation as it may be affected by 

OPERATIONS OF TARIFF LAWS Should at all times be scrupulously kept in view, and yet, with slight re flections, they will not overl M>k the fact that they are consumers with Ihe rest; that they, too. have their own wants and those of their families to -apply from their earnings, and that the prices of the necessaries of life, as *ell as the amount of those wants, will regulate the mea-uieof their wel fare and comfort. But the reduction of taxation demanded should be so meas ured as not to necessitate nor justify either the loss of employment by the workingman nor tbe lessening of his wages, and the profits still remaining to the manufactureis afier a ne' essary readjustment should furnish no ex cuse for their sacrifice of the interests of their employers in either their op portunity to work or the diminution of their compensation; nor can the worker in manufactures but under stand that w'.ile a high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow his remunerative payment, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly a!] sorts of manufac tures, which tn almost countless forms lie needs for the use of himself and his family, lie receives at the desk of his employer his wages, and per haps before he reaches his home is obliged in a purchase for family use of an article which in braces his own labor, to return in ihe payment of the increasing price Which, the tariff permits the hard ca ned compensation of many da\s of ioil. The farmer and the agricultu ralist, w ho manufactures nothing, hut who pays THE INCREASED PRICE which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural implement, upon all he wears and upon all he uses, and owns naught except the increase of his flocks and herds ami such things as his husbandry produces from the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining the present situation. Mind, he is told that a high duty on wool is necessary for the benefit of those w ho have sheep to shear m order that the pr cc of their wool may be increased. The- , of course, are not reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged in bis purchase of clothing and woolen goods to pay a tribute to his fellow-farmers as well as to the manufacturer and merchant, nor is any mention made of the fact that thu sheep-owners themselves and their h >v eholds wear cl thing and use other a tides manufactured horn the wool they sell tit tariff prices, and thus, us con«umers. must return their share of this Increased price t> (he tradesman, 1 think it may he faitly assumed that a lar*e proportion of the sheet" owned by the farmers throughout the country are found in small flocks numbering from 25 to 50. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is ten tents tor each pound of the value of thirty cents or le-s, and twelve rents If the value be more than thirty cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, Ine duty thereon would be 60 0 72 cents, and this may tie taken us the utmost enhancement of its price to the farmer by reason of this duly. Eighteen dollars would thus repre sent the increased price of the Wool from twenty-live sheep, and $86 that from thu wool of litty sheep, and at present values 1 his addition would amount to about one-third of its pi i. c. tf on its sale the farmer receives this or a less tarirf' profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all its changes w ill adhere lo it, until it reaches the consumer. When manufactured into cloth and other goods ami material for use, its Cost ia not only inrreased to the ex tent of the farmers' tariff profit, but A 

FURTHER SUM Has been added for the benefit of the manufacturer under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe himself ami family for tlie winter. When he faces tradesmen for that purpose be finds that he is obliged not only to re turn in the way of increased prices bis tariff profit on the wool he sold, and which then, perhaps, lies before him in manufactured form, but he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase In the cost, cause,i by the tariff duty on the man ufacture. Thus in the ond he is aroused to the hut that he has paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result of the tariff Bcheme which when be soi l bis wool.seemed so profitable, an Increase in price, more than suf ficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the num ber of fanners engaged in wool raising is compared with all the farm era in the country and tho small pro portion they bear to our population is considered, then it is made apparent that in tho case of a largo part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the and should have a tendency to divorce as much and its fast as it can safely bo done, the treasury depart ment from private enterprise. Of course it is not expected that unneces sary and extravagant operations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such expenditure, beside the demoralisation of sll just, com op tions of public duty which it entails, emulates a reckless improvidence not in the least consistent with the mission of our peoi le or tho high and beneficent purposes of our govern ment. I have deemed it my duty thu to bring to the knowledge of my coun trymen as well as to their representa tives, tho re-ponsihility of legislative relict and the gravity of tlie situation. The fadure nf Congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very NATURE OF TBE DIPPICOLTV Must necessarily produce, caused a condition of financial dis tress and apprehension sin c their last adjournment, which taxed to 11io utmost all the author ty and expedients under executive control, and tnese appear now to he exhaus ted, If disaster results from the con tinued inaction of Congress, tbe responsibility must res;, where it belongs.' Though tho situation thus far considered is frang t with danger which should be fully re allied, and though it presents features of wrong to the people as well as to the country, it is hut a result growing out of a perfectly palahlo and apparent cause.constantly ro| r slue ngtaeßin c alarming cireumsta' ces — a con gested National treasury and a de picted monetary condition of the busi ness of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situa tion demands a remedy, wo can only be saved from a predicament in the future by tho removal of the cause — our scheme of taxation—by means of which a needless s-urplns is taken from the people and put into the Treasury. It consists of the tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue, taxes levied upon the consumption of tobac o and spiritons liquors. It must be considered that none of these things subjected to internal revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, necessary, antl there appears to be no just cause of complaint by the consumers of the articles, and nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. Hut our present tariff laws, the various inequi table and illegal sources of 

UNNECESSARY TAXATION ought to be at once ie vised and amended. These laws as their pri mary and plain effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles impo ted and subjected to duty, by precise)) the sum paid for mien duties. Thu* the amount of the duty measures the ax paid by those who purchase for use these imported articles; many of these things, however, are laised oi manufactured in our country. The duties now placed upon foieign goods und products are called protective to our home manufacturers, because it is impossible for iho eof our people who are manufacturers to make these taxetl articles and sell them for a price equal to that dema ded for the imported goods yiitl ou customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the im ported articles, millions of our people who never use, antl never saw any o 1 the foreign products, pun base antl use things of the same k nd made in this country, and pay, therefore, near ly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports give the duty charged thereon to the public treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who bu domestic articles of the samo class pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty, to the home man ufactures. This reference to ihe operation of our tariif laws is not made by way of instruction, bat in or der that we m ty be constantly re minded of tho manner in which they IMPOSE A BURDEN Upon those who consume domestic products us well us tho.-e who con sume imported articles and thus cre ate a tax upon all onr people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the country of this taxation, it must be extensively continued as the source ol the Government's income., and in a readjustment of onr tariif tbe Interests of American labor engaged in manufacture should be cave fully considered, as well a~ the preservation of our manufactures. It may be called pr tectlo-i, or by any other name, bnt relief from the hard ships and dangers of our present t.n itflaws, should bo devised with es pecial precaution again-t imperiling the existence of our manufacturing in terests. But this exis once should not mean a condition which, without re gard to public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realisation of immense profits Instead of moderately profitable returns, As tiie volume and diversity of our national activities in crease, so do recruits to those who desire a continuation of the ad vantages which t ey conceive the present system of tariff taxation di rectly utf rds them. So stubbornly bate all efforts to reform the present condition bepn resisted by those o our fellow-ciiizens thus engaged, that they can hardly complain of the sus picion, entertained to a certain extent, that there exists an organized combi nation all along the line to maintain this system to their a I vantage. We are in the mid t of a centennial cele bration, and wi' h becoming pride we rejoice in American skill and inge nuity and American eoerny and en terprise, and the wonderful advan tages and resources developed by A 

CENTURY'S NATIONAL GROWTH, Yet w hen an attempt is made to justi fy a scheme which permits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in the land fur the benefit of our manufacturers quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it suits the pur poses of manufacturers and infant in dustries, still needing the highest and greatest degree of favor aud care that can be wrung from federal legislation. It is also said that the Increase in the price of domestic, inantt actures result ing from tho present tariffs is necessary in order that higher wages may be paid to our workiugmon employed in manufactories than are paid for what is called pauper labor. In all wn acknowledge the face of an argument which involves the welfare aud lilreral compensation o: our labor i ing people Labor is honorable in . the eyes of every Ametican citizen ami lies at the" foundation of our demned the condition of our laws which permit tlie collection from the people of unnecessary revenue aud have, in the most solemn manner, promised us correction; and neither as citizens nor partizans are our countrymen in a mood t> condone the deliberate violation of these pledges. Our progress to ward a wise conclusion will not be im proved by dw lhng on the topic of protection and free trade. Thissavors too much of bandying epithets; it is a condition which con ronts us, not a theory. Belief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home productions, but Ihe entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be con templated. THE 

QUESTION OP FREE TRADE Is absolutely irrelevant, and the per -istent claim made in certain quarters that all the efforts to relieve tho people from unju-t and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called freetraders is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the neces-ary expenses of an economical operation of the govern ment, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hol.l in the treasury through the per te sion of governmental powers These things can and should be, done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the opportunity for rev unerative labor which our work ingmen need, and with benefit to them and all our people hy cheapen ing their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their com foi ts.

FAVORABLE COMMENT. Opinions of the Lending London Papers. London, December 7. —The Morn ing Post, commenting on President Cleveland's message, says: "The message will produce a sensation in Europe as well as in America, ant -trengtben the free trade cause throughout the world." Ilie Daily News says: "Seldom has an American President had a in re important lesson to teach. The fact is, the policy ot protection has been redn ed to a practical and theo retioal absurdity. The stone now set rolling will not stop until tho idol of protection is broken in pieces." The Times says : "It is remarkable that Mr. Cleveland has tne courage to confront the serried phalanx of protectionists on the eve of a contest for the Presidency. As far as Eng land is concerned, it is questionable whether America will not eon rout us in formidable rivalry in bjth home and foreign markets " The Chronicle says: "If the policy of Piesident i leveland is accepted its effect on the trado of the world can not fail to be immense," The Standard says: "President Cleveland's message marks a revolu tionary s'arting point in the fiscal controversies of the United States." THE WAR UDPtaiMlfJi r. Report of the .secretary—Pacific Coast subjects. The annual report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the Department during the fiscal year o be $41,381,165. Estimdes for the next fiscal year aggregate $53,383,710, against an appropriation for the cur rent year of (31,065,802, the increase neing caused by the incorporation of estima es of $22,339,151. including river and harbor improve nents, the expenditu c on tbis account for the current year amounts to only $1,308, --409. The Secretary says that the es timates for a military establi-hment are based on the actual requirements of the service. During recent years the appro priation for the transposition of thi army has b en inadequate to meet the c >st t her of, an i tne failure t . ap propriate funds for that s rvicihas caused much embarrassment.

TnE 

INDIAN QUESTION. Touching Geronimo and his fellow captives, now confined at Fort Pick I present tariff on wool is illuso'y, and above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of tho cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a bur den upon those with moderate means, and the poor, tb-employed and un employed, the sick and well, antl the voting and old, und that it const,tuted a tax which 

WITH RELENTLESS GRASP Is fastened upon the clothing of evert mau, Woman ami child in the land, reasons are suggested why the re moval or reduction of thisduty should not he included in a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of tbe in creased cost to the consumer of our home manufactures, resulting from a duty laid upon impor ed articles of the same description, the fact is not over looked that competition among our domestic producers sometimes has tbe effect of keeping the price of out products below the highest, limit al lowed by such duty. But it is notorious that this competition i* too often strangled hy combinations quite prevalent, at tbis time and fre quently called trusts, which have foi their object the regulation of the sup ply and price of commodities mad< and sold hy members of the combina tion. The people can hardly liO| c for any consideration in the operati m of these Selfish schemes. If, how eve ,in the absence ol such a combi nation a healthy and free coini c it.oti reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home production below the 1 luit which it misfit other wise rea. h und r our tariif laws, and if with such reduced price its manu facture continues to thrive, it i entirely evident that one thing has heetl discovered which should lie care fully scrutinized in an effort, to reduce tax .tion. The necessity of combine tion to maintain the price of any com modity to the tariff point, furnishes pi oof that some one is willing to ac e« pt lower prices for such commodity and that such prices are remunera tive, and the latter prices are producetl hy comi ctition prove the same thing. Thus, where citlierof these conditions exist, a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduction of tixttion. The considerations which have been presented touching onrtur fT laws are inteuded only to enforce AN EARNEST RECOMMENDATION That the surplus reteuues of the Gov ernment lie prevented, by the reduc tion of our customs duties an 1 at the same t me to einphas ze the sugges tion that in accomplishing this pur pose we may discharge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters wtv re it is most needo I ttod from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded Nor can the presentation made of such consideration be with any degree of fairness regarded as evidence of un friendliness toward our manufacturing interests or any lack of appreciation of their value and importance. These interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our national greatness and furnish tbe proof of oui country's progress. If in the emer gency that presses upon us our manu facturers are asked to surrender some thing for Iho public good and to ii". rt disa.-ter, their patriotism, as well as a grateful recognition of th- advantages already afforded, should lead them to bo willingly Co-operative. No demand is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental regard, but they cannot want to be admonished of their duty aB well as their enlight ened self - interest anil sai ty, when they are reminded of the fa t that the financial panic and collapse to whi. h the present condition tends, affords no greater shelter or protection to onr manufactures than to our other Important enterprises. An opportu nity for a safe, careful and deliberate reform is now offered, and none of us should be unmindful of a time w hen an sbu-edatid irritated people, hee l less of tho-e who have resi-ted timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs. The difficulty attending A 

WISE AND FAIR REVISION Of our turiir laws is not under-esti mated. It will require, on the part of Congress, great labor and care, and especially a broad and national con templation of the subject, and a patriotic disregard of such local and selfish claims as are unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of the entile country. Under our present laws more th in four thousand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures, and many aro hardly worth att nt ion as subjects of revenue A considerable reduction can be made in the aggregate by adding thetu to the fie i list. Ibe taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship, but the necessities of life used and con sumed by all the people, thedulv upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, shout i he greatly cheapened. The radical reduction ol the dutie imposed upon raw material used in manufacture, or its free importation is oi course an important factor in any effort to reduce the prices of these necessaries. It would not only re lieve them from the increased cost caused hy the tariff on such material hut tho manufactured product being cheapened, that part of the tariff now laid upon such product as a com peusa tion lo our manufacturers, for the price of raw material coull be accord ingly mollified, und such reduction ot free importation would serve, besides, to largely 

REDUCE THE RBVENUE. It is not appare t how such a change can have any injurious effects upon our manufacturers, on the contrary, it would appear to give them a better chance in foreign markets with the manufacturers of other countries, wtio cheapen their wares by free material and thus our people might have the opportunity of extending their sales beyond the limits of home consump tion, saving them from tlie depres i iv of Interruption lv business and loss caused by a glutted dome-tic market, and alfonlirig their employes more certain and st- ady labor, with its re- BUltlng quiet, and contentment. The question thus imperatively pre sented for solution should be approached in a spirit higher than partisanship, and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those entrusted with tho weal of a confiding people aud tho obligation to declared party |»olicy, and principle should not interfere with prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represented in tho Government have by repeated nud unauthoritative declarations con i\ T O. 66 ens and Mount Vernon Barracks, the report says (hit up to this time it haa been a difficult matter to find for them a permanent home.
