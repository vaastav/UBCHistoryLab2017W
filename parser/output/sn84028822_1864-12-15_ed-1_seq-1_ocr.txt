While our political relations with that country have undergone no change, wo have at the same . time strictly maintained neutrality between , the beligcrents. . 

SOUTH AMERICAN RELATIONS. At tbn rrnnnst of tboStutns f (!nsi,i 111 and Nicaragua, n competent engineer has been authoVized to make a survey of the river San Juan and the Port of San .Juan. It is ii source of much satisfaction, that the ' difficulties which for iimoincnt excited i-onio political apprelioiiMonsand caused a closing! of the inter-Oceanie transit route, havobecn ' amicably a.usted, and that thdro is a good ' . . ; !.. .1... ...:n o i ....., i.

The new liberal Constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with tho univer.-al acquios- cenee of the pcoide, the Uovcrinncnt under it has been re-organi.ed, and diplomatic intercour.-c witli it has been n cordial and spirit. The long deferred Avis Island claim lias wen satisfactorily paid and discharged. Mutual payments' have been made of the claims awarded by the lato joint commission for tho settlement of claims be- twden the United Stales and l'eru. An earnest and cordial fiiendship continues to exist between tho two countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain. Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chili, tho Argentine Jtepublic, Bolivia, Costa Kica. San Salvador and Ilavti. Dur- ing tho past year no differences of any kind i . . . i .i n. -.i i' . nave arisen iin any in inusu ltcpuinics, and on tlio other Hand tl.c.r symni jr hand their sympathies with the united States arc constantly expressed.

Such vessel is needed for thosafety of that State against the native African races, and in Li beriaft hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave-trade than a squadron in ourowii hands. The possession of the last organized naval force would stim ulate a generous ambition in tho republic, and tlio confideneo which wo should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor towards the colony from all civilized nations. Official enrresnondeneo has been freeU- opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleas- nig view of the social and political progress in that republic. It may bo expected to derive new vigor from American influences, improved by the ramd disappearance of slavery in the United States, i solicit your authority to furnish to that republic a nun- INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH. Tho proposed Overland Telegraph be tween America and Europe, by the way of Hehring's Straits and Asiatic Russia which! was sanctioned by Congress at the last ses-l sion, lias Dcen undertaken under very lav-1 orablo' circunistaiices by an association of American citizens with tho cordial good will and support, as well of this Government as those of Great Britain and Russia. Assur ances have boon received from, most of the South American States of their high appre ciation of tho enterprise, and thcirreauiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world encircling communication. Ilearn with much satisfaction that the noblo design of a telegraphic communication between thc eastern coast of America and Great liritaiu has been renewed with a full expectation of its early accomplishment Thus it is hoped that with tho return of do mestic peace, tho country will be able to re sume with energy and advantage her former nigii career oi commerce aim civilization. EGYPT. Our vcry popular and estimable represen tative in Lcypt died in April last. An un pleasant altercation which arose between tho temporary incumbent of the oflico and tho Government of tho Pacha, resulted in a suspension of intercourse. Tho evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of tho suc cossor to the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Uarbary Powers, aro entirely satisfactory. CHINA. The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China, has at Just been sup pressed, with tho co-operating good offices of this Government, and of tho other Wes tern Commercial Powers. The judical con sular establishment has becomo very difficult and oncious, and it will need legislative ac tion to adapt it to tho extension of our com merce, nnd to the more intimate intercourse which has boon instituted with thc Govern ment and thc pcoplo of (hat vast empire. China seems to bo accepting,' with hearty good will, the conventional laws which regu late 'commerce and social intercourse among the Western nations. JAPAN. Owing to and tho anomalous form of Government, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and ciipri- tious. Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the Western Powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecu niary claims have been allowed or put in courso of settlement, and tho Inland Sea has been ro-opened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceeding; have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan toward the United States, BLOCKADE RAISED. The ports of Norfold, Fernandina and Pensacolii, have been opened by Proclama tion. It is hoped that Foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and moro profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, lo resort to these and other opeu ports than itis to pursue through many hazard and at .vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which aro closed, if not.b actual military operations, at least by 'a lawful and effectivo blockade. THE SLAVE TRADE. For nivsolf T have no doubt of tho nower and duty of tho Executive, under tho law of nations iu uxciuuo cnoinies ui uiu nuiiiaii race from as asylum in tho United States. If Congress should think that tho proceed ings in such cases lack tho authority of law, or ought to bo farther repudiated by it, I recommend that provision lw made effcolu- ally irovciitiiiy foreign slave traders from1 ucqurriiig ilouiicilo ntid facilities for their eritninal occupation in our country.

FINANCES. government have been successfully administered during tho past year. The legislation of tho last session qf Congress has beneficially affected the revenue, although sullicicnttitno has not yet elapsed to experience tho full effect of several ol the provisions ot tlio Acts ot Con gress imposing increased taxation. Tho re ceipts during the year faom all sources, upon tho basis of warrants signed by thoSecretary of the IVeasur.y, includinc the loans and the balance in the .treasury on the lirst day ot July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three were $l,o98,7'.Mi,OU7 (12, and tho aggregate dis bursements upon the same basis, were $1,- 2!H,0fi(i,10l b'.i, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as showd by warrants, of $00, 7.ii,'J0 ";. Deduct from these amounts tho amount of the principal of the Publio Debt redeemed anil the amount ol issues m substitutes therefor, and the actual cash operations of tho Treasury were: Receipts $891,070,04(5 77; Disbursements, SSli.'i, 2;!4,0S7 80, which leaves a cash balance ill tho Treasury of $18,842,558 71.

For the actual receipts and disbursements for tho first quarter and tho estimated receipts and disbursementsfor tho three remaining quar ters of tho current fiscal year and the general operations of tho Treasury iu dotail, I refer vou to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I concur with him in tho opinion that; the proportion of tho monies required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation, should be still furth er increased, und I earnestly invite your at tention to this subject, to tho end that there mav bo such additional Legislation as shall bo required to meet tho just expectations of tho secretary, POPULAR LOANS. Tho public debt on tho first day of July last, as appears by the books of tho Treas ury, amounted to ono billion, seven hund red and forty thousand millions, six hund red and ninety thousand, four hundred and eighty-nine dollars and lorly-nino cents. Probably should the wur continuo for anoth er year, that amount may bo incrersed, by not far froni fivo hundred millions. Held, as it is for the most part by our own people, it has bcconio a substantialbranch of nation al, though private property. For obvious reasons, tho moro nearly this property can bo distributed among all tho people tho bet ter, to favor such general distribution, greater inducements to becomo owners, might perhaps, with goodefTcctand without injury, bo presented o persons of limited means. With this view I suggest whether it might not bo both expedient and compe tent for Congress to provide that a limited amount of souio future issue of publio secu rities might bo hold by any bonafido purch ase, exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limita tions as might bo necessary to guard against tho nbuso of so important a privilege This would enable prudent persons, toEct.asido a 1 small annuity against n pnssibloday of want. Privileges like theso would render the ' possession of such securities to tlio ninount limited, most desirable to persons of small ,..1 l. !.!,. ... 1.1:.. miu.iii-, v uti niillt iJ iii'j'- to "in : i;iiuiikii i !(.

' with relation to tho public debt is obvious. Men readily perceive that th"y cannot be much oppressed by a debt width they owe to themselves. The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceed ing the estimate of the Secretary of tho Treasury, made to Congress at the com liicnccmotit of tho last session, fell short of hci estimate of that officer, mads in the pre ceding December, as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year, by the sum S3,90.",O7y,B.'J. This fact cxhil.its a satis factory condition and conduct of the opera tions of tho Treasury. NATIONAL BANKS. The National Banking system is proving to bo acceptable to capitalists and to the people. On the 15th of November li e hun dred and eighty-four National Banks had been organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from State Banks. Changes from tho State system to the Na tional system, arc rapidly taking place, and it is hoped, that very soon, there will lie iu i. f..:.i a. ....... .... i i. ,.c .... authorized bv Conui-ess. and no bank note . circulation not secured by the Government.

It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population, improvement and Governmental institutions over tho now and unoccupied portion of our country, have scarcely been impeded, much less checked or destroyed by our great civil war, which at the first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of tho nation. TERRITORIES. The organization and admission of thc State of Nevada has been completed in con formity with the law. and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountai ns which once seemed a barren and uninhabit able wasto between tho Atlantic States and thoso which havo grown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The territories of tho United States arc generally in a condition of prospciity and rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance, and the inter ruption of communication with them by In dian hostilities, have been only partially or ganized, but it is understood that these dif ficulties aro about to disappear, which will permit their governments, liko thoso of others, to go into speedy and full operation as intimately connected with and promoting of this material growth of tho nation. PACIFIC RAILWAY. I ask tho attention of Congress to the valuablo information and important recom mendations relating to the public lauds and the Indian affair., and Pacific Railroad's mineral discoveries, contained in the report of tho Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics of publio interest pertain iiif to bis department.
