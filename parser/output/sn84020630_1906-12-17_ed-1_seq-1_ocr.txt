Complaints charging 'two of the male teachers In the public schools of New Mexico with drunkenness, were filed With, the Territorial Board of Education and were acted aipon at the meeting of that body Saturday. One of the complaints was against Alex ander Adamson of Taos, Taos Coun ty, and the other against iFeliz Ortego, of Farmlngtoln, Rio Arriba County, Adamson's territorial teacher's certifi cate was revoked and Superintendent of 'Public Instruction Hiram Hadley was ordered to Investigate the charge against Ortego. Adamson was served with a notice of the complaint that had been filed against him, and notified the superin tendent of public instruction that he would appear in person to answer the charge. He did not present himself at the appointed time, although known to have arrived in the city. An ef fort was made to find him to permit liim to refute the charge if he could. When he did not appear up to a few minutes previous to adjournment a motion was unanimously adopted re voking his teacher's license. As Ortego had not been advised of the complaint filed against him the superintendent of public Instruction was authorized to make a personal Investigation and was empowered to use his own judgment in the matter. After weighing the evidence, If he concluded that Ortego was guilty as charged he was instructed to issue an order revoking his teacher's certifi cate also. The Territorial Hoard of Education sustained the action of the county su perintendent and superintendent of public instruction in the matter of H. C. Harper of Lincoln County. Harper failed to attend the teachers' institute last year In Lincoln County. He ren dered an excuse which was not deemed sufficient by the county super intendent, and the superintendent of public instruction concurred in this opinion. Harper appealed his case to the board with the result that the former action was sustained unani mously. In speaking about the proposed re visions of the school laws Professor Hadley said this morning: "It was the general opinion of those present that the present manner of ixamining teachers is unsatisfactory and unnecessarily expensive. Sev eral other points of the law were, dis cussed. It was believed that the pow ers and duties of the Territorial Board of Education could be enlarged to the benefit of the schools. "We believe that the selection of the county superintendents should be utkeiuout of politics or the school In terests of the Territory will continue to suffer us long as the present sys tem prevails and the funds for educa tional purposes wasted. It was the sentiment at the meeting that the of fice of county superintendent should be made appointive." Territorial teacher's certificates were granted to the following teach ers: Mrs. Dora C. Fletcher, Santa Fe, life certificate. Miss Lottie Sweet, Las Cruces, life certificate. Miss Helen Higgason of Alamo ;ordo, five years' certificate. Miss Clara Herhardt of Sunnyslde, 3ve years' certificate. Miss Blanche Twohig of Colorado Springs, five years' certificate. Miss Twohig's certificate is made conditional upon her furnishing evi dence that she has taught In the pub 'lc schools of New Mexico. Management of New York Life and Mutual.

Aside from examining the books c' county officials, which he found t:. balance to a cent and in perfect con dition, Mr. Safford Installed new bond and coupon registers in all the coun ties visited. These registers are books not unlike in size and general appearance the official tax books' and I will prove of great convenience in recording bonds and coupons covering the bonded Indebtedness. The simple arrangement of the register is one that can not help but appeal to all who examine them. Blank spaces are left for all of the informatiqn desired such as the style of bonds and cou pons, rate of Interest charged, time and options allowed, date when due and date when paid. Increase in Business Adds to Work "I found it slow work in checking up on account of the increased busi ness. All of the counties visited are In the best of financial condition, Prospects are good for heavy collec tions for this month and the first of the year. Installing and explaining the use of the new bond and coupon registers also took considerable time. "The Pecos Valley is prosperous in every re-pect and hat section of the country is filling up fast with new set tiers. Colfax County Forging Ahead.- "Colfax County is probably going ahead in substantial growth as fast as any of those In the Pecos Valley. The St, Louis, Rocky Mountain & Pa cific Railroad is now operating daily trains between Raton and Cimarron.

United States mine inspec tor for New Mexico, who says that only 1,500,000 acres of land have been sufficiently Investigated to show that they contain coal deposits. A total of 04,193,.1(1( acres of . coal land has been withdrawn from entry In eight Western states and territories, accord ing to Ihe commissioner's report. included In this aggregate are 5,6-44.-000 ucres in Utah, 13,085,000 acres in Colorado. 1,105.000 acres in Oregon.

Bacon Seeks His Employer, l'.d the man who started a colony in Uio Arriba County ten .miles from llnlllwis near (lallliias River, abscond with the funds on hand, leaving twen ty-six disconsolate settlers from Farm Ington and Duruugo holding down the land'.' This is the question V. S. Bacon o' Durango, Colorado, would like to have answered. He arrived Jn Santa Fj Saturday to make Inquiries about the promoter and left this morning via the Denver & Rio Grande for Kspa- nola. from where he will drive to the site of the colony. Mr. Union In telling of the case said: "I do not say that the man is dis honest and I am ihe last person to think ill of biiiii, but the settlers on tln land mis becoming uneasy lo calise we are unable to find him. "I am not. one of the settlers in tli? new colony but I whs employed in a variety ,f capacities by the man pro moting the project and I want, to he able to return to the colony and tell the sol Hers all that it Is possible to learn about the gentleman's where abouts, What I have been able to learn here, does not throw much light en the subject. As nearly as I can ascertain Ihe promoter of this colony, after .making several trips lo the land in question, secured a party of set 'Hers and took them lo the land. They were lo take ll up In 100 acre 'tracts under the homestead law. In addition I understand, that most of them gave the promoter $1 On apiece, with which he was to make the improvements, such as building houses, fences, cor rals, etc. I understand also that there was to have been an Irrigation pro ject of some kind. The great attrac tion, however, was the nelier mat. a railroad, to be built by the Denver & Rio Grande or some other line, would run through the colony. Be fore the entries on t:he land were made, however, we heard that the tract where the colony was located, had been a.lded to the Jemez Forest Reserve. This created some uneasi ness and the promoter of the project left for Santa Fe to see Forest Su pervisor Leon F. Kneipp. 'He reached here Thursday, for about. 5 o'clock that afternoon he filed a message to nie at tne western Union office in the Capital. I re ceived the message Friday morning. Since that time I have heard nothing from the man. He did not register at the hotels, here as nearly as I can ascertain. He gave me an address of his sister In San Diego. California, were he said he formerly lived, but when I sent a message there, it was returned for a better address. "Besides the settlers at the colony are some thirty head of horses and r'.gs from the Allen livery stables at Farmington. I presume, I shall re turn them to the owner In a few days if the promoter is not heard from. My trip here has been fruitless as I have not been able to learn anything definite, except that, he came to this city. "I will go to G-alliuas and tell the colonists what I know and they can then do as they see fit." At the forest supervisor's office in the Federal building, it was said that nothing had been heard of the pro jected colony but that the fact that the land had been added to the forest reserve did not. prevent its being set tled 'iipon if the tract in question was suitable for agriculture.

GRAVE CHARGES EX- PLAINSSHORTAGE In Coal Lack of Cars Not Re sponsible. MANY lilo (UK Says President Elliott of the Northern Pacific In creased Consumption Washington. Dec, 17. In response to telegrams addressed to several western railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the cauw of the reported shortage of cars for the transportation of fuel by reas on of which severe suffering was en tailed, President Howard Klllott of the Northern Pacific Railroad tele graphs to the commission from St. Paul that while there Is a shortage of coal in some parts of the country his line did not know of any shortage of other necessities of life. Did not Think Railroads Respon sible. He did not think the cause was an extraordinary delay In the moving of coal as alleged, but was rather due to an increased domestic irade so that in Montana and Idaho not enough coal was mined to supply this increase. What Caused Shortage in Northwest. In North Dakota and Minnesota he said the difficulty was partly due to trying to move too much coal in a very short time ajid partly to the in creased consumption of fuel which is greater than the facilities for hauling. moving and storing. The severe weather in North Dakota also aided In causing the delay. No Relief in Coal Famine of North Dakota. Linton, N. D Dec. 17.
