President Wilson in his last annual message to congress made some suggestions that will re ceive the unanimous approval of nearly every one regarding the simplification of revenue and profit taxes. It is one of the greatest objections to the federal tax laws that no one can be cer tain of what they mean, or how much he owes the government. It is useless to consult an at torney who is supposed to be an expert in inter preting the meaning of legislative enactments. Most of our best lawyers will frankly tell their clients that they do not know how to interpret them. Some refuse to give advice on this sub ject. We are reliably informed that the internal revenue department at W ashington charged with the collection of these taxes could not un derstand them and after calling in various ex perts who differed with each other as to what the law meant in its practical application, just went ahead themselves in making decisions that are of the hit or miss order. The ordinary bus iness man has pursued the same policy. It is up to him to contstrue the meaning of any law. Utterly confused after he had read two separate and conflicting income tax laws and an excess profits tax law, he has quite often turned the whole mess over to his chief clerk or bookkeeper with instructions to fill out the blanks to the best of his ability and make the tax returns he has to swear to, and the clerk who admits his inability to understand it either, and can get little help from legal counsel, goes ahead and does the best he can. There must be an awful mess to untangle at Washington now in these tax returns. Business men in these parts are getting requests from Washington for more in formation and details about tax returns for 1917, which would seem to indicate that the government itself is several years behind in its examination of these tax returns. The requests receiving often call for weeks of work of a cleri cal nature going through old books. As no pos sible use or utility can be perceived for much of the information called for by the taxpayer, and it involves great additional expense in clerk hire to him, it is a further source of irritation to him. j In his message to the regular session of con gress, on December 2, the president said : "I trust that the congress will give its immedi ate consideration to the problem of future taxa tion. Simplification of the income tax and profit taxes has become an immediate necessity. These j taxes performed an indispensable service dur ing the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense, but in order that his liability may be made more certain and definite. "With reference to the details of the revenue law, the secretary of the treasury and the com missioner of internal revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments ne cessary or desirable in connection with the ad ministration of the law—recommendations which have my approval and support. It is of the utmost importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920, payable in the calendar year 1921. The congress might well consider whether the high er rates of income and profit taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue, and whether they may not, on the contrary, be de structive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profit taxes discourage energy, remove the in centive to new enterprise, encourage extrava gant expenditures and produce industrial stag nation with consequent unemployment and oth er attendant evils." The statements made by the president with regard to the present federal tax laws are un doubtedly true. He made similar recommenda tions at the beginning of the special session last May, but congress ignored them and did nothing They were too busy making campaign thunder and investigating everything under the sun but their own duty to their constituents. We note that the president says that it is important that the present law should not be disturbed so far as taxes for the calendar year 1920 are con cerned. We do not know just why that is so, but the president has little cause for alarm over such possibility. At the rate congress moves in such matters it is liable to be more than a year before they can agree on any changes. The laws they have passed are such marvels of com plex imbecility that we doubt if they could pos sibly make them worse by any amendments whatever, even if they tried their best. Perhaps the president fears their present complexity must be that. Otherwise we would think they by the present congress that he wants to wait for a new congress to be elected before they un dertake the task of straightening them out. It would be so further increased by amendments could not be amended too soon. So far as re ducing the taxes collected are concerned that appears to be hopeless for another year, for the government not only needs all the taxes it now put more too, in order to meet the extravagant appropriations of the present congress. The president says, however, that congress j j might as well consider whether present taxes are so high as to reduce revenue received under them. Congress will do nothing of the kind we predict. It will consider only the effect in votes in the coming election of its fiscal policies, and nothing else, until after the next election. 

APOLOGIES DUE MISS ADDAMS. It will be recalled that during the Ford libel suit against The Chicago Tribune one of the li belous statements made was that he had said every soldier in the late war should have the word "murderer" embroidered on his tunic or words to that effect. In justification of the li bel a Chicago Tribune reporter who had quoted Mr. Ford as expressing that sentiment, admitted that Mr. Ford did not use those words, but the reporter called his attention to the alleged fact that Miss Addams had used them, and Mr. Ford had indorsed Miss Addams and as he understood him justify her in all her utterances including this abominable libel on our soldiers. The press of the country generally, including this news paper, reported the alleged explanation of the Chicago Tribune reporter and of course with the assumption that she had made such statement. It was well known that she had held extremely radical views on the subject of war generally, and she was one of the leading spirits in the sending of the famous and very ridiculous peace ship to Europe to stop the war and "get the sol diers out of the trenches before Christmas" in the opening years of the war. It took nearly five years of bloody fighting and the destruc tion of a large percent of the wealth of the world to do that and the "peace expedition" made itself ridiculous and Henry Ford, who fi nanced it, ridiculous also, when it developed in to a sort of crank bedlam grafting the millions of its patron, and breaking up in a row among themselves over leadership and the distribution of the funds Mr. Ford furnished, among them selves. After all these years Miss Addams came for ward and denies that she ever used any such expression as was put in her mouth by the re porter, or even saw him at the time when he alleged he interviewed her. It seems to us that Miss Addams is entitled to some publicity for her belated denial inasmuch as the alleged quo tation from her was given a great deal of pub licity all over the country. The Chicago Trib une which originally gave currency to the state ment and at first attributed it to Mr. Ford, sets the example by publishing Miss Addams' denial as follows: "The letter Miss Addams has sent to the Tri bune is a copy of one she wrote on October 20 to a Mr. Van Allen, Boston clergyman who had asked her whether she had used the phrase "murderer embroidered upon the breast of every I soldier." Miss Addams said to Mr. Van Allen: "You will doubtless recall that statement was i made in the Ford trial by one named Edward Marshall, who had repeated it to Mr. Ford. : When asked for his authority Mr. Marshall, who is a newspaperman, said that I had made the statement in an interview granted him in the I presence of Norman Hapgood. "I never saw Mr. Marshall but once, when I gave him an interview in New York. At the time he made the statement I was abroad. Nor man Hapgood, who is, as you know, minister to Denmark, was, of course, also abroad, and there was nothing left except Mr. Marshall's unsup ported statement. The attorney promptly challenged Mr. Marshall's words and in an inter view later he said that I had made the state ment only in regard to German soldiers. Fe thus carefully qualified the statement for his own protection. "The whole incident was so obviously an at tempt to catch Mr. Ford that it did not occur to me that it would be taken seriously. I have spoken in public and written my views so cons tantly that is strange my opinion should have to be set forth by a newspaperman who had seen me but once and was totally unable to cor roborate the statement he made. "Since, however, Miss Hamilton has written me that you did take the statement seriously may I hasten to assure you quite categorically that I have never used those words nor said anything that could even remotely be so con strued. May I quote from page 235 of my book, 'Newer Ideal of Peace' published by MacMillan & Co., in 1907. It is the only reference I can find anywhere in my writings as to the motive of the soldier: " 'We may at last comprehend the truth of that which Ruskin has stated so many times, that we worship the soldier,not because he goes forth to slay, but to be slain.' "I shall be very glad to send a copy of this statement to the Boston Transcript or the Stfringiield Republican, two of the very few pa pers that printed the statement. Even the Chi cago papers dismissed it as flimsy evidence." Miss Addams is mistaken in saying that very few newspapers printed the statement, though our recollection is that none of them except the Chicago Tribune printed it, except as reporting the evidence in the Ford libel case. But we are glad to give what added publicity we can to her denial, because Miss Addams, though very rad ical in her views on many subjects was a great and good woman and gave good service to her country in her humanitarian work in Hull House. a i HASKIN LETTER By FREDERIC J. HASKIN COAL AND CHAOS Washingtono, I). C., Dec. 12.—Whom you choose to blame for the fact that you have just been threatened with all the horrors of coal famine is largely a matter of polities and point of view. But one conclusion you cannot avoid if you look fairly at facts. Our failure to get adequate and continuous supply of coal is due largely to the fact that our great industrial systems, of which we boast so much, is poorly and even stu pidly organized. And for this we are all to blame. Until the last few years the ultimate consumer has been chiefly interested in the price of coal. He has been able to get coal by paying the price. He has been led to believe that this price repre sents an undue profit for somebody. Mr. McAdoo says the operators have been getting it, and the operators retort, "Search us!" But recently the all important ques tion of what price we pay for coal was eclipsed by the still more important question of whether we were going to get any coal at all. We have 46 per cent of all the coal in the world—enough of it to last us several centuries. There are enough wqrkmen in the country to dig it. And yet we have been threat ened with freezing both this winter and last. This state of affairs suggests that something is wrong with the way we go about digging and distributing our coal. Investigations which have been made re cently by government experts strongly support this suggestion. There is some thing wrong with our coal production system. And the settlement of the strike will not by any means remedy that trouble. A lack of intelligent co operation between operators, the mine ers, the railroads, and the consumer is at the bottom of the problem, accord ing to the best expert evidence available. Let us start with the public. The public, including both domestic consum ers and factory owners, has been ac customed to buy its coal when it. needs it, which is in the winter. The result is that we must have enough mines and enough miners on the job to supply that maximum winter demand. It ................ f°l" lows inevitably thai in the spring and summer, when the demand is lax, mines and miners are idle. They are in fact idle from one-fourth to one-third of tii»' time. This is one of the thine* that the miners are kicking about. They want to be assured of five days of work a week, at least. Some of the dear pub lie still think that the miners want to As a work five days a week at most. matter of fact the miners want to work more not less. It is discouraging to go to work in the morning and to be told that there will be no work that day, and no pav, because tlier»> is no market for the product. Yet that is what the min ers are told again and again. In some of the Ohio mines, the miners were given only about 200 days of work last i year. In New Mexico they worked over 300. In most places they" worked about °50 days ~ So the' miners are idle in the spring and summer for luck of a market, and when the winter rush comes along, they are idle part of the time for lack of «-ars to handle the coal. It is quite evident that if Uip spring and summer market could be stimulated, the miners cotrld be kept busy thf-n. and the winter rush could to some extent be forestalled. There would then be more cars avaiLiole A SAFE DEMOCRACY! Copvrlght, 1919. by The Press Publishing Co. (The New York Evening World.) By J. H. Cassel : kas t ,v: -<■ < • s: -rän 4?

The miners would have continu ous work and we could have a continuous coal supply. The present state of affairs has often been blamed on the operators. It has been stated that they should provide storage facilities for coal at the mines. Then coal mined in the warm weather could be stored until needed. But the technical investigations made by the Bu reau of Mines does not bear out the theory that the operators are to blame. They show that the storage of coal at the mine is attended with serious diffi culties. Soft coal stored in large quan tities—many thousand tons—is in dan ger from spontaneous combustion. That is, it may take fire from the heat which is generated by oxidation. And again, storing coal at the mines means handl ing it twice instead of once, as is done if the coal is put directly into cars. This means an extra cost to be passed on to the consumer. And he is bearing enough extra costs now! It also means that the coal will be brdken up, and will thus decrease in val ue. Coal loses value from this cause every time it is handled. The logical place to store coal, there fore, is in the bin of the consumer, and ior «i, is m uie um 01 iue cuuoumer, aim not at the mine. The small supply used j by the domestic consumer (meaning you ! and I» is in no danger from spontaneous combustion, and the amounts needed by the average factory are not in such danger either if properly stored. There fore, the consumer «'„^-ild buy his coal in the spring and summer as much as possible, and store it. But we already had done so much en i grounds of patriotism that we did not f* , , 1 . . x» » heed the appeal to any great extent. .Now During the war we were all urged to : do this on the grounds of patriotism, „reu U,* «„,»«» tu any ! Director Manning of the Bureau of Mines ! comes forward with a more practicable j suggestion. He suggests that the coal i be made cheaper to the consumer in the ; summer than in the winter. Here is a method we can all appreciate. | Owing to the laws passed by congress | against price-fixing agreements, the op- i erators of coal mines cannot agree to j ! set a lower price in the warm weather. : But Director Manning makes the inter- ! j eating suggestion that the same result j would be attained if the government would work out a sliding scale of trans- I j portation charges for the carrying of coal j j by the railroads and boats, which would j make coal cheaper in the summer. It is ; j easy to see how this would work with-j ; out going into details. i oal perhaps j would bp hauled most cheaply In July, I \ because there is theu less demand tor ; it. Bv buying your coal in July you might save a dollar a ton. In January ; j it would be most expensive The Jan ; uary price would be enough above the ; July price to make up the loss. By j varying the scale of transportation ; charges, the production of coal could, theoretically and, it would seem, prac- ; tically, be controlled almost at will. There are several ways in which the j production of coal could be regulated. ; ! One of the best ways would be to have power plants at the mines, and so to i convert the eoal_ immediately jnto heat and power, which are much cheaper to ,-arry than coal. I his would be the log ; ical way, but it is of course not a way that can be put into effect on short no , tice. . • Another way, also pointed out by Di ; rector Manning, and of immediate value, 1 »"
