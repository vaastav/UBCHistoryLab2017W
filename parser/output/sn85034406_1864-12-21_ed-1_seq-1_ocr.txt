Let'tho blood of the nation How out Like a river to vanquish its foe, Let each father and brother turn out, (But the doctor says I cannot gol) Aucnrfnent of the Coittftrtpifon The Urbana Union is convinced that "an early and sw eping draft is enevitable." It therefore favors the amendment of tho con scripticm Jaw so as to require all drafted men togointo the army, "unless exempted for physical disability, , or for some specified reason of public policy. " It spucifies three advantages that would result from such re quirement, chief among which is: "In the words of Gen. Sherman, in his letter to the Massachusetts Substitute Agent it would separate the sheep from the goats, and. determine who would fisrfit for their country and who would only talk. It would shut the mouths of those noisy thv.lks who are forever howling about loyalty; by which they mean for some one else to go and fi rht while they stay at. home aud . vote the te pnblican ticket." The amendment, as suggested, wiT be made sootier or later. The men who v ed lor the re-elect inn of Lincoln under the im pression that his re-election would make Jeff. Davis and his co-Confederates despair of the success of their enterprise, and hence eause them to abandon it, we fear, arc doomed to realize a sore disappointment. And thai class of credulous individuals who supposed that Sherman could bring back Geonria to her duty in the Union, by dimply marching through it, and proclaiming, as glad tidings, the re-election of Lincoln, will before long be awakened to the conviction that they, too, were mistaken. Statesman. Decrease of Kevennts. The Secretary of tho Treasury, in his Re port, makes the following admission: "The increase of duties on imports under tke act of June 30, 1804, has already had the effect to decrease importations to a con siderable extent, and the fame effect will be likely to continue. So that, estimating the remaining quarters by those of the first, in the light of former experience, it will not be safe to calculate upon revenue from customs much exceeding $70,000,000 tor tho current voar." This explodes one of the old High Tariff dogmas, that very high duties raised great revenues. It was pressed upon Congress as a revenue measure; ad k! behold! the re sult is a falling off of nearly oue-third of the Custom House revenues. ' Upon this fact, the Secretary, in die real SDirit of a New England Protectionist, says: "In the judgmont of the Secretary this disadvantage in a financial point of view is more than counterbalanced by the stimulus afforded to domestic industry and . tho con sequent increased revenue from thatsource." . The truth is, the benefit of the stimulus goes to a few wealthy manufacturers in New England, and the whole country is taxed to pay it. Cin. Eng. Quite a Difference . The following is from the Washington City Chronicle, (Rep.): '"At all elections, national or State, 'for many years back, it has been customary for heads of bureau clerks, and other employes of the Government, to organize, contribute -money, publi.-h and distribute documents, ' and also to go home and vote at closely con tested elections. On account of the exis tence of tho war, tho force of cldrk in de partments has been more than quadrupled, and hence the organisation of clerks from the several States has been a powerful means , of advancing tho Ilepublican cause in the ' late campaign." The difference between the clerks under Lincoln and those under previous Presidents lies in the fact that the latter p.id their own ' expenses from and back to Washington, when they went to vote, while, tho former were paid their transportation out of the ' public treasury. . The Democratic clerks taxed themselves. The Lincoln clerks taxed the people. Quite a difference both in pock et and principle. Cin. Enq. Democratic Paper In Ashtabula. In a business letter from a friend in Ash h tabula county, we are informed that there is t an effort being made, which promises to be ' successful, to start a-Democratic, paper in that county, and that it will be placed upon a basis that will enablo it to go ahead. We are glad to learn this. As J he Journal I chronicles with infinite satisfaction the sus pension of evory Democratic paper that comes to its knowledge, it is not expected that this enterprise will receive its earnest , wishes for success. The MoClcllan vote in ' Ashtabula was 1,042. There are only five " counties in the State that gave a smaller dora- pcratielvote. The determination exhibited by the Democrats of Ashtabula to increase .. . their efforts in behalf of tho cause of De mocracy should serve m a stimulus to Democrats in other counties to give to their . .' urirans a more substantial support tbio it 1 any fanner fftivi.SMtetmtn. t , The Democratic Iartjr Never Surrenders! Some of the Abolition papers are calling upon the Democracy to disband their organ ization and join thein in trampling in the dust the Constitutioawind striking down the liberties of the people. They invite us to jniu their party and are honeying us with smooth words and soft tongues, in order to get us to endorse the interests of Abolition ism and Shoddy. The, Democratic party can never have any political fellowship with the men who havei defamed and maligned them. The opposition by their persistent abuse of us as"traitors" and "copperheads," by hooting at our views, by denouncing our principles as "treasonable, ' by claiming for themselves all the "loyalty," have again got possession ofthe Government for four years. They have the machine, and they must run it. The Democracy have no responsibility.' The, Abolitionists control all the State and National Governments, they have all the power, they have command of our purses, our lives and our, money, but they can not compel us to sacrifice our principles. The Democratic organization will be kept up, looking to time and the teachings of events for its vindication. The Democratic party has often been beaten, but IT ne7kr sur renders: It will fight on, fight ever, for the glorious Union principles it lias ever ad vocated, and if the Union is lost if the coun try is ruiiied, it will not bo responsible.. It has no power to make Peace or continue War. I hat rests with the Administration, and the Democratic party is charged with no responsibility as all its schemes for saving the nation have been rejected with morn by the faction "that holds the reins of Govern ment. Seneca Advertiser. A Remarkable Confession ofthe Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury makes the remarkable confession that, if the people had only foreseen the vast expenditures of this war, they rould never, have engaged in it. He says, in speaking of the war in its commencement: . . "Had it been then foreseen that what whs believed to be a contest for months was to be continued for years, and that hundreds of millions of public debt would be swollen into thousands of millions before the close of thatcontest, it may well be doubted wheth er, ignorant as they were of their own im mense resources, the people might hot have shrunk appalled from an undertaking which contemplated a sacrifice so far exceeding all former experience." This draws from him the remark that it was "fortunate" the people were so ignorant. Hear him : ''Unacco-'tomed for a lonr course of years to great national efforts, it was fortunate that their power of endurance should be tested only by degrees, as the struggle which Providence had prepared for them develop ed its vast proportions, and the necessity of great and long continued effort became ap parent." , We never before heard of national short sightedness and ignorance being made a sub ject of congratulation. Cin. Enq. Brick Pomeroy, ofthe La Crosse (Wisl Democrat, urging the adoption of the cash principle upon his brother editors, gets off the following: lie is a poor patron of any place or enter prise who never nays. Such patronage wears credit threadbare. If a man is good, he can pay to-day as well as to-morrow. If he is w t good, you lose money by trusting him. It costs more to collect little bills than they are worth ; men think to themselves, "It is but little I ow9 to the editor, he sore ly don't want or need that I ' ' And as men think about paying such little debts the edi tor is always in hard luck. Others sar, "Oh, I. pay for my paper in political influence?" Who made the political influence but the very editor they sponge upon? Another man is a friend of the editor, and thus wants a paper for nothing. And so he cats up the proiit of a half dozen papers. No class of men in the world do as much work for nothing, as editors. They must puff this and that must publish weddings and deaths must call publio meetings must attend to school and church interests must give to charity pay taxes be curs ed more than other people trust more men have more poor debtsthatt any other busi ness men in the community. Changes in the Cabinet. A meeting was held on Wednesday at the Hot-Corn Exchange in Philadelphia, which resolved that Mr. John W. Forney was the most "fit ajid desertless" man to go into President Lincoln'scabinet as Secretary eith er of the Interior or of the Navy. As Sec retary Stanton "still lives, " this must be ta keu, for the present, as simply a graceful compliment from the hot-corn venders of the City of Brotherly Love to a journalist whom they delight to honor. l'rivato telegrams from Colorado mention thot the friends of W. Cornell Jewett in that territory engaged in the gum-drop busi ness held a similar meeting rewntry at lia coon Hollow, aud nominated that estimable diplomatist as the successor of Mr. Secreta ry Seward. Wo presume that, both appointments will receive tho most serious consideration from the President, notwithstanding the malig nant hostility with which both would be re ceived by the pumpkin-planters of Massa chusetts, who arn pressing Mr. Garrison with great unanimity for the State Depart ment, and Pratt, the American traveler, for the Navy. N. Y. World, Mr. Lincoln's Latest Joke.

Administration iournah are assertlns that notwithstanding the devastation of the last four years, wo hilte at present a much larger population than in 1800, and that this appears conclusively Jrom a comparison ot the votes east at the f residential elections in IfcO t and 1800. It has been suggested that tills apparent increase of population arises from the fact that a great many of those wp.o voted for Lincoln were very care f'ul to vote often. It is to be 'regretted that we cannot now have an enumeration of all tho males over the age of twenty-one. That would settle the question ss to whether our voting population is larger now than it was in I860.

The King was doubtless sorely pushed when he exdaimed, "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse," and another king only paid a just tribute to this noble animal, when he exclaimed -' ':J "And I only won the battle '.' , By forflo of my good steed." ' The war in this country has created an extraordinary demand for horses. Every where the scarcity as well as high price nf horseflesh is appreciated. It behooves the farmers everywhere to turn their attention to the raising of hon-es. A writer in the Xeto Nation, from a large number of ita tistics, deduces the following; " f Agriculture, the sole producer, wdl there fore liave to furnish Civil Consumption ',.., Horses, 73,1 (Jy; niares, 72,105 144.216 Military Cmi.-umption Horses, 72,52; mares, 30,261 103,742 A-n!

In various ways it answers for food for man and beast. In various ways it answers for food for both man and beast. Its stalk makes excellent fodder; the seed has valuable fattening properties, affording excellent food for horses, hogs, chickens, and other animals. When ground the flour from the seed makes a good kind of cake. Its value for syrup is beyond estimate; and though experiments have not yet fully test ed its value for making sugar, sufficient is known to warrant the belief that the day is not distant when overy farmer will be able to make his own sugar from sorghum at a much less cost than he has been compelled to pay for it when raised from the sugar cane. It seems from recent experiments, that this valuable plant is to be of much use in dying. Prof. Ertii, in some recent experiments in this line, says: ''Having found upoll an upper shelf in the laboratory, boiiio cane of hist vear' s erowth. sent here for tho purpose of analysis, and which , had become almost entirely destroyed by insects. I selected a few stalks the outside of which Were more particularly exposed to the atmospheric air, and had become deeply red. With two ounces of the cut cane, a great number of tain pies of cloth were colored , a portion of which were those accompanying this report. The same coloring material found in the stalk is evideutly contained in the seed. It may be proper for me to add that it is not important that the canes should be fully ma tured. As far as tested, I find the colors te resist the action of sunlight and water in a most satisfactory manner." Octi ITeceift for '!u"ino Meat.

Crowded as England is with a hungry population, five per cent, of her soil is not under cultivation. Yet the proportion of the cultivated to the uncultivated hind is higher in England than in any other coun try in Europe. In Russia, less than one filth of the soil is under cultivation; in Swe den onc-soventh; in Austria and Holland, one-fifth; in Switzerland, one-fourth; in France fifty-four hundredths. There is re' ally no need of emigration. In England as appears by a Parliamentary report, there are sixteen millions of acres, wholly unpro ductive, that might easily be made produc tive. The reason why these acres are per mitted to be unimproved is that as soon as they are enclosed, and before they can bo sufficiently reclaimed to produce a paying crop, they become subject to tithe and tax. Hence, only men of largo capital dare un dertake tho task, and they prefer to invest the capital where the return is more speedy and more certaiif. . How to Keep Winter Apples. An Ohio correspondent communicates the following; A neighbor of mine, one year ago, packed eight barrels of winter apples with dry sawdust, and left them headed up, exposed to all tho rigors of our last unusu ally cold winter.

PUNISHMENT. "Isn't it beautiful, George?" "Well, it ft rather pretty," I said, with a half suppressed yawn. "Now, George," she said, indignantly, "that is too bad. Do bo generous lor once. Isn't it perfeotly lore?!?" "Well, I suppose it is if you say so, my dear;" and I leaned back in my chair, and with closed eyes placodly emitted a deuse volume of smoke from my lips. It was six o'clock in the evening, dinner was over, and I had subsided into the com fortable tranquility of my dressing-gown, flippers, and cigar. Alice bad boon out shopping that afternoon, as several pletho ric looking bundles on t he side table testified; and now I must witness and share in the in vestigation of their contents. So 1 listened while my wife commented on the texture of the lineu intended for the bosoms -of my new shuts. Sho then produced a very mysterious looking package, which when divested of its paper covering, proved to be a very hand some black silk pattern. Sho looked so pretty a3 she stood before me the bl ight fire-liaht shining on her sweet face and it was all in a glow; and she was enthusiastic in the nraise of her last purchase, which she was holding up before my unappreeia ting eyes. She was not at all satisfied with the limited praise I bestowed upon it, "How provoking you are! George War den, do you hear? Do take that cigar out of your mouth and come out of your smoke clouds a little while! I never can get a word out of you when you onee get to smoking. Now how much do you suppose I gave for this piece of silk?" Mrs. Warden's husband opened liis eyes and declared he "hadn't the slights idea! how should he know?" Mrs. W. was well aware that he knew little and cared less about the paraphernalia of a lady's toilet. "Only fifty dollars for the patern not a cent more! It's well worth fifty-six; , I've saved that much any how. And it's so rich and thick it'll wear well, I am sure. Now don't you think it cheap?" "Well, rather," and I knocked the ashes from the tip of my cigar and prepared to resume my train of thoughts when Lor voice aroused me again. " But it isn t paid for yet, she was say ing hesitatingly, "I hadn't enough money with me, and I was afraid if I waited till to morrow I should lose the chance, and was sure you wouldn't care just this onocc," she said timidly, as if she wasn't so sure I wouldn't care after all. 1 sat upright all awake in a moment, If there is any thing I abhor it is the credit system I mean where women are conceern e"d. Positively the idea that m:j wife was going in debt for things, and getting into the habit of running up long bills at, the dry goods stores, was more than I could bear. My prophetic eye saw in the future visions of temptation, deception, anxiety, unhappi poss, and, perhaps, ruin all resulting from those terrible bills! , 1 had labored so hard to press upon her mind this one lesson, "Pay as you go." And the thought that she had disobeyed me on the first temptation made me very wrathful. The storm burst over her unconscious liefld. "Alice, is it possible? when I have told you repeatedly never, under any circumstan ces, to get any thing on credit, it you can possibly avoid it. i must say " "It imist be the last! 1 hope I am not nigeanllv. I am willing to let you have all the money you need; but, I will not content to your running up lon.'t bills at the stores. I could tell you how many men of my, ac quaintance have been ruined by their wives doing so. 1 tell you, Alice, you have no idea how a bill will rtih up before you know it. Those little debts seetii very insignifi cant until you put them together. Then, the aggregate is enormous. I did not think wt u-ife Would act in such direct opposition to my known wishes," "Jluti George ;" And , tears came into the brown eyes raised to mine. What a wretch 1 was? Why couldn't I speak kindly to the poor darling, if 1 must tell her of her fault? But no, my heart was full of bitterness because she had disobeyed me, and then it always put me out of humor to' see a woman cry. "I don't want to hear any more about it. Take your dross away; I don't wish to look at it! I hope you will enjoy it, and the re collection that in buying it you disregarded my wishes will doubtless add much to your pleasure in it." ; I think this last cruel speech hurt her more than all tho rest. It makes me furi ous against myself now when I think of it. But I had opened my heart to a venemous, satiriical demon, and ho sat there securely throned, defying all efforts to expel him, grinning with malicious glee while he point ed the barbeil Words which foil like pois on drolis from my tongue. 1 had never spoken so to my wife before. I hated my self for it! I watched her nstlie crossed the room and sat down, away from mei in the recess of a window, with tears dropping fust over her pule cheeks. J low i longed to go ami Dnng tier back, nnd kiss away the remembrance of my harshiiessi But I did not. 1 doiVt know how long tre sat thus, and I kon't know what I was reading; I was only con scious of being very remorseful and very un happy, when a timid, faltering voice startled me out of my abstraction, and caused me to look up. She was standing before me, with the tears not yet dry on her pale face, and the grieved look plainar than ever in her soft eyes. "I don't care about having the dress, Qeorgo. I'll take it back to morrow. I know they will allow me to return it; only pjease do notjlook so. I can bear anything but seeing yon so displeased!" Did I fling down that hateful paper, and seat the trembling pleader on my knee, and kiss the poor pule face till it bloomed again? Alas! the demon whispered, "Forgiveness easily obtained is not. much valued. , Hold out onlv a little longer." And I did; and lost the opportunity which the wealth of world can not buy now! I steeled my heart against those pleading tones. I met the prayerful glance with one so cold that it froze down the upspringing tears, and then I said, coldly, ' ' "No, you shall not do that. If there is any thing I hate it is carrying a thing back after it has been taken. ' Now you've got it, keep it. ' 111 pay the bill when I go down in the morning." ' And that was all. Then I turned to the other aide of the paper and appeared engrossed in a telegram from Washington. I could have cursed myself as I watched her, move wearily back to the window, and sit down with her forehead pressed against the pane so despairingly; and when one or two convulsive sebs, but half stifled, reached me I fairly started, and rustled the paper nervously. Seven o'clock. Alio arose and moved across the room. She stopped a fow m jaee before tbs flan, and I watrbed ber TERMS unseen. I remember now exactly how she looked and was dresed. I never cn forget it, 1 knew not then, as I gazed at her to intently that it was the. Init timel should ev er see her with the current of life warming her veins and flushing her face! Sho wore a black dress. Black was always t!tj Mte; and it set off her pure complexion beautiful ly; high and plain, with no ornaments but the delicate lace about the throat and arms. One thick braid of hair passed across her head, nnd it suited her letter than any coro net. And as she raised her hand to smooth the brown ripples about her forehead the sleeve fell back, and the prettiest round rfrtn von ever saw gleamed out so bewitchiugly! 1 knew very well why she had dressed with so much taste on this paitieular evening. We were going out together to a, birthday party given by a young cousin of hers; for Nora thought that nothing could go right without "Cousin Alice" to superintend. She got her hood and cloak, mating a noise purpo-cly to attract my attention; but I heard noting. Then she came and stood hefore-me while she w-w tying on her hood; and waited some lime for .me to speak; but I would not; and at last she said, timidly: "We are going to Uncle William's to night." "Well?" That was all I said. Then bhe went away looking very sad. Presently a dusky face peered in at the doori "Carriage am ready, misses." "George, are you going with me to night?" "No." "I am very sorrry," she said, meekly; but Nora will be so disappointed if I do aot go, so I must go." "Very well." - I did not look tin till I heard the door close after her. Then I flung the paper aside with a muttered curse, and strotle fiercely to the window., I watched her enter the carriage, and saw it drive off; and then came back to the fire, kicked over d stool and kicked it again where it fell; flung the paper into the, fire, when I punched savage ly for want of something more substantial on which to vent my fury, and then sat down with my face buried in my hands and groan ed bitterly through my clenched teeth. 1 was angry with my suffering, unoffend ing wife because she had gone out without me. I thought sho ought to have staid at home and broken her engagement to humor my absurd caprice, when she did not even know that I wished her to do so. I was al so angry with myself for treating her in such a manner. Never before in all my lite had I felt so. Altogether, I was perfectly mis erable. While I sat there I unconsciously drew from my finger the ring I wore there. I held it up, as I was often in the habit of doing, to read the inscription within; and the words "(Jrici t not the heart that loves tlice" flashed before my gaze flashed into my heart with Mich painful vividness that 1 started and looked around to see who had uttered them. There was no one there. I was alone, and conquered by the talisman of tho ring. "Grieve not the heart that loves thee." It was her gift. These were the words she was wont to murmur, lying with closed eyos and whiteiiandj nestled in mine and the dear head pillowed on my hearti Such tho sweet refrain, breaking ever and anon from the fresh lips, till I hushed their music into eilence by tho pressure of my own. "Grieve not the heart loves thee." It was her voice that spoke to me in the still ness of that lonely room. Oh! no other could have tho power to so thrill icy, soul with feelings such as I had then! Where wa,s she then? Moving amidst the glare and gutter ot the crowded bail-roomr Uii no! I know her spirit came to me in that lonely hour to take a last farewell ( tobrcuthe a parting benedictiou on hi' unworthy headl Tiiiit ring was her gift. She placed it on my finger this tl'iy after we were married; and I promised her soleuily; with her earn est brown eyes looking, into mine, that I would never part with it in life or in death. As 1 sat there holding it in my hand sweet memories of old times Hashed across my mind, like sudden sun-bursts over a dark ened landscape. I thought of the time when I first aked her to be my wife child as she was. It was not long only two years; and they had been such pleasant ones! She was very young, was Alice, when I first brought her to my home only seventeen; and 1 was her senior in years. But I whs older in experience even than in years. Ac customed from very early life to act and think for myself, I had acquired tho habit of domination unconsciously; and Alice, with her tiny figure and fair young face; and clinging, caressing ways, 1 never could think of but as a beautiful child, to be spoiled, and petted, and loved and governed. Heav en knows how I loved and cared for her! But she had never before disobeyed me. Never before had she so wounded not my love for her, but my love of authority. But my heart was softened now, I thought of 11 her caressing, pretty ways how she liikl nursed me during a long illness in the past fall how she would bound into uiy arms when I came homo every evening; and then I thought how dreary my homo would be without her, and ail the repressed tender ness of.my nature welled up. , "Poor child!" I , murmured regretfully, how I have made her suffer! I was harsh. God forgive mo! , Oh, that uhtj were here now that I might take her to my heart, nnd soothe her into forgetfuliiess, my poor dar ling. I looked at the clock. The hands point ed to ten. She never staid out later. "She will soon be here," I naid trustfully; and then I rang tho bell, and had the fire replenished aim the room arranged against her coming. I drew her favoi ite chair up into the bright blaze, aud placed my own beside it; then I went to the windiw and looked impatiently down the moonlit avenue. Not coming yet! I walked up the floor once or twice; and then to beguile the tedi ous moments, entered into an investigation of tho contents of her little work basket which stood on a table. But I dropped it quickly, for I heard the carriage coming up the avenue. I was at the door as soou as if stopped, and opened it eagerly. My wife sat with her face turned from me, and quite hidden by the large woolen hood. "Are you not very cold aud tired, dear?" I raid, my voice trembling with impatient tenderness as I extended my hand to assist her to rise; but there was no answer, and sha remained quite still. , ' "Alice, love, speak to mef Do" yds not hear?" Silent still! Then I thought ehe had fal len asleep, and took her hand to awakeit ber. It was so cold that I started back chilled. "How cold you are, dear Alicel Are you ill?" And I leaned forward and pushed the hood from her face so motionless it might have boen. carved in stone. The moonlight ihown full upon it, and on the precious blue eyes, wide open, but dimmed and filmed. Dead! O God! Not L I would not allow myself to think of it.-4 "She has fainted," I said; and carried her swiftly into the Housaatii laid her on. the Kf, I knew nothing of tbe grtl sn 62 PER ANNUM crowd of terror-stricken semits around me saw nothing, heard nothing, felt nothing for -a time. Every thought, every faculty was concentrated in my anxiety for her. I knelt ' beside her, and chafed the dead hands and temples, and pressed my warm,, lii)g lips tl the beautiful cold mouth, as if seeking to -breStbe into them the breath of life. Vain!' rain! She never looked on me or spoke to me again. A hand was laid on my shoulder; a quiet, kindly voice bade me move aside a inomint, ., and our grave, gray-haired family physician laid his fingers on the white wrist, and then placed them on the still heart, and then, shaking his head tadly, turned away. - I . heard the words "Duease of. the heart.". ' That was all. They left me alone with my dead Kt last. There is that room where I had seen bet. alive for the )at time where I had o -wounded the dear heart whose last throb , was for hie! The fire glowed as brightly as ever. There stood her piano, itil! open, with a f'avorate song upon it. There was her work table, with her little basket upon it, and the book the had been reading, with a utue ribbon to marirtue placet Ah tre on a table were the things the had bought that evening, together with ' the piece of silk which hud caused bt) much grief! Tbe apron she had worn was thrown carelessly . eves the chair which 1 had drawn up to the , tire to be in readiness when she returned. She -had corne back to me. But it seemed as if she had come in some terrible dreamt, from which lean never awake. ". . WAstosSroN, Deo. 12. " Senate. The Senute was called to order by Mr. Ciark, President pro tern. , . Sir.
