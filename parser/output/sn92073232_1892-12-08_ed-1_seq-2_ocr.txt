Sub scription 50 cents per month, or $5 per annum, payable in advance. Immediate tariff reform is de manded ! No more Baby McKee domiDation in the W hite House! Winston extends its hand of sym pathy to Fayetteville. He who devotes himself wholly to selfish aims cannot bea pood citizen. The more the farmers think, the smaller is the Republican vote. Tabiff Reform. Pension Reform. Immigration Reform. Don't delay them ! If Martin Luther had been a law yer he would not have been a re former. Nothing can be sadder than the visit of a lawyer to the grave of his "only client. Music is a good thing but the too frequent jingling of money may dwarf the soul. Some things are very difficult. For example, finding readable news in the Union Republican. No Farmers Alliance will not pasB resolutions of condolence because of Jay Gould's death. Good ideas are good things and they are particularly valuable when they are your own. Good-natured people are liked; the same is true of good-natured newspapers like the Sentinel. What is the matter with an intelli gence qualification for the suffrage? Mississippi says it's all right. The Grover Cleveland of Mexico is President Diaz who has bten thrice nominated for the Presidency. The people demand relief from the burdens of the McKinley tariff law. Therefore, an extra session is needed! When a mule undertakes 6iDging he is a complete failure. Everything is useful in its way, but not other wise. For nearly a month California has been asking herself "Where ami at?" Now ,she is safely in the Cleveland column. Electing Senators by direct vote of the people would prevent the cor ruption of Western Legislatures in hat regard. The Wilkesboro Chronicle nomi nates Senator Gorman for the Presi dency in 1896. We don't second the nomination. . None of us saw the Fall of the Roman Empire, but we are likely to see a. greater event in the. World's Fair at Chicago. The pension list is an unequal bur den. It lays heavy upon the South. As this is a nation there should be no sectional discrimination. The. question whether a wolf can go faster than a man on a bicycle depends much upon the hunger of the wolf and the vi jror of the man. Col. Cockerill of the New York Advertiser made himself an ass be fore election and apparently he has no desire to do any better now. Let the government stop subsidiz ing railroads, steamship lines or big canals, and begin to improve our common roads for the humble farmer. Pensions eat up nearly forty per cent, of the nation's income. Re member that pension money is paid to those who never fought or risked their lives. Tubd party people said they were going to carry Virginia, but that was before election. Cleveland had 163,977 votes while Weaver had but 12,274. It is difficult to believe that Grover Cleveland, who made the tariff the one subject of a Presidential messagef will favor a delay in reforming the McKinley bill. The vote of the people against Mc Kinleyism and kiadred evils in the years 1890, 1891 and 1892 was too decisive to be ignored. Therefore, an extra.session I This is a protectionist country and has been prosperous. Spain is a protectionist country and has not been prosperous. Therefore, Protec tion is what? . Lawyers are conservative. Their calling makes them respect precedent too highly. If the world had clung closely to precedents, we would have had no progress. A German professor who says that among its shop girls or shopping ladies no city in Europe can vie with Baltimore for loveliness, is very pop ular in the Monumental City. South Carolina haa the distinc tion of being the only State in the Union which has no divorce law. In most Western States getting married and gettiDg divorced are equally easy. According to Senator Mitchell of Oregon, the Republicans are ready to defend the McKinley bill from Democratic aseaults. This means that they are ready to resist the will of the people. North Carolina will be interested to observe the inception and progress of the steamship line between Liver pool and Newport News. Our State would then have an important sea port not far from our borders. The will of the people is the su preme law. But the Republican par ty proposes to kick against the will of the people as declared by over whelming majorities in 1890, 1891 and 1892. In a Swiss canton a t-kelton has beer, found which a spectacled arcbas ologit fstimatep to be be 240,000 years of age. We are inclined to think that this learned man based his estimate on Cleveland's majority over Harrison. TiiE Sentinel takes pleasure in commending to the next adminis tration the Hon. VV. R. Henry of Henderson. Since he ,rcw to be a man he has given his best efforts to the Democratic party and during the last campaign he was zealous, earn est and helpful. The Radical party would penbion everybody who voted to keep them in power. It added over 200,000 pensioners in the last fiscal year. Cleveland vetoed the Dependent Pen sion bill but under Harrison there hare been 920,357 claims filed under that law. The town f Marquette, Mich., is proving that it is possible to run a city without any taxes. Wouldn't that be delightful, citizens of Wins ton Salem? That town pays nearly all its expenses from the profits of its municipal electric light plant and the pale of power to manufacturers. Senator Hiscock, a Republican, re-presents New York State which has gone Democratic every year for three years. Senators should be elected by the people. Then Democrats would represent Democratic States, and Republicans represent Republican States. Third party people will be pleased to know that the railway system of Italy is owned chiefly by the govern ment, tho' it is operated by priyate companies under lease. In this way the government gets $50,000,000 a year besides 27Mper cent of the gross earnings. Postmaster General Wanamaker is guilty of injustice and discrimina tion when he refuses to allow Print ers' Ink to go through the mails with the privileges of second-class matter while he permits his own publication, Book News, to have the usual post office privileges. We are glad that the Wanamaker regime will be over before nianymoHths. In North Dakota the vote was so close that it is not yet decided wheth er Harrison or Weaver is entitled to the electors. The Republicans voted a number of Indians, but if it be de cided that these red men had no right to vote, then Weaver carries the State. Otherwise, it is a victory for Republicans and savages. The tendency of the day is to en large the functions of municipal gov ernment. Birmingham, England, for example, builds its own street rail roads, makes and sell its own gas,, provides free museums and an art gallery and even adds swimmingand Turkish baths. That city, formerly corrupt, now enjoys the reputation of being the best governed city in the world Therefore we say that the State should not hamper the local governments within" its borders. 

LOCATION OF A PARK. This subject should interest every North Carolinian because in this State are the scenic beauties, the mountains, the diversified landscape and the other natural advantages which will determine the selection of a site. In Western Xarolina we have "The Land of the Sky." On this point we reprint the following from the Ashe ville Citizen : "In discussing the question the Richmond Dispatch, a warm advo cate of the scheme of a national park in the East, seems to dismiss Vir ginia from the rank of a competitor, partly because the Blue Ridge in that State, the more eastern of the paral lel raBges, has been long settled, the i mountains lower than in North Car olina, their bases narrower; and con tinued long occupation has much subdued their natural wildness and picturesqueness. The western, the higher and the rougher range,' is so rich in mineral wealth, coal, iron, gypsum, salt, etc., that private own ership would never be surrendered except at great cost; and even then would never be free from unlawful in vasion and violation ef such' rules and regulations as would be needed to preserye the integrity of what would become, by purchase, national domain. Therefore, no locality re mains to be considered except North Carolina, and the contiguous terri tory of East Tennessee, in which na ture still asserts her reign, and where ahe can invite safely to the preserva tion of her natural features to the extent required. Marriages in tlie County. Miss Nancy M. Morris, youngest daughter of S. Morris, was .married to M. B. Mecum at Walkertown on Nov. 24. The ceremony was performed bv Esquire E. W. Linville at the home of the bride's mother. Miss Lou C. Teague and Wm. H. Hester were married by Esquire Lin ville at the residence of the bride's mother in Kernersville township Nov. 24. .

TRESTLI5 FALLS. An Engine and Five Loaded Freight Cars go Down. About 8 p. m., Thursday night the long trestle leading out from the Norfolk & Western depot and cross ing Third Street, went down, carry ing with it a 57 ton freight engine and five freight cars, loaded with coal and wood. The collapse was heard all over town and created, for a time, con siderable excitement. The train was shifting when the accident occurred. The engine was nearly across when the timbers gave way about midway with the frieght cars. The engine and tender were jerked back several feet with learful force, but strange to pay hey were far less damaged than the box cars. Neither of the former left the cross ties but the engines was left standing partially upright. Fortunately there were but two men injured and these only slightly. Phil Hay had charge of the throttle and was doing the shifting. James Ebert was on the engine with him. Both were badly shaken up and no ot-eexpected them to be rescued alive. They jumped out as the engine fell. A colored brakeman also jumped several feet from the top of a car without sustaining any injuries. Dr. R. F. Gray was (summoned at once and rendered the necessary medical attention. Mr. Hay wa carried to the home of his parents on Fourth street and Mr. Ebert to his boarding house at Henry Burke's on Liberty street. The injuries of both were slight. ' The Trestle Completed . The new trestle leading out from the Norfolk & Western depot was completed Monday afternoon and the first train passed over at four o'clock. This shows rapid work. The wreck occurred last Thursday night and the work ' of rebuilding was not commenced until Friday morning. No one entertained the idea that the trestle would be completed so soon. Capt.TJarger, it appears, was surprised himself. He said trains would cross over by today. . Three forces were employed each working eight hours day and night. CAN A CUTTINGS. Farmers Posting Their Lands and the Hunters Complaining. Correspondence of The Sentinel. Cana, N. C, Pec. 5. Was it an air ship the astronomers saw some time ago belonging to some - neighboring planet, which they took to be a comet? If so, inventors in that star are ahead of any on this terrestrial ball. . Mr. J. W. Etchison loaded a car with oak lumber for New York, last week. Most land owners in these parts are posting their lands. Hunters com plain of this, but they would complain if they had to be hung. I hear of one old negro in Yadkin who said "Mas Harrison shore elected. If Cleveland is 'lected dey wont let him take his seat." You can nearly tell a revenue officer now by the way he looks. So forlorn. Let'sihave economy if it costs an ex tra session of Congress to get-it. That is what the people elected the Demo crats for. They were made to believe no other party would do it so it is im perative. J. W. Eaton had a shucking Satur day night. Alter it was over the boys had a scuffle. The result was that Van Eaton sot his collar bone broken. "It will now be in order for those who participated in the scuffle to see that Eaton's family does not suffer while he is disabled from work. -, Vox.

A number of gentlemen belonging to the Tobacco Growers' Association have agreed to subscribe several thousand dollars for defraying expenses incident to introducing tobacco culture among farmers by furnishing them free seed, giving instructions, etc." The presi dent of the Tobacco Growers' Associ tion has declared "that carelul and disinterested tests had demonstrated beyond doubt the capacity of the soil of east Tennessee to produce as fine tobacco as North Carolina, not ex cepting the famous golden leaf.
