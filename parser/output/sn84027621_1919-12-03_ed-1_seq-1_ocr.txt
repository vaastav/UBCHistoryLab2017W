Commissioners and Leading Bond Ad vocates are Already Consider ing Another Campaign There were many fluctuations of opinion on the bond issue election Tuesday. At suppertime the bond advocates in Ocala were almost sure of victory. Ocala had gone two to one -for bonds and other precincts sent in reports that put that side about 250 to the good ''with only fourteen precincts to hear from," the bend boys joyfully said. The old men shook their heads. They knew what those fourteen pre cincts could do in "an election. And they did it. climbing steadily until bed time, when with only one to hear from bonds were twenty-five votes behind. We have not learned the vote by precincts. Ocala voted for bonds by 299 to 148. Mcintosh so far is the banner bond precinct, casting sixty seven for to one against. The county commissioners report this morning that bonds were beaten by about fifty votes in a total of about 1600 the closest contest we can re member in this county. In consequence of this unexpected ly large bond vote, and the certainty that many would have voted for bonds under a somewhat different plan, the commissioners are considering calling another election, as the $280,000 worth of help from the federal and state governments is too much for a countxto refuse.

As an aftermath of the world war a new standard of living has been es tablished and a new standard of prices has been established. To meet these new conditions a revised stand ard in business must, of necessity, be brought about. , During the war, for example, many business houses, un able to obtain first class materials, were compelled to use inferior ma terials in the manufacture of goods. As a result some concerns will be tempted to continue the use of in ferior materials, so long as they can get away with it. The war has brought about new re lationships between employer and employee. These problems Interna tional . Rotary is doing all that it can to help solve. Every Rotarian in the city should be at the luncheon Friday. "Big eats" are promised.
