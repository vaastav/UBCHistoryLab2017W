RATES. Giles Reasons Why He Favors President's Plan. ■Washington, Dec. s.— Senator Klkins, chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce, after reading the Presidents message to-day, made the following statement regarding railroad rate legis lation: "As I understand It, the President does not de sire to vest in the commission arbitrary and un controlled power to fix rates.. He has repeatedly stated that the action of the commission in fix ing a rate should be subject to review by the courts and that the. railroad companies should have legal protection against any injustice. That being the case, a law giving to the commission power to fix rates should not he rjrawn In such manner ss to give ithe commission purely legis lative discretion In Wising rates. It should give to the commission power to change an existing rate only if the existing rate be unreasonable or otherwise in violation of the interstate commerce acts, and it should giv» to the commission power to change a. rate that is unreasonable, or otherwise unlawful only to the extent that such change may be necessary in order to remove the unreason ableness or other illegality of the rate. In other words, it should only give to the com mission power to reduce a rate to the maximum that would be. reasonable and lawful if originally imposed by the railway company. A statute can be drawn to effect this result. If those who ad vocate vesting in the Interstate Commerce Com mission the power to fix rates are in good faith seeking to carry out the policy of the President, they should be willing to accept a statute giving to the commission power to flx rates substantially in the following terms: "Whenever any rate, fare or charge fixed by any common carrier for ajiy service shall be unreason able, or unjustly discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of any provision of tiie act approved Feb ruary *. 1867, entitled, 'An Act to Regulate Com merce,' or any act amendatory thereof the Inter state Commerce. Commission shall have power, aft<-r Investigating the facts and hearing the parties affected, to make an order modifying sucli rate fare or charge, as far as may be. necessary. In order to remove the unreasonableness, unjust 'dis crimination or other illegality thereof, aiid such order shall take effect at the expiration of such tlma as the commission shall prescribe not less than days after publication thereof. "Any party affected by such order shall he en titled to institute a proceeding to review such order in the Circuit Court of the United States for any district through which the line of the carri'i may run, and if th« court in such proceeding shall find that the rate, rixe.d by such carrier was not un reasonable, unjustly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful, it Hh.-i!l ent.-r a derreo setting aside such order; but if the court shall find that such order modified the rate, fare or charge, fixed by the car rier, either more or less than was necessary, in order to remove tha unreasonableness, unjust dis crimination or other illegality of such rate, fare or charge, then the court, by its decree may modify and correct euch order accordingly." Senator Elkins said he would favor such a meas ure as he had outlined, and believed it meant a solution of the problem that had been agitating the country for a long time. This is tha first indica tion that has been given by Senator Elkins as to the railroad legislation he would support.

MAY-YORK DAILY TRIBTXE, WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 0. .1.1)05. ART WORKS FOR CAPITAL Freer Collection Brings National Gallery Nearer. [From The Tribune Bureau! Washington, Dec. s.— President Roosevelt's pur pose to establish a national art 6Ociety at the cap ital received another impetus to-day. The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, in reg ular meeting to-day, decided to accept the offer of Charles L» Freer, of Detroit. Mich., to bring to Washington in the present session of Congress such portions of his art coliection as might fairly represent the whole, and to request the secretary of the institution to provide a suitable place in that •building or the United States National Museum for exhibiting the collection. Attorney General Moody, by the President's direction, has already instituted proceedings for the United States to ac quire the Harriet Lane-Johnston collection as a nucleus for the proposed gallery of the nation. Those present at the meeting of the Regents to day were the chancellor. Chief Justice Melville W. Puller; R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, jr.. Hugh A. Dinsmore, Dr. Andrew D. White, Judge George Gray, John B. Henderson and Professor Langley, secretary. The following official statement of the action of the Regents was made after the meeting: In view of the fact that Mr. Freer has expressed his willingness to bring such portions of his colleo tion as might fairly represent the whole to Wash ington during the present session of Congress, it was resolved that the secretary be requested to provide a suitable place in the building of the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Na tional Museum for the exhibit of such collections as Mr. Freer may desire to bring to Washington, and that he communicate with Mr. Freer to ascer tain what time would be most convenient for the exhibit of a representative selection as agreed upon between Mr. Freer and the committee of the Board of Regents. The secretary of the board was requested to ex press to Mr. Freer the high appreciation of the generosity exhibited by him. The collection of Charles I* Freer, of Detroit, who was one of the art executors of Whistler, is valued at $600,000.. It consists of nearly six hundred of the famous art etchings, one hundred and fifty lithographs, forty-seven works in oil, including some of his most celebrated pictures; thirty of his water colors, twenty-two pastels .md five drawings. Besides the pictures, there is a collection of bronzes Hi-.d Oriental art objects that is said to be the finest in the country outside th.-> Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the.re are a number of pictures, not by Whlsller. but by other well known American art ists. It is pointed nut that the offer is not a donation at all. but a proposal 10 make a bequest to the In stitution. Mr. Freer intends to draw his will in a certain way if the Smithsonian is willing to as sume the responsibility for carrying out the pro visions. One of the provisions is that the collodion shall be kept intact, and nothing added to or tak»n from it after the death of the tostetor, but this provision will undoubtedly be modified. oth^r American collectors are awaiting the de cision on the Freer offer before presenting their collections to the nation.

The PIANOLA PIANO or PIANOLA IT WILL FURNISH ENTERTAINMENT ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND EVERY DAY OP THE YEAR IN CITY OR COUNTRY HOME CHRISTMAS of 1904 completely demonstrated the superiority of the Pianola Piano as the Christmas Gift par excellence, and indeed what gift could be more befitting the Holiday sea son, more in the spirit of Christmas, than a gift of an inexhaustible fund of pleasure for every member of the family? But those fortunate in securing the Pianola Piano last Christmas have found that it not only served as a center of holiday enjoyment, but in addition proved an invaluable source of pleasure and profit throughout the entire year. Home study clubs were formed, affording every member of the family an educated appreciation of the masters; all dull moments incident to the home Hfe were enlivened with the bright bits of comic opera and catchy songs, and every member of the family found in the Pianola Piano a never-failing source of recreation and delight. Thus the Pianola Piano combines a fulness of m^TjjP musical enjoyment, the ability to meet every musical whiT'S* r^-;»';T of .n 7 23« i requirement with an opportunity for the higher form of musical education and understanding of the really great music — and best of all. its full resources are open to every member of the family alike. With such abundant resources the Pianola Piano becomes the chief of all modern means contributing toward a pleasant and profitable home life, and Christmas of 1905 finds its popularity so world-wide that an investigation becomes a duty to the head of every home desiring to afford his family the modern advantages making for home enjoyment and culture. . Any make of piano will be taken in exchange for a Pianola Piano. Easy monthly payment* will be accepted. The AEOLIAN COMPANY, Aeolian Hall, nea^E'S . A^"£, r *. OFFICE FOB HUGHES. His Name Mentioned for United States District Attorney. [From The Tribune Bureau.] Washington, Dec. s.— Senator Platt said to day that he had heard that Timothy Woodruff. the Republican leader of Kings County, was coming to Washington to consult with the Presi dent to-morrow, but that he did not know the purpose of Mr. Woodruff's visit. Asked if the organization of Kings County was as much in need of reorganization as that of Manhattan, the Senator replied that it was not. Senator Platt further said that he believed Postmaster Roberts would be reappointed post master of Brooklyn. The Senator to-day urged on the President the reappointment of Robert Shar':ey as naval officer of the port of New- York, but did not receive much encouragement. While the investigation of Mr. Sharkey's record, which was conducted some time ago under in structions from the President, did not reveal grounds which seemed to warrant that officials dismissal, it did reveal facts which, it was rep resented to the President, should preclude his reappointment. The President has reached no decision regard ing the appointment of a successor to (Vneral Burnett, District Attorney for the Southern Dis trict of New-York, but it is known that Charles K. Hughes has been warmly indorsed for the position and that the President has his name under consideration. NE W

"CHINA TRADE DOOMED." Captain Baker Says Australia and Japan Benefit by Boycott. San Francisco, Doc. 5. — Captain A. C. Baker of the cruiser Kaleigh. who has been detached for several months to study commercial and po litical conditions in China, was a passenger on the Manchuria, arriving to-day from the Orient on his way to Washington to lay before the President and his advisers the result"; of his investigation. Captain Baker said: It is nonsense to talk of the boycott is dying out. The commercial situation i:i the south of china is absolutely at the mercy of the guilds. There are seventy-one of these, and they con trol trade with an iron hand, and thry have given orders not to handle American gootfs. American houses in Canton are full to the roofs with flour, and they cannot budge It In the mean time Australian merchants aro .ii;ir tering everything they can get their hands cm to rush their inferior flour into the market to tak» advantage of our difficulty. Not only the Australians but the Japanese also are taking advantage of the boycott to get our business. Cotton mills are being . lished iiV China by Japanese houses, and with cheap labor and u<» transportation charges they are in a position to drive us out of the field. They will also develop the steel ore of ('on»a and probably the oil. In this way nur vast kerosene and steel business there will be taken over by the Japanese. The only thing that could raise tho boycott would be to rescind the Chinese exclusion laws, and this, of course, will not be done. Ft looks a.s though our business relations with China ware doomed. The boycott is getting worse every day there. TO
