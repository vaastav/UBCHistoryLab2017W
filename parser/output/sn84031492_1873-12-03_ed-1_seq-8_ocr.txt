D., of Chicago, was elect ed Missionary Bishop of tho Northwest. Mr. Ohouoy thou zuado a fow remarks with all oaruostnoss in his tone and manner, and with trembling voice ho said God only know how pained ho was at tho result of tho voto. Ho was unfitted in every way for*tho ofilco. Evor since tho movement was begun ho had folt sure that tho coutro would bo in Chicago, and that the Church should bo built up there, and that success in that direction was of more consoquonco than a Bishop. In consid eration of his present position, he thoughthowas qualified for local work, but it would be impossible for him to do both. Ho had como at tho request of tho Vestry, without thought of the possibility of such a result, and for him to go back and say that ho should leave them, was something ho could not possi bly do. Ho was compelled to say ho could not accept tho position tendered him. TUoiiup Cummins, tho Rev. Mr. Smith, and the Rev. Mr. Leacock strenuously urged him to ac cept it. Dr. Chouoy replied that ho could not think of taking tho stop until ho had consulted with his congregation. It was resolved by tho meeting that, in case ho should subsequently accept tho position, ho should be duly ordained. Tho mooting then ad journed sine die. fTo the Associated Press.

Second— This Church recognizes uud adheres to Episcopacy, not us of Divine right, but as ' © very ancient ami desirable form of church policy. Third— I Tho Church, retaining a liturgy which will not bo Imperative or repressive of freedom lu’praycr, accepts tiie book of Common Prayer as it was revised, prepared, &ml recommended for uko by tho General Convention of tho Protestant Episcopal Church, A. D. 1783, reserving full liberty to alter, enlarge, abridge, and amend tho same, as may seem musk conducive to the education of the people, provided that tho sub stance of tho faith bo kept entire. Fourth— This Caurch condemns and rejects the fol lowing erroneous uud strange doctrines as contrary to God’s Word: (d.) That tho Ohnrch of Christ exists only in ac cordance with one order or form of ecclesiastical poh- cy. (6.) That Christian ministers oro priests In Another souse than that m which all believers aro a social priesthood. (c.) That the Lord’s table in nn altar on which an obiatlou of the body and blood of Christ Is ottered anew to (ho Father. (d.) That the presence of Christ In thoLord’s Supper is a presence lu the elements of bread and wine. (r.) That regeneration Is inseparably connected with baptism.

Finally, as a compromise, it was agreed that ho should havo time to consult his congregation in Chicago, after which tbo Council adjourned sine die. From the lowa Church ifinsionary for Deumber, 1878. My Deai; Brother : I have, with many oth ers, boon deeply pained at your course in a pro posed separation of yoursolf from tho Protest ant Episcopal Church. I say “ proposed sepa ration,'* for tho act is not yet canonically con summated, and thoro is even room for hope that you may bo led to TO RECONSIDER YOUR ACTION, and romain in tho communion in connection with which youhavo spent bo many of your best years, and in an ofilco to which you wore solemnly con secrated in tho samo connection, and which, it seems to mo, you cannot relinquish without in volving yourself in much unhappiness as tho great mistake of your life. 1 was ono of your cousocrators, aud had tho honor of preaching tho sermon on tho interesting and solemn occasion. I have long known and loved you; and it is ono proof of my affootlon that I address to you thoso words of fraternal remon strance and expostulation. You are well awaro that MY GENEROUS SYMPATHIES have boon with you in tho differences and con troversies that have characterized our Ohuroh and the Church of England for some years past; although I may not havo taken os extreme ground in thcso'aa you have felt it your duty to occupy. I havo participated very strongly In tho opposi tion to tho Ritualistic system, fooling that it involved serious doctrinal errors, and that it was calculated to do us immense harm as a Church, both iu alienating many of our own people, end in doing us dis credit in tho estimation of Protestant Christen dom. I havo never been more opposed to that system than lam now; and I cannot conceive it possible that I shall over regard it with any favor or sympathy. I believe in my heart that what I understand by Ritualism is not only for eign to tho real genius and touching of tho Protestant Episcopal Church, but that it is actu ally and radically subversive of its primitive and scriptural character. But, my dear Brother, the Church, as such, is NOT AT ALL COMMITTED to this system. She remains as she has boon for years and generations. No ono Rit ualistic doctrine ban received her legisla tive sanction; and she simply shows her moderation and comprehensiveness by bearing with her mistaken children until they shall bo brought to a bettor mind. It is my own hope and belief that, in tho lonj run , she will come out all right, though her present chasten ing is not joyous, but grievous. And I believe, further, that it is tho duty of her friends to stand by her in this time of tiial, and do battle with her, if uoed bo, within her pale, and not desert her when she most needs their help. I believe her to bo a true branch of the Universal Church of Christ, and, lake her all in nil, I believe her to ho tho purest branch of that Church iu all the world, iu her doctrine, polity, dis cipline, and worship. 1 do not believe that it is necessary to desert her unless she herself deserts tho truo faith of tho Gospel, and proves false to hor avowed char acter and principles. Permit mo to say, in all affection and frankness, that 1 cannot say that your published motives for leaving hor pale aro AT ALL 

SUFFICIENT to warrant and justify a decision involving such serious consequences. Your letter to tho vener able providing Bishop surprises mo in its lack of adequate reasons for your course. Tho objec tionable practicoo ip Kentucky, to which you re fer. can hardly bo regarded as insuperable. It would seem that two Bishops, and tho good sense of tho clergy and luilv in general, might iu time havo mitigated and removed this un pleasant objection. In my own Diocese, I havo scarcely any trouble of tins kind,—l may say none at all that is occasioned by any actual Ritualism. Now and thou I may havo been somewhat annoyed by a slight development of the epidemic, but it has soon passed away, and for the most part no novelties disturb our peace. My face is sot as a Hint against these foreign mid disturbing elements. 1 consider them as indi cating a morbid state of mind, as I do also thoso radical views in another direction, which seem to mo to havo a disorganizing tendency aud effect, and to make man unnecessarily uneasy and dis contented in n Church which has nurtured so many saints of God, and which has Apostles and Prophets as a foundation, Jesus Ghruib Himself being tho Ohlcf Corner-Stone. You say, my dear brother, that you have lost all hopo that the Ritualistic system either can or will be eradicated by any action of tho author! • ities of tho Church, legislative or executive. I.CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU that the case Is hopeless. I admit that the state of things in tho Church of England and in her daughter Church hero is depressing ami dis couraging ; but lot us not look on the dark side alone, when thoro is a bright side also. When in Emrlaml, at tho Lambeth Conference, in 1807, I saw much to regret and condemn in tho Mother Church, and I endeavored to boar my feeble testimony against tho views and practices that 1 folt, amt still feel, to bo inimical to her best interests, and full of danger to hor truo life as an integral part of tho Church of Christ. This testimony was homo iu a published iottor to tho then Bishop of London, now tho Archbishop of Canterbury: and I have tho satisfaction of knowing that 1 had tins sympathy of Dr. Tail in my views, ami that ho is now, as then, strongly opposed to the Ritualistic system. A majority of tho Bishops in England are olao opposed to tho mischievous system, aud so aro tho great body of tho clergy and laity of that Church. Tho samo is truo hero. Tho real Ritualists aro A SMALL MINORITY of our Bishops, clergy, ami laity. They are In deed un active and earnest minority; hut there is uo probability that they will bo able to gain tho ascendency in tho Church. Give them rope enough, mid, according to present signs, they will effectually hang thomHolvos in duo lime. Wc may feci soino of tho effects of thou* move mentbut I foci quits certain that tho Church at largo will not adopt or amici lon their views or pracliccH, so far as they uto “ erroneous aud strange,” and “ contrary to God’s Word.” The Church herself not having given countenance to this system, and it nut being generally provident, I repeat that I cannot tuku your vlow that the case is so hopeless as to justify a imputation from her raored fold. 1 do not doom it necessary to dwali at length I’HE 

CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1873. nnon the third reason yon assign for your course. With some atrlcturea that have boon made upon YOUR AOT IN TUB REV. DU. HALL’S OnUIIOII Ido not sympathize; though I myself, as a Bishop, should nob have thought it necessary to do what you did. To nave oven a more his torical ecclesiastical principle, I should havo thought that you would have boon invited to preside on the occasion, or at least to consecrate tho elements according to our own form ; especially an tho Presbyterians do not hold tho principle in question, and re gard our own ecclesiastical status as at least equal to their own. Such a course, however, may have boon regarded as impracticable. In any case, 1 doubt not that you acted in all sincerity, and with tho best mol Ives, Ido not for a moment suppose that you intended any departure from tho order of tho Church, or any violation of its laws or of your own vown, hut regarded your self as acting simply in your individual capacity, and in tho .exorcise or a broad Christian free dom. I do not fool disposed to sit as Judgo upon your conduct in thin matter of jolnt-oommuuion; but I raiißt way that, in my opinion, tho criti cisms pawed upon *ou for this act DO NOT 

CONSTITUTE A VALID REASON for such a stop an a desertion of a Scriptural and Historical Church, and tho inauguration of a movement which nuy result in tho formation of a now religious body, at the hazard of an In cronao of tho existing ovilo of separation and division among tho members of tho professed household of God. If you felt that you had dono right, why not bravely nbido all tho con sequences, and not bo driven away from tho Church by what you considered intolerant and views of Christian liberty and Christian duty ? Dudor ail tho circum stances, many •of your host friends f elt that your act, especially as a Bishop of tho Church, was at least inexpedient, and so regretted it; but they did not generally antici pate that you could bo brought to your present decision by any animadversions upon a course which you believed to bo right, and not incom patible with your position or duty as a Bishop of “this Church.” I had reached this precise point in mv already too long letter, when I saw in tho public panors a notice of tho proposed mooting iu Now I’ork next week, for the purpose of organizing a now Lplscopnl Church. I 

DEEPLY 11EOHET THIS MOVEMENT, though I am free to say that the responsibility of it is a divided one. It has, mmy opinion, been precipitated by extreme views and practices in an opposite direction, as well as by an unwise and unfortunate exorcise of ooolerioatioal discipline. iuoßo have boon the occasion of most serious, though of course unintentional, injury to tho Church. Whatever blame there may have boon m this onootion, I yet cannot feel that you and your wsodntoa are thereby justified In your present position. I know full well how hard It is Ko bear what you and many others have homo, in connection with tho present condition of our Church j hut it does not appear to mo (hat the point has yet boon reached, oven if itevcrcau be, when an actual division and separation are justified and demanded by tho leadings of God’s Providence. I could earnestly desire and pray that & now and diulinot organization 

MIGHT NOT RE EFFECTED at tho proposed mooting. A oocosalonal or Bohismatical movement at this time would, in my opinion, bo a greater evil than those wo aro now boating, and from which we may hopo to bo relieved in duo time. It were far bettor for our extreme Ritualistic brethren to finally secede to tho Church of Romo, to which they are tending, than for yourself and others of like mind to leave such a Church as omu fora now ecclesias tical organization. I pray yon to pause and con sider before committing yourself fully to such a step, and may God the Holy Ghost guide and direct you In all things I I began my letter with simple reference to yourself, and for your personal perusal; but you may make imoh use of it as you see fit, aud I reserve tho same privilege for niyaolf.

Tho subject Is generally dismissed with a smile, and Is believed to cover about all tho weak en terprises that could be put In the apace It occu pies. Tho project of building residences for Cabinet Minister* md Senators Is sot down as ridiculous, and was received with a broad grin by members of the House, which gave place to a ludicrous indignant expression at bolng , loft out in tho cold.

Very few opinions differ from tho godoiiall ver dict, that tho message is one of the weakest papers that has come from the White Itlouae, and, from its general make-up, no one 'doubts that it was prepared by tho President, vilih but little assistance from his Private SeoroUity and officious statesmen. THE 

LOUISIANA lOSSinERS, Tho contest in tho House to-day over Jtho ad mission of Sypher, Sheldon, and Pimobhauk, from Louisiana, was narrowed down to a strict party fight, tho Democrats going in a r.uaes for tho Warmouth appointments, while tho 'Republi cans, with the single exception of HJiowart L. Woodford, of Now York, and the mtiuibors of tho old Committee on Election n, sided with tho Pinohbaok appointees.

The question of frauds at tho ballot-box belongs In the first instance to the CommitU/s on Elec tions, and had no pluoo in the disown don to-day. Syphor is not personally popular in the House, and it was mainly through tho infiiu'iuco of Gon.

Tho President’s letter merely certifies that Camontor was in his company ou tho even ing referred to. and that ho was not intoxicated. Bliss says that ho has boon the professional advisor of tho lady .in tho case; that her character ia irreproachable, and that tho Tribune correspondent virtually acknowledged to him that tho story was lalec, and that his only object in placing it in circulation was to retaliate upon Carpenter lor having-had him incarcerated dur ing the Treaty of Washington diillculty. Tho hotel clerk certifies that ho refused Carpenter rooms solely because thoro vero none vacant in the house, and Senator Spencer says that tho corre spondent admitted to him ut Long Branch that thoro was no truth in tho inference to bo drawn from tho telegram which ho sent to the Tribune. On tho other hand, tho Tribune seems per fectly content that it has its case well in hand, and is only anxious to prove tho truth of what it has charged, prom ising to do not only that, but to go further, and show that Carpenter's whole hfohnu boon dis figured by similar practices.
