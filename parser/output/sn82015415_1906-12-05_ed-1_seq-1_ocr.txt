FIGHT WITNESSES TO SHOW EXACTLY DISPUTED PRECINCTS DURING Kaau and another policeman were watching him as ho called out each bal lot. Witness said he did not of his own knowledge fall to read tho namo of Brown on any of the ballots. All of tho ballots wero taken out of the box and I read them. Ludloff kept the tally. To tho knowledgo of tho witness no ballots with four super visors voted ror on them wero counted. Two ballots with marks down the mid dle were counted. Sidney Jackson was among those who had been present. Apakimanawat had asked to see every ballot. Gear refused to admit that Brock the other Inspector would tes tify to the same thing that Austin had done. Sheriff Brown was called by Kinney and questioned as to tho three police men who had been present. He stat ed that nono of them had been sent there to look after his Interests but he presumed they wero loyal to him. Ho supposed that Jim Kuplhea was also loyal to him. Kuplhea was In tho olghth of the fifth. Kinney then asked that tho bags containing tho official tally list ballots voted In the Sth of tho Bth be opened, his purpose being to compare the of ficial tally list of thoso voted with the number of ballots returned by the Inspectors for tho county election. The totals wero found to tally. They were 219. Previous to tho count al lowing the bag to bo opened Gear acting for Brown called attention to tho fact that the envelope was open.

ADMINISTRATOR'S PETITION. A petition by H. M. von Holt for al lowance of accounts and final distribu tion and discharge as administrator of the estate of the late Mrs. Alice Mack intosh, was filed today. CARTER TO SARGENT Governor Carter was a witness be fore Commissioner General Frank P. Sargent this morning, relative to an Inquiry that tho latter Is making into whether tho Portuguese immigrants were In any way coerced by the plan tation Interests Into working on par ticular plantations and whether, the importation of the laborers had1 been done by tho Territorial Board of Im migration In conformity with tho law or whether it had been done by tho plantation interests. "I was questioned by General Sar gent," said Governor Carter today, sheet and the returns In tho legislative election in the 5th precinct of tho fourth district was then opened. Gear called attention to he fact that the envelope bad been torn open. Tho Brown-Iaukea election contest was occupied this afternoon by Kinney comparing tho official tally sheets with the returns made by the inspectors In their count for sheriff. Thero was Ono discrepancy but tho cause of this was satisfactorily lexplalned and nothing sensational or anything that aided Iau kea's cause developed. After a brief argument Kinney rested his case. 3.40 p. m. Argument Is being held In the Supreme Court In regard to addi tional evidence which Attorney Kin ney wishes to introduce relative to bal lots rejected for tho reason that there wero mistakes In regard to the voting for officers other than Sheriff. It Is claimed that more of these ballots favoring Iaukea than favored Brown were thrown out and If Kinney suc ceeds In getting certain of these bal lots counted the count will probably favor Iaukea.

There has been so much dissatisfac tion expressed about town over the outcome of the recent election In which the Supreme Court has counted the election returns different from the Ins pectors that It has started considerable of a movement for tho government to buy and Install voting machines. A number of Iniluentlal men are said to be in favor of tho plan Including A. L. C. Atkinson, Secretary of tho Ter ritory. 'I would like to seo voting machines Installed very much," said the Secre tary this morning, "I believe that It would not only keep out all fraud and dissatisfaction but that It would fur thermore bo cheaper. The machines would cost the government about $500 each and the cost of these would more than be defrayed by three elections on tho outside. "The argument commonly used In opposition to tho Installation of the machines Is the statement that they can bo 'beat. But this Is no longer true. They havo these machines now so that they give the returns correctly and expeditiously. I believe that It would bo a great thing for the gov ernniont hero to have the machines In stalled." "relative to the subscriptions to the fund of tho Immigration board, also as to whether thero had been any restric tions placed upon the Portuguese after they wero landed here and whether there had been any attempt to coerce them In any way from securing the character of work that they desired. Tho purpose of Sargent's Inquiry was to determine whether the Importation of these Portuguese had been carried out by the Territorial Board of Immi gration or whether the planters were (Continued on Pago Five.)

THOUGHT IAUKEA WAS IT. Curtis Iaukea, who does not yet know whether he Is to be Sheriff or not, had occasion to call at the police station this afternoon on a matter of business and Immediately curiosity was arous ed among the ignorant as to whether or not he had come to take charge. One of the officers shook hands with him nnd at oneo his follow officers wanted to know whether or not he had been promised a job.
