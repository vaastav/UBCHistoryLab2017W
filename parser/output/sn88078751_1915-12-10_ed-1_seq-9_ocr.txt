OLLOWING la the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and bouse at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress Since I lost had the privilege, of addressing yon on the state of the Union the wnr - of nations on the other side of the sen. Which bad then only begun to disclose Kb portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope vntil it has swept within its flame Bonie portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own "hemi sphere, has altered tho wholo face of International affairs, and now presents prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart, studiously neu tral. It was our manifest duty to do 0. Not only did we have no part or Interest In the policies which seem to fcave brought the conflict on; it was accessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some part of the great fam ily of nations should keep tho process es of peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the break down throughout the world of the in dustries by which Its populations are fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the self governed nations of this hemisphere to redress, if possi ble, the balance of economic loss and confusion hi the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day of read justment and recuperation we earnest ly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service. ' In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their sep arate life and their habitual detach ment from the politics of Europe, but also by i clear perception of interna tional duty, the states of America have become conscious of a new and more vital community of interest and moral partnership In affairs, more clearly conscious at tho many common sympa thies and interests .and duties which bid them stand together. There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the re publics fighting their way to independ ence in Central and South America when the government of the United States looked upon Itself as in somo ort the guardian of the republics to the south of her as against any en croachments or efforts at political con trol from the other side of the water; felt It Its duty to play the part even without invitation from them, and I think that we can claim that the task was undertaken with a true and disin terested enthusiasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested elf' government of her independent peoples. Rut It was always difficult tn maintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose free dom of action we sought to protect and without provoking serious mis conceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful man of affairs must wel come the altered rircumstiinron nf thn new day In whose light we now stand.1 when there is no claim of guardian ship or thought of wards, but Instead a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors in the interest of all Amer ica, north and south. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America la not altered. We retain unabated tho spirit that has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and Which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make a common cause of national independence and of political liberty in America. But that purpose Is now better understood so far as It concerns ourselves. It Is known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known to have In it no thought of taking advan tage of any government in this hemi sphere or playing Its pqlitlcal fortunes for our own benefit All the govern ments of America, stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genu ine equality and unquestioned inde pendence. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test Whether we-have benefited Mex ico by the course wo have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advan- ( f tago of her in her distress and under lain to impose upon tier an oraer and 1 government of our own choosing. Lib erty is often n fierce and intractable tbinf. to which no bounds can be set and to 'Which no bounds' of a few

President Wilson Reading Message to Congress. men's choosing ought ever to be set Every American who has drunk at tho true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of lights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed aslhe creed of free men. That doc trine is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community;" that "of all the vnrlous modes and forms of government that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness nnd safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an Indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge Itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid aDd be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her, and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. 

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable Vi th in the' Next Generation. The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true scuse a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hos tile rivalries; united in spirit nnd pur pose, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire In it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. A very notable body of men recently met in the city of Washington, at the invitation and as the guests of this government, whose deliberations are likely to be looked back to as marking a memorable turning point in the his tory of America. They wero repre sentative spokesmen of the several In dependent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of theN republics of the two continents which nature and political fortune have so Intimately linked together. I earnestly recommend to your perusal the reports of their proceedings and of the actions of their committees. You will get from them, I think, n fresh conception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which Americans of both continents may draw together In practical co-operation and of what the material foundations, of this hope ful partnership of interest must con sist of how we should build them and MESSAGE Declares That if Full Navy Program Is Garried Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Gomes From Within Our Borders. f how necessary it is thnt we should hasten their building. There is, I venture to point out, an especial significance Just now attach ing to this whole matter of drawing the Americas together In bonds of hon orable partnership and mutual advan tage because of the economic readjust ments which the world must Inevitably witness within the next generation, when peace shall have at last resumed, Its healthful tasks. In the perform ance of these tasks I believe the Amer icas to be destined to play their parts together. I am interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought I cannot find the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my- whole thought as I address you today. I mean national defense. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom wo are appointed to speak can fall to per ceive that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed In the prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are not belligerent They do not seek or desire war. Their thought is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports lifo and the tin censored thought that quickens it Conquest nnd dominion nre not in our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right nnd liberty, wo resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security In prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand It also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty nnd free national development to the inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of Independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are ns necessary in times of peace as in times of war, and we shall always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger than Is nctually and continuous ly needed for the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. Bui we do believe in a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of tho governments which they have set up to serve them. In our constitutions themselves we have commanded that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," and our confidence has been that our safety In times of danger would lie in the rising of the nation to take care of itself, as tho farmers rose at Lexington. SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight' effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and Immediately effective. And the government must be their servant to this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military rm of their government, which they will not allow to direct them, tlicy may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, nnd not their own independence merely, but tho rights nlso of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put In jeopardy. They1 must bo fitted to play the great role in tho world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened nm bitlon to pay,, It is vvltb tliese ideal" In mind that Hie plans of the department of war for morn adequate national defence Vrre conceived which will laid before yon. and V.I1H1 I nre xm to sanction ami put lulu effect iu mwn m (hey ran properly riillnlzed 11 ml discussed. They Becm 111 im iln m '-utlul (Irxt steps, and they seem to ine for the present (sufficient. They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of fi,023 olll curs and 1(I2,!)S." cnliiied men it all services to a strength of 7,130 officers nnd 1111,707 enlisted men, or 141,81.1 all told, all service, rank and flic, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiment of Infantry, four regiments of field nrtlllcry and four ncro squadrons, besides 730 ofilccrs re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently qeak, 702 non commissioned officers for fervlce In drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, tho hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These are tho additions necessary to render the army adequate for Its present du ties, duties which it lias to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our Interior army posts, but ulso in the Philippines. In the Tlawaiian' Island, at the Isth mus and in Porto Itlco. By way of making the country ready to assert some part o'f its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by n force of 400,000 disciplined citi zens, raised in Increments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This It Is proposed to do ,by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of tho country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years nnd to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400,000 men would be pro vided with personal accoutcrmenU as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to bo supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated Intervals at convenient places in association with suitable units oi the regular army. Their period of animal training would not necessarily exceed two months in tho year. It would depend upou the patriotic feeling of tho younger men of the country whether they responded to such a call to service or not It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of the employers of the country wheth er they made it possible for the young er men in their employ to respond un der favorable conditions or not I for one do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young men or of those who give them employment those for whose benefit and protection they would in fact enlist I would look forward to the success of such an ex periment with entire confidence. At least so much by way of prepara tion for defense seems to me to be ab solutely imperative now. We cannot do less.
