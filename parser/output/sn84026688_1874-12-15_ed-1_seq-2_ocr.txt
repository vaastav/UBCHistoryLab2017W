B,—The Herald says: I The message of Grant is a more creditable ! document, huth in point of reasoning anil literary execution limn its predecessors 'from the same source. The President 1 makes it clear enough that in his view the three principal causes which have led to the disastrous defeat ot his parly are pros tration of business, the condition of the Southern Slates,and the unsuccessful ex periment of reformin' l- the civil service. Titk "Timms'’ , considers the President’s views on finance have undergone no change, and his propo- j silion to repeal the legal lend r clause is. sound. The Time* thinks tlie President si | reference to Southern matters is plain ad- I vice, given in kindness and frankness.
