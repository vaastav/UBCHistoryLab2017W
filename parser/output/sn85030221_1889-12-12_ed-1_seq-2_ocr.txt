The Atchison Globe savs sacrehr enough that Igoe, the telegraph opera tor in the Minneapolis Tribune build ing, who remained at work vhen he should have taken to his heels, acted very foolishly. Such te merity is not bravery. After all, we suppose he did not know his danger. Everybody is wonderimr who will be Judge Brewer's successor. Judge Foster would like to get the place, of course, but it is doubtful if his ap pointment by the president would not create an uproar among the prohibi tionists in Kansas. For this reason. the appointment is apt to go to some otner state. KANSAs.ought to be extremely trrate ful to the president. He might have given the vacant sat on the supreme bench to his law partner. Attorney General Miller, '.but he set aside his personal wishes no trifling matter with him and chose a Kansas man for the most exalted position in his power to bestow. Brewer Is no doubt an able iurist. and his appointment one that is very acceptable in Kansas where he has lived so many years. In passing it may not be amiss to say that it is also quite agreeable to the stock speculators and broker, and the railroad magnates of Wall street, for whom he has per formed soma valuable services in the past.

When Sol nn dertakea to rival Ingersoll in ridiculing and deriding biblical characters, it is time ror his friends to look after him. It was a little unfortunate that the man who wanted to succeed the Mind preacher, Milburn, as chaplain of the nouse and got left was a cousin-in-law of the president. And vet it ia hitrhlv o J creditable to theitumanitv and courasre of the few republicans who bolted the caucus nominee, and voted to retain Milburn because they would not take his daily bread from the mouth of blind man, even though it were done for the sake of a relative of the president. Now that the speaker is elected and the president's message and the report oi ia secretary or the treasury given to the public, the next matter of au preme political interest is the organi zation of the committees. This Is one of the most laborious, distracting and generally unpleasant tasks which a Speaker encounters, and yet it is the earliest and most important of all his duties. The committees will hardly be announced many days befor tha middle of he month. Globe Demo crat. So far as bis duties in the senate are concerned, it does not make the slight est difference whether John J. Ingalls is a prohibitionists or an anti-prohibi- tienist. . The only difference is that gives the wolves a chance to howl. The writer of this is a plain citizen, with out any political ambition.and it seems to him that a man who adveitlses ir .. .. jvaiisuj every time his name Is men tioned, and. who is the equal of hii most promising rival in honesty and in austry, ought to be returned to the senate without dignifying the howling oi me nine Jays who are envious him. Atchison Globe. of Massachusetts has had t, fin.uL-. ership ten years, Indiana eight years. Maine, North Carolina and New Jer sey six years each, and Georgia, when Howell Cobb w&s speaker, two years, says the New York World. Twenty four of the states have never furnished a speaker, and we have-never had a speaker west of Indiana. Henry Clay was tha youngest speaker in point of age and term of service ia the bouse. Ha was elected when he was only 32 years old, and held the neVpr'. longer than any other speaker. He was re-elected five times and he re signed more than ance. If lteed could carry out the policy of Clay, the party would lose nothing by having him in the chair. Clay did not let his speak ership office prevent him from taking part la the debates, and he was one of the most frequent speakers in congress during his term as presiding officer. A Kansas City judge has decided that the $1,000 blown in by the city council in entertaining the Pan-Amer ican tourists some time ago was wrong fully appropriated by that body, and must 'be replaced. Of coarse the hat will be passed around, and the "penny famine" will grow more pinching. Are women wise in asking for the ballot, and the offices? Only the srood looking ones could be elected. A homely woman would have no show whatever for an office, when the ad mirers of aome charmer could put their idol on the track, and prove the depth and ardor of their affection for her by the energy with which they skirmished around and procured votes f er her. In no time there would be an uproar among the old maids and the homely women to undo the whole thing, and let men do the voting and office-holding. It is very well for demagogues and jay politicians like Funston and ethers to prate about "extending the benefits of the tariff to the farmer," for noone pays any attention to such fol de rol, but when the president admitted such clap trap into his message, he dishon ored that document by tainting it with the vilest demagoguery, and the silliest flapdoodle. Besides, the western farm er believes, or the majority of him does, that he is already protected; how, he does not know, but it is done some how. "Cap'n Pumpernickel" told him all about it when be "heerd him make a speech down to the school haouse.' Therefore, it must be so. Now, why disturb such blissful ignorance by inti mating that the farmer is not, but should be protected? Where is the statesmanship in such blundering bosh? The suggestion in the president's message that the benefits of protection should be extended to the farmer, is tantamount to a confession that the farmer does not now. and of course never has enjoyed such protection; that he has hitherto been, ignored, and his -interests disregarded, while con gressmen were falling over each other in their eagerness to pander to the wishes of the manufacturers. It nec essarily follows from this that the far mer has been deceived all these years. during which time he was duped by his protectionist friends into believing that be was enjoying his share of the benefits of protection, when he was not. Now when evidences becrin to multiply that the farmer is gradually being undeceived, the cry is raised, "let the farmer be protected 1" Yes, but how? Will the Emporia Repub lican say? If there be any way to do so fairly and efficiently, the Lord knows, no sane man would say nay to it, for if any one needs help, it is the farmer, upon whom all oli2r thrive, grow or fatten. The Republicans in the Colorado legislature have hit on a scheme to break the deadlock in the senate. In looking about them for means to get around the present embarrassing situ ation, they found that a Democratic senator, McNamara of Fergus county is inelegible, because his home is on an Indian reservation in that county. This idea had not occurred to anybody before now. The defeated candidate never dreamed it, until the managers brought him down to Helena to act as a dummy in their behalf. 'McNamara and all the citizens on the reservation have been for years voting and holding office, and no one ever dreamed before that they were not citizens of the state. Watson, the contestant, has no certifi cate, but that makes no difference. He will be admitted and the senate organ ized. The work of electing two United States senators may then be taken up. It makes very little difference whether the governor takes any notice of the proceedings of the legislature or not. Bills may be sent to him for his signa ture, and after the usual time elapses, if not signed by him, will become laws ipso facto. This looks a good deal like shoving the limit, and overdoing the rump business that is, if the scheme is carried out, as now seems probable. A more decent method to undo the existing muddle is to compromise, and anow each party a senator. "Mahone of Virginia" no longer registers in that way. He sets himself down in this style on the hotel book "General William Mahone, Peters burg,! a." But he is the same old. Mahone. He will not live at hotels any more, but has established himself in Washington with Mrs. Mahone, in a handsome and elegantly furnished house on Connecticut avenue. Here his family , will be launched Into offi cial Bociety, while Mahone is playing poker and drinking mint juleps with his cronifts of the national Republican committee. He laughs skeptically when asked whether President Harri son will direct the alt ornev general to prosecute his friends in ths Old Do minion Republicau League who broke the law against political assessments for M.ihone's benefit just before elec tion. Mahou9 thinks that v Harrison win pay no attention to the report of the civil service commission on this law-breaking so painstakingly pre pared by that "fresh young man" "Teddy" Roosevelt, which he has had now nearly two weeks. Mahone is against all reforms on principle, and he doesn'C see how any practical poli tician, such as he is willing to concede Harrison to be since the patronage of Virginia was turned over to him, can differ with him. Between drinks and games Mahone will continue to distri bute patronage at the old stand and to his old customers. St. Louis Republic. One, and perhaps the greatest trouble with prohibition is. that the fellows who say most about it. who talk loudest for it, and hurl the dirtiest epithets at whisky drink ers, are drinkers themselves, and fre quently indulge in revels that would do honor to Bacchus himself. Such apostles would damage any cause, no matter how worthy it may be. When the Hutchinson News snters the arena as a champion of the cause, its enemies answer its editor by flinging his bibu lous habits in his face, and sneering contemptuously at his hypocritical pro fessions. Does he grow furiously in dignant and give them the lie in the throat as deep as to thelunes? Not much. The inference from his silence la easy enough and perfectly natural. Such men may bray themselves hoarse over the loveliness of prohibition, but as long as their own lives and habits give the lie direct to their vociferous professions, they do the cause more harm than good, by invoking upon it the ridicule and derision of those op posed to It. It can never prosper as long as shams, frauds and hypocrites are its chief mouth-pieces, organs, ad vocates and defenders. There are no hypocrites among anti-prohibitlonLsts, a circumstance that may account for their success int so many states this year- - . .- . . , . i Congressman Pkskxns has taken to letter writing. He indites a very pretty epistle to the editor ot tha Par sons Sun, in which he declars that he was among the first to advocate years ago the adoption of prohibition, but such has been the rancor and unreason able kicking and clamoring of the rad ical third party prohibitionists, that in yhis opinion, if the matter was resub mitted to to the people, prohibition would be discarded, sat down an and beaten. "This" says he. "ia my hon est judgement, and if in confessing it or stating it, I have committed any crime, I suppose I must be held res ponsible for the consequences. The overwhelming majority against prohi bition in Pensyivania, and the change of public sentiment in Massachusetts and Bhode Island. and in many sections of the country, in my judgment is more the result of the par tisan, bigoted and intolerant spirit manifested by the third party prohi bitionists than of all else combined. While I frankly stated at Wichita that I was not in favor of resubmission and did not believe that the legislature would be convened for the purpose of submitting the question to fhe people of the state, yet I did suggest to some how in my judgment, the question could bemanaged next year so u to give to the people of the several legis lative districts an opportunity of ex pressing their convictions upon the subject without hurting the republi can party particularly in the cam- paign.' To bring into bolder relief the genius and able generalship of Stanley, the Globe-Democrat makes the following comparison: "The legions led by the successors of Cyrus across the burning plains of the Tigris, as well as those conducted by Ney over the frozen steppes of Russia, were disciplined troops, accustomed to act in concert, to obey the orders of the men who commanded them, and to the use of the weapons with which they fought. All were veteran soldiers whose brav ery had been shown on a dozen battle field), while those commanded by Stan ley were the opposite in all these re spects. The Greeks and the French, too, traveled through countries which, however inhospitable they may have been to them, had some of the ele ments of civilization, and the routes through them were tolerably well known. It was Stanley himsel wno was tne inspiration or the raw, timid and treacherous African levies which he commanded. A large part of the 2000 mile 3 which he traversed in his successive marches between the Congo. Aruwhimi and the Nyanzas was through a region never previously trod den by the foot of a man of the Cauca sian race. In much of this course he contended not only with the physical difficulties which swamps and the dense undergrowth of tropical vegetation in terposed, but with hostile natives and the fatalities of the climate. Death confronted him in a dozen shapes, and all this peril was braved not for con quest or revenge, but in the service of science and humanity. HOW 

COXGBESS RECEIVED THE MESSAGE. The following interesting and graph ic description of the manner in which the reading of the president's message was received by the house, is taken from the Globe-Democrat's Washing ton correspondence. It says: Clerk Pettit began to read it. At first the members paid strict attention, but as the readinz proceeded they seemed to lose all interest. The hum of conversation almost drowned the voice of the clerk. Members were standing at their desks in errouns laughing and talking, and at times the confusion was almost deafening. At odd moments the speaker rapped for order. But at no time did anyone ap parently Lear the reading. There was no applause and no laughter. The re ception of this message contrasted stronsrly with the reception- accorded President Cleveland's celebrated tariff message two years ago. Rather complimentary that, to Cleve land. No how was it in the senate? What does the Globe say about its re ception there? Surely the erave and reverend seisnors of that body were in more appreciative mood. Let us see. The Globe correspondent writes con cerning them as follows: Senator Reagan of Texas seemed at first to be the most interested in its contents, lie leaned anxiously for ward, put one hand behind his ear and was intent on catching every word. lie soon reiapsea, however, and looked as ii ne was very arowsy. Senator Vance of North Carolina continued to write letters. Senator Hiscock of New York ran bis fingers through his hair, looked dreamily at the secretary, and then turned to bis mail. Senator Allison of lowa let his eyes wander about the hall and appeared as if he was perfectly content with him- seu ana ail the world. The great Quay, the only senator wno. wears a gray suit on tne Ben ate floor, looked as if be knew every word of it. He was bo confident of it that he retired to a lounge to hold a confer ence with Congressman Darunirton. The solid and substantial Senator sawyer of Wisconsin stroked his beard ana gazed hard at the ceilinsr. The Republican leader. Senator Ed munds, of Vermont sank down into bis chair and began to curl the ends of nis oeara arouna his nngers. Senator Sherman of Ohio folded his hand in his lap and his intellectual face never lighted up but once. That was when the message alluded to the silver question. He seemed to be much more engrossed in the actions of Congressman Seney. who had iust en tered the room. The congressman is a candidate for senator, and good judges of political ability say he will- be elected. Senator Chandler of New Hampshire left his seat and went to the clerk's desh, where he could hear every word, ana ne iouowea secretary JUcUoofc'i every act with bis eyes. Senators Vest of Missouri. Voor hees of Indiana, Beck of Kentucky, ana iioar or .Massachusetts, baa a con rerence aooui something, ihev were deeply engrossed in it around Voor- hees desk, and the major part of the message was lost to them. When that portion which alluded to the tariff was reached several of the senators brightened up and attempted to listen. The effort was too much, and the somnolent condition soon ob tained. "Somnolent, everybody made som nolent by the reading of the message! To be "somnolent," the dictionaries say, is to be "sleepy," drowsy," "inclined to sleep," etc. In other words, the mes sage had the same soothing and tran quilizing effect upon the members of both houses that paregoric has on in fants! After all, how much better that ia than a message that would stir up men's blood and breed bitterness and strife. It is therefore pleasing to know that it had a healthful effect on congressmen, for sleep is healthful. And whatever conduces to it, or pro motes it, is wholesome and life-giving. From a pathological or hygienic stand point the message must be declared to be wonderfully successful. 

WHEN .Cy Leland thinks, of Col. Jewett'a fate as a hopeful rand hi at for the Kansas City postoffice,. this un accountable delay in issuing his com missison wraps him. like Jacauea. tn most humorous saisesi, Senator Plumb has introduced an other bill for a 1100,000 public building in this city, if we don't get it this time, we must conclude that congress has it in for Emporia.'

Hallowell and General Campbell? Thkt complain at Atchison that the town is as dull when Ingalls is at Washington, as is Lawrence when school vacation sets in. That does not mean, we hope, that thev would Drefer to have him with them always. Chief Justice Horton and Judge Foster are both talked of as probable successors of Judge Brewer. Either would fill the bill admirably, but can the president be worked for two impor tant appointments for Kansas? Senator Ingalls not only favors Atchison as the nroner site for the World's fair, but has introduced a bill giving her a $100,000 court house. These important facta are resnectfullv referred to the Empori-t Republican. America on top again. Mrs Mackay has compelled the English paper that called her a washerwoman, to retract and apologize.and the world of fashion wherein she figured so prominent ly is once more happy. . She a washerwoman! The ideal McKinley will be made chairman of the ways and means committee, if present predictions are well based, al though the west would prefer Joe Can non of Illinois. But as we have re marked before, the west is not getting the earth this year. The Kansas City Times began two or three weeks ago the running of an early Sunday morning train to distrib ute papers throughout Kansas. Now the Journal and Globe will follow with another. The next step we suppose will be the issuing of Monday morning papers by our Kansas contemporaries, and further desecrating the Sabbath. 'Tis truly a wicked world. It is said by the frontiermen that the coyote has a most marvelous faculty of magnifying himself during the small hours of the night and creating an ear splitting impression that he is an in numerable, multitude. Our anti-In- galls republican neighbor on Sixth avenue evidently remembers his coyote experiences; but then, Ingalls is an old settler also. "A young man called Wanamaker, a relative of the postmaster general asked for the postoffice at Chillicothe, Ohio. "No," said the postmaster gen eral, "under no circumstances, will I appoint a relative to any office." Good io r John! But what will the presi dent think of such Spartan firmness? A Boston capitalist tells a reporter that Kansas ,f arm mortgages are con sidered admirable investments; that "the security is adequate and the in vestment sound." This seems to be satisfactory from a capitalist's stand point, and as the Kansas farmers are satisfied with a public policy which encourages mortgages, there ought to be general good feeling and content ment. K. C. Star. - Judge Dcster of Marion has made a decison that in foreclosing a mort gage the mortgagee cannot directly or indirectjy become the purchaser of the mortgaged property. This will block the game of a good many Kansas Shy- locks who loaned money f or the express purpose of "wolfing" their debtors. Burlington Independent. An attempt is being made to credit Senator Plumb with the appointment of Judge Brewer to the United States supreme court. It is probable that Kansas men bad very little to do with it; Brewer's "backing" probably came from his uncles, Cyrus "W., David Dudley and Stephen J. Field. It has always been understood in Kansas that they secured his appointment to the circuit court. Atchison Globe. The Emporia News talks of protec tion to farmers in a wav to convey the impression that it knows very little about the subject. If Mr. O'Connor will consult the tariff schedules he will find that the farmer's most important products are protected by customs du ties. -t-mpona itepublican. Just so. And what are they worth? The best thing that can be said in fa vor of such protection is, that Kansas "most important product," corn, is now doing duty as a cheap article of fuel- "A temporary device" is what the- Globe-Democrat calls the scheme to give subsidies to ocean ship ping, ies, we know something about these temporary devices. The tariff was to be a "temporary de vice" also, when fixed at its present high rate about twenty-seven years ago, and still it is with us, and, like the poor, would stay always. Better let such "temporary devices" alone, especially when they are resorted to for the purpose of enabling such people as Gould, Huntington and the Cramps to make more millions. There is mourning in the south over Jeff Davis, and the eulogies and fun eral orations that will be uttered over the dead chief mty sound a trifle strange to people of the north, but. rightly considered, they should not be wondered at. He was their hero, who rose, reigned and fell with them. Must they desert him when thebal lance of the world frowned on him? They would earn the contempt of all right thinking people in the north if theys hould do bo. Let them pro nounce their eulogies in peace.' The war is over, and whatever ardor of af fection or extravagance of praise may be bestowed upon the dead chief, can harm no one at the north, and ought not to provoke-any ungenerous feeling towards the people of the south. The indications are favorable for a union of the Knights of Labor and eth Farmers' aad Laborers' union. Steps are being taken by committees of both organizations to that end, which if consummated.will present to the coun try a united body of three to four mil lions of farmers and laborers. Such an enormous body of voters if properly welded into an organic whole, would have the power to control the politics and the legislation of the' country. could take trusts and combines by the throat and wring the life nut of them as well as out of of. their defenders and abettors in congress. It would have the power, as it hs or would have the disposition, to do a great many useful and needful things. The query re mains, can a body so vast in numbers be organized and held together long enough to accomplish any of these tilings.' . Do von h ata dvanpntta tranMM?

Among th numerous memorials and petition! presented in the Senate yesterday wai fine signed by D. E. Webster, asking that the National title be changed to that of "The United States of Colum. bia." . Among the bills introdured and re ferred were the following: To limit the jurisdiction of ths circuit and district courts of the United States. For the retirement of United States legal tender and National bank notes of small denominations, and the issue of coin certificates in lieu of gold and silver certificates; also to repeal the laws relating to the sinking fund. Proposing a constitutional amend ment to confer on the District of Columbia representation in both Houses of Congress and in the Electoral College. To amend the naturalization laws. To give the right of trial by jury to claimants for pension. To aid and secure the commemora tion of the 400th anniversary of the dis covery of America. To amend the laws relating to the removal of cases from State courts to United States courts. Senator Voorhees offered a long pre amble and resolutions in reference to tariff taxation, which he asked to have laid upon the table for the present. It declared that all existing tariff taxes on foreign merchandise should be so revised, repealed or amended, as to provide: Flret For tbe collection of a aulBdent amount of revenue to pay the expenses of government economically administered ; the principal and interest of the public debt as they fall due, and liberal pensions, but not a dollar more. Second For the taxation of all articles of luxury at the highest practicable rates, and for the reduction of taxes on all necessaries of civilised life, such as salt, sugar, woolen goods, Iron, steel and other staple commodi ties, to the lowest possible rates consistent with a tariff for revenue and for nothing but revenue.

Tha Clerks of Appropriation Committees snow Greater Revenues and- Expenses Than the Secretary of the Treasury. Washington, Dec. 5. The clerks of the Committees ou Appropriations ol the Senate and House have prepared a comparative statement of estimates. appropriations and expenditures for the maintenance of the Government for the fiscal years 1890 and 1891, from wmcn it appears that the net in crease of the estimates for 1S91 over those for the current year is $20,867,168 and the net increase of the estimates for the next year over the appro priation ror tins year is $38,092,112. The total estimates of regular and per manent annual appropriations for the next fiscal year are $406,843,415, while the total revenues are estimated at $450,414,337 an excess of estimated revenues over estimated appropriations next year of $43,571,022. The net sur plus for the present year is placed at $53,532,411 or $9,961,489 more than the estimated surplus for the next fiscal year. This prospective decrease in the surplus is stated too without reference to the possibility of the enactment of a Eiver and Harbor bill, for in the esti mates submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury there is a notable omission of the ordinary provision for river and harbor improvements. For the preserv ation of existing works the sum of $237,000 is asked, while the report of the chief of engineers says that $38, 632,550 can be profitably expended next year In these improvements. The statement above quoted differs materially from that prepared from the Treasury Department and exhibited in the book of estimates just issued, for tbe reason that the postal receipts and revenues are differently treated by the treasury and the Appropriation Com mittees. Killed In His Barn. Pratt, Kan., Dec. 5. W. W. Smith, a prominent and well-to-do farmer. was killed at an early hour yesterday morning in his barn, six miles north east of here. He was shelling corn, and was shot three times from behind. His son-in-law, Charles Young, was in the barn at the time. Young says that while he was water ing stock he saw a man talking to Smith and then heard shots. He ran to the house to geta gun, and saw no more of the mysterious man. Young's story is not altogether straight. Smith was known to have had no difficulty with any one previously. "Labor" Train In ColIUlou. Wilkesbarke, Pa., Dec. 5.
