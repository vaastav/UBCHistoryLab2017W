IT SENATOR RAYNOR Congress nor Treaty Can Violate Rights of a State. Jfek latercst Taken by Senators in Mr. Rayner's Speech on Japanese Question The Speaker QnotetJ Many Authorities in Support of IDs Contention Wanted to Know the Hxact Power of the President in the Matter. Washington, December 12. Much in terest was manifested in the senate on tiie position taken by Senator Ray net to bis discussion today of the Japanese question. He contended that the in liarent riat of a state could not be TJotatod by treaty any more than they could be violated by congress. To sup jport this he cited many adjudicated esses before the supreme court and ar rayed long lines of eminent authorities iMr. Rayner also gave the cases and authorities for the other-side of the TropositIo. Caustic criticism of President Roose velt's position on the Japanese question prefaced Mr. Rayner's speech. II the Military and civil forces of the federal gforernment were to be used by the Tireeddent, Mr. Rayner said it becomes t,btj important to know the exact lower of the president in the matter. "Because", he added, "it is quite a se rious matter, in view of the great calamity that has lately befallen the ity of San Francisco for the president io contemplate the bombarding the fty at this time, and to declare war against the bxirds of county school trustees of California, if there is no justification or pretext upon which such j Hfcrociou3 proceedings can be under- I taken. The president is exercising it j great many functions executive, leg- I Islative and judicial, lawful and unlaw- ful, constitutional and unconstitutional If he is possessed the idea that he ia the supervisor of all of the public schools of the various states of the anion, and he seems to be impressed With the idea, because in the last paragraph of his message he recom mends to congress the establishment f shooting galleries ia all of the large schools of the country, w must either disabuse his mind of this fancy or we saust let him Know that we agree with film aa to the omnipotence of his juris diction. If he can take possession of the public schools of California and compel the state to admit to them Japanese students contrary to the laws of California he could with equal pro priety send us an amendment to the Santo Domingo treaty and demand 1he admission oi the negro children o Santo Domingo into the white schools of South Carolina or of any other state of the union." Mr. Rayner coincided with what the president said in his message in pvaiss of the Japanese. His sympathies had, he said, been with them during their war with Russia, and he thought it a great sham that Japanese should have been overpowered in the conference room when she had been vlctorfous in battle. He proposed, he said, to discuss the present question entirely outside the particular circumstances, and plant fcimself on these two propositions: , "1. That there is no provision what ver in the treaty with Japan that Confers the right that the president ' speaks of, or gives to the government of Japan the privileges that it claims itt connection with the public school system of California or of any other . state. "2. If there vra3 such a provision in . this treaty, or any other treaty con ferring this right, the treaty would be void and without any authority upon the part of the United States to mate it and in violation of the constitution and the treaty making power of the government." There were, he said, two distinct .schools of -thought on the question: One holding that the treaty making power is an inherent element of sover eigntv, the other, that this power ex ists for the purpose of carrying ouc the objects of government as prescribed and defined by the constitution and irhat no treaty is valid that violates the constitution or that surrenders the rights reserved to the states. Mr. Ray ner said he was a disciple of the latter school. The precise point involved, he ' said, was the tenth article of the con stitution: That powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution mior prohibited to it by the states, are reserved to the "states respectively or 4o the people". . , Continuing, Mr. Rayner said: "The power of a state to regulate its public school system is clearly among its reserved powers. Have we, there fore a right to provide in a treaty that the Christians of foreign lands shall possess privileges in the public sckooia of the states that are prohibited either by the constitution or by the laws in the state in which they are claimed? If we can. in defiance of the laws and constitution of a state, incorporate in a treaty so as to bind the state, then we can undoubtedly deprive the stale of every reserved right that it pos sesses, and rescind and annul its laws and 11 ts constitution whenever they come in conflict with the treaty mak ing power. I trample upon this appall ing doctrine. If ever such a deformity as this should weep into our judicial decisions it would disfigure the consti tution to such an extent that its feat ures would no longer be capable of re cognition. It would annul the charter, it would frustrate the intention of the men who framed it; it would under mine the entire framework of the i strument, and it would convert us from a constitutional government into a dictatorship, with th? states in abject servitude to federal power and with the executive in practical control of the destinies of the republic."

PLAT NTS 31 ABE The Murphj Branch of the Southern Railway Represented to be in Bad Condition. (Special to The Mescanger.) Raleigh, N. C, Dec. 12. Specifis com plaints against the Murphy branch of the Southern railway having been made by the Asheville Lumber Exchange, C. H. Hobbs, of Asheville, "and Dr. Ixmis Wilson, of Chapel Hill, the corporation committee, made an inspection of the line. This was made by Commissioner Rogers a year ago, at which time they promised improvements, but practically none have been made. The physical condition is bad and the lives of pas sengers are endangered by steep grades, sharp curves, short banks, 'light rails and many defective ties. In fourteen days there were twenty derailments. There is only one track man to each two miles of road. The train service inadequate, only half the necessary cars being supplied. There are seven hundred pasesngers daily. Trains arived late 77 out of 81 time. There is a deliberate and un reasonable daily assignment of crip pled, wornout and powerless engines, no regard for schedules, the service intol erable. The commission orders the Southern to show cause why it is not liable for penalties for failure to fur nish cars. The power of the commis sion to enforce schedules, have safe road bed and require conveniences in general, is limited, and it will consider these subjects in its recommendations to the legislature.

DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. Judge and District Attorney Vary ia Their Construction of the Rate Law Chicago, Dec. 12. District Attorney Sims resumed today before Judge K. M. Landis, his arguments in answer to the demurrer of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana to the indictments chargiug the company with accepting conces sions from railway companies in viola tion of federal laws. The argument brought out a difference of opinion be tween the district attorney and Judge Landis regarding the ground covered by the rate law and a like difference of opinion regarding the moment at which an act of congress becomes a law. In speaking of the rate law, Judge Landis said that he had never seen the rate law, but from impressions gather ed from articles published in news papers at the time the law was passed he had the idea that the rate law took the place of all previous interstate reg ulations.

SEiTECOHFIBHSIiOHIOIlTIOijWILl REDUCE RATE OF SPEED Opposition to Moody and Bona-! parte Hot Strongly Pressed. ONLY FEW VOTES IX NEGAGTIVE. Opposition Against Moody and Bona- parte I.ed by Senators Culbersoa and Carmack Bonaparte's Attitude on Trusts vks the Cause of Senti ment Against Him. Washington, Dec. 12 Tbe senate to: day confirmed the nominations cf Wil liam H. Moody of Massachusetts to be an associate justice of the supreme court of the United States, Charles J. Bonaparte, of Maryland to be attorney general, Victor II. Metcalf, of Califor nia, to be secretary of the navy, and Oscar S. Straus of New York to be sec retary of commerce and labor. The opposition to Messrs. Moody and Bonaparte which had been raised in the senate by a number oi democratic sena tors was not strongly pressed at the session today and no roil was asked for. On the viva voce vote for Mr. Bonaparte, however, there were a num ber of negative votes on the minority side, estimated at about 15. Cul berson and Carmack led the discussion against both Mr. Moody and Mr. Bona parte. AgainstJ the former they raised a question of hfa fitness for the su preme court bench based upon meas ures he had introduced as a member of the house. It was again urged against Mr. Bona parte that his utterances against legis lation for the regulation of combina tions of capital unfitted him to enforce 1 legislation of that character. Senator Lodge defended the nomination of Mr. Bonaparte by saying that the president would not name a man for the respon sible position of attorney general un less he was sure that' the nominee was in sympathy with the administration's desire to break up such combinations. There was no opposition to either Mr. Metcalf or Mr. Straus. Attorney General Moody will, if con firmed, be sworn in as associate justice of the supreme court on December 24. The other cabinet changes consequent upon the retirement of Mr. Moody will follow immediately Secretary Bona parte, becoming attorney general and. Secretary Metcalf assuming the posi tion of secretary of the navy. "It is the present intention to have Mr. Cortelyou take charge of the treas-. ury port folio on March 4." said Sena tor Aldrich whq talked .with thei presi dent this morning about Mr. Crtelyou'a nomination to be secretary of tha (treasury which was held up yesterday because no date was specified as to when the apointment became effec tive. The same formal objection, it is said, applied to other nominations be fore the senate, notably that of James R. Garfield to be secretary cf the in terior. It has been customary hereto fore, the senate said to specifically in dicate the date upon which such ap pointments are to take effect and its omission in the present case aparent iy was an oversight.

Crondcd Condition of Single Track Lines and Double Track Work the Cause President Finlcy Believe the Public Will be Satisfied With, the Change Operating Division to Ie Shortened. Washington, Dec. 12. It. is learned from President Finley of the Southern Railway Company, that owing to the crowded condition of some of its single track lines, and the double track work, including the revision of grades and alignment, now under way- for the pur pose of relieving the crowded condtion of the present single track, the South ern Railway Company finds it difficult to maintain the schedule of some of its passenger trains, as now scheduled, and uv. t iu Cell i j ;cL L LI January ensuing revise these schedules putting them on the basis of slower speed, with the expectotion of being able to maintain them, and believing that under the circumstances this ar rangement will be more satisfactory to the public. In this connection Presi dent Finley says: "The double track work is being vigorously pushed, and on other sections of the road where double track work is not now under way, but where traffic is heavy, passing tracks are being put in, and those al ready in extended, in order to facili tate the movement of trains, all such passing track work being done with the ultimate object of utilizing it as double track when double track work may be undertaken in these local ities. "The improvement in passenger train movement will naturally improve the movement of freight trains. 'The Southern Railway Company is arranging to shorten its operating divisions, increasing the number from 14 to 27, each one of these divisions to be in charge of a superintendent. Men now in the districts will be promoted to the additional positions thus created. This arrangement, it is believed will result ia increased efficiency, and will, it is farther believed, promote the mu itual interest of the public and the com pany.

TUB 1IARTJE DIVORCE SUIT Judo DecMcs la Favor of the Wife. Children win Remain With Their Mother Entire Oost of Proceed ings Placed on Ifartje The Case Uvr Most Sensational One Ever Tried ! Pittsbnrg. Pittsburg, December 12. Judge Rob ert S. Fraser handed down his decision ia the famous Hartje divorce case this afternoon. The petition of Augustus Hartje, the multi-miUJLonairo paper manufacturer for a divorce from his wife, Mrs. Mary Scott Hartje, who he charged with intimacy with Thomas Madine, a former coachman is inclu sive, the decision Kays and in substanti ation of this inclusiveuess, Judgf Fraser cites the following points: The servants stories of Mrs. Hartje's wrong doing ore quite different than those based in Mr. Hartje's etitioa. The story of Susie . Wagner, a maid, was grossly exaggerated and built up; Mrs. Hartje, perhaps, visited the stable too often, but her fondness for borse sufficiently explains what might be con sidered an mdifcieretion. The letters introduced are open to suspicion and are conclusive of nothing. Experts testimony is of little value. The steal ing of the said letters from Madine's rooms as testified to, shows those who produced them to be lawbreakers. The preponderance of testimony shows the letters were not in Mrs, Hartje's hanl writing, and at the trial Hartje aban doned all his charges except the cne relating to Madine. The decision does not refer to the question of alimony but Mrs. Hartje has a motion pending in court for the granting of alimony. The two children, Mary Louise Hartje and John Scott Hartje, will remain with their mother. The entire cost of the proceedings are placed on Mr. Hartje, and the 6uit for divorce filed by his wife will be tried when it Is reported in the regular order." Mr. Hartje announced that he wouid take an appeal. The divorce case was the most sen sational ever tried in this city. The wealth and prominence of the princi pals; the ugly charges alleged, and later, after the trial had begun, ad ditional charges against Mrs. Hartje, in coimection with a second coachman, Clifford Hooe, a negro, tended to make the case sensational in the extreme. Following the Introduction of the Hooe incident Mr. Hartje and a business friend, John S. Welsohns, together with Clifford Hooe, the negro, were all arrested on a charge of conspiracy. Hooe was also charged with perjury, was convicted, and is now awaiting a new trial. ITS DOORS CLOSED. Farmers and Drovers National Bank, of Wayncsburg, Ia.. Goes Into the Hands of Receiver. Washington, Dec. 12. The Farmem and Drovers National Bank of Waynes burg, Pa., was closed today by direc tion of the comptroller of the currency, and National Bank Examiner John B. Cunningham has been appointed re ceiver. . A statement issued by the comptroll er of the currency says that the bank has been in an unsatisfactory condi tion for eome time, and that its lawful money reserve has been continuously deficient notwithstanding repeated ai m on it ions and an official notice to make it good. The statement say a: "Its liabilities for re-discounts Lave largely exceeded the amount of its capital stock in violation of law and in disregard of the comptrollers repeated instructions to reduce such liabilitios to lawful limits. The examiner has dis covered that those re-diseounta aro sev eral hxmdred thousand dollars greater than the amount shown by its books and reports to the comptroller. The books and sworn reports of condition have been found by the examiner to be so falsified. as to be wholly unreliable. Its checks and drafts have been recent ly dishonored and the general condi tion of the bank is such as to warrant an assumption of Insolvency and t justify the comptroller in closing : doors." The bank had a capita! of 5200,00 ;. and the last statement of the reiour.-f and liabilities made to the comptroller showed totals of $2,367,474 respe.-.tlveiy. POLICY HOLDERS MEET. C. F.
