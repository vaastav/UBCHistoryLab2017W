Tho President's Message elicits the usual variety of comments from the .N'cw York city press. The Tribune is not satisfied with it. Tho Herald re gards it as a " conclusive vindication of his course." The New A* welcomes it as placing the President "in direct opposi tion to the foolish and vindictive policy of the Republicans, as developed by the representatives of that party in Con gress." The H'oWf-luis not-made up its mind. The Times regards its views us "full of wisdom uud conveyed with great force und dignity ;" but 1 hen the Timts would have said the same thing If Hie Message had been delivered in Clioclusv. The Journal of Commerce pronounces it "able und vigorous/ and dcslinedto "lake rank among the noble documents of our history." The Even ing Post finds it "frank, dignified, direct and manly." We believe there are one or two other duilies, but we for get their names just nosy. THE 

MESSAGE AND THK .KITICS According to the correspondent of the President, lolihson excites v grout degree of surprise, in Washington, both for whal it contains and what it omits, ami "the southern members of Congress are disappointed, because their claims to their sealsare not plainly and nii.iiuivo cally staled." Tho correspondent thinks it a hardship that "the ni'ssue leaves the whole matter to Congress, and iLis regarded, therefore, as a virtual ac*|iiiesoence in tlie Stunner and Ste vens programme for the permanent ex clusion of the southern members." Such is tho slatomentof the corespond ent of a journal, the highest aspiration of Avhieli it seems to be, to misrepresent llio intentions of the government and the purposes of the northern people to the South, ft is an unfair deduction of the message and a false interpretation of Mr. Johnson's future motives. In our judgment, tlie President is explicit upon every subject in the message, anil can be easily understood by all fair-miude.l critics. He recounts tlie advances that have been nmde to induce tho south ern people to return to their allegiance, and then says—"it is not too much to ask, in the name of the wholo people, that, -A the one side, the plan of restor ation shall proceed in conformity with a willingness to cast the disorder of the past in tIP oblivion; und that, on the other, the evidence of sincerity in the fiitiirn maintenance of the Union shall lie put beyond any doubt by tho ratifi cation of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, which provides for the abolition of slavery forever within the limits of our country. So long as the, tidoj.tion of this amendment is delayed, along will doubt ami jealousy, and 'c.rtaintyprevail. This Is Ihe measure icli will cflu-e Hie sad memory of the past: this is the measure which will most certainly call population, and cap ital, and security lo those parts of the Cnion -«_hiit need them most." This, of itself, should be sufficient ex- planation to those " soutliern niembers of Congress " alluded to. But the Pres ident goes oii.usif anticipating just such crilicisni, and after observing that it in not too much to ask of tho States which are now resuming their places in the family of the Union to give their pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace, asserts in a sentence full of moaning, that "un til it i.s done, the past, however much Wo may desire it, will not be forgotten." No BUM could have addressed the sonth «*rn feeling, the southern pride, or paid inoro deference to the natural sen- ,le sihililies of a liefcated parly, with er inure consideration than th*. Presi li- dent has done, and it is unjust to deny hi this merit in his message. Wo have no *_. doubt, that "the southern members of er Congress are disappointed;" hut we are tv not induced to this belief because the 11, AY...,; says so; for it is the habit of that >n journal to droit, southern grievances •y when none exist, and inugnify common political hardships of the South into :icts of wilful and studied tyranny. The 'I admission of gentlemen from the South >' into Congress is not the thing she needs ' H niosl. She needs capilal and labor just. 1, nosy, to develop.* her resources, much '• Inure than she does the elevation or bro il ferment of a parcel of bankrupt politi n ciaiiH. It would have beta more iligni " lied in the South to have been patient, 1 and mil to have struggled for the seats '11 icy \: waled. -i-.- ■ - . . .___ MUX I CO. - .'i.RlfE.
