Appeals from Commercial Bodies and v.. Others to Exempt Engineers anil Other Officers Is Unheeded—Must Take Regular Practice Marches. The war department Thursday pub lished a general order extending Its original orders relative to riding tests of officers of the army. The president row requires every Held officer to make a dally practice march of not less than thirty miles for three days in succession each year. All officers are Also required to accompany their com mands on the monthly practics marches. The advanced stand taken by the president in the matter of physically testing the condition of officers of the army, in the face of strong pressure from commercial bodies throughout the country in favor of the retention in service of engineers and other staff officers, who, though perfectly com petent to discharge their ordinary du ties, would probably be unable to re rpond to the demands of active cam paign service, has filled with appre hension a number of senior officers of grades between captain and colonel, inclusive. Because the -president in his original letter directing the riding test referred only to officers, it was in some quar ters believed that he might be willing to waive the application of such test to staff officers, whose duties in lime of peace do not carry them into the field. In his message to congress just delivered the president Indicated, however, a contrary purpose, and the order published Thursday exceeds in Eaverity the test originally proposed, and will probably be the means of causing the summary retirement from the army of a considerable number of officers.

FAILURE IX KANSAS CITY. .Rational Bank of Commerce Closes Its Doors. The National Bank of Commerce at Kansas City, Mo., failed to open its doors Thursday morning and is In the hands of the national bank examiner. The bank is one of the oldest there and the largest financial institution in the city. The bank has been In a weak ened condition since its last statement, August 22, when it was stated the in stitution owed the clearing house close to $1,000,000. "When the financial disturbance came and the clearing house decided lo issue clearing house certificates, ru mors regarding the ban It's condition came, and the clearing house, in the past few days, has held several confer, cnces of other national banking offi cials in this connection, and means of Keeping the bank open were discussed. Wednesday much surprise was ex pressed when the request of the comp troller for a statement of the condition ,of the banks was not responded to by Ifie National Bank of Commerce. The local, banks published their state :i1 tints, showing a healthy condition, liut the officials of the Commerce an nounced its statement would not be forthcoming till Thursday. This cre ated further distrust in the bank's con dition, and after conferences lasting into the early hours of Thursday morning the clearing house ofhcials de rided they could not aid the failing banlc.

PROS TO STAY. Harrlmao Sees Decided Rebound from ^, Depression. That the country is already begin hl^g to recover from- the severe shock received In the recent panic Is the opinion of B. H. Harrlman, as express, ed ,in an Interview published In New York Wednesday. "We are. in the rebound from the depression, and we are In It to stay," Mr. Harrlman said. "There will be no falling back-—each step we are taking 1» firm. Under the whole situation theire Is Industrial stability. There is too much work .to be done, and too Sreat capacity for doing it to allow a long drawn 9Ut depression. There are Indications everywhere that confidence is being restored. The country is too big and the people too sensible to allow the acts of a few men to shaks their faith in the integrity of our great financiers and business meii as a whole. Naturally there was a little scare at first, but when the people saw that there were rotten spots only here and there they quickly recovered from their fright. The dawn of a new era of prosperity is here. The strain on cash Is being relieved and credit is once more being allowed to perform its normal work. "But we must not expect at once to see any line of commercial business, as active as it has been during the past two years. Perhaps it is better for the country that it should not be so. have a presidential campaign in front of us. It is only natural that we should feel our way cautiously for some time. When I say cautiously, however, I do not mean hesitatingly, but rather conservatively." TO ATTACK BROWN WIIJTJ. Mrs. Bradley Will Bring Action to Break It. Now that she has been acquitted on the charge of murder, Mrs. Annie M. Bradley, through her attorneys and in behalf of her children, will bring an tion to break the will of the late Senator Arthur Brown, whom she shot to death in Washington. Her friends at Salt Lake City say that such a course has been contemplated ever since the will was opened. The con test will be based on the written ac knowledgment of Senator Brown that Mrs. Bradley's two sons are his own. In his will Brown expressly disavowed •the paternity of the two children and [stipulated they should receive nothing 'from nis estate. The greater part of the estate amounting in all to some i960,000, was devised to his son Max and his daughter Alice. The attack on the will, which has already been ad mitted to probate, will not commence until Judge Powers returns from Washington. BLOW AT HARVESTER TRUST. Claim of President to Control Nearly All Trade Admitted as Evidence. The state gained an important point Wednesday in it^sult to oust the Inter national Harvester company from Kansas. P. W.

Presdent McCormick had said fur ther that it was the purpose of the company to provide for a uniform sale price. The harvester company's attorneys tried to have this evidence stricken out, but this Judge Dana refused to do.

DELAY IS TRIPP COUNTY. Prospective Settlers Must Walt Nearly a Year. Intending settlers who are looking for an early opening of the government lands in Tripp county will have to wait longer than was first anticipated. Such Is the information driven out by Hon. J. H. Scriven, the government's allot ting agent, who has been at work on these, lands since last spring. As to the progress being made in the work of allotment Mr. Scriven made the following statement when asked as to the possibility of an early opening of the government lands,'it being under stood that the opening depended largely upon the time It would take to allot the lands. "We w&re forced to suspend our Held work last week. When the ground was burned over last fall It had frozen so deep that we could not drlvfe stakes or dig pit holes. We have al lotted, since beginning the field work June 1, 700 different applications, and will have about 900 more to make in the spring. This winter the force will be occupied- in enrolling what has been allotted, taking .family records and listing new applications for next year's work. I am satisfied we will" be able to get all of this kind of work done by the time the frost is out of the ground so we can begin field work again next spring. The department requires me to take the family record or census of each person that I allot, and as this is a new departure from the Old time methods, when all an In dian had to say was, "Allot my child," and the allotting agent did the rest. The Indians were very, very slow for the first two or three months in giving In their records. This made it very inconvenient and difficult work, as we frequently had to make drives much too far In order to reach our day's al lotlng. "With all details arranged I can sys tematize and bunch the allotments so that we can easily do twice as fast work as we have been able to accom plish this year, and if the frost is out of the ground sufficiently for us to be gin field work by April 1 we will be through by Aug. 1, and with all the lit tle details arranged it will not be nec essary for me to put In much of my time in the field, which will give me ample time to work on my books and records. FIRE LOSS IS $3,000. Three Frame Buildings Destroyed in Sioux Falls Blaze. An accounting of the damage done by a fire Saturday morning, when the entire northern portion of the busi ness district of Sioux Falls was for a time threatened with destruction, re veals that although only three frame buildings were burned, the loss wiil reach about $5,000. The loss is divided as follows: E. B. Smith & Co., $800 no insur ance. George Courtney, $900 no Insur ance. Emil Larson, destruction of ware house and farm machinery, $4,000 in surance, $1,00{ The destroyed barn of E. B. Smith & Co. was one of the very oldest structures in Sioux Falls. It was built In the fall of 1871, a short distance from the site which it occupied when destroyed. It was built by W. F. Kiter and housed the second newspa per plant ever located in Sioux Falls. It was In the old structure that the Weekly Pantagraph—a famous news paper of pioneer times—was first pub lished. Mr. Kiter and the members of his family also made their home in a part of the building. The old building ultimately was converted into a barn. PASSING OF THE MAIL BOAT. People of Fort Pierre Will Now Be Supplied by Train. Ever since the Northwestern rail way has begun to carry mall into Pierre from the east, the people of the town of Fort Pierre have been sup plied with a boat mail service, which was anything but regular at times when the river was either freezing in the fall or the ice breaking up in the spring. But beginning Monday of next week the local train between Pierre and Fort Pierre will begin carrying mail, and the old boat service is gone This will be appreciated by the people west of the river, who can be assured of regular mail what ever the condition of the river. THE MINK ESCAPED. Farmer Lost 500 Tons of Hay Trying to "Smoke Him Out." Five hundred tons of hay for a mink skin is the price Frank Dann, living twelve miles southeast of Clark, paid this week. He was trying to smoke the animal out from a hole in the pasture when the fire got away from him and destroyed a large amount of hay, several nearby farm buildings being narrowly saved (from destruction. Dann was badly burned while trying to keep the flames In iheck. The mink escaped. Veteran Commits Suicide.

Out of the various franchises one has just been granted to a com pany of Mitchell men, who expect to buy the property of the Mitchell Gas company or erect a new light plant. The new company has made a large reduction in rates, the minimum rata being 10 cents per thousand watts, which is made lower still by a larger use of electricity. The company ex pects to largely Improve the service In the city, and by spring it will Install a twenty-foui* hour service. Two gas franchises -were also introduced at the same meeting of the council, which were placed on their first reading. Both made a lower rate for gas than is now furnished in this city. The rate of one is $1.25 and the other $1.60 per hundred cubic feet If both are passed Mitchell will, have three gas companies. ... •TOO 

MUCH ECONOMY. State Unable to Meet Public Demand for Blue Book. In a fit of economy the legislature of last winter limited the issue of the state blue book to 720 copies, and made no provision whatever for the publication of any of the documents for sale, nor for distribution to the people of the state on request. The members evidently looked upon this as something which they were to have to themselves, and did not take the general public into consideration in making the provisions for the work. The office of the secretary of state is being flooded with applications fo,r the book, or information as to where cop ies can be purchased. The only provi sion whatever for distribution was to give the secretary of state enough cop ies to exchange with other states and to supply each state officer with one, the rest going to members and em ployes of the two, houses. The 720 will have to fill a demand which will be several thousand, as by the nature of the document itself there will be a greater call for it from the people of the state than for any other public document which might be issued. GAINS FOR DAKOTA BANKS. Heavy Increase in Deposits During the Past Year. Reports of the state bank examiner and of the national banks doing busi ness in South Dakota certainly make a good showing for the past year. The reports cover the condition of banks for the period between September, 1906, and August, 1907, practically a year, and show that in that time the state banks have Increased from 336 to 387, with a heavy increase In de posits. At the last named date the state banks showed deposits amount ing to $34,728,628.64, an increase of $6,586,347.62 over the September con dition the previous year. For the same time the national banks of the state had increased from 79 to 87, six new banks having been opened for business in the year. These banks carried $20,229,479.26, an in crease of about $3,000,000 for tha year, making the total net Increase in deposits in the state for the year $9, 399,131.32, and the total bank depos its of the people of the state at that time $54,950,107.90. GIRL HOMESTEADER SLAIN. Rejected Suitor Accused of Crime Near Pierre. A brutal murder was committed early Monday morning in a little prai rie house about twenty miles south of Fort Pierre, the victim being Miss Lily Kelly, a homesteader who came there from Mankato, Minn. A. F. Bowman, a young man of that city, has been held for a hearing. It appears that a small party of young people, among them her brother, gathered at the home of Miss Kelly Sunday evening and remained until after midnight. Monday morning the brother went -Slo the home of his sister and found her on the floor of the house with her skull crushed. Bowman, who had been a suitor for the young woman, who did not fancy him, had threatened her. He was absent all night from the place where he worked, returning ear ly Monday morning.

Tawnar of Minnesota, ihsjrman of the committee on appropriations, just re turned from Panama with seventeen members of the committee, predicts that the canal will be completed by Dec. 31, 1014. "We found everything going along In, the moat satisfactory way," the Congressman declares. "There may be a million cut off. the sum ot $32,000,000 asked for construct tion, although demands in the main have been modest Reductions will b« aslced in only a few departments. "So cial conditions there are better gener ally than among the -workmen of the United States. Workmen are well cared for and satisfied. We found the employes, clerical, medical and engin eering, were paid 60 per cent more than at home, while quarters are fur nished. A single man gets a room married men house. Canal men are paid one-third more than at home, and they can live more cheaply. The gov ernment sells them supplies at a lower rate than home prices. Ice water and light are cheaper than in New York. Sanitary conditions are all that can be desired." In all the money centers of tbe coun- '\v try, as well as In Wall street, the news of the government's bond and note Is sues caused a feeling of relief and the financial skies were clearing. Every where bankers were eager to get the new securities and there was no need of an underwriting syndicate. Many sent telegrams of congratulation to the President and Secretary Oortelyou. Subscriptions to both issues have al ready begun to pour In. Nevertheless Chicago's clearing house carried out its project of issuing certificates In denom inations of $1, $2, $5 and $10, and over $3,000,000 in these were eagerly grabbed for current business needs. At New York quantities of currency brought 2 and 3 per cent on the curb. But at tbe same time arrangements were in progress for a resumption of a cash basis all over the country. The indictment of three officials of the Bor ough Bank of Brooklyn for false re ports of the bank's condition was taken as another sign of the financial house cleaning In progress. Three railroad companies, the Atch is n, Topeka and Santa Fe, St Louis ^7 and San Francisco, and the Missouri Pacific, have absolutely declined to comply with an order of the Postofflce Department that for the next forty days these roads should carry empty mail bags and other mall equipment back to the distribution centers with out compensation therefor. The reason for this order was a desire to prevent a tie-up or congestion of mail during and just preceding the holidays. To this end, It was thought that it would be well to have the equipment trans ferred more speedily than can be done by freight, which is the method' pro vided. While there is some doubt as to the right of the department to en force its order, the law permits the us* !j of the express companies for the pur-® pose in question, which would meet the emergency, though proving rather ex- Msii pensive. lillsiiii The military authorities of the Tarl ous governments have not overlooked ,* ,, the important part which airships will I probably play in the wars of the fu- „. ture, and are making active prepara tions for both offensive and defensive operations along this line.
