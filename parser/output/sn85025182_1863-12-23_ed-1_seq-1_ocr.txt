Men may fiaht for fame and glory, ' Some may fight just "for the tin," Giro as then our noble leader, Let as fight bat fight to win, Uncle Sam has lots of mo.,ey.

Lincoln's great on Proclamations, Stanton councels Uncle Sam, Halleck does as their adviser Generals; some a perfect sham. THE DESPOT'S EDICT. There was a time when the annual Mes sage of a President of the United States was designed for the instruction, guidance and benefit of the white race for whom the Re public was created ; to-day we publish a President's Message that, while it insulting ly ignores these topics of .vital interest to the white citizen, is devoted almost exclu sively to suggestions and theories relative the negro. If anything could inspire the chief magistrate of an enlightened, people witli statesmanship and sense of duty, such inspiration, one might hope, would have resulted from the contemplation of the des olation and ruin that have been wrought wiibin the space that assion and preju dice have give lo the horrors of civil strife Millions of American citizens will this day peruse the President's Message with the hope of fiading therein something sugges tive of a termination of the hideous scenes of the past thirty months. How bitter will be the disappointment to discover nothing i..r--;M nA tmnrootir.MA ntan , for the consummation of abolition ! The Meanwhile, from day to day, we have Massage is rambling,-vague and evasive -canned the columns of the "War Demo opon every subject but this. Its greater j cralic" journals with cariosity and expect ation, brief as it ts, is devoted to details i disconnected with our domestic troubles. But the very first sentence that Mr. Lincoln dedicates to the subject of our sectional diSerences,' brings him in contact with the negro question, and from that point to the conclusion, Lhare is no fact, no argument, no theory advanced that has not in view the realization of the scheme of emancipation. The "policy of emancipation" "and of em ploying black soldiers" is first alluded to in connection with onr political situation, and having beau thoroughly exhausted, gives place to the labyrinthine outlines of a plan jo make abolition the imperative condition of reconstruction. -v No unprejudiced mind can dwell upon ttis part of the Message without the convic tion that Mr. Lincoln has determined to prosecute i.'lia war hereaftur exclusively in the interest of emancipation and according to the extreme purposes of the Radicals. If the intention" were openly avowed,. one Slight give the man at least the tribute due in boldness ; but there is a low cunning ex hibited ia parade of sophistry that jars upon t!i3 fcslingi as something which, when a ' 5c:a:sd w:ih ideas of oCcial digaity and icsor, bring shame and humiliation to the entire people. The plot, for ir is nothing hi33 than a treacherous and despicable plot, ii not developed ia the Jlescase proper. To give it it osce the fores of an executive ec'ict, h-3 appeaia a proclamation, purport i ia be one of amnesty, but in reality de- f .-. . . i ...... m i hirai'oa ia its secaaea tiates taa i I rrr.s asw' Ccuutloas fcostild to I slavery. "A number of persons not less than one-tenth in number of the rotes cast in such States at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord J8I0, each having taken the oath aforesaid, and excluding all others," may "re-establish a State Govern ment,'' which "shall be recognized as the true Government of the State?" "And it is engaged as not improper that ioconstract ing a loyal State Government in any State, the name of the State, the boundary, the mb-divisions, the Constitution, and the general code of taxes be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions herein before stated (those of. the Emancipation Proclamation), and such others which may be deemed expedi ent by the; new State Government." The suggestion is that it is not "improper" to retain tin old Constitution, bat the sugges. lion amounts to au invitation to do other wise. By observing the tenor of -'the oath aforesaid," it will be seen that no person can assist in the formation of these new State Governments who is not sworn to "abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed daring the existing rebell ion, with reference to slaves," and also "to abide by and faithfully support all procla mations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, Patting this and that together, the simplest logician will perceive that it becomes int. possible for any Stale to return to the Union except coder the oath of its citizens to con sent to the abolition of slavery. - Is not this an effectual bar to reconstruc tion ? j not this a prosecution of the war directly for for the consummation of Eman cipation 1 Having sacrificed so much of their best blood and .undergone so much financial, social and political misfortanes with the prospect before them of years oj ruinous warfare, the people of the North cannot be blind to the propriety of establish ing some standard of reconciliation that it is possible for the South "to accept. Yet now we have it distinctly proclaimed by the Administration that the only avenue to re construction leads under the yoke of Aboli tion. Who shall say that is not the pliant tool of fanaticism, that it is in accordance with our Republican institutions for one- tenth of the voters of a State to remodel, ar.d in fact to re-create the laws and Constitution-o( the State, especially when it is within tae power of the. Administration, in the event ol military occupation, to flood such a Slate with me emissaries of its will ? So far from being stlf-government, the re alization of such a scheme would be worse than tyranny ; it would be the betrayal of the principle fought for by our fathers, by a mean and treacherous trick, which would eternalize discord, suspicion and haired be tween the sections. A noticeable feature of the Message is the absence of all allusion to the arbitrary acts of the Administration, to the suspension of Habeas Corpus, to the Conscription Bill and its ridiculous failure, and to the many de parture?, from our system of government which Lave been the themes for universal comment. These things have touched the popular heart to the core ; the public jour nals have dilated upon them unceasingly, they have been and are a source of general concern and anxiety; but our Chief Magis. irate does not condescend, to give them s passing nottce ; secure tit the military power be commands, he disdains to explain to excuse or to justify ; his official attention is too much preoccupied with that now confessed purpose : Emancipation at all hazards. Mr Lincoln's present Message reveals the Radical policy in all its disloyal, disunion and anti-republican aspects, and consigns its author to eternal infamy. N. Y. Daily News. The 'War Democrats." Several days have now elapsed since the publication of Mr. Lincoln's Emancipation Jiessage ana -ADoiuion r rociamation. c lOMwnain wneuior may wouia at once renounce tueir advocacy oi a war now confessed to be for the single purpose of Abolition, or whether they would still seek to justify their absurd doctrine by some miserable subterfuge and canning sophistry. We have examined the editorials of The World of The Journal ot Commerce, of The Express, not conceiving it possible that those ardent organs of a "War for the Union" could continue to advocate a pro. longation of hostilities, after the President had distinctly proclaimed that no "War for the Union" was being waged. Bat those journals seem postively to ignore this fact, which completely confounds and de molishes their theory, and while they com ment severely upon the disunion tendencies of the Message, still uphold the murderous and runious strife which according to their own argument, is destructive of ail the ele ments of Reconstruction. Mr Lincoln, th.jy admit, has postively. proclaimed the war to be hostile to Reunion, yet . they in sist upon the prosecution of this Anti-Union War. The inference is, either that there is no sincerity in their protestations of regard for the Union, or that being completely be wildered by the intricacies of the false po. sition they have assumed, they have, deter mined to ignore all troth and consistency, and to toss without rudder or compass upon the currents of the political maelstrom. At a time like this,, when so much de pends upon journalistic honesty and firmness nothing can be more despicable than a rAnnlrstinn (tf rusnnntihi t It v nr t, a rart rt f - J - - t - a public joarcal. GsaUsasa cl its 'War Democratic' Press, define your position and let the people know what principle yon are contending for ; or if you dare not own ; a principle, confess your unworthiness to guiae ana instruct tne paonc, ana aostain hereafter from comment upon political themes. You acknowledge the war to b conducted in the interest of disunion, so far yoa are in the right. Bat yoa support the war such as it is, tempering only your sup port with occasional denunciations of the Administration. .The fact is still patent that you support a war which you insist has every disunion attribute. How can the conclusion be avoided either that at heart yoa are disonionists, or that some eelfmh motive controls your boasted affection for the Union and makes yoa "palter with us jn a double sense V The World says that that Mr. Lincoln "has rendered a Union party in the Sonth impossible." In the face of that impossibility, why sanction a war so frought with misery and mistortuno f Why should The World demand that hun dreds of thousands of lives, billions of treas ure commercial prosperity, financial order, social happiness, political security, should be sacrificed in a mad endeavor to accom plish an impossibility! Perhaps The World thinks that reunion can be effected without a Union party at the Sooth. Does it pretend that such a Union would be de sirable, or that it would be possible without the entire overthrow of oar political fabric ? Oar contemporary does not intimate that a Union majority wocld be impossible, but a "Uoioa party,'' which means that, in its estimation, the South is and will remain unanimous in resistance to reconstruction. Does The World expect to prevail upon the Administration to change its policy ? Does it hope that some miracoleus agency will intervene between Mr. Lincoln and his fanaticism t Will that insensate wor ship of Abolitionism, which has intensified from year to year, until now it is the para mount, nay the onlj object of Radical exist ence, be relinquished by its idolators, and the pore flame of patriotism supply its place ? There is not a "War Democratic" organ that conceives so vain a hope, or that would haTe the effrontery to make it the excuse for prolonging the appeals to arms. The North is being decimated, tmprovereh- ed, ruined by a strife for which no b.?ter result is claimed, even by Mr. Lincoln, than the extenction of Slavery. The "War Democratic" organs admit the fact, deplore it, but cry let ns fight (on I We are fight ing to achieve that which is impossible, yet let as fight on ! They describe the Jugger naut in all its hideous aspects ; they call attention lo in as it rolls on through blood p.nd carnage, leaving desolation behind, while every hope of Union vanishes betore its path; they nay, Lo '.the accursed engine of the Republic's destruction, the in stru ment of disbnion, and they call upon the people to put their shoulders to the wheels and push it on. If the "War Democratic" organs, by some subtle reasoning, have discovered how it can be just for them to advocate that which they condemn. or how it can be wise to attempt that which they confess irnpos sible, we trust they will give their logic to the people. We ask them two plain ques tioos : Do they believe that the Admin istration design to prosecute the war for the restoration of the Union ? Do they sap port the war ? - If the first question be an swered in the affirmative, tbey belie their own words. If in the negative, how in their conscience, can tbey answer the second, except likewise in the negative ? Speak, geutlemen, and to the purpoae, so that, although but few may agree with you all may understand yoa ; and let the people after their President's direct repudiation of a "War for the Union," be no longer mysti fied by the sophisms of journals that still cling to that abandoned theory. N. Y Daily News. 'from Greenland'! ley Sonntains."' The late Dr. Raffles, in a letter to Dr. Lowell Mason, gives the following interest ing account of the origin of the Missionary Hymn of Bishop Heber, "From Greenland's Mountains,'7 which is now sang tho wide world over : "Heber, fhen rector of Hodent, married the daughter of Dean Shiply, Rector or Vi car of Wrexham, in North Wales. On a certain Saturday, he came to the house of his father-in-law, who resided at the rec tory or vicarage, to remain' over' Sunday, and preach in that church for the Church Missionary Society. ' As they sat conversing after dinner, the Deaa said to Heber, "Mow, as yoa are a poet, suppose yoa write a hymn for the ser. vice to-morrow mornicg " Immediately be took a pen, ink and pa per, and wrote that hymn, which, had be written in nothing else, would have im mortalized him.- He read it to tho Dean, and said i "Will that do?" "Ah," he replied, "and we will hsve it printed and distributed in the pews, that the people may sing it after the sermon.'' -"Bat," said Heber. "to what tnna will il go ! " - - " ' - v "Oh?' he added, "it will go to Twas when the seas were roaring." And so he wrote in ' the corner, at the top of the page, Twaa when the was were roaring." ."' - ; " ; The hymn was printed accordingly. : Laws are like cobwebs, which catch small flies but 1st wps and hornsw break throuzV The Dead Wife. Yes the wife yon loved so f oundly, cher ished so tenderly is dead. She lies in the shady room she loved so wel! ; but she heeds not now where they palace her. Yoa go in and look on thecalm and sweet face marble like in its repose no smile beams there on on your approach. The warm blood mounts no longer to the soft cheek. Yon press your lips wildly to hers, that for the first time gave back no answering pressure. Yoa take the little pale hand in yours, but the slender fingers clasp around yours no longer. Yon breathe the name that has ever been the dearest to yoa in the wide world, bat she bears your voice no more ; she is dead ! Tbey. robe her in a snowy shroud and lay her In a narrow coffin. Oh ! can you live while she is 'prisoned there, yoa wildly ask. ( The minister of God sajs a few solemn words weeping friends gather round to uke a last farewell, and when turned away yoa stand by her but for the last time. Can it be you must part with her forever; that yoa look for the last time on that deer face, press the last kiss to her cold lips ; but no tears come to your relief, and friends draw yoa away bat yoa watch the undertaker as he folds the muslin over that face, and torus the coffin lid closely down. Yoa feel as if yoa would suffocate, He does not heed, but puts the screws in qnickelt, tightly and yoa follow to the grave fhat yawns to receive the form clasped so maoy times to your heart. Yoa see them lower her in, and hear the clods with a doll hollow sound upon her coffin. Oh ! methinks there is no sound on earth that brings such feelings to tba heart, as the sound ot earth as it falls, covering the forms of those we love. Yoa seek your darkened home, but no white arms are clasped round yoar neck ; no sweet voice bids yoa welcome; no blue eyes look into yours speaking the love the lips do not always utter. Here is where she used to sit close by your side ; here the books she read : there her piano stands open with your favorite song spread ont ; bulrhe will sit by your side, read for yoa, play for yoa, no more forever. Yoa stand by the window look oat into the garden ; the flowers she planted are blossoming as brightly as if her band had trained them up this very morning, bat off beyond the garden yoa see the quaint church spire, and there close by, she slumbers. Yoa turn away and sit down with all this agony at your heart, and memory takes yoa back to the long ago, to the first bour of your acquaintance with ber, and yoa teel you loved her then and love ber now better than yoa can love one on earth. And you are right ; will ever be uearest and dearest. You any she re- member talking with her long ago, of death and of her saying she would wish to go first for she could never part with yoa on earth; and she bai gone first ; but can too live without hcb ? You read the letters' she penned to you in yoar absence yoa look on a tress of sunny hair severed after death, with a grief at your heart whicn will not be hushed. Years pass on, and another may bright en your home, but as yoa listen to her merry words and joyeous laugh, when the dark eyes look in yoar own, when ber hand is warmly closed in yours, the memory of the loved and lost will sweep. over your own heart until yoa forget the loving one by yoar side. Sometimes yoa see a face or form that resembles hers, or hear a voice low and soft as hers used to ' be and you find the young heart mouldering in the grave is as dear to yoa as ever; though an other fills ber place by yoar side, and yoa thought for a time you had given ber op. Bat no she comes often to yoa as yon sit by your cheerful fireside ; yon feel the arms circling round your neek, the soft lips pressed to your brow ; see the eyes so mild and - loving, looking down through yours into your soul ; yoa hear the low tones telling yoa again bow dear yon are, bat yoa start op nervously and look around on those gathered about yoa, trying to shake off the illusion as yoa remember how long she has been sleeping. Ah, the first true love of the heart never will, never can die out. It may be silent for a time, bat it will rise op like ghost to baant the hoars that might otherwise be happy. The heart, thank God, is locked away from all human eyes. Rep n.b lit an Dictionary,
