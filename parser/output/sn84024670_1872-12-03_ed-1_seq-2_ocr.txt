TUESDAY EVE'G, DF.CEMBER 3,1572. ■ 11l- MESSAGE. We lay before our readers to day the full text of the President's Message, which ought to have been transmitted by the Associated Press in time for our afternoon edition yesterday. The message was in their hands, ready for transmission, at a low minutes past one o'clock, and three hours' limo whs amply sufficient, with the number of wires at their command, in which t. have forwarded it for the evening [Man of the South. But no part of it came except as a "special," and we obtained iho best we could of that. The message is a clear, comprehensive, and'straightforward document. The con dition of tho Government in its several de- I partmeut- is succinctly, yet fully stated, while our relations with foreign govern ments are touched upon at sufficient length, and with sufficient accuracy of ..tatement, to enable any person of ordinary intelligence to thoroughly understand what has been done in the way of diplomacy during the pft3t year, and what i. likely to be our foreign policy for the ensuing year. The President congratulate- the country ! upon lhe happy settlement by arbitration of our recent unpleasant and very grave differences with the government of Great Britain, which had been submitted to the OWN Conference by the Treaty of Wash ington, and recommends, in this connection, the appointment of a Board of Commision c-m to make examination of tho several -laim. for indemnity, so that iudividual losses may be satisfactorily adjusted by tho time the Geneva award is due and pay able to the government. He refers, also, in gratulatory terms, to the settlement of tho vexed question of boundary between the two governments, which had been re ferred to the arbitration and award ot the Emperor of Germany, to decide upon t*ie construction and true interpretation of t.ie treaty of _B_G. In thi- award tho 'laim of the American government had been fully recognized by hi« Majesty the Emperor, and Great Britain had graciously acquiesced in giving effect to the decision. By this determination of tho Emperor of Germany, we secure the important archipe lago of islands, lying between tho continent tind Vancouver's Island, which Great Brit ain has persistently claimed and occupied ever since the ratification of tho treaty of 1340. It also leaves us, for the first time in the history of the country, without a disputed boundary question upon our hands. Our relations with the other powers of Europe, are referred to in grateful and graceful terras as being of the most cordial and friendly character, satisfactory treaties having been concluded during the past year with several of tbem in reference to natu ralization and other questions of material interest to our people. References are made io tho part our government has taken in the International Statistical Congress which L-tetjr assembled at St. Petersburg!), and: the pi'tpa rat ions making for the Interna lionftl Exp-sitii.n to be held during the I nc-t year i>i Vienna, at which adequate ; arrangenents will be made for the __-om-; modali'Hi of AlMTkell exhibitors. These I international projects are highly commended ! for tl.r-if t-ti-tenej- in tha direction of ad-1 ■ancedi-lviii*." i.i-ii, tbe elevation of indu.* try ami lab,., the met ease of human hap- ; pintaa, and the graatai mtercnirrM and j good-will between nation.. The President expresses bw regret that I lb-.e bi_. b.cti ii. advance since his Ins-1 ! .i..!iil_! message in (be parilication of the j liisootiU'iited portion of the people of Cuba. Ho refer.', to the insurrection an havirg ;:.ine<! no advantages iv the last year, vvbi'.i- il,:; .Spanish t'oveiiiiueiit has failed to j repress ihe rcsoltitionary demonstrations l of her people. The contest has now lasted For four year., and the President regards ihe continued maintenance of slavery in that ilk-id as the chief obstacle in the way of a restoration oi peace. He expresses the hope that the present liberal government of Spain v.ill voluntarily adopt the views which have been uniformly urged upon itn consideration by the American government. Our rela tions with the Central and South Ameri can government- continue to bo of tho -tout friendly character, a. well as (hose with Japan and China. Onr relations with the Mexican Ilepub- j lie aro referred to in connection with tho ' death of the late President and the election of hid tt tnporary successor, and while the many lawless act. that have distutbed the quiet of the border settlements, in conse ■ ;»-ne. of the late revolutionary condition •'f that republic, arc reftired to as subjects of just complaint on tlio part, of our government, it is believed that the cause, of grievance will cease uader the more satisfactory condi tion of atlairs iv that government. The ! commissioner, appointed to inquire into tho depredations committed on the Texan fron tier have not yet fully completed their la bor., and an additional appropriation is (•commended to enable them to perform their duties agreeably l# the resolution un der which they wero appointed in May laat. The financial exhibit of the government ia in the highest degree satisfactory. The condition of the War and Naval depart* mmta are referred to at length, with Bug ge.tiona ar.d recommendations which we shall more particularly consider hereafter. Tho condition of the Indian tribes, the affairs of tho territories, our public land., their sale for educational purposes, the question of pensions, tho centennial cele bration, the decennial census, education, agriculture, patents, and the civil service, : all corao in for their share of appropriate j ] consideration in the message. Tho depart- j ; ment of the Postofflce makes a most favor able showing for the past fiscal year. And the President warmly endorses the proposi tion of tho Postmaster-General to acquire the title of all the telegraph lines in the United States and connoct them with tlio postal sorvice of the government. But the most important suggestion con tained iv the message, so far as our own State is concerned, is that in regard to the Water Lines of the Republic. Tho Presi dent happily recognizes these lines as of tho highest important-) to the agricultural and commercial interests of tho country, and urge., their consideration, at the earliest practical moment, upon tho legislative branch of the government. Tho extension of tho James River and Kanawha Canal to the Ohio, is among theso recommendations, and it behooves our people, and especially the General Assembly of tho Stato, to take such action in this matter as will most poworfully commend this great work to the consideration of the national Congress. It can be shown to be the most important nnd desirable of all the water-lines named, and, with ener getic pushing on our part, it can be the first coiiiplett.il. What is now required at the hands of Virginia statesmanship is i a heartier co-operation than ever with the I Federal Government in all that concerns j the material prosperity and growth of our | State. Send all past political feuds and prejudices, with old fogyism, to the wall, and a brighter and more glorious era than Virgina has yet seen, may speedily dawn upon our future. The President, according to all reports from Washington, stands firm and openly declares his purpose to enforce reform in tho Civil Service by the promotion in every instance of the subordinate who is the most ! competent to fill tha duties. While he does not propose to open the doors of competi tion to the friends and opponents of the Administration alike, he proposes to insist that competency shall be the rule, even if it exclude Republican aspirants, and that the efficiency of the service shall be pro moted by filling all vacancies from the ranks of subordinates. The money-order business of tho Post- Office Department has rapidly grown to great magnitude. During the year ending June 30, 1872, it exceeded $93,000,000. Of this vast sum, sent in small remittances, none exceeding ijMO, and the average not exceeding $20, little or none was lost. It is possible that the science might be extended, so as to enable persons to send 8100, with great convenience and safety to the public.
