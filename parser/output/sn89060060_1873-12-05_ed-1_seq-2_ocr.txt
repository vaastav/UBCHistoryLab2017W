|)ort(£a&fcro £imcg PORT TOBACCO: Friday Morning, December 5,1873. Consreso. Congress met promptly on Monday last. : The Senate was called to order by Vice President Wilson, who seems to have re covered from his attack,of paralysis suffi ciently to preside. After the call of the roll, Ac., Mr. Sumner introduced a batch of bills, and among them bis usual supple mentary cjjril rights bill—providing for the equality of the negro in hotels, steam boats, schools, churches, graveyards and everywhere else. The House organized by the re-election of Mr. Blaine to the Speakership. This is Mr. B. r g third term of service, and is a de served compliment, by his party, to his talents. He is, perhaps, take him all in all, in the Republican ranks. He is, comparatively speaking, a yonng man, being now in the prime of life. He is a fine orator, full of brains and boldness. He is the only man on the Republican side of the House who is the master of Ben Butler. Ben, who Tauntingly said once that though he was called thief, &c., yet nobody evsr called him a fool, recognizes Mr. Blaine's talents, and recollecting a cas tigation received at his hands has now un bounded admiration for him. The message of the President was not received by either house until Tuesday, when it was read, and after the transac tion of some missellaneous business of not much importance the two houses adjourn ed until next day. On Wednesday the Senate was mainly occupied by a discussion of the financial question, during which Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, ventilated his views at length without evolving anything of importance, though rather sarcastic on the views of the Secretary of the Treasury t The House was mainly occupied with contested election cases, and the right of holders of certificates to their seats until the contest was finally determined. The session promises to be a long and stormy one, but will hardly settle down to its real work until after the Christmas holi days are over. • We propose to keep our readers advised of anything calculated to interest them specially. The Message. We lay before our readers a very full analysis of the President's Message, taken from the Baltimore Sun. The document is too lengthy for ns to publish. We have read it over somewhat hastily and there fore are not prepared to comment on it at this time. On some future occasion we mot equal to the occasion and therefore a ■ad failure. The Virginias Affair Settled. Our little flurry with Spain has been amicably settled as was anticipated. The Virginius is to be delivered at once, with her survivors, to the United States, and if Spain does not before Christmas day prove to the U. S. that the vessel improperly used our flag, then Spain i? on that day formally to salute the flag, and is further to institute proceedings against any‘par ties who may have violated international •r treaty rights. Thus the matter is set tled and we are glad of it. For tho’ on proper occasions we will be as earnest as any body else in vindicating the national honor, yet we would much prefer that the occasion should never occur to require it to be done by force of arms. War .is a fearful thing, and we hope never to see it again. It may be it is necessary some times, but it is a cruel necessity, and bears with the greatest hardship on the poor and humble; and for ourselves we- would like to see “those who make the quarrels be the only ones to fight,” as the old song has it. We hope that our authorities will profit by the experience now acquired and dievote more attention to the enforcement of the neutrality laws, and keep a sufficient force on the Cuban station to- prevent a similar outrage. Political Dereliction. Governor Seymour, in a recent letter to .the Manhattan Club, said: “While we shall deplore political dereliction in any quarter, we shall reserve our sharpest criticisms and sternest denanctaAioas for un faithfulness #b the part of those whose elections we supported, and not for those whose eleva tion we resisted. In view of the tn-ftuences which pervade the party in power we shall hold unfaithfulness in office a greater crime in a Democrat than in a .Repubifoar*, and we shall deem it our first duty to punish wrong-doers in our own camp.” . Governor 8. is this day one of the ablest of the statesmen of the Democratic party. He is a man of great breadth of mind and of singular purity of character, and there fore wo prize suoh sentiments the more highly because of tho Source whence they come. They are the words of an honorable man and not of a demagogue—and they embody, in appropriate words, sentiments which we have long entertained. As he properly say s, when we consider the origin of the Republican party—bom amidst the throes of a popular convulsion; installed in povrar dur|pg a civil war, the like of which the world has never seen, when the only law preached was that “the safety of the Republic was the supreme law,” and re taining power since the termination of the was, by keeping alive the angry passions caused, by it: Looking thus to all these things, we have no right to expect from our Opponents the same high tone and in tegrity of purpose s* we .do in a Democrat who has grown up in the shadow of the 1 ....... • .t • THE 

PORT TOBACCO TIMES AND CHARLES COUNTY ADVERTISER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1878. Constitution and been taught by Jefferson and the fathers of our country that the safety of our republican form of govern ment depended bn a strict construction of the Federal powers,- the preservation of States' rights, and a firm adherence to the honesty and frugality of the early days of tbji Republic. -Hence, when we see a man wearing-the livery of the Democratic par ty and going astray we feel it our duty to censure him in no measured terms. And therefore it is that we hail with infinite satisfaction the justice which has recently been meted out to “Boss Tweed,” for he was not one of “the invincibly ignorant.” And hence we also condemn emphatically the action of the Democratic Congression al caucus in failing to condemn the in creased pay bill. • HjT’The President has offered Attorney- General Williams the position of Chief- Justice, which was very promptly accept ,ed. ‘ “dead” Democratic party has now Democratic Governors in fifteen States as follows: Connecticut, Delaware, Geor gia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mis souri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, and the Legislatures in fifteen States. For a “dead” party this is a remarkable showing.. g3f°The New York World says: it is as clear as sunlight that the Democratic par ty, we mean the voters of the Democratic party from Maine to California, demand of their Representatives in Congress that they shall brand the salary-grab iniquity as it deserves, by calling for its repeal at once, by forcing the issue upon Congress, and by voting for its repeal, every man of them. That is the sincere desire of most honest people; it is the imperative demand of the honest masses of the Democratic party, ut tered with clear and unequivocal accents in every State Democratic Convention which has met-since Congress adjourned. Demand the repeal of the salary-grab. Tweed and tala Accomplices. A few days ago the trial of T weed end ed in New York, and Judge Davis sen tenced the convicted prisoner to twelve years’ imprisonment. That trial was im mediately followed by those of Farrington and Ingersoll, his accomplices. These men, like their chief, were found guilty and sent .to the Penitentiary, one for five years, the other for eighteen months. In passing sentence upon Ingersoll Judge Da vis said: “You took a solemn oath to sup port the-Constitution of your country, and to faithfully discharge the office of Court house Commissioner. How did you keep that oath? You, yourself, became aplnn vieiet, out; oViHwyb engagfed fn a scheme of plunder, the greatest, perhaps, known in any country. You appear on the Tweed trial to be the recipient of claims for over three millions of dollars, of which you kept one million seven hundred and thir ty dollars, and turned over the rest to Woodward.” In sentencing Farrington, Judge Davis said he was glad that Inger soll had the manliness to admit now what he might have admitted on the trial, that his (Farrington’s) case was different from the other, in that he djd not forge names, but it was proved that he had made out a false account, adding thereto 50 per cent. -This-made him a participant in the crime, if not in its proceeds, and hence his sen tence and imprisonment. Mr. Crswell’s newspaper Postage Scheme. Mr. C res well having induced Congress to pass a law abolishing newspaper exchang es on the free plan, now, as one of our ex changes justly remarks, “thinks it would be an excellent movement to abolish the present system by which newspapers are circulated through the mails to subscribers. Under the arrangements now in force a subscriber can pay his postagequarterly to the postmaster near his residence, and re ceive his paper at reduced rates of postage. Mr. Crcswell is not satisfied with this, which is an accommodation to the sub scribers to newspapers as well as to pub lishers. i He wishes a law passed which will compel every newspaper or magazine sent through the Postoffice to be paid for , in advance. Under such a system he thinks that the rates could be reduced on such matter, because the Department will be ; clear of loss. Looking at the matter from ‘; his point of view, which is merely how he i can obtain the greates amount of revenue - for the government, the Postmaster Gener i al is probably right, if he goes no deeper than a superficial consideration of the ques tion. But he would discover he was en tirely wrong if he went a little below the surface in his investigations. The value of a newspaper to the subscriber is that he ; shall receive it promptly as soon as possi ble after it is fssaed. “If every newspaper sent through the mails must be stamped before it can be transported, much delay will take place in affixing or printing stamps which the gov ernment require. The result would be ; great labor imposed upon the postoffice, and such delay in carrying the papers thro’ the mail as would disgust subscribers, and reduce circulation of all classes of journals. 1 The ppstoffiee would make nothing out of such a reform as this, and the only means , to avoid delay would be in having the stsmp printed beforehand upon the comer . of the sheets of printing- paper to be used for newspaperdmpressions, as was former ■ ly the case with English newspapers, the [ stamp being for revenue purposes. To ac complish this in England, where the circu lations are limited in comparison to what 1 they are m this country., might have been 1 easy. If such a method were adopted here ; the printing paper would have to be stamp ed by government officers before the pro prietors of journals* used it. This would necessiate delay, and sometimes prevent : the printing of such papers as were ! to go through the mail The waste by i spoiled copies and other accidents would 1 5 fall upon the publishers of papers, and the i result would be an annoyance with no ad- 1 ’ vantage to subscribers and none to the - ’ United States Government. Mr. Creswell ] f has not considered but one side of the < 5 question.” . i f ' *** 4 1 From the Baltimore San. i 1 The Presidents Message- * The President’s message, which was de- 1 • livered to the two houses of Congress Tues- ' I day, shortlyafter one o’clock, and was pub- , , listed in a Sun Extra within two hours af ’ terwards, while it touches upon a great ' number of important subjects, hardly dis ! cusses any of them in away to challenge ( ’ special criticism or comment. In the very \ • first sentence of the message the President speaks of the past year, “especially the lat ter part of it,” as “an eventful one to the country,” and then proceeds to summarize the events that have happened, somewhat ■ oddly including among them, and in the . same breath with the Virginius affair, the fact that “political partisanship has almost 1 ceased to exist, especially in the agricultu ral regions.” The statement is somewhat ; obscure, and whether intended to refer to the rise of the granges at the West, or the ' > decline of the Ku-Kluk at the South, does ' i not clearly appear. In any case the fact J . chronicled can hardly be classed among , events. Following the usual order of subjects ob- ' ' served in such documents, the message be , gins as far from home as possible, with our J t foreign relations, and with one of the re motest of these—the Emperor of China.— 5 Gradually approaching matters of more j consequence, the President refers to the : payment by Great Britain of the Geneva ■ 3 award, and urges the appointment of a , ... commission to make distribution of the a- j mount among the parties entitled to it.— 5 Common honesty tfould suggest as much, f and it is to be hoped that the President’s | r recommendation will be acted upon. There * t can be no justification for the appropria- * tion or retention of this money by the Uni- J ’ ted States. A very sensible and timely re- , r commendation is made in reference to the . subject of expatriation. It is shown how j t excedi ngly defective our present legisla s tion is, and how anomalous the position 5 of this country before the world in this re ‘ spect. The nation which was the first to j J resist the slavish doctrine of perpetual al i legiance is now among the last to indicate how its own citizens may elect a foreign J nationality. Upon the subject of the Virginius noth- j ing new is communicated in the message. The terms of settlement are stated in the J - most favorable manner possible to the Uni ted States, with a curious omission to men- 1 tion those provisions and qualifications 1 3 which the public have been given to un- ' ‘ derstand form part of the settlement and J i which were evidently inserted as safe ; guards of Spanish honor and to soothe Spanish pride. The President excuses * 1 himself from going into greater detail, up -3 on the ground that the correspondence be- ' i tween the two governments was conducted i . in cypher and by telegraph, and he awaits 1 the receipt of the actual text by mail. Passing from matters foreign to domes- ' 1 tic, the President reepmends further a ■ mendments to the constitution authoriz > ing the executive to veto bills in part and j to approve m part; prohibiting any legis- ' r Wrtvr.A-1 * > " . 1 four hours of its sitting, and restricting! 1 that body when convened in extra session ( I to such business as the executive may r lay before it. It is questionable whether ; any of these measures are sufficiently im- : 1 portant to require an amendment of the ■ constitution. > In introducing the subject of the national 1 finances, the President alludes to the pres- 1 ’ ent difficulty of making both ends meet, and the necessity of greater economy in the 1 matter of the government expenditures.— ' t One saving recommended being the bus- ’ i pension, for the present, of work upon gov ernment buildings not yet commenced, the ’ hope is incidentally expressed that one 1 day we may feel rich enough to build • houses at Washington for the cabinet offi , cers and all persons who now receive com mutation for quarters or rent at govern ment expense and that the States may be tempted to do the handsome thing by building similar residences for their Sen • ators. • Later on in the message the city of Wash } ington, its improved streets and avenues, - and its board of public works, come in for . a “first rate notice” at the hands of the j President. The idea, which has ceased to be a novel one, is presented that the em -3 bellishment of the capital should be an ob e ject of pride and interest to the whole i. country, and that the improvements in a question should be regarded as “a nation al investment.” Upon the subject of the finances.gener ally, and the cognate topics of the curren cy and the “panic,” the message will hard 1, ly satisfy the expectations of those who . have been more or less eagerly awaiting _ its utterances. There is a want of clear [j ness in the language of the message which e is painfully suggestive of want of clearness r in the ideas of the writer. First and fore s most we have the declaration “that we can -1 not have permanent prosperity until a spe e cie basis is reached, and that a basis can a not be reached and maintained until our e exports, exclusive of gold, pay for our im e ports, interest due abroad, and other specie . obligations, or so nearly so as to leave an r appreciable accumulation of the precious metals in the cohntry from the product of . our mines.” e Next we are shown how, from increase e of population, increase of manufacturing e industries, and the habit of the southern - negroes to carry their wages .in their breeches’ pockets instead of depositing e them in the savings banks, the currency is e practically in a state of gradual contrac i tion. ft is further regarded as “patent to - the most casual observer that much more e currency or money is required during the i, fall and winter months” than during the i’ rest of the year; it is more than intimated 1 that with a ribn-elastic currency panics i. may thus come to be an autumnal institu f tion, like the equinox, connected with s “moving the crops.” To meet the emer e gency it is suggested that power be given r to the Secretary of the Treasury during i these periods of annual stringency to issue - to national banks a certain amount of e their own notes upon a deposit by them of - an equal amount of government bonds, the - bonds to. be redeemable by the banks at t their pleasure by returning an equal a rj mount of their bills for cancellation. e In this way it is supposed the difficulty -of a non-elastic currency can be overcome, - and elasticity be imparted to the present i paper issues of the country. The estab t lishment of clearing houses, the prohibi- - e tioft of payment of interest on deposits, j and a law requiring the banks to hold their reserves in their own vaults, are fur ther suggested as useful modifications of the present national banking Jaw, with a view to “a prevention of the use of other people’s money in stock and other species of speculation,’’ From all this, however, it is difficult to deduce any policy, or the suggestion of a policy, which leads up to resumption, or even looks steadily in that direction. Inflation is certainly not the road to specie payments, and the Presi dent’s scheme, for imparting elasticity to the currency is practical and periodical inflation—and nothing less. It is idle to expect that any rotation of the seasons can bring with it those periods of alternate contraction and inflation which are to cause now bonds, and now currency, to flow from the treasury, like the ebb and flow of a tide, Next to of the message which treats afJrtancial'matters directly, perhaps the nww important is that which relates to the bankrupt law, of which the President recommends, if not the absolute repeal, at leasfTthe repeal of so much as provides for involuntary bankruptcy on account of thfijpispension of payment.— There can be no doubt that the whole law, and especially this feature, is susceptible of very great improvement and needs care ful revision. Of the topics that formerly occupied the largest space in General Grant’s annual messages we find in the present one a no table dearth. St. Domingo is only allud ed to in a single sentence, where we are told that that republic (?) has applied for the exercise ofoan American protectorate over it. About the Ku Klux, Louisana, and southern lawlessness generally, there is not one word: A sentence is devoted to a renewal of former recommendations in favor of general amnesty. The Mor mons also escapehotice this time, although additional legislation is asked for to en : able the United States Courts iu Utah to obtain juries, ana a restriction of the juris diction exercised by the.territorial probate courts is also urged. The recommenda tion in favo* ofm.immense system of civil improvements, to be undertaken at the ex pense of the general government, is not renewed. By a curious infelicity of expression the President is made to say that cheap trans portation “has contributed to, if it has not been the direct cause of, the present panic and stringency.” We suppose the Presi dent to mean tba* excessive speculation in new railroads, promoted by unwise legis lation on the part of Congress, has contri buted to that disastrous result —but he. does not say it. He recommends Congress to undertake the care of the Erie Canal and of the Illinois State Canal, upon the condition that those canals should be open ed lor general traffic, but otherwise defers any further expression of his views until the special Senate committee on transpor tation shall hav4nade its report and re commendations. * One other exception the President makes to his general policy of opposition to further land grants by the general government. It is in favor of an irrigating canal to be constructed across the arid plain wrnich stretches from the eastern slope of r the Rocky mountains to the Missouri riv4*. No change in the Indian policy of the government is hjjted at. A quinquennial census is Civil service re tbrtv be days, in some uncertain future, when the “rule” shall have been definitely settled, and for that purpose a conference between a committee of Congress and the civil ser vice board is deeined advisable. A more effectual method of “quelching” the whole subject could not'be devised. Finally, in a single sentence, and that the last of the message, the passage of a law to better se cure the civil rights of the “newly enfran chised” is recommended, which Mr. Sum ner will probaWpthink a very insufficient notice of the subject, but then Gen. Grant, unlike Mr. Sumner, is not a man of one idea. v 

LOCAL MATTERS. Election of Officers. At a regular communication of St. Co lumbia Lodge, No. 150, A. F. & A. M., held at their haliJn this place on Tuesday evening last, the-following officers were e lected for the ensuing year; Worshipful Master —Henry G. Robertson. Senior Warden if—James L. Brawner. Junior Warden —J. Hurburt Roberts. Secretary —John S. Button. Treasurer —John G. Chapman. Tiler —William Wolfe. This Lodge if in a most healthy and flourishing condition. The .officer elect will be installed in office, according to the Masonic ritual, on St. John the Evangelist day, (Dec. 27th.) Adams’ Express Agency. We understand that the Adams’ Express Company propose to open an office in this place, and have tendered the agency there of to Wm. Boswell, Esq. They could not have selected a more reliable and energetic business manager. This Company, we un derstand, run- a special agent on the mixed train every day. This will be of immense convenience to our people who desire to forward or receive small packages with expedition and safety. The Zacbia Swamp Road, etc. The County Commissioners met at their rooms on Tuesday last, and after some routine business rescinded the resolution of their predecessors, inviting proposals for building a new road across Zachia Swamp, through the lands of Col. Samuel Cox, Mr. Nevitt, Wills, Carlin and others, and directed the advertisement to that ef fect to be discontinued. This road has given rise to .a great deal of controversy in the country adjacent to its route. Peti tions very numerously signed were pre sented in its favor, and it was claimed that it would benefit a considerable sec tion of the county now cut off from access to either the Railroad or to Chapel Point. On the other hand counter petitions as nu merously signed set forth that the road was not needed and would benefit a few per sons only who lived immediately on its line; that the expense, &c., would be very great. The old Board appointed a special commission of three to report on the sub ject. Two of these gentlemen (the other not having attended the meeting) reported in favor of the road, which woul<J be about two miles long, and estimated the cost at |3,000. The County Commissioners then issued a new commission to these same gentlemen to proceed to lay off the road, which they accordingly did—all three of the gentlemen being present. Mr. O. N. Bryan, who had not attended before, how ever, making a special report in which he estimated the cost at $6,000. In this con dition bids were invited, when the present Board stepped in and-put their veto, for the present at least, on the whole matter. We think they acted with commendable prudence in not entering upon so costly a work without taking time to investigate the matter themselves. We did not learn whether the Board made any disposition of the county mules for the winter, but we understood that the propriety of selling all the mules and pur chasing oxen to use on the public roads was discussed, but not determined. Thus we progress. Southern Maryland Railroad. The St. Mary’s Beacon of last week says; “From parties who have visited the Railroad line of the Southern Maryland Company within the past few days, we learn that the work of grading is indus triously progressing, a heavy force of la borers being still engaged thereon and working away with a will. We trust that no obstructions or delays —now that the , road is certain to be built—will be allow ad to impede its onward march a single moment, and that all parties on the line whose lands will be penetrated by the,road will anticipate its demands for a passage through them by a speedy and voluntary offering ®f the necessary “rights of way.” Heslin Remanded to the Penitentiary. The Supreme Bench of Maryland hav ing determined the right of the Governor to grant conditional pardons to prisoners in the •penitentiary, and that the failure of the person pardoned to comply with the conditions subjected him to resentence and reimprisonment, it devolved on Judge Gil mor to sentence Charles M. Heslin, alias John McNulty, who was pardoned out on condition that he would leave the State, but failed to do so. It will be remember ed that he was suspected of complicity in the Lampley murder and was arrested, when subsequently the warden of the Peni tentiary took measures to have him re manded. The case was tried in the Crim inal Court of Baltimore, Heslin being de fended by Messrs. Stanley, Clarke and Bowie, and resulted in finding that the defendant was liable to be remanded to prison. An appeal to the Supreme Bench having finally sustained this decision, one day last week Judge Gilmor passed sen tence on the prisoner, remanding him to the Penitentiary for the term of one year from November 25,1873. Indictments by the Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, at its recent session, brought down some indictmfS#W~fir<sre than ordinary interest to the public. One was against Mr. George W. Carpenter, the Register in the 3d election district, foY im properly refusing to register parties alleg ed to be entitled. One was against Mr. James A. Mudd, Register of Bryan town district, for neglecting to deliver the books of registration to the Sheriff. It is right the Grand Jury should investigate these matters, and guard with jealousy the elec tive franchise. The- Grand Jury also brought down two presentments against Mr. Zachariab Swann, one of the newly elected Board of County Commissioners — one for forgery and the other for perjury. It is to be hoped that Mr. Swann will speed ily vindicate himself, as it is not exactly the thing for a man occupying his respon sible position to have such charges hang ing over him. City Markets. Now that the Railroad is running regu larly our people living within easy reach of it should remember that, through its means they have almost at their doors two of the best markets in the world for eat ables of all sorts —meats, butter, garden truck, &c. We need not remind our read ers that, with our soil and climate, it needs but an effort on their part, by the sale of such things, to make a vast deal more mo ney than they ever can expect to realize from wheat, corn or tobacco. That we speak by the book we give below some quotations from the Baltimore papers? showing the prices for the various articles most in demand, and which we can fur nish as abundantly and cheaply as any other portion of the country, if we would give more attention to such things, viz:— Beefsteak, 16 to 25 cts. per pound; roast pieces, 15 to 16 cts.; veal, 18 to 20 cts.; mutton roast, 15 to 18 cts.; chops, 18 to 20 cts.; hog jowl, 6 cts.; hogs-head cheese, 12 cts.; pig hind quarter, 87$ cts.; fore quar ter, 62i cts.; pork, 10 to 12 cts. per pound; partridges, |2.25 per dozen; turkey, $1.50 to $3.00, as to size, or 20 to 22 cts. per pound: geese, 

SI.OO to $2.00; ducks, SI.OO to 1.35 per pair; chickens, SI.OO to $1.20; rabbits, 30 cts.; squirrels, 20 ots.; butter, 35 to 45 cts. per pound; eggs, 30 cts. per dozen, &c. These are about the average retail prices in the city markets. Signs of a Mild Wlntr. Some of the Northern papers, speaking of the probability of having a mild win ter, mention, among other reasons for be lieving so, the fact that the beavers have built very small and inferior houses, and without the usual double doors. In cor roboration of this we have noticed our selves, during the past wfp.k, a quantity of wild geese flying North, as if their instinct told them they could safely return there. This, if true, will be gratifying not only to our farmers but to all others, in view of the large number of working people out of employment in the large cities. t Heavy Frost. Saturday last might, with propriety, be called White Saturday, from the very heavy frost in the morning. It was the heaviest we .have ever seen, and we made it our business to hunt up that respecta ble person, “the oldest inhabitant,” and interview him on the subject, and he told us there had been one greater than that when he was a little boy, but ha did not recollect in what year, but so long ago that the Potomac was only a little stream then, and had not grown to one-tenth of its pres ent size, and we believe him. [Communicated.] Vacancy In Board of Commissioners.' Capt. Wells:— ln your last issue there was a communication complementary of Dr. Smoot, and urging him in strong terms to accept the place made vacant in our new Board of County Commissioners by the death of Mr. Ware. Now, whilst I heartily agree with “Occasional,” as re gards the Doctor’s eminent fitness, and as a man perfectly reliable in any position, I cannot endorse the principle, because it is directly opposed to rotation in office. The disregard of this principle in Democracy, even here in the county, had its evil effects upon the party in the recent campaign. It was used against us, and perhaps with justice, by the opposing candidates; and, worse than all, good Democrats did not vote the whole ticket and for that very reason. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to profit by the past and to keep our records clean and pure, so that its mem bers may feel a pride in its consistency, and our opponents have nothing to say that will cause us to blush.
