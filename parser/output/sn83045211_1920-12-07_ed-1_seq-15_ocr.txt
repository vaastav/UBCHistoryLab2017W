Finances Shew Improvement The nation's finances have shown Barked Improvement during the past rear. The total ordinary receipts of i0,C94,00O,00e for the fiscal year 1020 exceeded these for 1010 by l,54'2.000.00O. while the total net ordinary expenditures decreased from 118.514,0110.000 te $lMO.'U)00,000. The grns public debt, which reached its highest point en August Si. lfllO. when it was ?-0..r08,000.-000. had dropped en November 30, 11)20, te SLM.l'.'.OOO.OOO. There has also been n marked decreased in holdings of government war securi ties bv the banking institutions of the oeiiiitty as well as in the amount of bills held by the 'Federal Reserve Banks secured by government war obligations. This fei lunate result has relieved the banks and left them frter te finance the needs of agri culture, industry and commerce. It 1ms been due In large part te lie' reduction of the public debt, specially of the llentlng debt, but mere particularly te the improved dis tribution of government securities among permanent Investors. The ces sation of the government's borrow ing except through short-term certifi cates of Indebtedness 1ms been n mat ter of great consequence te the peo ple, of the country at large, as well as, te the holders of Liberty bends and Victory notes, and has had an important bearing upon the matter of effective credit control. The j par has been chnractrlzcd by thft progressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dom inant influeuce in that maiket. The future course will necessarily depend upon the extent te which economies ara practiced nnd upon the burdens placed upon the treasury, as well ns upon industrial developments and the maintenance of tax receipts nt n ufticlcntly high level. Rigid Economy Necessary The fundamental fact which at present dominates the government's financial situation is that seven and half billions of its war indebted ness mature within the next two nnd a liulf j ears Of this amount two and a lui'f billions are floating debt and fie liillintiK Victory notes nnd war savings ceitilicates.

Ceudcn, blind chap lain of the Heuse, was offering the opening prayer when tlte camera clicked further payments aggregating possi bly SO.10,000,000 must still be made te the railroads during the current yenr. It Ih obvious that these large payments have already seriously lim ited the government's progress in re tiring the floating debt. Closely cenneded with this it seems te me is the necessity for tin immediate consideration of the revi sion of our tax laws. Simplification of the income and profits taxes hns become nn immediate necessity. These taxes performed nn Indispensable service during the war. The need for their simplification, however, Is Very great, In order te save the taxpayer inconveniences nnd expenses and in order te make his liability mere certain nnd definite. Other and mere detulled recommen dations with regard te taxes will no doubt be laid before you by the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal revenue. Care of Disabled Veterans a Duty It is my privilege te draw te the attention of Congress for very sym pathetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment of former mem bers of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled ns the re sult of their participation in the war. These heroic men can never be paid In money for the service they liatiietlciilly rendered the nation. Tlielr reward will lie rather in real ization of tlie fact that they vindi cated the rights of their country and Hided in Mitegiiardltig civilization. The nation's gratitude must be effectively revenled te them by the most ample prevision for their medi cal care and treatment as well ns for their vocational training department nnd placement. The time hns come when u mere complete program can be formulated nnd mere satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training, nnd I earnestly urge thnt the Congress give the matter its early consideration. Th" secretary of the treasury and the beard for vocational education will outline in their annual reports proposals covering medical care and rehabilitation which I nm sure will engnge your earnest study and command your most generous support. Termlt me te emphasize mice mere the need for action upon certain mat ters upon which I dwelt nt some length In my message te the second session of the sixty-sixth Cengress: The necessity, for example, of en couraging the manufacture of dye stuffs nnd related chemicals; the im portance of doing everj thing possible te promote ngriculturnl production along economic lins, te improve ag ricultural marketing nnd te mske rural life mere attractive nnd health lul : the need for a law regulating cold storage in such a way as te limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, preserving the method of disnesing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and requiring goods released from stor age in till cases te hear the date of their receipt. It would also be most serviceable if it were provided thnt all goods re leased from cold storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each purkage the selling or mar ket price at which they went Inte hterase. In order that the purchaser might he able te le.nn what 'profits steed between him and the producer or the vvholesale dealer. Indeed, It would be very service able te the public if all goods destined for Interstate commerce were made te carry upon every packing case whose form made It possible a plain statement of the prhe nt which they left the hands of the producer. I respectfully call eiir uttentieu, also, te thn recommendations of the mes sage referred te with regard te a fed eral llcensn for all corporations en gaged in interstate commerce. In hi lef, the immediate legislative need of the time is the removal of all obstacles te the realization of the best ambitions of our people in their several classes of employment nnd the strengthening of nil Instrumentalities by which difficulties are te be met and removed mid justice denlt out, whether h law or by some form of mediation ami conciliation. I de net feel it te be my privilege at pres ent te suggest the detailed and par ticular methods by which these ob jects limy he attained, but I have faith that the inquiries of your sev eral committees will discover the way nnd the method. Ijo.'iii te Armenia Urged In response te what I believe te be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the I'nlted States, I earn estly suggest that the Cengrcm use the treasury of the I'nlted States te make te the btruggling government of Armenia such i Jean as was iiiuile te several of the allied governments dur ing tlii war; nnd I would also sug gest thnv It would be desirnble te pie vide In the legislation itself that tlie expenditure of the money thus leacied should be under the supervision of n commission, or at least n commis sioner, from tlie United State in order thut revolutionary tendencies within Armeniu itself might net be nfferded by the lean a further tempt ing opportunity. Favers Philippine Independence Allew me te call your uttentieu te the fact that the people el the Phil ippine islnnds have succeeded In maintaining u stable government since the Inst nctien of tlie Congress iu their behalf, and hnve thus ful filled thi condition set by the Con gress no precedent te u consideration of grinting independence te the Is lnnds, I respectfully submit that this condition pieeedent having been fill filled, it is new our liberty uud our duty te keep our promlae-to-tho pee DYMiNa ptstejic-

WILSON'S MESSAGE PERSONAL DOCUMENT s Ry CLINTON W. GILRKRT CepvrigM, 1120, by 1'ubitc Lcilecr Ce. Washington, Dec. 7. President Wll son's last annual message te Congress Is n highly peiseiial document. It ends with u declaration that it is confes sion of faith, rather than u formal mes nigc. Mr. Wilsen writes : "I have net se much luid before jeu u series of iccommcndatieus, gentlemen, ns sought te utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred und which it Is my solemn purpose purpose te stand by until my last lighting eny. I lit ... . ... - .. llevc this te be the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of nil the victories which awuit national action In the days te come, whether in Ameri ca or elsewhere." Written in this personal vein, the last utterance of that personal govern ment which the voters have nt least for this once rejected, the message bears every mark of the intention the Presi dent cherished up te the inst memeut of delivering it in person te Congress, us he delivered all his messages up till the time when sickuesis overtook him, mere than a year iig,). Se persistent wns the President in this desire, that up till this morning the White Heuse was net sure that he would net go te the Capitel In spite of the advice of physicians nnd friends. Yields te Physician's Advice The President in tlie end yielded te the advice of Admiral (iraybeu, but Secretary Tumulty was se much in doubt ns te his intentions that he came te the White Heuse dressed for- 20 All English Overcoats All Heme-Built Overcoats All New Winter Suits All Tailoring Cleths All Evening Clethes Our entire stocks are open te Christmas buy ers te cheese as they will and save 20'e.

It Is n part of the tragedy of the President's final service In office thnt he should cling obstinately te the idea nf personally addressing the American people nnd thnt the state of his health should rob him of tin opportunity of delivering himself what Is te all intents and purposes his farewell address. The message Is bare of recommenda tions except rnther perfunctory sug gestions of measures, most of which Congress will net have time te consider in the few months that remain until Mnrch !, The President addresses deaf ears as a President always does who Is in the linnl months of his service, anil who sneaks te n Congress which has gene ever te the opposition. And the President knows he Is writing te u body which is waiting for the coming of th' new administration. Silent en Treaty On tlie subject which Is uenrest te his heart the treaty and the league of Nations, Mr. Wilsen says nothing, and he Is keeninc his tilnns se much te him self since the issue arose as te whether he should go te the Capitel or net that no one- knows with certainty what his plans with respect te the treaty are. l'Vem the fnct that he left out all refer ence, even indirect, te the situation created by the failure of the treaty, It is assumed thnt he will later address u special message te the Senate nnd send the treaty back te it for consider censider nilnn. Ills friends exnect him te fel low this course. When he does this lie may again insist upon personally ap pearing ut the Capitel. Thn i-wnmniendntlens which the Pres ident does make touch chiefly the budget. the need of economy and in general me reconstruction problems which the war has left In its wake. Budget Rill law Forecast President-elect Harding's plea te the Semite vesterday te co-operate with the t-' nilmlnlnrrntlnn may result the passage of the budget bill law. The fate of this measure in the short ses sion is in doubt. The Republican at one time planned te put the measure through, but lately they have been in clined te stand their ground and refuse te modify the bill te meet the Presi dent's constitutional objections raised in n veto message Inst yenr. Mr. Hard- lint is said te regard tne issue uui yet worth fighting about Mr. Wilsen's fiuancinl I uregrams tlif .....-- fer radically from thnt which thti Hard ing administration is likely te fellow. This issue will net arise In what re mnins of Mr Wilsen's term. The President recommends that the. govern ment pnv off out of income the llentlng debt und" part of the Victory Lean nnd war savings t ertlticntes which fall due within the next two and ene-hnlf years. Ti.n t,.tnl nt this debt seen iiutturinc is S7 nun. lltlO. 000. a lurnc sum te pay off out of income in two nnd n hnlf yenrs. The Republican plnn is te refund most of this indebtedness in long term bends. Either plan has its difficulties, for the market for further government bend." is bad. Te uttempt paying off a large pint of this debt out of Income meuns high taxes The Republicans nic net llltclv te heed Mr. Wilsen's declaration thnt' sound finance requires this, course. It is the only sharp party issue out lined in the message. There cannot be much difference of opinion about caring for the disabled soldiers or protecting the new industries which sprang up during the war or encouraging agricul ture or regulating cold storage.

Councilman Develln virtually chal lenged Judge Rrewn, president judge of the court, te attempt the ex-n-eisr of the threatened mandamus te restore the positions, provided Council would cut them out. Mr. Reper presented statistics show ing, by comparison with the operntlen costs of the Municipal Court, of Chi cago, the extravagant administration of Judge Rrevvn's court. Reth coun ceun cllnien told of n personal Investi gation which they had made of the Municipal Court In this city In which they visited the various brnnchca and as a result of which they found upwards of 100 probation officers who appeared te have nothing te de but draw their salaries. They found men drawing salaries as irobatlen officers acting In ether doubt ful and uncertain lines of work. The real work of nrobntien officers, they declared, weg in the main being done by women whose salaries mnged from $1200 te $1500. Fall te Receive Support The arraignment of the Munclpnl Court administration enme when the SI, 000,000 budget item was cnlled up for linnl action before belnc sent te Council finance committee with ether department budgets. In the discussion net one councilman en the adminis tration side of the chamber raised his voice te support Ceuncllnien Reper nnd Develln. The Vnre side of the cham ber, led bv Councilman Oaffncy nnd Councilman Hall, mode no attempt te nnswer the argumenta nf Air. Koper and Mr. Develin. Reth talked a let about the geed work the Municipal Court was doing and charged thnt Messrs. Reper and Develln were taking n un- tnr iwlvnntnirp in nttnrklnr the pnurf when Its budget had already been passed en tentatively. itatlvely. fhlch Mr. Reper sought te ram the $1,000,000 budget .e of six court criers, six Positions which Mr. Reper sought te hnve struck from Included these of six court janitors. 186 probation officers, twenty stenographers, seven filing clerks, four firemen nnd one secretary. Mr. Koper explained that that would result in a saving of about $200,000 without hampering the operation of the real court work. Reper Opens Attack In opening his attack en the Munici pal Court jobs. Councilman Reper de clared he made n comparison with the Municipal Court of Chicago. "That court," he said, ''was the basis en which the Muuiclpnl Court iu Phila delphia was established, and both courts arc conducted along somewhat similar Hues. The 1010 report of Chicago shows that there are thirty judges In that court. The total cost of these judges nnd the probation officers neces sary te operate the court business Is about $303,725. Here In Philadelphia our probation officers alone cost nearly $484,000 aud with thn nine Judges the amount Is about $5.10,820, "In Chicago the number of cases handled in the civil and municipal branches of the Municipal Court are ten times the number handled In the Municipal Court here. Reth Mr. Deve lln and myself went te .ludge lirevvn s court and Mr. Merrow, the chief clerk, could pointenlytofour probation officers getting mere than $1800 a year, who were doing anything. Most of the work aecmed te be in the hnndH of women. He told us there were eleven probation December ?, 1020 eflicers helping out In Quarter Sessions Court. We found one probation officer at lvventy-tlrst and Weed streets act ing as a gatekeeper and at an informa tion desk nnd he bad eight men detailed te help him. "The whole trouble Is thnt the court has run away with itself. It's running n hospital without warrant of law They told us they have a probation of ficer nt the Heuse of Correction te talk te the prisoners and also at the county prisons. There Is Warden McKcnty at the Kastern Penitentiary, who gets along with epe probation officer and the Quarter Sesalens Court has one for nil its criminals. Why the Municipal Court has get te have oil these men is beyond reason. "Chief Clerk Merrow told us the court sent out about 200 letters a day. why they want sixty-two stenographers for that I vden't knew. I believe forty would be mere than enough, uud that would give only each stenographer about nine or ten pieces of paper a day te handle. Council gets along with three janitors and the Municipal Court ought te be able te get along with ten Instcatl of asking for sixteen."
