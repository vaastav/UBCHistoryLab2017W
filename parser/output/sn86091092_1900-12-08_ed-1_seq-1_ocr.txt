Below are give a few of the Presi dents recomendation to Congress as given n his late message. URGKS action on trusts. "In my last annual message to the Congress I call attention to the necessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to ex ist in connection with the combi nations of capital organized into trusts, and again invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time, which concluded with these words: "It is apparent that uniformity oflegislation upon this subject in the several states is much to be de sired, it is to be hoped that such uniformity, founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations may be obtained, and that means may be found for Congress, within the limitations of it constitutional power, so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of laws through out the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutory rules to which I have re ferred." "The whole question is so im portant and far reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly con sidered, but every phase of it will have to be made the subject of de liberation of Congress', resulting in wise and judicious action. •'Restraint upon such combin ations as are injurious and which are within federal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the Congress. 

FOREIGN trade IMMENSE. "Our foreign trade shows a re markable record of commercial and industrial progress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in the history of our country exceeds $2,000,000,000. The ex ports are greater then they have ev er been before, the total for the fis cal year 1900 being $1 ,394,483,082, an increase over 1899 of $167,459, 780, an increase over 1898 of $163, 000,752: over 1897 of $343,489,526, and greater than 1896 by $511,876, 144. "The growth of manufactures in the United States is evidenced by the fact that exports of manfactur ed products largely exceed those of any previous year, their value for 1900 being $433,851,756, against $339-562,146, in 1899 an increase °f 28 per cent.' "Agricultural products were also exported during 1900 in greater volume than in 1898, the total for the year being $835,858^23, against $784,776,142 in 1899, The imports for the year amount ^ to $849,841,184, an increase ov er 1899 of $152,792,695. This in crease is largely in materials for manufacture and is in response to the rapid development of manufact u »ng in the United States. While ere was imported for use in man ufactures 1900 material to the value $79i768, 972 in excess of 1899 it js reassuring to observe that there is tendency toward decrease in the Portation of articles manufactur ed ready for consumption which in •900 formed 15.17 per cent of the total imports against 15.14 per cent m 1899, and 21.09 per cent i° 1896. urges cut in war revenue. I recomend that the congress in session reduce the internal revenue tox imposed to meet the expenses the war with Spain in the sum $3 .000,000. This reduction should be secured by the remission these taxes which experiance 35 s hone to be the most burden ^We to the industries of the peo ple. I especially urge, that there be deluded in whatever reduction is Bla ^e the legacy tax on bequests for public uses of a literary, edu cational or charitable character. warns against extravagance. In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it invites in extravagance in government ex penditures and appropriations, and the chosen representatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish ex ample in their legislation of that wise economy in which in a season of plenty husbands for the future. In this era of great business activi ty and opportunity caution is not untimely. It will not abate, but strengthen our confidence. It will not retard, but promote legitimate industrial and commercial expan sion. Our growing power brings with it temtatious and perils requir ing constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to invite conflicts or oppression, but fur the more effective maintenance of those prin ciples of equality and justice upon which our .institutions depend. I v et us keep always in mind that the foundation of our government is liberty, its superstructure peace. URGES PACIFIC CABLE. "I renew the recommendation made in my special message of Feb. 10, 1899, as to the necessity for ca ble communications between U. S . and Hawaii, with extension to Ma nila. Since then circumstances have strikingly emphasized this need. Surveys have shown the en tire feasibillity of a chain of cables which at each stopping place shall touch 011 American territory, so that the system shall be under our own complete control. Manila once within telegraphic reach, connec tion with the systens of the Asiatic coast would be increased, and profit able opportunities for a more direct route from our shores to the Orient than is now afforded by the trans Atlantic, continental and trans Asiatic lines. I urge attention to this important matter. (Continued to 2d Page.) ISTHMIAN CANAL. As respects the trans-Isthmian ship canal, the full report of the Walker Commission is going to be available for the guidance of Con gress. Probably the commission will take the ground that it would be practicable to build the Panama Canal, but that for the purposes of the United States the Nicargaua route would be preferable. American sentiment, so far as it now has been formed, is clearly in favor of the Nicraagua route. The public is also in favor of the ownership of the canal by the United States Govern ment and its construction out of the national treasury. Let us hope that the opinion will prevail that it is neither dignified nor safe for the sovereign government of the United States to construct a great public work like this canal upon alien soil. Whatever the initial difficulties may be, the one simple and clear solution of all questions involved in the future control 'of the canal lies in the ac quisition by our government of full sovereignity over such a strip of land as may be needed for canal purposes. We have made some annexations of territory under President McKin ley's administration, but none that could be compared in importance with the annexation of the requisite strip of territory in Central Ameri ca. Sooner or lator such annexa tion is bound to come; audit will be much better to accomplish it in ad vance of the construction of a costly canal than to bring ic about by force at some future period. To succeed in such a piece of negotiation would count for more, in the estimation of future generations of Americans, than any other of the diplomatic achievements of Mr. McKinley - From "The Progress of the World in the American Monthly Reviews 0/Reviews for December. 

IRRIGATION CONGRESS NOTES The telegram sent by the Na tional Irrigation Congress at Chi cago, urging upon President Mc Kinley the importance of the irri gation and forestry problem and re questing him to in turn urge upon Congress the advisability of some definite action, has done more to direct public attention to these im portant national questions than any other one thing. The telegram was as follows: To the President: The ninth an nual session of the National Irri gation Congress now in session in the City of Chicago, respectfully urges that in your niessage to Con gress you call attention to the na tional importance of the preserva tion of our forests and of the exten tiou and conservative use of the forest preserves, and further that you emphasize the need of national action to store the flood waters that now go to waste. "Save the Forests and Store the Floods" proved a popular motto at the Chicago Irrigation Congress. Its sessions bore a marked atmos phere of thoughtful consideration of how these great objects could be accomplished and a general spirit of harmony and co-operation per vaded the atmosphere. Much sat isfaction was expressed at the growth of the national irrigation sentiment in the East and the in terest and active co-operation af forded by eastern business men. Great as is Chicago, with her people equaling in numbers a third of the entire population of the western half of the United States, yet the National Irrigation Con gress was recognized as the expon ent of a national movement, and caused no little local and general comment. Chicago newspapers de voted their columns to its meetings and Chicago's largest business men attended them. The great prob lem of the reclamation of the mill ions of arid acres was recognized at its true value and the incalculable benefits to result, appreciated. The national standing of the national irrigation question is an assured fact. The following resolutions were adopted by the Congress: "We hail with satisfaction the fact that both of the great political parties of the nation in the last campaign declared in favor of the reclamation of arid America, in or der that settlers might build homes on the public domain, and to that end we urge upon Congress that national appropriations commensur ate with the magnitude of the problem should be made for the preservation of the forests and the reforestation of denuded areas as natural storage reservoirs and for the construction by the National Government as part of its policy of internal improvement of storage reservoirs and other works for flood protection and to save for use in aid of navigation and irrigation the waters which now run to waste and for the development of artesian and subterranean sources of water supply. "The waters of all Streams should forever remain subject to public control and the right of the use of water for irrigation should inhere in the land irrigated, and beneficial use be the basis of measure and the limit of the right. "The work of building the reser voirs necessary to store the floods should be done directly by the gov ernment under existing statutes re lating to the employment of labor and hours of work and under laws that will give to all American citi zens a free and equal opportunity to get first employment, and then a home on the land. "We commend the efficient work of the various bureaus of the na tional government in the investiga tion of the physical and legal prob lems and other conditions relating to irrigation and in promoting the adoption of more effective laws, customs and methods of irrigated agriculture, and urge upon Con gress the necessity of providing liberal appropriations for this im portant work." The holding of the National Ir rigation Congress in the East, as it turned out was a wise move. The people of that half of the country have had the subject of national irrigation brought home to them in a manner not otherwise possible. The far-reaching importance of the problem has been presented to them and a genuine interest has been awakened. Instead of find ing opposition in the East, the Con gress found that eastern men of prominence were more than inter ested in a proposition which prom ised an increased western popula tion of millions of people. As the "enemy's country" has been invaded, the myth of eastern opposition has faded away and its people are found to be anxious to see inaugurated a national policy of western arid land reclamation. The western delegates went home with the feeling that they have the hearty support of eastern interests in securing action which will open to settlement half a continent, cap able of supporting fifty millions of people. They cannot but feel that this support is growing; that it is developing into a great movement; that many people are realizing that national action would meet such a western development as would in crease the national wealth beyond measure. The time seems fully ripe for the west to take a firm and decided stand on the question of national irrigation and something great may be accomplished at once. Why not? It is as right that Congress should appropriate money for stor age reservoirs as for river and har bor improvements. The building of storage reservoirs would obviate the necessity for much river ex penditure and would be vastly in creased. And now if the West makes this demand the East will back it up, for the benefit would not be local. Every western paper is interested in seeing this development accom plished. What would be the re sult of an appropriation of eight or ten million dollars spent annually in the west for irrigation construc tion? The immediate stimulation would be enormous and the future benefit greater. This policy should be inaugurated and the western press should urge it with one voice. It is a national matter; it can be productive only of great good; the East is responsive; will the West be aggressive; it is time to work. It is the opinion at Washington that $40,000,000 will be appropri ated by this congress for river and harbor improve ments. Of this the western half of the United States will get, judging by previous records a couple of million or so. Whatever are her possibilities, it is not contended that the West is as important or in fluential as the East. She has not yet the dense population; but why should she not get at least a share of this great appropriation? Why should she not get a fourth of it, to be applied to the building of great storage reservoirs to be filled with flood waters for use in irrigation, un der a system of internal improve ments? The government is spending large sums in aiding In the devel opment of foreign trade and the op ening of foreign markets for Amer ican manufacturers. It is believed that we should push out goods into every market of the world and sell them. The belief is also gaining ground that the government should also develop its home market for American products and manufac turers. This it could do by re claiming the 75,000,000 acres of western arid land and settling them with thousands of industrious home builders. Eastern merchants are more than willing to see such an undertaking. The west should take the initiative. S. H. M.
