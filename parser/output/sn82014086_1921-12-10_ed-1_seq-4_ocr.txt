'While' the change like the elimination of grade crossings la desirable It must come about gradually. Wooden, coaches cost about ?8,000 apiece while the steel coach costs 1 18.000 and yet In spite of the greater cost there were 19852 of the lat ter at the beginning of this year against 629 in 1909 and a gain of 8532 steel un-dre-trame cars while during that period the wooden passenger coaches had de creased to 32,128 from over 50,000. This while indicating the gradual elimtna-j Hon of the wooden cars shows that there are nearly as many , steel and steel un-4 derframe cars in use as there are wood en cars and that a general policy of re placement would make the change com plete within the next decade,- or soon after. Thus the change Is one that is steadily taking place without the action being required by law and with im proved conditions the substitution seems likely to proceed faster.

TALKS Reward follows service as a logical sequence, but the character of -the re ward is determined by the nature of the service. If it is material service thatihaa been rendered, then it will be material reward expected and received. A man is never paid for being good any more than ne is for being bright. It, is only when these qualities are put to action that re ward comes, and the reward is always along the line of the quality exercised. A bright man, who may also be a sAad man, writes a book, but it is the quahty of his head rather than the condition of his heart that sells it. The reward for thinking straight Is dollars and cents. The reward for living straight is the consciousness of being in right relations with God. There is no comparison be tween the two rewards. Qf course living rightly puts all of a man's faculties In the best condition for working normally, and yet simply because he"a Christian he has no promise of being well "stocked In this worlda goods. Do we as Americans have some reason for thanking God for a period of financial depression? Sounds queer, doesn't it? But listen t After long years of extra prosperity, the American people have be come obsessed with materialism. In many instances money has become the only thing, and in most cases the chief thing, to be desired, sought for and ob tained. The tendency Is for the grosser things of life to crowd out the finer in stincts of the soul. We have reached that pitch where we see nothing but money, moneys, money, by day, and dream about It by night. We are getting so that we rate everything by money values. Of course no sensible person underrates the place that money must reasonably occupy in the conduct of the world's material things. But the point is that the mate rial is not the chief goal in life to be reached, and when men seem to be striving for that chiefly, the Almighty brings us up with a jolt, and shows us' other things to be gained, and if in this He succeeds,- a business depression is a blessing. Alons this line I am rerhinded of what James T. Fields, the noted publisher and lecturer, said: "Isn't it amazing that in 20 yeairs no American college has pro duced one man who has gained an Inter national reputation for eminence in any department of literature?" This was BELIEVES CABINET SHOULD HAVE FLOOR PRIVILEGE The National Economic League re-' cently sent out the questions shown below to representative business a id professional men in every state- ask ing for a "yes" or "no" -i' h comments or qualifications if desira ble. By an almost unanimous vote, an unqualified . affirmative is return ed on these propositions: (1) For open, visible, executive leadership in matters of nationa fi mance and administration 96; (2) for a budget preparedunder the direction of the president; and ex plained and .defended on the floor of congress by the cabinet 95; (3) for change of the rules of con gress to give the cabinet the privi leges of the floor without a right to vote; 92; (4) for changes in statute law mak ing it the duty of the cabinet to take leadership before congress and the country in matters of finance and ad ministration 84; (5) for amendment to the Constitu tion to provide for such procedure, in case congress refuses to make the necessary changes in rules and stat ute law 72. The principle of publicity and popu lar control embodied in these meas ures has been held to be so impor tant that it has been incorporated in every democratic constitution o Eu rope adopted within the ' last century In Great Britain this procedure was adopted voluntarily by parliament, by change of rules. In other European countries it has been- imposed on the representative branch by their writ ten constitutions. Congress has the power to force our political leader ship into the open. If it refuses to ,change its rules to provide for open forum discussion in matters of finance and administration, the only recourse is constitutional amendment. This course, if necessary, is favored by 72 of the 100 members of the na tional council of the Economic league who took part in this referendum. Under the present system leader ship in these matters, it is explained, is vested in the chairman of congres sional committee of which there were spoken at least 20 years ago, and is j last year 7'6 in the house and senate to- more tuliy true now than then. During : seiner. j.ne aeieat or tne recently en this nearly half century has there arisi-n ! acted budget law, it is pointed out, is In our midst a. poet to be compared with ' tnat although prepared by an execu- ecutive budget. The plan out lined does provide for an executive initiation of the budget, but the presi dent's responsibility ends when he has prepaid the budget and transmitted "(t wf congress. To that extent, and that extent alone, does the plan pro vide for an executive budget." It is stated by the league, in crit icism of the measure, that it will not give us "visible" government; that it will not fix responsibility in a way to help the voter; that the only way ex ecutive heads can be made responsible and the voter intelligent is to require the cabinet to appear personally be fore the appropriating, representative branch, and explain and defend their acts and proposals; that such an open-forum enqounter .between the ad ministration and its opponents win make news; and that it is only through the news columns that 40,01)0,000 voters can be reached. Members of the cabinet cannot now appear on the floor or take part in the discussions of congress. They appear before congressional committees only when special permission is given. If the secretary of commerce, for exam ple, desires to Jiave any question of finance or administration discussed bearing on any of these subjects, he cannot appear personally before the house, but must work through one or another of the leaders of some twenty odd committees. The National Economic league be lieves that with the exception of in ternational relations this-subject is the most important one Ieore the coun try at the present time. The national council of the league, to which the questions were submit ted to be voted upon, is composed of leading men from all parts of the country. The purpose of the league is simply to give expression to the pi Cl'BA-SOlTBERN

Dr. Cleveland, who was the chair man of President Taft's economy commission, in a memorandum prepar ed for the committee of the league, states that those who have opposed open forum budget discussion have based their reasoning;, in opposition, largely on constitutional grounds: that to permit the executive to pre pare, present and publicly explain and defend a plan or program for which appropriations are asked and money must be raised would be at variance with the underlying principles of the American Constitution. As republi can leader in congress, Mr. Cannon opposed the executive budget idea pro posed by President Taft. Mr. Fitzger ald, a democratic leader in congress, and following him Mr. Sheriey took the same position. The language used by Mr. Cannon in a recent article is that such a procedure would be "away from the budget plans of those- who ' prepared the Constitution, and when congress consents to the , executive makirilr a budget it will have surren dered tho most important part of leg islative government." In this relation it is noted that this was not the view taken by Washing ton, who sat as chairman through the constitutional convention. It was not the view of Hamilton, one of the three great expositors of the Consti tution In the campaign before the peo ple for- its adoption. They both under stood that the Constitution made it the duty of the executive to come be fore congress to give an account of stewardship and to explain plans for the future, in support of which appro priations were asked. But when Ham ilton, representing the President, ask ed the pleasure of the house, th lead ers in this body refused to permit him to come before them. The prop osition has since been supported by some f our greatest constitutional lawyers who have come to hold exe cutive and judicial positions. But it is not necessary to go to the opinions " of men v.ho have occupied executive and judicial positions to sup port the proposition that a change in the rules to bring the cabinet on the floor would be both constitutional and American. This, view has been staunch ly maintained by members of the on ly congressional committee ever ap pointed to inquire into the question. In their report made in 1881 they con clude that neither of the constitution al objections to giving to the Crbinet the privileges of the floor is sound. On the first point, that such a change of rules in inhibited by the provisions that no person holding office shall be a member of either house, they had this to say: "The provision of the Constitution that 'no person holding any office; un der the United States shall be a mem ber of either house during his term of office' is in no wise violated.
