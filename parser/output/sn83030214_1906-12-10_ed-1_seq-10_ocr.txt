STOCKS RELATIVELY STROXG IX FACE OF IIK,II Bdink Reserves Low, and Little Prospect of Easy Money in the Rent of the Year — Trade Situation Responsible for Stiff Loan Quotations. THE WEEK IN WALL STREET. If the Industries of the country should be Krriously injured by the present condition of the money market, there would be ample rea- Fon for lull! * ■■ in stock market circles, but ; Wall Street docs not believe that business j throughout the land -will be affected by high rates for accommodation beyond the influence of a temporary burden imposed upon borrow ers*. So the Street is not soiling its securities. Naturally there are efforts by the bear clement to depress values on the strength of high money, but declines arc not extensive, and are about ns quickly recovered us made. An exorbitant price for call funds lends to restrict speculation by people who have to depend upon borrowed money and low bank reserves increase the ex pense of speculative operations, while they make necessary, in the absence of other forms of re lief, the calling in of loans as a matter of pro tection to the reserve which is demanded held by law as a safeguard for depositors. An ex travagant figure for demand loans is now cur rent — a rate which i? not warranted by the actual position of the money market, and which reflects the advantage bankers are taking of the low condition of Clearing House reserves to main a fancy return on the accommodation they extend to operators in stocks who are willing to renew their loans in order to hold their specu lative accounts. In the firm belief that profits will be secured from an eventual advance in stock quotations that will offset present exces sive lending rates. These money quotations are not hurting the mercantile community, as the business of the country is nut. conducted on call funds, but it is conceivable that if time money and commercial paper should rule at the pre vailing figures indefinitely the nation's trade and commerce would be most adversely affected. "Wall Street is being anathematized in various quarters where intelligence is far under par for present money market conditions. A certain ele ment in Wall Street is responsible for the ab normal rates for call money, but the call money situation is not injuring the public, and it does not reflect a scarcity of funds for actual busi ness operations where borrowers are willing to jay the legal rate and a commission. Wall Street speculation is not responsible for the Stringency In the, money market, proof of which is found In the movement of currency in the last eljc months, and. in fact, throughout the year. in the movement of loans of the associated banks and in the course of trading on the Stock Exchange, 'i here has been no wild speculation, and there has been no active buying of securities on marsh) account. The public is not in the market, and has not been for many months, the bulk of the recent trading having 'boon for pro fessional account and in the interest of people ho are the chief owners of securities and who have been well supplied with time funds to carry them to a period when rates for loans will de cline to an easier basis. If there were a large public following In the market monetary strin gency would bring about a big decline In values, but there is no Important weakness; Indeed, tho market presents surprising strength, attesting the fact that securities are In the hands of people who know that fundamental conditions are sound, and that in the end these conditions will carry prices to better figures. In the face of 36 per cent , money last week there was no im poriant liquidation, and it Is quite probable that if In the current week sales should be made as a result of Saturday's poor bank statement sub slant buyers will stand ready with open bags to gather the offerings of those who may be com pelled or frightened Into parting with their spec ulative or investment holdings. Trade activity throughout the country and a currency system which locks up the people's money In the vaults of the federal Treasury have been the chief factors in tho reduction In the bank reserves at this centre and for th« high rates that merchants are compelled to pay for accommodation. New York has im ported, net, upward of ?50,000,000 gold in the last ten months; it has received large amounts of government deposits and has put out addi tional banknote circulation; yet the local in stitutions have nothing to show for this In crease in the amount of money in circulation except a deficit In reserve*, tho interior having taken for trade purposes vast sums which have helped to move record breaking crops and to place the country on a basis of prosperity un equalled in the history of the land. One of these days our currency system will be reformed on lines that automatically will Increase and de crease the amount of money available for trade purposes as the needs of the situation demand, and it is fortunate that some of our Congress men at least are at last waking up to the fact of the pressing necessity for a revision of our currency laws. President Roosevelt and Secre tary Shaw are urging Congress to do some thing, so also is the Controller of the Currency, while bankers In most parts of tho United States are talking and writing and resolving that a crisis Is Impending, and that Congress must act in order to sate the country. Lack of cur rency reform will not plunge the country into bankruptcy, but remedial legislation will in crease the chances of permanent prosp rlty. So far there has been an unusually light movement of money from th> interior to this centre, ship ments from hfie having far exceeded receipts. and it is not likely that there will be a large return Bow <>f currency from the "We«=t until alter th*-. turn of the year. Hence it follows that unless there should be extensive govern ment deposits with th»» banks or heavy ship ments of gold from Europe to this side of th* ocean stiff figures for loans will prevail until aft^r the end of the present month. Though sterling exchange has been declining, the pros pects of gold imports are not promising, as the Hank of England is maintaining its rate at a per cent, with the probability of advancing it In the event of an American Inquiry for the precious metal. The President's message, the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury and of the Controller of tho Currency, the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury to prepay interest on govern ment bonds, due from January to May, the meet ing of the Chamber of Commerce, at which the accusation was made by a prominent banker that certain Institutions were manipulating the money market and the proposition suggested that the Clearing House and the Stock Exchange should devise a method to control call rates; thy Increase In the New York Central and other gander bill roads dividends, the Bale of the Pennsylvania holdings of the Chesapeake & Ohio, the declaration of a dividend on the com mon stock of the American Car and Foundry Company, the first since 1904; strength In th« copper and steel market and the weakness in NipLaaing on the curb were among the factors of the week that created an abundance of talk in speculative circles, but which exerted little influence on t Stock market trading. Dealing throughout the six days Of business were rel atively light, while price fluctuations were con fined within narrow limits in the greater num ber of Issues. Canadian Pacific being one of the chief exception*. This stock enjoyed a net gain of OS Points. Canadian Pacific is m active de mand for London account, and the people who are buying it believe that It eventually will sell a* high as Great Northern Business conditions In the country nr so promising that conservative holders of Ameri -an investment securities see no reason t.. sell their stocks and bonds, and the unnlllini I of tlr^e people to .1!?r">-*e of their possessions, : 

DAILY TRIBUNE, MONDAY. DECEMBER 10. 19(16. MOXEV RATES. despite the fact that prices are attractively high, will prove an important element of strength in any disturbance that may develop as a result of extreme rates for money in the present month. Railroad earnings now coming to hand for the month of October and for November show al most without exception, large gains over' the corresponding period a year ago, and these re sults, in connection with other known factors representing trade expansion, naturally are ef fective arguments In encouraging the expec tation that in the new year prices on the Stock Exchange will move to a materially higher level . despite the fact that In many instances quotations already fully measure the worth of the Issues, as represented by their investment * I' I IX I* II.
