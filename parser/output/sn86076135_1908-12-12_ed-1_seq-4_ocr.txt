We believe a synopsis better than giving the message verbatim in this case, for in each section of the message the president elaborates upon his theme, making a long document. Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps the most versatile man who has ever been in the presidential chair not, perhaps, that he is our greatest president, for Washington, Grant; the beloved man of sorrow, Abraham Lincoln; and our late revered McKinley, all rose to great crises in a manner which has made the name of "American" respected by all nations. Roosevelt has not beeg face to face with, and through, any such crises as were these men, but his attention has been turned more to economic and business conditions and de velopment. And In handling the peace conditions of the country he has shown a capacity for work, a quick understanding, and a gen eral and correct knowledge of what was going on in all sections of the nation and in all departments of his government which has been at once the marvel and in some parts of congress, the despair of that body. His messages are masterpieces and fearless. In the present message, it is significant of the absolute honesty and fairness of the man that while making broader recommenda tions for the protection and welfare of the laboring man than any prior president has ever done, life at Hie same time scores some of labor's leaders for their attack upon the judiciary of the United States and their attempt to legalize the blacklist, the boycott and personal violence In the name of a "strike." In no uncertain words he states that the great Interstate corporations must be so super vised that they observe both the letter and the spirit of the law, and yet must be given opportunity""to develop their various Industries to the greatest extent in a legal manner. He states that th'e administration of justice must be prompt, and sure, that the workingman may be on an equal footing with the capitalist In the courts of law. And some of his most ringing sen tences are to the efTect that in sickness, In disability, or in old age. the man who has given himself, body and soul, to the government service, or the service of the great corporations worn out or crip pled himself In that service shall be cared for by those to whom he has devoted his best years and efforts. That Is not politics, it is not law, but it is right. It is Socialism which has been purified from Socialism; Republicanism refined to troy weight, the utterance of a man who feels for his fellow men. The president's message also shows that he sees that the pros perity of a nation is measured according to the development of natural or acquired resources; that he sees that the natural re sources of the United States are greater than those of any other na tion of the world, that they must be developed, but at the same time be developed in such a manner that they are perpetuated for the benefit of generations yet unborn. And these resources, this natural wealth, must be guarded so that no nation will ever try to tresspass upon it. It is for this reason that he urges the construc tion of a navy which can not only hold its own, but defeat the navy of any other nation of the world, and. an army which can equally well protect its borders. It is for this reason that he believes the' na tional guard should be brought to the, efficiency of the regular army, practically a huge body of patriots trained In military man euvors and discipline, fully armed and equipped, ready at practical ly a moment's notice to take the field, armed, provisioned and train ed for actual combat. , All this Is not for war, but for peace. The hanker does not leave his gold piled on his counters, but surrounds It with Intricacies of steel, electricity, and cunning mechanical de vices sp that the would be thief is repelled, not attracted. Our army and navy is but a gigantic safe, warding off calamity. Rooseveits last letter all his letters show him not to be the Roosevelt of the "big stick," but the man of peace, but who, like a skilled physician, applies the knife to business, political and civic tumors, not In anger, but in sorrow; not in warfare, bnt that healing and peace may be the ultimate result; who applies precautionary measures rather than to try to cure after a plague has broken out. OUR 

GREATEST CHARITY. Some time ago the Tonopah Bonanza contained an editorial which elucidated upon the hardships worked upon the Common People by the arbitrary rates fixed by great corporations which control the mar ket" in their respective commodities, whether It be oil, transporta tion, or gum drops. The editorial called forth the following letter from W. S. Miller, who, it appears from the stationery upon which he writes and from his "official hand and seal," Is the treasurer of the Standard Oil company, In San Francisco. We will take his word, and the stationery, for all that. Mr. Miller's letter follows: "San Francisco, Dec. 4, 1908. , "Editor Bonanza: "Our attention hus been called to an article which recently ap peared in your newspaper reading as follows: " 'Down on the coast, coal oil Standard Oil coal oil or kero sene sells at 16c to 20c per gallon, according to the weight of Oily John Rockefeller's donations to church or school. The selling rate Is fixed arbitrarily by the Standard Oil company. In Tonopah the Standard Oil says: "Sell kerosene at 60c per gallon." . And that Is what Tonopah pays for kerosene. Is there legality or justice In that?' "You have evidently been misinformed as to the facts In this case, and we most respectfully ask If you would not publish In your paper the fact that the Standard Oil company doeB not make any ef fort to control, nor can it control, the selling prices at which mer chants sell their goods to the consumers. "The prices which the Standard Oil company get for their Coal oil or kerosene at Tonopah are: In Iron barrels, 26 c per gallon, and In cases, 33V4c per gallon. The prices at Tonopah are necessar lly higher Uian they would be on the coast, on account of the high rates of freight. The fancy grades of kerosene, like eocene and elalne, are sold by the Standard Oil company at 37c per gallon for eocene and 43c per gallon or elalne. "The prices t which these goods are sold In San Francisco can be found In any of the San Francisco dally newspapers. ' "Yours truly, etc." All of which reminds us of the member of the English hoiiRe of lords, who, after some flagrant violation of the rules of that decorous body, was required to go down on his kneeB before the speaker's stand, and apologize to the house, else forfeit his seat. His lord ship demurred, but finally took his medicine, gracefully, albeit SATURDAY. W. W.

Gotwaldt, of the Goldfield News, and a Bonanza repre sentative, under the guidance of Foreman Robert Christian, were taken through the workings of the West End mine yesterday and shown the big bodies of ore being mined. This Is Mr. Haley's first visit to one of the Tonopah mines and he ex pressed himself as being greatly astonished at the bodies of ore dis closed. In the drift on the first level the ore is rapidly becoming oxidized In character and the values are In creasing. When this body of ore was first encountered the values averaged about $10 a ton, but now It will re turn $50 a ton. At the point now reached they are running along with the ledge and have not as yet en countered the foot or 'hanging wall. The ledge has been opened up for a distance of 127 feet and of this the last thirty feet is of a good milling grudgingly. But as he arose from his knees when the ordeal was ended, he brushed the knees of his trousers, and remarked in not inaudible tones: "This halways was a dirty 'ouse, hannyway." And so, in dusting our trousers after printing the above letter, we might mention a little dream we once had not once, but many times (and was it a dream?) of certain merchants who have been driven out of business in the east, In the middle and in the far west, because they persisted in selling oil which was not supplied by the greatest of all our charitable institutions, the Standard Oil company; of merchants who were sent polite little notices of what might happen if they persisted in selling oil in a community, even when that oil was supplied by the charitable institution above men tioned, at less price than other merchants in that community were selling the same oil. Mr. Miller is in grave danger of being accused of not making proper use of his time if It comes to Mr. Archbold's attention that he took a few minutes to write to a little country newspaper In Nevada that "the Standard Oil company does not make any effort to control, nor can it control, the selling prices at which merchants sell their goods to the consumers." What was the use of writing that? Does not every one know it? Mr. Miller's sense of humor Is most subtle and no doubt will be appreciated by our readers. DESERVES MUCH COMMENDATION. The action of the officials of the Tonopah and Goldfield railway In announcing a very material cut in freight rates, to take effect Jan uary 2, 1909, deserves the commendation of all the residents or southern Nevada. The cut rate, coming at a time when "duirtimes" is the cry, and when the great transcontinental roads are announc ing a practical 10 per cent advance, Is unexpected, and at the same time shows that the railroad is willing to do Its share toward the upbuilding of the greater Nevada. Wllber F. Blair, business mana ger of the Hall-Luhrs company of Sacramento, arrived yesterday from the coast. Mrs. C. J. Sadler, of Reno, passed through this city yesterday en route to Goldfield, where she will make a brief visit.

In the intermediate drift they have two machines working taking out the shipping ore. The ledge here still retains its richness and is about four feet In width. On the bottom level they ars stop lng in the No. 3 raise, where they have cut Into a big ledge which ap pears to be getting richer as they proceed. A drift has been started at a point twenty-five feet east of the shaft that will cut the big ledge after traversing fifty feet and then stoplng will be commenced. The mine has never looked better during Its history and at the present time has a number of huge ore bodies blocked out for future work. The company is also doing a little de velopment work. It is expected that they will soon sink another hundred feet and from that level drift until the big ledge, is encountered and then work up to the 400-foot level.
