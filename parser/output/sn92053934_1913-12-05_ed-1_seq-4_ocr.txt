The paper Shows much hard work and pains and is altogether creditable. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and West Virginia ar credited with over in nor rent nf the 1n1u mineral tirn- duction of the United States. Penn-lalmo pylvania outranks all other states, pro ducing nearly 25 per cent of the total. West Virginia comes second. Illinois third, and Oh!o fourth. Ca r of pig I with no standing as a producer of pig iron, iron ore or coal, stands fifth In rank among the states, owing to its heavy production of gold and petro leum. The free wool clause f the new tariff biil went into effect Dec. 1. and instead of prophecies of disaster from the wool Interests we find the Ameri can Wool and Cotton Reporter, an au thority in such matters, declaring that "the tariff change which would apply most severely to the textile industry, seem to have scarcely any influence." What has Smoof, "greatest shepherfi since Abraham, to say to this? And Penrose, who pictured the soup houses in textile mill towns to be filled with starving workingmen when protection should Le removed from wool? 

WOF.RR TUB MOVCT GOES. Dispatches from Washington show that the estimates call for more than a billion dollars to run the federal government for the fiscal year that begins the first of next July. This is In keeping with estimates in years that have passed and hence there is no sur prise in the big total mentioned. It will be well If the public can be got to take some interest in the dif ferent items of the estimates. In this way it can come to have some notion of where the money goes. For in-1 atance, the military establishment j wanta almost $106,000,000; the navy wants $140,000,000; and pensions call! for 1169 00(1 ftao There li a little H 15,000,000 for wars past and pos- slbly prospective, which is both un avoidable and wis The estimate calls for about $307.-1 000,000 for the postofflce department. The postofEce will practically earn its way; that !s a business undertak ing, something that pays Its war and gives good service for the tariffs charged. Leaving the postoffice out of the reckoning, it takes about $800,000,000 a year to ran the federal goverBneBt. And over half of that enormous sum goes for wars of one kind and an other and yet there are people who do not sustain President Wilson's aversion to war. a l TO 

HECKLES! X ESS. Rock Island had an example the other night of auto recklessness, when a citizen was run down at Third ave nue and Twentieth street by a speed ing machine, the driver of which did not stop to take the paina to investi gate. Through the vigilance of the police the miscreant was finally ap prehended and fined by Magistrate Smith. It is such depredations as this man was guilty of that create the demand for more drastic automobile regula j tions. While there has been some lm I prorement in regard to traffic require- ments in Rock Island the past six months, instances of disregard both for the ordinances and public safety are still noticeable, and will not dis appear entirely until there are more arrests and fines and Rock Island fol lows more closely to the example of Moline and Davenport as to traffic con trol. THE INSPIRATION OF PROGRESS. As suffering opens the heart and brings new conception of sympathy and charity, so the infliction of great i wrong serves to dedicate men to the j deduction of that wrong, illustrating that evil carries with It its-own anti I dote.

CLYDE Congressman fram f"peelal Correspondence of The Argus.) . Washington. Dec 3. Erer since I was sworn in aa a member of congress I have been carrying on a campaign to induce the gov- eminent to In crease the plant at the Rock Island ar senal. The arsenal ought to be twice the size It is. and it should be giving steady employ ment to twice the number of men that it is. and re gardless of the outcome of my present efforts these things are coming to pass and that within a very few years. I am speaking now not from the 

CLYDE H, viewpoint of what TAVtNNER the cities clustered about the arsenal would naturally like to see come about, but from the view point of simply such ordinary and rea sonable economy in the expenditure of public funds that the people have a right to expect. That is, if the Rock Island arsenal was twice its present sire, giving em ployment to double the men It is now employing, hundreds and thousands of dollars would be saved to the tax payers of the United States. Rock Island arsenal is going to hum some day, not because of the efforts of any single member of congress, but because the Rock Island arsenal is endowed with advantages superior to those of any other arsenal In the United States. Army and navy appropriations hare doubled in the last 13 years, and I re gret to say I fear they are going to go on Increasing, and in a very, very few years the government is going to do all of its own manufacturing, and when that time comes you may get ready to see Rock Island arsenal made the largest plant of its kind in the world. Even under present conditions Rock Island arsenal should be a great deal larger than it Is. and giving work to many more employes but it Is being deprived of work Justly due it by a ring of private manufacturers who are charging the gpvernment one-third more for all kinds of ordnance sup plies than they could be manufactured for at Rock Island, and which ring in war time holds up the government by refusing to fnanufacture articles of military necessity unless the govern ment pays increased prices. (See an nual report of secretary of navy. Just issued, which I will glady send to any one requesting it. This ammunition ring. I desire to testify in passing, has powerful and resourceful friends in both war de partment and congress. It is worthy of observation, too. that the same offi cials who are standing out for the am munition ring, are also insisting that the Taylor Bystem of scientific shop management be installed in the gov ernment arsenal, this in spite of the fact a committee of the democratic house investigated .he Taylor system in the last congress and unanimously reported that it placed the working men in the position of beasts of bur den. If the big eastern manufacturers can induce the government to install the Taylor system, they will be able to say to labor organisations protest ing against stop watches and scientific speeding up processes that the system must be alright because it has been O. K.'d by the United States govern ment. But it was not my purpose to discuss this phase of the subject in this statement. "The Yountf Lady

Comment H. TAVENNEB ths Fourteenth District. As above stated. I have been work ing as best I could to pry, some of the artillery ammunition contracts loose from the private contractor, and w hile reports of these efforts have ap peared in the newspapers. aUll the awerage citizen of th tri-citiea ia no doubt not fully informed aa to what I am doing, how I am going about it and what I expect to accomplish In the end. Therefore 1 feel 1 should stop a moment and report, as briefly as possible, the exact status of the sit uation at this time. The government now has on hand only 23 per cant of the quantity of field artillery ammunition which is considered by the war department necessary as a reserre. Therefore the program of the de partment calls for $20,000,000 worth of field artillery ammunition. $6,000,000 worth the coming year and the re maining $14,000,000 worth aa fast aa congress will make the necessary ap propriations. As a result of the foresight of the friends of the ammunition ring in congress and in the w-ar department, the arsenals combined have a capacity for manufacturing only $1,500,000 worth of this ammunition, or even less than that. This means that the work which can not be handled in the gov ernment arsenals will go to the am munition ring. The only remedy for this situation is to induce congress to enlarge the capacity of the arsenals so that it can do a larger amount of all of its man ufacturing. This Is what I am en-, deavorng to do. My hope is to bring the artillery ammunition contracts to Rock Island. It would mean the saving of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to- the government, and it would also mean employment for a great many ad ditional men. This proposition is. I therefore, of the greatest importance not only to the quad-cities, but to the small towns near by as well. -On 5 of the first questions which naturally arises is: What arguments can be. advanced to justify the gov ernment in sending the work to Rock Island? The best arguments are that we have free water power at Rock Island, and a $400,000 building erected for manufacturing purposes, but which is now being used only as a store house. This structure would make an ideal home for an ammunition plant. Two hundred and fifty, thousand, dollars, it is estimated, would, equip the building for the manufacture of artillery am munition, and this sum could be 6aved the first four months the plant was in operation. An additional $200,000 store house and a $15,000 magazine In which to Jbouse the projectiles when finished, would also be required, although not absolutely necesary to start with. Representatives Donohue and Ed munds of Philadelphia are carrying on an enthusiastic campaign to obtain emmunition contracts for Frankford arsenal, located at Philadelphia. Rock Island has several advantages over Philadelphia. Every available square foot of the Frankford arsenal is now utilized. The government would be required to buy additional land and erect expensive buildings to increase the capacity of Frankford ar senal. And Frankford does not have the advantage of free water power, but must develop its power with the use of coal.

This action has been taken because of the inter ruption of traffic due to a strike which has developed with amazing sudden- Iness. it originated inrougu me ais mlssal of an engine driver.

KAUFMAN FAMILY BY ELMA R. TWINING. : Copyrighted. i9lj. by Associated Literary Kurt au. "And. now," said August Kaurman. after receiving payment for his busi ness which be- bad just sold for what was to htm a fortune "the- next thins I will do la to bur nay ticket for home. It will require two weeks for me to set there and another two weeks to And my wife and child. If I hava good Juck we shall spend Christmas to gether.'. lie spoke tha words "if I have good , luck," doubtfully and with a tremor in bis voice. Not for years aaa ne neara of bis wife and child. He did not know that he should find them at all. Would he find ekher of them alive? And in what condition would he find them, if at all? Kaufman was an example of what both adversity and prosperity will do for one. Years before In the city of An halt, Germany, be had met and married Gretchen Reinicke. The bride was given a substantial dowry by her father, and the couple started In life with every prospect of happi ness. When a little boy was born to them their affairs were fn excellent condition, and there was not a cloud In their domestic horizon. But Kaufman insisted on using bis young wife's dowry in business, and when his little son Carl was a year old the father had lost every pfenning of his capital. Too sensitive to re main where he was to bear the re proaches of his wife's relatives, be told , her that he was going to America, where, so he understood, making a living, if not a fortune, was easy, and when settled there be would send for her and their child. , But Kaufman did not find America a country so easy to get on in as he had expected. His nature was rather "I AM TOUR FATHER." to mnke short cuts than to plod. He had not learned a trade; therefore he could not work by the day, and, hav ing no capital, he was unable to go into business for himself. During the first year of his absence from home he wrote to his wife regularly, but, having no prospect of being able to send for her and little Carl, his letters after that became less frequent. Gradually from year to year August Kaufman's connection with his family dwindled. Indeed, what was there to hold them together, they being 3,000 or 4,0JO miles apart and in countries where the people were entirely differ ent? It would be impossible to look into Kaufman's heart during this sep aration from his family and see Just what yearnings were there. We know that after a time he stopped writing and receiving letters, but may not his wife as well as be at last have tired of a communication whlcn was con fined to pen and paper? About ten years after Kaufman coming to America, having made jna experiments and drifted to many corn tries, he succeeded in borrowing a it tie money to go into business, a rt of the profits to go to the lender, fie soon repaid the loan and in a few wars more sold out his business for esaugh to enable him to live the rest ft his life in ease. And now the original Kanfyan re turns to us, and we find him h eager to Join his family as he had lien dur ing those first lonely days thg he had spent In the new country. ItA difficult to look upon him as the sae person. Jt. is fifteen years since -haleft them. His affection for them hafeither died or lain dormant. That it had lain dormant is erident from the fact of the atrfng desire to rejoin them that had siidenly flamed within him. It seemedthat he could scarcely wait for the stmer on which he was to sail to lea- Then when crossing the ocean h counted every day till be should rch the land and start by train for by old borne. Once nis mina. aivestea, us BiwiruuiM j in business, became fixed on his wife; and boy, be beg& to dread that he ; would find one J both dead or that , they had drifted way and ne "'d not be able to yfearn where they had gone. When be reaped Anhalt ?nd went to bis old home found strangers there. His wife had owned it, but had sold It, doubtless lo obtain means to live. Ilis wife's parents were dead. He found a cof-ln of hers who told him that GretcJf-n and her son Carl had grown ve; poor and had gone to Ber lin, but tf ir address in Berlin the In formant id not know. But Kaufman found otJers who bad known his wife and at ht got the address, but since she hadsone away three years before be haittle hope of finding ber. Er 1 rore leavlng for ISeiSIn he bought back his wife's former haie. puying an ex tra price for immedcite possesion. His reason for this was that he had a faint hope that be would find bis family and that they mijcht spend Christmas In their old home. Consid ering that he did not know that they were alive, this contingency was very remote, but somehow) the tuisband and father had a feeling that Providenc would be kind tojilru. At the address in Berlin Kaufman did not find his family. They had left the place two years ago. The only comfort to be deijved from this In formation was thattthey'had boh been aIivetwo years before. After inquiry of a number of persons who hml known' the mother and son in Berlin Kaufman traced thm to Iiuig. lie tried to learn .how they had made a living, but failed. The only informa tion he received.-other than where they had gone was that his son played the riolin. Kaufman wentto IVIpzig. where hn found a house in which, his wife and boy had lodged. They had left Leip zig, but no one could tell him wber they had gone. However, he gained here a-bit of vtaluahle-lnformatJon. He learned that his boyj, now sixteen years old, had earned a living while In Leipzig for Mmself and his mother by playing thcvlolln inan orchontra. The father now had lixtle hope of succeeding in his. search before Christ mas, since but four days remained to hlrn. Surely, not fcnowing-where on the globe his lowed ones were, how could be expect to find them in so short a time? Nevertheless the-feeling that a kind Providence would' help him dil not desert blm. He at once took holdi of the only clew he had that his son was a musi cian. From Berlin Mrs. Kaufman and Carl, having gone southward, were on the line to Munich, which was a great place fir music. Would not n musi cian be more likely on leaving Leip zig to go to Munich than anywhere else? Kaufman Immediately started for the capital of Bavaria. On the night of his arrival he re paired to the celebrated 'Hofbrau whero a great deal of beer i consumed and a great deal of musle is discoursed. He took a seat close to the orchestra and studied the-faces of the younger players. There was but one young enough to be his Car and after study ing the boy'a fac for awhile ho thought he could trice a resemblance to himself. As soon' as the piece being played was finished he went to the boy and asked him his fin me. "Kaufman," was, the response. "Carl?" ' "Yes. Carl." One more question the father asked before declaring llmself. "Is your moth er living?" and, qh receiving an affirma tive answer, so lif: "I am your faher." Carl could ift leave the orchestra until the evening's program was finish ed, but he gavfc his father his mother's address, and fhe latter hurried away. Of the meelng between the long sep arated couplA there Is no record, but when Carl Kaufman returned to his lodgings hefound his father and moth er togetherwnd was informed that they were all trce to return to Anhnlt in the mornig to spend Christmas in their old liomo. So Carl resigned his position p the orchestra, and the fam ily left junlch. Mrs. Kaufman- had sold her house with tip furniture, and when her hus bond rpnrchased it he bought back nil that lpd been sold. When the family reachyd it they had only to walk in and nd everything as they had left it. They returned to it the day !e foraChristmos in time to make prep araflons for the Christmas dinner the neft day. seemed to these people that they wf re in a aream. row and aealn some qpo v jt'an ong- i ft a t e of them would stop and wonder: this be true? Are we after so a separation reunited? Are our days of poverty ended? Is this earth or heaven descended to earth?". On Christmas morning Mrs. Kauf man found on her plate not only a deed to her house, but a check for the rest of her dowry that her husband had sunk in business with interest. As . for Carl, who was devoted to music, he found on bis plate a check for a sum that would enable him to buy the best violin that could be found in Germany. The day was passed by Kaufman re counting his adventures in America and by the mother and son telling him the expedients to which they bad r sorted to keep from starving. It had only been during the past year or two that Carl by bis music had been ena bled to keep them in any comfort. The Kaufman family lived together for many years in the home to which they had gone the day after, the wed ding and bad returned on Christmas. The father seemed perfectly content to moke bis pipe there, bavlag no desire to return to the land where be had endured so mncb, but had, at last madi his fortune. As for Carl, he became a noted violinist and has made several concert tours in America.
