Washington, D. C, Dec 5. The president today sent the following re commendations to the Fifty-ninth con gress: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The people of this country continue tr. enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt edly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community, both by the deserv ing and the undeserving. Against the wrath of the Lord the wisdom of man can not avail; in times of flood or drought human ingenuity can but par tially repair the disaster. A general a failure of crops would hurt us. Again, if all the folly of. man mars the general well-being, then those who are innocent of (be folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are puiity of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business communi ty would hurt the whole business com munity. But such stoppage of wel fare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent f S322B33E

In our industrial and social system the interests of all men are fo closely intertwined that in the immense ma jority of cases a straight-dealing man who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity and industry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man of great productive capacity who be comes rich by guiding the labor of many other men does so by enabling them to produce more than they could produce without his . guidance; and both he and they share in the benefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial fact that "the sharing may be equal must never blind us to the underlying: fact that there is this sharing, and thatrihe Benefit comes in some degree to each man concerned.

Tet, while not merely admitting, but insisting1 upon this, it is also true that where there is no governmental re straint or supervision some of the ex ceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for the common good, but in ways which tell against thi3 common good. The fortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to piake it a matter, of .necessity to give to the sovereign that is, to the. government, which represents' the people as a" whole some effective power" of-supervision oTPr" tffeTfCBrporate Txs erHTn "order '"to insure a healthy sod ail and industrial life, every big corporation should bo held responsible by, and be accounta ble to, some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct.. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. Thi3 is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only useless, but in the end vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce inevitably . pro duces. We should, moreover, recog nize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good , effected by corporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the 'wealth of intellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and therefore normally to the service of the public, by their officers and directors. The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be- fa vored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and Justice. So long as the finances of the nation are kept upon an honest basis no oth er question of internal economy with which the congress has the power to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under whicli the individuals and especially the great corporations doing an in terstate business are to act. The makers of our national Constitution provided especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the general gov ernment. The arguments in favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But- they are far stronger today, in view of the enor mous development of great business agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state ac tion. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised. by a sovereign whose Jurisdiction is coex tensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by the national government. I believe that this regu lation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the con gress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such pover upon the national government by a proper amendment of the Constitution. It would obviously be unwise to en deavor to secure such ' an amendment until it is certain that the result can not be obtained under the Constitu tion as it now is. The laws of the congress and of the several " states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in showing that the states have no power In the matter than that the national govern ment has power; so that there at pres ent exists a very unfortunate condi tion of things, under which these great corporations doing an interstate busi ness occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national govern ment having effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action.

Baker of the cruiser Raleigh, who has been detached for several months to study commercial and political con ditions in China, was a passenger on the aianchuria, arriving home from the Orient, on his way to Washington to lay before the president and his' ad visers the results of his investiga tions. , "It i3 nonsense," said Captain Bak er, "to talk of the boycott as dying out. The commercial situation in the south Of China is absolutely at the mercy of the guilds. There are seventy-one of these. They contral trade with an iron hand, and they have giv en orders not to handle American goods. It is almost impossible to get at them. Of course,' we have treaties g-uaranteeing the free circulation of our goods, but supposing the coolies on the docks, the carriers on the streets and everybody connected with the handling of goods refuse to touch them, what are you to do? American ware houses . in Canton are full to the roof with flour, and they can't budge it. In the meantime Australian merchants ate chartering everything they can get their hands on to rush their " inferior flour into the market to take advan tage of our difficulty. "Not only the Australian, but the Japanese are taking advantage of the boycott to get our business. Cotton mills are being established in China by Japanese houses and with cheap labor and with no transportation charges they are In a position to drive us out of the field. They will also . develop the steel ore in Korea, and probably oil. In this way the vast kerosene and steel business there will be taken over by the Japanese. "The only thing that could raise the boycott would be to rescind the Chi nese exclusion laws and this, of course, will not be done. It looks as though ouir business in the south of China were doomed. The boycott is ; getting worse every day there.'.

HOUSE. The Emergency Panama Canal Bill to Come Up Today, Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's message - to congress re ceived the attention of the house for two and a half hours today. Its read ing was listened to with marked at tention, and at its conclusion the doc ument was applauded. Preliminary steps were taken toward appropriat ing the needed emergency funds for the Panama canal. This will be consid ered tomorrow. Should unanimous con sent be refused for its consideration, a special rule from the committee on rules will be available, which will put the bill on its passage after a limited period of discussion. The house received and ordered re ferred to one of the regular election committees a protest from the fifth congressional district of . Illinois, stat ing that Anthony Michalek, who was yesterday sworn hv as a member of th house from that district, is not a citizen of the United States. The pro test was. presented by Mr.- Rainey, of that state, who asked for consideration of the matter-by a special committee. This point was the only one contested, it being sujrcrested by Mr.; Mann that it was a matter for the elections com mittee to consider, and his amendment to this effect was adopted on. a yea-and-nay vote. On motion of Mr. Goldfogle,' of New York, a resolution was read expressing the sympathy of the American people with the distressed Russian Jews. The resolution was ordered printed in the Record and referred to the committee on foreign affairs. THE

The market for wheat was strong- almost the entire day. One of the main bullish factors was a cablegram from Russia, stating that wheat shipments from that coun try were small and that the strike was a serious menace to business. - The demand became general late in the day and closing prices were practical ly at the highest point. The strength of cash wheat at all American mar kets was another potent influence. May openen unchanged to a shade lower at 88 1-8 to 88 1-4, advanced to 83 and closed at S8 7-8 to 89, a gain of 1-8.
