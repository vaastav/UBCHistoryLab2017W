A lot of array pets put in their time in Washington leading the gertnan nnl other sociil functions, and when called on for service, they don't knov straight up.

I called out a company and told him to see what was needed. The first thing he did was to shout, "Carry, arms!" to the boys. Not a soldier moved. "Carry, arms!" he yelled again, but there was no response. After the third order the lieutenant turned to the sergeant and asked what the trouble was. 'We have been taught that the order to carry arms has been dropped,' replied the ser geant. 'That's so,' said the officer. I had forgotten it.1 He dismissed the company and then we went out and took something. He was a nice fellow and bad the society business down tine, but he didn't know any thing abgut running an army.

Abilene Hits Spent $213,500 in Years. 18 How mush mon-'y do you suppose 'this school district l.a-s spent since ! 1885 for school purposes? Could you make an intelligent guess? Treasurer C. A. H-jdge was inter ested in the matler and today com puted tho total atnouut be has drawn as treasurer of district No. 6 iu that time. It is $213,600. This includes Mitchell feats Us. Dickinson has a fine courthouse but it has to take a back seat for Mitchell county. The Minneapolis Messenger says of the now court house at Belolt: "The new building, so long needed, will apparently en dure as long as Kansas does, being made of native stone, trimmed with Warrensburg sandstone, with a foundation of Cottonwood Falls stone. The outside dimensions of the struc ture are 78 feet 8 inches by 95 feet and erected, at a total oost of $138, 310." Dickinson's courthouse when the addition is completed will have cost less than $35,000, of which Abi lene city gave $20,000. Convalescence after pneumonia, ty phoid fever and the grip, is some times merely apparent, not real. To make it real and rapid, there is no other tonic so highly to be recom mended as Hood's Sarsaparilla. Thousands so testify. Take Hood's. A Pleasant Surprise, About 15 friends and neighbors of Mrs. Hanna called on her Friday the occasion being her 83d birthday an niversary and took dinner with her, leaving some pleasant remembrances. Her son, E. J. Warner, of Idaho, sent her $25 as a gilt. Dr. Wood's tlorway Pine Syrup seems especially adapted to the needs of the children. Pleasant to take.

R. Burton: Senator Burton, ot Kansas, has shaved off bis black mustache. With smooth face and coal black hair, plastered down upon his forehead, he looks like an actor who is weighed down with gloomy thoughts. No tragedy would be too deep for him, no situation too intense to be beyond his reach. Perhaps ho was an actor once. Who knows? The Congressional Directory is silent on th subject, Burton's biography only occupies three lines in that compendium of personal in formation. And these thiee lines ouly state his name, the fact that he was elected to the senate to succeed Lucien Bakor, and that his term of service will expire March 3, 1907. So that, if in the past he trod the boards in guise of Richard III or Othello or Hamlet, there is nothing to prove it, His actor like features and his stately walk are only evidences of circum stantial character, and may, perhaps, mislead. SHE IS MOT VENGEFUL- Mrs. Scurlock Wants the Father to See His Children. Manhattan Nationalist: Three years ago Mrs. Allie Scurlock of Abi lene, then of Warsaw, Mo., was de serted by her husband. Scurlock was 42 and eloped with a girl of 16 who is believed to be his wife's daughter but his own stepdaughter. Mrs. Scurlock after three years fruitless search learned that they had been here re cently and came Saturday in quest of them. After a fruitless search she left but Marshal Quinn has succeeded since In locating them in the south west part of town where they live In poverty, Mr. Scurlock being an in valid and unable to work, The woman being young and strong has done housework and washing where- ever she could rind it. They came here as they said from Topeka about a month ago and informed the neigh bors that they were father and daugh ter. The deserted wife has not re turned yet.- She says she will not prosecute but desires to have her bus band go home and see the children before he dies. Chapman Won Out The Chapman second eleveu defeated Abilene'a high school football team last Thursday 12 to 0. Chapman ran in 5 of the first elevon man and of course uould win.

There should be railings at these openings. The Chriitmai Dinner, In spite ot the fact that the word dyspepsia means literally bad cook, it will not be fair for many to lay the blame on the cook if tbey begin the Christmas dinner with little appetite and end it with distress or nausea. It may not be fair for any to do that let us hope ro for the sake of the cook! The disease dyspepsia indicates a bad stomich, that is a weak stomach, rather than a bad cook, and tor a weak stomach there is nothing else equal to Hood's Sarsaparilla. It gives the stomach vigor and tone, cures dyspepsia, creates appetite, and makes eating tho pleasure It should be. flew CardTypes.

Sauer resigned last week. He has had under consid eration a better position for some time and has decided to give up c cial life therefor. He has made an excellent officer and has given Abi Iene the best ot order and a thorough administration of his duties. Mayor Halleck will reappoint J. B. Favor as marshal. Mr. Favor resigned the place a year ago to become mail carrier under the free delivry ser vice but finds the work too severe (or his health. He is under necessity ot giving up his position and will accept his old place. There is no better marshal on earth than John Favor and AMlene will welcome him to bis former office. Emory Howlaud, whose fine service as assistant marshal has won him much commendation, will remain in that place, insuring good watch fulness at night. FEEDING WHEAT PAID. Alex, Mustard of Talmage Fed 74 Hogs Profitably. Tauuaue, Dec. 5. Alexander Mus tard has just marketed 74 hogs that were fattened ou wheat profitably. This load ot hogs was put on a diet ot wheat and alfalfa on August 14. The 74 head at the time they were first put upon the scales weighed 10,273 pounds. At the conclusion of the ex periment the total weight at home the other day was 22,480 pounds, Bhowing a gain of 12,207 pounds, an average daily gain ol a fraction less than two pounds perjhead. At the price al which the hogs sold, this would be an average gain ot 12 cents per day, At no time during the experiment did the swine''receive as much wheat as they would eat. During portions of the test, Mr. Mustaid estimates that he gained as high as 17 pounds to the bushel, figuring that one pound of wheat cost one cent. The animals were weighed for the first time on August 22, at.er having been on feed since the 14th. On seven subsequent dates thoy were again weighed. Mr. Mustard says the financial gain in this experiment was greater than he ever realized when he used corn The excellence of the meat produced by the use ol wheat is illustrated in the fact that his bogs brought a pre mium of 10 cents over anything else on the market. Mr. Mustard has been a resident ot Kansas for 26 years and during 23 years of that perio has resided on the (arm whereon this test ass made. Burton Dined With President. Washington, D, C, Dec, 7.
