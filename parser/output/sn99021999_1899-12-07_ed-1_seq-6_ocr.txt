' IXSl'LAlt ro.MMKMlAL RELATIONS Thc ( I'ltcfttlon of' commercial relations between the Tnltrd States and Its In sular possessions Porto Klco and the Philippines Is one of the most Impor tant that congress will have to deter mine. It concerns large American In terests Hint will insist upon receiving consideration anil there is involved In It tlie future welfare of these Islands. Trade relations with Cuba are also a matter of ino.st vital interest to the people of that Island as well as to important Industries In this country. President MeKlnloy favors free trade with Porto Ulco. ilo points out that since the cession of that Island It has been denied the markets It formerly enjoyed In Spain and In Cuba and that there have been no compensating bene fits In the American market. Consequently the trade of Porto Hlco has very largely declined and doubtless under existing conditions will continue to decline. The president says In his < message : "The markets of the United States should bp opened up to her ' products , our plain duty Is to abolish ' all customs tariffs between the United \ States and Porto I Moo and give her products free access to our markets.1 ' As to Cuba the president says that "so long as we exercise control over the Island the products of Cuba should have a market In the United States on as good terms aid ) with as favorable rates of duty as arc given to the West India Islands under treaties of reciprocity which shall be made , " Nothing Is said In the message In regard to commercial relations with the Philippines and pr-ib- ! ably there will be no material change from present conditions In respect to those Islands. The government has agreed to observe there the "open door'1 iwlicy , under which this country will have no advantage in trade over other countries. It would therefore seem safe to assume that Philippine products will be given no special favor Jii this mar ket , at least until American capital shall become largely Invested there in pro duction , a possibility perhaps somewhat remote. American sugar , tobacco , rice and fruit , producers are especially Interested in this question of Insular commercial relations and their position respecting it is shown in the resolutions of the American Beet Sugar association at its meeting In this city Tuesday. These declare that the present tariff duties are essential not only to the Increase of the beet sugar Industry , but to Its very existence , since It cannot compete with a product raised by coolie and de based labor if that product is admitted free or even at a low rate of duty to the American market. Tills applies equally to other articles raised in Cuba , Porto Ulco and the Philippines which are also produced In this country. It is expected that within a few years tlie production of sugar in Cuba will reach its former proportions and it will cer tainly do so if favored by an American tariff. The tobacco Industry there would under such circumstances also be greatly increased. Free trade for Porto Kho would stimulate the productions of that island. Some , competition from the Philippines with American products is to be looked for in any event , but it will not be serious so long as existing con ditions are maintained. The problem presented Is perplexing. If a policy le ) adopted having In view the industrial and commercial develop ment of. the islands for whose future welfare we have assumed responsibility there Is the danger of seriously Injur ing if not destroying important home in dustries. If we continue to protect these industries decadence rather than recovery may be'the experience of the Islands that have come into our care , perhaps resulting in more or less seri ous trouble for us. Unquestionably the lirst duty of the government Is to safe guard the Interests and promote the welfare of Its own people. We cannot afford to sacrifice valuable American in terests in behalf of people who perhaps will never contribute anything to na tional wealth and power , even if they should not prove to be a burden. Con gress will find this question of Insular commercial relations one of the most dlllicult problems It will be called upon to deal with. 

TIMK TU CALL A HALT. The taxpayers of Omaha have pa tiently submitted to the rank Jobbery and downright robbery perpetrated upon them through the conscienceless combine - bine that controls our public schools until patience has ceased to be a virtue. The defeat of the braxen hold-ups for reiiomlnation has emboldened these grafters In the last hours of their term to put through several transparent Jobs that are utterly indefensible. One of these jobs is the proposed re newal of the contract for cleaning of seats and desks In the various schools. Tills work was formerly done by day labor under personal supervision of tlie superintendent of buildings , but for two or three years It has become a soft snap for one or two contractors who mani festly are compelled to divvy with boodle members who engineered the Job. Wo are informed that during the last year the contractor for seat cleaning lias drawn over $ ( JXH ( ) out of the school treasury. This work could -have been done for half that sum , but that does not seem to concern the combine , which calls special sessions every oilier day to carry through the deals that have been slated for the season. Onu of the most inexcusable ! grafts was put through under whip and spur Monday night In the election of George II. Hess as truant olllccr at a salary of ifl.iiOO a year. This position was cre ated under an net of tlie hist legisla ture , which .Member lies * log-rolled through while lie was on the pay roll of the state as Jfl-ii-tlay clerk of the leg islative comm'ltteo of which that gallant patriot , Hugh Myers , was chairman , l-'or this reason Mr , UCBS claims priority of selection ami the board has voted him tlie sinecure In defiance , of the law ' ' which prohlbt's'lls | awn members from being Interested lu niiy contract with tlio board. But -If Mr. IJcss was the only man In Omaha ( nullified to fill this new otllcc what excuse is there for pay- [ Ing him SI.aw for si > rvlre covering illy ! nllie mouths ailil which he could per- I form without seriously disturbing his private business ? We make bold to as sert that there are IfKi men In tbjs com munity Just as capable "as Hess Avho would gladly perform the duties of tru ant otllcer for ? 0 < l n month , counting only actual time employed. The same undue haste that has char acterized the election of Hess Is being displayed lu regard to the proposed eon- tract for the olllclal architect. There Is no need of an olllclal architect any more than there Is of a school board attorney , j whose place was created some years ago for a political mixer. So long as the board pursues the policy of Inviting competition for architectural plans for new school buildings it can got along comfortably without an otllclal archi tect. All It needs Is n llrst-ehiss super intendent of buildings who can be trusted with the superintendence , re construction and maintenance of school buildings without the aid and consent of an architect. If the present superin tendent Is not competent or trustworthy It is the duty of the board to dispense with his services and hire a belter man. In any event the attempts to rush through jobs , contracts and sinecure ap pointments during the closing days of the present board should be thwarted In the Interest of the taxpayers as well as the school svstem. I'llOTKCTlDS til' President Mclvinley recommends legislation conferring upon the federal ' courts jurisdiction in cases of violence ( against the citizens of foreign countries ; in the United States where the ultimate ! responsibility of the federal government may be involved. He refers to tlie lynching - ' . ing some months ago In Louisiana of j Italian subjects , which It appears is still being investigated by the Department of'Slate , with a view to determining the citizenship of the victims ami says that the "recurrence of these distressing manifestations of blind mob fury ] directed at dependents or natives of a foreigncountry suggests that the con tingency has arisen for action by con gress in the direction of conferring upon i the federal courts jurisdiction In this class of International cases. " Attention is called to the views of President Harrison in his annual mos- j sage of 1S01 , prompted by the lynching of Italians in New Orleans , which j brought about a rather serious mis understanding between Italy and the United States. The demand of the j Italian government at that time for Indemnity - demnity , there being no question that | the men killed by the mob were Italian subjects , was met by the statement that the federal government was not re sponsible and that the Italian govern ment must look to the state of Louisiana for the punishment of those guilty of the murder and forreparation. * Thereupon the minister of that govern ment at Washington was recalled nnd for a time the friendly relations be tween the countries was impaired , but an understanding was effected by which our government paid an Indemnity. In the later case the'ro is a a question whether all five of the Italians lynched were subjects of Italy and when this Is determined our government will doubtless do what It shall deem to be fair and just in the matter , so far as indemnity is concerned. This Is all , however , that the federal government can do. It is powerless to punish those who committed the crime. While promising in its treaty with Italy the same protection and security to tlie citizens of that country as arc given to its own citizens , it has no power to punish murderers of Italian subjects , so that really the lives of citizens of for eign countries domiciled here get no se curity whatever from the federal gov ernment. There ought to bo no ques tion as to the expediency of the legisla tion recommended by President McKinley - ley , in support of which he presents some very cogent reasons. A Missouri court has held that the promise of a doputyship by a candidate for office Is a bribe tendered to a voter in violation of the corrupt practices act. To be a bribe the thing offered must be something of value. Promises of deputy- ' ships may be worth something in Mis souri , but there are scores of popocratlc politicians In Omaha who would be willing to swear that promises are not worth a cent In this climate. The monthly reports of the comptroller showing the cash on hand and deposited in banks to the credit of tlie city treas urer would be much more valuable If they also Included the statements of the warrants outstanding. The treasury ex hibit looks well with a neat balance to Its credit , but It would not look so well If itwas , set off against the floating In debtedness drawn against funds pre maturely exhausted. There Is no good reason why Nebraska should not become one of the greatest beet sugar producing states in thu coun try nor why Omaha should not be the center. of the sugar Industry In this sec tion. _ By keeping everlastingly at it this much-to-be-deslred result will bo accom plished. _ l-'orliini' Karorit K 1mm , Washington Star.

Our new Department of Agriculture , which , when first authorized by congress , was regarded by many as likely to prove moro costly nnd ornamental than useful or profitable. Is gradually Justifying Ha cre ation. While the experiments In agriculture carried on under Its supervision may not have been of great practical value to the average American farmer , the Information It collects and furnishes to the public In Its monthly bulletins nnd annual reports Is worth many times the coat of collection nnd publication. H Is well known that wo raise cotton , wheat , corn , oats , various fruits nnd moat products to supply the deficiencies of the rest of the world , but It Is not so well known that wo Import $200,000,000 $ worth annually of the agricultural and forest products of othci ; countries. The annual report of the Department of Agriculture for the present year presents this fact In clear and unmis takable figures , and the mere statement In dicates that there Is still n vast profitable nnd unoccupied field waiting for the Ameri can farmer. The hulk of these Imported products , which Include coffee , sugar. India rubber and a dozen varieties of fruit are chiefly grown In tropical countries. With our recent acquisitions In thr West Indies Philippines and the Sandwich Islands wo are prepared to engage In the production ol nil these articles and the $200,000,000 prize Is certainly worth striving for. As a prerequisite to success In this line the American people should cultivate a lit- these reports too carefully for their own tie more pride and faith in American prod ucts. We are Importing and using very In ferior American wine , which Is exported first to bo furnished -with a foreign label , when we could get a much better article at home If we were willing to be known as consumers of home-made wines. There Is little doubt that wo can produce figs , dates , prunes and other fruits which we now largely Import. Oranges of the best we al ready grow In Florida and California , and with our new West India acquisitions all our tropical fruits can easily be of the home grown varieties. And why should we not be able to supply our own wnnta in the shape of coffee and tea. nnd the sugar to sweeten both within a very few years ? The fault of the American farmer to date has been his inclination to confine himself to the cultivation of a few staple crops , with which he often overstocks the market. There should be greater diversity In his farming , and the .reports of the Department of Agriculture point out very definitely the field in which this diversity can be profitably exercised. American farmers cannot study prosperity. 

REFORMS IX'TIIE ' AHMV STAFF. C.lft/ , < ! ' ' IlVCOlllllHMKlatlOIlM , of. Hjicrclary Itool. Philadelphia Press. Secretary Jlcot in his annual report has presented the" best scheme for the reform of the army staff and command which has been laid before congress In a generation. With tact and reserve , without harsh criticism , dealing only In reform .and not in condemna tion of existing shortcomings , Secretary Root proposes to create here the same system of education , appointment and promotion for staff positions which the experience of Ger many , France and all other European coun tries has shown to be wise. "The real object of having an army , " says Secretary Root sententious- ! to prepare for war. The present army staff system by Its appointment and selection does not pre pare for war. " Secretary Root proposes a new one which will. Staff appointments to day are for life. They are made without special previous training , without selection by any competitive process and without the approval and examination of candidates by military experts- . The result Is men like Eagaa and blunders such as disgraced the conduct of the last war. Secretary Root proposes stan ! appointments for five years Instead of for life , an army college where a special staff training shall bo added to the education gained at West Point or elsewhere , and selections for etaft posts by boards of officers. In addition , the secretary proposes that , In future , all army promotions shall be part by seniority aid port by merit. He urges , In short , that the practice of making promotions In a certain proportion by merit , which every one wees and admits Is necessary for efficiency and success In war , sliul ) be maintained also In peace , for the same reason. Our present plan promotes only for seniority In peace. The result Is that we begin our wars with men too old or too weak to be efficient In the higher posts , that new men have to be put up In these posts and that toward the end of the war , after the Putnams , Hulls , Mc Dowells and others are out of the way , there s n chance for the younger Greenes , Jack- sons , Sherldons , Lawtons und the like. If Secretary Hoot's reforms are adopted nnd there Is everything to bo said In their 'avor and nothing against them the com mand of the army and HH staff will buth bo reformed and an efficient army will exist j In pearo Instead of one which has to bo nade efficient by court-martialing the Pagans after war has revealed them. Every other country has a staff college whore the general art of war IH taught. The United States has none. In West Point It has a sound school for olllccrs , though Its curriculum admits of Improvement. It has a strong artillery school and a fair school for ca.valry and ( nfantry. Its army engineers ' neers advance In 'civil , but not In military engineering , though something Is done nt Wlllctt's Point for the engineers still too young to think that an army engineer knuv/s all knowledge. ' A staff college this country lm not. England Ima no trained stuff. This is the reason Its army Is floundering In South Africa. Secretary Root's new army college would really bo a staff college. Still moro , he pro poses to recognize work done at the other army schools as entitling men to staff an- polntmept and promotion. Personal favor itism , family and social Influence , which have done the staff tenfold more harm than political patronage , though the latter ls talked about tenfold as much by the news papers , Mr. Root cuts up by the roots with bis special army beards fur staff appoint ment and promotion. Lastly , the staff bureaucracy Is'broken up by temporary staff appointments such as General Miles and every' other general commanding the army , B Urged for thirty years. | Moat War Department annual reports are i mere summaries of the bureau chiefs , the secretary becoming a sort of megaphone for staff cranks. Secretary Root Instead has mapped a lucid , logical , practical reform which congrcsg ought without delay to enact Into law , providing liberally for the Increated ccet. iS OF IH'U WAH. I I Several fragments of decayed civilization I bearing an American brnnd. I * ' wrratllnf with the kind Spain grafted on Manila an < ! vicinity. Newspapers fr m the Philippic capital report great activity among horse thieves , bicycle thieves and counterfeiters. The first class of Industrious citizens ap pear to know a Rood l.or. p when they sec one , and evince marko'l tnlent In sequester ing the animal. They Jo not fear such retri bution ns ndcrned thu lenp trees of the west In former times. Bicycle thieves arc graded ns petty crooks , but the men who arc shoving the queer nro getting n warm run for their money. A Manila paper senten- tlously observes that "when civilization Is hurriedly packed for shipment , some of the cans spoil In transit. " The departure from San Francisco last Saturday of the Forty-ninth Infantry ( col ored ) was a picturesque and pathetic event. The San Francisco Call reports that "all the belles of colored society wore down to the wharf to see the soldiers away. There was conslderablo delay In getting the men aboard the transport , nnd during the delay the band ployed n cakcwalk. Immediately every eoldler within hearing began to fidget ; then ( their feet began to shnllle and In a few minutes a couple of hundred of them were dancing awny for dear life. H was the best cakewalk ever seen In San Frnncsico nnd the officers of the transport service and the men on the Warren watched the perform ance with the keenest interest. The men used their guns as walking sticks nnd their flic man as a partner nnd gave an exhibition that would crowd the Mechanics' pavilion every night for a month. The soldiers had only Just finished a flvc-mllo tramp In heavy marching order , but every one of them was ready to dance as soon as the band began to play. Even when marching up the gang way aboard the transport they kept up the dance and only etoppod with the music. " The pathos of the parting was rudely spoiled by a gutter band , which came upon the scene merrily piping , "Ah Uoan' Call' Ef Yo' Nevah Com' IJack. " Joke foundries nnd paragraphers ought , In justice to a maligned profession , give the messengers a real and turn their attention to that which has achieved a record rivalIng - Ing the snail. Constitutional aversion to haste has reached its highest development In that portion of Uncle Sam's transport service paid by the day. A sample of the lot Is the transport Pennsylvania , now In the Philippines. Recounting a recent journey from Manila to Jola ( pronounced Ole ) a correspondent of the New York Sun says : "In the order for the journey of the transport an absence from Manila of ten days was contemplated. Dut the Pennsyl vania wan built in the daya when fifty or sixty pounds was n liberal working allow ance of eteam. She -was intended to carry all the freight there was at one trip , si that she could take her time nbout It am not hurry back for the rest. Now when shi is under charter to the government foi something like $800 a day , the foresight o her builders becomes a matter of amaze ment. And a voyage In the transport Is ; matter of weeks Instead of days. "The captain of the ship Is a red-facei fat man , from England originally , aptlj named Broouiheod , but It Isn't so thick tha It can't see that every day of delay mean : an additional ? SOO in the pockets of the owners. In command of the recruits ot the southward voyage was another red-facei fat man , from Tennessee , by circumstance J major , by law a gentleman , and by nature one of the kindliest souls that ever lived The accident of birth named him James , but that did not hide him. He lived to be one of the few great ones chosen by fate to read their own obituary notices In the news papers and to send home to their admiring friends marked copies of the glowing eulo gies. , ; ; The accident of early. , association named him Cupid , probably because the dis cerning young men who surrounded'him in the military academy at West Point saw that It must have been he , In one of his anterior incarnations , who served as model when Raphael painted the cherubs and the Slstine Madonna , just as In his ulterior in carnation he certainly will be a cherub and sport about In white wings. Ho worked with might and main and spared neither himself nor his one suit of khaki to get the men In his charge off the ship , and then when the recruits from Cebu were to go on board he personally Inspected all their papers to see that all were right , thereby attesting the accuracy of the printed forms , many of which he compared , and winning forever the heart of the skipper , by causing a delay of two days. " "The Americans have changed things very much in Jolo , but in no particular more than in the relations of those Inside the walls to those outside them. Now the Mores come up to the outposts with as many arms as they like , and the old block house that stands just outside the main south gate is recognized by natives and for eigners alike as a market , where the Mores congregate In large numbers every day to sell whatever arms they can to the Ameri cans. Some of their weapons uro very curious and the Americans have bought a great many of them for souvenirs of the place. As a consequence the price has gone away up.as in fact every price has wherever the Americans have touched these Islands. AVbenever a steamer drfips an chor In Jolo bay the word goes out among the Mores very quickly and immediately they flock to the market with all eortw of wares. The Pennsylvania came to anchor a little after 3 o'clock on an afternoon when ono of the brothers of the sultan had come over with some companions from Malbun , where the sultan llv < , to have a conference with General Hates. They rode straight over the hills from the south side of the island to the north , and when the confer ence was finished they rode straight back again. On their homeward wny they upreai the news that a new American ship was It port , and the next morning there were 

DION renders of arms at the market than could get inside the old blockhouse.

" j Philadelphia Times ( ilctn. ) : Genrral Hen derson la one of the very few men Hlnro Urn days of Clay who WBB called tn hl.M tire I elec tion ns sneaker of the house by the upon- taneous action of his party. There were half a score of able nnd experienced men ambitious to succeed Speaker Reed , hilt this drift of public sentiment became so strong In fnvor of General Henderson that all ot his competitors voluntarily retired , and many months before the meeting of congress ho ! was accorded the speaker's chair by general I consent. Here Is Indeed a rare tribute to I General Henderson , and eminently deserves - , serves It. lie was a gallant soldier In the i civil war and returned to his home maimed | for life , but his great Intellectual power , his Indomitable energy nud hl admirable per- eoniil attributes won for htm not only the confidence and affection of the people of his district , but econ gained for him in public lifo the sincere respect of the country.

Detroit Journal : Hut even the nntl- Boers concede now that General Methuen should have waited till January 1 , 1901 , be fore announcing that ho had fought the bloodiest battle of the century. Chicago News : The British have already lost in killed and wounded about 3COO men. The Boer looses are probably a few hun dred less. And the argument has only begun , -\vhlle \ the British have not yet reached the enemy's frontier. Judging from the skill , courage and stubbornness shown by the Boers the war may easily last a year , 3 ruin the burghers , cost England the grcat- JI est expenditure of men and money which 2 " jehe hcs had to bear for almost a century nnd \ lose the uitlanders more than they can re gain In twenty years of Industry. New York Sun : The latest reports of the armament of the circle of forts defending Pretoria la that they are mounted with twenty-four and twenty-slx-centlmeter guns besides a number ot guns of smaller caliber and quick-firing. The supply of projectiles and expletives Is said to bo ample for a prolonged siege , and the small arm ammuni tion that -vfaa laid in before the war began amounted to 36,000,000 cartridges. In con nection with this provision a curious story is told. About two years ago the Trans vaal government caused Inquiries to be made as to the consumption of rifle ammunition by the German army during the Franco-German war , and being informed that the total quan tity was 18,000,000 It was Immediately de cided to lay in double that quantity. St. Ijouls Republic : Both sides in the British-Doer war are entitled -to whatever oolaco the reflection brings that the blcodleat battle of the nineteenth century will not be fought during Us declining years. It Is cer tain that this distinction will not fall to the lot of the battle of Modder river , whatever the Iocs of life. It will not even be the bloodiest battle the British fought during the present century. The nineteenth century yields to none in the sanguinary character Of its conflicts. To be the bloodiest of the nineteenth century a battle must discount Waterloo in 1815 , when the Duke of Welling ton alone lost 1,756 killed. Its losses must bo moro severe than at any battle of the American civil war than , for Instance , Get tysburg , where the federal dead numbered 3,070 and the confederate 4,000 ; or than Spottsylvania , where 3,288 federals were killed and 19,278 wounded , as against 3,342 confederates killed and 20,187 wounded ; or than Chlckamauga , where the federal and confederate dead numbered respectively 1,614 and 6,000.
