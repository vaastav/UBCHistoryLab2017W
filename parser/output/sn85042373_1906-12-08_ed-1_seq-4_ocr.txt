There is need of and there is profit in the high est, deepest and broadest possible ed ucation for the farmer, but there is nobody who can so well afford to es chew visionary fads and speculations. The science of agriculture is as truly a science as any with which the learned world is concerned, but it is pre-eminently a cautious, conservative and practical science. Nor may it be amiss to note, not to our national credit, that, apparently because of those very qualities of ne cessity, agriculture has not always re* ceived the encouragement and aid which have been given by the nation to Borne other industries. Manufac tures and commerce have been objects of paternal solicitude, of stimulation and of protection, while agriculture has more largely been left to "hoe its own: row" and to depend upon natural advantages. It .was well to do what was done for those others and it would be welt if a generous measure of the same solicitude were exercised though perhaps in different ways, toward this greatest of all our indus tries. There can be no more au spicious sign of the times than for ag riculture to receive from the nation as well as from persons in their individ ual capacities an attention propor tionate to Its magnitude and its im portance. POLITICAL DEMAGO0RY. President Roosevelt in his annual message to congress did more than point out the legislation which is needed by the country at this time. He successfully wielded the big stick at the heads of those so-called reform ers who attempt to w:n success by hysterical plays to the galleries. Dis cussing this matter he said: The sinister demagogues and fool ish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of des truction sometimes seek to associate themselves with thuse working for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and sometimes mas querade as such reformers. Moreover, while such preaching and such agitation may give a certain notoriety to some of those who take part in it, and may result ia tie tem porary political success of others, is the long run every such movement "will either fall or else will provoke a violent reaction, which will itself re sult not merely in undoing the mis chief wrought by the demagogue and the agitator, but also in undoing the good that the honest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully and laboriously achieved. Corruption is never so rife as in communities where the demagogue and the agitator bear full sway, be cause in such communities all moral bands become loosenend, and hysteria and sensationalism replace the spirit of sound Judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. Roosevelt is hot a demogogtfe not can he be charged with insincerity. The American people know him too well- to believe that he used these words idly to fill space in a .mes sage which he well knew would be come a part of our national history and would be read and pondered by his fellow men a century hence. There can be no doubt but that he meant every word which was uttered and weighed well its import before he used it. The truth is Just as he pointed out in his message, that no reform has ever been accomplished through the instrumentality of agitators. Neither do reforms among free people come in the character of revolution. When the first concession of liberty was wrested from King John at Runny mede, it was not the work of a day nor of a year. For a long time the matter had geen growing and when the opportune time arrived there was nothing left for a reluctant king to do but grant the demands of the barons. The accomplishment of our indepen dence was another illustration of the same principle. The foundations of our liberty were laid long be fore the common at Lexington was drenched with the blood of the first dead patriots. The French revolution might be taken as the illustration of demagogury and fanaticism in the af fairs of mankind rather than the evo lution. Fanaticism took the place of judgment and frenzy the place of pa triotic courage. The guillotine was the supreme court of the land and the streets of Paris and (the vine-clad vales of France ran red with the blood of the innocent. That condition was the result of the work of dema gogues of the same kind as those to whom the president refers in his mes­ sage, and the danger to the free in stitutions of this country from this source are Just as great as they were to France more than a century ago. These waves of fanaticism may re act and in doing so leave the country where it was before, but tho more probable thing is that once the discon tent with the exist'.ng order of thtngs is created it will smoulder and remain suppressed, but in time will burst forth with renewed energy and bring a greater destruction. Minot is endeavoring to secure a state normal school, and it is not among the impossibilities that it will be successful. That the western portion of the state should have some educational institution cannot be dis puted. The larger part of the popu lation is in the western half, and while the slope has the reform school and the penitentiary it is a regretta ble fact that they are used as much by the people from the eastern coun ties as they are by those from the west. The education of the young people of the state is the most import ant part of its responsibility to Us citizens. Especially is this true of those who are to become the teachers of the rising generation. That occu pation is no longer considered a prop er means of earning money during the period "when the teacher is experi menting. They are now expected, and in fact required, to be qualified for the work of developing the intellect by understanding its nature and needs. In a word the teachers must be qualified to do scientific teaching. This qualification can only be se cured through the medium of the nor mal schools and the more of them the state has, the better will it be pre pared to fulfill the obligation of the commonwealth to the children. The state needs another normal school and Minot deserves the advantage of the location more than any other town in the state. It is to be hoped that the legisla ture will forget politics long enough to consider and pass a road law for the state providing for the construc tion of high grade public ways leading to the principal cities. This matter has been discussed before in these columns and it has been pointed out that the construction ot good roads from the agricultural sections into the larger towns serves to increase the importance of the towns and at the same time to save expenses for the farmers who are enabled to reduce the cost of marketing their products be cause of the improved conditions in the roads. It is true that the frozen condition of the roads in winter and the solid condition during the greater part of the summer limits the time in which the roads need special atten tion. But that time is in the fall— during the wet season—when the farm ers must use the roads most for the marketing of their grain. In some parts of the state the roads are so bad during this time that the crops cannot be marketed over them. Min nesota has met the condition to some extent by providing for the construc tion of certain roads according to modern systems in different parts of the state. The only defect is that there is no provision for uniting the several sections into a general sys tem. A similar law with this change would be a good thing for this state, leaving its adoption a matter of local option, so that it need not be en forced in the newer parts of the state until they were sufficiently settled. It is decidedly amusing to see the democratic Alex. McKinzie trying to get the democrats of the state to leave Governor Burke well alone so far as urging appointments upon him is con cerned and then see the political War-
