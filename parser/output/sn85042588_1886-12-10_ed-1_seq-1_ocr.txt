President Cleveland opens his second message to congress, a document of about 15,000 words with the statement that the United States government is on friendly terms with all ^flier nations. Special at­ tention is called to the extradition treaties with the various foreign powers. Discuss­ ing the case of Cutting he says: Watchful care and intere'st of this government over its citizens are not relinquished because they have gone abroad, and if charged with crime committed in foreign land, fair and open trial, conducted with decent regard for justice and humanity, will be demanded forthein. With less than that, this gov­ ernment will not be content. Experience suggests that our statutes regulating ex­ tradition might be advantageousiy amended by a provision for the transit across our territory, now a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to an­ other, of fugitives surrendered by one for­ eign government to a third state. THE 

CANADIAN FISHERIES. The history of the Canadian fishery troubles is gone over and the matter is re­ commended to early attention. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. Speaking of the international copyright he says: I trust the subjeot will receive at your hands the attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authorities so urgentr ly pressed, will be duly heeded. It is also recommended that discriminating duty on works of foreign artists be abolished. FAVORS GOOD SALARIES. An increase of salaries is recommended for our minis&rs and consuls at foreign countries. COAST DEFENSE. The subject of coast defenses and forti­ fications have been fully and carefully treated by the board on fortifications which report was submitted at the last session of congress, but no construction work of the kind recommended by the board has been possible during the last year from the lack of appropriations for such purposes. The defenseless condition of our sea coast and lake frontier is perfectly palpable the ex­ amination made must convince us all that certain of our cities named in the report of the board should be fortified and that work on the the most important of these fortifica­ tions should be commenced at once. ANOTHER ASSISTANT. I renew my approval of the recommenda­ tion of the postmaster general that another assistant be provided for the postoflice de­ partment. MORE PENITENTIARIES. In the report submitted by the attorney general to the last session of the congress he strongly recommended the erection of a penitentiary for the confinement of prison­ ers convicted and sentenced in the United States courts and he repeats the recom­ mendation in his report fbr, the last year. This is a matter of very great importance and should at once receive congressional action. United States prisoners are now confined in more than thirty different state prisons and penitentiaries situated in every part of the country. With prisoners under its own control, the government could deal with the somewhat vexed question of con­ vict labor, so far as its convicts were con­ cerned, according to a plan of its own adoption and with due regard to rights and interests of our laboring citizens, instead of sometimes aiding in the operation of a sys­ tem which causes among them irritation and discontent Upon consideration of this subject it might be thought wise to erect more than one of these institutions, located in such places as would best subserve the ning these convicts as at present state institutions would be saved by the adoption of the plan proposed, and by em­ ploying them in the manufacture of such articles as were needed for use by the gov­ ernment, quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realised in partial return for our ontlay. THE 

INDIANS. The report of the secretary of the inter­ ior presents a comprehensive summary of the work of the various branches of the public service connected with his depart­ ment, and the suggestions and recommend­ ations which it contains for the improve­ ment of the service should receive your careful consideration. The exhibit made of the condition of our Indian population and the progress of the work for their en­ lightenment, notwithstanding the many embarrassments which hinder the better administration of this important branch of the service, is a gratifying and hopeful one. '64 4 Eave BISMARCK. DAKOTA. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 10. 1886 The funds appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal year just passed, with the available income from Indian-land and trust moneys,Jamounting in all to $7,850, 775.12, were ample for the service under the conditions and restrictions of the laws reg­ ulating their expenditure. There remained a balance on hand on June 90,1886, of $1,860,02330. of which $1,887,76821 are per­ manent funds, for the fulfillment of treaties and other like purposes, and the remainder, $822^35.09, is subject to be carried to the surplus fund, as required bylaw. The es­ timates presented for appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year amount to $5,608, 873.64, or $412,88620 less than those laid be­ fore congress last year. The present sys­ tem of agencies, while absolutely necessary and well adapted for the management of our Indian affairs, and for the ends in view, was adopted when the stage of Indian management was inadequate, standing alone for the accomplishment of an object which became pressing in its importance— the more rapid transition from tribal or­ ganizations to citizenship of such portions of the Indians as are incapable of civilized life. When the existing system was adopted the Indian race was outside of the limits of organized states and territories, and beyond the immediate reach and oper­ ation of civilization, and all efforts were mainly directed to the maintainance of friendly relations, and the preservation of peace and quiet on the frontier. All this is now changed. There is no such thing as the Indian frontier. Civilization, with the busy hum of industry and the influence of Christianity, surrounds these people at ev­ ery point. None of the tribes are outside of tne bounds of organized government and society, except that the territorial sys­ tem has not been extended over that por­ tion of the country known as the Indian territory. As a race the Indians are no longer hostile, but may be considered as submissive to the" government, as few of them only are troublesome. Except the fragments of several bands, all gathered upon other stations, it is impossible for them to subsist by the chase and the spon­ taneous productions ot the earth. With an abundance of laud, if furnished with the means and implements for profita­ ble industry, their life of entire depend­ ence upon government rations from day to day is no longer defensible. Their inclina­ tion, long fostered by a defective system of control, is to cling to the habits aud cus­ toms of their ancestors, and struggle with persistence against the change of life which their altered circumstances press upon them, but barbarism and civilization cannot live together. THE 

PUBLIC DOMAIN. The recommendations ot the secretary of the interior aud tne commissioner of the general land office looking to the better pro­ tection of public lands and of the public sur­ veys the preservation of national forests, the adjudication of grants to states and cor­ porations and of private land claims and the increased efficiency of tlie public land service are commended to the attention of congress to secure the widest distribution of public lands in limited quantities amoftg settlers of residence and cultivation and thus make the greatest numbers of individ­ ual homes, was the primarygobject of the public land legislation in the early days of the republic. This system was a simple one. It commenced with an admirable scheme of public surveys, by which the humblest citizen could identify the tract npon which he wished to establish his home. The price of lands was placed with­ in the reach of all the enterprising, indus­ trious and honest pioneer citizens of the country. It was soon, however, found that the object of the laws was perverted under the system of cash sales from a distribution of land among the people to an accumula­ tion of land capital by wealthy and specu­ lative persons. To check this tendency a preference right of purchase was given to settlers on the land, a plan which cul­ minated in the general pre-emption act of 1841. The foundation of this system was actual residence and cultivation. Twenty years later the homestead laws were de­ vised to more surely place actual homes in the possession of actual cultivators of the soil. The land was given without price, the sole conditions being residence, im- rovement and cultivation. OtHer laws followed, each designed to encourage the acquirement and use of land in limited individual quantities. But in later years these laws through vicious administrative methods and under changed conditions of communication and transportation have been so evaded and violated that their beneficient purpose is threat­ ened with entire defeat The methods of such evasions and violations are set forth in detail in the report of %he secretary of the Interior and commissioner of the general land office. The rapid ap- Sona ropriatlon of our public lands, without fide settlements or cultivation, and not only without intention of residence,but for the purpose of their aggregation in large holdings, in many cases in the hands of foreigners, invites the serious and im­ mediate attention of congress. The ener­ gies of the land department have been de­ voted during the present administration, to remedy defects and correct abuses in the public land service. The results of these efforts are so largely in the nature of re­ forms in the process and methods of our land system, as to prevent adequate esti­ mates, but it appears by a compilation from the reports of tne commissioner of the gen­ eral land office, that the immediate effect in leading cases which have come to a final termination, has been the restoration to the mass of public lands of 2,750,000 that 2,730, 000 acres are embraced in investigations now pending before the department or courts, and that the action of congress has been asked to effect the restoration of 2, 790,000 acres additional, besides which 4, 000,000 acres have been withheld from reser­ vation, and the rights of entry thereon maintained. TO 

REPEAL LAND LAWS. I recommend the repeal of the pre-emp­ tion and timber culture acW, and that the homestead laws be so amended'as to better secure compliance with and cultivation for the period of five years from date of entry without commutation or provision for spec­ ulative relinquishment I also recommend the repeal of the desert land laws, unless it shall be the pleasure of the congress to so amend these laws as to render them less liable to abuse. As the chief motive for the evasion of the laws, and the prineiple cause of their result in land accumulation instead of land distribution, is the facility with which transfers are made of the right which are intended to be secured to settlers. It may be deemed advisable to provide by legislation some guards and checks upon the alienation of vested rights and lands covered thereby until patents issue. Last year an executive proclamation was issued directing the removal of fences which in­ closed the public domain. Many of these have been removed tn obedience to such, but much of the public land still remains within the lines of these unlawful fences. The ingenious methods resorted to in order to continue these trespasses and the hardi­ hood of the pretenses by which, in some cases such inclosures are justified, are fully detailed in the report of the secretary of the interior. The removal of the fences still remaining, which inclose public lands, will be enforced with all the authority and means which the executive branch of the government Is or shall be invested by the congress for that purpose. PENSIONS. The report of the commissioner of pen­ sions contains a detailed and most satisfac­ tory exhibit of the operations of the pen­ sion bureau. During the last fiscal year the amount of work done was tlie largest In any year since the organization of the bureau, and it has been done at less cost than dur­ ing the previous year in every division. On June 18,1886, there were 365,783 pen­ sioners on the rolls of the bureau. Since 1881, there have been 1,018,735 applications for pensions filed, of which 78,384 were based upon service in the war of 1812. There were 621,754 of these applications allowed, including 60,178 to the soldiers of 1812 and their widows. The total amount paid for pensions since 1861 is $808,624, 811.57. The number of new pensions al­ lowed during the'year ended June 30,1886, is 40,857, a larger number than has been al­ lowed In anyyear save one since 1861. The names of 2,229 pensioners which had been previously dropped from the rolls were re­ stored during the year, and after deducting those dropped within the same time for various causes, a net increase remains for the year of 20,658 names. From January 1, 1861, to December 1, 1885,1,967 private pen­ sion acts had been passed: since the last mentioned date, and during the last session of congress, 644 such acts became laws. THE PATENT OFFICE. On the 4th of March, 1885, the current business of the patent office was on an av­ erage of five and one-half mouths behind. At the close of the last fiscal year such cur­ rent work was but three months In arrears, and it is asserted and believed that in the next few months the delay in attaining an examination of an application for a patent will be but nominal. The number of appli­ cations for patents during the last fiscal year, Including reissues, designs, trade­ marks and labels, equals 40,678, which is considerably in excess of the number re­ ceived during the preceding year. The re­ ceipts of the patent office during the year aggregate $1,250,167.80, enabling the office to turn into the treasury over and above all expenditures $163,701.73. The number of patents granted dnring the last fiscal year, including reissues, trade-marks, de­ signs and labels, was 25,619 also largely in excess of that of any preceding year. The report of the commissioner snows the of­ fice to be in a prosperous condition, and constantly increasing in its business. No increase of the force was asked for. The amount estimated for the fiscal year ending June 30,1886. was $890,760 the amount es­ timated for the year ending June 30,1887, was $853,960. THE SUBSIDIZED RAILROADS. The secretary of the interior suggests a change in the plan for the payment of the indebtedness of the Pacific subsidized roads to the government. His suggestion has the unanimous endorsement of the persons selected by the government as directors of these roads and protects the interests of the United States in the board of directors. In considering thejplan proposed, the sole matters which should be taken into account, in my opinion, re the situation of the gov­ ernment as a creditor, and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its debt. By aj recent^ decision of the supreme court of the ^United States, it has been adjudged that the laws of the several states are Inoperative to ^regulate rates of transportation upon railroads, if such regulation interferes with the rate of carriage from one state into another. This important field of control and regulation having been left entirely unoccupied, the expediency of federal action upon the sub­ ject is worthy of consideration. THE LABOR QUESTION. The relations of labor to capital and of laboring men to their employers are of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen. When these are strained and distorted, un­ justifiable claims are apt to be insisted upon by both interests, and in the controversy wliich results, the welfare of all and the prosperity of the country are jeopardized. Any intervention of the general govern­ ment within the limits of its constitutional authority, to avert such a condition, should be willingly accorded. In ^special message transmitted to congress at its la^f, session, 1 suggested the enlargement of our present labor bureau and adding to its present func­ tions the power of arbitration in cases where differences arise between employes and employers. When these differences reach such a stage as to result in the inter­ ruption of commerce between the states, the application of this remedy by the gen­ eral government might be regarded as en­ tirely within its constitutional powers. 

REDUCED APPROPRIATIONS. The estimates presented fbr appropria­ tions for the ensuing fiscal year amount to $5,608,878.64, or $£$386.20 less than those laid before congress last year. THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, representing the oldest and largest of our national industries, is subserving well the purposes of its organization. By the Intro­ duction of new subjects of farming enter­ wsc&JNm prise, and by opening new sources kf agri­ cultural wealth, and the dissemination of early information concerning production and ^prices, it has contributed largely to the country^ prosperity. The interest of the millions oi our citizens engaged in ag­ riculture, are involved in the enlargement and improvement of the results of their la­ bors and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those whose productive returns area main source of our progress and power. REGARDING PLEUROPNEUMONIA. The existence of pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of the various states, has led to burdensome, and in some oases, dis­ astrous restrictions in one Important branch of our commerce, threatening to ef­ fect the quantity and quality of our good supply. This is a matter of such impor­ tance and of such far-reaching consequen­ ces that I hope it will engage the serious attention of congress. CIVIL 8ERVICE REFORM. The continued operation o£the law relating to our civil service has added the most cohvincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of note that every public officer who has a just idea of his duty to the peo­ ple testifies to the value of this reform. Its staunchest friends are found among those who understand it best, and its warmest supporters are those who are retained and protected by its requirements. The mean­ ing of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those who want places un­ der the government regardless of merit and efficiency, nor by those who insist that the selection for such places should rest upon a proper credential showing active partisan work. It is exceedingly strange that the scope and nature of this reform are so little understood, and that so many things not included within its plan are called by its name. When civil service yields more fully to examination, the system will have large additions to the number of its friends. I invoke for this reform the careful and ungrudging support of the congress. I re­ new my recommendation, made last year, that the commissioners be made equal to other offices of the government, having like duties and resoponslblities and that such reasonable ai be made as will enable ti usefullness of the cause they have charge of. In conclusion I earnestly invoke sucH wise action on the part of the people's leg­ islators as will subserve the public good and demonstrate during the remaining days ot the congress as at present organ­ ized, its ability and inclinations to so meet the people's need that it shall be gratefully remembered by an expectant constituency. 

FOREIGN COMMENTS. LONDON, Dec. 6.—-The Times, cognment ing on President Cleveland's message, says: "It is fortunate for both parties that the negotiations are in the hands of the governments instead of those of the immediate disputants of the fishery ques­ tion. The opposing interests seem too strong in America for any movement to­ ward free trade." The Standard says: "The president's message is a sensible and statesmanlike production, and eminently pacific through­ out, although in 'describing the fisheries question he throws undue blame on the Canadian spoken strife." fishermen, yet not not a word is hostility or rekindle to awaken 

SENATE. THE CHAMBERFIHUNG IN MOURNING. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The galleries of the senate chamber were filled with specta­ tors when, at 12 m., the second session of the forty-ninth congress was opened. In his prayer, Chaplain Butler feelingly al­ luded to the mourning draperies with which the chamber was hung in memory of the late Senator Pike, of New Hampshire. Pre­ siding Officer Sherman laid (before the sen­ ate several of the annual reports of the heads of departments, which were ordered printed. Resolutions were adopted, fixing the daily hour of meeting at noon, and in­ forming the house and president that the senate was ready to proceed to business. The credentials of Senator Williams, of California, were presented and the oath of office administered. 

HOUSE LITTLE INTEREST IN THE MESSAGE. The house was called to order at 12 o'clock, 241 members answering to the roll call. The reading of the president's mes­ sage was listened to with much attention, until that portion which discusses the tariff question had been read, when interest slackened and the remainder of the mes­ sage found few listeners. The document was then ordered printed and referred to the committee of the whole. The speaker announced the deaths of the late congress­ men from New York, Louis Beach and John Arnet, Jr., and Mr. Caswell, of Wis­ consin, announced the death of his col­ league, W. P. Price. A committee was ap­ pointed to attend Mr. Price's funeral, and then, as a mark of respect to his memory, the house adjourned. Connection* with the Canadian Pacific.

Day Has the Almost Unan­ imous Endorsement of the Da­ kota Democracy, But the President is Personally Ae quainted with Church and May Appoint Him. Who Will Be Governor? 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—[Special.] For many reasons the admission of Dakota as a whole is a democratic policy, and, there­ fore, the policy of the administration. Hence, this question figures largely as an element in determining the successor of Governor Pierce, which, however, may be settled before this letter is read, for the' matter is now being considered by the president and Secretary Lamar. M. H. Day has received for this position the almost unanimous endorsement of the Dakota democracy, but the stand he took before congress last winter in advocating a division of the territory operates now se­ riously to his prejudice. Mr. Day, how­ ever, is shrewd and, to put a quietus upon any doubt of his loyalty which his attitude on the division question might suggest, has here in his interest Mr. L. G. Johnson, wno last winter was one.of the most active workers under direction of the democratic committee for integral admis­ sion. Mr. Day believes the easiest solu­ tion of the "division" to be a submission of the auestion to a vote of the people. This certainly is the most popular plan, irrespec­ tive of party but to a democratic adminis­ tration it appears too neutral to possess much political virtue. President Cleveland is personally ac­ quainted witli Judge Church, of Huron, and knows him to be a man of ability, thoroughly reliable, and not disposed to antagonize the policy of the administra­ tion respecting the admission of Dakota. Hence, although it is impossible to pene­ trate the clam-Tike reserve of the executive departments, it is altogether probable that Judge Church will receive the appoint­ ment—not that the president respects the wishes of the territorial democrats less, but the interests of the party more. This wtll be better understood when it is con­ sidered that the president attaches the highest importance to the admission of Da­ kota and desires to so arrange that at the critical moment, which will likely trans- pire under the official life of the next gov­ ernor, the powerful Influence of the federal government may meet with no local resistance in shaping political ends. Thus you will see the political bias of the state may be cut after tne Jeffersonian pat" tern. It is believed that a strong effort to se­ cure Dakota's admission this winter will be made by the friends of the territory, of whom Congressman Springer is conspic­ uous. It is worthy of note that Congressman Hill, of Ohio, who last winter fought ably, but alone, for "division," was not re-elected, and some of his democratic brethren are inclined to attribute his defeat to that one fact Be this as it may. it would seem to verify by antithesis that "United we stand." Much speculation is indulged in over the Dakota land offices, and it is not improb­ able that within a very few days changes will be made at Bismarck, Grand Forks and Mitchell. In the race for the Mitchell office Cant. Geo. S. Nave seems to be ahead with chances largely in his favor. Judge Bangs will probably succeed tothe registership of the Grand Forks office, while the twin position will likely be given to Mr. Jno. IL lull, who Is endorsed by-Sec­ retary McCormack and Ordway Johnson. Mr. Day is urging the appointment of the Hon. A be Boynton to retire Reafrom the Bismarck office. an open question. Marshal Maratta and Commodore Coul son are expected to arrive within a few days for the purpose, it is asserted, of mak­ ing it lively for the gubernatorial candi­ dates.
