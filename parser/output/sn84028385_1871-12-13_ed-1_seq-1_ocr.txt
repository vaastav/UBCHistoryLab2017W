LONGFELLOW. M Had'st thou stayed, I mast bave fled V inat is what the tsion said. In his chamber all alone. Kneeling on the floor of stone. Prayed the Monk in deep contrition, For his sins of indecision. Prayed for gTeater self-denial. In temptation and in trial ; It wsa noonday by the dial. And the Monk was all aioue. Suddenly, as if it lightened, An unwonted splendor brightened U within him and without him In that narrow cell of stone ; And he saw the Blessed V ision Of our Lord, with light Elyaian Lake a vesture wrapped about him. Not as crucified and slain, Not in agonies of pain. Not with bleeding bands and feet, Did the Monk his Master see : But as in the Tillage street. In the honse or harvest field. Halt and lame and blind be healed. When he walked in Galilee. In an attitude imploring, Hands upon bis bosom crossed. Wondering, worshipping, adoring, Knelt the Monk in rapture lost. Lord, he thought, in Heaven that relgn- est Who am I, that thus thou deignest To reveal thyself to me T Who am I. that from the center Of thy glory, that thou shouldst enter This poor cell, my guest to be ? Then amid his exaltation, Loud the convent bell appalling, From its belfry calling, calling, Rang through court and corridor. With persistent iteration He had never beard before. It was now the appointed hour, Whea alike, in shine or shower. Winter's cold, or summer's heat. To the convent portals came, AH the blind and halt and laine. All the beggars of the street, For their daily dole of food Dealt them by the brotherhood ; And their almoner was he. bo upon his bended knee. Rapt in silent ecstasy Of divinest self-surrender. Saw the Vision and the Splendor. Deep distress and hesitation Minded with his adoration. Should he go, or should he stay T Should he leave the posr to wait Hungry at the convent te, Till the Vision passed away f Should he slight hia heavenly guest, Slight his visitant celestial or a crowd of rareed. bestial Beefrara at tbe convent (rate? Would the Vision, there remain T Would the Vision, come again T Then a voioe within his breast Whispered, audible and clear As if to the outward ear ; Do thy dutv, that is best: Leave unto thy Lord the rest ! " Straightway to his feet he started, And with a longing look intent On the blessed Vision bent, Slowly from his cell departed. Slowly on his errand went. At the gate tbe poor were waiting, Looking through the iron grating, With that terror in rhe eve That is only seen in those Who amid their wants and woea Hear the sound of doors that close. And a-f feet that pus them by ; brown laminar witn aisiavor. Grown familiar with the savor Of the bread by which men die ! cut to-oay, they know not why, Like the gate of Paradise Seemed the convent gate to rise. Like a sacrament divine Seemed to them the bread and wine. n his heart the Monk was pravinir. Thinking of the homeless poor, , nat they auner ana enaure ; What we see not, what we see ; And the inward voice was saying: "Whatsoever thing thou doest To the least of mine an d lowest. That thou doest unto me ! " Unto me, but bad the Vision Come to him in beggar's clothing, Come a medicaat imploring, Would he then have knelt adoring, hare listened with derision. And have turned away with doatbing? Tbns bis conscience put tbe question. Full of troublesome suggestion ; at length, with hurried pace, Toward his cell he turned his face ; And beheld the convent bright With a supernatural light. Like a luminous cloud expanding Over floor and wall and ceiling. Bnt be paused with awestruck feeling the threshold of bis door, For the Vision still was standing he left it there before, When tbe convent bell appalling, From its belfry calling, calling, Summoned bira to feed the poor. Through the long boor intervening bad waited his return, And he felt hia bosom burn. Comprehending all tbe meaning, When the Bloeaed Vision said, Hadst thou stayed, I must bave fled 1" I I PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To (Tie.

CHASTISEMENTS AND DISASTERS DURING THE YEAR. The year has, nnder a wise Provi dence, been one of general prosperity to the nation, it has. however, been attended with more than usual chas tisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country and to develop a friendship ror us on uie part or iorelgn nations, which goes far towards alleviating the distresses occasioned bv these calamities. The benevolent who have so far generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes will reap their rewards in the con sciousness of having performed a noble act, aod in receiving the grateful thanks of the men. women, and chil dren, whose sufferings they have relieved. RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. TRIES. The relations of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly.. The year has been an eventful one in witnessing two great uwuu Kjxraaing one language and having one lineage, settling, by peace ful arbitration, dismites of Ion? standing, and liable at anv time to bring those nations into bloody and hostile conflicts. An example has tllUB been set. which. fT siKvxx.ei'iil in i fin. I io.,. k fn other civilized nations and be tbe final means of returning to productive industry millions of men now main tained to settle the disputesof nations by the bayonet and the broad-sword. THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to. which has been concluded since the adjournment of congress with her unttanlo Majesty, and a copy of the Protocols of the conferences of the commissioners by wuuuj ii was negotiated. 1 ills treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between tbe two nations, various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recom mend congress at an early dav to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at ueneva, and for the several commissions on the part of the United States called for by tbe treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the Presi dent of the Swiss Confederation,' and His Mnjesty tbe Emperor of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request oi tne two powers to name an arbitrator, for the tribunal at Geneva. and I have caused my thanks to be suituDiy expressed lor the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with by the appointment of genu emeu of experience ana learning to these important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint wish of the two governments, and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed water boun dary between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties i n the Treaty have undertaken to regard as betweeu themselves certai n pri nclples of public law for which the United States have contented from the commencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of the other maritime powers, and to Invite them to accede to them. .Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which tne invitation is to be extended to the powers. I recommend the legislation necessary on the part or the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to the matters touching me relations ot tne united states towards the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legislation shall be naa on the part of Great Britain and its possessions. It is much to be de- sired that this legislation may become CO-o Iterative before lha fishermen nf the United States begin to make their arrangements lor tne coming season. I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted here with, to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michi gan, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the government of those states respectively the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of Uie treaty Srsr lilt VI ASWfe rATln l- 1 n f An 1,-. r. W t.n which contemplates the use of the canals on either side, connected with tne navigation of tbe lakes and rivers, forming tbe boundary in terms of equity by tbe inhabitants of bo'h countries. It is hoped tbat the im' portanceof the object, and the benefits to flow therefrom, will secure tbe ap proval ana legislative sanction oi the states concerned, I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining tbe true position of the forty-ninth paral lei of latitude, where it forms the boundary between tbe United States and the British North American pos- iD.",.Ween x7dtB"mitof..the??Pky - ' ;u"u" UI "u' gress on this recommendation named would nut it in thu nnwor nf (ha War I .Z.::;-r:r"Z,Tk7',vluoa ri;..uu.u..r.c.,m,Uu,Cutiu uuring tne next summer. PROTECTION FO GERMANS IN FRANCE. The resumption of diplomatic rela- tlona between franca and Germanv has enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection xtended to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular represen- tttives in the country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection oas oeen periormea oy tne Minister and the Consul General at Paris and the varinna Ponaulu in I F ranee under the supervision of the I latter with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the Uernian government and has wound- f ed no susceptibility of the French, Tbe government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United States and a desire to harmonize with the moderate and just policy which this government ruaiutains iu its relations with the Asiatic powers, as well as with the South American Kepubiics. 1 have given assurance that the friendly feelings of tbat government are fully shared by the U lilted btates.

Tbe two powers have agreed in their treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war THE SPANISH MIXED COMMISSION. The forty-first Congress, at Its third " .1 session, made an appropriation for the organization of a Mixed Commis- sion for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out or the insurrection in Cuba.

THE 

CATACAZY DIFFICULTY. The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is proof that there is no desire on the part or his govern mnr tn iirini.,r. ti.o mniiuiitv f those relations. Tbe hospitable re ception which was given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that government. The inexcusable course of tbe Rus sian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline to longer receive that func tionary as a diplomatic representative. It was impossible with self-respect or with a just regard to tbe dignity of tbe country, to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse with this government after the abuse of government officials, and during If' persistent interference, through vari ous means, with tbe relations between tbe United States and other powers. In accordance with ray wishes this government has been relieved ot fur ther intercourse with Mr. Catacazy. and the management of the aflairs of tbe imperial Legation has passed Into the. naiias or a gentleman entirely unobjectionable. - SELECTION OF AMERICANS FOR OFFICES IN JAPAN. With Japan we continue to main tain intimate relations. The cabinet of the Mikado bas, since the close of the last session" of Congress, selected citizens of tbe United States to serve in offices of importance in the several departments of the government. I have reason to think tbat this selec tion is due to an appreciation of tbe disinterestedness of tbe policy which the United States bas preserved toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspondence transmitted here with shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its established course. THE COREAN WAR. Prompted by a detire to put an end to tbe barba rous treatment of our shipwrecked sailors on the Corean coast, I instructed our minister at Pekin to end eavor to conclude a con vention with Corea for securing the safety and humane treatment of such uiMIUCIS, AUlUllO! 4vuers WW 111' structed to accompany him with a sunicient force to protect him in case oi need.

DISTURBANCES IN CUBA. It is to be regretted that the dis turb condition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance ana anxiety. The existence or a pro tracted struggle in such close prox imity to our own territory, without apparent prospects or an early ter mination, cannot be other than an object of concerft to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the aflairs of other powers, naturally desires to see every country in the undisturbed eniovment of neace. liberty and the blessings of free insti tutions, uur naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives of bona ride American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag.

It was highly desirable that this rspid diminution should take p!ace, both to strengthen tbe credit of the country and to convince its citizens or their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them, but in view of tbe accomplishment of these desirable ends of the rapid development of tbe re sources of the country, its increasing ability to meet large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that tbe d resent resouroeaor the onuntrv should continue to be taxed In order to continue this rapid payment. I there fore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal- tax laws. I rec ommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobacco in its varions forms from stamps In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate shall be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected un der the present laws alter providing lor the current expenses of tbe government, the interest account and a sinking fund. and that this snrplns be reduced in such manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home, such as medicines compounded, etc, from which very little revenue is derived, bnt which enter into general use. All such articles I recommend be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisa ble, I would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor. I bave not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat all that has been laid before yon in the re port of the Secretarv of the Treasury. but the to to and the and did THE 

COLLECTION OF THE REVENUE. The present laws for collecting reve nues pay collectors or customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at principal ports of ntry particularly, raise the compensa tion "t these officers to a large snm. It has always seemed to me as if this sys tem must at times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession of those offices, to be lsz in their scrutiny of goous entered, to enable tnem nnaiiy to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject. 

GOLD VS. CURRENCY. Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the national cur rency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of tbe country, in keeping up prices of all arti cles necessary in every day life, and it fosters a spirit of grumbling, prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our curren cy, that value constantly and unifoimly approaching par with specie, a very de sirable object will be gained. OPERATIONS OF THE ARMY. From tbe operations of the army in the past year, the expense of main taining it, the estimates for the ensu ing year, and for continuing seaooast and other improvements conducted under tbe supervision or the war de partment, I refer you to the accompa nying report of the Secretary of W ar.

With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely popu lated but all requiring the services of ans the the mall, it is not at present to be ex- pected tbat this department can be I made self-sustaining, but a gradual approach to this end from year to year confidently relied upon, and tbe day is not far distant when the Post Ufflce Department or the uovern ment will prove a much greater bles sing to tbe whole people than it is and the now. 1 he suggestions or the .Tost oi wsnwrueiKisnui uupiuicuieuui iu in j . i.i.j k I me ucpstiuitui picaiucu ui vj mui are earnestly recommenaea to your special attention, especially docu- nientsravorabieto tne consideration or the plan for uniting tbe telegraph self system of the United States with the postai system, it is oeiievea tnax by ble such a course the cost of telegraph ing conld be much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, rendered. would secure a further advantage may the to extending tbe telegraph through least portions Of the country where private enterprise will not construct it- Com-1 merce, trade, anu above an, tneenons bring a people widely separate-1 0f into a community of interests, are al- will ways benefited by a rapid intercom- and munication; Education, the ground to of republican institutions, en-

Careful Investigation was made and it was ascertained tbat in nine counties of that state such com binations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority, having, among otber things, the object of depriving the emancipated class of the substantial benefits of while In the I tbe freedom, and of preventing the free political action of those citisens who ,re nor sympathire with their own views.

Thousands of inoffensive and well disposed citizens were sufferers oy this lawless violence, thereupon on the 13th of October, 1871, a procla mation was issued, in tbe terms nf the law, calling on tbe members of tha combination to disperse within five days, and to deliver to the marshal or military officersof the United States all arms, ammunition, disguises and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issned sus pending the privilege of tbe writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that State. .Direction was given mat with in these counties so designated, per eons supposed, upon creditable lnror mation. to be members of such unlaw ful combination, should be arrested bv the military force of the United States; and delivered to the marshal to be dealt with according to law. In two of said counties, York and 8par- tansburgb, many arrests have been made. At the last aecouni the num ber of persona arrested was 168. Sev eral hundred whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree. were released for the present. These have generally made confession of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised In making test arrests, and notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the judicial tribunal of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authori ties of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be sub mitted to Congress by the Attorney uenerai. THE MORMON PROSECUTIONS. In Utah there stiil remains a rem nant of barbarism repugnant to civili zation, to decency, and to the laws of th united states, 'l emtonai omoers, however, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity, and with a due sense of responsibility in maintaining the majesty or the law.

ESTIMATES. have not given th estimates for support of the government for the ensuing year, nnr the comparative statement between the expenditures forme year just passed and the one nrered ins- kee.nae.ii these flimrea contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly Congress. These estimates have approval to REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES. More thaii six years bave elapsed the last hostile 'gun was fired between the armies 'hen arrayed against each other, the one for the perpetuation, the other for the de struction of the Union. It may well be considered whether it is not now tiaie tbat the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude from tbe ballot, but only establishes the disabilitp to hold office of certain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect officers respecting the views of tbe majority. I do not see the advantage or propriety of exclu ding men from office merely. They were, before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oath to support the Constitution, and admittiag to eligibility those enter taining precisely the same views, but of less standing in their communities. It may be said that the former viola ted au oath, while the latter did not The latter did not bave it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted tbey would have broken it as did the for mer ciass. If there are any great criminals distinguished above all oth ers for the part they took in opposi tion to the government they might, in the judgment of Congress, be exclu ded from such an am nest v. This sub ject is submitted for your careful con- Biueraiiuu. VIOLENCE IN THE SOUTH. Tbe condition of the Southern States is unhappily not such as all true patriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake, personal violence or threats to ward persons entertaining political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, pre vents immigration, and the flow of ruuen needed capital into the States lately in reliellion. It will be a hap py condition of the country when the oiu citizens or these states will take an interest in public affairs, promul gate an idea honestly entertained, vote for men representing their views and permit tbe same freedom of ex pression and ballot to those entertain ing different political convictions. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT. Under the provisions of the act of Longress approved ebruary 211,1871. a territorial government was organ ized in the District of Columbia. Its results bave thus far fully realized the expectations of its advocates. Under the direction of the territorial officers a system of improvements has been inaugurated by means of which Wsshington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the Nation's capital. tne citizens or the Uistrict bavins voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount, lor the purpose of con tributing to the adornment of the seat of government, I recommend liberal appropriations on the part of Congress in order that the Government may bear its just share of tbe expenss of carrying out a judicious system of improvements. THE CHICAGO FIRE. P"perly be expended towards t HA TCI f 1 n gT HAW Kll 1 1 .1 1 11 01 HlinnO By the great fire In Chicago the most important of tbe Government buildings in that city were consumed. those burned had already become in adequate to the wants of the uoveru ment in that growing city, and look- ng to the near future were totally naaequate. i recommend, tneretore. that an appropriation be made imme diately to purchase the remainder of tne square on which the buildings stand, provided it can be purchased at lair valuation, and provided the Legislature of Illinois will bass a law authorizing its condemnation for tbe Government purposes and also an appropriation of as much money as the erection of new buildings during the fiscal year. IMMIGRATION. Tbe number of immigrants ignor ant of our laws snd habits and coming into our country annually has become so great, and the impositions prac ticed upon them so numerous and fla grant that I suggest Congressional ac tion for their protection. It seems to me a fair subject for legislation by Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire, the nature of complaints made by immigrants or the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during tbe session of Congress, particularly if tbe subject should re ceive your attention. THE CIVIL SERVICE. It has been the aim of the adminis tration to en force honesty and efficien cy in all public offices. Every public servant who has' violated tbe trust placed in bint has been proceeded aeai not with all the vigor of tbe law. If bad men have secured places it has been the fault of thesystem establish ed by law and custom for making p point merits, or the fault of those who recommend for government posi tions, persons not sufficiently known to them personally, or who give letters endorsing the character of office seekers witheut a proper sense of tbe grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them. A civil service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business men who give a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally responsible for the Integrity of bis friend, and his ability to meet bis obli gations. A reformatory law which would enforce this principle against all Indorsers of persons for public place, would insure greater caution is making recommendations. A salutary lesson bas been taught the careless and the dishonest servants in tbe great number of prosecutions of the last two years. It is gratifying t notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the country bringing to punishment those who have proved recreant to the trust con fided to them, and in elevating to pub lic office none but those who ix.-ss the confidenceof the honest and virtu ous, who, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the commu nity in which they live. In my mes sage to Congrats, one year ago, I urgently recommended a reform in tbe Civil Service of the country. In con formity with that recommendation, Congress, in the ninth section of an act making an appropriation for sun dry civil expenses of the government, and for other purposes, approved March 3d, 1871, gave the neiMary authority to tbe Executive to inaugu rate a Civil Service reform.and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Under authority of said act I con vened a board of gentlemen eininently qualiiied for the work to devise rules and regulations to efiect the needed reform. Their labors are not yet com pleted, but it is believed that they will succeed i.n devhsing a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, tbe head of depart ments and members of Congress, and which will redound to the true inter est of the public service. Atall events the experiment shall have a fair trial. a of of on is a to a nf his CONCLUSION. I have thus hastily summed up thei operations of the government during tbe last year and made such sugges tions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit them with confidence tbat your combined action will be wise, statesmanlike and tbe best Interest of the whcle country. (Signed) IT. S. Grant, President.

H. communicates to the Technologist the following directions for constructing an ice house : An ice house, he says, may be economically built in the following manner, and will give entire satisfac tion, if the dimensions be not less than twelve feet square by twelve feet high for the space to contain the ice. 1'iesuming that the house is only for family use, select a shady position and dig a cellar two feet deep, and let tbe floor or bottom be properly smoothed off with a riegceut of eigh teen inches to the twelve leet, leading to one corner. It should be made perfectly water-tight and smooth with a coating of cement ; and a wall, aUo laid in cement, should be erected therein three feet high, formed ou the top with a rabbet on the inner edge of two sides for the purpose of receiving the joists for the inner lin ing of the house ; make the size any you please, ouly not less than twelve feet square inside; erect on this wall your double frame, carefully boarded with-tongue-and-groove boards on the inside, and made as tight as possible. Pack the space between the inner and outer lining with dry sawdust or tan bark ujt to tbe beginning of the roof; let tbe roof be steep, and also lined inside with boards, but not filled, and let a space under the peak be left open three inches to conduct' the warm air to a ventilator on either side of the peak, secured by wide slats in such a position as to make ingress of rain impossible. Another ventila tor must be placed in tbe center of tbe peak, tbe openings of which must be larger in proportion to the house (say one foot square inside), and entirely secured from rain. Let tbe door for Ailing and taking out be on tbe north side of the gable, arranged like the roof, not filled, and a drain pipe of three to four inches, properly cemented, run from tbe lowest point of the bottom of the pit at least ten feet (fifteen feet is better) under ground, with a good descent for taking off the water, and your house is ready to receive tbe ice, and it will keep it well for all purposes. The filling of the house should be done in this manner: " Place, at tbe bottom of the said pit, clean corn stalks, eighteen inches deep, closely packed aud leveled ; then cut your ice in square blocks, as even square as practicable, and place them on the corn stalks close together, like tiles in a ball ; and when six layers are completed, take a watering pot with middling fine nose, and pour clean water gently over all tbe crevices left, until tbey are closed by the freezing said water; continue the filling, repeating at intervals the wittering process until you reach tbe beginning the roof ; then let tbe ice settle, and if you find tbat the crevices bave not been frozen, choose a very cold day to finish the watering operation. You can then put in ice enough to go half way to the peak, and you can enjoy the luxury of ice until tbe new crop. To make the handling of the ice easy, have a beam extending three feet from the roof outside for block and tackle, and another one inside near the peak for the same purpose; also fix an easy ladder on tue inner wail on tbe Bide where the door is. and the ice can be nicely removed with the tackle and ice tongs without any trouble. When taking the ice some distance from the house, it would be advisable to use a blanket put it in while is being transported, which blanket should always be kept aired, and sbould be cleaned every time it is used. Such a building should be painted from time to time the outside, and whenever the ice finished, the cornstalks should be removed a-id the house well ven tilated, so as to be free from any un pleaaFant odors. If so cared for, it will last a great many yearn, and will require very few repairs. DIDN'T WORK. It is easy to overdo a good thing, and Ilia "slip between the cup and the lip " is so readily found. A me chanic by the name of Dubois, ami resident of the city of Detroit, took drinking, and was speedily trans formed from a bard-working man to drinking sot.
