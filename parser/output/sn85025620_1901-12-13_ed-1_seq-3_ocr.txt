Hog cholera doesn't seem to abate much. It has never been very fatal fc *hia neighborhood, though there have been a few cases every ilttle while for a year or more. It is said to be prevalent around Rushmore at present. But if we have not had many losses in hogs, there is danger that we my '.have some in cattle. John ghore, Isaac Milton and Mike Thompson have each lost-two head, and probably there are others that we have not heard of. It is caused, it is thought, by feeding on the •mutty corn stalks. There seem to be but little chance to do anything for them, for they die in a short Aime after showing signs of being tick.

The president's message, with its suggestions and recom­ mendations will be commented on by almost every paper in the land for the most part, I am inclined to f.hinlr, with approval. 1 think most people will agree that the message is a good one, and that it sets forth the honest convictions of a clear­ headed, patriotic man. We cannot, of course, all see alike but I think we can all feel kindly toward a man whose honest purposes it is to serve his country faithfully and well. Such a man most of us believe President Roosevelt to be and if so let us ac­ cord him the respect and support due his character and position. Robert Shore. ELK.
