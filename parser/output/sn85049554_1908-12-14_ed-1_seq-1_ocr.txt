Washington, Dec. 14.—In an opinion by Justice Holmes, the supreme court today held that E. II. Harriman and Otto Kalin, the latter a New York banker, should not be required to ans wer the interstate commerce commis sioner's questions concerning dealings in stocks between the Union Pacific and other roads to which they refused to make response when the subject was under Investigation in New York. Con struing the decision of the court in a dissenting opinion, Justice Day ex pressed the opinion that the construc tion given the interstate commerce law takes from It all power of investiga tion. Big Victory for Harriman. The case came to the supreme court on cross-appeals by Harriman and the government from a decision of the cir cuit court of the southern district of New York, holding that Harriman should be compelled to make response to most of the questions. It arose in connection with the order of the com mission of Nov. 15, 1906, directing in quiry into the combination of the Un ion Pacific road with such other lines as the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, Northern Pacific, Great Northern, Illi nois Central, Alton and New York Cen tral. This order was very sweeping in character and Intended to develop facts regarding the community inter est between the Union Pacific and oth er roads, tlie(.practices and methods of the roads, rates received, etc. It was also hoped it would bring out facts re garding the transfer of other stocks in the Union Pacific. Harriman Refuses to Answer. When Harrimf.n was put on the stand he declined, in response^ to question, to say whether he had owned any of the Alton stock which was pur chased by Union Pacific and the price of which had been fixed by himself whether a portion of the stock of the Illinois Central had been acquired by a pool of which he was a member with a view of1 selling it to the Unioh Pa cific whether the Union Pacific direc tors were interested in the New York Central stock which was acquired by the Union Pacific, and hoW much stock of the Santa Fe was owned by direc tors of the Vnion Pacific. The cir cuit court directed Harriman to reply to these questions and he responded by appealing to the supreme court. Much interest has been felt in the case be cause of its very great importance. Announcement of the court's decision was listened to with deep interest by those present in court. The opinion re versed .the decision of the lower court insofar as it compelled response, and affirmed'the portion In which the court refused to compel such response. It is a sweeping victory for Harriman and his associates. MR.
