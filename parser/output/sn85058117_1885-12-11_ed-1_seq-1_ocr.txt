Wanted Over John Fcv More Foreigners Wanted Anyway WASHINGTON December lOThe Pacific Coast delegation in Congress came to Wash ington with if possiblemore positive anti Chinese views than ever They claim that the legislation which was designed to put a top to Chinese immigration has not proved effectual and they insist on more stringent measures The statement is made that eighteen thousand Chinese have entered the country during the year of which number at least four thousand entered fraudulently Congress will be asked to pass legislation that shall hereafter peremtorly shut out these people from our borders It will be I necessary to look into this question of immi gration frankly and in full and deal with it soberly and wisely It is not unlikely that the time is near at hand when the country i will find it desirable to change its historic J policy of hospitality Many people have the idea that it is the part of duty and our mis sion to offer an asylum to the poor and op pressed of other nations but we are under no obligation either political or moral to assume such a charitable office for distressed mankind In the past we have welcomed the stranger not wholly from benevolence but in part at least because we could advantageously vantageouSly sot him to work We felt that we had a large contract on our hands in the shape of a continent to subdue and were glad of stout arms and hearts from abroad Bat times change and we change with them On every side the cry now goes up that a crowded population isf making competition a I farce and the chances of snccess in each case less labor is organizing from Calais to San Francisco to protect its wages against this surging sea of supply In this emergency it is a grave question how to treat immigration and especially such immigration as holds aloof from citizenship and native society and it is not a question to be settled by cant and reiteration of commonplaces If the majority of the peo pIe of the United States do not want any more foreigners of this undesirable class to se ttle here they have a perfect right tQ say I so and to put this preference into law V Eight Bourn a Day WASHINGTON December lOThe Federa tion of Labor Unions of the United States and Canada resumed its session today and rook up for consideration the resolution providing viding that the eighthour rule shall take effect from May first next The question used general debate and developed a diversity versity of opinion as to the best method of accomplishing the desired result Some of the delegates favored a gradual adoption some proposed a fine for working over hours while others urged that double pay be exacted acted for extra work and others again advo cated a general consultation with the employers ployers in order to secure united action On reassembling at 2 oclock the eight hour resolution was passed with the amendment that while it shall go into force May 1st such organizations as were not ca pable of doing so at the time lend their as sistance to those who would undertake to carry out the resolution A discussion of the subject of arbitration showed that many unions considered arbitration as first neces sary before resorting to boycotting and trikins V I I Washington Will Secure Grants Monument WASHTKQTOK December 10A general del has been issued from the headquarters of the G A E informing the

provide for the establishment of a postal telegraph Be ferred to the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads In introducing the bill Mr Edmunds said it was the same bill he had introduced at the last session of Congress which went to the Committee on Postoffices and Postroads and was reported upon by that committee so late in the session thai the subject could not be considered by the V Senate before the expiration of the session He hoped thp committee wouldnow take the earliest opportunity to reportit A resolution offered by Mr Morrill was agreed to ordering the payment from the contingent fund of tho Senate of the actual and necessary expenses of the Senate com mittee appointed to attend the funeral of General Grant McPhersoii presented a jointresolution of the Legislature of New Jersey recommend ing a Congressional inquiry into the fitness of a portion of the Territory of Alaska for tho purpose of a penal colony for long term or lifeterm convicts Referred to the com mittee on

Gray of Massa chusetts and Henry Coppe of Pennsylvania and also appointing on the same Board General Meigs of Washington in V place of General Sherman rendered ineligible by the removalof his residence from Washington Dolph introduced a bill to repeal the law of last session providing for a settlement of the claims of officers and enlisted men of tim army for the loss of private property des troyed in the military service of the United States This is the law to which the Presi dent calls attention in his message as indefi nite in its terms and on which he says If it is to remain on the statute books it needs amendment In moving a reference of the bill to the committee on military affairs Dolph cited the Presidents comments and had the clerk read from the report of the Secretary of War the statements that offi cer with regard to the law in question and to the difficulty experienced in its interpre tation From these statements it appeared that one of the claims presented was for an indemnity for loss of clothing of a family of six another for household furniture des troyed in the great fire in Chicago and an ther for the loss of two gold watches Mr Dolph said he saw no reason why the Gov ernment should act as insurer of the prop erty of officers and soldiers in its army any more than of the property of any more of its servants and agents He objected to the law also upon the ground that it established no limit to the amount of property that should be paid for and that it did not sufficiently ficiently define the character of the articles that were to be covered by its provisions Cookrell saw noreason for any difficulty in the interpretation of the law Logan was opposed to the Government Becoming insurer but the act complained of admitted of no doubt as to its interpre tation The bill was referred to the committee on military affairs By Mr George To establish agricultural xperiment stations in connection with the agricultural colleges in the several
