"Yale scores again." A Yale graduate is about to be appointed by Taft, Yale '78, as a census supervisor in the Penn sylvania district. Nevertheless, Harvard still has an eligible candidate, former President Eliot, for something or other, and may yet score a safety, to escape a complete shutout. WTien President Taft declared (t the outset in his me-tcagp that "the relations of the I'nited States with all foreign government have continued upon the normal basis of amity and good under standing, and are very generally satis factory," be perhaps did not consider there was a "government" in Nicaragua, or one worth calling it.

New Hampshire orchard owners should follow the example of 200 apple growers. representing the orchard districts of the Northwest at the National Apple show, who adopted rules for grading, packing and shipping. Three grades of apples were established, known as "extra fan cy, "tuncy and "orchard run. 1 lie extra funcv" musi be "sound, smooth. practically free from bruises," while the lowest grade apples must be "practical ly sound'' and must not l less t'.mn two inches in diameter.

After various contemporaries have in dulged in sermonizing over our designa tion of the placing of a pool table in the Montpelicr Y. M. C. A. as "revolution ary," the fact remains that the move 1 revolutionary and is proved by the ef forts of the contemporaries to set the plan right in the minds of the public. However, revolutionary as the innova tion is, it is reasonable enough." There is no more harm in a game of pool, played under certain ; conditions, than there is in base ball played under similar conditions; and the game room of tht Y. M. C. A. is just the place to furnish the right conditions for playing it. The game of pool, fundamentally, consists of knocking fifteen balls into one, or all, of six baskets attached to the leve playing surface, using the end of a stick for a . propeller. Of course, there are developed features of the game, which are neither so simple nor so commendable, but they rre features which would scarcely find a place in the Y. M. C. A. room. AMUSEMENT NOTES. "The Third Degree" Recommended to Barre by Montpelicr. "The Third Degree," which will be giv en at -the Barre opera bouse this even ing, was shown at Montpelier last night. and this is what the Montpelicr Jour nl says about it: "The performance of 'The Third De prce' at the Bknehsrd opera house last eening was highly satisfactory; in fact, it was pronounced by nil to be one of the best, if not the best of the produc tions which have appeared in this city for the past two years. The plot was strong and the char acters seemed to catch the idea of the author in every particular, portraying bis thoughts and conceptions to a mitrk ed degree. The heroine of the piece was .Mrs. Howard jennes, jr., the part be ing taken by Mis Marion Kerby, who responded to inumerable curtain calls throughout the course of the play. Her acting was worthy of the highest corn niendsition, and she had the house with her at every stage of the performance. The character of Richard Brewster, the attorney who defended Howard Jeffries, falsely accused of murder taken by (Jeorge Sumner, Was also well portrayed and be came in for a. largo share of the applause which greeted the various dramatic climaxes of the piece. The other characters. Captain Clinton, of the police force. Mrs, Howard Jeffries, sr., and Howard Jeffries, sr., were taken by artists who knew well what was ex pected of them and came fully up to the expectations of the audience. On the whole, the play is worthy of the fiatronage of the theatre going pub lic in every particular and should at tract a large bouse in Barre, where the company goes to-night," Doesn't Work.

Tride goeth before a fall, according to the proverb, but It often hnpjens that tho fall does not take place as ex pected by the cynical observer. Mrs. Benedict, for example, was very proud of her daughter's attainments ot school. Mrs. Henedlct herself had had little schooling, but attempted to make up for it by retailing Margaret's triumphs to her frleuds. One day the minister's wife was call log. "Yes. ma'am." Mrs. Benedict said In reply to a question; "Margaret Is way np In all her classes, 1 can tell yon.

Youth's Companion, Paris Student Restaurants. Student restaurants in Pari are an Institution tbut Americans may well envy. They are run solely for the ben efit of the students, although strangers are welcome. There are certain little formalities that must be observed. For instance. It Is the duty of every cue entering to bow to the uaadame and say, "Boujour, madame," or "Bon soir, madame." according to the time of day. After oue has finished his meal he asks for the "additlone." as the bill Is called. When it Is presented by the trim little waitress It Is con sidered only proper to say. "Mercl, mademoiselle." lie then leaves a tip of 10 centimes, or 2 cents, and, again bowlug to the madame and saying "Bimjour" or "BoiiKoir." he Is at liber ty to leave. The highest priced article on the bill of fare Is 75 centimes, or 15 cents, and this In all students res taurants Is a Chateaubriand, a tender piece of beefsteak surrounded with potatoes soufile.

These are simple ques tions, and yet upon their unswer often depends the possibility of nervous health or nervous disease. If the suf ferer discovers that any of the phys ical causes of a nervous breakdown ore In operation It Is obvious that It Is his first duty to fifcht against these causes, to lessen them and If possible to remove thero altogether. In the nest place and this is especially to be noted by nervous women one of the essential conditions of nervous bal ance is the control of the emotions. The tendency on the slightest provoca tion to give way to a paroxysm of tears Is dangerous, because It leads to weakness, bodily and mental. No doubt there are moments of poignant agony when tears are nature's benefi cial provision for some relief to an overstrained nervous and mental or ganism, but these moments come at rare Intervals in our lives, and, as a rule, so far from weakening our men tal or moral life, they uplift and purify It. What nervous people must be warned against Is the tendency to let themselves go because of some petty worry or some slight domestic differ ence or through some morbid Impulse to self pity. Rot. S. S.

The newspapers which, expected pyro technics and the unusual in the presi dent's annual message were greatly dis appointed, for there was neither a dis play of fireworks nor a departure from ! the ordinary run of messages from th executive to the legislative branch of the United States government. And one ought really to expect nothing else. A president's message is, or should be, a resume of the events during the period covered by it, a summary of the acts and failures and some calm lecommendations for making up for the failures and for meeting new conditions. Inasmuch as President Taft's message, delivered yes terday afternoon, did that, it should be considered as satisfactory, even if it did not flaggellate, someone to an inch of his reputation or declare war against an offending nation. In fact .it (the message) bears out the opinion concern ing the nation's present executive, that he is one of the steady-moving,. every day sort of officials and, as such, ealcn. lated to weigh matters thoroughly be fore he commits- himself. In other words, toe Is safe and sane. Ich Dien (I Serve). A good title for sn annuity, which guarantees a certain income, as' true as Ton live, as long as yon live. fSOth year.
