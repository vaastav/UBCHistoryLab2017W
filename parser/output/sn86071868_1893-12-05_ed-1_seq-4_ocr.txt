THE MBSSAGK. Tbe message of President Cleveland, of wr..oh the most salient features are presented in this issue, although a lengtLy document, is not longer than is consistent with the thorough considera? tion c f the affairs of the administration. As is customary, a large proportion of tbe message is dovoted to the reports of the different departments, to which the President, has called particular atten? tion, and urges upon Congress the carrying out of the supgestions therein embodied. With the exception of the report of the Secrotary of the Interior the diHer? on t Departments have summarized the condition of affairs under their ad? ministration in the usual manner. Of especial importance, however, is the re part of Secretary Smith upon the sub? ject of pensions, in as much as a radical change from tbe methods pursued by tho previous Secretary undor Harrison's administration, has been inaugurated. Clevelan i rises to an explanation of tho method pursued in eradicating as far as possih'.i the wholesale perpretration of fraud .nder this department and he couches in no unmistakable language his denunciation of tho nefarious busi? ness by which tho people's money has been gqviandered and the cause of tho honest pensioner injured. In ;.is comment upon the report of the Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Cleve? land further voices his belief in the ultimate beneficial effect of :ho repeal of the silver purchasing clause and inti? mated that a path will soon be dis? closed which will load to a permanent and sound currency system. Tho public, it seems, was correctly informed of the President's view of the Hawaiian situation, and that part of his message is received with loss in? terest than it would have been had they not been forwarncd. Ho fails to state _ ;st what instructions have been given to Minister Willis as to how he should ' undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us," but promises the prompt transmission to ('.ingress tho further developments in the case as they come to hand. I'pon the tariff qusstion the President (hows bis accord with the views formu? lated into the bill conceived by tho waj'6 aDd moans committee, as made public by Chairman Wilson, in as far as it pertains to the romoval of the restric? tions upon the importation of the raw materials necessary to our manu? factures. But ho touches some? what blindly upon tho principle of protection when he states that ?While we snould staunchly adhero to the principles that only tho necessity of revenue justifios tho imposition of tarilf duties and other Federal taxation, and that they should bo limited by strict economy, wo cannot closo our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us which in justice and fairness call for discriminating caro in the distribution of suoh duties and taxation as tho emergencies of our Government actually domand." Ho i6 evidently in favor of tho in crease of some of the internal revenue taxes and tho income tax also moots with his approval as a moans whereby the temporary defloioncy of tho Treasury Kay be helped out. 

MESSAGE BEFORE CONGRESS. Continued from pita* 1 After commenting upon the recent Brussels monetary conference, the President says: It aooms to mo that it would bo wiso to givo general au? thority to the President to invite other nations to such a conference at any limn whon thoro should bo a fair pros? pect of accomplishing an international agroemont on tho subject of coinage. I desire also to earnestly suggost tho wisdom of amending the oxlsting statutes in regard to the issuance of Government bonds. The superintendent of immigration, through the Socrotary of tho Troasury, reports that, during tho last fiscal year, tbero arrived at our ports 440,793 immi? grants. Of these 1,003 wore not per? mitted to land undor tho limitations of tho law, and 577 wore returned to tho countries from whenco they came by reason of their having become public charges. Tho total arrivals wore 141,030 less than for tho provious year. Attorney General's Report. Upon the report of the Attorney Gen? eral the President says: I cannot too heartily endorse the proposition that tho fee system as applicable to tbe com? pensation of Dnited States attorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal courts, and United States commissioners, should bo abolished with as little delay as possi? ble. It is clearly in the Interest of tho community that tho business of tbe courts, both civil and criminal, shall bo us small and as Inexpensively trans? acted as the ends of juBtlce will allow. In commenting upon the report of tho Postmaster Goncral, tho president says that in view of the actual recoipts and expenditures during that part of tho current fiscal year already expired, the present Postmaster General estimates that at its close, instead of a surplus, there will be a deficiency of noarly SS, 000,000. Tho report of the Secretary of the Navy contains a history of the opera? tions of his department during the past year, ann exhibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our Navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which has been made i:i the construction of vessels and makes a number of reccommdations to which attention is especially invited. Tue Secretary of tbe Interior has supervision of so many important sub j^ct that his report is of especial value and interest On the 30th of dune, 1803, there were on tho pension rolls 006,012 names, an increase of .S'.i,944 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1802. <>! these there woro 17 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers; 80 survivors of tho war of 1S12; ."?,425 widows of soldiers of that war; 21,518 survivors of the Mexican war; 3.SS2 sur? vivors and widows of Indian wars: 384 army nurses and 465,045 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The number added to the rolls during tho year was 123,034, and the number dropped was 33,000. Tho first payments on pensions allowed during the year amounted to $33,750,540 08. This in? cludes arrears or tho accumulation between tho timo from which tho allow? ance of pension dates and tho timo of actually granting the certificate. Pemlon Fraud Sized Up. The discovory having been made that many names bad been put upon tho pension rolls by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, tho commissioner suspended paymonts upon a number of pensions which seemed tobe fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete ex? amination, giving notice to the pension? ers, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims, notwithstanding apparent invalidity. Every name fraudulently put upon those rolls is a wicked imposition upon the ktndly sentiment in which pensions have their origin. Every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more c immun, ar.d false anil undeserving pensioners rob tue people not only of their money, but of the patriotic Bentlmont which tbo survivors of a war. fougnt for tho pre? servation of the union, ought to inspire. These who attempt in the lino of duty to rectify these wrongs should not bo accused of enmity c ? indifference to tbe claims of honest \ <terans. The sum expended on accour. t ot pensions'for tho year ending .luno 30, 1803, was $150, 730,407.14. The c immissioner esti? mates that S165,000,ooo will be retjuirod to pay p' nsions during tho year ending June 30, 18114.

GILKBSON & CHILD, 8 M Hatters and Gents' Furnishers. short titun ago constituted tbo public domain, is rapidly falling into privato bands. 11 is certain tbat in the trans? fer the beneficent intention of tbo Government to supply from its domain homos to the industrious and worthy homo-soekors is often frustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with oztortionate purpose between tho land otlico and thoso who, with their families, are invited by tho Uovern ment to sottlo on tho public lands, is a despicable character who ought not to bo tolerated; yet it is difficult to thwart his schemes. Tho recent open? ing to settlement of the lands in tho Cherokee cutlot, embracing an area of 0,50?,t,(Hi acres, notwithstanding the utmost care in framing tho regulations governing tho selection of locations and notwithstanding to tho United States troops, furnished on exhibition, though perhaps in a modified degree of the mad scramble, the violence and tho fraudulent occupation which have ac cotupanied previous openings of public land. 1 concur with tho Secretary In tho belief that these outrageous inci donts cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and I hopo his recommenda? tions in that direction will be favorably considered. The report of the Secretary of Agri? culture will be found excoc-diiiirly In? teresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned in agricultural occupations. On the Ttb day of March, 1S03, there were upon its pay rolls 2,430 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted treasury and tho imperative demand of the people for economy in tho administra? tion of their government the Secretary has entered upon tbo task of ration? ally reducing expenses by tho elimi? nation from tho pay rolls of all persons not needed for an ellicient conduct of the affairs of the Department. The exports of agricultural products from tho United States for tho fiscal year ending June 30, 18H2, at? tained the enormous figure of 5*00,000,000 in round numbers, liting 78 7 per cent, of our total oxDorts. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $015,000,000, being 75 1 per cent, of all American commodities ex? ported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reforence to their destination will show that in almost every lino tbo united kingdom of (ireat Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Tho continued intelligent execu tion of tho civil service laws and the increasing approval by tho peoplo of its opera? tion are most gratifying. The recent ex? tension of its limitations and regula? tions to tho employes of tbo free delivery of the postoftices, which has boon honestly and properly accom? plished by the commission, with tho heart] co-operation of tho Postmaster General, is an immensely important ad vanco in tde usefulness of tho system. I am, if possible, more than even con vinced of tho incalculable benefits con? ferred by the civil service law. The TarlnTtjueatlon. At this time when a depleted public Truasury confronts us, when many of our people are ongagtd in a hard Struggle for tho necessaries of life, and win n enforced economy is pressing on the groat mass of our countrymen, I de? sire to urge, with all tho earnestness at my command, that Congressional legis? lation bo so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of tbe condition of the Treasury and a sym? pathy with tho straitoned circumstances of our follow citizens. The duty of public economy is also of immense im? portance in its intimate and necessary relation to the task, now in hand, of providing revenue to moot Government expenditures, and yet reducing tho peoplo's burden of taxation. After a hard strugglo tarilf reform is directly before us and nothing so im? portant claims our attontion, and noth? ing so cleariy presents itself as both an opportunity and duty; an oportunity to dosorvo tho gratitude of our follow c.ti/.ons, and duty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of tho peoplo. After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided the work of its accom? plishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in tho theory of a reform in tbo public places of the peoplo and their de? sires, if the public officers are really the servants of tbo peoplo and if political promises and professions have any bind? ing forco, our failure to give the relief so long awaitod will bosheor recreancy; nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our efforts until this reform is accomplished by wise and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhoro to tho principios that only tbo necessity of revenue justifies tho imposition of tarilf duties and other Federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy. We can? not close our eyes to tho fact that con? ditions have grown up among us which in justico and fairness call for discrimi? nating caro in the distribution of such duties and taxation as tho emergencies of our (lovernmont actually domand. Manifestly, if wo aro to aid the peoplo directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should bo a reduction in present tariIT charges upon tho necessaries of lifo. The bene? fits of such a reduction would bo palp - ablo and substantial, seen and folt by thousands, who would bo bettor fed and better clothed and bettor sholtorod. These gifts should bo tho willing bono ticiarles of a Government whose highest function 1b the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well being Is tho romoval of restriations upon tho importations of the raw materials ntoossary to our manufactures. The wt rid should bo open to our national inwenuity and enterprise. This can't bo while Federal legislation, through the imposition of high tariff, forbids the American manufacturers as cheap ma? terials as tnoso used by tntir com? petitors It is quite obvious that tho enhance? ment of the price of our manufactured products, reoulting from this policy, not only confines the market for these pro? ducts within our own borders to tho direct disadvantage of our manufac? turers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interestsof our labor aro certainly, though indirectly, involved in this featuro of our tariff bystem. Tho sharp competition and active strugglo among our manu? facturers to supply ihe limited demand for their goods soon fill the revonue market to which they are confined, then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of employes and distress in the homes of our worVQ itig men, evon if the often disproved as sertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free trade materials and low tariff duties. Tho intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady omDloyment permitted by free raw materials, is tbe most imptr tant factor in their relations to taritf legislation. A measure has been proposed by the appropriation Congressional commis sion, embodying tarilf reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patri? otic and unselfish work, and I boliovo it deals with its subject consistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions pormit. I am satisfied that tho reduced tiritf duties provided for in the pro? posed legislation, added to oxlsting internal revenue taxation will, in tho future, though porhats not immedi? ately, producesufficientrevenue to meet the needs of tho Government. Income Tmoa Considered. The committee, after full considera? tion and to provide against a temporary deficiancy which may oxist before tho business of tho country adjusts it89lf to the new tariff schedules, havo wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from I certain corporate investments. These now assessments aro notonly absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can bo remitted without unfavorable business disturbances whenever tho nocessity of their imposition no longer exists. In ray grtat desire for tho success of ?this measure I can't refrain from the suggestion that its success can only bo attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tari If reform, and as a result of their willingness to su? bordinate personal desires and ambitions to the general good. Tho local interests affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted upon the legislation embodying tho reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion, my intense feeling of responsibility impels mo to invoke for tho manifold interest of a generous and confiding people the most scrupulous caro to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advance? ment of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country.
