Toomb's death to the Union dispatch is repudiated by nearly the entire south ern press. Of course. Now let the northern radical press repudiate the stalwp.rt hate breeders in like manner we will be & happy family. These i!Jt<3 m?n in the north, seducers of other men's views, and the two ortbres south ern irreconcilables, are the only causes that remain to keep up a bitterness of feeling between the north and south. The legislative bribery trial has been quashed, on account of a trick of radical hatching—they managed to nave one grand juror, out of tbe '24, not to be sworn, and this irregularity led to the quashing of the indictments, and the radical corruptors of our state legisla ture go free for the present. These rascals have already been prov en guilty by a legislative committee and if tbe trial had not been defeated by this trick, Keinble and his assistant radical corruption gang which attempted to fas ten 4 millions upon the state, would have been sent to state prison. The readers of the Ripoexek will re member that we expressed fears that some game would be hatched to defeat justice. JJMexico would die of inanition if it did not Lave a new revolution ever tw i or three weeks to keen up tbe "circular tion." News has been received by the steams er Newbern from Mazatlan of an im pending revolution in Mexico. Gener al Jeaes Ramirez has pronounced, and some of his forces hare been at liosario, Concordia, Copala, about sixty miles from MazatiaD, and near tbe lines of Tepicand Binaloa. Another small force has pronounced at Cosala, |in the State of Sinalca. The insurgents have also pronounced at Lapaz. About two hun dred and fifty men took possession of the town, and after getting possession of all arms left for the interior. Nothing is Bafo any more under radi cal hands. They have for IS years stol en and rniaappropriated the public monies, stolen the revenues and when a rascal was sentenced he got out by an abuse of the pardoning power. They have used the army and the sword for the basest purposes and to maintain car pet-bagism, carry elections and an - est voters, and have stolen the presiden cy. Now they enter the gtaud jury room to defeat justice by an irregularity, so that indictments against the corruptors of our state legislature may escape pun ishment. llow long will the people vote to tinuethe authors of such iniquities :o power ? The legislative commi'tee to prsoecute the riot-bill gang for attempting to cor rupt legislators, although defended at the late term of the Danphin county court, by a trick as disreputable as their grfme oftjribery, tampering with the grand jury so as to have the trial quashed— the committee we say, will again pro ceed to get at tho guilty republican lead ers, at the January term, when it is • hoped the jury business will he guarded against a game like the one exposed at the late term. It would be an everlast ing disgrace to the state to have Kemble & Co. go unpunished in the face of the evidence of guilt as brought out by [the legislative investigation last winter. These had men have defeated the law for the present, but the net at the Jan uary term can bo made to hold them.

Tin district-attorney and deputy marshals hare been hard at work for two month* getting the evidence. The result is four indictments for polygamy. The grand jury, in their report, aay thatUiey found great diilieulty in obtaining truthful tes timony from the witnewes, who, from their own admissions, and from clreum stance? could, if they would, hare given satisfactory evidence as to the guilt or innocence of parties. The witnesses were unwilling and unreliable, Fape eially so wore the younger persons ap pearing before them. We never knew of colonies of Indians to have such opportunities ottered them and if they had we douht whether the red man, would have shown as discour aging a Knik account. 1 The agent in charge of the White Faith Iteeervatlon in Minnesota report* to the Interior 1 *epartment that the Chippewa Indians have made a very gratifying success of the experiment of raising sorghum in that part of the country. Twenty-live acres upon which the experiment wa# tried last season yielded 100 gallons of svup per acre. The Chippewa* are much pleased with the industry, and next year will plant •J9O teres with aorghnm. The agent re porta that it will grow and ripen upon any lands capable of producing corn. The Chippewaa, about one thousand in number, who were all wild ludians ten years ago, have also this season raised abundant crops of grain and vegetables, and are reported to be happy and con tented. The lIuroXTKB desires to announce to the radical press that thee may soon have another southern "outrage" to howl over, which will l>o when Klita Pinkston—Sherman's Kiiia—is hung for murdering her husband. Kiiia was of great service in the presidential steal, and in the hands of John Sherman played oil bruised and half dead, under perjury, to get up a fictitious outrage. Now that Kiiia has murdered her bus* band, neither Sherman nor the radical press can see a '■southern outrage" there. When Kiiia'a trial comes off let the rad leaders do like in Penn'a, tamper with tlie grand jury. and thus have the indict ment against their dear sister Kiiia quashed. There is hope for Kiiia yet. llalstead of the Cincinnati l v. the most intluential republican paper in Ohio, looks shy at the Grant movement. In his paper he deals it the following black eye: We got aloug very well without Grant while he was going arouud the world, and we do not need him now. There are 1,000,000 citiiens of the United States as capable as he of being a good President for the fouryoais succeeding Hayes. Any capable Justice of the Peace is equal to tlie Chief Magistracy. The American people must not be per mitted to make asses of themselves about the noed of rulers. We do not require anybody to rule over us. We are Republicans and irule] ourselves. The President isn't a ruler. Alex. 11. Stephens deniee that he has expressed himself in favor of Grant. In a letter to the Augusta Chronicle he is in accord with the erratic Dr. Felton, or that he contemplates publishing a simi lar manifesto. He also denies saving to a reporter of the Washington star that "if democratic dimensions in New York continue our only hope of success is des troyed, and the South wi|l look out for herself," or that "the South to-day pre fers Grant as dictator to Sherman or Conklingas President," or that "among the Southern soldiery there is the great est respect and reverence for Grant, and that Lhepsopls of the South would sup* port him in preference to any other man of the republican party." Mr. Stephens says that the telegrams and interviews ascribing these expressions to him are groundless fabrications from beginning to end, and he trusts "that the people of Georgia who hare any regard for tbe truth will not bo misled as to my say ings or doings by giving credence to any such anonymous representations of my utterances." The heathen Japs have a highfalutin opinion of Grant, which is not less than the opinion of the jobbers and plunder* ers here, from whom they evidently re~ ceived their knowledge of the Gener al. In anticipation of the visit of General Grant to Jeddo there appeared a sketch of his life in Japanese, in which the author, after speaking with enthusiasm of the achievements of Gorantu, as he calls the General, addresses his readers in the following words"Whether we consider the fox amoDg leasts, or the pho. nix among birds, we find that even when endowed with unusual abilities the inte.'hgence of these is not equal to that of stupid Old women or doltish boys. But men are able, if Uiey chose, to culti vate their talents; and tifir >® ft man who has cultivated his great natural abilities, is rich in thought, is admirmb.'O in bis movements, is as unfathomable as heaven and earth, and with whom neither the fox nor the pbu-nix is for a moment to be compared. Sach a one is General Grant, whose intelligence is commanding to a degree, and whose business capacities are truly grand." Well, wc are to have light at last. And now it is announced that Edison promi ses to show his electric light perfected on Christmas evo, at Menlospark, N. J. He will illuminate all the buildings in the modest little hamlet in which he lives and works. To that end wires have been run from liouae to house, and connected thence with his laboratory. The illumination will be given by means of what might be railed electric jets, each jet of 10-candlo power, which is the measurement of electric intensity; that is to Bay the extraordinary phe nomenon may be seen, on Christmas day in Menlo-park, of electric lights toned down to the intensity of gas jets. In a few days Edison will begin the task of affixing the jets so-called, from thejgas burners in the Beveral houses, instead of running wires that are to transmit the current through gas pipes, as it is his intention to do shortlv, in this city. For this occasion ho will lay wires along the pipes. "I shall send in vitations far and wide," says Edison, "in order that all may see that what has considered as visionary and impos sible, ha® I**" aecompllslwfd. Let gas companies reduce their prha, and then reduce it again, for it la well known they can still do this and make money, and I can undersell them and make a largo profit.

MESSAGE. On Tuesday last President t llaycs I sent his third annual message to con*; press, and as it is a lengthy document we cannot publish it, and so notice the following from the Harrisbnrg l'i •' in reference to it: It contains nothing of a remarkable nature except an itera tion of the civil service reform recom* mendation made by Mr. Hayes in 1577 which so disgusted his party that it re fused to sustain the administration at the elections of that year. The fine hand of John Sherman is plainly visible in tliis part of the message. Now that the elections are over and the depart ment clerks will not be required to con tribute tojtho republican corruption fund for six months to come lie thinks it a good time to manufacture a little capita! for the administration and for himself as the administration candidate fur the succession. With this view he has per suaded his chief to drop the stalwarts once more and to return to a repetition of his mummery in regard to the civil service. On this point, however, the message carefully distinguishes between the heads of departments and their sub ordinates so as not to subject Mr. Sher man and his associates in the cabinet, or Mr. Hayes himself, to criticism or ridicule for their meddlesome interfer ence in recent political campaigns. It is insisted that the president and his of ficial advisers may with eminent propri ety explain their policy before the peo ple, but that it is the duty of those in subordinate places in the civil service "to obey tbe legal Instructions of those upon whotn that authority is devolved and their best public service consists in the discharge of their functions irre spective of partisan politics." In other words, while the president and his cabi net may properly travel over the coun try on electioneering tours and engage in partisan politics to the top of their bent, chiefs of bureaus and. department clerks must not meddle in political mat fers but give all their time and attention to their official duties. The message al-; so declares that "in whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for party purposes U]>on the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public service aud discreditable to the country." Now, the fact is, as Mr. Hayes and Mr.bherman very well know, that if the members of the cabinet and the president himself did not set the ox ample their subordinates would not trouble themselves abont partisan poli tics ; that if the high officials of the ad ministration did not permit levies to be made upon their underlings for party purposes and thus countenance and en courage that practice there would soon bean end of this system of collecting electioneering funds from the subordi nates in the departments. It is only necessary for Mr. Hayes to put his foot on the evils of which he complains if he would crush them out. Hut the course pursued by his cabinet, notably by the secretary of the treasury, is not calcu lated to inspire any very profound faith in his sincerity. It is notorious that subordinates in the departments aud of ficers of the revenue have been removed because they did not belong to the ad ministration party or failed to perceive the eminent fitness of John Sherman for the presidency. Nevertheless, it will be well for congress to take Mr. Hayes at'his word and send to him such legis lation for his approval as will not mere ly authorize but require the executive and heads of departments to cause their subordinates to abstain from such par ticipation in partisan politics as inter feres in any way with the proper dis charge (J their oflieial duties or requires ttiem to share their salaries with tlio managers of political campaigns. The message congratulates congress on the success of resumption, but falls into a contradiction when it reecommends the retirement of the legal tender notes; for if rcdpmptjpn is already a success, in spite of the fa iX that the whole of the $1540,000,000 of legal tenders repeln un redeemed, where is the necessity for the retirement of the legal tenders',' Mr. Hayes could not have more maladroitly admitted that resumption is not yet an assured fiif-i 4t?d will not ho until the le gal lenders urn finally redeemed at the treasury. On other subjects the message is very tame and unsuggeslivo. hcarcu lv a thread of the bloody shirt appears in its texture. An allusion is made to the importance of free elections, and a platitude about public opinion overrid ing "all political prejudices and all sec tional and state attachments in dernand- I tug that all ovci our wide leritorr lite name und character of citir.cn of the t'nitcd Stairs shall mean one and the same thing," probably in intended as a bint to congress to require Massachu setts and Rhode I -land to treat natural laod eltlsena of tins United States at least as well as Wisconsin and Minne aota treat unnaturalited foreigners. A* a whole the message is just what might have been cipeeled from an Ohio man who holds an office to which he was not eluctesl prompted by another Ohio man who hopes to to elected to an office which he fears the people are unwilling to confer upou hitu, orANIIIMi Of
