THURSDAY, DEC 14, 1905. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's annual message has been well received by the press and public generally. There can be but one objection urged to it, and that is its great length. But when one stops to consider that there were so many im? portant questions that had to be treated the length of the message must be ig? nored. Every question is discussed so frankly, ably and sincerely by the Presi? dent that the people will be likely to ap? prove his views on each subject he has treated in the message. The Democratic press is as earnest in praising the message as is the Republi? can. The Democrats can find but one objection and that is what the President said about the tariff. He makes no rec? ommendations on that question, and in so doing acts wisely. This is no time for agitating the tariff. If we were passing through or threatened with a business panic ; if labor was unemployed and agricultural, mining and ^.manufac? turing interests greatly depressed there might be some reason for the agitation of an economic question which greatly influences the business conditions of the country. But the United States is now enjoying one of its periods of almost unequaled prosperity, and Mr. Roose? velt has concluded that it would be fol? ly to make any change in the industrial policy of the government. The failure of the President to advo? cate what has been called tariff reform must be a great disappointment to the Democratic leaders. They have for some months been bolstering them? selves with the hope that he would de velope into a regular tariff ripper or smasher. It was thought by sanguine Democrats that Mr. Roosevelt would not only express decided views in favor of ultra tariff revision,but that he would try to force his opinions on Congress. Then it was thought would come the Democratic opportunity. It was un? derstood that the Democratic members of Congress would unite with those Re? publicans who favored tariff revision and back Mr. Roosevelt up as against a majority of the Republicans members. A very nice little scheme but too vis? ionary to have been born of real states menship. It about measures up to the leadership of the Democrats in the House of Representatives. John Sharp Williams has been and is now the leader of the Democracy in the House, and he hales from a State which L the lowest in the scale of progress of any in the Union. Mississippi has the greatest per centage of illiteracy of any of the States and in industrial enterprise is at the foot of the column. IS 

THIS DEMOCRACY? The old time Democracy, that of the Jeffersohian and Jacksonian type, was was radically opposed to anything that had the semblance of paternalism. It was strongly opposed to anything and everything that tended to impair the doctrine of States rights and advance the idea of centralization. But times have changed and Democ? racy has also changed. We now find the Democratic leaders, especially from the South, the most earnest advocates of Federal supervision of the railroads and other corporations, of insurance companies; .and many of them are for asking and taking appropriations from the Federal Government to aid in build? ing public highways. They are now the supporters of such policies as these and claim that they are Democratic policies. When did they become such? When did Democracy stand for pater? nalism? There are now eight hundred rural free delivery mail routes in operation in Virginia. About one hundred and fifty thousand persons are served by these eight hundred routes, and the ser? vice costs the government about a half million dollars. Most of this sum is paid to men who act as messengers or carriers. The Republican party has given this splendid service to the peo? ple and is extending it all the time. -4.a. m We have received several copies of the Daily Times which began publica? tion at Harrisonburg, Va., on the 1st inst. It is a bright, newsy sheet, of excellent mechanical appearance, and is Republican in politics. Mr. D. Shef fey Lewis, editor of the Spirit of the Valley, will have charge of the edito? rial department of the Times, which is a. guarantee that, the paper will be ed? ited with a ability. We welcome the Times among our exchanges, and hope it may be a successful venture.

United States Senator Mitchell, of Oregon, died at Portland on the 8th inst. The cause of his death was hemorra hage produced by four teeth extracted. Senator Mitchell had for some time been in disgrace on account of his con? nection with the land frauds of that State. Under the circumstances his death was a relief to himself and his friends. -?.? FORTUNE SEED. (Atlanta Journal.) A peny may seem to you a very insig? nificant thing. But it is the small seed from which fortunes spring. If you want to raise a flower you get the seed, plant it in the best soil avail? able and do all that you can to encour? age its growth. You may be fortunate enough to procure a half-growth plant, but some time, somewhere, somebody planted the seed. The penny is the seed of that wonder? ful growth which the best of us cannot help admiring and for which all of us more or less ardently long?the fortune plant. If you would have one of these plants your own. If you dream of sitting at ease under its branches in your old age, go about growing it in a rational way and in conformity with the fixed laws of nature. Treat the disc of copper?1 cent?with the respect that a fortune seed deserves. Nature ?3 the greatest of all teachers, but many of us fail to see the signifi? cance of the facts which are so quietly but so insistently placed before us. If one who has received a comfortable salary for five or ten years suddenly finds himself out of a position, with no money saved up, he is pretty sure to blame his "luck," instead of sensibly realizing that experience is putting be? fore him in the most convincing manner a lesson he needs to learn by heart. If, instead of bemoaning his "luck," he will listen he will hear a still, small voice whispering to him of pennies and nickels and dimes and dollars which have been not wisely sown, but scat? tered on the winds and wasted. Money spent in legitimate pleasure need never be regretted. Such indulg? ences bestow delightful memories that comfort even in the cruelest hardships. Suppose that at 20 one should make a vow to put away at least 5 cents a day and not touch his savings for ten years. From this investment, to small that he would scarcely miss it, he would have at 30 the sum of $182.50 to his credit. This is little? Yes; this is the small? est thing he has gained. He has learned to look upon his pen? nies as fortune seeds, and that lesson is worth far more than his nickel a day. He has acquired the habit of saving, which grows infinitely faster even than money at compound interest. The chances are that within a year he has made his savings a dime a day and within two years a quarter, that at 30 he has a thrifty fortune and at 40 a snug fortune. We hear of fortunes being made sud? denly and seemingly by magic. Yes; the other day in Wall street eight mill? ions were made in five minutes in a deal in cotton. But don't be deceived. Ordinarily, fortunes are not made in this way. For one such there are thousands that grow like the plant, day by day, from little seeds of savings. ??.? THE MASCULINE IN RELIGION. (Philadelphia Press.) The newest note in the church life of America, next to aggressive evangel? ism, is the emphasis that is being placed upon the masculine in religion. Almost unchallenged the impression has prevailed among people generally that women and children hold a mort? gage upon religious activities. The churches, it has been thought, paradox? ically, have- been manned by women. The latter undoubtedly form the larger portion of the average congregation. They raise money, do the work and dominate the life of the churches. Of late this order has shown decided signs of change. The Young Men's Christian Association half a century ago did much to shatter it with respect to more general religious activities; and it continues, with increasing effectiveness, to give Christianity caste among the world's men. The development now be? ing considered, however, has to do strictly with the work of men in the lo? cal congregation or denomination, as il? lustrated by the mass meeting which the Presbyterian men of Philadelphia held one evening this week. Most conspicuous among the churches in which the male element is conscious of its identity and power is the Protest | ant Episcopal, whose Brotherhood of St. i Andrew has done mighty works in de ! veloping men's activity for men along 1 religious lines and in aligning men in all ; walks of life with specifically Christian | effort. The kindred Brotherhood of An i drew and Philip, to be found in several denominations, is likewise strong and growing. The Presbyterians are at work upon the erection of an organized form and fellowship for the men of that name. A tendency toward .similar ac? tion in other ecclesiastical bodies may , easily be discerned. Already the Ro ? man Catholic church has federated into I one cohesive body the numerous and di j verse societies of men within its par , ishes. If the men of the churches are to take hold of religion, as these signs would seem to indicate, and press its interests as they press the present day commer? cial enterprises which they direct, we may look for extraordinary develop? ments in church life and in the attitude of society in general toward the latter. With a skilled and devoted force of lay workers, permeating every department of human activity, the Church need be less concerned than she now is over the dearth of candidates for the ministry. AN 

ELASTIC CURRENCY. (Philadelphia Press.) Secretary Shaw urges in his annual report the one plan proved safe, ade? quate and efficient to provide new bank currency when business requires more currency. Following the German plan he pro? poses that national banks have the au? thority to issue one-half more than their secured currency; but pay 5 per cent, a year tax on this issue. The result will be that when the rate for loans is low, below 5 per cent., none of these notes will be issued. There will be no profit to them. But when business expands loans are in demand and the rate of money rises to 12 per cent, in New York, as it did last summer, or to 14 per cent., as it has been recently, these notes will be issued to secure this profit. They will ease the strain on credits and prevent a stringency in bank loans at the financial center of the country. This is no theory. The plan has been tried in Germany for twenty-four years, since the Bank of Germany was given this power. In quiet years these notes are never issued. Let a strain come and they appear. In September, 1897, $51,000,000 were issued on tbis plan; in September, 1898, $69,000,000. in September, 1899, $92, 500,000, and in September, 1900, $70, 000,000. These were all periods of vast liquidation, owning to the fall in Ger? man industrials. This year $70,000,000 of these notes were at one time issued. When the stress is passed they disap? pear and are retired in a day to save the tax. So they would here. Secretary Shaw's recommendation would give not only a currency elastic and expanding as needed, automatically, but it would give this expansion legally, instead of outside of the law and with no legal sanction by the issue of New York Clearing House certificates. Congress should enact Secretary Shaw's recommendation without delay. If it does not we shall continue to see the perilous rise of the rate for interest when a stress comes. AN AMERICAN WESTMINSTER ABBEY. (New York Sun.) Every subject of Great Britain hopes his services to his country will entitle him to a tomb in Westminster Abbey. We could offer a similar ambition to our people if Congress would build a suita? ble memorial building in Washington and move the remains of every man who has been President of the United States, and bury them in this building, and erect a suitable tomb over each. Ten years after the death of every very prominent man, require the Sen? ate of the United States to meet in se? cret session and carefully examine the record of his services. If the Senate decided that he was entitled to a place in this building his heirs should be in? formed officially that they are author? ized to erect a tomb to his memory in the memorial building. There are hundreds of people buried in Westminster Abbey who gave no service to their country, and were not prominent officially, politically, or in any way. In ours, on the contrary, Presidents of the United States would be buried, and the only other tombs would be of men whom the Senate had decided (ten years after their deaths) to be entitled to be so honored. Possibly in time men would prefer ours to Westminster. The Presidents belong to the whole United States, and their bodies should be taken care of forever in a dignified and proper way by Congress. The private begging that has been going on for the last hundred years to build, repair, and keep in order the tombs of ex-Presidents is undignified and unworthy of a great nation. ?a ?a. 

NIAGARA AND "COMMERCIALISM." (Brooklyn Eagle.) A public spirited citizen of Iowa, who is petitioning the powers to prevent the destruction of Niagara Falls by the electrical power companies, asks if it would not be a disgrace to our country "to see such a grand piece of Nature's work destroyed in such a manner?" It would. But we care less about the man? ner than the result. Whether the falls are to be ruined by the corporations who are now at work upon them, or by mill owners, or cannai diggers, or by any people, whomsoever, the fact of their impending ruin should be enough to bring every American to his feet in pro? test?every real American, we mean, for there are some among us to whom the dollar is larger than the country, and it is men of the lower commercial instincts who seek the devastation of Niagara in the interest of their own pockets all the time. We can spare such men better than we can spare the Niagara Falls. ?a.? Dying of Famine is, in its torments, like dying of consump? tion.

Globe.) Our old but unwelcome friend, the grip, has arrived in London, and may soon be expected in New York aboard one of the Atlantic liners. He or she, according to one's point of view on the woman question (only the female mos? quito bites), has adopted a new disguise in the shape of facial neuralgia. This grevious mask, happily named by the French the ' 'dolorous habit, ' ' is said to be a marked characteristic of the pres? ent London cases. It adds considerably to the patient's sufferings, but is apparently less fatal than the so-called rheumatic influenza, which type characterized some of the earlier epidemics. The London experts who predict that the disease is on the wane, and that after a year or two epi? demics will disappear entirely until a new generation has grown up for it to feed upon, know, it is to be hoped, whereof they speak. The fact, however, that many per? sons suffer from repeated attacks year after year seems to indicate that grip is not a malady in which immunity can be depended upon after the first infection. PICKLED POSTS AND POLES. (Kansas City Journal.) "Preservation of wood is becoming more general every year," said Mr. 0. Chanute, who has put in a number of railroad tie pickling plants throughout the country. They are even extending this pickling business to fence posts and telegraph and telephone poles. It works out well in both of these. In the pickling of ties, the railroads are using a great many of the softer woods, those which ordinari? ly wouldn't last more than two or three years. By the treatment of chemicals, though, their life is extended to at least ten years. The movement first had its origin about 1880, when attention was called by the government that there was be? coming a scarcity of timber in various sections of the country. THE UTILE FOOL. (Baltimore Herald.) Holding by long tradition to the lov? ing appellation "The Little Father" in referring to the czar, it is highly signif? icant of the embitterred feeling of the populace that they are now freely speaking of him as the little fool. Such a change in sentiment denotes the depth of popular fueling against the man whom the Russian people hold charge? able with their ills and whom they ac? cuse of bad faith in not putting into ef? fect his promised reforms. It is just such straws as the uncom? plimentary alliteration that show the direction in which the wind is blowing and the rising force of the popular storm in the Russian empire. -a.?
