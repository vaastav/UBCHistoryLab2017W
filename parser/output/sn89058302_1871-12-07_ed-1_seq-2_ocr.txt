THE ENTEKP1USE. Swwtwatcr, Thursday, Dec. 7.1871. To Onr Fanner Frlouds. W Lbtu rectivol a coinumiiicntion from a citizcu of this county, mldi-eiod to the fanners, on the subject of tolmrco raining. He tmggeuts the propriety ef mining more tobacco. Our climate nud oil in deeined, in all rc.iiieota, fuvorulde, and produces a fair crop. New, tobac co in canh, snU cau be hauled to tbe de pots, to be shipped to market, when coru, wheat, onttt, rye and potatoes, can not Stock can be mixed to coumuue these productions, and go out ou the hoof. A change in our production ix essential for the prosperity of our coun try. The oft repeated auswer to inqui ries of neighbors: "How is all how is your crop ?" "Well, in the Providence of Ood, I will have enough to do us." Now this is played out it wants something more it wants a mirplun, mid we must not be content without something for eickut'KS and misfortunes. Corn will not pay at fifty, nor lmys at four cents. Lot us get np a new staple. Let us get the Collin's and Excelnior Plow?, with aub-soilers, some fertilizers mid a system of water-level cultivation fur our rolling lands, with extended under-drainnge, and myword forit, East Tennessee lands will pay better than evtr heretofore, and wo will hearfio more about going West to die the sooner or shake your liver out. The suggestions of our correspondent, would no doubt be of great bunetit to the lunds, aud a decided benefit to the farmers of East Tennessee. We ask our farmer friends to give the matter their attention. The Demand for Iron. The amount of railroad building go ing on in America, is altogether unprece dented, and the consequent demand for iron is very grout. Even if no new lines were building, the mere renewal of road way aud rolling stock for 53,000 miles of railroad would require an enormous mount of iron. Then we have a tre mendous increase of demand for iron for machinery in manufactures and for implements in agriculture and the ordi nary arts. If we tako agriculture alone, and look at the immense anuual increase of tillage, and calculate the regular de mand fdr agricultural implements, we hall see that this item is of great inter est to the iron trade. But in addition to this we have commenced the con struction of iron steamships, tug.", bar ges and sailing vessels and iron petro leum cans and tanks; and the number of iron coal cars demanded increases rapidly; we aro also using inm in build ing to an unusual extent. In fact, iron was never before in anything like the demand in America that it is now. Intrigues. Somo tricky work is on foot between Mr. Blaine, Speaker of the House of Kopresentativo and Ben. Butler. But lur'a object is revengo against Sumner aud Wilson for kicking him out of the Governorship of MuasachuiiettR; aud he wants the committee so arranged that he cau have the formation of parties. But the other rc'iuiuo of which Mr. Blaiuo is accused, is that ho is willing and anxior.3 to nell the Committee of Ways and Means to tho tariff men of Pensylvania. Tho country will not, however, look on calmly and see their great aud general interests sarriliced to monopolists. Mr. Blaine is a candidate for tho Pres idency, and wants the electoral vole of Pennsylvania and her aid in the nomina ting convention. Tariff. What the country doraands is a tariff for tho support of Government and out laying obligations; not a tariff that crushes out industry and absorbs profits. A tariff that will produce $141,000,001) is enough, and then we can have a free list upon articles that never should have been subjected to a dime of duty. It is high time that tho country was relieved of its great incubus of an ad ministration, and a ruling party which uses the tariff merely as a means of pay ing off tho publiu debt at once, when there is no need to do so, unless it is that they may boast of having got the nation oi.t of Cebi. In doing so, speedi ly as they propose, they will leave the people starving and in rags, The Reform Tarty. It is all important that the Reform party should orgauizo at once. There ii not a moment to spare. It must be thorough aud complete in all its parts. If the subject is not perfected immedi ately tho Republicans will seize tho op portunity, and dropping Graut and his corrupt gang, will carry the elections by clamor for retrenchment and honesty in the dischargd of the public service. It was tho Democratic party which be gan the war ou the corruptions of Tam many, and they havo all the honor of that victory. The Late President Lincoln's Bed. The bed on which the assassinated President died was sold the other day by public auction for eighty dollars. A restaurant keeper was the purchaser, and intends to keep this rclio of the great tragedy at Ford's theatre. The family in whose possession it was were so annoyed by visitors constantly call ing to Bee the room and furniture, that they were obliged to get rid of both, by leasing the house and selling the furni ture. ! i . - "Can Men Fly 1" An exchango heads an abstruse arti cle, "Can Men Fly ?"

Nelsou, bus resigned his seat ou tho Supreme Bene h of i'euues seo, which took tiled on Tuesday. The Governor has appointed Hou. J.uues T. Shields, of Graiugur county, to rill the vacancy, until tho election in 'August next. The people all over the St Uu will no doubt regret to karu that Thomas A. B. Nelson, is no more to preside as one of our Supreme Judges. "When, in 1870, the people were called upon to se lect six of their most eminent juri.-.t to couatituto a Supreme Court, the first of their choice since the war, there was a guiiend desire ex; l ushed by the Conser vatives iu all of the three grand divisions of the State, thut T. A. It. Nelson should be out) of the two Judges to bB choion from East Teuiussco. They recognized in Judge Nelson one of Teuneste's no blest sons, and his election, by a majori ty of over One Hundred Thousand, gave evidence of their trust aud confidence in him. Judge Nelson's course while on the Supreme Beuch, has fully justified the unmeasured confidence which the peo ple reposed iu his eminent learning, purity of character and spotless integri ty. Tho prominence of his nalie gifts, his rich and varied experience, and un varied diguity combined with winning courtesy, won him the love and admira tion of his associates and the unbounded respect of all. Judgo Nelson is, indeed, "oue of Uiu race of intellectual giants," eminent aliko as a jurist .iiul a statesman. Wo but express the unanimous rctfi'tt of our citizens in all parts of the State, at the retirement of oue who has so emi nently adorned tho Supreme Bench, and rendered such signal service to the State. Judge Shields, who has been appoint ed by tho Governor, to till tho vacancy iu the Supreme Bench, is well and favor ably known in East Teutiessee, as a law yer and a jurist, lie has, at times, ac ted as special Judge of the Supreme Court, aud has ever wore the ermine gracefully. Of vigorous intellect, great and varied learning, incorruptible integ rity, aud underlying all these, a sound common sense, Judge Shields wili adorn the Bench and cannot fail to favorably impress the bar and the people of the Statu with whom he is not now familar." doil Hates a Coward. Pomeroy's Now Yoik Democrat, speak ing of tho recent Democratic defeat, aj s, numerous aro the excuses made by dif ferent Democartio editors in trying to account for the defeat of the Democracy of New York in 1871. But few of them havo come even within range of the centre when shoot ing at tho unfortunate target. Brietly, these are tlio reasons: Tho Democratic convention at Rochester dared not nidu with the right. Dared not admit honest dele g iie-i or turn out dishonest ones. This killed tho State ticket, as wo propiic- cied from the hrst. The Democracy of tho comity under took to carry a stinking, rotten and rot toning load of Tammany records, nud to force honest people to endorse dis honesty. Democracy is in ;t the protec tion ef thieves. Delegates to the Hoche'i tet convention thought otherwise the majority disagreed with them; thus the defeat. Had tho Rochester Coiiventiou Formally expelled Tammany; Cordially admitted tho Reformers; Aakml honest men to put down all corruption; Denounced the corruptions of Taiu inauy aa undemocratic and demanded huiifsl'i and pnilivlii.ii if the pi'ojilr, we could now point to aDoinocratie State, instead of a Republican one. "Great oaks from littlu acorns grow." Let us look to the past. To tho Baltimore convention, the year General Taylor was elected Prei dent, there went from New York two sets of delegates Tammany and Anti Tammany. That convention of Demo crats ruled out both delegations from this State. It then nominated Lewis W. Cass for the Presidency. Ex-Mayor Havemeyer of this city ono of those noble men whose lives glori fy God was a raled-out Democratic delegate to thut convention. After the nominations he made a speech to all the New York delegates who were not admitted, and suggested tho falling of a convei.t'ou in New York, to take the sense of tlio people, and see if New York poposed to stand by the work of a convention from whose deliberations New York Slate was excluded. The rejected delegates took up the idea. Iu the office of John Van Buren resolutions were drawn up, suggesting thut as Now York had no voice in the National Convention, she had a voice of her men, and could vote -for the man who was her fovorite. Tho vote of New York was cast for Martin Van Buren. It was thereby lost for Cass. 2'ho result was the elec tion of Taylor, and a change of adminis tration resulting from the lack of pluck on the part of tlio delegates to the Baltimore Convention as this State was lost to tho Democracy iu 1871 through the cowardice of the Rochester Ciuveution. After Them Stronglj. The New York Daily Advertiser gives tho following from an address delivered roceutly in New Jersy by a Catholic Priest, which will coiumoud itself at once to every friend of total abstinence: "Tho Rev. Father Honnessy, pastor of St. Patrick's Church, Borgen City, deliv ered a terrible aud bitter sermon ou Sun day last, levelling his thunderbolt against tho gin-mill keepers, and the arthurwarm and indifferent Catholics of his mission. During his discourse he said, "I aui going to get a list of all grog-shops and gin place proprietors, and if they don't close their houses every Saturday night at twelve o'clock, and not open them until Monday, I will not allow themselves, nor their wives to come near this aitar. They must give up their unholy work. Let them bo content with selling gro ceries." It is better to make fiity cents a day honestly and justly, with the bless ing of God upon it, than ten dollars a d ly with the curso of God npou it. Remember that the money -gained in thio dirty work will not profit you long. It, will vanish liko tha froth on. the river. You are eurryhig souls to deutruetioc aud ruin ; you i.ro robbing the widow iiuu fiio i ;phau, the poor and tho needy. Ct -m ct.i. s j our ttoik then, and resolve to get an huut.it and decent living." Organization of Congress. Tho United States Congress was or ga.iizti on Monday last. Tho Senate met at Id o'clock, a quo rum being present, a committee was tip poiuted to notify the President. The Mes sage not having been received at 1 o'clock, the Senate took a recess for half an hour.

A bill has passed the Georgia Senate providing a method for instituting pros ecutions for the purpose of recovering money or property stolen or fraudulently or unlawfully converted from the State or the Western and Atlantic Railroad. This bill provides that such property may be recovered from any persons or corporation into whose possession it may be traced by competent proof, by a pro ceeding filed by the Solicitor General upon tlio information of any citizen; and Unit all proceedings under this act shall bo in tho name of the State of Georgia. Tho fourth section of the bill proclaims that Uie passage shall be deemed a no tice to all tho world of the claim of tho State to any money or property liable under tho same now held or owned by any person who has held au office or any position under the State or the Western and Atlantic Railroad since July 1, 18(iu or may be now or hereafter in such offi ce or position. And to show that the frnmers of this bill me an business, it is provided in the tenth section that when ever any person, after having begun or caused to bo begun any suit under this act, for the recovery of money or prop erty belonging to the State, or the State Road, shall presume to settle or compro mise tho samo without the cemsent or written order of the Judgo, he shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and ou con viction thereof shall be punished by im prisonment in the penitentiary for a term not less than one nor longer than five years. Tho New York Sun says, "This bill, as will bo seen, affords a means for re covering the railroad property fraudu lently transferred to the Delano and Cameron Ring, as well as for forcing the Bullock and Blodget conspirators to dis gorge their stealings, if any property be longing to the latter can be found. It will doubtless become a law, and unless Graut hurries up with his proclamation of martial lew his friends may yet see their ill-gotten spoil vanish from thoir sight like the mist of the morning be foro the efulgent rays of the sun."

Editor EmtEkpri-e : Considerable Lcgislatiiiii bus heeu gone through with since my last. The most important meas ure that ban been before the Oeueral As sembly ting week, was tbe bill fur the re peal of the ten percent, interest law, Tbe hill was lost and tbe law stands aa before. Its friends arjjued that, to let the law re main at ten per cent, it would bring into our 8tatn thousand!) of dollars to bu loan cel. 1 doubt the argument and think tlio law should hava beeu repealed. Neariy the entire East Tennessee dnl"gitiou voted for its repeal iu both Houen. A resolution to adjourn no tbe 15lliand one to adjourn on the 20th., were both defeated iu the Seuute on Friday. Tbe revenue bill and the one to re-district the Stuta for Legislative members, are the only two important bills, now be fore us that the whole people are inter ested iu. And there is some talk ef post poning tha bill until the extra se.-siou of tbe Legislature to re-district tho State fur Congressional Districts. A bill bus pas ed the House to ullow parties defendants in certain actions and to have llin cause us to themselves trans ferred to tbe comities of their residence. Tbe time of holding your Chancery Court's hus been changed to uit bis Hon. or Judge Key, to the third Monday's in February and August. -1 uuderstund some of the Lawyers, are not ye satisfied as to the time of holding the courts. If all interested will let your members know what time will suit them, and all will agree, they will certuinly fix the time sat isfactorily. An impnrtan bill in regard to tho titles of land sold for taxes, hag passed which will cause u'l such sales to bo perfeo ed, and tho State will bo much benefitted by it. Titles will be perfected iu the Chan cery Courts. Your Senator "proposed an amendment to. retain such proceedings in tbe Cireuit Court, where the laud is first condemned, which was voted do in by a small majority. There is too much dis position to give Chancery Courts control of all rpicstious that conio up. Tlio feeling tnioug our people is stron ger, against theone man power, than here tofore, since King Grant sets upon his throne in Washington issueing bis procla mations, placing Southern States under marshal law, and tilling Southern jails full of our best citizens who aro innocent of any crime whatever. Kcpuhlicun liberty is almost gone iu these glorious United States of ours. Yours, truly, Cumberland Synopsis ol the President's Message. Tlio lollowing is a synopsis of the President's Annual Mt.'suge, to Congress, rend in both Houses, on Monday last : Tho President states that the relation? of the United Statu with l'urein powers continue friendly., He refers to tlit settlement of the At ahama dispute by the treaty of Washington, and sn)8 that the example thus bet may he followed by ether civilized nations, and finally by the menns of returning- to productive industry mil lions of hub who are now retained to scttlo na tional disputes hy tho bayonet and broadside. He commends tho Miuistor and Consuls in France for their coiuve in protecting the inter est of fierroa'i eul jeets in 'aria during the war. He informs Congress tbat, in conformity with the estaldished precedent, he has recognized the change of government in Home and the Italian flutes. He epenkg of the continued friendly re lations hetwean Rusaia and the United States, referring to the visit of the Grand Duke Alexis, nn-t to the cordial reception given to him. Relatititf to the Cataenzy Question, the Presi dent Buys that the ir excusable course of the ft lis sinn .Minister had rendered it necessary forthe President to ask the Minister's recall and to de cline to receive tbat functionary any lunger. He says that it was imp' scilile tor him, with sell respect, or with a just regard to the dignity of the nation to permit Mr. Cataenzy to continue to hold intercourse with this Government after his personal abuse of a Government oltiuinl and after his improper interference by variant means in the relations between this co-intiy and other powers. The Government hail therefore been leleufedfrom further intercourse with Jr.Cata ciuv, and another Minister has been commis sioned who wag efTTircly unobjectionable. He gives th history of the dilliculty iu Corea and leaves the subject to tlio action of Congress. As to Cuban ntlairs, he says that ho has in structed the American Naval Comthamlers iu Cuban waters to protect ,,tlio lives and lib erties of bonafide citizens of tho Ueited States and the dignity of the mig, and expresses the hope that all pending questions between the United itates and Cuba may be adjusted iu the spirit of peace and conciliation which has here tofore guided both powers. He recon mends Congress to take measures to support the lines of steamships betwecu San Francisco and China, and San Francisco and Ja pan, Yio to take steps to brin; about a return to specie payment. Also, to unite tho telegra pliio system with the postal system of the Uni ted States. Ho defends the policy pursued in reference to thestoppnge of Ku-klux, outrages and expresses the belief that out of the very numerous arrests made no innocent person arc now in custody. In repaid to polygamy in btah, he relates the action ol the Federal Cuurts, and authorities there, and says that the Moi mens will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religiun, but suggests whether the children al ready noi n nmler the Mormon system should not be legitimatized. Hj recommends the aboltion of all internal revenue taxes excepts those on spirits, malt liquors, tobacco and stamps. He says that the Indian peace policy has thus far resulted favorably, and he recommends the toimaiionof a territorial government in the In dian territory. He suggests the removal of all political disa bilities under the Fourteenth Constitutional Amendment, and says that it will be a happy day tor the bouthei u Slules when the old citi zens shall again take au interest ip public af fairs. tie recommends liberal appropriations for tiie District of Columbia unit lor public buildings in Chicago. He reviews the questions of Civil Ser vice R 'loi ui ami promises that the experiments of reform shall huve a fair trial. Washington News.

The total receipts from tobacco are thirty-three and a hidf millions; increase, two aud a quarter millions; total yield of tobacco, nearly oue hundred and six million pounds, whereof ten aud a half million pounds have been exported. The number of cigars, cheroots, etc., upon which tax has been collected, is one thousand three hundred, and thirty two millions. The continuance of tho present system of stamps is recommended : A uniform tax of thirty-two cents per pound was recommended, in, A Bpeciid tax on peddlers, of from fif teen to fifty dollars, and increasing with the number of animals used by peddlers, was recommended; also, a special tax of five hundred dollars upon persons who soli raw or leaf lolacco to othors than ! tuose who have p lid tho special tax or who sludl sell the leaf tobacco m tpiauti tics leoss than twenty-five pounds. This would protect the lu.umfucturei' and in crease the revenue. Tho i lioiition of the present system of expeu ts nud bonded warehouses was suggested in the interest of manufac turers and the Government Drawbacks to be allowed upon proof that the goods had been landed abroad; loss at sea also entitling the shipper to drawbacks. The Government has gained three thousand ono hundred nud eighty-two, and lost four hundred and fifty-six revenue suits.
