Since tax paying time has commenced a large number of our subscribers have taken tho occasion to call in and square up old accounts and renew their subscriptions.

We thank these friends for their remembrance of the print er, aud we hope that others may emulate their example. J55? The Legislative Committeo selectsd last winter to write a new set of rules for governing the House, is reported as complet ing their work. The committee has increased the number of rules from seventy to ninety seven. Many changes have been made in the existing rules, although but few of a radical nature. Many rules which had become such by custom only, and which, at times, caused much discussion, have been incorporated in the proposed rules, thus making them clear beyond a doubt. ligP Our attention has been called again to the vast amount of manufactured stuff that is being put upon the market by the Peni tentiary contractors. The disastrous charac ter of the competition between convict and free labor becomes more apparent every day. And we therefore feel justified in again urg ing our suggestion with reference . to the lessening of this competition by the reduc tion of the number of convicts employed in any one line of industry. In the limitation of the number of prisoners in any one line of manufacture to such a number as will not bring about any appreciable or serious com petition with free labor in that same line we see the only solution of this momentous problem. Columbus Dispatch. Had the law which a Democratic Legisla ture enacted been kept in force by the Re publicans when they came into power, the people of the State would have been far bet ter off, even if the Penitentiary would not have been selfsustaining under its provisions. The Democratic party is the true friend of labor. The Republican party is continually legislating in the interests of capital and monopoly. J3" The expenses of keeping up the canals of Ohio was mpre than their income the past year, and this fact will probably be URcd a;nin as an argument for their abandonment. It is undoubtedly true that a portion of the canal system of Ohio is unfirofl table and cf no further account to the State or people, but the Legislature should carefully guard the interests of the productive portions. The up per end of the Ohio canal is valuable and the Miami & Erie has been and is of great service to the western tier of Ohio counties es pecially is this true from St. Mary's reser voir south to Cincinnati. The Miami St, Erie canal never failed to be self-supporting. The fact that the canal counties of the State, though few in number, pays more than one half the taxes of the State, is good argument for their maintenance. The water ways of Ohio are valuable and should not be aban doned. Toledo Bee. J3f The Cincinnati Enquirer, a few days since, published a sensational article stating that the sixteen Democratic members of the Senate will absent themselves from the ap proaching session in consequence of the revolutionary performances of the Republi cans lust winterfivhom they propose leavii g alone, so the story goes, to shape matters to suit themselves, as they will do in any evur, and make them wholly responsible for tl e legislation of the session. It is to bo hoped, at least for the sake of the Democratic party, that these sixteen gentlemen will refia-n from doing anything so utterly pueril as this. No good can possibly result from it, while much harm would. They were elected to re present the interests of as many constituen cies which would necessarily be entirely un represented, and consequently neglected, should tho proposed oourse of action be pur sued. But we place no confidence in the rumor, but believe when the Legislature meets on the 4th of January the Democratic Senators will be in their seats. Senator Groschner is already shaping his business matters to be present at the opening of the Legislature. TZg" The Dabney case lias finally reached the proportions of n national joke. A young man of strict integrity, admirable habits and unquestioned professional ability was given an appointment as Pension Examiner, with a trifling little salary. At once tho Republi can organs discovered that he had been a guard at Andersonville Prison; that he had kept watch on the "dead line;" that he had, with his own hand, shot Union soldiers; and in short, that he was personally responsible for all of the horrors attaching, and inevitably attaching, to a war prison in a community which can not even feed its soldiers in the field. In this connection the aforesaid organs avail ad themselves for this grand opportunity to disinter the Bloody Shirt from the grave in which it had so long rotted. They waved it with "ghoulish" glee. They printed whole pages of Andersonville history. They indig nated and they resoluted, and they raised Sheol generally, and now it appears that poor Tinlmev was born in 1600; that he was only fourteen years old when the war ended; that he never was in any war ol any kind; that be never was at Andersonville in this life, and not in any other that he knows of; and that he is, altogether, a pretty good sort of a fel low. It is a very funny history. A'noii irer. f Communicated.! About Time. The creditors of the late firm of Sheffield & Norton dispairing of receiving any honest treatment from those now interested with the management ( ?) of affairs, have filed a mo tion for the removal of Mrs. Sheffield as ad ministratrix of the estate of her deceased husband. The propriety of this application is to ns, and will be to all intelligent people, very apparent and the action of the Probate Judgo will no doubt be looked forward to with very great anxiety and interest Mrs. Sheffield was appointed administratrix some three years age and, though the assets were sufficient to meet at least 75 per cent, of the liabilities, the creditors have received but 2." per cent, of their claims. For this negligence and delay there can be no reasonable ercu.-e. That there has been gross mismanagement, not to say fraud and dishonesty, must from this state of facts necessarily be presumed, but we do not believe Judge Meekison is in any . way to blame. His conduct has always been that of an upright and able judge, and we do not know of a person to whom he ever denied justice. Mrs. Sheffield made application for appointment and as there were no objections raised by interested parties. Judge Meekison issued an order to that effect. That the administratrix, through incompetency or otherwise, has abused the trust reposed in her, there can be no possible doubt, and the creditors convinced that Mrs. Sheffield is not the proper person to be longer continued in that position, has made appli cation for her removal. Justice will do done the creditors and we have no doubt bat that their motion will be sustained. Not a Harvest. A well posted Indiana editor, after reciting the losses a newspaper sustains through activity in politics, says very accuiately: Is it any wonder, under such circumstances, that the impression that prevails that a poli tical campaign is "a harvest" for the pub lisher of a newspaper, becomes almost offen sive when expressed in the presence of one who knows the facts to be so entirely dif ferent? This loss of patronage, brought about, it must be remembered, in fighting for the party to which the journal belongs, is often almost invariably, indeed greater than the amount of work performed and paid for by the party during a campaign. Besides this class of work must of necessity be done as soon as ordered. No matter what im portant job may be on the presses at the time, nor how valuable it may be to the pub lisher, it must be laid aside at once, and the political work attended to. The day is fixed for a political meeting, and the speaker's name at hand; consequently the chairman of the central committee must have it announc ed. The day and date will not wait the print er's convenience. It is imperative that the work must be done, and at once. Many times in years past have we lost good paying cash jobs for the reason that the political printing must be done, and that of private parties deferred for a time, at least. We refer to these things in order todisabuse the minds of those who refer to a political campaign as a "printer's harvest." The facts are that when his labor for the party is taken into consideration; the losses of patronage he invariably sustains, brought about by fearlessly and emphatically asserting his views on public questions, and many othor things that could be mentioned, the publisher of a political country journal is the poorest paid man for the amount of labor done, of any other "on the foot-stool." It is for these reasons, then, that the better informed people of the country should sus tain the publisher of the home paper more unanimously than they have done. The public should bear in mind that his work for his party never ceases, but, like Tennyson's river, it "goes on, and on forever." An elec tion is scarcely held before he has donned the harress for the next campaign, and it is for this unceasing work work done when all others voters, speakers and public men are taking a rest, that he should be remembered; his services acknowledged, his labor paid for by a generous patronage from those in whose interest he has toiled. Especially should the successful candidate if a member of his party bear his labors in mind. To con clude, we may add that there is no "harvest" for the publisher of a country political journal, save in the consciousness of labor well performed. I3T The profits realized upon American manufactured products tell the story of the oppression both of productive and consump tive labor. The Government protects manu facturing capital in demanding a profit averaging 40 per cent, upon the products of the labor it employs, to start on; after this thera are cumulative profits which bring up the prices of said products to double or thrib ble the sum paid to the labor that produces them. Now, if these products are really worth what consumptive labor must pay for them, it follows that the labor which produc ed them has been defauded of its just dues. On the other hand, if these products are not worth the prices which consumers must pay for them, then it follows that consumptive labor is imposed upon and oppressed. The question which arises out of this condition of things is, why should capital be aided by the protective policy of the Government, in the gross injustice of realizing from one hun dred t three hundrad per cent, of profit upon the creations of productive labor, at the ex penso of consumptive labor? And while universal labor is thus compelled to pay $1.50 for what is in fact only worth from 50 cents to 75 cents, we hear the pitiful com plaint of capital that the American silver dollar is only worth 79 cents! This com plaint, unlike that we file for labor in this article, is not warranted by the facts in the case. The said silver dollar, by the highest authority on the faceof the earth (tho Consti tution of the United States of America,) is guaranteed to be of the value of one hundred cents, and to be the equal of the gold dollar in all transactions of business and trade, and for all money obligations whatsoever. It is therefore as honest a dollar as ever was coin nil, while the protective tariff system, which protects capital and oppresses labor, and which is palmed upon the country in the name of protection to industry, is the most gigantio scheme of dishonesty ever devised by the greea Ol man. acujonmine nxamm Nervous, Debilitated Men, You are allowed a free trial of thirty days of k nun T Ibn'a Hulnhr Aterl Vnltnin Belt. with Electric Suspensory Appliances, for the speeay reuoi ana permnneui. cure vi norvuun TYaK.iifn J.ioa nt vifnlittj unA Manhood, and Muni.J , uw. .

The ahadra of night cam drooping down, And wrapped in darkness nil the town; No ray of Hi;hl tar here and then The gllm'rinz of om distant star ; Or streaming ont upon the night Beam from some muac-wireacandla light. Such was Iba night and aacu the Unia, When donkey four marched In a line; Four donkey wise beyond a doubt. Moving apace with but one thought, They toward the town hall bent their way. To meet the foe in stcarn array, Heeolved lo SL'hl 'gainst temp'rancc laws, Aud win the day for whiskey 'a mire. Aud when they reached this place uf meeting And gave to all accustomed greeting, They alt them down, each face t face, Locked their long eara In fond embrace, And poured Into each others ear Their notea prolonged terrific clear; While those without who beard the aound, And felt tta thuudir ahake the ground, Remembered Charleston's recent ahake, And cried alas ! the earth dnth quake 1 At length the spokesman of the four Stretched 111" Iocs limbs ald took the floor; Oucc more the awful stillness broke, Opened hi mouth andthua he apokc: 'Dear brother donkey, we are here To put aside all shame or fear. And act the part of donkeys still. Who know full well their master's will. The time una come wo cant dei yo When we must atop this temperauce cry, Or else whiskey hoscs will Suffer defeat aud meet with ill. And atearn misfortune's lowering frown Will rest npon our little town ; The grape wlthlu our atreeis will grow, And trade to other towua will flow, While we who like a glase of beer, Or whiskey strong our hearts to cheer, Must quench our thirst na we are told With temperance people's water cold; We know they voted two to one Against the festive gay enloon. But what care we for tho people's choice, Or what care we for the people' voice ; The people's voire ia the voice of Qod, But we obey King Whiskey's nod. Prince Tyro, too, who wellils the listi, And for the Northwest mixes hash; Who ia no crazy temperance crank ; Ile'U sink his rowel in our flank. And make us jump aud snort with pain, If we refuse to mine the rein. Iu view of all these facts, I say, There is now one, and but one way, To beat all localoption laws, And thus advance our masters cause; As donkeys four we're fnily able To lay this ordinance ou the table, Where it may lay 'til crack of doom, Or longer still if there is room. We'll never take It up again." The other three all snld amen. And this Is how a I am told. In times long past four donkeys bold, Like heroes brave of great renow n, From prohibition saved the town.

The unprecedented sale of Boschee's Ger man Syrup within a few years, has astonish ed the world. It is without doubt the safest and best remedy ever discovered for the speedy and effectual cure of Coughs, Colds and the severest Lung troubles. It acts on an entirely different principle from the usual prescriptions given by Physicians, as it does not dry up a Cough and leave the disease still in the system, but on the contrary removes the cause of the trouble, heals the parts affected and leaves them in a purely healthy condition. A bottle kept in the honse for use when the diseases make their appear ance, will save doctor's bills and a long spell of serious illness. A trial will convince you of these facts.
