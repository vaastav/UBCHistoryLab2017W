Demand, ing the restoration -of the American flag to its ancient place upon the seas.T President Taft. In hid annual message delivered to Congress yesterday, urged strongly that legislation be enacted to establish a ship subsidy or other wise guarantee the establishment of the rapid development of merchant marine in this country. The message might be summed up in the following trinity: National economy, the enlargement of opportunities for foreign trade and the strengthening of confidence of capital in domestic investment. The entire message is a "safe and sane" document, strong in its conservatism. " The president's most urgent recom mendation is in favor of legislation for the institution of a mercantile marine service and possibilities for its expansion before the Panama canal is finished and one paragraph of the speech in this connection reads:' "I alluded to this most important subject in my last annual message. Unless prompt action be taken' the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail in international maritime business of his great contri bution to the means of the world's commercial Intercourse. Where could we find in case of war the transports and subsidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without a body? For many reasons I cannot yrge too strongly upon this Congress the pas sage of a measure by mail subsidy or other invention to develop the Amer ican marine." Next in the rank of Importance and :3c i)rer the Monroe & Chamblisfc ; urged only a little less strongly than the plea for a merchant marine is the demand for the trained fighting force i of the United States be increased by j laws augmenting the number of com j missioned officers and through closer cooperation between the national ; guards of the various states and the 'regular standing army. The president urges the fortification of the Panama canal declaring that America is building it and that it is fitting that America should protect it. Mr. Taft is anxious that the canal be come a' paying enterprise, suggesting that the toll of one dollar per net ton be charged ships passing through. President Taft takes a strong stand in the matter of disposing of public lands bearing coal, urging that the government not sell these valuable e4tle, (

Mr. Taft de clares in favor of making 2,500 acres the maximum. He frankly admits that Secretary Ballinger of the inter ior opposes this plan; having set forth his objections in his annual report. The president believes that Congress ought to prohibit interstate cojnmerce railroads from owning or controlling ships doing a business through the canal, such a course being urged to save the people of the United States the benefit of legitimate competition. This enactment must "come sooner or later, the president points out. The president deplores the abuse of the postal franking privilege which is annually, costing, the country millions and demands that Congress take steps to check it. Declaring that the poor man has no show in the courts against a rich op ponent, Mr. Taft strongly urges that changes be made in American court procedure, especially in the apellate branches, modeled, after the English system. Other recommendations and demands include the following: The abolition of "pork barrel" meth ods in appropriating .money for the construction of public buildings and the institution of a commission to In vestigate the necessity, of buildings and report to Congress; increase pf tariff commission from three members to five; that Congress honor Com mander Peary for discovering the North Pole; conservation laws to save forests from natural and humar rav ages; immediate institution of parcels posts;, steps to aid the proposed negro exposition to celebrate the granting off freedom; wider powers for the Inter state Commerce Commission.
