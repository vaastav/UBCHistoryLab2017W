ROBBERS GET WO Martinsburg Bank Safe Blown Open Early This Morning Special to tho Missourian MEXICO Mo Dec C Robbers broke into the Martinsburg bank at Martinsburg Mo about fourteen miles east of here at 2 oclock this morning They blew open the door of the vault and stole 1500 in cash No trace of the robbers havo been found The interior of the building a one story brick structure was wrecked by the explosion WANTS CANNING FACTORY TOO Boone County Farmer Says It Would Help Equalize General Prices E E Tyler a graduate of engineer ing schools of three universites Mis souri Kansas and Nebraska who is nor farming in Boone county believes Columbia should have a canning fac tory as well as a condensed milk fac tory The surplus products of the farmers near Columbia would easily supply material for such factories he believes Mr Tyler visited Columbia yesterday and called up the Univer sity Missourian to give his opinions about tho proposed new factory The special reason why Mr Tyler believes the plan for factories here is practicable is that inexpensive power can be obtained by building a dam across Hinkson creek Enough power to run the city water and light plant also could bo obtained from such a dam he says I am acquainted with the farmers within a radius ol twelve miles from Columbia said Mr Tyler and all of them are eager tor these factories They say that in the spring when the University closes the demand for tneir produce falls almost to nothing Cucumbers that sell for 25 cents a quart in winter can be bought here for 25 cents a bushel in the summer they say If these factories were in Columbia there would be nnicli less difference between the sianer and winter prices CHRISTMAS FOR HAPPY HOLLOW Children of Columbia Suburb Will Bo Given Dolls By Y W C A The women of

promised to the association and several money offerings made I i NUMBER 65 ICE PLANT DAiAGEHY FIRE Machinery Room and Con tents Almost a Total Loss WATER PRESSURE IS BAD Hose Fastened to Plug Three Blocks Away Though Another Is Nearby The T J Morris Ice plant near the Wabash station caught fire this morn ing about 5 oclock and all the Ice making machinery was ruined before the fire was put out The cause of the blaze is unknown as is the exact amount of damage done The building and machinery together cost nally 5C000 There was 8000 in surance on the building and 9000 on the machinery The damage to the building amounted to probably 100 or 200 The walls are of concrete blocks and are still standing The roof over half this section fell in and a water tank was destroyed All the machinery used in making ice was rendered use less by fire and the falling roof Owner Discovers Fire Tho fire was discovered by T J Morris the owner who was sleeping in tho building with his son and an employe Mr Morris was aroused by the odor of smoke and he says the fire at that time was confined to the roof Sixteen horses which were in a wing of the building were taken out when the fire was first discovered Two hundred pounds of ammonia was in a drum in the room where the fire caught but there was no way to take it out The fire department arrived at the ice plant about fifteen minutes after the alarm was turned in An engine in the Wabash yards had given the alarm to persons in the neighborhood and a crowd of about fifty personB camo and assisted the fire depart ment Finally Find Water Plug There is a fire plug half a block from the ico plant but Chief Newman seemed to know nothing about it and fastened the hose to a plug three blocks away This took up so much of the hose that there was not enough left to reach the fire After an ar gument with the police and onlookers the chief fastened a hose to the nearby plug There was not enough water pressure to enable tho firemen to break windows with the stream so rocks were used to make openings for tho water In spite of tho low pres sure there was still sufficient force when tho water was shut off at the nozzle to break the hose After the water was shut off at the plug and the leaks repaired tho fire was put out in about half an hour By this time however everything inflammable in the freezing room had been ruined and the roof had fallen In The refrigerator room on one side and the concrete walls on tho other aide kept the fire from spreading Fountain Rothwell a Columbia councilman who saw the fire said that the city council tho mayor or some one should see to it at once that Co lumbia has better fire protection Hes Had Hard Luck Mr Morris said this morning that had the right kind of work been dono by the fire department he believed the damage would have amounted to only a few dollars as nothing except one section of the roof was afire when tho department arrived This ice plant seems to be a hard luck proposition said Mr Morris About ten years ago it burned to tne ground Then- two years ago a cyclone came along and carried away the roof of the present building Now the most important part of the plant is destroyed The ice machinery I think is worth less now The building itself is damaged only on the roof The roof can be rebuilt I suppose these concrete walls are good yet
