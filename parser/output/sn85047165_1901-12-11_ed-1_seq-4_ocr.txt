Tt aia age of PreaWeat Room vett woeltt ladtctta that the aagar of Hawaii aright well exclaim "arre us from fool frienda." When AcUac Oorerner Cooper went to . I m Yraetriactoa with the report ot tae, Ooveroor there was considerable apecalattoa as to why it had become ' v- ,i - make for the s?tlema to a ptlcrinaae to the National Capital Jaat for th purpose of carrying his report. Governor Dole entrusted hie arat annual report to the mails in lMt aad it reached Washington in 4 tiase aad without any sheets AH other Terr'torlal Governor's from the beginning of the national !xiateace have entrusted their reports to the United States malls and ho far j as is knows there Is no record of any such reports having been lost. Bat then Mr. Cooper had a special relwrtoa to perform. It was very nice to go to Washington as the of siteclal interests hre aad hare expenses paid out of thoj public treason. Mr. Cooper prcpoaod to show the unttiated In Hawaii what the cou'd do In ot the one great industry in Hawaii. The err for some time had beos pore roolle labor." Since the OrgaateAct had gone into effect the gates had been practically closed to the crotieg from As'a, but Mr. Cooper proposed to show thev could be opeaed by him when he presented his powerful rtde lights on the situation at Wafhiasjtoa. la his report as Acting-Governor, Mr. Cooper spread himself or trying to show bow the Hawaiian wen fast dytag rff aad how necessary it wa to pemlt store Chinese to come here to work on the p'antstions (s'c). And as If this were ot enough. Mr. Cooper proceeded ia the most convincing wav to show bow sugar stocks would drop ia price if Chinese were n't allowed unrestricted entrance to these Islands, and .he even that tho many ftkllled laborers who found T0t ? small A b rU,,n;ilr possessions, there might, per- means would becowe bankrupt. Not content with stEtlng all this la h1 report Mr. Cooper sought out "Tasa County Jm" Wilson. Secretary of Agriculture, to pour his tale into Wltae" oar so that It would be certain to roach the President and wh?n ones It reached Roosevelt that gentleman, according to Cooper's Idea, woW at dace insert in his msssago a clause urging Congress to pass a special bUl to permit the free of Chinese to Hawaii. Evidently Cooper's views upon tho subject of Chinese Immigration to Hawaii and the dangers threatening this Territory If more Chlnes0 were not brought in must havo reached tho President's tttonUon. Mr. Cooper declared in tho most positive terms that "the prosonce of large numbers of Chinese and Japanese has not proved detrimental to skilled un-skilled American laborers." And thea to substantiate this statement Mr. Cooper, Innocent, gulioloss man that h Is, BUbaHbad a stateraewt showlag th number ot uak!Hed laborers upon the plantations. This table show the total number ot unaudited fafcrreru employed for the of 19WH to have been S9.5S7. of whom 27,537 were Japanese; 4.976 wore. Chlaese; 2.W5 were Porto W.

There ees lltt'e reason to do.be that Preefdeat Rooaere't mast hnve had his attention especially called to this part of Mr. Cooper's report. The President onset indeed bare become 'Bpresrod with It, for does be not say la hie message: - v "In Hawaii our aim must be to the Territory cn the traditional American llr.es. Ve do ivt wish a region cf large estates tilled by cheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men, who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this end In view; the well- being of the average home maker must afford the' true test of the healthy development of the Islands. The land policy should, as nearly as possible, be modeled on our homestead system. I regard it a? necessary, with this end in view, to immediately the law Jng Chinese laborers and to strength- ... r en it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely, Mr. Cooper should prepare another report as Acting Governor. All that is needed to bring about the happy consummation ot making those Islands such an American community as the President savs they should become. Is to turn Henry E Cooper loose and let him tell about the benlflcent re- sults of unrestricted immigration of Chinese and Japanese, backed up with statistics such as published lu his recent report We do not bollevo Governor Dole himself could have done half so well. THE 

GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT SERVICE. Private steamship interests are making strenuous efforts to indiico tha government to abandon its transport service in tho Pacific and turn its of this character over to them. Thoy are hardly to bo blamed for taking this course, for the reason that the government carrying trade with its insular possessions Is very large, and likely to bo profitable to them if they can obtain It. But It is not clear that the transaction would be equally profitable or desirable for the government It has gathered together at groat pains and heavy expense a large fleot of vessels exclusively for this transport service. Tho service has given ontire satisfaction; indeed, to General Ludington, wno fid J' made an investigation of the subject, it is superior to that given on commercial vessels. If thero were any prospects that the COVPrnmOnt ttrmtlrt ftn.. n..AMnM t, j haps, be some show of reason to 1 propositions from private steamship interests to carry tho troops and supplies. But tho islands In the Pacific now under our control are likely to romnin so for an Indefinite period. , Thousands of troops are being sent back and forth monthly, and great ! i quantities of stores aro being constantly forwarded to the garrisons. This work surely can bo done more satisfactorily by the government than by private companies. The experience of the government in disposing of transports which it believed wore no longer needed in the Atlantic was not a happy one. It was a heavy loser by tho transaction. Most of the vessels cost large sums to purchase and refit, yet when sold they brought merely nominal prices. There is no reason to believe tho result wculd be different if the transports in the Pacific were disposed of, and this certain loss must be taken into account when propositions from private steamship companies aro considered. Even though private enterprise offers to perform tho service for less money than It now costs the government, it is doubtful whether tho chango would be wise. Tho latler, according to com- petant authority, docs it more lacioniy; oesiaes, tnere is no know- Ing how suddenly the transport vessels now owned may be Imperatively needed. the coacem of the Thurston Organ about people who are now supporting Judge Little for Governor having endorsed some one else two years, ago ? fV, ? bJ!,the popaUlrity of certain to ba Governor of Ha waii wthln a few months alarms the gangstcra. There never was a grealv untruth uttered by any man in pub'ic or private life than that uttered bv Hoary 1 Cooper In his rnort as uovernor wherein he said on pegs 63: "Much has been said about tha cm. nose aad Japanese by the planters, In answer to such criticism, it may safely be said that such never has. does not now ad never will In. ! - - i terfere with cither American skilled or unskilled labor. As a hired lobbyist J Mr. Cooper appears to hare mad? a most lamentable failure. A lobbyist to bo successful most deal In some facts occasionally, bat Jlr. Coopsr seemed coaarmed In the idea that facts were s methiag to be W. O. Sm'th. in hfs Interview In ib Star, said, concerning the probable appointment of a new Governor for Hawaii: "Yon might say, however that In case of an appointment to fil' a vacancy it will be one that wil" prove In no sense alarming and wil be welcomed by the bstter sense of the community." Since readin? President Ro'seveifs message we ar qalta ready to believe that Mr. Smit spoke more truly aad more wisely than be knew. It can be set down as a ari m that President Roosevelt wil' at the earliest possible date appoint a man Governor of this Territory wb will aid him In everv way in Hawaii along the lines laid dow by the President In his messag President Roosevelt Is not the man t permit the Territory to be pulle backward bv an Incompetent Gove" nor when It is in his power to make change. The Dole-Thurston gang which wa going to move on Congress In an er deayor to have a bill passed iimilir tho franchise in this Territory wi' no doubt conclude, since reading th President's message, that thi3 wintc will not be a good time to start tn movement It Is not too much to say that Prs' dent Roosevelt's message is the raos' notable document of its kind that ha' ever been sent to Congress. That it will make Its Impress upon the nations of the world, as well as upon his own cruntry, is assured. Frcm the tone of the President's message It would appear that " the President knew pretty well what he was doing when he approved the findings of the Attorney General in re th? charges against Judge Humphreys. The Thurston Bar Association should call another meeting. It is Important for the thirty-seven to discipline Pres'dent Roosevelt for not consulting the Devil's partner bsfcre writing anything about Hawaii ia his message. In no way can Hawaii bo developed so rapidly on the l'aes laid down by President Roosevelt as by the appointment of Judge Gilbert F. Little to be Governor of the Territory. Beet vs. Cane Sugar Interests. From the Baltimore Sun. Tho recent cut In granulated sugar from 5.03 cents to 3.5 cents per pound made bv the Sugar Trust would have been agreeable enough to the public had it been general, but the cut in price applied only to sugar shipped to Missouri river points, the Eastern price remaining unchanged. The reduction A is part, it seems, of a cam- pafgn against tho beet sugar interests. "The cut is aimed." savs th? Beet Sugar Gazette, "at the bset su gar refiners of Utah, Colorado. California and Nebraska, where of the entire beet sugar product of the Unit-d States is manufactured. of It is the practice of these Pfoa'l'c"S to contract for the sale of their entire output at a discount of 10 points from the Sugar Trust'? figures, and at th's dlrcount the beet sugar makers have been able to market all their sugar. If compelled to go 10 point- below the trusts cut price 3U cents the beet sugar refiners would be subjectFd a heavy loss and would probably be forced in to close their refineries and cease production. Incidentally, of course, the market for sugar beets would be destroyed, involving tremendous losses t? the farmers, who have undertaken beet culture on a large scale."' The fact that the best sugar people made the first cut does not relieve me trust rrom the olum of using its enormous power to strangle an infant home Industry. The beet sugar men as well as the trust, are interested In the tariff which protects both in exacting unnecessary high pr'ces from American consumers. The prices and profits ot both are at the expense of the masses wou'd prefer cheap sugar. The people in the Missouri River Valley are probably only getting hnl their sugar now at the reason- ame ana proper price, while the rest of the countrv is bring Impossdupon """ - " cover oi me tariff walL We cannot fol'ow the Gtzrtte. how- act rver m ts paragraph to ths effect that "real American sugar is not can sugar.

This taps the milk n of the cocoanut, which is the effort o' the Sugar Trust to promote the us of cane sugar rather than beet sugar. .wuius ot me inuer Being a local to iidstrv in the several states and not roadilv brought under, the trust's control.

The trust sees tie large development e bet sugar industry In this "T wia soma alarm, u it grows to soth an extent as to sspprr the home market the trust's business will be Impaired, if not destroyed. On tho other case, if raw Cuban cane sugar is admitted free ot duty all will be well for the trust. Porto Rico will send ns raw cano sugar free of duty, and so will Hawaii, while Louisiana will continue to produce largely, but all together will not come near meeting the American demand. Ia part he practical question Is whether we shall have annexation or reciprocity Df trade with Cuba on such terms as will supply our wants and incidentally Steep the trust's refineries busy, or foster by means of the bounty of a sigh tariff the rapid development of beet sugar growing. It Is largely a question cf choosing' mix masters. We still Import German "eet sugar in considerable quantities. ut would prefer, if we must use beet sugar, to- have it grown here. As a weetener cane sugar is bettor. If he question of our sugar supply could be divorced frcm the tariff question nd considered without reference to he interests of the odious Sugar 'rust the public would doubtless give ts voice for the more wholesome cane ugar of Louisiana, Cuba and Porto ico, and discard beet sugar, whether uade In tho United State3 or in Eu- ope. But tho trust. In the character f a free trader, is suspected. Its ad- of free raw sugar is supposed o be complicated also with the propaganda. There are so lany wheels within wheels when Fed-i-al law is once prostituted to promoting favored business interests, hat the average citizen is puzzled and irdly knows what course to take hether to shout for free raw cane ugar or for taxed raw and refined set sugar and a new "infant" The consumer nowhere comes in. 

AMUSEMENTS. The free exhibitions on the wire bv the Carter Bros, in front the Orpheum each evening at 7.30 are drawing great crowds of people. The performance is a thrilling one. There is also a complete change if program beginning last night and will continue the balance of thi week. The first part contains a bunch of iew songs and Jokes, while the Olio iresents several new features. Madam Plato made her re-appearance last night after a brief illness and scored a hit w'th her magnificent voice. This artist ranks in America as the rolored soprano now on the stage. Wise & Milton, also Dea3 & gave new sketches replete with comedy and, song of a nature to keep the houe in laughter. Deas & Robinson are especially clever in their dancing. Robinson's abllltv to twist h's legs in all kinds of grotesque shapss makes him the most comical dancer we have ever seen. Th Great Christian gave another exhibition of his marvelous skill on the foot cycles. He is certainly a wonde. The evening entertainment concluded w'th one of Hcgan's -side-splitting farces entitlrd "Tho Haunted School House." wh'ch kept the house in a roar of laughter until the curtain went down. Some new talent arrived by the Sonoma which will be added tr th? a'readv large companv, and together with the people coming on the Sierra. Hogan will have an organization which for quality and quantity will be second to no colored company in tno world FASHIONS OF 1920. Frenchman's Forscast of Feminine Fade Twenty Years Hence. From the London Telegraph. When thpy are grown up, the young ladies of the future who were born with this centurv win look back with amazement on the manners and dress the davs when th'ir mothers were girls. If M. Octave Uzanne be a true prophet, in things fm'nino will move, not bv degrees, but by remarkable bounds b'tween the present rear and 1920. The long dresses of today will appear far more qua'nt to the girls of that period than do the flounced skirts of the 80s to the modern woman. In 1920. savs M. Octave Uzanne, the "feminine prejudice," which causes ladles, except of course ballet?. "t ob?ct to diolaing the cclves of their legs." will have become entirelv extinct "Rational dress." as advocated bv extremists. w'H not, however The will not oust the petticoat, but the latter will nver fall below the knee. On th other hand, the nresent clinging skin will be abolished, and dresses w'll crow fuller tn' width as thev decrae in length. M.
