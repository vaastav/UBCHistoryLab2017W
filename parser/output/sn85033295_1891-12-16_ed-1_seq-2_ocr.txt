London, Dec. 14. —The most serious of all the disasters that have occurred during the present storm is the wreck of the British ship Enterkin, Capt. Sin clair, which was bound from Hull for Brisbane. She was caught in the storm while bound down the channel, and de spite every effort made to save her, she was driven upon the Galloher Sands, off the port of Ramsgate, County of Kent. Thirty lives were lost in this disaster, every person except an ap prentice boy being drowned. The Enterkin met the hurricane Sat urday night. She was standing on an inshore tack, and the wind blew so furiously that it was impossible to carry uail enough to prevent her from making leeway, and she was driven ashore almost broadside. After she had struck, a part of the crew succeeded in launching a boat and got clear off the ship. They headed shoreward, but were almost im mediately thrown into the sea by the swamping of their boat by a high roller which broke over the stern and filled it. Every man who was in the boat was drowned, almost in sight of his comrades on the wreck. Shortly afterward the ship, which bad been standing upon a comparatively even keel, was struck by a tremendously high sea, and she heeled over, throwing every person aboard of her into the water. Only one of them, the appren tice boy, whose name is .Lewis, suc ceeded in gaining the weather rigging, which by the keeling over of the ves sel was just awash. Here the lad re mained throughout the night, drenched and almost frozen. On Sunday morning a fishing smack under very" short sail sighted the wreck and bore down to it. With much diffi culty a boat was got alongside the En tearin and Lewis was taken off. Many of the thirty drowned seamen were for eigners. The rain has been so heavy in the dis tricts drained by the Thames that that river is rapidly rising. In some places the low lands are inundated. The slopes at Windsor Castle and some parts of the royal park are partly submerged. Reports from various points in South Wales states that the gale has been es pecially severe in that part of the coun try. The wind storm was accompanied by heavy rain, and the result has been that some of the rivers have overflowed their banks, doing much damage. The list of casualities caused by the storm is constantly gaining fresh acces sions. The great number of injuries in the country districts have been caused by falling trees. Many persons have been badly hurt from that cause. Quite a number of accidents have also been caused by the wreckage of roofs and chimneys, falling bricks, tiles, etc. 

DEATH OF CHIEF MAYES. Kuler of the Cherokee Nation Passe* Away at Talilequah, I. TANARUS, Washington, D. C., Dec. 14. —A pri vate telegram received here announces the death at Tahlequah, I. TANARUS., of Mayes, the chief of the Cherokee nation, at 0 o’clock this morning. The assistant chief is said to be dangerously ill. Joel Bryan Mayes was born in the old Cherokee reservation, in Georgia, on Oc tober 2. 1803. nis father was 'white and his mother of mixed blood. When a boy Joel was removed to the Cherokee reser vation in Indian Territory, and graduate ? at the Cherokee Male Seminary in 1856. He taught until the breaking out of the civil war. when lie entered the Confeder ate army, serving to the close ot the war as a quartermaster. He held several minor offices alter the war, becoming chief cierk of the Cherokee court and county judge. He was then chosen associate, and later chief justice of the supreme court. In August, 1887, he became chief of the Cherokee Nation, ' MISS ST. JOHN BEATEN. Verdict Against the Actress in the Lon don Divorce Case. London, Dec. 14. —The jury in the case of Florence St. John, the actress, who sued for a divorce, to-day returned a verdict denying the petition of the fair pliintiff. The case went to the jury without argument after Mr, Cohen, the co-respondent in the cross-suit of the actress’ husband, had given his testimony. He said that his relations with Miss St. John had al ways been of the most honorable kind. The evidence given by the maid, that he had gone into Miss St. John’s room late at night, was, according to Mr. Co hen, absolutely false. He had never been alone with Miss St. John in her dressing-room. He met the petitioner at Monte Carlo by accident. He did not fall in love with her. The only feeling he entertained for her was of respect and admiration. GRIPPE IS HERE AGAIN. The Influenza Epidemic in the United States in a Mild Form. Chicago, 111., Dec. 14.—Special dis patches to a morning paper from a num ber of the larger cities of the country, from New York to San Francisco, show that on account of the prevailing mild, damp weather, the grippe is again prevalent. At some points it is quite severe, while at others it is of a mild form. Gov.-elect McKinley is suffer ing from an attack of the malady at Can ton, O. Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 14. —Influenza seems to be on a rampage in Nashville. The estimate comes from good authority that no less than 8,000 people here are now under treatment for it. M’KINLEY IS IMPROVING. The Governor-Fleet o< Ohio Recovering from the Grippe—Ouay Ketter, Canton, 0., Dec. 14. —Gov.-elect Mc- Kinley continues to improve, and is to-day able to be up, although lie is still confined to his room. The attend ng physician has denied him the privilege of receiving any callers, and this rule will be en forced throughout the week. Pitts m TtH, Pa., Dec. 14. — Senator M. S. Guay, who was attacked with vertigo on Saturday, has entirely recovered, and is able to be about to day as usual. PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The following is the message of Pres ident Harrison, read to Congress at the opening session: To the Senate and House of Representv tives: The reports of the heads of the several executive departments, required by law to be submitted to me, which are herewith trans mitted, and the reports of the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general, made direct ly to Congress, furnish a comprehensive view of the administrative work of the last fiscal year, relating to internal affairs. It would be of great advantage if these reports could have an attentive perusal by every member of Congress and by all who take an interest in public al lairs. Such a perusal could not fail to excite a higher appreciation of the vast labor and con scientious effort which are given to the conduct of our civil administration. The reports will, I believe, show that every question has been ap proached, considered, and decided from the standpoint of public duty, and upon considera tions affecting the public interest? alone. Again I invite to every branch of the service the attention and scrutiny of Congress. 

SETTLING SEALING DISPUTES. Arrangements for the Arbitration of the Behring Sea Question. The work of the State Department during the last year has been characterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and by dip lomatic results of a notable and highly bene ficial character. Among these are the reciprocal trade arrangements which have been con cluded, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Section b of the tariff law, with the republic of Brazil, with Spain lor its West India posses sions, and with San Domingo Like negotia tions with other countries have been much ad vanced, and it is hoped that before the close of the year further definitive trade arrangements of great value will be concluded. In view of the reports which had been re ceived as to the diminution of the seal herds in the Behring Sea, I deemed it w ise tc propose to Her Majesty’s government in February last that an agreement lor a closed season should be made, pending the negotiations lor arbitration which then seemed to be approaching a favorable con clusion. Alter much correspondence and de lays, tor which this government w-as not respon sible, an agreement was reached ami signed on the 16th of June, by which Great Britain un dertook from that date and until May 1, 1892, to prohibit the killing by her subjects of seals in the Behring Sea, and the government of the United Stales, during the same period, to en loroe its existing prohibition against pelagic sealing, and to limit the catch by the lur seal company upon the islands to 7,500 skins. If this agreement could have been reached earlier, in response to the strenuous eudeavors of this gov ernment, U w ould have been more effective; but. coming even as late as it did, it unquestionably resulted in greatly diminishing the destruction of the seals by the Canadian sealers. In my last annual message 1 stated that the basis of arbitration proposed by Her Majesty’s government for the adjustment of the long pending controversy as to the seal fisheries was not acceptable. lam glad now to be able to announce that terms satisfactory to this gov ernment have been agreed upon, and that an agreement as to arbitrators is all that is neces sary to the completion of the convention. In view of the advanced position which this gov ernment has taken upon the subject of interna tional arbitration, this renewed expression of our adherence to this method for the settlement of disputes such as have arisen in the Behring Sea will, I doubt not, meet with the concur rence of Congress. Provision should be made for a joint demarca • tion of the frontier line between Canada and the United States, wherever required by the in creasing border settlements, and especially for the exact location of the water boundary in the straits and rivers. I should have been glad to announce some fa vorable disposition of the boundary dispute be tween Great Britain and Venezuela, touching the western frontier of British Guiana, but the friendly efforts of tne United States in that di rection have thus far been unavailing. This government will continue to express its concern at any appearance of foreign encroachment on territories long under the administrative con trol of American states. The determination of a disputed boundary is easily attainable by amicable arbitration, where the rights of the respective parties rest, as here, on historic facts, readily ascertainable. The Taw oi the last Congress, providing a sys tem of inspection for our moats intended lor export, and clothing the President with power to exclude foreign products Irom our market in case the country sending them should perpetu ate unjust discriminations against any product ot the United States, placed this government in a position to effectively urge the removal of such discriminations against our meats. It is gratifying to be able to state that Germany’, Denmark. Italy, Austria and France, in the or der named, have opened their ports to inspected American pork products. The removal of these restrictions in every instance was asked lor and given solelv upon the ground that we had now provided a meat inspection that should oe ac cepted as adequate to the complete removal of the dangers, real or fancied, which had been previously urged. The State Department, our ministers abroad, and the secretary ol agri culture have co-operated with unllagging and intelligent zeal for the accomplishment of this great result. The outlines of an agreement have been reached with Germany, looking to equitable trade concessions in consideration of the continued free importation of her sugars, but thi time has not yet arrived when this cor respondence can be submitted to Congress. The recent political disturbances In the re public of Brazil hare excited regret and solici tude. The information we possessed was too meager to enable us to form a satisfactory judg ment of the causes leading to the temporary as sumption of supreme power by President Fon seca, but this government did not fail to ex press to him its "anxious solicitude for the peace of Brazil and for the maintenance of the free political institutions which had recently been established there, nor to offer our advice that great moderation should be observed in the clash of parlies and the contest for leadership. These counsels were received in the most friendly spirit, and the latest information is that constitutional government has been re-es tablished without bloodshed. THE NEW 

ORLEANS LYNCHING. Progress in the Negotiations Between the United States and Italy. The lynching at New Orleans, in March last, of eleven men of Italian nativity by a mob of citi zens was a most deplorable and discreditable incident. It did not, however, have its origin in any general animosity to the Italian people, nor in any disrespect to the government of Italy, with which our relations were of the most friendly character. The fury of the mob was directed against these men as the supposed participants or ac essories in the murder oi a city officer. Ido not allude to this as mitiga ting in any degree this offense against law and humanity, but only as affecting the interna tional questions which grew out of it. It was once represented by the Italian minister that several ol those whose iives had been taken by the mob were Italian subjects, and a demand was made for the punishment of the partici pants and for an indemnity to the families of those who were killed. It is to be regretted that the manner in which these claims were presented was not such as to promote a calm discussion of the questions involved; but this may well be attributed to the excitement and indignation which the crime naturally evoked. The views of this government as to its obligations to foreigners domiciled here were fully stated in the correspondence, as well as its purpose to make an investigation of the af fair with a view to determine whether there were present any circumstances that could, un der such rules of duty as we had indicated, cre ate an obligation upon the United Slates. The temporary absence of a minister plenipotentia ry of Italy at this capital has retarded the fur ther correspondence, but it is not doubted that a friendly conclusion is attainable. home suggestions growing out of this unhappy incident are worthy the attention of Congress. It would, I believe,' be entirely competent for Congress to make offenses against the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled in the United States cognizable in the federal courts. This has not, however, beer, done, and the federal officers and courts have no power in such eases to intervene either for the protection of a toreign citizen or for the punishment of his slayers. It seems to me to follow, in this state ot the law, that the officers of the state charged with police and judicial powers in such cases must, in the consideration "of international questions, grow ing out ot such incidents, be regarded in such sense as federal agents us to make this govern ment answerable for 1 heir acts in eases-where it would be answerable if the Uuited States had used its oonstitutio al power to dehue and punish crimes against treaty rights. 

SEIZURE OF THE ITAfA. Congreos Informed of the Capture of the Insurgent War Vessel. The civil war in Chili, which began in Jan uary last, was continued, but, fortunately, with infrequent armed collisions, until August 28, when the congressional forces landed near Val paraiso, and, alter a bloody engagement, capt ured that city, I'resl ient Bu Irnaceda at once recognized that bis cause was lost, and a pro- visional government was speedily established by the victorious party. Mur minister Wiis promptly directed to recognize and put himself in communication with t h is goverement as soon as it shonld have established its de facto char acter, which was done. During the pendency of this civil contest frequent indirect appeals were made to this government to extend bellig erent rights to the insurgents and to give audi ence to their representatives, This was de clined, and that policy was pursued through out which this government, when wrenched by civil war, so strenuously asisted upon on the part ot European nations. The Data, an armed vessel commanded by a naval officer of the insurgent fleet, manned by its sailors and with soldiers on board, was seized under process of the United States court at can Diego, Cal., for a violation of our neu trality laws. While in the custody of an officer of the court the vessel was forcibly wrested irom his control and put to sea. It would have been inconsistent with the dignity and self-re spect of this government not to have insisted that the Data should bo returned to l?an Diego to abide the judgment of the court. This was so clear to the Junta of the congressional party, established at Iquique, that, before the arrival of the Itata at that port, the secretary of foreign relations of the provisional government ad dressed to Hear Admiral Brown, command ing the United States naval forces, a communication, from which the follow ing is au extract: “The provisional government has learned by the cablegrams of the Associated Press that the transport itata, detained in San Diego by order of the United States for taking on board munitions of war, and in possession of the marshal, left the port, carrying on hoard this official, who was landed at a point near the coast, and then continued her voyage, * * * * If this news be correct, this government would deplore the conduct of the Itata, and, as an evidence that it is not dis posed to support or agree to the infraction of the laws of tne United States, the undersigned takes advantage of the personal relations you have been good enough to maintain with him since your arrival in this port to declare to you that as soon as she is within reach of our orders this government will put the itata, with the arms and munitions she took on hoard in San Diego, at the disposition of the United States.” A trial in the district court of the United States for the Southern District of California has recently resulted in a decision holding, among other things, that, inasmuch as the con gressional party had not been recognized as a belligerant, the acts done in its interest could not be a violation of our neutrality laws. From this judgment the United States bus appealed, not that the condemnation of the vessel is a mutter of importance, but that we may know what the present state of our law is; for, if this construction of the statute is correct, there is obvious necessity for revision and amendment. During the progress of the war in Chili this government tendered its good offices to bring about a peaceful adjustment, and it was at one mie hoped that a good result might be reached: hut in this wo were disappointed. The in structions to oui naval officers and to our min ister at Santiago, irom the flrst to the last of this struggle, enjoined upon them the most im partial treatment and absolute non-interfer ence. I am satisfied that these instructions wore observed, and that our representatives were always watchful to use their influence im partially to the interest of humanity, and, on more than one occasion, did so elfectively. We could not forget, however, that this govern ment was in diplomatic relations with the then established government of Chili, as it is now in such relations with the successor of that government. 1 am quite sure Unit I’rcsident Montt, who has, under circumstances of promise lor the peace of Chili, been installed as presi dent of that republic, will not desire that, in the unfortunate event of any revolt against his authority, the policy of this government should bo other tnan that which we have recently ob served. No official complaint of the conduct of our minister or of our naval otlicers during the struggle has been presented to this government; and it is a matter of regret that so many of our own people should have given ear to unofficial charges ami complaints that manifestly had their origin in rival interests and in a wish to pervert the relations of the United fctates with Chili. The collapse of the government of Balmnce da brought about a condition which is unfor tnneately too familiar in the history of the Cen tral and South American states. With the overthrow of the Balmaceda government, he and many of his councilors and officers be came at once luglves for their lives and appealed to the commanding officers of the foreign naval vessels in the harbor of Val paraiso and to the resident foreign ministers at Santiago for asylum. This asylum was freely given, according to my information, by the naval vessels of several foreign powers and by r several of the legations at Santiago. The American minister, as well as his colleagues, acting upon the impulses of humanity, extend ed asylum to political refugees whose lives were in peril. I have not been willing to direct the surrender of such of these persons as are still in the American legation without suitable conditions. It is believed that the government of Chili is not in a position, in view of the precedents with which it has been connected, to broadly deny the right of asylum, and the correspond ence has not thus far presented any such denial. The treatment ot our minister for a time was such as to call for a decided protest, and it was very gratifying to observe that unfriendly measures, which were undoubtedly the result of the prevailing excitement, were at once re scinded or suitably relaxed. 

MASSACRES BY CHINESE MOBS. This Government to Demand Protection to Citizens Abroad. The late outbreak against foreigners in vari ous parts of the Chinese Empire has been a cause of deep concern in view of the numerous stablishment s of our citizens in the interior of that country. This government can do no less than insist upon a continuance of the protect ive and punitory measures which the Chinese government has heretofore applied. No effort will be omitted to protect our citizens peace ably sojourning in China, but recent unofheial information indicates that what was at first re garded as an outbreak of mob violence against soreigners has assumed the larger form of an iu nrrecuoa against public order. The Chinese government has declined to re ceive Mr. Blair as the minister of the United States on the ground that, as a participant, while a senator, in the enactment of the exist ing legislation against the introduction of Chi nese laborers, he has become unfriendly and objectionable to China. I have felt constrained to point out to the Chinese government the mi tenablenesa of this position, which seems to rest as much on the unacceptability of our legisla tion as on that of the person chosen, and which, if admitted, would practically debar the selec tion of any representative so long us the exist iug laws remain in force. You will be called upon to consider the ex pediency of making special provision by law' of the temporary admission of some Chinese arti sans and laborers in connection with the ex hibit of Chinese industries at the approaching Columbian Exposition. I regard it as desirable that the Chinese exhibit be facilitated in every proper way. A question has arisen with the government of Spain touching the rights of American citizens in the Caroline Islands. Our citizens ' there, long prior to the confirmation of Spain’s claim to the islands, had secured by settlement and purchase certain rights, to the recognition and maintenance of which the faith of Spain was pledged. I have had reason within the past year very strongly to protest against the failure to carry out this pledge on the part of His Ma jesty’s ministers, which has resulted in great in justice and injury to the American residents. The government and people of Spain propose to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the discov ery of America by holding an exposition at Madrin, which w ill open on the 12lh of Septem ber and continue until the 81st of December, 1892. A cordial invitation has been extended to the United States to take part in this commemor ation, and, as Spain was one of the first nations to express the intention to participate in the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, it would be very appropriate lor this government to give this invitation its friendly promotion. THREATENED WAR WITH CHILI. Congress May Receive a Later Message on the Dispute. On the 16th of October an event occurred in Valparaiso so serious and tragic in iis circum stances and results as to very justly excite the indignation of our people and to call for prompt and decided action on the part of this govern ment, A considerable number of the sailors of the United Slates steamship Baltimore, then in the harbor of Valparaiso, being upon shore leave and unarmed, were assault ed by armed men nearly simultaneously in different localities in the city. One petty officer was killed outright and seven or eight seamen seriously wounded, one of whom has since died, so savage and brutal was the assault that several ol our sailors re ceived mote than two. and one as many as eighteen stab wounds. An investigation oflhe affair was promptly made by a board of officers of the Baltimore, and their report shows that these assaults were unprovoked: that our men were conducting themselves in a peaceable and orderly manner, and that some of the police of the city took part In the assault and used their weapons with fatal effect, while a few others,w ith some well-disposed ciii/ens, endeavored to pro tect our men. Ihirty-six of our sailors were arrested, and some of them, while being taken to prUon. were cruelly beaten and maltreated. .he inct that they w ere all discharged, no criminal charge being lodged against any one ol them, shows very clearly that they were in nocent of any breach of the peace. So far as I have yet been able to learn no other explanation of this bloody work has been sug gested than that it had its origin in hostility to these men as sail jrs of the United States, wear ing the uniform of their government, and not in any individual act or personal animosity. The attention of the Chilian government was at once called to this aff air, and a statement ot the facts obtained by the investigation we had conducted was submitted, accompanied by a request to be advised of any other or qualifying lucts in the possession of . he Chilian government that might tend to relieve this affair of the appearance of an insult to this government. The Chilian gov ernment was also advised that if such qualify ing facts did not exist this government would confidently expect full and prompt reparation. It is to be regretted that the reply of the sec retary lor foreign affairs of the provisional gov ernment was couched in an offensive tone. To this no response lias been made. This govern ment is now awaiting the result of an investiga tion which has been conducted by the criminal court at Valparaiso. It is reported unofficially that the Investigation is about completed, and It is expected that the result will soon be com municated to this government, together with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by which the attention of Chili was called to this incident. If these just expectations shonld be disappointed or further needless de lay intervene 1 will, by a special message, bring this matter again to the attention of Congress for such action as may be necessary. The en tire correspondence with the government of Chili will at an early day be submitted to Con gress. I renew the recommendation of my special message, dated January Iff, 1890, tor the adop tion of the necessary legislation to enable this government to ap>ply in the case of Sweden and Norway the same rule in respect to the levying of tonnage dues as was claimed and secured to the shipping of the United States in 1828, under article 8 of the treaty of 1827. The adjournment of the Senate without action on the pending acts for the sup pression of the slave traffic in Africa and for the reform of the revenue tariff of the independent state of the Congo left this government unable to exchange those acts on the dale fixed, July 2, 1891. A modus vivendi has been concluded by which the power of the Congo State to levy duties on imports is left un impaired, and, by agreement of all the signa tories to the general slave trade act, the time for the exchange of ratifications on the p.art of the United States has been extended to February 2, 1892. THE INTER-CONTINENTAL RAILWAY. Satisfactory Reports from Engineers in Charge of the Work. Surveys for the connecting links of the pro jected inter-continental railway are in progress, not only in Mexico, hut at various points along the course mapiped out. Three surveying par ties are now in the field under the direction of the commission. Nearly 1,000 miles of the pro posed road have been surveyed, including the most difficult part, that through Ecuador and the southern part of Columbia. The reports of the engineers are very satisfactory, and show that no insurmountable obstacles have been met with. On November 12, 1884, a treaty was concluded with Mexico reaffirming the bound ary between the two countries as described in the treaties of February 2, 1848, and De cember 80, 1853. March 1, 1889, a further treaty was negotiated to lacilitate the carrying out of the principles of the treaty of 1884, and to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the changes and alterations that take place from natural causes in the Kio Grande and Colorado rivers in the portion thereof con stituting the boundary line between the two re pmblics. The international boundary commis sion, provided for by the treaty of 1889. to have exclusive jurisdiction of any question that may arise, has been named by the Mexican govern ment. An appropriation is necessary to enable the United States to ftrfjjill its treaty obligation in this respiect. The death of King Kalakana in the United States afforded occasion to testify our friend ship for Hawaii by conveying the king’s body to his own land in a naval vessel, with all due honors. The government ol his successor, Queen Liliuokalani, is seeking to promote closer commercial relations with the United States, Surveys lor the much-needed sub-marine cable from our Pacific coast to Honolulu are in prog ress, and this enterprise should have the suit able promotion of the two governments. I strongly recommend that provision be made for improving the harbor of Pearl River and equipping it as a naval station. The arbitration treaty formulated by the In ternational American Conference lapsed by reason of the failure to exchange ratifications fully within the limit of time provided: but sev eral of the governments concerned have ex pressed a desire to save this important result of the conference by an extension of the period. It is. in my judgment, incumbent upon the United states to conserve the influential initia tive it has taken in this measure by ratifying the instrument and by advocating the pro posed extension of the time for exchange. These views have been made known to the other signatories. IMPORTANCE OF THE NICARAGUA CANAL. Plans for the Construction of the Great Waterway Are Explained. The annual report of the Maritime Canal Company, of Nicaragua, shows that much cost ly aud necessary preparatory work has been done during the year in the construction of shops, railroad tracks, and harbor piers and breakwaters, and that the work ot canal con struction nas made some progress. 1 deem it to be a matter of the highest con cern to the United States that this canal, con necting the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and giving to us a short water commun ication between our ports upon those two great seas, sfiould be speedily constructed, and at the smallest practicable limit of cost. The gain in freights to the people, and the direct saving to the government of the United States in the use of its naval vessels would pay the entire cost of this work within a short series of years. The report of the secretary of the navy shows the saving in our naval expenditures which would result. The senator from Alabama (Mr. Morgan), in his argument upon this subject before the rren ateatthe last session, did not over-estimate the importance of this work when he said that “the canal is \he most important subject now con nected with the commercial growth and prog ress of tbe*United Slates.” If this work is to be promoted by the usual financial methods and without the aid of this government, the expendi tures, in its interest-bearing securities and stocks, will probably be twice the actual cost. This will necessitate higher tolls and constitute a heavy and altogether needless burden upon our commerce and that of the world. Every dollar of the bonds and stock of the company should represent a dollar expanded in the le gitimate and economical prosecution of the work. This is only possible by giving to the bonds the guaranty of the United States govern ment. Such a guaranty would secure the ready sale at par of a 8 par cent, bond, from time to time, as the money was needed. Ido not doubt that, built upon these business methods, the canal would, when fully inaugurated, earn its fixed charges and operating expenses. But if its bonds are to te marketed at heavy discounts and every bon'd sold is to be accompanied by a gift of stock, as has come to be expected by in vestors in such enterprises, the traffic will be seriously burdened to pay interest and divi dends. lam quite willing to recommend gov ernment promotion in the prosecution of a work which, if no otter means offered for se curing the completion, is ot such transcendent interest that the government should, in my opinion, secure it by direct appropriations from its treasury. A guaranty of the bonds of the canal compa ny to an amount necessary to the completion of the canal could, I think, be so given as not to involve any serious risk of ultimate loss. The things to be carefully guarded are the comple tion of the work within the limits of the guar anty, the subrogation of the United States to the rights of the first mortgage bondholders for any amounts it may have to pay, and in the mean time a control of the stock of the company as a security against mismanagement and loss. I most sincerely nope that neither party nor sec tional lines will be drawn upon this great American project so full of interest to the peo ple of all our states, and so influential iu its ef fects upon the prestige and prosperity of our common country. EXPULSION OF JEWS FROM RUSSIA. Its Effects Upon Immigration to the United States Discussed. This government has found occasion to ex press, in a friendly spirit, but with much earn estness, to the government of the Czar its se rious concern because of the harsh measures now being enforced against the Heorews in Russia. By the revival of nnti-semitic laws, long in abeyance, great numbers of those un fortunate people have been constrained to aban don their homes and leave the empire by reason of the impossibility of finding subsistence within the pale to which it is sought to confine them. The immigration of these people to the United States—many other countries being closed to them —Is largely increasing, and is likely to assume proportions which may make it difficult to find homes and employm nt for them here, aud to seriously affect the lauor market. It is estimated that over 1,000,000 will be forced Irom Russia w ithin a lew years. The Hebrew is never a beggar: ho has always Kept the law—lived by toil—often under severe and oppressive civil re strictions. It is also true that no race, sect or class bus more fully cared for its own than the Hebrew race. But the sudden transfer ot such a multitude, under conditions that tend to strip them ot their small accumulations aud to tie press their energies and courage, is neither good for them nor lor us. The banishment, whether by direct decree or by not less certain indirect methods, of so large a number of men and women is not a local question. A decree to leave r, ne country is, in tne nature of things, an order to enter another, 'this consideration, as well as the suggestions of humanity, furnishes ample ground lor the re monstrances which we have presented to Russia, while our historic friendship for that government cannot fail to give the assurance that our representations are those of a sincere well-wisher. SLAVES ON OCEAN ISLANDS. The Navassa Incident Urges Legislation Favorable to Labor Interests. The Island of Navassa, in the West Indian group, has, under the provisions of Title 72, of the Revised Statutes, been recognized by the President as appertaining to the United States. It contains guano deposits, is owned by the Na vassa Phosphate Company, and occupied solely by its employes. In bepdember, 1889, a revolt took place among these laborers, resulting in the killing of some of the agents of the com pany, caused, as the laborers claimed, by cruel treatment. These men were arrested and tried in the United States court at Baltimore, under Section 5576, of the statute referred to, as if the offenses had been committed on board a mer chant vessel of the United States on the high seas. There appeared on the trial, and other wise came to me, such evidence of the bad treat ment of the men that in consideration of this and of the fact that the men liad no access to any public officer or tribunal for protection orthe redress of their wrongs, I commuted the death sentences that had been passed by the court up on three of them. In April last my attention was again called to this island, and to the un regulated condition of things there, by a letter from a colored laborer, who claimed that he was wrongfully detained upon the island by the phosphate company after the expnratiou of his contract of service. A naval vessel was sent to examine into the case of this man and generally into the condition of things on the island. It was foun J that the laborer referred to had been detained beyond the contract limit, and that a condition of re volt again existed among the laborers. A board of naval officers reported, among ether things, as follows; “We would desire to state further that the discipline maintained on the island seems to be that of a convict establish ment, without its comforts and cleanliness, and that, until more attention is paid to the ship ping of laborers, by placing it under govern ment supervision to prevent misunderstanding and misrepresentation, and until some ameliora tion is shown in the treatment of the laborers, these disorders will be of constant occurrence.” I recommend legislation that shall pdace labor contracts upon this snd other islands having the relation that Navassa has to the United States under th* supervision of a court commis sioner. and that shall provide, at the expense of the owners, an officer to reside upon the islands, with power to judge and adjust disputes, and to enforce a just and humane treatment of the employes. It is inexcusable that American laborers should be left within our own jurisdic tion without access to any government officer or tribunal lor their protection and the redress of their wrongs. International copyrignt has been secured, in accordance with the conditions of the act of March 8, 1891, with Belgium, France, Great Britain and the British possessions, and Switz erland, the laws of tffose countries permitting to our citizens the benefit of copyright on sub stantially the same basis as to their own citizens or subjects. With Germany a special conven tion has been negotiated upon this subject, which will bring that country within the recip rocal benefits ol our legislation. 

EFFECTS OF THE TARIFF BILL Shown in the Prosperity of the Country and the Condition of the Treasury, The general interest in the operations of the Treasury Department has been much augment ed during the last year by reason of the con flicting predictions which accompanied and followed the tariff and other legislation of the last Congress affecting the revenues, as to the results of this legislation upon the treasury and upon the country. On the one hand it was con tended that imports would so fall off as to leave the treasury bankrupt, and that the prices of articles entering into the living of the people would be so enhanced as to disastrous ly affect their comfort and happiness, while on the other it was argued that the loss to the revenue, largely the result of placing sugar on the free list, w ould be a direct gain to the people: that the prices of the necessaries of life. Including those most highly protected, would not be enhanced: that labor would haven larger market and the products of the farm advanced prices; whilethe treasury surplus and receipts would be adequate to meet the appropriations. Including the large exceptional expenditures for the refunding to the states of the direct tax and the redemption of the 4% Per cent, bonds. It is not my purpose to enter at any length into a discussion of the effects of the legislation to which 1 have referred; but a brief examina tion of the statistics of the treasury and a gen eral glance at the state ot business throughout the countrv will, 1 think, satisfy any impartial inquirer that its results have disappointed the evil prophesies of its opponents and in a large measure realized the hopeful predictions of its friends. Rarely, if ever before, in the history of the country has there been a time when the proceeds of one day’s labor or the product of one farmed acre would purchase so large an amount of those things that enter into the liv ing of the masses of the people. I believe that a full test will develop the tact that the tariff act of the Fifty-first (Jongre-s is very favorable in its average effect upon the jjrices of articles entering into common use. During the twelve months from October 1, 1890, to September SO, 1891, the total value of our foreign commerce (imports and exports com bined) was 81,747,806.406,’ which was The largest of any year in the history of the United States. The largest in any previous year w'as in 1890, when our commerce amounted to 81,647,189,098, and the last year exceeds this enormous aggre gate by over 8100,00 J,OOO. It is interesting, and to me somewhat surprising, to know that dur ing the year ending September 80. 1891, our im ports of merchandise amounted to 882-1,715,270, which was an increase of more than SIi.OuO.OOO over the value of the imports of the correspond ing months of the preceding year, when the im ports ot merchandise were unusually large iu anticipation of the tariff legislation then pend ing. The average annual value ot the imports of merchandise for the ten years from 1881 to 1890 was 8692,186,522, and during the year end ing September SO, 1891, this annual average was exceeded by 8132,528,469. The value of free imports during the twelve months ending September 80, 1891, was 8118,- 092,887 more than the value of free Imports dur ing the corresponding twelve months of the preceding year, and there was during the same period a decrease of 8106,846,508 in the value ot imports of dutiable merchandise. The rjercent age of merchandise admitted freeof duty during the year to which I have referred, the first un der * the new tariff, was 48.18. while dur ing the preceding twelve months, under the old tariff, the percentage was 84.27, an increase of 18.91 per cent. If we take the six mouths end ing September 80 last, which covers the time during w'hich sugars have been admitted free of duty, the per cent, of value of merchandise im ported free ot duty is found to be 55.37, which is a larger percentage of Iree imports than dur ing any prior fiscal year in the history of the government. If we turn to exports of merchandise the sta tistics are full of gratification. The value of such exports of merchandise for the twelve months ending September SO, 1891, was 8923.- 091,136, while for the corresponding previous twelve months it was 8860,177,115. an increase of 862,914.021, which is nearly three times the av erage annual increase of exports of merchan dise during any year iu the history of the gov ernment. The increase in the value of exports of agricultural products during the year re ferred to over the corresponding twelve months of the prior year was 845,846,197, while the in crease in the value of exports of manufactured products was 816,888,240. There is certainly nothing in the condition of trade, foreign or domestic, there is certainly nothing in the condition of our people of any class, to suggest that the existing tantt aud rev enue legislation bears oppressively upou the people or retards the commercial development of the nation. It may be argued that our condi tion would be better if our tariff legislation were upon a free trade basis; but it cannot be denied that all the conditions of prosperity and of general contentment are present iu a larger degree than ever before in our his-tury, and that, too, just when it was prophesied they would be iu the worst slate. Agitation for radical changes in tariff and financial legislation cannot help, but may seriously impede business, to the pros perity of which some degree of stability iu legis lation is essential. I think there are conclusive evidences that the new tariff' has created several great indus tries, which will within a lew years give em ployment to several hundred thousand Ameri can working men and women. In view of the somewhat overcrowded condition of the labor market of the United States, every patriotic citi zen should rejoice at s-ucb a result. 

DANGERS OF FREE COINAGE. President Harrison Takes h Hold Stand on the Silver Ouestion. The report of the secretary of the treasury shows that the total receipts of the govern ment, Irom all sources, for the fiscal year ending June 80. 1891, were 8458,514,288,08, while the ex penditures for the same period were $421,304,- 470.46, leaving a surplus ot 887,289,762.5". The receipts of the fiscal year euuiug Juue 80, 1892, actual and estimated, are 8433,000.00'* and the expenditures 8109,000,000. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, the estimated receipts are 8455,336,850 and the expenditures 8441,300,098. Under the law of July 14, 1890, the secretary of the treasury has purchased since August 13, during the fiscal year 48,393,113 ounces of silver bullion at an average cost of 81.045 per ounce. The highest price paid during the year was 81.2025, and the lowest 80.9636. In exchange for this silver bullion there have been issued 850,- 577,498 of the treasury notes authorized by the act. The lowest price of silver reached during the fiscal year was 50.9636 on April 22, 1891; but on November 1 the market price was only 80.96, which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74*4 cents. Before the influence of the prospective silver legislation was felt in the market silver was worth in New York about 80.955 per ounce. The ablest advocates of free coinage in the last Con gress were most confident in their prediction that the purchases oy the government required by the law would at once bring the price of sil ver to 81.2929 per ounce, which would make the bullion value of a dollar 100 cents, and bold it there. The prophecies of the anti-silver men of disasters to result from the coinage of 82,000,000 per month were not wider of the mark. The friends of free silver are not agreed, I think, t s to the causes that brought their hopeful predic tions to naught. Borne facts are known. The exports of silver from London to India during the first nine months of this calendar year fell off over 50 per cent., or 817,202,730, compared with the same months of the preceding year. The ex ports of domestic silver bullion from this coun try, which hod averaged for the last ten years ever 817,000,000, fell in the last fiscal year to 813,797,891; while, for the first time in recent years, the imports of sliver into this country exceeded the exports by the sum of 82,745,365. In the previous year the net exports of silver from the United States amounted to 88,545,455. The production of the United States increased from 50,000,000 ounces in 1889 to 51,500,000 in 1890. The government is now buying and put ting aside annually 54,000,000 ounces, which, al lowing for 7,340,000 ounces of new bullion used in the arts, is 6,640,000 more than our domestic product available for coinage. 1 hope the depression in the price of silver is temporary, and that a further trial of this legis lation will more favorably affect it. That the increased volume of currency thus supplied for the use ot the people was needed, and that bene ficial results upon trade and prices have fol lowed this legislation I think must be very clear to everyone; nor should it be forgotten that for every dollar of these notes issued a full dollar’s worth of sliver bullion is at the time deposited in the treasury as a security for its redemption. Upon this subject, as upon the tariff, my rec ommendation is that the existing laws be given a full trial, and that our business interests be spared the distressing influence which threats of radical chang< s always impart. Under exist ing legislation it is in the power of the Treasury Department tor aintain that essential condition of national finance as well as of commercial prosperity—the parity in use of the coin dollars and their paper representatives. The assurance that these powers would be freely and unhesi tatingly used has done much to produce and sustain the present favorable business con ditions. 1 am still rx the opinion that the free coinage of silver under existing conditions would dis astrously affect our business interests at home and abroad. We could not hope to maintain an equality in the purchasing power of the gold and silver dollar in our own markets, and in foreign trade the stamp gives no added value to the bullion contained in coins. The producers of the country, its ft rmers and laborers, have the highest interest that every dollar, paper or coin, issued by the government, shall be as good as any other. If there is one less valuable than another its sure and constant errand will he to pay them for their toil and for their crops. The money-lender will protect himself by stip ulating for payment in gold, but the laborer has never been able to do that. To place busi ness upon a silver basis would mean a sudden and severe contraction of the currency, by the withdrawal of gold and gold notes, and such an unsettling of all values as would produce a commercial panic. I cannot believe that a peo ple so strong and prosperous as ours will pro mote such a policy. The producers of silver are entitled to just consideration, but they should not forget that the government is now buying and putting out of the market what is the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mines. This is more than they themselves thought of asking two years ago. I believe it is the earnest desire of a great majority of the people, as it is mine, that a full coin use shall be made of silver just as soon as the co-operation of other nations can be secured and a rate fixed that will give circulation equally to gold and silver. The business of the world requires the use of both metals; but 1 do not see any prospect of gain, but much of loss, by giving up the present system, in which a full use is made of gold and a large use of silver, for one in which silver alone will circulate. Such an event would be at once fatal to the further progress of the silver movement. Bi-metallism is the desired end, and the true friends of silver will be care ful not to overrun the goal and bring in silver mono-metallism, with Its necessary attendants, the loss of our gold to Eurape, and the relief of the pressure there for a larger currency. I have endeavored by the use of official and un official agencies to keep a close observation of the state of public sentiment in Europe upon this question, and have not found it to be such as to justify me in proposing an international conference. There is. however, I am sure, a growing sentiment in Eurone in favor of a larger use of silver, and 1 know of no more effectual way of promoting this sentiment than by ac cumulating gold here, A scarcity of gold in the European reserves will be the most per suasive argument for the use of silver. The exports of gold to Europe, which began in February last and continued until the close of July, aggregated over 870,000,000. The net loss ot gold during the fiscal year was nearly 868.000,000. That no serious monetary disturb ance resulted was most gratifying, and gave to Europe fresh evidence of the strength and stability of our financial institutions. With the movement of crops the outflow of gold was speedily stopped, and a return set in. Up to December 1 we had recovered of our gold loss at the port of New York 827,854,000. and it is confidently believed that during the wilder and spring this aggregate will be steadily and large ly increased.
