I desire to have I incorporated in the resolutions the; following : I "That so much of said message and . documents as relates to the allowance, bv the tfuartermastor General of Iclaims for quartermaster's storesta-; ' ken during the war ho referred to a , i special committee of five members. | We are all aware that in the her-- I der States during the war (here was; great loss and damage inflicted bv the; takingof quartermaster's stores in an i informal manner. The law upon that' 'subject now is entirely inadequate. I | had the honor to introduce a hill hire-! igard to it. on which (his House has! j not vet taken action. That hill has I for its object the relief of a large num ber o| our citizens. Inconsequence! of the exigencies of the war, quarter : master's stores were taken. Damage ! was inflicted on eiti/.ens for the bene-; : ill of the Army, the Army enjoyed thej ; benefit of it, and yet there is no title-! iqiiato provision for the relief of those! [on whom that damage was indicted. I While claims amount to several j | million dollars, the Cuarternia-tei j General lias up to this date allowed! j hut the amount of ■'fidtiT.tinn. The i articles taken Were necessary for the ; comfort of the Army, and one can i lead l l v realize what must have been i the necessities of the armies for lll slanee led hv (telieral Meade ami General Me (Tellan in their hurried campaigns through the western por tions of the Stale of Maryland. Those armies were in want of mans supplies, and the eampingof the Anus i fora night devastated and destroyed farms which the day before were pie " tures of plenty. 1 ask that this committee shall take | this subject into consideration. This [Congress has already made provision 1 j look ng io the adjuslmen. of elainis j similar in their character in (lie .Si.-ile.- ! that seceded. Ido not know why a, i discrimination, for such it praetieaiiv i is, should ho made against those State.-. jlliatdid not withdraw from tin I nion This whole subject ought to he consul i Bred. Justice shou.d he done, espeei [ally as the Secretary of War has re commended that Congress shall limit i the time wit bin which these claims shal 1 ho presented. I ask, then, Mr. Ciiaii-! man, that the gentleman from Massa- ' j ehusetts will include in his resolutions q a reference ot this subject to a -select committee of five to take the whole' : matter into consideration: otherwise 1 j shall press my amendment. Mr. DAWES. This whole matter is; i now before the committee of (Tunis , and it seems to that that is the legiti mate committee to consider the ques- i lion. 1 hope the gentleman from Maryland will consent to let it remain with that committee. They are al-| 1 ready considering the question. The I proposition to raise a southern claim*, j ' commission came from that committee, | land they are considering the whole| ; matter at the present lime. It seems ; hardly proper to create a special com- 1 | mitteo to take tins branch of the sub- i Iject from them. Mr.
