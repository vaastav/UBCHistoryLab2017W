Business Sentiment for Reiteeetty. The New York chamber of commerce is divided on the subject of reciprocity. A part of the membership sustains the ac tion of the reciprocity convention recently held in this city, while another part rejects it, holding that while the convention de clared in favor of reciprocity. It did so in terms that make such a policy Impossible. The friends of reciprocity have presented the following resolutions. and they will be debated at an early meeting of the cham her: "Resolved. That this chamber expresses its disapproval of the action taken by the national reciprocity convention at Wash ington on the 20th ultimo as subversive of all attempts to bring about closer trade re lations with our sister nations and to open new and wider markets for our products; and be it further -Resolved, That the chamber views with apprehension the oolicy advocated by the reciprocity convention as likely to invite hostile legislation on the part of the other nations against this count-y to the great detriment of its commercial Interests." Why should not this action be copied by the chambers of commerce throughout the country? Why not ascertain in that way just how strong business sentiment in the United States is in favor of reciprocity? The convention held in this city was com posed almost exclusively of manufactur ers whose industries have been built up by the policy of protection. They were able men, and familiar with the subject from the viewpoint of their personal interests. And naturally they expressed themselvee from that viewpoint. But they did not close the debate. There is another side to the question, as these New York resolu tions show, and it should be fully and frankly presented by a united effort on the part of all business men who hold it. There Is plenty of time for th's. Con gress has just taken down the shutters. and-the shop is likely to remain open for at least seven months. Just now we are bearing the prediction somewhat cnnfident ly made that nothing of any kind respect ing the tariff will be done at this session. The reciprocity treatles negotiated by Mr. Kasson are dead. New ones to take their place will not be ordered. The ways and means committee of the House will give the tariff a wide berth. And so on. It all ecpends. The cockiest of the gentlemen holding this tone is not beyond the reach of public opinion resolutely and adequately expressed. If there is a demand for rec' procity and for the abolition of tariff duties which have ceased to be a protec tion for infant industries and are now a bounty for giants, they may be obtained. Let us hear from the chambers of com merce, and boards of trade. and all those manufacturers who do not subscribe to the double shuffle on the subject of reciprocity executed here last month. Mr. McKinley thought someth!ng should be done. Mr. Roosevelt is of a like opinion. There is no lack of leadership in Congress. In either H11ause may be found republicans willing to make the fght for free trade, and who think It may be done, and the fight woh, without injury to any branch of American industry. Locating Pubie Buildings. The reported agreement between the members of the park commission and the Attorney General not to proceed with the new Department of Justice building on the site chosen by Congress is in line with'the general desire of those who hopo to see Washington develop evenly and satisfac torily as a capital. The location of this building upon the small site prepared for it would throw it out of harmony with the group of structures south of it. It would have no reference to any broad plan, and would forever stand as a monument to the government's inconsiderate haste and economy. The reasons for haste were removed when Congress authorized the abandon inent of the ramshackle reedmnen's- Bu reau building, which had come within an ace of collapse under the pressure of heavy occupancy. There is every reason why this structure, which should be one of the finest of the whole series of depart mental buIldings, should be placed with reference to the proposed plan of public improvernents soon to be outlined to. the Senate. There will be anmple room within the great avenue-Mall triangle, which It is proposed to add to the reservation, for this and many other buildings. It may be easily placed there within a short distance of the White House. The public building scheme must be con sidered now In its broadest aspect in order to insure the most satisfactory results. Piece-meal site selection will never pro duce the results required by the character of the city. A comprehensive plan ot site prov-ision, such as the Inclusion of the great triangle within the Mall. is the only assured manner of preventing lapses in the future from the central p~roject of provid ing for the government's needs. There are enough badly placed buildings now in service to warn Congress of the folly of depending upon the impulse of the hour to guide the authorities in their choice of sites. I 6* Presidient Roosevelt's willingness to get general ir.formnation wherever he can find it will have a tendency to discourage the peo ple who sometimes think they can forecast the stock market by inspecting the White House visiting list. The Chinese may as well submnit grace fully to being kept out. But they have a perfect right to register emphatic objection to being classed as anarchists.. Leemotles and Electrie Motors. At a recent memion of .the American So iety of Mechanical Engineers experts pre sented statistics showing that the running of express and limited trains on the steam raliroads has increased the cost of oper ating locomotive, from about 81 to $2 a mile, while at the same timne adding mna terially to the responsibilities of managers. The peiaiese to of the added cost are fuel ennmsmpties, ser ad tear, brakg to machimery. Injury to track, delay to other trains-to gIte a cear track' and sc eidents. Nevertheless the demand for rapid travel between cities Is se ianistent that the steafas poliey of the railroad. is to., iay to increas both the speed of sya grains whserever pesil and the nmbe of such traits.

The question of relative cost of so tual operation is for theUrsad experts to determine, yet it Is appieet that if the demand for hgh-s d traew oanntine to Increase as at present the general locomo tive cost will soon be so great that corpora tions will be itsilug to admit the economy of large electris powewtplants for the opera tion of motors to carry this special servkie.

The present Ideal of long-distance traction involves the employment of electric motors. doing away with noise and smoke. The adoption of the motor on the New York elevated roads has materially advanced the movement to this end and perhaps In the light of this latest showing of locomotive costs the railroad owners of the country may see their way clear to a gradual amendment of their motive power depart ments in favor of the more moderh appa ratus. I~ I "Sobering Efeets of 0.0ee." It is observed In quarters nbt heretofore friendly to Mr. Roosevelt that he is already showing in the presidency the sobering ef fects of high dffcal responsibility. His message is described as a surprise because of its conservative tone. There seems to have been the expectation of a document bristling with aggressiveness' toward the outside world, and threatening the turning up of Jack here at home. But really, upon what was this expectation founded? Upon Mr. Roosevelt's record as civil ser vice commissioner? He did nothing reck less in that office, but much that was wise and for the good of the cause. Upon his record as police commissioner in New York? He shook up- the force there from top to bottom, but it was universally ad mitted that he did his work admirably, and that the city and the force itself greatly benefited. When he went to the Navy De partment it, was freely predicted that he and Mr. Long would pull together at, the furthest about a month. The one was rep resented as all impetuousness and imprac ticability. and the other alf soberness and calculation. The two men got along like brothers, and. the Secretary surrendered his assistant to the army with the greatest re luctance. When Mr. Roosbvelt put on his shoulderstraps, there were those who shud dered for hii regiment and his superior officer. They did not .doubt that there would be a mutiny In camp, and that the second In command of the Rough Riders would head it. He,.proved instead a good soldier, and was both brave and efficient. Why then this comment, as if a wild man had entered the White House two months ago and been tamed there? As a matter of fact, Is not the change in his critics, and not in Mr. Roosevelt? He has always been an aggressive man, out of the ordi nary in hfs carriage and methods, and this has invited speculation and no little cari cature. It has grown to be a custom to refer to him as a fighter, always on the b --I- ova "biling. for a row. Much of this was simply good fooling by the car toonists and the newspaper paragraphers, and some of .hem handled their topic in a way that even Mr. Roosevelt himself must have enjoyed. But it was no more than that. and the joke is on those who took it all seriously, and are now drawink their first breath of comfort since Mr. Roosevelt became President upon finding that he Is not disposed to use his office as would a cowboy; and set out with his revolver drawn to "smoke" the United States. This comment. however, is a good sign, as It. shows that even the most bitterly prejudiced of the President's former critics know 1.man when they get the proper line on him, and are willing to give him credit when they think he deserves It. Anti-Aaarehium. Measures. There, Is certainty of the presentation of a great number and variety of suggestions regarding the best meana of carrying out the President's recommendation that the reds be excluded from this country. Al ready fully a dozen bills have been intro duced in Congress proposing one or another remedy for the evil. Probably many more will be offered before the session is well under way. These bills will follow the same general line of providing against the acceptance of immigrants who are known or suspected to entertain anarchistic sen timents. They will differ chiefly in the manner In which the government is to as certain the precise nature of the applicant's sociological views and in the degree in which the expulsion of. anarchists already here is authorized. Out of this mass of suggestion ought to come a strong measure of self-protection. It Is one of the first dtities of Congress at this session. Even if the President had not spoken so pointedly and. Impressively upon this toplc, the public sentimeot In favor of a tightening of the lines at the ports of entry would have requred.that the matter be taken up at the outset of the session and pressed to a'satisfactory conclusion. There can be no outspoken opposition to the principle involved in any of these bills. The argument lies along the lines of the best. means to the end. it is assured .that there will be no- more than a reasonable de lay in the formulation and -enactment of the bill which wiui result from the various propositions now pending or being framed for presentation. It is said' that there is enough applejack in New Jersey to- give every voter-five sal ions. This fact may be what makes som* of the anarchists in Paterson so Indignant about the manner in which wealth is dis tributed. General Coxey also had an .original idea about providing money for the masses. But he was shrewd enough to drop It when the audience got tired. One of the most important questions Con gross .will have to decide is what urgent questions will be given precedence" of other pressing questionms.
