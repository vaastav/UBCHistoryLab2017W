TWO CENTS, PRESIDENT CALLS FOR WAR AGAINST AUSTRIA Does Not Recommend a Declaration Against Turkey or Bulgaria at This Time, Because They Do not as Yet Stand in the Path of the United States in Fight Against Prussian Autocracy. 

NOTHING 10 TURN 0. S. ASIDE UNTIL WAR IS IN, GERMANY BEATEN Autocracy Must Be Taught Its Final and Convincing Les son, and People of the World Put in Control of Their Own Destinies Peace Only to Be Discussed When (ierman People Have Spokesmen We Can Believe. WASHINGTON, Dee. 4. President Wilson in his message to congress today recommended a declaration of war against Austria. He did not, however, recommend a declaration against Turkey or Bulgaria at this time. Immediate war against Austria, the President told congress, was necessary to meet the anomalous situation the United States faces in its war with Germany even though Austria was not her own mistress and merely a vassal of Germany. The same logic, he said, would lead to war against Turkey and Bulgaria, but they do not yet, he said, stand in the path of the United States in its war against autocracy. In ringing, definite terms the President declared that nothing shall turn the United States aside until the war is won and Germany is beaten. All talk of peace, he pronounced out of the question. The President spoke as follows: iinpatioi.t inn mev win in- equally im patient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are .ip.il what we are planning for in seek ing to make conquest 'of peace by arms. 1 believe that 1 speak for them when I say two things: First, that this intolerable thing of which the masters of Cermany have shewn us the ugly face, this menace of combined intrigue and force which we now see so clearly as the (Iermany pow er a thing without conscience or hon or or capacity for covenanted peace j must be crushed and if it be not utterly; brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of nations. Second, that when this thing and its power are indeed defeated and the time comes t hat we can discuss peace when the (Jerman people have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the basis of law and of covenaiit for the life of the world we shall be willing ami glad to pay the full price for peace and pay it ungrudgingly. We know what that peace will be. It will be full, impartial justice justice done at .every point and to every na tion that the final settlement must af fect, o'er enemy as well as our friends. Yen catch with me the voices of hu manity that are in the air. They grow daily move audible, more articulate, mere jei uasive and they come from the heart of men everywhere. Thcv insist that the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind, yet no nations or peoples shall be rubbed or punished because the in esponsible nil eis of a single country have themselves hoi. deep and abominable wrong. It is this thought that has been oppressed in the formula "no annexation, 110 lcM ibutioi). no punitive indemnities." TO

Informal complaints, however, have been made to the various members of the committee, most of President's Message Published Sim ultaneously in Europe and Asia. 

WASHINGTON, Dee. 4 .--The in ternational character of President Wilson 'h address which was deliv ered to congress at PJ.oO today is indicated by the fact that the gov ernment already has placed it for simultaneous publication in practi cally every capital in the world. Although the address was not en trusted in advance to American new papers or news distributing as sociations it already has been placed with the London office of Router's, the principal Kuropenn news dis tributing agency, which in turn is to supply others in -Europe. Indi rectly the address will get to Berlin and the other Central Powers capi tals. Its world-wide distribution is also evidenced by the fact that it will be available for publication to day in China and Japan.

Dealeis in wood who have accepted orders for wood and have not made delivery are urgently requested to deliver the w f-od at once if it is possible to do so. It is ja patriotic duty to conserve fuel as I much as possible and to supj ly fud to j others as far as possible. Any farmers i who have wood to sell are asked to re jpoit to the committee; it is not likely ; t hat the New Kngland fuel administra tor will periiait the price of wood to be i increased over what it is selling for to day, and every bit of available wood should be used to save coal. Dealers should also be particular to deliver 12s cubic feet to the cord of four-foot wood or sawed wood; split wood will average about W cubic feet and loose wood about 14' cubic feet. Consumers should see to it that wood bought by the cord is full measure; if bought by the "load"' there is no standard size of load. The committee will recommend prices j f or fuel to the state fuel administrator, who will make reports to the Acw 1 Vita In ,1,1 fuel rol in i n ist l.'i t or :it Hoston Vermont v n.vi uho jix t!0 ,.jc(,s for p.rattleboro board of trade of. j n!j vi(.initVi anJ whcn tiese prices monev was ui- , 1,,,,.,, f -e, no . e;i er Mil lecr.n v soll at a higher price. As soou as the p.rices have been determinetl for this locality, they will be published in The Kefornier and The Vermont Phoenix. It is hoped that everyone who actual ly needs coal can be supplied, and if any person is unable to get coal in this ter ritory he should report the facts at once to a member of the fuel com mittee. The coal shortage, however, has (.nly just begun, and even those who have plenty of coal to last through the winter ought to save every pound possible toward supplying next win ter's needs. Not only is more coal go ing to be used because of the war, but the supply of cars to deliver the coal is likely to be less rather than greater from now on. There is still a scarcity of sugar in Prattltboro, but relief is said to be in eight and belief is expres-vd that bv the middle o next week there will be a supply for everyone. Some of the retail stores have no sugar on hand today while others are able to furnish small portions to their legular customers. The IeVitt Croeciy Co. takes) an op timistic vio-w of the situation, Mr. De Witt stating that a shipment will be received tomorrow which will be suf- licient to last the rest of this week, that more will be coming in Friday or Saturday and that by the middle of next week there will be a good sup !'l.v- From the sliipments tomorrow and the la -7 of the week all of th stores w ill get a little.

K.

The coniini.--sioii denied the application of western railroads to raise the commodity rate on iron and steel in western territory and from points ea.-t of the Mississip pi to t:i west, but allowed the filing of rates slightly higher than those maintained at p resent. The increases allowed on iion and steel articles in Sales) Co. in the pavilion this forenoon.

In addition to the large number of subscriptions' received during the past week ''to help Alcartra help," Mr. Walker received four subscriptions in lots. Two $10 subscriptions were quickly made and a large number at v" each so that the total of Mr. Walk-. . r's efforts reached .240. Four young ladies) drcssvd in Red Cross uniforms also gathered in many smaller amounts by circulating among the crowd. Governor Keyes of New Hampshire, who is attending the sale, was a generou contributor to the Red Lross ellorts.
