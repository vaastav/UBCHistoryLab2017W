THE NORTHERN. TRIBUNE. DECEMBER 15, 1S3; Northern Tribune. SATURDAY. DECEMBER lu. IS83. THE LIMIITillEAD. The tone In dealing with matters of piblie Interest is at once respectful and vigorous. Personality is disappearing, and rudeness is only a remembrance. Much better is social life in this change, and the tendency in leading political subjects characterizes the press of our day with more of tolerance and less hatred. There may be exceptions but they are growing less The rule is that passion is rapidly supplanted by a spirit of enquiry, and things are discussed. Hot only with fairness, but with a spirit of courage hi seeking truth. The fruits of this rapidlj growing opinion will in crease the happiness of communities. There being no room to indulge in vul garity, the mind In takin a.i opposite direction, will incline more to reason and morality. Once establish the les sons of truth, and what is known as evil will have no lodgement to disturb and to worry. The present is full of fine promise in the love of ethical culture, and however regarded, It cannot fall to Inspire the lovers of our race with the hope that a better day is ahead. The now, and the future are golden with geod. Take courage to look ahead. Edu cation is not schooling those beyond the teens, it is self control. It is in the power of every soul to make its own self. That inner self is the teacher. Do not worry about others; see to your own mind that it is right; the world will be the better and the individual happi ness assured. In no other di reetion can the hopes of mankind be fulfilled. The conditions are never wanting in sowing within thoughts that are manly and womanly. The excuse that hard work or poverty it in the way is not rational. Under all circumstances try to be a man or a woman. This Is education in its best sense. It is within the power of all. Tllti lll&TOIll' OF 

TA-DAT, The stewardship of the Republican party in twenty-tthree eventful years is one of the unique facts in history. It is the history of this republic In a crisis marking its transition from divided into homogeneous sovereignty. The perils it has tided over are not anywhere , par allied1. The w-onderfal drama happily ended after the honostest and fiercest struggle the world has seon, and victors and vanquished meet together in peace ful debate, not ou reprisals, or savage declaration, but amongst other thiug.s to adjust our surplus revenue. Europe is full of wonder at so extra ordinary a fact, and amazed at the re sources as well as the economy of our people. Everything in assured tran quility, the people everywhere busy with their own pursuits. The government .busy in squaring itself for judgement. The fact is marvelous, aad only the 'familiarity in realizing the constant fruits of wisely administed popular gov ernment it is difficult to state the fact, without apparent color of romance. But fact it is, a fact we all know, a fact familiar to us re our meals. "JSurplu$ revenue," when it was as serted a few years since that our debt was so large that its payment was im possible for generations. Gen. Morgan and Sam Carey, of Ohio, neither deficient in wit, but both of advanced Intelli gence, called forth strong, leanings in certain quarters by the force of these assertions. The Greenback party had much of its popularity and life from the assumed reasons of those views. . They were evanescent as time shows. The Democratic party has frequently assert ed its faith in the debt killing the na tion that was too mueh for secession and treason. But the nation has not staggered un der her lead. She has encountered hard ships, but the earnestness of our peo ple over-matched them. All the dread of our national debt Is luckily over. The fears by many honest men ' that the re public was in U trial are dissipated. The past calls up no specters. . The country is at ease. There are hardships incident to industrial overtrading, but the country is sound to the core. What would we have more. It is in our hearts to be just and honest, and viewing the present with the calm confidence that peace and Industry throw in upon us, the future can only inspire us. - All this has been the work of the Re publican party. For another steward ship of four years of the government of these states that sho has guarded so well amid strife.as in peace, the party is pro pared to go before the country for its yerdict against all comers. The Repub lican party is neither afraid, nor does it hesitate to declare upon a policy that will defend the honor of tbo country, the industry of the people, and at the same time meet their houest convic tions. The government is based upon popular conviction, and by that the Re publican party desires to be judged. 

PRESIDENT1 JUEIMJIGE. The President's message is a new de parture in some respects. There is nothing in it for mere effect.it is simply in the shape of a recommendation. The facts are all there, and the suggestions are for the country. The message is everywhere read now, but the following suggestions are siguificant, and will be interesting, as necessarily wound up in tbo future action of parties. The basis of banking to be a remission of the tax on circulation, and issue notes equal to ninety per cent, of the market value of the bonds deposited. This displaces the common idea of long time bonds. The trade ddllars are to be withdrawn, and a payment in excess allowed for them at the mint. The coast de'ense and torpe do system with the care for the navy are recommended. The state and uational militia should be united. lie is opposed to a national telegraph, but favors interstate regu lation. The railroads, he lets them alone. Primary education in the south finds countenance. He favors civil ser vice and takes pride in it. The Utah difficulty he deals with as the Tribune suggested in the last issne. He favors Congress fixing beyond doubt the Presidential succession, and suggests a substitute for the civil rights bill lately pronounced unconstitutional. The President in this message guages the popular snstinets in their love for fair dealing. The message is clear, and Arthur is away up in the solid judg ment of the country, as a fine man and a faithful and sound President. Count Van Moltke is losing his mind. Hendricks off for E urope, uud Tllden clean off forever. Kansas City claims to be the largest mule Emporium in the world, outside the Democratic party. Arthur W. Peel Is the speaker of the English Honse of Commons.h'e is the yonngest eon of the late Sir Robert Peel. General Slocum is Fitz John Porter's advocate in Congress, and we all know Porter's restoration has been slow to come. It raised Russia's debt $15,000,000 more to erown the Czar, Republics should be thankful they are out of the crowning business. Charles A. Mathews a youi.g and wealthy petroleum broker of New York city, saicided because he lost all he had at the card table. The United States government is a partner to the lecherous infamy of pol igamyas long us it permits the vile tiling to exirt. Destroy it. Mrs, Langtry lost a dog named Nel lie, a large King Charles spaniel, but Freddy Gebhardt still lives, which dis proves the survival of the fittiest. in the state of Oregon, and the terri tories of Wyoming and Utah, womeu can vote, aad in eyery state and territory there are women asking for suffrage. The Inter Ocean says Illinois is turn ing out 13.000 gallons of whicjey more each day, than last year, owing to the "off" year Democratic boom. We never heard of that party being "off" on whis ky. The obscene publisher thinks, "If I don't do it some one will, the people want low, vulgar things, and I Intend to supply them through my paper." The scallawag is much mistaken in his esti mate of what people want. , ' O'Donnell, who killed the informer Carey is to be hanged in Newgate oa the 17th of December. There was much sym pathy for the man and an effort will be made to have the sentence commnted but in all probability the man will hang. Sunset Cpx has announced himself as candidate for speaker next time, he thinks If he had bogun early and given some time to working np his boom, he would have had a chance; anyhow he is a true Demociat, and is a standidate for office as long as life lasts. The temperance question will not down, as is seen in tho vigorous prosecu tion of the traffic under the local option in several southern states, and, the suc cess obtained. The darkies fa.ror swear ing off and cleaning: the business out in South and North Carolina, Georgia and other states. The Chinese question will apply to congress. Congress is full of ideas but it is hard to place them. Bonanza MacKay Is succeeding with his telegraph after all. Hyacinth's lecture in N8W York drew only a handful of people. Coming Christmas cards are of de signs more artistic than ever before. A Chicago banker suggests a deposit of coin instead of bonds for notes of issue. Dr. Talmage has pronounced an Irish potato orthodox but that dont prevent it from being good. Boston gave Matthew Arnold a bum per and eo will Cheboygan if he puts in appearance here. That great confidence man, Oscar Wilde has really secured some woman to consent to marry him. The Burth'ddi statue fund fair was declared open by Gen. Grant. He was the plainest looking man in the crowd. The New Orleans Times Democrat, ob jects to the reduction tariff on sugar and yet Democrats elected a free trade speak er. A California medium says President Lincoln Is out of humor with the two ceut stamp. It seems-to have deranged the postal service "over there." Jeff Davis history of the war has not been a financial success. We be lieve this is not the first time this life long Democrat has not succedod in his schemes. At Holly, Mich., an improvised theatri cal company from another place played "Getting square with the barber," but it didn't square with the taste of the crowd. Ths actors sloped through the back doors. Carlislg will make a good speaker a better one for Republicans than Demo crats unless the man posesses superhu man sagacity to conquer breakers.a thing tlat does not seem to exist with any of the Democrat leaders.' ' g Danville is in Virginia, and Belfast is in Ireland. Bull-dozing any new de parture is popular on both sides of the water. The north will see that freedom means peace to anybody and everybody. It means this republic is tree, Tyack, Doe & Co., of Danville, Va, advertises for fire-arms loaned individu al and firms to shoot niggers just be fore the election. . They think they may have use for these .weapons, as the Pres idential election is future. The Democratic party will be forced to fight on the platform, tariff for rev en ue only, and will have the fight only, without any revenue, save the candi date's barrel, and the infernal revenue running from pplgot and bung hole of the traditional dogmatie barrel, The President, in reply to the delega tion of Congressmen and others who called on him for interposition in be half of Patrick O.Donnell, has cabled to Minister Lowell to use his good offices for commutation of his sentence. : What the effect will be remains to be seen. The Detroit Daily Times; is in its second week. It is full of news and np In telegrams. Tho editorials embrace every subject ol interest. They are pithy, have grasp, making it one of the readible papers of the day. Its inde pendent spirit is notable. It epitomeses nearly all the features of advanced jour nalism. Republicans do cot nominate a ticket in Charleston, S. C, but many Demo crats dissatisfied with matters propose an independent ticket, and are reminded by the News and Courier that if they take such a tep, they and their sup porters can receive no consideration from the party, and they must take con sequences. Tho choice in the po'ith is between Democracy straight or tho bowie-knife straight. Miss Jennie Smith, a suffering Inva lid for over sixteen years, was restored, as 6he verily believes, la answer to prayer, through the interposition of Deity. She is an Evangelist of remark able faith, enthusiasm and success. She is attracting , considerable interest among Christians and others. . For all the good that is done in this world by whatever means, the true lover of, good will bo thankful for good's sake. THE OLD M CifflKiJPKIS! Canned Goods of- all kinds. X . 

FIRST CLASS BUTTER k SPECIALTY. All I ask is a trial of my Goods and Prices. In Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia the Democrats have adopted the shot gun policy, and they couflJently expect a solid south. Frank II urd, the Toledo, Ohio, free trader is on the war path. The Demo cracy grunts, and young Maybury flour ishes his war club too. The wigwam is not melodious. Europe is full of wonder at the Presi dent's message in its allusions to our surplus revenue. The republic U solid aud Europe i shaky. The cause is the people rule here. The Detroit preachers are worrying on the style of discourse for the unregeaer ate. To tackle the agnostic braia is a de parture. The pulpit yet may become a school for philosophy and culture. A Kentucky blue-grass belle says that for her part she hasen't the slightest cu riosity to hear Mr Arnold lecture, and she doesn't see how the traitor can have the face to stand np before the Amei lean people. Cincinnati Saturday Night. The Detroit Evening Journal is im proving the quality of its work decided ly, and puts a lucidity ia its articles which, coupled with the fairness of ;the paper, cannot bat succeed. It seems determined to maintain able, breezy, go ahead journalism, squaring itself ou the rightfulness of all questions. Here is what Carlisle, the Democratic Speaker said in a speech after tlft war: "I deny that the United States is a na tion. It is a vieious system that has destroyed sovereign states and oppressed nine millions of people in the south. If a state 1ms no right of secession she cer tainly has the right of revolution." Modern thought is freighted with a sense of justice, fairness and charity, that demands a pure, dignified, honest tone in the newspaper. Those who carry the virus of moral small-pox in their columns to poison the public, are simply offensive to ail correet taste, while those who contribute better forms of thought and action to aid humanity to struggle successfully through the environments of earth' are soaght for. The Democrats who oppose opening the tariff issue propose to sweep the coun ry with a no issue position, on the basis that if they keep their mouth shut peo ple conclude them wise. But the people will want a party sensible and brave enough to avow and sustain a correct principle, and. the Republican party is famous for doing this every time and in tne right place. The would-bo free trade Republican sheets show their insincerity In criticiz ing and lampooning Carlisle as speaker. If these papers were honest they would rejoico in tho free , trade success that places Carlisle where he Is, because a good principle is just as valuable in the hands of a Democrat as in the trust of a Republican, but at heart they know free trade is ruinous, and the only safety of the country is in the continuance of the present policy of protection. The Russian treatment of its politi cal prisoners is so cruel that it is a pit v such a government should exist. Many of those unfortunates have suici ded. Ono woman is eyer on the watch of the rats from devouring her babe. The diet is such as makes life a torment. Prisoners rot away, and the survivors breathe the odor. 'A Taris writer pays those who refuse to answer questions are tortured, and women are violated. Civilization demands the destruction of uulocracy. 

RELIABLE. Washington is the scene of many un-v comely strifes for loaves aud fishes. The Bourbons of Virginia have by fair words made the impression that they were in favor of paying the etate debt to the last cent. Never was any thing more untrue. They never made any provisions to pay it, and didn't even pay the Interest. The readjustee step ped In and provided for paying the debt, scaling it however. The readjust ee aro besides pronounced in their na tional tendencies. It is the union of the south in heart and head with the north, readjustment in Virginia means this. The bull-dozing and shot-gun policy has no place in their party. The bourbons have monopolized the bloody business. The Tribune has maintained the in wrought potentiality of Butlerism head ing towards the Presidency, beut ou wrecking Democracy if it dares snub him. Rufus H.Phinney, president of the working men of Lynn, has started the ball rolling in an address, that strikes terror to the shrivelled Democratic heart. Butler will go into the Democratic con vention, as John Kelly went, into the Cincinnati convention to rule or ruin. Heading the workingmeus' party, get ting the Tammany chief on the labor ticket, also Chalmers and Mahone, and all Independents committed to its sup port, the lur will fly and hides will be" tanned in modern style, but they wjll not be Republican hides. The following is a part of the stormy petrel's address referred to: "Organize the national workingmens' party. Organize the party in the several states; after organ izing the states call a national ; conven tion to be held ih the most central part of the country; there organize the na tional party, unfurl the banner of labor, place in nomination your candidates for President and VicVPresident, and, after nominating every officer down to the bottom of your ticket, call to your, sup port the friends of labor irrespective of party. Then put your shoulders to the wheel and elect every one of them. The EtJYEnV Guide, Nu. 34.
