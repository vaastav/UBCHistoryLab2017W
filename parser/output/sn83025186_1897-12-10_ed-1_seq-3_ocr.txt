The extra session of this congress, which closed July last, enacted Important legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized, what it b*s already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be required and the peo ple. satisfied with its operation and re sults thus far, are In no mind to with hold from it a fair trial. Finance Question West. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of congress, the ques tion next pressing for consideration Is that of the currency. The work of put ting our finance upon a sound basis, dif ficult as it may seem, will appear easily when we recall the financial operations of the government since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year we had out standing demand liabilities in the sum of 1728,868,447.41. On the 1st of January, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to $443, 889,495.83. Of our interest-bearing obliga tions the figures are even mor* striking. On July 1, 1866, the principal or the inter est-bearing debt of the government was 12,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July. 1W3, this sum had been reduced to $685,037,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The interest-bearing debt of the United States on the 1st day of December, 3807, was $847,365,620. The government monej now outstanding (December 1) consists of $346,681,016.of United States notes, $107,793, 280 of treasury notes, issued by authority of the law of 1890: $384,963,503 of silver cer tificates and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars. With the great resources of the govern ment and with the honorable example of the past before us, we ought not to hes itate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and re lieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 1893 makes unreasonable and ground less any distrust either of our financial ability or soundness while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish congress of the Immediate necessity of so legis lating as to make the return of the con ditions then prevailing Impossible. Many Flans Are Proposed. There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we can find the true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good good because the govern ment's pledge is out to keep it so. and that pledge will not be broken. How ever, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by advancing toward Its fulfillment. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the government of main taining the parity of our different forms of money—that is, keeping all of them at par with gold. We surely cannot be longer heedless of the burden this im- prosperous conditions, while the last four years have demonstrated that it Is not only an expensive charge upon the gov ernment, but a dangerous menace to the national credit It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the gov ernment against bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our de mand obligations, or increase the gold re nerve for their redemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the govern ment by solemn enactment has under taken to keep at par with gold. Nobody Is obliged to redeem in gold but the gov ernment The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The government is obliged to keep equal with gold all its outstand ing currency and coin obligations, while Its receipts are not required to be paid in gold. They arc paid 'in every kind of money but gold, and the only means by which the government can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. The govern ment without any fixed gold revenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done, and which under the authority now given it will continue to do. (iold Mast Be Beplenhhed. The law which requires the government after having redeemed its United States notes to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant replenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so in times of business panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government. At such times the government has no other way to supply its deficit and maintain redemp tion but through the increase of Its bond ed debt, as during the administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of four and a half per cent bonds were issued and sold and the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the government in excess of the revenues and sustain the gold reserve. While it is true that the greater part of the proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient revenue, a considerable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve. With our revenues equal to our expenses there would be no deficit re quiring the issuance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how will it be replenished except by Belling more bonds? Is there any other way practicable under existing law? The seri ous question then is, shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past—that Is, when the gold reserve reach es the point of danger Issue more bonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to prevent these re curring drains upo.i the gold reserve? If no further legislation Is had and the pol icy of selling bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than Is now authorized by law. I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite suffi cient to pay all the expenses of the gov ernment that, when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. To Maintain the Reserve. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the gov ernment he should not receive back from the government a United States note with out paying gold in exchange for it The reason for this is made all the more ap parent when the government issues an Interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes— a non-interest-bearlng debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out In any other way they may return again to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them—another interest-bearing debt to redeem a non-interest-bearlng debt In my view it. is of the utmost im portance that the government should be relieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges and ex port. This responsibility Is alone borne by the government without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help Hstlf. The banks do not feel the strain of gold redemption. Th* whole yr- m: M, BB&S 1 1 Hot AdrUed—Bimetallic Commlulon Hot Tot Discharged Hawaii and Other Coantrlea* government, we may feel no immediate embarrassment from our present cur rency but the danger still exists and will bo ever present, menacing us so long as the existing system continues. And, besides, It is In times of adequate rev enues and business tranquillity that the government should prepare for the worst Wo cannot avoid, without serious con sequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of this question. The secretary of the treasury has outlined a plan in great detail for the purpose of re moving the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve, and to save us from future embarrassment on that account. To this plan I Invite your careful con sideration. Indorses Secretary Gage. I concur with the secretary of the treas ury in his recommendation that national banks be allowed to Issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one half of one per cent per annum. I also Join him In recommending that authority be given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25, 000. This will enable the smaller vil lages and agricultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. I recommend that the issue of national bank notes "bo restricted to the denomina tion of $10 and upward. If the sugges tions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress, then I would rec ommend that national banks be required to redeem their notes In gold. The most important problem with which this gov ernment is now called upon to deal per taining to its foreign relations concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban in surrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this government at various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest,growing discontent: an effort to ward a larger enjoyment of liberty and self-control: of organized resistance to the mother country of depression after dis tress and of warfare and of Ineffectual settlement to be followed by renewed re volt. For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of the continental pos sessions of Spain In the western conti nent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern to the United States. The pros pect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth, between 1823 and 1860, va rious emphatic declarations of the pol icy of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's connection with Spain unless in the direction of Inde pendence or acquisition by us through purchase—nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon the part of the government. Situation in Cuba GraTC. The revolution which began in 1SGS lasted for ten years despite the strenu ous efforts of the successive peninsular governments to suppress it. Then, as now, the government of the United States testified its grave concern and offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed In Cuba. The overtures made by Gen. Grant were refused and the war dragged on, entailing great loss of life and treasure and in creased injury to American interests, be sides throwing enhanced burdens of neu trality on the government. In 1878 peace was brought about by the truce of Zan Jon, obtained by negotiations between the Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders. The present Insurrection broke out In February, 1895. It Is not my purpose at this time to recall Its remarljgLie in crease or to characterize its ^£fTacioVis re sistance, against the je^yjpnious farces by Spain. The re^tilL and the efforts to subdue it carried des truction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been dis regarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. The existing conditions cannot but fill this government and the American peo ple with the gravest apprehension. There is no desire on the part of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to sc. the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of self-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected in their right to reap the benefit of the ex haustless treasures of their country. The offer made by my predecessor in April, 1SS6, tendering the friendly offices of this government failed. Any mediation on our part was not accepted. In brief, the answer read: "There is no effectual way to pacify Cuba unless it begins with the actual submission of the rebels to the mother country." Then only could Spain act in the promised direction of her own motion and after her own plan. Calls Spain's Policy Cruel. The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The produc tive districts controlled by the Spanish armies were depopulated. The agricul tural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy of the late cabinet of Spain was justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It was extermination. Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained on repeated occas ions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this government. There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by alleged illegal ar rests and long imprisonment awaiting trial or pending protracted judicial pro ceedings. I felt it my first duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under arrest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet In Oc tober last, twenty-two prisoners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom. For the relief of our own citizens suf fering because of the conflict the aid of congress was sought in a special mes sage. and under the appropriation of April 4, 1897, effective aid has been given to American citizens in Cuba, many of them at their own request having been returned to the United States. The Instructions given to our new min ister to Spain before his departure for his post directed him to Impress upon that government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, and honor able alike to Spain and to the Cuban peo ple. TheBe Instructions rcclted the character and duration of the contest, the wide spread losses it entails, the burdens and restraints It imposes upon us, with con stant disturbance of national interests and the Injury resulting from an Indefin ite continuance of this state of things. Time Blpe for a Change. It was stated at this juncture our gov ernment was constrained to seriously in quire if the time was not ripe when Spfcin, of her own volition, moved by her own in terests and every sentiment of humanity, should not put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlement honorable to herself and just to her Cu ban colony. It was urged that as a neighboring nation, with large interests In Cuba, we could be required to wait only a reasonable time for the mother country to establish its authority and re store order within the borders of the island that we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea of humiliation to Spain could attach and indeed precise proposals were withheld to avoid embarrassment to that government. All that was asked or expected was that some safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace restored, it so chanced that the consld- 'a "t% 1 rests upon the ^jvernment and fir* size of the gold reserve in the treasury has oome to be, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought to bo stopped. If we are to have an era of prosperity in the country, with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the 1 1 1 eratlon of this offer, addressed to the same Spanish administration which had declined the tenders of my predecessor and which for more than two years had poured men and treasure into Cuba In the fruitless effort to suppress the re volt, fell to others. Between the departure of General Woodford, the now envoy, and his ar rival In Spain, the statesman who had shaped the policy of his country, fell by the hand of an assassin and, although the cabinet of the late premier still held of fice and received from our envoy the pro posals he bore, that cabinet gave place within a few days thereafter to a new administration, under tho leadership of Sagasta. The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in the direc tion of a better understanding. Recognized as Friendly Power. It appreciates the friendly purposes of this government. It admits that our coun try is deeply affected by the war in Cuba and that Its desires for peace are just. It declares that the presei.t Spanish gov ernment Is bound by every consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end Spain has decided to put into effect the political reforms hereto fore advocated by tho present premier, without halting for any consideration In the path which in Its judgment leads to peace. Tho military operations, it is said, will continue, but will bo humane and conducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political ac tion leading to the autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in invest ing Cuba with a distinct personality the island to be governed by an executive and by a local council of chamber, reserving to Spain the control of tho foreign rela tions, the army and navy and the judi cial administration. To accomplish this the present government proposes to modi fy existing legislation by decree, leaving the Spanish cortes, with the aid of Cu ban senators and deputies, to solve the economic problem and properly distribute the existing debt In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this government proposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices it suggests that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms, while the United States, for Its part, shall enforce Its neutral ob ligations and cut off the assistance which it Is asserted the insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an indefinite prolon gation of the war is denied. It is assert ed that the western provinces are well nigh reclaimed that the planting of cane and tobacco therein has been resumed and that by force of arms and new and am ple reforms very early and complete pacification Is hoped for. ltetter State of Affairs Predicted. Tho immediate amelioration of exist ing conditions under the new administra tion of Cuban affairs Is predicted ,and therewithal the disturbance and all oc casion for any change of attitude on the part of the United States. Discussion of the question of the International duties and responsibilities of the United States as Spain understands them is presented, with an apparent disposition to charge us with failuro in tills regard. Belligerency Not Favored. I regard the recognition of the belliger ency of the Cuban insurgents as now un wise and therefore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter be deemed wise as a measure of right and duty the executive will take it. Intervention upon humanitaiian grounds has been frequently suggested and has not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But should such a step be now taken when It is apparent that a hopeful change has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new government has taken office In the mother country. It Is pledged in advance to the declaration that all the effort In the world cannot suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet: that vague prom ises of reform after subjugation afford no solution of the insular problem that with a substitution of commanders must comc a change "oF'the past* system 'of war-* fare for one in harmony with a new pol icy which shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans to the "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing In misery" that reforms must be Institut ed in accordance with the needs and cir cumstances of the time and that these re forms, while designed to give full auton omy to the colony and to create a vir tual entity and self-controlled adminis tration, shall yet conserve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a just distribu tion of powers and burdens upon a basis of mutual Interest, untainted by meth ods of selfish expediency. The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The policy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sentiment of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a broad clem ency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to rellove the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies. It Is asserted, Is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation but to protect the resumption of peaceful agri cultural pursuits and productive indus tries. On the Hawaiian Matter. By a special message dated the six teenth day of June last, I laid before the senate a treaty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the incorporation of the Ha waiian islands as an integral part of the United States, and under its sovereignty. The senate, having removed the injunc tion of secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, the sub ject may be properly referred to in this message because the necessary action of congress is required to determine by leg islation many details of the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as I believe It should be. While consistently disavowing from a very early period any progressive policy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of declarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed tho vital interest of the Unit ed States In the independent life of the islands and their intimate commercial de pendence upon this country. At the same time, it has been repeatedly asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the passage of the islands under the domination or Influence of another power than the United States. Under these circumstances the logic of events required that annexation, hereto fore offered, but declined, should In the ripeness of time come about as the nat ural result of the strengthening ties that hind us to those islands, and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian state. That treaty was unanimously ratified without amendment by the senate and president of the republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September last, and only awaits the favorable action of the Am erican senate to effect the complete ab sorption of the islands into the domain of the United States. What the condi tions of such a union shall be the po litical relation thereof to the United States the character of the local ad ministration: the quality and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants the extension of the federal laws to the territory or the enactment of special laws to fit the peculiar condition thereof the regulation, If need be, of the labor sys tem therein, are all matters which the treaty has wisely relegated to the con gress. Recommends a Confirmation. If the treaty is confirmed, as every con sideration of dignity and honor requires, the wisdom of congress will see to It that avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share In the highest franchises of citizenship, and hav ing due regard to the geographical condi tions, the most just provisions for self rule in local matters with the largest political liberties as an integral part of our nation will be accorded to the Ha wallans. No less is due to a people who, after nearly five years of demonstrated capacity to fulfill the obligations of self governing statehood, come of their own free will to merge their destinies in our body politic. •'I As to Blmetalllo Agreement. Under the provisions of the act of con gress approved March 3, 1897, for the pro motion of an International agreement re specting bimetallism, I appointed on the 14th day of April, 1897, the Hon. Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado, the Hon. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois and tho Hon. Charles J. Paine of Massachusetts as spe clay envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent tn their efforts to secure the co-operation of European countries In the International settlement of the question, but up to this time have not been able to secure an agreement contemplated by their mission. The gratifying action of our great sis ter republic of France in joining this country In the attempt to bring about an agreementamong the principal commercial nations of Europe whereby a fixed and relative value between gold and silver shall be secured furnishes assurance that we are not alone among the larger na tions of the world In realizing the Inter national character of the problem and In the desire of reaching some wise and practical solution of it. The British government has published a resume of tho steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the special envoys of the United States, with whom our ambassador at London Mstively co-operated In the presentation of this subject to her majesty's government. Tlila will bo laid before congress. Our ppecial envoys have not made their final report, is further negotiations between tho rep resentatives of this government and the governments of other countries are '.lend ing and in contemplation. They believe that doubts which have been raised In certain quarters respecting the position of maintaining tho stability of the parity between the metals and kindred ques tions may yet be solved by further ne gotiations. Meanwhile it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have al ready demonstrated their ability and fit ness to deal with the subject, and It Is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an international agreement which will bring about the recognition of both gold and silver as money upon sueh terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no Injustice to any class of our citizens. Worlc on Revenue Provisions. In order to execute as early as possible the provisions of tho third and fourth sec tions of the revenue act approved July 24. 1S97, I appointed the Hon. John A. Kas son of Iowa a special commissioner plen ipotentiary to undertake the requisite ne gotiations with foreign countries desir ing to avail themselves of these provis ions. Tho negotiations are now proceed ing with several governments, both Eur opean and American. It Is believed that by a careful exercise of tho powers conferred by that act some grievances of our own and of other coun tries In our mutual trade relations may be either removed or largely alleviated, and that tho volume of our commercial exchanges may be enlarged, with advant age to both contracting parties. Most de sirable from every standpoint of national Interest and patriotism is the effort to ex tend our foreign commerce. To this end our merchant marine should be Improved and enlarged. Wo should do ojr full share of the carrying trade of the world. Wc do not do it now. We should be the laggcr no longer. The Inferiority of our merchant marine is justly humiliating to the national pride. The government by every proper constitutional means should aid in making our ships familiar visitors at every commercial port of the world, thus opening up new and valuable mar kets to the surplus products of the farm and the factory. Protection of the Far Seals. The efforts which had been made dur ing the two previous years by my prede cessor to secure better protection to the fur seals in the north Pacific ocean and Bering sea were renewed at an early date by this administration, and have been pursued with earnestness. Upon my invi tation tho governments of Japan and Russia sent delegates to Washington and an international conference was held dur Iflg-tM-fflefttfrs-dH&fr&Br and Nov&mter last, wherein it was unanimously agreed that under tho existing regulations this species of useful animals was threatened with extinction, and that an international agreement of all the interested powers was necessary for their adequate protec tion. The government of Great Britain did not see proper to bo represented at this conference, but subsequently sent to Washington, delegates, the expert Com missioners of Gr*at Britain and Canada, who had, during (lie past two years, vis ited the Pribilot islands and who met in conference similar commissioners on the part of the United States. The result of this conference was an agreement on important fads connected with the con dition of the seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which should place beyond con troversy tho duty of the governments concerned to adopt measures without de lay for the preservation and restoration of the herd. Negotiations to this end are now in progress the result of which I hope to be able to report to congress at an early day. International Arbitration- International arbitration cannot be omitted from the list of subjects claim ing our consideration. Events have only served to strengthen the general views on this question expressed In my inaugural address. The best sentiment of tho civ ilized world is moving toward the settle ment of differences between nations with out resorting to the horrors of war. Treat ies embodying these humane principles on broad lines without in any way im periling our interests or our honor shall have my constant encouragement. Itciource* of the Navy. Tho present immediately effective force of the navy consists of four battleships of the first class, two of the second and forty-eight other vessels, ranging from armored cruisers to torpedo boats. There are under construction five battleships of the first class, sixteen torpedo boats and one submarine boat. No provision has yet been made for the armor of three of the five battleships, as it has been impos sible to obtain it at the price fixed by con gress. It is of great Importance that congress provide this armor, as until then tho ships are of no fighting value. The present naval force, especially in view of its increase by tho ships now nndtr con struction, while not as large as that of a few other powers, is a formidable force: its vessels are the very best of each type: and with the Increase that should be made to it from time, to time in the fu ture, and careful attention to keeping it in a high state of efficiency and repair, it is well adapted to the necessities of the country. The great increase of the navy which has taken place In recent years was justified by the requirements for nat'ona' defense and has received public appro bation. Tho time has now arrived, how ever. when this increase, to which the country is committed, should, for a time, take the form of increased facilities com mensurate with tho increase of our na val vessels. It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on the Pacific coast capable of docking our largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic coast, and that the latter has for the last six or seven months been under repair, and therefore Incapable of use. Immediate steps should be taken to provide three or four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic coast, at least one on the Pacific coast and a float ing dock on the gulf. This is the recom mendation of a very competent board, ap pointed to Investigate the subject. There should also be ample provision made for powder and projectiles, and other muni tions of war, and for an increased num ber of officers and enlisted men. Some additions are also necessary to otir navy yards, for the repair and care of our larger number of vessels. As there are how on the stocks five battleships of the largest class, which cannot be completed for a year or tyro, I concur with the rec ommendation jf the secretary of the navy for an appropriation authorizing ths construction of one battleship for the Pacific coast, where at present there is only ouc In commission and one under construction, while on the Atlantic coast there are three in commission and four •pan* under construction: and also that eral torpedo boats bo authorized In con nection With our general system of coast defense. Alaska Require* Attention. The territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of congress. The conditions now existing demand ma terial changes In the laws relating the territory. Tho great influx of popu lation during tho past summer and fau and tho prospect of a still larger immi gration in the spring will not Military Force I» Nece«»ary. I concur with the secretary of war in his suggestions as to the necessity for a military forco in tho territory of Alaska for tho protection of persons and prop erty. Already a small force, consisting of twenty-five men, with two officers, un der command of Lieut.-Col. Randall of the Sth infantry, has been sent to St. Michael to establish a military post. As it is to the interest of the government to encourage the settlement of the coun try and its duty to follow up Its citizens with the benefit of its legal machinery, I earnestly urge upon congress the estab lishment of a system of government with such flexibility as will enable it to ad just itself to the future areas of great est population. The startling, though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon river country of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people who are wintering there with out the means of leaving the country are confirmed In such measure as to Justify brlnglngTlie matter to the attention of congress. Access to that country in win ter can be had only by the passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most diffi cult and perhaps an Impossible task. How ever. should these reports of the suffer ing of our fellow-citizens be further veri fied, every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief. Yellow Fever a Menace. The recent prevalence of yellow fever in a number of cities and towns through out tho South has resulted In much dis turbance of commerce and demonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws as will make the regula tions of the national quarantine authori ties paramount. The secretary of the treasury, in the portion of his report re lating to the operation of the marine hos pital service, calls attention to the de fects of the present quarantine laws and recommends amendments thereto which will give the treasury department the requisite authority to prevent the invas ion of epidemic diseases from foreign countries, and in times of emergency like that of the past summer will add to the efficiency of the sanitary measures for the protection of the people and at the same time prevent unnecessary restriction of commerce. concur in his recommen dation. In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United Stales by yellow fever the Importance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease, which up to the present time has been undeter mined, Is obvious, and to this end a sys tematic bacteriological investigation should be made. I therefore recommend that congress authorize the appointment of a commission by the president, to con sist of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selected from the medical officers of the marine hospital service, one to be ap pointed from_civil life, one to bo detailed from-the-MedicaT officers of the arhiy and one from the medical officers of the navy. Sale Of the Union Pacific. The Union Pacific railway main line was sold under the decree of the United States coul't fot the district of Nebraska on the 1st and 2d of November of this year. The amount due the government consisted of the principal of tho subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness $5S,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the govern ment, principal and interest. The pale of the subsidized portion of the Kansas Pa cific line, upon which the government holds a second mortgage lien, has been postponed at the instance of the povern ment to December 10, 1S97. The debt of this division of the Union Pacific railway to the aovernment on November 1, 1M)7, was the principal of the subsidy bonds, $i',303,000, and the unpaid and accrued in terest thereon, $8,626,690.33, making a total of $12,929,690.33. The sale of tills road was originally ad vertised for November 4, but for the pur pose of securing the utmost public notice of tho event It was postponed until De cember 16, and a second advertisement of the sale was made. By decree of the court the upset price on the sale of the Kansas Pacific will yield to the govern ment the sum of $2,500,000 over all prior liens, costs and charges. If no other or better bid is made this sum is all that the government will receive on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. The government has no information as to whether there will be other bidders or a better bid than the minimum amount herein stated. The question presented therefore is whether the government shall, under the author ity given it by the act of March 3, 18S7. purchase or redeem the road In the event that a bid Is not made by private parties covering the entire government claim. How It Must Qualify. To qualify the government to bid at the sale will require a deposit of $900,000. as follows: In the government cause $500, 000 and in each of the first mortgage causes $200,000, and In the latter the de posit must be in cash. Payment at the sale is as foilows: Upon the acceptance of the bid, a sum which the amount al ready deposited shall equal 15 per cent of the bid the balance in Installments thir ty, forty and fifty days after the con firmation of the sale. The lien on the Kansas Pacific prior to that of the gov ernment on July 30, 1897, principal and Interest, amounted to $7,281,048.11. Tlu government, therefore, should it bscome the highest bidder, will have to pay the amount of the first mortgage lien. I believe that under the act of 1S87 it has the authority to do this, and in ab sence of any action by congress, I shall direct the secretary of the treasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the court's decree to qualify as a bid der and to bid at the sale a sum which will at least equal the principal of the debt due to the government: but sug gest, in order to remove all controversy, that an amendment of the law bo im mediately passed explicitly giving such powers and appropriating in general terms whatever sum is sufficient there for. In so Important a matter as the govern ment becoming the possible owner of rail road property, which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel constrained to lay before congress these facts for its consideration and action before the con summation of the sale. It is clear to my mind that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price which will yield less than one-half of the principal of its debt and less than one fifth of its entire debt, principal and In terest. But whether the government, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder and thereby the owner of the property, I submit to con gress for action. Views on Civil Service. The Important branch of our govern ment. known as the civil service, the practical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest discussion, has of late years received Increased legisla tive and executive approval. During the .- W' V-.."wi :-Qy_ permit us to longer neglect the extension of civil authority within the territory or post pone the establishment of a more thor ough government A general system of public surveys has not been extended to Alaska and all en tries thus far made in that district arc upon special surveys. The act of con gress extending to Alaska the mining laws of tho United States contained the reservation that it should not be con strued to put In force the general land laws of the country. By an act approved March 3, 1891, authority was given for entry of lands for town site purposes and also for the purchase of not exceed ing 160 acres then or thereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The purpose of congress as thus far ex pressed has been that only such rights should apply to that territory as should be specifically named. :1"/" .-•Y'l..: past few months the service has been placed upon a .still firmer basis of business methods nnd personal merit. Whilei the right of our veteran soldiers to reinstate ment In deserving cases has been assert ed, dismissals for merely political re*s°"s have been carefully guarded against, tno examinations for admittance to the ser vice enlarged and at the same time ren dered less technical and more practical and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon all cases where incompetency Is chwrged or demand mado for the removal of of ficials in any of the departments. I am forced by the length of this mes sage to omit many important references to affairs of the government with which congress will have to deal at tho present session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all of which I invite your earnest attention. The esti mates of the expenses of tho government by the several departments will, lam sure, have your careful scrutiny. While the congress may not find it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the government, it should not encourage their increase. These expenses will, in my judgment, admit of a decrease in many branches of the government without injury to the public service. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the re ceipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit. 

WILLIAM M'KINLEY. IN BEHALF OF CUBA'S CAUSE, Ten Propositions Submitted to the Presi dent iy the Cuban League of America. Washington, Dec. 6.—President McKln ley to-day gave a hearing to Berkeley Balch, secretary of the Cuban League of America. Col. Ethan Allen, president of the League, was unable to come to Wash ington with the secretary, who submitted to Mr. McKinley the following written argument in behalf of the Cuban cause: "Mr. President: We appear before you in tho name of those who have died for the cause of freedom in tho island of Cuba, and for thoso who are still ready to give their lives to-day or to-morrow for tills cause: also representing, as we claim, a majority of the people of the United States, who believe in that cause and demand that their wishes shall now be translated into efficient action by their chosen representatives. Thanks to the power, honor, and patriotism of the Am erican press the people to-day know the essential facts of the Cuban situation. We submit to you, therefore, these ten propositions for your consideration: "First—The three wars in Cuba within tills century are proof of a genuine move ment for the extension of democratla principles and the attainment of liberty from a tyrannical, corrupt, and alien gov ernment. "Second—Without the indirect aid giv en by this government to Spain, the pa triots would bo further advanced In their struggle. "Third—Spain has lost Cuba as far as the present population is concerned. If, however, she is permitted to continue the cruel work of exterminating non-combat ants she may possibly reconquer and re populate the Island, "Fourth—If, with our passive aid, she unfortunately succeeds In doing this,when another generation comes the revolution will surely begin again. The governing classes in Spain of all parties havo re garded Cuba for 300 years as an orange to be squeezed. They are unable to con sider it otherwise, and no amount of dip lomatic effort on our part is likely to change their point of view. The other classes are ignorant. Spain has held all her colonies with an iron hand until forc ed to let go. The war of liberation In Venezuela lasted fifteen years, and during tho last five years of the struggle no quarter was given by either side. "Fifth—Autonomy is a foolish dream. It is evident that neither side understands it, wishes it, nor can administer it. Spain clearly offers it, to amuse this govern ment and to gain time. "Sixth—A majority of the people of this country desire to see a free and independ ent Cuban republic. An opposing factor of great force is the money power. It la a fair conclusion to urge that a majority of our people believe that the assistance of our government till now has been giv en to Spain and withheld from the re public on account of the influence that emanates from great financial interests, usually afraid of patriotic aggressive ipovements. "Seventh—Our people have hoped for favorable action lor Cuba from tho pres ent administration, and have patiently waited to give the administration time for the consideration of tho wise road to this end. That patience is now ex hausted. "Eighth—Very few Cubans and still few er people in this country desire immediate annexation, but independence is clearly due to Cuban valor and sacl iflces. "Ninth—It is of supreme importance to our future defence that Cuba be in the possession of a friendly power. This Spain has never been and probably can never be. "Tenth—The friendship of the republic of Cuba is worth vastly more to us than that of Spain, for reasons of business and defence. It is our duty and self-inter est to recognize the belligerency, and, log ically following this, the Independence of the republic, and to conclude with It a defensive and offensive alliance. If this is not compatible with a continued friendship with Spain, so much the worse for Spain. If Spain attacks us we can take care of our own. "Out of the experience of our work, and from the study of over twenty years, this league asserts that these ten proposi tions arc true, and that their right un derstanding leads to the only action which will solve the problem. "And now, Mr. President, in behalf of thoso we represent, we thank you for this opportunity to present their views. We hope for such action on your part as will bring a correct solution. We desire to state that this league and our sympa thizers have 'enlisted for the war,' or un til such time as the republic of Cuba shall become a fact in history." Intelligence of Swallows. Grant Allen tells some curious and wonderful things about swallows. In making the mud watls of their nests, they allow each layer to dry thorough ly before proceeding to top it with an other. In building their nests in chim neys they place them five or six feet below the top to keep out of the way of owls, and not directly over the lire, but over an adjoining flue. The emergence of the young birds from this place i3 a remarkable inT stance of instinct which seems to al most reach intelligence. As soon as they are strong enough to move, the little things clamber up the shaft by beating their wings "in some ineffect ual compromise between a flop and a flutter. Having succeeded in reaching the top, it is some time before they venture to fly they acquire the art by degrees." Many instances have been given of their remarkable intelligence. In one case a bell-wire on which a swallow's nest partly rested twice de molished it. Convinced that it was a dangerous object, they constructed a tunnel for the wire to pass through, and were troubled no more. In an other, a pair of swallows were mo lested by sparrows trying to force them from their nest. They imme diately went to work and changed the entrance of their little home so that, instead of opening by a simple hole, It had to be entered by passing through a tunnel of straws and hairs.
