With our last issue wo placed before our road ors tho annual message of Oov. Simpson. It is an able und conciso state paper, recommend ing in plain and practical lunns mich changes and modifications of tho law us aro likely tn dovclop tho material and educational interests of tho Stato and to promoto tho publie wel fare. Wo invite special attention to. that portion of tho message which relates to pub lic ronds. Tho public roads ufa Connty truly furnish tho index to its civilization ns well ns to its material and commercial prosperity. Thoy enable tho farmer tn convoy to market bin produce at less cost and labor and with loss wear and tear of his stock and wagons, und to return to his furm such groceries and necessaries as he must get from abroad. A well graded and well worked network of public roads is closoly oonnectod with tho development nf every industry, and if, ns tho .Governor says, our roads fifty years ago had boon properly laid off und improved annually what a great benefit they would havo beou to our peoplo. This should bo looked to every year and snob cbnngcs ho mudo gradually ns will improve thc grado and rcduco tho work I required on our roads. In tho palmiest days of the Roman lOmpire Italy was noted for ber smooth and easy road*, and in a broken country liko ours too great attention cannot be paid to this molter. Thc affect of engineering skill in the laying out of roads can bc easily seen by persons who travel over tho Tucka* scgeo or Rowland Turnpike, built by Mr. Slouu bolero tho war. Though it climbs mountains, tho grado is so easy nod tho bed 6o smooth that tho traveler can hardly realize ho is in tho midst, of tho mountains, unless bc notices the deep gorgos on ono sido and the ruggod slcopness on tho other. By propor attention in the COUrso of twonty or Ithirty years travel hero could bo groatly im proved by propor changes in our public ronds. Nothing would improve more tho value of our l?inds or tend more to draw population. Tho Governor also strongly urges the passage nf sumo law to stop tho pernicious prnciico of carrying concealed weapons, und also a law tb encourage tile restocking ol our rivets with fish, and also a law te "lay tho foundation* of tho State Wr University broad and deop, so that as time rolls on story aftor story may bp built thereon, ns rho educational wants cf thc ' peoplo may demand, until it could stand forth amid the educational stmeiuros of thc world, grnrid and majestic in all its propor tions" lt may bo said tho peoplo nt this I timo aro too limited in means to justify the reopening this institution by State, nid. i This is true, but wc are glad to soo our Go vornor looks to tho time when its classic halls will someday bo again filled with the youth of our Stato and of otbor Staten. To ifs training tho Stato nwoa much of hor pun? grcntnoss, which in past years shined forth in her ministry, in hor bar and Ju diciary and' in statesmanship. With ono of tho best selected libraries in the United Slates and with grounds and build? inga well improved and adapted to tho pur? pososof a college, wo would not liko to seo itfl doors closed fore vor At this time noarly all the State? havo either a university or colloga under their control, und it would certainly J bo a stop backward for South Carolina to close M an institution which hus boon in existence moro than th reo sooro and ton years. Tho Governor also rooomm.ends that suoh laws bb passed a? will pr?vido bettor moans for (ho comfortable Support of tho poor in ouch county. It is no

To tho publio in general wo oxtond a cordial invitation to attend. It is to be hoped that tho ladies will load US their cheering proRcnce. Wo can do nothing without tho corporation of tho peoplo, and they should aid us. Addresses will bo delivorcd by Dr. J. P. Smoltzor, Mr. John S. Vernor and Col. W. C. Keith, and on ossay will bo road by Prof. S. P. Boozer, which will moko the mooting quito interesU ing, and ovory teacher should bo presont to hear them, in ordor to reap all tho benefit possible. HUGH STRONG, W. P. CALHOUN, Prosidont. Seorotary. LONDON, Dcoomber 1.-Tho Times, in a leader discussing President Hayes' message, says: "If legal teodor notes are oallod in and cancelled, silver dollars must take their plaoo and tho present plethora bo thus re lieved." Eurthor relief, it thinks, will oome from tho natural operation of tho laws of trade. Money which has flowed so freely from Europe to the United States rill make itself felt in tho latter country by on advanoo iu prices. This advance will bo followed by a demand for European goods. Tho process may bo slow but it is OB sure os tho movemont of tides." It is a faot well worth noting that thc exports of domestic merchandise from tho United States wcro larger, iu value, during the lust fiscal year than during any previous ono in tho history of this country. It is o second fuot worth noting that tho exports of all sorts wore in voluo 8711,637,393, and tho total imports 8145,777,755-so that tho former wero to tho latter os OJ to4, and surpassed them by $205,850,638. Tho exports were reokond in a mixed gold und curroncy valut ; tho imports only in gold. Allowing for this, wo still have a balaneo of about 8250,000,000 on tho export side.
