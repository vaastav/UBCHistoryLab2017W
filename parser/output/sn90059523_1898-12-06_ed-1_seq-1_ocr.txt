(Th<;- ful! toxt of tho president's message to congress will be found up_n pages 5 and 6 of this issue). 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Many sen ators excused themselves from expres sion of opinions at length upon the message, on the ground that they had net been able to give careful attention to all the details. Some senators were, however, willing to express themselves in a few general words of commenda tion. tor Cullom regarded* it as a "painstaking, entertaining and accur rate historical review." tor Platt, of New York, com mended the expression of a determina tion, to increase the standing array and to maintain order in Cuba until the Cubans can take care of themselves. Senator "Wolcott said it was an ad mil ab.o document. Senator Lodge said it was "able and excellent." Senator Foraker —"A good presentation of facts generally, but a little indefinite on the question of Cuban Independence." Sen ate r Proctor said: "A good American paper." Senator Perkins—"lt was an able resume of the situation and of the facts leading up to the war." The Democrats were even more averse than the Republicans to discuss the paper. Senator Jones, of Arkansas, ■was an exception. He found fault with a number of points which did not ac cord with his views. One of these was to continue the volunteers in exile un til the standing army can be increased. "Some of us do not favor the Increase of the standing army," he said, "and the president has no right to assume that a majority stand with him on that proposition." The Arkansas senr-tor also question ed the president's right to hold the volunteers in service beyond the time of signing the peace treaty, saying on this point: "There Is no war in exist ence, and none is imminent. The law requires one or the other condition, and the threat of the president to hold the volunteers in the service until the standing army is increased beyond what the conscience of members and senators dictates, looks to me like a menace and dictation which I regard as an outrage and unfavorably." 

CURRENCY AND CUBA. Senator Jones objected to the pres ident's expression upon the finances and greenbacks, and said that he did not believe a majority of the American people would indorse him in this re spect. The senator also announced himself as opposed to a subsidy to ves sels connecting the United States with Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines, as opposed to legislation for the con struction of the Nicaragua canal as at present contemplated, and expressed the opinion that the president was in clined to go further in the matter of the government of Cuba than the reso lutions of intervention had called for. !

To go to the ex tent of insuring, as the president rec ommends, complete tranquility, might prove a prelude for a military govern ment, and an occupation never to be ended. I do not indorse such an un derstanding." Senator Jones also expressed surprise at the absence of any recommendation concerning the Philippines. "The ques tion of the government of the Philip pines is attracting much attention," he said, "and the fact that the president utterly ignores it strikes me as very singular." Senator Pasco also commented upon the absence of any reference to points concerning "which we most desire most information." He said, it was a good historical paper and would be conven ient for future reference. 

SUGGESTIONS LACKING. Senator Teller said there would be disappointment over the failure of the president to outline a government for the Philippines, saying: "There will be some disappointment in this, for I think the understanding had been that the president would indicate what form of government should be provided for these new possessions. But It Is wise for the president not to indicate his views on the subject, for . that is purely and properly a legislative ques tion, and one that should be left to congress." On the recommendations in regard to currency, Senator Teller said: "The subject of bimetallism, either national or international, will find no encour agement from anything the president says in his message. No reference is made to international bimetallism, but the president, in the most emphatic way, Indicates his Intention to main tain the gold standard. The so-called Silver Republican, who remains 'n the Republican party, and contends that the Republican party is friendly to sil ver, will find no encouragement In the president's message, and it will strike all as somewhat singular that, if the Republican party, as is claimed, Is in favor of international bimetallism, the president makes no reference to it." 

COMPILEMENT AND CRITICISM. Following are some of the opinions expressed by members of congress on the president's message: Representative Hitt, chairman of the house committee on foreign affairs— The president has summarized and salved, in an able and fellcitious man ner, many of the questions In men's minds everywhere, touching the im mense and rapidly succeeding events, and the situation in which the nation finds Itself. His simple proposition to let the new possessions alone until the military arm had conquered them gives us time for preparations for their permanent government. The problem of governing the Cubans he deals with gently and hopefully, and everybody will wieh that his forecast of stable government there will be realized sooner than ever yet has happened to a Spanish-American population." Representative Walker, chairman of the committee on banking and cur rency—l am asked what I think of the currency features of the president's message. I do not see that it has any such features. I have been unable to detect any. It contains only one rec ommendation to the currency, repeat- Ing that of a former message, to change the United States legal tender notes into gold currency, and which will have no effect on the banking and currency situation, but add to the burden of taxation without in any degree favora bly affecting the general banking and currency situation. Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio —The message is not along beaten paths. It is not encumbered with platitudes, and is written in a very active style. The references to history in the elaborate recitations of the event of the war are in good taste and devoid of boasting or vanity. The comment upon the in- ' cldents of the war and the valor of our men, naval and military, and the fine work of all our seamen and artificers, will be found fully justified by the facts- The views of the president upon the question of currency reform will meet the Intelligent sanction of sound money men of all parties. The wide scope of the message, touching bo many great questions, forbids a de tailed review in this brief interview. The message, on the whole, is able and eminently satisfactory, and I believe will be generally indorsed at home and abroad. 

CONCLUSIONS ARE LACKING. Gen. Wheeler (Dem.) of Alabama —It is a clear and comprehensive resume of every event that transpired during an eventful period of our country's his tory. It will be referred to as one of the noted state papers. Representative McMillin, Democrat, Term.—On the most important question confronting the nation—what shall we do with our newly acquired posses sions?—the president's message re minds me of the caption of the last chapter of Johnson's Ras Zelas. "The conclusion in which nothing is con cluded." Representative Bland, of Missouri— The message, so far as the currency question is concerned, is very brief, and contains nothing new and nothing beyond former documents. I might re mark that on the great leading issue —which is and will be the great par amount question, the free coinage of silver- —the president's message Is omi nously silent, for the solution of the money question cannot be considered without at the same time considering this question. Chairman Dlngley, of the ways and means committee —The message is an excellent resume of the important events of the last year, with clear propositions and suggestions, which will aid materially at the proper time hereafter in solving the different prob lems before us. It is to be noted that the president states that our revenue laws are working well, with no sug gestion of any needed modification. The message, though lengthy, is really a recital of the history-making events of the last year that will be read with unusual interest. ilr. Richardson (Dem., Term.)— The president makes a most interesting and satisfactory review of the Spanish war, but is disappointing in that he fails to tell us what to do with the new pos sessions. It is just as appropriate now as it will be after the treaty of peace for him to tell us what is to be the fu ture of the new territory. It might help to get the treaty ratified, if he had solved that problem. It is inter esting to note that three-fourths of the message relates to foreign affairs, and less than one-fourth to home mat ters. Banking and currency and aU financial reform legislation, so pro fusely promised in 1896, gets no men tion, and our conduct in regard to these matters 1b to be left unchanged. 

TUESDAY MORNING DECEMBER 6, 1898. RECEIVED IN SILENCE READING OF PRESIDENT'S MES SAGE IN THE SENATE CAUSED NO DEMONSTRATION SENATORS WEARIED OF IT Retired to the Cloak Room to Peruse Printed Copies Wlih Which They Had Been Supplied —Distinguished Visitors Grant ed the Privileges of the Floor ——Flowers and Greetings. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—When the senate convened today to begin the closing session of the Fifty-fifth con gress the chamber presented a notable and beautiful appearance. By 11 o'clock the public and private galleries were filled almost to their capacity with a distinguished assemblage, including many ladies in brilliant attire. On the floor of the senate the dis play of flowers was unusually beautiful | even for the opening day of a session !of congress. The odor of the flowers filled the chamber. The memorable scenes enacted in the chamber during the last session and the momentous events that have oc curred since congress last adjourned created a feeling of intense expectancy, both by the spectators and members ;of the senate. This was made mani : fest by the long: lines of people in the corridors, anxious to gain admission to the galleries, and by the early arrival of senators on the floor. Through courtesy of the vice presi dent the members of the joint high commission were admitted to the floor of the senate, and were the recipients of much attention. Just before the senate was called to order several well known members of the diplomatic corps appeared in the diplomatic gallery. Among them were Sir Julian Pauncefote, ambassador of Great Britain to the United States and dean of the corps, with a party from the British embassy; Mr. Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese minister, and party, and Mr. Me Pum Chim, tho Korean minister. All were interested specta tors of the opening scenes of the ses sion and attentive listeners to the read ing of the president's message. During a recess of three-quarters of an hour while the senate was await ing the presentation of the message from the president the members of the Joint high commission held an informal levee, greeting personally nearly all the members of the American senate. The reading of the president's mes sage, which occupied two hours and eighteen minutes, was received with very careful attention for an hour, but after that the senators drifted to the cloak rooms and to the committee rooms, where they could peruse the message at their leisure, in the print ed ocples with which they had been furnished. Many persons remained in the gal leries throughout the reading, but, as is usual, little attention was given to the presentation of the message, either in the galleries or on the floor, after tha first few pages. Not the slightest dem onstration occurred during the reading of the message. When the clerk had concluded tha reading, Mr. Mason (111.) presented a telegram from Mr. Pritchard (N. C.) announcing that illness prevented his attendance at the opening session. At 3:45, on motion of Mr. Platt (Conn.), the senate adjourned. 

FLOWERS AND COMPLIMENTS. Representatives Exchange Greet ings, but Transact Little Business. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The open ing session of the congress today was a spectacular occasion, animated and brilliant. There were more than the usuai number of distinguished person ages in the thronged galleries, includ- Three Senators Vote No» WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. —Three senators . ia signed statements have declared their opposition to the peace treaty. The men and their views are as follows: CHARLES J. FAULKNER—I am not in favor of the acquisition of the Philippine islands. I think that Spain »hould be induced to relinquish her sovereignty in the Phil ippines, but I do not favor making them a part of the United States. A. O. BACON —I am opposed to acquisition of the Phil ippine islands, but prefer seeing- the full treaty before saying definitely what my position will be relative to ratification. DONELSON CAFFERY—I am ag-ainst the ratification of that treaty first, last, and all the time. I would rather gee the United Stales pay $1,000,000,000 and not have the Philippines than to have them at all. Every one of those islands would be a point of attack for an enemy, and the population wonid be a continual source of trouble. The mission of thia country was finished in that part of the world when Montojo'a fleet was de stroyed, and we should have nothing more to do with the Phil ippine islands. ing many representatives of foreign governments, high officials and ladies and gentlemen conspicuous in social and political life. The greeting of the members were most cordial, and there was no outcropping of partisan rancor to mar the occasion. One of the most striking incidents was the cordial meet ing between the floor leaders of the respective sides, Messrs. Dingley -and Bailey. In view of the gossip about the possibility of Mr. Bailey being de posed as the minority leader, it Is sig nificant that the speaker named Mr. Bailey as the minority member of the committee to wait upon the president, an honor always bestowed the recog nized leader of the minority. Speaker Reed received a warm wel come from both sides of the house when he ascended the rostrum to call the house to order, but perhaps the greatest personal ovation to any mem ber was that given Maj. Gen. Wheeler, of Alabama, who has not been seen by many of his old colleagues since he went to the front at the head of the Continued on Fifth Page, CUT OFF BY 

STORM DETROIT IS ISOLATED FOR A FERIOD OF FULLY TWENTY FOIJR HOLR.S TELEGRAPH WIRES ALL DOWN Street Car Linen Compelled to Abandon Business, and Great Damage Done In "Various Mich igan Counties Xo Human Lives Lost, Though Many Animals Were Killed by Lli c Wires. DETROIT, Mich., Dec. s.—Detroit has never suffered suclh complete isolation from the outer world as during- the past twenty-four hours, caused by the worst storm experienced in these parts, bo far as its effect upon electric- wires is concerned, in thirteen years. Sunday noon the whKte particles be gan to come down, and for two hours It snowed Incessantly, a wet, soggy snow, which weighed d>wn trees and telegraph, wires and poles until they snapped and fell in all directions. Some telegraph service was maintained, up to about & o'clock Sund.i \r. night, when the laeit wire went down, and except one to Toledo, Detroit haxi no communi cation with tha outsid* world. Bay City was reached about the middle of this morning. Even tha,t service was wry uncertain, wires breaking con stantly. Street car service was par tially suspended today. Detroit almost had a monopoly of Michigan's portion of the blizzard, with the exception of a few counties in the southeastern part of the lower peninsu la, t!he rest of the staite escaping its worst features. Estimates of the damage are hard to get as so little progress has been made in repairing dlaimages. The Bell Tele phone company estimates its loss at $50,000, the Michigan Telephone com pany at $10,000; the Western Union Telegraph company at $7,000, and the Postal Telegraph company at $2,000. Ten thousand dollars is thought to cover the loss of the street railway company, and the w Teather bureau re ports that the total snow fall was only seven Inches. It was. .so soggy and wet, however, that it did much more damage than twice thai amount of dry snow. There was no los 3of human life, though a number of animals were shocked to death by live wires which had broken and wer6 dangling over the streets. Reports from the state show that the counties of St. Clair, Macomb, Oak land and Wayne suffered the principal losses. The Detroit afternoon papers were served with the president's mes sage by the Associated Press, despite the loss of the wires, by the dispatch ing of a special messenger with his precious document, which arrived in time for publication. The railroads did not suffer material ly from the snow, except that the lack of wire communication made it Im possible to run trains on time. To night the weather is clear, and tele graphic communication is being grad ually restored. Schooner Baker a, "Wreck.

The wind velocity in its path was seventy miles an hour. The weather station on its edge records six ty miles. The resultant damage was to trees and to outhouses only, no dam age to vessels having been reported- Telegraph communication was inter rupted for several hours. TWO STORM_ VICTIMS. One Died From Exhaustion, An other From Injuries Sustained. NEW YORK, Dec. s.—Two deaths re sulted from last night's storm in near by New Jersey. Mrs. Samuel Eldredge, sixty years of age, of Newark, was, with her husband, overtaken by the fiercest of the storm as she was go ing to the railway station in Elizabeth to return to New York. Exhaustion came upon her, and she died before help could be obtained. While Bridget Costello, a domestic, wa3 returning from a visit to her sis ter-in-law in Jersey City, a high fence was blown down on her, and her skull was fractured. Death ensued shortly! afterwards.

The breaker will likely be rebuilt. ——^——— LEECH LAKE REDS ARE STILL UNRULY FOLLOWERS OF "OLD BIG" SAID TO BE SHARPENING THEIR TOMAHAWKS , Surveyor on the Scene Writes That the Indians Are Not Satis fled, and Will Revolt Again at the First Opportunity. MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 5.—A letter has been received by Lieut. Frederick Vincent, of the Minneapolis army hos pital recruiting station from a young surveyor who has bsen living among the Leech Lake Indiana, and in his spare time has given his attention to a careful study of "Old Bug's" follow ers. He writes that the Indians are a peculiarly treacherous lot of out laws, that they never really intended to keep faith with Uncle Sam; that the recent truce is a farce, so far aa they are concerned, and that they are now preparing for a second uprising with great deliberation and minute at tention to detail. Lieut. Vincent's correspondent says that many of the Indians have brag ged to him recently that carefully pre pared plans, which are now being per fected, will result in the complete an nihilation of the American soldiers at Leech lake, and will render the posi tion of the native Insurgents absolutely invulnerable to successful attack from reinforcements. The writer adds that the Indians go strutting around the reserve in a sort of dress rehearsal war paint, poking fun at the handful of blue coats there and predicting that their dominion will last but a very short time. The essence of this latest news from the reservation seems to be that the Indians are not at all satisfied with their present condition any more than they were before the recent rebellion broke out, and that a good many of them are quite willing to defy the gov ernment at the point of the bayonet again at the first opportunity.

Ta SENATOR ON TRIAL CHARGE GROWS OUT OF LOOTING OP FIRST NATIONAL. BANK OF DOVER KENNY IN PRISONERS' DOCK On the First Hearing the Jury Dl» --ugrreed — Conspiracy Has Now Been Added to the Chnrg-es Pre ferred Against the Senator Banker Richardson Telia of the Defalcation. "WILMINGTON, Del., Dec. s.—United States Senator Richard Kenny, of Del aware, was today placed on trial In the circuit court for the second time on charges growing out of the looting: of the First National bank, of Dover, by Its teller, William N. Bogga. Senator Kenny was last arraigned on the charge of aiding and abetting Boggs in misapplying Ihe bank's funds, in last July, and, after a trial lasting over one week, the jury disagreed. Since then the charge of conspiracy has been Joined to the firat charge. The discovery of a shortage In the bank came In May, 1897, when Teller Boggs suddenly left Dover. The bank was found to have been looted in the sum of $107,000, or a little over Its capi tal stock. President Richardson, of the bank, came to the rescue and saved the Institution from failure. Boggs subsequently gave himself up and ad mitted his defalcations, at the same time .making statements which led to the arrest of Senator Kenny and sev eral other citizens of Dover. Two of the latter have been convicted and are now serving terms in the Trenton pen itentiary. Boggs pleaded guilty and Is awaiting sentence. The evidence against Senator Kenny deals largely with numerous stock transactions, in which he and Boggs were Interested. During his last trial, Senator Kenny was represented by Senator Gray, his colleague In the senate, and Lev! S. Bird. Senator Gray Is now In Paris with the peace commission, and ex-At torney John Biggs is assisting Mr. Bird. District Attorney Vandcrgriff represents the government In the pros ecution. Court did not open until nearly noon, and the accused senator was on hand early. After the usual preliminaries the jury was quickly seated. It Is said to be composed of seven Democrats and five Republicans. The court took a recess until 2:30 p. m., when the examination of witnesses began before a court room that was crowded to the doors. 

CASE OF THE STATE. In his opening address to the jury District Attorney Vandegriff said he would be able to prove that Senator Kenny drew money from the bank to which he was not entitled and used It to tide over difficulties brought upon him by stock speculation. He said that, by an arrangement with Boggs, Senator Kenny drew money from the bank when he had no funds there, Boggs making the defendant's ac count balance by the use of other money In the bank, or In some In stances by withholding the senator's checks until he had made good the de ficit. H. A. Richardson, president of the bank, testified to Boggs' connection with the institution, and said It came to the attention of the directors in October, 1895, that Boggs had been gambling. He confessed his fault and was forgiven. Witness had no further reason to sus pect Boggs until after his flight in May, 1896. Mr. Richardson said the defalcation was $107,000, and that the bank was able to continue by himself and others guaranteeing the stockhold ers from any loss, and reducing the capital stock from $100,000 to $50,000. A cause of delay and argument at the former trial was avoided today by the admission of numerous checks drawn by Senator Kenny to the order of a number of persons and paid by the First National bank. These cov ered the period from May to September, 1896, and aggregated nearly $9,000. Of this amount $5,868 represented stock dealings with E. B. Cuthbert & Co., of Philadelphia. It was admitted that Senator Kenny signed checks for $4,20'} of the amount represented in the stock translations for Boggs' benefit. The remainder represented his own deal ings. It was not developed what the stock was mainly dealt in, although counsel for the defendant tried to get Mr. Richardson to say the defaulter had dealt In Bay State Gas. Court then adjourned until tomor row. » mm. 

CIVIL WAR IS NEXT SPAIN'S TROUBLES WILL, NOT END WITH SIGNING OP PEACE TREATY CARLISTS ARE READY TO STRIKE A BLOW NO ONE BELIEVES THAT THE PRB. TENDER CAN REACH THE SPANISH THRONE SPANISH REPUBLICANS AN IGNORED QUANTITY Not Dangerous Because Hopelessly Divided French Public In tensely Interested in the Futnre of Spain Sensational Sitting of the Paris Peace Commission—- Senator Fryc Leaves in Disgust. PARTS, Dec. s.—The belief is general here that there will be a Carlist up rising in Spain the moment the peace treaty is signed. No one for an instant believes, however, that the insurreo tion will place the Bourbon pretender on the throne. The French public is intensely interested in the future of Spain. The press urges the pretender not to plunge the country into civil war. The Spanish Republicans at thta Juncture are an ignored quantity. It is freely admitted that from them there Is no danger, inasmuch as they are hopelessly divided. French friends of the United States continue to discuss the results that any likely to grow out of the American tendency toward expansion. Prof. Pierre Emile Levasseur, a prominent political economist and a member of the Institute of France, fears that one. of the results of expansion may be to make America more protectionist than ever. "The cost of the war and the cost of subduing new colonies," he said, "de mand much money, and the ports at' entry will be the best place to raise the necessary funds." Robert de Calx, in the Journal dcs Debats, devotes a long editorial to the report of Secretary Alger. While, In his opinion, the Americans enter upon their new departure with many things in their favor—their recognized, business ability and their open-mind-> edness, for instance—he still believes they have many bitter disappointments before them. "Hence it is with friend ly curiosity," he says, "that we s'-o them take up a difficult task which we ourselves have undertaken, and In which, up to the present, we have Bo poorly succeeded." SPAIN A VOLCANO. Seething With Sedition Born ol Bankruptcy and Ruin. LONTX)N, Dec. 6.—The Paris corre spondent of the Daily Telegraph says: "According to trustworthy news from Madrid, Spain is seething with sedi tion born of bankruptcy and ruin. Ona of the best Informed men in the king dom assures me that the chances of revolution are increasing by leaps and bounds. "Carlism exists in three provinces only, but the disaffection toward the present government Is co-extensive with the entire Spanish race." fruitlTsVTarley. Peace Commissioners Consume Four Hours Without Result. 

PARIS, Dec. s.—The Joint commis sions conferred for over four hours to day. Much of the discussion concerned details as to the guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish citizens in the ceded colonies. The debate was energetic, and the Spaniards on emerging ap peared to be dejected. Secretary OJeda, of the Spanish com mission, when questioned after the meeting as to the progress made, an swered excitedly: "I am almost mad. I cannot talk. We are making progress." The American commissioners declin ed to say anything further than that the progress made was satisfactory. The Spanish commissioners have re ceived authority to bind their govern ment on certain matters, but there are yet important questions upon vvhica their* instructions are unsatisfactory, and it Is likely that many of the de tails involved in the change of sov ereignty in the Spanish colonies will be left for settlement when the regu lar diplomatic relations between the, two countries are resumed. The history of the document which will certify the passing of the oldest colonial power In the world and the advent of the newest was epitomized by Judge Day this evening in a single sentence: "A peace treaty can contain any thing which the victors put into it." The Americans have listened for hours with Their customary patience to the technicalities Invoked by the Spaniards, with their customary shrewdness and persistency, against every proposal making for the dismem berment of their empire. Darkness had come on, and the liv eried attendants furnished by the French authorities had placed a tiny lamp at the elbow of each commission er. Senator Frye, whose unconcealed contempt for diplomatic quibblings ex cited the astonishment of the punctil ious Castilians, had stalked home, his patience exhausted. The burden of the Spanish arguments was that matters outside the bare cession, and evacua tion of the conquered territories, which the Americans proposed to cover by the treaty, were beyond the legitimate and customary scope of a peace treaty. Be hind this bulwark Senor Montero Rios, president of the Spanish commission, fortified himself, bombarding his op ponents with a supply of arguments and precedents which inspired the free ly expressed admiration of the Amer icans. Finally, Judge Day summariz ed the American position in the fore- Continued on Third Page.
