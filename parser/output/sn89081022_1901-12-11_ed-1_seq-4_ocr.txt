President Roosevelt's message is an interesting document, though its length will probably keep the ma-ists jority of the people from reading it. The first subject, and the one treated most thoroughly and emphatically, is that of anarchy. It is denounced in the strongest terms, and stringent leg islation against anarchists is de manded. Roosevelt wants attacks on the president and those in line for succeeding him (the vice president and cabinet members) made an of fense coming under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Strict regulations for keeping anarchists out of the country are asked for. On the trust question the president is very emphatic in endorsing the giant corporations as a business necessity and a good thing for the country. But he wants publicity, so as to protect the investor from paying out their money for watered stock. Be also suggests the possible need of some sort of regulation of the trusts at some future time, but nothing must be done that will hamper them in their battle for supremacy in international trade. This part of the message is very satisfactory to the trusts. Jim Hill's paper, the St. Paul Globe, gives this part an unqualified endorsement. Roosevelt gives positive notice that the tariff question must not be mon keyed with, because that would cause apprehension and uncertainty in the business world. Reciprocity may be302 allowed, provided it does not hurt any American industry. A sit would .be very difficult to find any industry that would not consider itself injured by having its products included in a reciprocity treaty, this part of the message is practically meaningless, Mark'Hanna's pet measure, the ship subsidy bill, receives an indirect boost. The president does not men tion the bill, but he says that Ameri can shipping is under great disadvan tages, and among these be mentions the fact that many of the foreign fast ships are subsidized, and later on he says that these inequalities must be remedied. The gold standard receives unstinted praise, and "elasticcurrency in-tions directly mentioned as a desideratum. Some slight reduction in the revenues of the country it deemed a Ivlsable.

The interstate commerce law needs some amendments for the regulation of railroads, but again the warning 1B sounded not to do anything that might interfere with the "development and operation of these commercial agen cies." Forestry reserves, water storage works and irrigation of arid lands are strongly recommended. Reciprocity with Cuba is recom mended. The Filipinos should be given self-government as soon as they are fit {or it, but at present they are not fit for even such measure of self government as we have given them. Franchises should be given to capital for the development of the natur al resources of the islands. A sub marine cable to Hawaii and the Phil ippines is a necessity, and should either be constructed by the govern ment or under government control. The immediate construction of an isthmian canal is urged. The Monroe doctrine is re-affirmed. A strong navy and efficient army are considered necessary for the maintenance of our new position as a world power. The efficiency of the army can best beef fected by adopting a merit system of promotion instead of the seniority basis. The tribal relations of the In dians ought to be severed and each one treated as an individual. It should be the aim of the government to give them an industrial education and make them self-supporting. 

GAGE'S ANNUAL REPORT. From the annual report of the secre tary of the treasury we cull the fol lowing: Receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, $699,816,530 ex penditures, $621,598,546 surplus, $77, 717,984. Estimated income for current year, $688,633,042 estimated expendit ures, $588,633,42 estimated surplus, $100,000,000. Value of imports for the year, $823,172,165 export*, $1,487,764, 991. Excess of exports over imports during the past four years, $2,453,618, excess of gold imports over ex ports during the same period, $165, 590,235, leaving, $2,288,028,067 worth of exports for which no money has been returned to this country. The vast amount of American securities and. bonds held abroad have undoubt edly absorbed the greater part of this in interest charges and payments The secretary favors the adoption of the Stickney plan of a large- central bank with numerous branch banks, but acknowledges that this idea is So offensive to the American people that it will probably be impossible to it adopted. He therefore suggests that the banks form a federation and establish a common surplus bank, with the power to loan necessary por of this surplus to banks in any portion of the country where more money were needed. He also pro poses an amendment to the national banking law, enabling such banks to above is a few articles which we carry in silver and ebony.

Upon depositing with the* U. S. treasurer government bonds equal to 30 per cent of their capital and U. S. legal tender notes equal to 20 per cent of their capital. For this privilege the banks should pay semi-annually one-eight of one per cent on their capital stock, to be used as a fund for paying notes of in solvent banks. The "benefits" to come from this change are as follows: SOME $200,000,000 I N GREENBACKS WOULD E WITHDRAW N FROM CIRCU- LATION and impounded in the U. S. treasury about $60,000,000 in govern ment bonds would be released for sale in the general market TO TH E AD VANTAGE OP THE PRIVATE INVESTOR, about $300,000,000 additional bank currency would be put into circula tion the remaining $146,000,000 of greenbacks would be more than cov ered by the gold reserve, and thecially greenbacks would practically become GOLD CERTIFICATES. The interest bearing debt of the United States on Nov. 15, 1901, amounted to $9*4,027,. 150. The cash fund in the treasury on the same day was $322,514,732. "An issue of tremendous conse quence is thus being brought to the whole country. It is a matter for con jecture if these railroad and financial manipulators comprehend what this issue is. The failure of full and ef fective government regulation which the roads have so far succeeded in breaking down means government ownership, nothing less than that. And toward just that conclusion the combinations are forcing the country. It will be a great mistake to suppose that the present patience of the people with the growing domination of mo-miles—via nopoly, is a test of what the public tem per Will always prove to be." The above clipping is from the Chi cago Tribune, one of the leading re publican papers of the country. Had we read that a little over a week ago we should have rejoiced to think that the dominant party in the land was awakening to the fact that something effective must be done to check the growth of monopoly. But now, alas, we know better. W have heard the man who next to Justice Brown, has the most power declare that these gigan tic combinations are a blessing, that nothing must be done to hinder their growth, and that anyone who tries to stir up discontent with existing con ditions is an anarchist. If the editor of the Chicago Tribune does not stop "Sowing the seeds of discontent" and advocating such populistic remedies he Will lay himself liable, to deporta tion to the proposed anarchist island colony. .'.•"-•..•••,-• Publicity in the affairs of trusts would undoubtedly be a good thing for the investors, but how'.. would it prevent the trusts from extorting money from the people? Some of the largest trusts, like the Standard Oil Co., for instance, make no secret of the fact that they are paying annual dividends nearly equaling the capital up 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 44 a Jewelers teo* *M* stock no one doubts that this comes from charging extortionate prices. But has anything been done to stop it? It has built up its monopoly by the aid of railroad discrimination. Can any amount of publicity do away with that? It may be possible to prevent discrimination in rates, but there are other forms of discrimination that cannot be reached, such as delays in furnishing cars or delivering them at the proper time, etc. A long as the railroads are owned by private mo nopolies they can help, or hinder a business at their own sweet will, and in oases like the Standard Oil Co. and the steel trust, where the owners are also the controlling spirits in the great railroad combine, they can har ass opposing interests until they either quit the business or join the trust. The talk of publicity will not scare any but the "wild cat" 'trusts, espe when the talk of it comes from a party that places the welfare of the trusts above the welfare of the people. Minneapolis merchandise rate to the Red River valley is 100 per cent, high er than the Iowa distant traffic rate for the same distances. Wheat rate via the Great Northern from Moor head to Minneapolis is two cents high er than rail route to Chicago, 200 miles further. J. J. Hill charges 24 cents per 100 more to haul wheat 700 miles to Du luth than the Chicago roads charge to haul 700 miles from Dakotas to Chi cago. Great Northern charges Twin City jobbers as much to carry goods 250 miles into the Red River valley as the Southern roads charge to carry 450 to 500 miles into Missouri. Minneapolis rate to Fargo —240 the Great Northern Rail way is the same as Chicago rate to Sioux Falls, 554 miles. Great Northern rates between the Twin Cities and points northwest are 40 to 100 per cent, higher than Chica go rates into connective territory for same distances.—Minneapolis Times. With the above in view, it will be hard for the avesage person to believe that the railroad combination will be to the interest of the people. Compe tition is the only thing that can keep a check on Jim Hill's rapacity. Those republican editors who have so loudly been advocating tariff re form for some months will now have to take a vacation long enough to col lect their thoughts after the jolt given them by Roosevelt. Then we shall probably hear them all shouting for protection "with the same vigor with which they lately advocated reduction of the tariff. The democrats will then most likely pick up the issue, using the arguments that the aforementioned republican editors have been using, and we will have an old-fashioned fight on the tariff issue, while the really important issues of the day are rele gated to the rear as far as the old parties are concerned. The census reports of manufactur ing industries in Minnesota shows some startling figures. In 1890 the ti^dlimMi average yearly wages of persons em ployed in those industries was $435 in 1900 it was S459, an increase of about five and one-half per cent. In 1890 the profits to the owners on the products of 'each man's labor was $444, or nine dollars more than the laborer's wages in 1900 the profits on each laborer was 9524, or 465 more than the laborer received. Profits in creased 18 per cent. The cost of liv ing has increased more than the in crease in wages. Wh enjoys the prosperity. What! Has Minnesota's governor «'turned populist'' too? In Wisconson any man Or official who expresses a belief that the general public has a right to protect itself against the en croachments of trusts and combines and that party platforms are in any manner binding on the organizations making them, is straightway branded as a wild eyed populist in fact a first cousin to anarhy.—Vernon Co. (Wis Censor. The Minnesota Railroad Commis sion has given up the idea of going to Washington to consult with the Inter state Railroad Commission. They probably happened to think that there were dead bodies nearer at hand. The interstate commission was killed by the Supreme Court years ago, but the corpse has been kept above ground to give the men in charge of it an oppor tunity to keep on drawing salary. It is reported from Washington that on account of the recent decision of the supreme court the authorities are all at sea as to whether we have any laws governing the Philippines.
