Entered Ht the Poet Office for Transmission in the Mails at Second-Class Batea. Legislative Gossip. Senator Preston introduced a bill pro viding for the appointment of a commit tee to locate the agricultural college, no two of whom shall be residents of the same county. It is said that this bill has the support of the majority of the senate and also the house, but as the commission is to meet at Waitsburg it would seem that it was not intended to be in the interests of Whitman. The representatives from this county are too jealous of each other to accomplish much for the county at large, and we need not bo much surprised if Whitman will "get in the soup" as usual. 7*ll has been tho practice of county and state officials to deposit the funds of their office in banks and draw interest thereon, which they of course appropri ated to their own " behoof and benefit." To prevent this pernicious habit a bill has passed tho senate and should become ■ law. Senator Farias introduced a resolution that a committee bo appointed to ascer tain the needs of state officers in the way of furniture and fixtures, and a bill pro hibiting public officers investing public funds for private purposes. The report of the code commission has been indefinitely postponed, and the committee on the code wrote to W. Laird Hill asking him how much it i would cost to compile an annotated code, and asking him how long it would take and tho probable costs. Mr. Hill re plied that it would take a year to com pile it and the probable costs to the state would be 320,000. Ho offered to do the work and supply tho state with what it required for $10,000, provided ho was given the exclusive privilege of selling to citizens tho code for the next six years. A bill h:;s passed the senate prohibit ing the formation of trusts or combina tions by corporations for the purpose of lixing the price or limiting the produc tion, or regulating the transportation of any product or commodity. Section 7, which reads as follows, caused consider able contention: -Tho provisions of this act shall not apply to agricultural products or live stuck while in the hands of tho producer or raiser, nor to tho ser yiees of laborers or artisans who are formed into societies or organizations for the benefit and protection of their mem bers." But this section was finally re tained. Senators Fariss, Lawrence nnd j Whallej voted for tho bill. Thompson, of Walla Walla, intro duced, in tho senate, q memorial to Con gress asking that tho lands withheld from settlement sinco August IH7O, for the benefit of the N. P. railway, be granted to tho state. The house refused to adopt tho adverse report of the committee on the bill reg ulating the exchange of Hour for wheat by grist mills. Ostrander introduced a bill giving the owners of studs a lieu on the offspring by tiling the proper affidavit with the auditor. He also introduced a bill pro viding for a penalty for false representa tions as to the pedigree of any animal kept for breeding purposes. The house are home protectionists by a vote of 13 to 21. They favored the printing of tho supreme court reports b}' printers of tlto state of Washington. A bill has been introduced in the house appropriating $2,4)00 for four ar tositm wells in Yakima county. The ter ritorial legislature of Itißs appropriated 8 r>,5()0 for tho same purpose without success. The bill which passed the house pro hibiting the sale of cigarettes or cigars to persons under the ago of 18, is not favored by the senate. The most expeditious legislation done ■o far was the senate bill authoriz ing supreme court judges to sol emnize marriages. The bill bassed both houses with an emergency clause which was claimed to be in the interest of Sen ator Landers, who is about to be :u;ir ried and desires Judge Hoyt to perform the ceremony. It only required two days to put it through both houses. A bill has been introduced in the son- ate and on.? in the house providing for a uniform system of education; it treats of the disposal of school lands. It fol lows the Indiana law which is said to bo the best in the United States. It is es timated that in twenty years from now the Echools of tho stato will have S'2o, --000,000 of a fund derived from the sale of lands if these lands are properly handled; at 0 per cent, interest this would give a yearly income of 8120.000. AVhalley introduced a bill in the sen ate providing for a state printer to be elected every four years. His duties will be to do the printing of the state. Herren. of Lewis introduced a bill for a university to be located at or near Se attle, to be called "The University of Washington." The house bill regulating primaries wrs defeated by a vote of 29 to 29. It would .seem that thero are a few members who have some original thoughts, and as soon as they introduce a bill tho others follow suit by introduc ing similar bille, just as if tho subjects of legislation were scarce. Washington Clly News. In a letter dated December 6th, our correspondent says: The president left here to-day for a short western trip. After visiting Chi- cago he will go to Indianapolis and at tend to some important private business before returning to Washington. Judge David J. Brewer, of Kansas, has been nominated by the president to be associate justice of the supreme court to fill the vacancy caused by tho death of tho late Justice Stanley Matthews, of Ohio. Judge Brewer is a nephew of Justice Stephen J. Field of the supreme court; he has been since 1884 United States Judge for the eighth circuit of Kansas. He has filled a number of im portant positions in Kansas, judicial and otherwise, and has always been a popu lar ofiieial. The nomination is highly pleasing to Senators Ingalls and Plumb, and in fact to everybody, with tho pos sible exception of several disappointed candidates and their immediate friends. Justice Miller, over whoso circuit Judge Brewer has presided for tho last five years, says ho considers him one of the ablest judged now on the bench with his Uncle Justice Field; it will bo the first time in the history of the court when two of the contemporary justices have been BO nearly related. Owing to the organization of the House on Monday the precedent's mes sage was not read to congress until Tu< ■■-- day. The message has been well re ceived by everybody except a handful of Southerners who profess to see in its plain statement of the condition of polit ical affairs in the south cause for alarm. The message is strictly conservative, both in tone and in ils recommendations, be ing thereby in striking contrast to the last dictatorial documents sent from the White House to Congress. Mr. Harrison evidently intended this message to be confined to its strict constitutional limits —that of informing Congress of i In state of the country. Its recommenda tions are in every instance what lias been approved by the republican party. I'p op those things on which there are dif ferent opinions in the party, he has pre sented the facts without recommendation. It is a document that has greatly disap pointed the democrats because it furn ishes them with no ammunition. Next in importance to the president's message is Secretary Windom's annual report to Ccngress,'v.hich was made pub lic on Wednesday. Mr. Windom covers the entire financial field and furnishes one of the most interesting as well as important reports of the kind ever made. It presents a plan for the satisfactory solution of the silver problem, which Mr. Windom believes wiii be accepted by both silver and gold men. Space pre vents further notice of the report, but it should bo carefully read !>v every intelli gent citizen of the country. It may be obtained by addressing Secretary Win dom. The organization «,r the house was at tended by v little circumstance that Bhowa the danger which will constantly menace the majority during tho session. After Reed had been elected speaker, McPhereon, clerk; Holmes, sergeant-at arms; Adams, doorkeeper, and Wheat, postmaster, Representative Henderson, as chairman of the republican canons, nominated ll,>v. C. 13. Ramsdeil for Chap bin. Representative Cheadle, of Indiana, bolted tho caucus nomination, moved to strike out the name of Mr. Ramsdelland substitute that of Dr. Milburn, tho blind preacher who was chaplain of the last house. Mr. Cheadle was supported out right by three republicans, Moore, of New Hampshire; Lehblack, of JJew Jer sey, and Ewart of North Carolina, and enough refrained from voting to elect Dr. Milburn, who recioved Ifi6 votes to Mr. Ramsdelfs 165, tho democrats vot ing solidly for Milbnrn. This is of it self a small thing, but if the party cau cus can bo successfully bolted in small things there is nothing to prevent it bs ing dono when Homcthiug important is at stake. Secretary Noble has gone to St. Louis, his former homo, to look after some private matters. He is expected back early next week. The copper trust collapsed last spring; the Liverpool cotton trust has followed suit. Given rope and time and the great est trust will destroy itself at last, ap parently. The two most flourishing or ganizations of this kind in America are now the cotton seed oil trust and the su^ar trust. The American Economist, high tariff, thinks it is probably true that the day for tho manufacture of the lower grades of iron work in the eastern states has passed. These have already gone to the south and west, in The Economist's judgment, so that even free iron ore. coal and coke will not save them to the eastern states. Sir Edwin Arnold said he admired tre mendously the vivacity, push and dash of American newspapers, and bethought they would be about perfect if they were more serious and dignified. But if they were more serious and dignified theyi would not have their "vivacity, pusli and dash." They would be as dull, in | short, as London newspapers.

The Northern Pacific has just received twenty new colonial sleepers from Bar ney, Smith & Co. that are models of beauty, convenience and comfort, and contain many improvements over the ordinary ootoßist sleeper, or so railed tourist-car. generally in use. Each car has fourteen sections, with gentlemen's toilet room in one end, and tho ladies' room, supplied with marble-topped wash stand and force pump, in the other. In one end of the car is a Baker fire-proof heater, which heats the car by means of hot water conducted through pipes. In the opposite end of the car is a cooking range surrounded by good kitchen facil ities. Opposite this range isa twenty gallon cooler for drinking water; also a large tank, holding seventy gallons of water (m general use. a cars are finished in natural croods, ash, maple and butternut. — beautifully polished, and at night are Lighted up with eight Acme lamps exact ly similar to those in use in Pullman sleepers, Tho sections are divided by sliding hoad-boarde, effecting a privacy not possible in the present style of cars wh-'re the sections are divided by a wire netting. An ingenious arrangement of the seats enables them to be extended flat <n- with head rests when prepared for bedding, and under each seat is a box in which can be stored bedding or small baggage In each section there is also provided^ movable table similar to those in use in Pullman cars, which is extreme ly convenient for many purposes. All cars are provided with curtain rods. Notwithstanding the fact that the Northern Pacific employs a porter to look after these sleepers, all holdera of second class Montana and Pacific Coast tickets are allowed to use them freo of charge. Tho Northern Pacific has a greater cumber of these sleepers in serv ice than any other transcontinental line, their total equipment now amounting to 03 cars. It is clear that in providing for the comfort of the traveling public tho Northern Pacific, with its new visti buled duing and sleeping cars and superior accommodations for second class passengers, leads all competitors. -The Independent. 2m
