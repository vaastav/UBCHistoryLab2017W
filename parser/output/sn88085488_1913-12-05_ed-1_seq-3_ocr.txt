H-" — ■ — — _. Pullman, Wash., Friday, December 5, 1913 A FRIENDLY MESSAGE President Wilson's message to digress this week was concise and ..inted. He devoted a considerable ;ortion of it to discussing the condi ::ons of the farmers and bis words .dicate that he appreciates the :andicap under which the tillers of :re soil have been laboring and the :ecessity of legislation in their be :alf. The part of his message re nting to this subject was as follows: "The farmers, of course, ask and _ould be given no special privilege, itch as extending to them the credit 1 the government itself. What they eed and should obtain is legislation >hich will make their own abundant ad substantial credit resources vailable as a foundation for joint, oncerted local action in their own .half in getting the capital they ittst use. It is to this we should ow address ourselves. "It has, singularly enough, come i pass that we have allowed the in- Mtry of our farms to lag behind the -.her activities of the country in its rvelopment, 1 need not stop to tell ou how fundamental to the life of le nation is the production of its Md. "Our thoughts may ordinarily be oncentrated upon the cities and the Ives of industry, upon the cries of lie crowded market place and the Bangor of the factory, but it is from he quiet interspaces of the open alleys and the free hillsides that we ' 'aw the sources of life and of pros tarity, from the farm and the ranch, rom the forest and the mine. "Without these every street would I silent, every office deserted, very factory fallen into disrepair, ad yet the farmer does not stand Don the same footing with the for mer and the miner in the market of "edit.

And the security I « gives is of a character not known I J the broker's office or as familiar | 1 as it might be on the counter of kfl banker. | "The agricultural department of ie government is seeking to assist » never before to make farming an Sclent business, of wide co-oper- Ive effort, in quick touch with the arkets for foodstuffs. The farmers j id the government will henceforth j ork together as real partners in this I eld where we now begin to see our ay very clearly and where many in- Ulgent plans are already being put to execution. "The treasury of the United States as, by a timely and well considered 'stribution of its deposits, facilitated a 8 moving of the crops In the pres at season and prevented the scarcity ' available funds too often export ac ed at such times. But we must °t allow ourselves to depend upon *traordinary expedients. We must jd the meansuby which the farmer a J make his credit constantly and j ; slly available and command, when I ' will, the capital by which to support and expand his business. "We lag behind many other great countries of the modern world in at tempting to do this. Systems of rural credit have been studied and developed on the other side of the water while we left our farmers to shift for theimselves in the ordinary money market. You have but to look about you in any rural district to see the result, the handicap and embar rassment which have been put upon those who produce our food. "Conscious of this backwardness and neglect on our part the congress recently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the vari ous systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Eu rope, and this commission is already prepared to report. Its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what methods will be best suited to our own farmers. "I hope and believe that the com mittees of the senate and house will address themselves to this matter with the most fruitful results, and I believe that the studies and recently formed plans of the department of agriculture may be made to serve them very greatly in their work of framing appropriate and adequaet legislation. It would be indiscreet and presumptious in anyone to dog matize upon so great and many-sided a question, but I feel confident that common counsel will produce the re sults we must all desire." A 

GREAT ADVANTAGE One great advantage which the people residing In Pullman enjoy is the opportunity to hear high class music rendered by real artists. Be cause they can hear this music free, or for a nominal charge, some people are prone to underestimate the priv ilege, for they measure the worth of what they hear by the standard of what it costs. They think that be cause the people of Spokane paid $5000 for the Melba-Kubellk con cert, it must have been something wonderful, while, as a matter of fact, they can for 25 cents hear as good a concert by Herr Herbst and .Mrs. llerbst next Friday evening. Competent critics assert that Mrs. Herbst has a better voice than the Melba of today and that she has been fully as well trained in its use. There are but three or four organ ists in the United States who can play as well as Dr. Ernst A. Evans, and yet every other Sunday the resi dents of this city can hear him with out money and without price. In any other town the size of Pullman it would be Impossible to hear such music and in any of the large cities it would cost a good many dollars each year. Pullman people are ex ceptionally fortunate to have in their midst such talented musicians as Mr. and Mrs. Herbst, Professor Kim brough and Dr. Evans and they should not underestimate the privi lege of hearing them simply because it costs little or nothing. The class of music which they render and the v. ay in which they render it is an inspiration. It not only cultivates a taste for good music, but develops the ability to discriminate between what la worth while aud what is mediocre or worse. The opportunity to hear the best works of the greatest composers in terpreted by real artists is one of the most important factors in making Pullman a desirable place in which to live. ORIGIN OF THE YULE LOG The origin of the Yule log in Vir ginia is told in the Pictorial Review lor December by the widow of the famous Confederate general, George _. Pickett. One time on old black man was sitting in his little cabin ou a moun tain side on Christmas Eve listening to the cold waul bowl over a world of snow and Wishing that he had a Tire to warm him, when be heard the cry of a little child away out in the cold. The old man hobbled to the door and looked out across the snow and the wind came rushing in and made him shiver so that his "ouliest two tee£" chattered with cold. Again the cry came across the snow aud be wished with all his power of longing that he could go out and find the un it rtunate little one; for the plaintive cry of a little child always goes straight to the heart. A third time the cry came and a miraculous pcwer seemed to fill the old man's veins. His muscles became tense and strong and he stepped from the threshold into the snow, the crutch falling back into the cabin. In an instant lie was walking over the expanse of frozen snow with an activity he had not possessed since he used to "go ter camp meetin'." By and by he came to a little child caught in a snowbank. lie lifted the child and as its little form touched him a new strength came into him and the small burden seemed to give him wings to speed back to the little cabin. He put the child on the bed, drew the ragged quilt around it and looked about to see if there might be a piece of furniture of which he could make a fire to warm his small guest. At that instant, he saw a great log roll across the threshold and Into the fireplace. The little child was looking at it with eyes like stars and they sent gleams of light that kin dled the log with the most brilliant fire the old man had ever seen, and the dingy little room was filled with radiance and warmth that brought a glow to the soul as well as to the body and seemed to flood the world with light. As the light wrapped the child in a shining glory he laughed a laugh that was like a song of the heart and floated up and away. The old man turned his eyes to where the fire burned and watched the flames leap in opalescent tints over the log form ing the shape of a cross in fire. Application No. 0135 NOTICE <>!
