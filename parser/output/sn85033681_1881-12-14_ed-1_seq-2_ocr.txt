The Teiinesseo Legislature has 100 members 75 in the House and 25 in the h'enate. This number may be increased, under the late census, to 99 in the House and 33 in the Senate. Jf the latter basis is chosen there will one representa tive to each 3,477 votes. A dispatch from Nashville to the Chattanooga Times gives the follow ing as the legislative committee on redisricting the State : Senators Duggan, Cason, Smith, Perkins Coleman, .Alexander and Bell. Jiep resentatices Butler, Manson, Calort Hawkins, Coulter, Harrison, Rhodes, Cox, Wilson, Garr and Reoder. The Senate adopted a resolution to in crvase the membership of the legis lature to 132, and passed a bill on its third reading authorizing the comities to settle their liabilities. THE PRESIDENTS MESS A OE. The first annual message of Presi dent Arthur was read to Congress on the 5th. It is a voluminous document, and its main features will bo more generally read in a con densed form. It begins with an ap propriate and feeling allusion to the calamity sustained by the country in the tragic death of his predeces sor, and to the touching manifesta tions of synipathj- and good-will which the sad occasion elicited from all the nations of the earth, and es pecially from the people and sov ereign of Great Britain. Brief men tion is made of the present state of diplomatic relations and intercourse with each of the foreign govern ments of the world, as well as of the participation of our own country in various international congresses and conferences. An epitomized state ment is furnished, taker from the report of the Secretary of the Treas ury, of the condition of the national finances and revenues. The first important recommendation of the message is in view of the large sur plus income of the government, and the prospective increase of that sur plus year by year, with the increase of population and the reduction of the public debt and its burden of interest. In view of the heavy load of taxation which our people have borne so long the President concurs with the Secretary of the Treasury in recommending the abolition of all internal revenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled spirits and fer- j mented liquors, and the special tax upon manufacturers and dealers in these articles. Any present reduc tion in the tax upon liquors and to bacco is deemed premature in yiew of the drain upon the treasury which must attend the payment of arrears on pensions. The retirement of the outstand ing 'Silver certificates" is recom- to them by patent and made inalien able for 20 or 25 years; third, liberal appropriation for t he eupport of In dian schools. Additional legislation with a view to breaking up the revolting prac tice of polygamy in Utah is strong ly recommended. The largest space devoted to any one topic in the message is that given to the subject of civil service reform. The President prefaces what he has to say upon this sub ject by quoting from and reaffirm ing certain passages in his letter of acceptance of the nomination for the vice-presidenc. The history of civil service reform in England is briefly reviewed, and the main prin ciples of the English civil service system explained. While declarin his readiness to second any measure of reform which Congress may adopt, the President points out some of the practical difficulties which many advocates of reform have been in the habit of overlook ing or making light of, and shows the necessity of proceeding with caution and deliberation. Th whole discussion of the subject in the message is intelligent and dis criminating, and will be read with interest by the public. The entire document is sensible and business like in its statements and sugges tions, dignified in tone, and written in simple direct English. It is en tirely free from any flavor of "stal wartism," or partisanship of any kind, and, in short, every way wor thy of the high office which ilr Arthur has been so unexpectedly and suddenly called upon to fill. The City Council of Knoxville has forbidden the sale of parlor matches," and the Charleston Ex change lias condemned the use of all matches except the lucifer, or old sulphur matches. In speaking ot Blaine's resigna tion we glean the following from a G ORE . A T

Immediately after roll call in the Sen ate, Speaker Morgan called Matthews to the chair and proceeded to speak on a question of personal privilege, review ing the agitation over the debt settle ment, and declaring that in casting the deciding vote he Lad acted conscien tiously. The passage of the bi'l was followed by charges of bribery. lie concluded, "1 pronounce the charges ii.fitmously and maliciously false, ema nating ftom the spirit of the arch fiend aud another the eon of an illustrious sire. I denounce every insinuation no matter who from, as false, slanderous, villainous and infamous, in view of the premises and in behalf of my family, my wife and my children, who are to wear my name. In behalf of my con stituents, in behalf of the members of the Senate of the Republican and Dem ocratic parties, I demand a full and thorough investigation of the charges against me." Mr. Smith, of Fentress, rose, and af ter speaking in a similar strain, and de manding an investigation, said in con elusion: "1 understand that a man mak ing charges against me is in this house. Dele's the man John J. Vertrees who comes before the courts and utters lies about me which are as false as the devil himself. I don't Impose on the hum blest creature, and ko one can impose on mp. I denounce him as a liar, who acted un professionally, and I will be sustained by all the sensible lawyers in this country Senator Barrett followed to the same effect Eell offered a resolution of the Joint Committee to investigate the charges. Pending the discussion, the Senate ad journed till 2 p. m. Humors of these speeches were cir culated to-night, and the Senate cham ber was filled with the friends of all parties. Feariug a collision, six police was sent for. Smith and Morgan patsed down to the Mixwell House together, Smith about 12:30 was sitting in the rotunda of the hotel reading a paper when Ve it reef slapi.ed Smith on the arm and placing a pistol close to his shoulder fired Smith rose and while at tempting todrav a pistol turned into a buiber shop.

To th Editor of Th Morristown Gazette: 5 A "first performance," be it theatri cal or parliamentary, always forms a great attraction for the spectacle loving Washicgtonians. It wns, therefore, not surprising, on last Monday, to find the galleries of the House crowded within, and its portals surrounded by a throng of eager sightseers, intent on taking stock of the new Congress. On ccca 810118 like this, I almost cease to oewail the unbappy lot of a journalist, for, no matter how crowded the special galler ies reserved for the families and friends of members, for diplomats, or the one filled by the profanum vulgus, your correspondent wages his way through the jammed lobbies, and tht dense excluded throng that is stiiviug to catch a glimp-e through the windows, with an assurance that ho will find a good point of view in the gallery occu pied by what Gen. B. F. Butler once designated "the forty jackass power wind machine of the press." But this gallery, for which all members of Con gress have a wholesome fear, is very exclusive, for there ate quacks, snides, and charlitons in this holy profession also. Every correspondent is required to file his credentials, which must state, over the signature of the Editor, that he is the authorized Washington cor respondent of his paper. If these cre dentials receive favorable action from a committee appointed by the House, he is given a ticket, signed by the Speaker, which entitles him to a seat in the He porters' Gallery for that session. The way to the Iieporteis' Gallery of the Senate is equally difficult, and, in each application, the petitioner must sign a paper stating that he is not a clerk i: any Government office, and will not be interested in the prosecution of any claim against the Government. Having been duly admitted the correspondent has a position facing tho House or Sen- i;

The tiro was get along pretty ill, for such sublimity of impoliteness has, with help of nat ural bias, seldom been achieved, as that shown by a Washington journalist when anyone asks him a question. I have long since been through a novitiate, and know how it is. There is nothing unusual in the or ganization of the present House. -Speaker Keifer was no sooner in the chair than half a dozen members commenced talking to the remote inds of wires and p t routes, on points of order, privil ege, proceedure, and like questions of little importance. An almost inextri cable parliamentary tangle resulted, and the new Speaker exhibited more pa tience than skill in his efforts to man age the unruly House. Messrs. Robe son, of New Jersey, and Haskell, of Kansas, fenced for the It'puhlican lead ership. Ex-Speaker Randall and S. S. Cox, for the leadership ot the Demo crats. Mr. Katson locked on in si lence from a remote seat, thinking, pei haps, how much better he could wield the gavel than Mr. Keifer, or, if this thought did not occur to him, it did to almost everyone present. On Tuesday, the same disorderly scenes weie repeat ed, and the outlook is not peaceful for the new Speaker. The House adjourn ed until Friday, and the committees will probably not be known until next week. The Senate met, duly organize 1, and on the second da', while the House was still in the throes of confusion, were listening to the President's message, read by the clerk of the Senate from pa per heavily bordered with black. caused by a convict throwing a piece of hot iron into a tub filled with pitch.

PREDICTIONS FOR DECEMBER. Vennor, tho Canadian weather prophet, gives this detailed sketch of the weather we are to have dur ing the month of December : 1, 2, 3. Storms or indications of storms in Atlantic, and cold, blustry weather at Xew York, Boston and other seaboard cities ; snowfalls in the middle and Northern States and Canada ; very cold weather West Probably a brief mild term. 7 to 11. Generally very cold weather, probably commencing and ending with snowfalls in JNorthern. middle and western sections, bleak and stormy weather South. 13 and 14. Probably milder in all sectious, with rains South and West to a limited extent. 15 to 20. Very cold and blustry period, with snowfalls where these were experienced in lb0 and le0, tho 19th and 20th probably being t'.ie days most marked in this re spect ; intense cold in Canada and t ic xew Jbngland States. 2o. Christmas has a cold and stormy period both before and after it, but tuo day itself majjust escape. 2G to 31. After tho 2btli 1 see nothing but cold, snow and bluster to the ckso of the year for Canada tud much of the United States, West and South, tho month prob ably resembling, in many respects, the Decembers of 180 and 1880. As to the intensity or degree of these snowfalls, I have no very defi nite indication, but ain strongly inj. pressed in the direction of low tem peratures for the foro part of the ap proaching winter season. But January will have its "thaw" this - time, and probably a very marked one. ' Punched Coin. Merchants and dealers every where are refusing to take at face, silver coins with holes in tliom, but wo hear of very few people who do not feel willing to take ii bottle of Winslow's Vcrmlfugo, if thoy ncod anything of the kind for their chil dren, at the regular price of 25c per bottle, and it is well worth the money. to receive frequent applications from BUSINESS MEX who wish to em ploy STUDENTS, also when lead ing MERCHANTS and others pur- cnase us stociv at a premium; 4. Is it not commendable for such an institution to place its advan- tages within tne reach ot j'oung men in ALL PAliTS OF THE SOUTH, by establishing at consid erable cost, a chain of such institu tions ? 5. Is it not better for a school to refer to the numerous applications from business men, than for it to say "we teach the best commercial course in the South ?" Goodman's College has no Threk Months or Partial Course. Hence the success of our Students. It surely could not bo reasonably expected that any college could take the average young man and in three months pronounce him to be an intelligent and competent ac countant. Having had to educate him in Commercial Calculations, tho Laws of Contracts, Negotiable Pa per and the like, a rapid Business Handwrite, Business Correspon dence, Book-keeping in its various forms, both by Singleand Double Entry, as applied to General Mer chandising, Wholesale, Commission, Banking and other kinds of busi ness, and go through the actual Business Department and the min ute details of business in three mouths. A MISTAKEN IDEA. This idea of becoming an account ant in three months and less time has produced damaging results. It has caused many business men to look with contempt on Business Col leges, as they believed it impossible for young men to thoroughly master uhe commercial branches in so short a time; and young men themselves, who attend College so short a time, generally go home feeling afraid to risk themselves in business or with a firm's books. It would be better not to have a cent of their money than to take part of it, and not suf-ficientlj- qualify them as accountants that they may be able to earn back the money invested in their busi ness education. Time Requlred-Tho timo re quired complete the Course depends entirely upon tho Student's applica tion and ability. A Student who coaipiete's in four months is a bright student, and has wasted no time. No student need be discouraged in five months, for thatis a reasonable time. Whilo'any Student who expects to do much, when he comes in contact v ith the active business world. ... .... ought to complete m six months.
