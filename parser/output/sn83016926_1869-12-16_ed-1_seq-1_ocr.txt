L nuer this author ty election- ere called In v lrtrinia. The election tool- ulace on the 0th of July, and a Governor am" Lieutenant Governor were elected and hav een installed. The Legislature met anil lid all required of them by this resolution ind by all the reconstruct ion acts of Con .jress. They abstained from all doubtfu lUthority. 1 recommend mat lier senator ind Representatives be promptly admitted q their seats, and the Mate Ce fully restored o its place in the family ol States. Elections were called in Mississippi anf rexas to commence on the 30th of Novem ber; two davs in Mississippi and four nay n Texas. The elections have taken place. hut the result is not known. It is hope chat the acts of t ts Legislature of thest state, when they meet, will be such as to re- eive your approval, and thus close the work if reconstruction. Among the evils growing out of the re bellion and not yet referred to. is that of at inredeemable currency. It is an evil yvhicl I hope will receive your most earnest atten tion, it is a duty, anu one oi tne nigiiesi luties of the government, to secure to th itizens a medium of exchange of fixed am mvarying value. This implies a return t- i specie busis. and no substitute for it can b- levised. it suouiu oe commences now. am' eached at the earliest practicable moment, onsistent with a fair resard to the inter ists of the debtor class.

The methods t secure the former of these results areas nt - oerr.us as giieculators on political economy fo secure the latter. I see but one way, tha' s to authorize ties Jreaury to redeem its iwnpaperata fixed pru-a whenever pre- ented. and to wunnoiu min circulation an nrrencv so redeemed until sold attain for gold.

The subject of tariff and iuternal tax will rjssarily re ceive your attention. The revenue of the country are greater than the requirements, and may, with safety be reduced, but as the funding of the debt in a four or four and a half per cent, loan would reduce oar annu al current exposes largely, thus after fund ing a gi eater reduction ot taxation than would be now expedient, I suarirest the postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress. It maybe advisable to mcdi'y taxation and tariff In Instances where unjust or burdensome discrimina tions are made bv the oresentlaw, but as to a general revision ot the laws regulating this subject, I recommend a postponement tor the present. I alao sqggest the renewal of the tax on Income, bat at a reduced rate, ay three per cent-t ao3 this Ux to expire la tare yetrs, ma u i atcuig ox ue a aou- Y l"j H al debt as here suggested. I feel safe in say ing that taxes and revenue from import may be reduced safely from 60 to SO million lolUra per annum at once, and may be still further reduced from year to yer, as the re sources of the country are developed. The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury show the receipts of the Government for the fiscal 3-ear ending June 30th to be t370.943.747; expenditures, includinsr inter est on bonds, to be $32 140.587 The esti mates for the ensuing year are more favora ble to the Government, and will no doubt how a much larger decrease of public debt. The receipts in the Treasury b:jond expen iitures have exceeded the amount necessa ry to be placed to the credit f the sinking tunds as provided by law. To lock up the "iirplus in the Treasury and wi hhotd it from circulation would lead to such a con traction of currency as to cripjle trade and -enously afieet the prosperity of the coun try. Coder these circumstances the Secre tary of the Treasury and myself heartily onrurred in the propriety of using all the -urplus currency in the Treasury in the lurehase of Government bonds, thus r-.du-lucing interest bearing indebtedness of the country, and of submitting to Congress the juestion of the disposition to be made of he bonds so purchased. The bonds noyv held by the Treasurv amount to teveuty ive million, including those belonging to he Unking fund. I recommend that the vhole he placed to the credit ot the sinking 'und. Your attention is respectfully invited o the recommendation of t ie Secretary ot he Treasury for the creation of the ortice f commission of customs, revenue for iu reaseof the salary of certain classes of of icials. and the substitution ot increased ua ional bi nk circulation, to replace the out tanding 3 per cent, certificates, and moot 'pecially to his recommendation for the epeal of the laws allow iug bhares of finer, enalties, forfeitures, Ac, to otticers of the rovernment or informers. The office of Jommissioner of Internal Revenue is one ot he most arduous responsibilities under the rovernment. It falls a little short of a Cab net position in its importauee and respon ihilities. I would ask for it, therefore, such eolation as in your judgment w ill place lie otlice upon a footing of dis.ni'.y. com oensurate with its importance, and w ith the haraeter and qualification of the class ol iien required to till U properly. As the United States is the freest of all na ion. so too its people tiympuhize with all eople struggling for free liberty and selt ovemment. but while so s mpa'.hizitig it i. hie to our honor, that we should abstain om enforcing our views Uon unwilling ations and from taking an interested part vithout invitation in quarrels between dif erent nations or between governments and 'ieir subjects. Our course should always e in conformity w ith strict justice and law. uternational and lo -al. Such has been the olicy of the administration indealinir w ith tiese questioiiH tor more than a year. A a'uable province of Spain, and a near eighbor of ours in whom al. our people annot but feel an interest, has been etru ling for independence and freedom. The teople and government of the United States ntertain the same warm feelings and sym athies for the people of Spain in the pend ig struggle that, they manifested through ut the previous struggle between Spain ud her former colonies in behalf of the lat er, but the contest at no time ifsuuied the ondiuous which amount to war 111 the ense of international law or which would -how the existence ot a de facto political or :anization or insurrection sufficient to juti v a recognition of beligereney. The prin ciple is maintained, hoyvever. that this un ion is its own judge when to accord rights f belligerency, either to a people strug rliug to free themselves from a government hey believe to be oppressive, or to inde wiiflent nations at yvar with each other, rhe United States have no disposition to in erfere with Spafn and her colonial posses ions on this continent. They believe that n due time Spain anil other European pow rs will tind their interest in terminating hose relations, and establishing their pres nt dependencies as independent powers. riiese dependencies are no longer regarded is subject to transfer from one European jower to onother; yvnen the present rela ion of colonies ceases, they are to become ndependeut pow ers, exercising the right of hoice and of self control in the determina ion of their future condition and relations ith other poyvers The United States. In irder to put a stop to blood tied in Cuba and n the interest of a neighboring people, nro- jos1 good offices to bring the existing con gest to a termination, lne otter not being iccepted by Spain, the basis of which we ieved could be received by Cuba, was with Iraw n. It is hoped the good offices of the United States may yet prove advantageous or a settlement of this unhappy strife, vlean while a number of illegal expediiions igainst Cuba have been broken up. and it tas been the endeavor of the administra ion to execute the neutrality laws no mat er how unpleasant a ta-k it mav be. On he 20th of March last, the United States -cliooner Lizzie May was arrested on the ligh seas by a Spanish frigate and two pas sengers taken and carried as prisoners to 'uba. Rep-eseutations oe these facts were nade to the Spanish government as soon as -metal information readied V ashington. The two passengers wee set at liberty and he Spanish overiiiiient as-ured the United states that the Captain of the frigite in making the capture acted without law; that ie had been reprimanded, and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba would not sauc- 1011 any act that could violate the rights or rent, with disrespect the sovereignty of this nation. tne question of the seizure of the Mary Lowell, at B ahama, by the Spanish authori- ies is now a subject of correspondence he rween this government. Spain and Great Britain The Captain General of Cuba ibout May last, issued a proclamation au- horiz'uig tne search of vessels 011 high seas. vn immediate remonstrance was made igain-t this, whereupon the Captain-Gen eral issued a new proclamation limiting the search to vessels of the United Stat- s au horized under treaty of 17U5. This procla intiou was, however, immediately with Irawn. I have always felt that more inti mate relation should be cultivated between he United States and the independent na ions of this continent. It may be well Aorth considering whether new treaties be weeu the United States and them may not be profitably entered into to secure more in imate relations frieuuly, commercial and therwise. An interoceanio canal to connpet the At 'antic ami Pacific oceans through tjip Ith mus of D.trien, is one which commeic is greatly interested in. Instructions were given our minister to the United States of Columbia to endeavor to obtain authority tor a survey to determine the practicability of the undertaking. In order to comply with an agreement of the United Ststen to a mixed commission at Lima for the adjust nent of claims it became necessary to send t Commissioner and Secretary to Lima. The good offices of the United States to briny about peace between Spain and the South American repub ie having been accepted b Spain. Peru and Chili, a Congress ha been invited to be held in Washington next win ter. A grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has given its assent, which, it is alleged, conflict with the vested rights of the citi zens of the United. The Department ot State has now this subject under considera tion. Our Minister to Peru having made representation that there was a state of war between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing in or near New York thirty gun boats which might be used by Spain to relieve the naval force at Cuba and use it against Peru, orders were given to prevent their depaiture. No further steps have been taken by the representative of these vessels, and not feeling au'horized to d tain the property of m nation with which we are at peace, on a mere executive ordee the matter was referred to the courts. Thecon- duct ot the war between the allies of the Republic of Paraguay has made intercourse with that country difficult. It has been deemed advisable to withdraw our repre sentative from there. Toward the close of the last administration a convention was sicrned at London for outstandingclaimsbe- which failed to receive the advice and con sent of the Senate, Time and the circum stances attending the negotiations of that treaty were unfavorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States and its pro visions were wholly inadequate for a settle ment of the grave wrongs sustained by this Government.

Great, even, a 1 that difference, not a word was found in, he treaty and not an inference could be drarn from it to remove the sense of unfrlendltes of the course of Great Britain in our strg gle for existence of which it ha so deely and universally impressed itself upon he people of thi country. Believing th a convention thus mi conceived iu it sope and inadequate in its provision would tot haTe produced the hearty, cordial settlemct of the pending questions which alone is on sistent wilh. the relations which I belive have been firmly established betw-een he United States and Great Britain. I reg.rd the action of the Senate in rejecting- he treaty to have been wisely taken in the n tercst of peace and as a necessary stp in he direction of a perfec t cordial friendship le tween the two countries. A sensitive peo ple, conscious of their power, are more at ease under a great wrong whollv uuatoted than under a restraint, the settlement of which atisfie-i neither their ideas of justt-e. nor their grave sense ot tha grievance th?v have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was followed by a state of public opinions both sides tha 1 thought not favorable ton immediate attempt at a renewal of negoCa tions. I accordingly so instructed the Min ister of the Uuited States to Great Britain and found that mv views in this regard were shared by her Majesty's Minister. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two sfoverninents can approach the solution of this momentous question with an aporecia tion of what is due to tne rightAdignity and honor of each, aud with a determinntim not only to remove t 11 causes of complaint in the past, but to lay a foundation of hra principlesof puidic law -"hich will prevent future dillexence and tend to tinn and con tinued peace and friendship. This is now the only grave question which the United Stages hits with any foreisrn nation. The question of renew ing a treaty ftr re ciprocal trade between the United Stat sand the British provinces 011 this continent, has been favorably considered. In conformity with a recommendation of Consrr-6-i, proposition to abolish mixed courts tor the suppression of the slave trade, is under ne liotiatio.i. It havinf come to my knowledge that corporate company, organized under British ls. propo-ed Hi land iiion the shores of the United States, and to operate there, s submarine cable, under a concession from the Emperor of the French, of an exclusive right for twenty years, or telegraphic com munication between the shores of Franc- am! the United State, with a very obje tionable feature of subjecting all message-! conveyed thereby, to the scrutiny and con trol of the French government, I cmiseil the French and British legations at v ash ington. to be made acquainted with th pr bable p-dicv of Congress on this subject as fore-hadowed in a bill which passed th Senate in March la-t. This drew from tie representatives of the company an agree merit to accept as a basis of their operation the provisions ot the bill, anil such other enactment on the subject as might be paseii during the approaching session of C ingress also to use their influence to secure from the French government a moil ifieat ion oi rheir concession to permit the latu'ing 01 any cable belonging to any company inror oorated by the authority ot" the United stsites, or any State in the Union, and on their part not to oppose the establishment of any such cable, in consideration ofthi agreemei.t I directed the withdrawal of ah opposition of the United States to the land ing, until the meeting ot Congress. I regret to say there has been no modification made in the company's concession, nor so far as I can learu. have they attempted to secure one. The concession excludes the capital and citizens of the Unite I States from com petition upon the shores of France. I re commend legislation to protect all rights 01 citizens of the United States, against such an assumption. I shall also endeavor to se cure by negotiation, the abandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean telegraph'n eahl s. The unsettled political condition of other countries less fortunate than our own some times induces their citizens to come to u for the purpose of becoming naturalized. Having secured this they return to their native country and reside there without disclosing their changeof allegiance. They accept official positions of trust or honor, which can only be held by citizens of theii native lands, they journey under pasports describing thero as such citizens, and it is only when civil discord, after perhaps year of quiet, threatens their persons or their property, or when their native State drafts them into its military services that this change of allegiance is known. They resiih permanently away from the Uuited States contribute nothing to its revenues ; avoid the duties of citizenship, and only mak themselves known by a claim of protection. I have directed the diplomatic and cetiaiilai officers to scrutinize carefully allsucbcUiins ot protection. The citizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who dis charges his duty to his couuf y is entitled to its complete protection. While I haven voice in the direction of affairs. I shall 1101 consent to imperil thi. sacred right by con ferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimant. Invitations have been extended to the Cabinets of London, Paris. Florence. Berlin Brussels, the Hague. Copenhagen and Stock holm, to empower their representatives hi Washington to simultaneously enter int. negotiations and confer with the Uniteo States for a convention indicating a lorn for making uniform regulations as to th construction of the part of vessels to b devoted to the use 'of emigrant passenger.-; as to the quality and quantity of food ; as t the medical treatment of the sick and to tie rules to be observed during the voyage ii ord r to secure ventilation, to prou.oti health, to prevent intrusion and to proti c ttie female, and providing for the establish ment of tribunals iu the several countries and for enforcing such regulations by sum mary procesa. Your attention Is respectfully called tori e law regulating the tariff 011 Russian hemp. and tolhe question whether to fix the char ges on Kussiati hemp man tn. y are tixei upon manillo is not a violation of our treat) with Russia, idacii.g her products uion th. same footing with Itieseof the most favore nations. Our manufactures are uirreaainu w ith wouderiul rapidity under the eneoui- xgemeiit which they now receive, with tin improvement in machinery already effeetei aud still increasing, causing machinery t. lake tne place of skilled labor to a larg extent. Our imports of many articles mu fa I off largely w ithin a few years. Fortu lately too many lactone are uot coritineo to a tew localities as formerly, and it i-u be hoped will become more and more ditl'us. making the interest in them equal iu al t on. They give employment and sun p rtto hundreds of thousand of people ai h -iue and retain with us the means w lm-l e herwise would be shipped abroad. Th extension ot the railroad iu Europe and th. ea-t is bringing into competition w ith out agricultural products like products of otbei coui t-ies. Self-interest, if uut self-preser vatioo, therefore, dictates caution agains tue o siurbance of any industrial interest I the Country. It teaches u also, tht net essay of looking toother markets for the ale ot our surplus, our neighbor south of us, and Cniua and Japan, should receive our special attention. It w ill be the endea vor of the admmistr itiou to cultivate such relations with all these uationa a to entitle us to tbetr conndeuce, and make it theii interest, as welt as ours, to establish bettei commercial relation through the nvencv 01 a more enlightened policy than that here tofore pursuea. towards China it will be largely due to tha sagacity and effort of one ot our ainguished citizens. The world is about to belargelv i n creased with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As the United States have been the iuitwiory in this new policy, so they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a success In this con nection, 1 advise such legislation aa will forever preclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our sill uude- the name of Coolies, and also to prevent American ves sel from engaging In the transportation of tooues i any country tolerating the system I also leconuieud that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class rtn mv assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of the United States, it was with the conviction that these things were essen tial to iu peace, prosperity and fullest de velopment. First among these i strict In tegrity in fulfilling all our obligations; second, to secure protection to the person and property of the citizen of the United suites in eacn and every portion of oor common country, wherever La may choose to move, without reference to original na tlonall y. religion. eolor or oolitics, demand lug of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for the right of others; third, a Union of all the States with equal lights, inriestrucuble by any counstltution al means. To secure the first of Lhesn. Can. frees had taken two essential steps, first. In eclartug by joint resolution that the public debt shall be paid Driucioal tnd i coin. and neconaV by providing thomeAn tor paying, provming toe tnvana- could not Sec ore tha object aetrea without a nromi administration ol the law for Uu coi&sction of the revenues, and an economical disburse ment of them. To this subject the adminis tration has most earnestly addressed itself with rul ts. 1 hope satisfactory to the coun try. There ha been no hesitation in chang ing officials in order to secure an efficient execution of the laws, sometime too where in a mere partv view undesirable political result were likely to follow ; nor has there be?n any hesitation in sustaining efficient official aeaiost rwmonst ranees wholly po litical. It mwy be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from leav ing on the statute books the so-called tenure-of-offlee act and to earnestly recommend their total repeal. It could not have been the intention of the tramerof the Constitu tion when providing that aopnintujents made by the President should receive the consent of the Senate that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons placed there by federal appointments against the will of the preideut. The law i incon--istent with a faithful and efficient adminis tration of the Government. Vfhat faith can an executive put in officials forced upon tiitu and those too w liom he has suspended t How will such officials be likely to serve an administration which they know does not trust them? For the second requisite to our growth and prosperity time and a firm but humane administration of existing law amemled from time to time as they may be ineffective, or prove harsh and unneeessnrv. are probably all that are required. The third contract to be attained by SDfitl leg islation, but must be regarded as fixed by the Constirution itself, and gradually ac quiesced in by force ot public opinion' from me ourvlttion of the government to the present time. The 1'idianshave been a subject of embar rassment and expense, and their manage nent has been attended wi'h con'inuou robberies, murders and sir. From mv own experience uoon the frontiers and in Indian countries. I 1 not hold that either legisl.i tionor the w hites who com most in contact rc blameles for these hostilities. The past however, rail not be undone, ami the qui s tion must be met as we now find it. 1 hate I't-mpted a new policy toward these ward- f this nation, (they cannot be regarded in any other light than as wards.) with fair result ax tar at ried. and w hicn I hope will e attended ulti"iUely with great success riie soeicty of Friends is well know n as laving succeeded in having lived in peac with the Indians iu the early settlement in Pennsylvania while tin ir white brothers 01 ther sects in other set-lions were constant iv embroiied. T iey are eUo known tor their pposiuon ui an stnie, violence and war md are generally no'ed for their strict in 'egrit.v and fair dea'ing. Thee consider 'lonslnuuced me 'ogive the management fa few reservations of Indians to them, ind to throw the buideu of selections hjioii the society itself. The result has prov-n mst satisfactory. It w ill be found irton ully set forth iu the reort ott'e Commis--iontrof Indian affairs. For Siis rinii n. tents of Indians not on the reservation, ifficers of the army were se ected. 'In. asons for this arc numerous. Where tin Indians are sent there troops musr ln sen" 'Iso. The agent and commanders of troops ire independent i f each ther and Mil j- ci 0 orders f roiu different departments of ih iove nmeiir. The army officers holds a Misit on of life, the agent at lhe will ot the i'rrsMent. The former is personally iuter stec iu living iu harmony with the India" md in establishing pt rm anient peace to the nd that some portion of his life may be speit within the limits otcivilizid society. The latter has no such personal interest ncther reason is economy, and still anoth r tk hold which the government ha upon 1 lie officer to secure a faithful discharge of lisduiies in carrying out a given policy. The building of railroads aud the access hereby given to all the agricultural and ui ieral regions of the country is rapidly irfciging ciyilizatlou into contact with ali Ii tribesotTiidians. No matter w hat ought to ie the relations between such st ttlements .nd the Indians, the tart is 1 hey do not liar .noiii.e. and one or the other has to give way in the end. Any system or policy which ,ooks to the extinction of a rare is two hor rible for a nation to adopt, without entail ing upon itself the w rath of all Christendom, md engendering in the citizen a disregard tor human life and the rights of others w hich is d.uigerous to society, 1 see no substitute torstlch a S3 item except iu placing all the Indians on large reservations, and rapidly is it can be done, and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are fitted tor it they should be induced to take thei? lands in severally and to set up territorial t ioyernments for their own protection. For full details on this subject, 1 call your -pecial attention to the rejHirts of the Secre laryofthe Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The recouim 'tidation of the general of the irmy that appropriation be made for the torts at Boston. Portland. New York. Plula h lphia. New Orleans, and San Francisco.

Thti extent of country to be rarrisonej, and the numbers of inilitarv Mists to be occupied, is the same with m rJ. I need army as w ith a lart'ii one.

Editor Clarion: The time ha arrived when it becomes necessary to invoke the agency of a superior power to relieve us from the hand of the oppressor. Our ene mies are in the ascendant, and we can look lor nothing else than the tyranny that has been practiced upon other States that have been so unfortunate a lo be brought under Uadical d imiuion. Has not God reruiitted this for the res son that the people have forgotteu Him, and ran on in w ickedness unmindful of their obli gations to Him ? There can be no other good reason given. Had the people contin ued faithful to God as they were at the be aming of th war, we would to-dav have been a free people, blest with all tint we could desire. L'ufort unatel y. however, they became indifferent, and instead of success, disaster succeeded disaster until our armies became demoralized, and feeble; siirremlei was the consequence, and we became a prey liriiiii enemies. It is useless to point to he many eXimplcs Horded us in tne history of God' dealings w ith the recusant; these are potent to the mind of all who hav. tudied the word of GhI. That nation w ho was styled the "peculiar people" of God and wer under hi most vigilant watch. departed from Him, became idolatmu shared his displeasure and were cariied Into cMptivity. Our condition to-dav shows that He is the ' same G1 w ithout variation or -ha tow of turning.
