The nurse has J gone wherever summoned, whether the people nre able to pay or not. Three hundred and forty-six of the above calls wero charity, and there was a reduction in the price In some others. The number who have paid the regular price for the nurso'.s services Is a gratifying testi monial to the independent spirit of the people of the town, mid Indicates the large number whose need Is nursing at an ex pense within their means rather than free. The district nursing has brought la 4723 as compared to $'100 last year. Most of tho calls are made by tlio district nurse, but pupil nurses made 72 calls under the supervision of the district nurse. The recently organized Mutual ..id association has co-operated most helpfully with the district nursing. Bed linen and other articles have been loaned when needed and housekeepers have been provided in cases where they were more needed than a nurse, and also to supple ment the work of the nurse.

The score wns ,1fi to 23. mid after the first period the Hrattleboio quintet had n safe lend and had meii-ly to keep their end up. It wns a lively game to watch but not the real thing In basketball, as each mnlt played for himself for the most pnit and team woik of an effective kind was rare. J inutile" Doran completed bis con giess of nations by putting "Alec" CI Ion at centre. This alliance of live repre sentatives of lle of tile greatest na tions In the world looks good to't.io Brnt tleboro basketball enthusiasm and when tbe get used to each other they will make a team to give St. Jolinsbury a run for lis money later In tlio season.

Gion is n good man at centre and It Is good news that be will play here this season. Spiinglleld put In Gny against him in the llrst two periods and Church was bis opponent In the last round. Church tried a little rotighhousc. but Gion knew him of old and summnilly bustled him off the lloor. He al.o ef fectively blocked some of Church's grand stand piny, besides feeding up the ball to basket winners with coolness and precision. Stafford was strong In this wnv, snapping the ball to Damn for many of the winning shots. He also secured three baskets for himself. Doran was high man for the home tenm with 11 baskets to his credit. His eye for the basket was exceptionally good and he seldom missed a shot, when he bad tho ghost of n clianie Ijieasse. a newcomer In tills section, who plas with Ports mouth, made a good showing on long -hots, winning five baskets oft bard bailees. Doran played him closely but the stranger tools big chances and drop ped the ball In at unexpected moments. Ilogglo and McGulggan bad It out with neb other all the evening and kept each other so busy that they might both have been placd out in the hallway Just as well. McGulggan made a clever bas ket soon lifter the game started but neither seoied after that. I'he tlrst period opened ns though the score would lie small nut after a tew minutes Doran started things moving by lropping the ball in three times In rapid succession. Three more baskets by Do ran. Stafford ami Gion and two fouls shot by Martens raised the Itrattleboro score to 14 for the (list period while McGulg gan and Gay were the only ones to score ven single baskets for the visitors. The second petlnd was a continuation of tho fast individual woik. Brattleboro getting seven baskets to sprlnglleM s four, in the closing period the fast work told and the play was notlcabb slower. Spring- Held being one basket better -than the home team. Iteferee Hlley officiated acceptably and was light there with quicK decisions made possible by his own service on the lloor With the exception of the proti acted struggle between Hogglo and McGulggan. where he could have found fouls an time, be kept the play right up -to tin; scratch and. called fouls right and left.
