Merchants and manufacturers will find It worth while to consult the ln oome tax experts when making up their Inventories this year for there have been some 1,500 rulings as to the Interpretation of the tax law since Its enactment and notably among them has been one as to the pricing of Inventories on the mar ket or on the cost. Heretofore most merchants have preferred to inventory their goods at cost, prices as the market values wei*e advancing and they did not care to pay Income taxes on book profits before the goods had actually been sold. The government's rule there was If a taxpayer had elected to inven tory at cost prices he must keep on using cost aa the basis of his future inventories. Nowa new rule has been promul gated to the effect that a taxpayer may change to market values as the basis of his inventory but he will have to obtain consent to do so from the commissioner of internal revenue and he will have to continue to use market values thereafter until he ob tains oonsent TO change again. This and many other rulings of which the average merchant can know very little makes it highly prof itable to consult an income tax ex pert in making up returns. It is this complication the income tax law that makes It so annoying and ob noxious to the taxpayer. More money than it yields could be abstracted from the public by indirect taxation without anywhere near so muc]j ir ritation to those who pay the tax. SINGING AND SQN6S. Grandmother was born In 1800. Ehe had been a leading songster in the rural gatherings of her you,th and younger womanhood and he^ grand son wa« wont to cuddle up to grand mother and coax her to sing the old songs of her youth. So at grand mother's knee he listened to those old time songs as grandmother in her aged voice which still retained much of sweetness piped the quavers and semi-quavers of the early Nineteenth century. Among them were songs that had been handed down from they Revolu tion and the struggling oolonies, for grandmother was bora the year after Washington died and gi*and father In 1788. One of those old songs ran: —-Americana give ear America." 5 1 Of Britain's fading glory you prea entli shall hear. HI make a short digression, attend to what I say Concerning the taxation in North 'V Then of a later period was a song that related in det&ll and minor chords and notes the stor yof a young man named Bird, who had gone A. W. O. Ii. in the war of 1818 and had been shot as a deserter. Following that came to old campaign songs of Tippecanoe and Tyler too" and the Irmpooning In song of candidates for the presidency whose aspirations evidently did not appeal to the hill ft mm era of "York state" when grand mother took Interest In politics. Where grandmother left off other #ongs began. Half a century ago the "Wreck of the L«ady Elgin" was a popular song. Maybe some of you anelent recall "Lost on the Lady Elgin, Sunk to fee seen no moie, Numbered with that 800 that failed to reach the shore. And later on came "Silver Threads Among the Gold" to be followed by "Little Annie Rooney" at as till later period. And so on. Songs, the early songs, topk on a tinge of sadness or of moral and re ligious warning. Thus one anelent song of the forties related the ter rible death of a young woman who had gone "to parties, balls and route." and mayhap had "read novels" and suchlike stuff. That the song might lnclucate its lesson It was necessary to bring the young woman to her deathbed when as the relation went on: She called her father to her bed Her eyes were rolling in her head When I am dead remember well Your wicked daughter screams In hell." However, that song was rather uni que and not tn general use at social gatherings of a later date. But with all the minors and moan ings of the ancient days In some waya they seem preferable to "bungaloo," "room for two," "o-oo-o" stuff that slams against the ear drums of the period wi^h an aocomanlment of jazz and bass drums and clatter of any thing that will create an outrageous camor. And It is to be said of the old songs whatever else might be said, that they held nothing suggestive. They might be awful in muslo and in matter but they were clean. Music hath charms but its charm seems to vary greatly with the per loda and the generations. Spanish women are regarded as the world's beat dancers. 

TIMES- IMMIGRATION IS NOT ONE SI0E0. Some of the figures of recent im migration are suggestive. Among other things they suggest that a considerable part of the immigration of 1819 and of 1920 is of a kind readily assimilated and actually needed in this oountry. It further suggests that immigration should be strictly regulated Instead of totally denied. The country that sent the largest imlgratlon here in 1818 Is Canada. There was a reason. Wage and the opportunity attracted the Canadian. There Is something more to be con sidered in that reepect. The oppor tunity and (he wage tells a story of a short supply of labor here. And It Is to be noted that a majority of the Canadian Immigrants were classed as skilled labor. In fact of all the im migration of last year, all but about 90,000 were classed as skilled labor. And a skilled laborer is an asset to any country. Last August the figures show that 58,000 came in at Ellis Island while 37,000 went out Between January 1 and August of this year the net gain of immigrants over emigrants amounts to 85,008, figures that scarcely support the outcry that tne country la to be overrun with foreign Immlgranta. There is need in spots of a renewed labor supply. There has been scarcity of skilled labor. In th world trade war whloh is about to arrive the need of skilled labor will be more manifest aa regards do most io service It is dependent practically upon immigration. There Is a middle ground In Im migration as In all else whloh should be sought When ^thls depression passes, as it must soon, the demand upon American farms and Industries will be immense, at least the oppor tunity of American argiculture and Industry will be vaat.| The world.is to be rebuilt and the countries which can produce in quantity and claim a place in the world markets will prosper over others less prepared. Immigration should be closely scanned and the wheat separated form the tares but thrifty, hard working and ambitious men and women offer as much opportunity as they seek to the country that re ceives them. Topics of the Times American folks are not greatly in terested as to whether Constantino or someone else laking of Greece but they perk up their ears whan the suggestion is made that the United States should gWe orders on "European affairs and back up the orders with American soldiers and American money. The liberal people of this country will raise the sums aaked for by Herbert Hoover for the purpose they are asked. There's a vast difference between the charity that feeds starv ing children and the policy that would make the U. 8. a policeman for every frontier across the water. The worst of it is that bread mak ing at home may become a lost art Nobody is learning It. This another season wherein the homekeeplng Iowan can alt on the front porch and pity those who sought climate on the gulf coaat and the west coait If It were not for the mosquitoes and the flies this would be ideal summer weather, don't you think? If machinery will lure the boys back to the farm why not as an altruistic proposition make a string out on the price of farm implements? Ac lob that pays wages and brings descent living has changed from a perfunctory matter to a vital thing in the last few weeks. If you have one like that don't let anybody gfet It away from you. President Wllaon Is right In re fusing to aend delegates to discuss matters with the league. There will be Just so much less to undo If ho were to follow his usual method of selection of delegates. Mrs, MaeSwlney says the United Btatea failed. Strange Isn't it how much more a lady from Cork knows about us than we seem to understand about ourselves. The Junket acrosa to Paris should have been extremely enjoyable if the way It scattered public funds is a criticism of the pleasure the party got out of It. 

IOWIA OPINION AND NOTES. hTe Perry Chief saya, "the best things about the message which President Wilson aent to congress today was tho fact that It waa the last one he will send." The Des Moines Register says, "the president is old, broken and de feated. That baa been the lot of men before who have dared new ventures. The Nebel peace award will come to him with a hint of the judgment of the future. That judgment is infinite ly, more worth while' than any con temporaneous judgment" "Whafs tho moral difference in paying a political debt with an ap pointment to office or in paying it with caah," asks the Webster City Freeman Journal and makes answer to Its own query. '^Custom makes the' one respectable and the other a dis grace." The Wlaterloo Courier suggests, "a college of matrimony in which pros* pective brides and grooms would be made to understand prevlsely what the marriage relation implies and re quires to make it a auccesev would at least put ail parties to such a pact strictly on guard. Then If young people, obviously mlsmated, were bound to fly in the face of oertain after-troubla, they would have nd comeback on anybody. Perhaps the preachera could help In such an in stitution." "The legislature has a big task In connection with grade crossings. Iowa crossing laws now in force wore adopted loh^r before automobiles came ipto use," sayis the Des Moines Gapi- Iowa Newspapers TRY OUT THE 

BUSSES. [Des Moines Tribune.] If street car fare goes to 8 cents in Des Moines, some sort of com petition for the city's passenger tratilc Is inevitable. There is little doubt that thle competition will come in the form of bus lines, operating probably at a fare l^as than that charged by the city rhilway company. Busses have proved their worth in 1fJP|L0l,y "pn'seut larger cities than Des Moines, and k'm ,S there is no reason why Des Moines should not give the busses un oppor tunity to help care for the city's passenger business. A New York bus company carried 36,488,447 passengers in 279 busses during thfe year ending June 30, 1919, and cut down the running time be tween points from 20 to 50 per cent. Whero bus lines have failed, their failure has bee/i due chiefly to irre sponsible operation. Some munici palities have ruled that busses should keep off strata s*:hich li&ve a trolley franchise, j' It is to l»hoped that tbo city gov ernment will adopt an attitude toward the bus companies, if they should seek to entfer Des Moines, which will give them a fair trial. TIMES A STATE OP MIXIX (Sibley Trlbune.j Iowa is a long way from poverty and the bread line. It will buy enough southern California blue sky to keep the native sons in spending money this winter, even tho corn Is down. Times are not so bad aa the volume of spoken and printed words would signify. There is more real wealth in the coyntry—more thlpgs to eat and wear and to enjoy—than there were when we were blowing ourselves like drunken sailors a short time ago. There is as much real money as ever there was. Only credit has been curtailed. Credit is built on. faith in our fellows. We had too much of that faith a little while ago. Some of us had so much that we would swap perfectly good liberty bonds for wildcat stock on tho assurance of strangers in tight trousers that that was the way to divi dends and Easy street. Now we are undergoing a reaction. It is a stato of mind that alls us. We should come out of it Credit can only be restored by paying debts. We can't buy cheap and sell dear, much as we'd like to. Resumption of the business of buying and selling Is th« only way to bring back normal times BUT WILL GEORGE DO IT? [Mason City Globe Gazette.] Some people are experts at side stepping responsibility and duty. They simply "let George do it." Every thinking person knows that re lations between this country and Japan are not cordial. The Japanese* are highly incensed because we will not grant them racial and social equality. Some day, wheil they eatch us nap ping, they may want to fight Our great army is a thing of the past—a fleeting memory fast being forgotten. We have only a handful of men left "But we are not without means of defense," says the sidesteppers, "we will call up the American Legion." Exactly! Let George do it! Beoause he did his duty nobly and well In the. world war, there is no reason why the rest of us shouldn't sidestep our own duty and let George do it again. It is a beautiful scheme, and ap peals strongly to its advocates, but— Will George do it—again? Don't bet your money that he will, Esekiel. Not until the pikers and pacifists do will George do it, and then he'll take pleasure in taking a bayonet and see that they are kept at the front til they have done their share, mour? Does a tin Lizzie mean ease and wealth and absence of care? Has the farm reached the state of a 44 or 48 or 64 hour week? How far would you have to travel in the rural pre cincts to find soft i(vood floors and no carpets and dilapidated chairs and tables? The troubles of the farm are becoming numerous and serious and on the solution depends the bread and butter for many of us who are nqt engaged iiv farming. Let us take a brief survey of a few of these troubles. Perhaps the most serious is the in flated land values, what, inflated land values? Why talk such foolishness? Is not each aero of Iowa land worth J400, going, going at $450, who will give the five? Some mossback knocker, and old fogie is in opera tlon. Some solemn facts there are' A Request Wisely Refused. To the reasons given by Secretary Baker for refusing to bring biack from France an unidentified American sol dier for interring or enshrining in the Victory Hall to be built here in New York there can be no denial of ade quacy.

Th^ second and third mortgages the speculator's a Part ftnd panel °r gambling, leeching, barnacllng, how ever, with the giimo, a legitimate procedure. The fruits are the grief. These second and third mortgages will be paid, but it will take years and years of toil. Scmchody must work it out of the soil, sixteen hours I per duy, each day in the year. It would not be so bad If \tho titter* reaped, but their toil by which these mortgages are to be paid partly re bounds to the benefit of the fellow who toiled not, neither did he spin, it Is of such warp and woof that grangers, populists, nonpartisan leaguers, and bolsheviks are made, along the line of the ages. Inflated land values make inflated rents, grief number two. The renters must also toil to pay interest on sec ond and third mortgages and land values based on 37 cent dollars, more or less. This struggle is to go on. long and difficult. There is some good in all things erroneous. There will have to be better, far better, and more intensive farming.

Jean Valjean In Real Life. Victor Hugo's famous novel, "Les" Miserables," with Its story of the. re pentant convict, Jean Valjean, is re called ln Paris by the arrest of a cop persmith named Jules Renault, who has been discovered by the 'police after an interval of 35 years to :be an escaped convict 1 Renault when he was very young, committed an offense and was sen tenced to a term of deportation. He managed to escape' and,# coming to Paris, set up honestly in life as a coppersmith. He met a young girl with whom he fell in love, but, fear ing to disclose his criminal record, he was unable to marry her. As soon as he was arrested, Re nault asked permission from the Ju dicial authorities to'marry his sweet heart before starting for the penal settlements. This was granted, and accompanied by a couple of warders, he was able to leave hits prison for a brief marriage ceretriony. A movement is on foot to petition the' president. to* grant a free pardon to Renault on account of his sincere repentance as manifest by 30 years of honest citizenship.—London Mall.
