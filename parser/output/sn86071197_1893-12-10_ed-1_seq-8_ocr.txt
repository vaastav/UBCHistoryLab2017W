December 6 The fol lowing Is from Commissioner Holllngs worth commissioner of the department of agriculture statistics and history It has been one o7 fa > main efforts as commissioner of agriculture to collect In my department an exhibit of the various products of the Slate together with such Information as would be of use In exem plifying the agricultural and horticul tural posslbllltes of Texas While I readily Sdmlt the great valuo of our undeveloped resources and Uie importance of establish ing factories yet at the same time I nra forced to the conclusion thnt the wealth of Texas consists In Its Incompara ble agricultural and horticultural possi bilities pursuits to which our people are In all things adapted and the soil climate and season lend every aid I do not claim to hove completed my work so far as to give in tun thesa possibilities jet 1 think sufficient can be said to arouse on interest at homo and to bo exceedingly suggestive to all persona Investigating such questions in beginning I will assert that in no place does Experimenting with varlctlea and methods produce more startling re sults than In Texas Often a man falls nith a variety where later on anothor man by adopting a new method using the same variety makes a most signal suc cess When Mr H M Slrlngfcilovy con cluded to plant a pear orchard In Galves ton county and malic tho Le Conto pear his principal one his frirnds told him failed to who had tried that pear and beware of danger and great less Haying nothing to guide him In the Way of Other mens success and knowing what Ills friends told him was bo he concluded as a last resort Id plant tho pear orchard and rely on new mothoda tor results This jear hd hao marketed B127 bushels pf pcara off of thirteen acres and has paid out nearly 1100 per acre to his neighbors as wages for help nnd harvesting and tho ci op netted him 5t5 His new method was merely to fertllUo his land heavily using na much ns a ton per acre and his results a fortune to himself and descend ants I havo in my collection ono bushel Of thfso pears and they average 33 ounces each In weight aud will sell on account of excellence In any market In Oats I can present some wonderful facts tncy nro winter oats and have been grown by Mr John Harrison of Nash Kills county for twentytvo years As iwon as ho harvests his ont ho turns under the atubb His oats come up voluntarily arid he only row when he desires to change his field for oats The samples I have are the nfth crop from the bowing on which one hundred mules were pas tured all winter and yet it made over seventy bushel per acre His least crop 11s > is twentytwo yearn was sixty bushels to the acre and he has made as high as ninety bushels per acre I also have tha red oats taken out of a four hundred acre thit averaged over ona hundred patch and rwentyrive buaheW per acre Wheat of wnfch 1 have six varieties hows a Held ranging from 21 to bushels per acre This comprises both Bprlng nnd winter wheat and the samples are ex CCil eie t black are ie waxy lands in the North and Central por tions of the Htato and tha black sandy choeolato and red lands of the West and North As cotton is the principal crop or the black waxy lands but little experi ment on varieties and methods as to grain has been mode It Is looked upon by ail that a crop of grain Is certain and but tittle care Is given to the preparation of the aotl or the selection of the variety In tho West and Northwest nil credit for a crop Of grain IS given to the season and Variety ond methods play but a small part yet I have all kinds of grain per fectly grown and showing a large yield In all the States where the people on ac count of the density of the population and scarcity of land have been forced to adopt methods and select varieties with a view to get all possible from the soil the yield In groin has uniformly been doublsd from what It formerly was 1 think 1 can safely Jtay that every Indication points to similar results In this Htate Here I have oatu hat have made 12S bushels per acre Th man who grow them put In a little extra time in preparing tho soil HI neighbors made 75 bushels per acre hence this little extra time paid him 60 bushels of oats per acre Now let us add fertiliz ers and fl little more time nnd what thenT In Wheat I havo 48 bushels per acre against 25 for neighboring tnrms A little extra work in preparing the soil p ld S3 bushels of wheat per acre Now what can be added by varieties and rertUUersf In corn barley millet and rye the same results aro shown I am convinced that by experimenting on methods and a selection of the variety best miliod the yield of grain In this State can be made phenome nal and the grain crop of the West and Northwest made aa sure as the cotton crop on the black lands I have often advocated the diversifying of crops I know there ore portions of Texan that can make mora out of crops that can be successfully grown there than out of cotton I have soma line samples of tobacco from many places In Texas and It can be made a paying crop A Mr George Mayer In Dallas county is making i00 per acre on tobacco The Idea that tobacco grown hero IS not so strong and Well flavored ns that grown elsewhere la a mistake because when properly handled arid cured It has both strength and flavor Texas tobacco Is like all other kind31 It must go through ewoals and curloir pro cesses to bring out its qualities but Its qualities when brought out are porfoct and will sell anywhere Hi Hast Texas and along tho coast of Texas tobacco should
