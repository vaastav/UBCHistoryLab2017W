JV FLOURING MILL, The pople cf this town nIiouM, by all means, take some immediate action toward securing the flour hull which has been offered them this week. The enterprise is a bona &Ie business proposition offered by laoiness men and by no means ihoald the people of Condon allow ft to go elsewhere. The bonus ask ed is not largeonly enough to cov er the expense which is incident to moving the heavy machinery, etc, front th railroad to this place . and the benefits which would accrue to- the town and community from such sn enterprise will be many. Condon is now a good town but it should be abetter, larger more up-to-date town than it is and it can enly become so by those of us who are here going after every new pro ject within reach which is calculat ed to help build op the town, This a flouring mill will do. It will draw trade to every business man in the town and will injure no one. It will benefit the wheat growers and help the men who feed stock. It will build up without pulling down. The Lord helps those who help theraaelves" and if W6 will take hold and help secure the mill we may expect to see other enterprises and other improvements follow. Let us get the mill, get out of the rut, do something. The report being circulated to the effect that it has been muddy in Gilliam county this Winter is a canard. It is not mud at all. On ly wet dust Some republican papers which have opposed the ship subsidy bill take great comfort in the fact that President Roosevelt, in his mes sage did not specifically endorse that measure while some demo cratic papers which also oppose the subsidy graft take much com fort in the fact that he did not spe cifically condemn it. Strange, isn't it? While in Ohio last Fall Gover nor Geer whittled his name out in bi capital letters on the walls of the Temple of Fame by remarking that "the democrats are worse than the trusts." Now he tells Gover nor Van Sant that the trusts- railroad trusts arenot bad at all. That must take an awful load off the minds of the democratic breth ren. Perhaps after all they are not so black as our governor pain ted them while in Ohio. A Kansas editor insists that a "patched pair of pants often cover a warm heart." That editor needs a few more lessons in anatomy or some kindred study at his earliest possible convenience. Saw Death Near. "It often made my heart ache," write L. C.

A certain paper in Walla Walla peems to "be gaining more than its share of prestige and free adverti sing. Only a short time ago its editor got horse whipped by an irate female on the streets of that city and then last week the same paper "scooped" every newspaper in the United States by mis-reading a tel egram and thereby publishing the president's message a day before it was read in congress. The other papers up there should ask for an injunction restraining their compet itor from having any thing startling done to him or doing anything startling himself for at least 90 days A few more such breaks and he will be strictly "it."

The Salem Capital Journal of last Monday published official figures to show that by patting all fee into the state treasury th tax papers could be saved a boot $50,000 a year, A summary of the article shows that th Governor gets a constitutional salary of $1,500 a year, and M&rieaea boards and eommisiooa of $2,750. Annual appropriations the past year for his office $6,850. The Superin tendent of public Instruction gets a sal ary $2,500, and appropriations for his office, including clerical aid, amounts to $12,687.35 per annum. The state treas urer gets a salary of $5,311.87 and $2,900 a year for clerical services. It is gener ally understood that when there is a de mand for money he makes a great deal more than that by loaning idle state funds to banks and large firms. The secretary of state gets $2,850 in salaries, $14,643.01 in fee, and $8,983.55 a year from the legislature for clerical services in his office. He tarns over of the fees $4,134.55 and this leaves a net annual to tal for running bis office of $22,342.01 The appropriations for the state print er for four years including 1901-2 are $126,424.24, not including deficits to be made up by th next legislature, or $31, 806.06 per annum for printing and bind ing. A redaction in compensation of $25,000 a year could be made and still pay salaries larger than other states pay and at th asm time covnert $25,000 of fees into the state treasury, thus effect ing a change of $50,000 a year in favor of the taxpayer. As a new term of foor years begins after the next election the matter should be now discussed and the proper salary figures put into the state platforms. Says He Was Tortured.

Pullman Ordinary Sleepers The tourist travel between the East and the Facific Coast baa reached enor moos proportions in the last few years, and calls for a special class of equipment. To meet this demand the Pullman Co. has issued from its shops what It tech nlcally calls the "Pullman Ordinary Sleeper." These ears appear similar to the regular sleeper being bcilt on the same plan, bat not famished with the same elegance. They are equipped with mattresses, blanket!, sheets, pillows, pillow-cases, towels, combs, brashes, ect. , requiring nothing of the kind to be furnished by the passenger. Each car has a stove for making tea and coffee and doing "light housekeeping", and each section can befitted with an adjust able table. A uniformed porter accom panies each ear, bis business being to make op berths ; keep the car clean, and look after the wants and comforts of the passengers. In each of the trains which are dispatched daily from Portland by the O. B. A N. Co. Is to be foand one of these "Pullman Ordinary Sleepers". The car attached to the "Chicago-Portland Special" goes through to Cbicego without change, and the one in the "Atlantic Express" runs to Kansas City without change.
