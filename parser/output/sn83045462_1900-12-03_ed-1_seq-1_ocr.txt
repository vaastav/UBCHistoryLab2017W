STATE OF THE COUNTRY Condition of Affairs in China Discussed. THE PHILIPPINE PROBLEM How Far War Taxes May Be Reduced. OTH ER MATTERS TREATED OF The President today transmitted his an nual message to Congress. It was as fol lows: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: At the outgoing of the old and the in coming of the new century you begin the last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress with evidences on every hand of individual .,nd national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and increasing power for good of republican institutions. Your countrymen will join with you in felicita tion that American liberty Is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the determination to preserve it are more universal than at any former period of our history. 'Whe Republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly intrenched in the hearts of the people as now. The Constitu tion, with few amendments, exists as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have been made to it proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Popular government has demonstrated in its one hundred and twenty-four years of trial here its stability and security, and its effi c;ency as the best instrument of national development and the best safeguard to hu man rights. When the Sixth Congress assembled in November, 18W0, the population of the United States was 5,308,483. It is now 76,34,7?J9. Then we had sixteen states. Now we have forty-five. Then our territory gonsisted of 909.050 square miles. It is now 3,846,5 square miles. Education, religion, and morality have kept pace with our ad vancement in other directions, and while extending its power the Government has adhered to its foundation principles and abated none of them in dealing with our new peoples and possessions. A nation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and invokes His guidance and the continuance of His care and favor. THE 

CHLNESE PROBLEM. In our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of the Chi ngse problem. Apart from this our relations wvith the powers have been happy. The recent troubles in China spring from the anti foreign agitation which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese taces and in the traditions of their government. The Taiping rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade and settle *ntent disturbed alike the homogeneity and ..the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity made itself felt in all quarters, not alone on the coast, but along the great river arteries and in the remoter districts, carrying new ideas and introducing new associations among a rZimitive people which had pursued for centuries a national policy of isolation. The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamers plying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating year by year tar ther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types of an alien invasion, chang.ng the course of their national life and fraught with vague forebodings of disaster a to their beliefs and their self-control. For several years before the present trou bles all the resources of foreign diplomacy, backed by moral demonstrations of the physical force of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights of foreigners and to obtain satis faction from the respons.ible authorities for the sporadic outrages upon the persons and eun.perty of unoffending sojourners, which frum time to time occurred at widely sep arated points in the northern provinces, as in the case of the outbreaks in Sze-chuen arid Shani-tung. Posting of antiforeign placards became a daily occurrence, which the repeated reprobation of the imperial power failed to check or punish. These inflammatory np 'ptals to the ignorance and superstition of the masses, mendacious and absurd In their accusations and deeply hostile in their spirit,, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no particular ciiass of foreigners; they were impartial in at tacking everything foreign. An outbreak in Whan-tung, in which Ger man missionaries were slain, was the too natural result of these malevolent teach irgs. The posting of seditious placards, ex horting to the utter destruction of foreign ers and every foreign thing, continued un rebujed. Hostile demonstrations toward the stranger gained strength by organiza tion. The sect, commonly styled the Boxers, developed greatly in the provinces north of ' the Yang-Tae, and with the collusion og many notable officials, including some in the immediate councils of the Throne it self, became alarmingly aggressive. No foreigner's life, outside of the protected treaty ports, was safe. No foreign inter est was secure from spoliation. The diplomatic representatives of the pow *rs in Peking strove in vain to check tnIs piovement. Protest was followed by de sand and demand by renewed protest, to be :smet with perfunctory edicts from the Pal ace and evasive and futile assurances from the Taung-li-Yamen. Tire circle of the Box er influence narrowed about Peking, and while nominally stigmatised as seditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded the capital itself, that the Imperial forces were imbued ~with its doctrines, and that the immediate nsen=ots of the Emnress Dowager were in full sympathy with the anti-foreign movement. The Increasing gravity of the conditions in China and the Imminence of peril to our own diversified interests in the Empire. as well as to those of all the other treaty gov ernments, were soon appreciated by this government, causing it profound solic.tude. The United States from the earliest days of foreign intercourse with China had followed a policy of peace, omitting no occasions to testify good wil, to further the extens'on of lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of its government, and to insure by all le gitimate and kindly but earnest means the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of our law-abiding citizens and for the exercise of their beneficent call ings among the Chinese people. 

PROPOSALS TO THE POWERS. Mindful of this, it was felt to be appro priate that our purposes should be pro nounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of the powers at Pe k!ng to promote the administrative reforms so greatly needed for strengthenIng the Im perial Government and maintaining the in tegrity of China, In which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned. To these ends I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaIning spheres of influence In China the circular proposals of 1899, inviting from them declarations of their intentions and views as to the desirability of the adoption of measures insuring the benefits of equal ity of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy, enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations proof of the friendly spirit which animates the various powers Interested in the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the Chinese Empire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world. In this conclusion, which I had the gratifi cation to announce as a completed engage ment to the interested powers on March 20. 1900, I hopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policy of the Im perial Government, and for the effective exertion by it of power and akthority to quell the critical anti-foreign movement In the northern provinces most immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment. Seeking to testify confidence in the wil lingness and ability of the Imperial admin istration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we suffered and feared, the ma rine guard, which had been sent to Peking in the autumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at the earliest practicable moment, and all pending ques ticns were remitted, as far as we were con cerned, to the ordinary resorts of diplomatic intercourse. The Chinese Government proved, however, unable to check the rising strength of the Bexers and appeared to be a prey to inter nal dissensions. In the unequal contest the anti-foreign influences soon gained the as cendancy under the leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of Boxers, with which the Imperial forces affiliated, held the country between Peking and the coast. penetrated into Manchuria up to the Rus sian borders, and through their emissaries threatened a like rising Throughout north ern China. Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property. and slaughter of native con verts were reported from all sides. The Tsung-li-Yamen, already permeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective response to the appeals of the legations. At this critical juncture, in the early spring of this year, a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleet should be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration, under cover of which to ex act of the Chinese Government respect for foreign treaty rights and the suppres sion of the Boxers. The United States, while not participating in the joint demonstration, promptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for service on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at Taku and sent to Peking for the protection of the American legation. Other powers took sim ilar action, until some four hundred men were assembled in the capital as legation guards. Still the peril increased. The legations re ported the development of the seditious movement in Peking and the need of in creased provision for defense against it. While preparations were in progress for a larger expedition, to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open, an at tempt of the foreign ships to make a land ing at Taku was met by a fire from the Chinese fort.. The forts were thereupon shelled by the foreign vessels, the American admiral taking no part in the attack, on the ground that we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration might con solidate the an'iforelgn elements and strengthen the Boxers to oppose the reliev ing column. Two days later the Taku forts were cap tured after a sanguinary conflict. Sever ance of communication with Peking fol lowed, and a combined force of additional guards. wh.ch was advancing to Peking by the Pel-Ho, was checked at Langfang. The isolation of the legations was complete. The siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying history. In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted baind, clinging to hope in the face of despair, and the undaunted spirit that led their relievers through battle and suffering to the goal, it is a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag was maintained alike in the siege and the rescue, and tha,t stout American hearts have again set high, in fervent emulation with true men of other race and language, the indomitable, courage that ever strives for the cause of right and justice. THE LEGATIONS CUT OFF. By June 19th the legations were cut off. An identical Dote from the Yamen ordered each minister to leave Peking, under a promised escort, within twenty-four hours. To gain time they replied, asking prolonga tion of the time, which 'was after wards granted, and requesting an in terview with the Taung-li-Yamen on the followIng day. No reply being received, on the morning of the 20th the German minister, Baron von Ketteler, set out for the Yamen to obtain a response, and on the way was murdered. An attempt by the legation guard to re cover his body was foiled by the Chinese. Armed forces turned out against the lega tions. Their quarters were surrounded and attacked. The mission compounds were abandoned, their Inmates taking refuge in the British legation, where all the other legations and guards gathered for more effective defense. Four hundred persons were crowded In Its narrow compass. Two thousand native converts zwere assembled in a near-by palace under protection of the foreigners. Lines of defejise were strength ened, trenches dug, barricades raised and SHAN SI BUTCHERIES Details of the Atrocities of the Chinese Governor. FOULLY IURDERED HIS GUESTS Promised Them Safety and Then Treacherously Stabbed Them. HE WILL GET THE SILK CORD BERLIN, December 3.-A special dispatch from China to the Volks Zeitung reports a fearful mission slaughter in the province of Shan St. The first victims, the dispatch says, were a Catholic bishop and his coad jutors and four European priests, Francis cans, Italian and French. The governor invited them to his house, pretending to give them better protection; but when they arrived their hands were tied. Then the governor himself poinarded them all. Next the governor went to the bishop's residence with a number of sol diers and seized six Marseilles Sisters. He promised them money and distinguished husbands if .hey would renounce Christian ity, which offer they unanimously rejected. Thereupon the governor poinarded them and also a number of Chinese priests and thirty Chinese sisters and 200 orphans from three to sixteen years of age. Fifteen seminarists, who had hidden themselves in a cistern, were, the dispatch says, tied to stakes and forced to drink the blood of the first victims.. They were then killed. A Chinese priest and two Christians who attempted to escape were caught and put in a small hut, where they were burned. GERMAN TROOPS IN DANGER. Eight Companies of French Soldiers Go to Their Aid. TIEN TSIN, December 2.-Four compa nies of German troops are reported to be seriously menaced thirty-five miles west of Pao Ting Fu. Eight companies of Frenen troops, with three days' rations, have left to go to their relief.

BOLOMEN SWEAR ALLEGIANCE. Twenty-Two Hundred Natives Take the Oath at Vigan. MANILA, December 3.-Sunday In Vi gan was a great day for the American cause. Twenty-two hundred natives of the region, nearly all fighting rebels, crowded the church and took the oath of allegiance to the United States. The oath was ad ministered by the priest. All but 500 of those sworn were bolomen. The number in cluded the 1,200 bolomen who had pre viously surrendered. The proceedings at the church occupied the entire day, and included an address by General Young and an exhortat'on by the priest. Scarcely any rebels remain in the vicinity of Santa Maria. General Young attributes this fact to three causes--the election of President McKinley, the ar rival of a stTonger body of troops and the especially r:gid enforcement or the war measures and the deportation of prisoners t, Manila. He reports that it :s necessary to occupy all the barriers in order to protect the natives from vengeance of Tagalog raiders.

TE PEIDWT'S CAIES TODAY Kentuckians Pushing Yerkes for Internal Revenue Commissioner. MANLEY MAY DECLINE The President's message which went to Congress today contains about 18,000 words. This is about 4,000 words less than a year ago and about the same length as in 1S98. The message is not delivered to Congress in printed form. It has always been cus tomary to deliver it to the presiding officers of the Senate and House in manuscript. This was done today. The task of putting two copies in neat, legible manuscript after the message has been put in type is not a small undertaking. Two of the best pen men at the White House do the work. As sistant Secretaty Pruden is one of these, and he has an assistant. The copy pre sented to the Senate today contained 222 pages of manuscript, as clear as print and without blur or blemish. It was practically decided on Saturday that the message would not go to Congress until Tuesday, as it was expected Congress would adjourn today immediately on as sembling as a token of respect to the memo ries of the late Senators Davis and Gear. It was found Saturday n:ght that Senator Nelson, the colleague of the late Senator Davis, would not be here today to make the motion for adjournment. Therefore It was decided to send in the message today. Congress will take action respecting the dead senators later. The President did the last work on the message on Friday night, and the public printer, w'.th minor corrections to be made, had the document in type Saturday morn ing. The Congressional Committee. The committee to inform the President that Congress was in session and ready to receive any communication from him reached the White House at 1:20 o'clock, and was ushered into the President's office. The committeo consisted of Senators Hoar and Cockrell, Representatives Payne, Gros venor and Richardson. The President said he was g!ad Congress was again in session. Immediately after the committee had gone from the White House Assistant Secretary Pruden, accompanied by Executive Clerk Young, left for the Capitol with the mes sage. The President's Callers. Before Congress met this morning the President had numerous callers, most of them congressmen who desired to pay their respects. The number included Sena tors Kean, Deboe and McMillin, Represen tatives Henry of Connecticut, Grosvenor, Lacey, Boreing, Bingham and Pearce. A. L. Harris, ex-lieutenant governor of Ohio, and a member of the industrial com mission wg also a caller. Mr. Harris says that e mhiitrial -commission will not make its full report to Congress for a year. It will not make a partial report of any kind prior to that time unless Congress asks for it Yerkes Favorably Regarded. Senator Deboe and Representative Bore Ing talked to the President about the com missionership of internal revenue. It is understood that if Joseph Manley does not accept the appointment the Kentucky peo ple will be able to land the position for John W. Yerkes of that state. The Ken tucklans feel that the appointment of Mr. Yerkes would mean much to them in a po litical way. There is still doubt whether Mr. Manley will accept the offer made to him Representative Lacey's Ditrict. Representative Lacey has what is called a close district in Iowa. President McKin ley has campaigned in the district, and knows something of it. So he always asks about the majority Mr. Lacey gets. "My district is invariably mighty close, according to all authorities, until the day of the election. Then the boys hump them selves and turn out a safe republican ma jority. It's funny, though, about the demo crats. They have a dream before each elec tion that they will win, and they bet their ) money freely. The consequence is they practically pay the election expenses of the republicans." Special Message on the Canal. The President, it is understood, will send a special message to Congress on the sub ject of the Nicaragua canal. He has be fore him the report of the canal commission and is going over it carefully. He will send it to Congress along with his own views. 

HALL OF RECORDS SITE. rhree Bill. Providing for It. Purchase Pending in the Senate. Three bills for the purchase of a site for a hall of records are pending in the Senate, and they are likely to receive the attention of the committee on public buildings and grounds at an early day. Senator Fair banks, chairman of that committee, has bad several conferences with members of the cabinet in relation to a site for a hall of records, and- he is strongly in favor of having action taken in this matter during the coming session. The three bills proposing sites for a hall of records were introduced by Senators Fairbanks, Teller and Elkins. Senator Fair banks' bill authorize. the purchase of the site located on the southeast corner of Pennsylvania avenue and 15th street, which is now occupied by the Hotel Regent. This mite has a frontage of 174 feet on Pennsyl vania avenue and 150 feet on 15th street. The price to be paid for the mite is fixed at not more than $400,000. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorised to acquire this lot, either by purchase or through condem nation Droceedings. Senator Teller's bill, introduced by re quest, authorizes the acquisition of square 220 in this city, which contains 42,617 square feet of ground, for which $275,000 is appro priated. The above square is bounded on the north by Ohio aveniue, on the east by 14th street, on the south by C street and on the west by 15th street and the White Lot. Besides the smaller buildings on this square is the Cyclorama building and an nex, containing over 690,000 cubic feet of space, suitable for the immediate storage of government records. The bill introduced by Mr. Elkins by re quest appropriates $243,000 for the pur chase of a site b-unded on the north by G street, on the east by 17th street, on the south by the Winder building propeuiy and on the west by an alley, and contain lng 30,478 square feet of ground. For the pups fpeaigfor immediate use the bldnsothssite $10,000 is approprt ated. This property, it Is provided in the snay be acquired either by purobase or anproceedings. . MN, 3a3Ce~CK'S PROMOiON. represented since Governor-elect LaFollette was in Congress. Speaker Henderson's as s-rgnment of Mr. Babcock is therefore a tribute to Wisconsin as well as an honor to one of Wisconsin's favorite sons. Mr. Babcock resigns his membership of the committee on insular affairs, an important position in itself, to accept what is regarded by representatives in Congress as a de served promotion. The appointment is further recognition of Mr. Babcock's prominence in national af fairs. Soon after he came to Congrrss hs vigorous personality brought him into na tional view, the first evidence being his selection as chairman of the republican congressional campaign committee. As the successful general of four victorious cam pa-gns he has demonstrated that the conti dence of h's colleagues was not misplaced when reposed in him. His long and conspicuous connection with the larger interests of his party logically put him in line for duty on this important committee. His training and experience have been essentially those of the business man, and he is regarded by his colleagues as thoroughly equipped to render good ser vice on a committee which deals altogether with the business and industrial interests of the country. He will retain his chair manship of the District committee. THE CLAIM AGAINST TURKEY. It is Believed That There i Now a Prospect of Payment. The officials of the State Department de cline to make any statement whatever for publication relative to the announcement from Constantinople that the Turkish gov ernment had arranged to pay the American mission claims under cover of a contract for a warship with the Cramps. Neverthe less there is reason to believe that the re port is well founded, and the claims are now in a fair way to be paid. It is the ex pectation that the Cramps, instead of un dertaking to deal directly with the claim ants, will simply turn over to the State Department the amount of the claims, in the neighborhood of E23,000, and that the department will disburse the money to the claimants. WhIle in this way there will be no direct dealing between the United States and Turkish governments, the end in view. namely, the collection of the money, will be effected. It is said in administration circles that there is no disposition to be captious as to the form taken for the pay ment. The settlement of this matter will permit the battle ship Kentucky to proceed on her way to Manila or to return over her route far enough to pick up the American consul general at Tangiers and assist him morally In the collection of the indemnity demanded in the Ezzegul case. The State Department prefers the use of an imposing craft Ilke the Kentucky rather than a cruiser, but if the former cannot complete her original mission in season then recourse can be had to the Dixie in the Moorish case. . * MR. CONGER'S NEGOTIATIONS. Trying to Effect a Modidcation of the Envoys' Agreement.

Meanwhile it is said that, following. his latest instructions to confer. 3vith the British and German ministers at Pekin, he is making substan tial headway toward the substitution of a modified agreement on the lines of the poli cies laid down in the State Department's vadlous propositions to the powers. While the United Btates government has not seen fit to make any forwAl protest &gainst the continuance of the punitive ex peditions being sent out from Pekin from time to time, it has managed to convey to the powers its belief that the further pros acution of this policy is indiscreet, and will tend to greatly delay the return of the Chinese authorities to Pekin, and the final settlement toward which all efforts are now cirected. It is believed that these intima tiorls have been taken in good part by the various foreign offices, and that a restrain ing Influence will soon be exerted upon the military officers In China.
