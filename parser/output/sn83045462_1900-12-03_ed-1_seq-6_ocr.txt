A Buinens-Like Report. Once more President McKinley has ad dressed to Congress an annual message t hich is chiefly to be characterized as bust ness-like. It is a report rather than a politi cal essay, a record rather than the pro ,ouncement of personal views. It deals with the affairs of the republic in a straightforward manner with a minimum of flourish, and in consequence it will be read understandingly by all the people. It is by no means a detraction to declare that it is devoid of news. There is scarcu'y a single item in the entire message-the an nouncement of the American international arbitrators being a conspicuous exception to the rule-which is not already known to the average reader of the newspapers. Thws is revealed once more the policy of this ad ministrati an to %eep the people fully posted as to the affairs of the government. Fully one-half of the message relates to forelgn relations, and one-half of this por tion concerns the Chinese crisis. This pro portion suggests anew the increased part which the United States is now taking in world affairs. Our foreign relations are re ported as generally in a most satisfactory ,ondition. The friction with Turkey in treated delicate!y and briefly, and a hope is expressed that it will be speedily re moved. No mention is made of the refusal oif the sultan to issue an exequatur to our consul at larpoot, perhaps in deference to the present strain in the case. It is gratifying to note that the Presi dent declares that the temporary boundary agreement in Alaska is "at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should not he suffered to delay the speedy and com plete establishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the Russo American treaty for the cession of Alaska." This vigorous declaration should lead to renewed negotiations and a satisfactory set tlement of the boundary dispute at an early late. The President renews his recommenda tions that the federal courts be given jur isdiction over crimes in which the interna tional relations of the government are in volved, such as the lynching of Italians by A. Louisiana mob. He takes occasion in this -onnection to renew his strong views re :arling the lynching evil, which he char .tCterizes as a "reproach upon our civiliza lion." The subject of the interoceanic canal is Irief'y but urgently presented, with the recommendation that the Senate ratify the pending treaty with England on this sub ject. The President urges action upon the recl procity conventions and sounds a note of warning that if other governments persist in tak!ng steps to the detriment of Ameri can trade he will outline a course of legis lation to meet the emergency. The finances ,.f the country are reported as in exeellent condition, with a surplus for the past year of nearly 5(MA00 and a pr!spective surplus f,r the current year of an equal amount. The President believes that it will be ihe duty as well as the dis 1ositon of Congress "to provide whatever further legislati,n Is needed to insure the (-ntinued parity under all conditlonls be tweetn our two forms of metallic money. silver and goidt' The trade statistics call forth enthusiasti, expressions of oleasure from the executive, as significant of the widespriad prosperity of the peoile. The President recommends a reduction of, the war revenue taxes by 5.o,000, "by the remission of those taxes which ex perience has shown to be the most burden some to the industries of the people," and he specially urges that such reduction shall include the legacy tax bequests for public uses of a literary, charitable or educational character. The shipping subsi,ly measure receives a word of warm commendation. The Presi dent's expressions on the trust question are in repetition of those he uttered In his message of 1899;, anti he concludes the para gt'ph with the statement that "restraint upon such c'mbiations as are injurious, and which are within federal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the Con 6,ress." Army reorganization calls forth the rec ommendation that legislation be had to meet the impending emergency, and the President regers a pproving:y to Secretary Root's proposals, basing his words on the need of an army of about (10.000 men in the P'hilippines for the immediate future. Amon;; miscellaneous items the President urges the early construction of a Pacific cable and the enactment of legislation to correct faults in the alien contract law. HeI :ndorses Secretary Long's recommendations for naval increases and formally recom mends that the Congress. "at its present session," apportion representation among the several states as provided by the Con stitution. This recommendation follows a review of the census work, which cites Di rector Merriamts suggestion that a perma nent force of experts be maintained, The general summary of governmental affairs discloses a satisfactory administra tive condition. The President closes with an eloquent paragraph which cautions Con gress against being led by the prevailing prosperity into extravagance in. appropria tions. This is the most striking feature of the entire message. Personally the kaiser may have no objec tions to Oom Paul. But he wIll rua no risks of letting the doughty Boer drag him nto a family quarrel. Washington and London. With the American Congress and the BSritish parliament opening on the same 'iay there ought not to be any dearth of political news for some tIme to come. The attention of the whole world, indeed, will ibe more or less directed to the two bodies while they remain in session, Each has business of importance to transact. Each represents, though in net exactly the same degree, a recent expression of the popular will, and with reference to matters of world-wide interest, and each, therefore, in the measures passed, will, at. the very least, provide something worthy of discus sIon and certain to provoke discussion. The parliament is the one just elected. It starts off with the problems upon which the appeal to the people -.wa- made, and with a mandate which is unmistakable. Lord flalisbury's triunmph at the ' po~lls was ex tr'aordinary. The people heard him as to what he had done, and also as to what in bis opinion remsad to be done, and they have given him p majotity large enough to mustain him in the accomplishment of his purposes. Hei las definite 'ends'in view th with regard to0 the reorganization of the army and the' strengthening pif the whole empire, and if his proganm is sue esful Great Britji..wiM~ be -'asonger on land and sea than. eter before in her long and famous historer.: T?hs of isd, will lavest every move that he now ma1.ue with a desat= thea til extent af whisk mm behoove all the nations fully and correctly to fathom. The Congress, on the other hand, is an expiring body. Its commission was re ceived two years ago. And yet in much that it does it will reflect the verdict of last month. Its performances were indorsed as were those of the national administra tion, and in closing up its business that fact should be and will be borne in mind. Measures outside of the routine are press ing for attention, and some of them are likely to receive it. So that there will probably be a forecast given this winter of what the recent victory at the polls will fully show when the Congress elected ex pressly to interpret it organizes and be gins work. We too have a question of army reorganization to deal with, but only with the view of efficiently handling complica tions in our new possessions, and with no thought of putting ourselves on a basis of progressive militarism, or of impressing the world with a show of guns and men. We are not menaced in any quarter, and em pire is no sane American's dream or wish. The Washington and the London date lines will for the present, therefore, have the right of way in the newspapers. The news they carry will be worth reading. It will explain not only what is going on at the two capitals, but much of what Is go ing on elsewhere. - 0 The Commissioners' Report. The Cof'nmissioners' annual report, sub mitted today, shows a prosperous, progres sive District, with certain requirements to be met Ir order to justify its rank as the national capital and to provide for the 'growing wants of a modern community. The standing needs are strongly reiterated, such as additions to the police and fire de partment, more public schools, legislation for the burial of wires and the construction of conduits and the formal extension of the civil service jaw to the municipal govern ment. Particular attention is directed toward others, which, while of long stand ing, are worthy of special consideration. These include the municipal building, the completion of the sewerage plans, and the enlargement and filtration of the water sup ply. The Commissioners place these pro jects together with reference to the finan cial questions Involved, and urge that pro vision be made for their execution by means of a draft upon the revenues of the future. In other words, the Commissioners favor the adoption of the principle of bonding the District, either to private creditors or to the federal government, to permit the pres ent construction of works which will bene fit the Washington of the future, paying the District's share of the cost of these bet terments from the funds to be derived in later years from local taxes. This is the most important recommenda tion in the entire report. It is briefly stated, but none the less forcefully. It will proba bly precipitate a discussion of the best method of executing these large public works. Experience with 'annual appropria tions, subject to the whims of committees and the fluctuations of policies, shows that the most satisfactory method of obtaining results, particularly In large enterprises, is to secure the funds at once and to pay them back year by year as the revenues accumu late. The Commissioners offer an alterna tive proposition for the goverhment to ad vance a sufficient sum to meet the District's share of the cost, or for the District - to rmise its portion by a bond issue. The former method has already been adopted in certain instances of large public improve men ts. There should he no demur at this propost tion. The works projected are essential to the preservation of the public health. The prinelple underlying the organic act is strictly ob.erved. There is no denial of the r.eed. and the on!y question arises as to the moile of payment. Every consideration of husiness 'prudenve suggests the adoption of one or the other of the Commissioners' suggestions. The Commfssioners set forth the need of the improvement of the Anacostia river in strong language, basing, however, their recommendalion of improvement upon the correct assumption that this enterprise lies wholly within the jurisdiction of the fed eral government. China in the Message. The Pr,esident's treatment of the Chinese crisis in his message affords a most Inter est ling aid comprehensive review of that affair. The immediate points of interest in this chapt-r of the message are the Presi ient's declaration that the foreign war -hl.is fired upon the Taku forts only after they were at'acked from the forts when they sought to land a force; that the Chi n-se government fostered the Boxer move mont; tha,t that government participated in the assault -ipon the legations, that it did not succor the legations with contributions of food, beyond the merest trifles, and final ly that the ne:totiations are now in fair way to succeed in re-establishing peace with a responsie Chinese government, with 'the open door of trade maintained. There is hut little discussion of the inter na:i'inal negotiations with re'ference to the process of treating with China, It is to be pre'sumed thact the President will, either voluintarily or upon a request from Con gress, later submit the entire correspondence in this case, sheuld there be no diplomatic reasons ...gainst full publicity. There are szne interesting features of the affair yet to be fully disclosed, and an official pre sen,tation of such matters as the orginal German proposals, the final Anglo-German agreement and the recently formulated de mands of the allies remains to be made. It suffices for the present, however, that the President indicates his hope of "a comn Ihiete settletmert of all questions involved, assuring foreign rights of residence and in tercourse on terms of equality for all the world." The President concurs in the Russian suggestion that the indemnity question be relegated to the arbitration court at The Hague. He turther notes that he haa ac cepted, as in full consonance with our own desires, the Ru.ssian proposition looking to the restoration of the imperial power in Pekin. for, without foregoing a jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and de terrent punishment of the chief criminals, effective reparation can best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences and obeys. This is the keynote of the American policy with re gard to China and all that the President states in his message is consistent wi(h it. A Chicago physic'.an advances the theory that men over thirty-five years of age do not need exercise. It is not likely that it will be generally accepted. It deprives too many golf players of their best excuse.' The polHticians of all shades of opinion are now waiting to see whether this Con gress will develop anything which can be made to do duty as a campaign issue. The President on the Philippine.e The Philippines form one of the important topics treated by the President in his an nual message. But there are no 'atrikIhg~ recommendations and no novel disclosures concerning the archipelago. - 'he President expresses general satisfaction with tihe con-. dition of affairs in the islandas and points to. the work of the Taft, coopmls=ion in' terms of pleasure and reassuranoe. He de clares that opposition to the American soy ereignty has passed beyond tleo stage of or ganisation, and that "what opDositibxn 4. malns is for the most part a tered. obey ing no' concerted plan: of strategic action, operating only by the methodi common to the traditions of guerrilla warfa.re? While these operations ge insuflicientg W,ltet general control now --t-hlii-sdthey beget inscurtty -among the poseful'~siggetiean a.nd aeete eomams...ena tam- as Ib. benefits of local self-government, educa tion and Industrial and agricultural devel opment which this government stands ready to give to the Filipinos. The President recites his instructions to the Taft commission and the features of its preliminary report of August 21. He states that later reports show a yet more encour aging advance toward extending the bene fits of liberty and good government to the natives "in the Interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring, self-supporting and self-administering com munity." These phrases Indicate the nature of the President's Philippines policy. There Is nothing In it of "imperialism," nothing suggeitive of a denial of liberty. He spe cifically impresses upon Congress 'hat what ever legislation may be enacted should be along these generous lines. He bespeaks kindly treatment for the Filipinos, whom he styles "a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge." This feature of the message Is calculated to further the work of establishing unques tioned American sovereignty. It -P'peals to the good sense and the higher instincts of the Filipinos. It assures them of kindly treatment and progressive benefits. It ought to be a most effective adjunct to the peaceful processes of the Taft commission and the harsher arguments of General Mac Arthur's forces. Its temperate words, If fairly read by the native leaders, must make of tnem missionaries for the accept ance of a sovereignty which promises noth ing but advancement for the individual freedom from oppression, enjoyment of wide personal and collective liberty and access to the latest methods of industry and education. The American Arbitrators. The only real news item in the President's message is his announcement of the ap pointment of Benjamin Harrison, Melville W. Fuller, John W. Griggs and George Gray as the American members of the In ternational Arbitration Bureau. The selec tions are exceptionally happy. All are dis tinguished'in the law. One is at the head of this country's highest court and another sits o: anImpo-tant bench. One was once President of the United States and is now one of the foremost counsellors In Interna tional affairs.. One is jus. concluding a most satisfact6ry term as Attorney General of the United States. Indeed, the combina tion Is beyond criticism. Politically an evcn division theoretically exists, two members being republicans and two democrats. al though. politics should have and doubtless has had no Influence in the selections. Geo graphically there Is a curious coincidence, two of the members coming from adjacent eastern states and two from adjacent mid dle western states. It Is assured that the American members of this high court of arbitration will fully represent and main tain the American principles of honor and justice and preserve the world prestige of the republic. 000 'The President and the Centennial. President McKinley has entered into the plane for the celebration of the capital cen tennial with heartening approval and en couragement. His aid and advice have been freely at the disposal of the committees in charge and It greatly helped In the perfec tion of the program that he has at all times been sympathetic and appreciative of the importance of the occasion. This spirit Is reflected in his comments upon the affair in his annual message, which indicate the national Importance of the event. As he says, "the transfer of the government to this city is a fact of great historical Inter est" and the President Is in a position to know whereof he speaks when he says that "among the people there is a feeling of genuine pride in the capital of the repub lic." The formal statement of the program indicates how fully this approaching cele bration has appealed to the interest of the government and the people of the states. The Duke of Manchester surprised his friends in society by gracefully doing a cake walk. This will be good news to the people who feared that the young man had all these years been leading a life devoid of ambiti.n. 4 10 The divekeepers have put up their shut ters in New York, but have not moved out. They evidently regard this reform move ment as a mere temporary hindrance to business, something like a blizzard. It is a relief to turn from the threats of Imperialism and commercial despotism to Secretary Wilson's mild warning that the country Is In some danger of being over run by Belgian hares. Mr. Bryan refrains from giving any pre liminary advice to Congress, but it is ex pected that he will be on hand when events open the avenues to criticism. It is scarcely to be hoped that we will get from now w the 2d of next January without a few more wrangles over that beginning of the century question. Everything is placId in the mining dis tricts, and all the operators have to do Is to walt for the next cold wave and reap their reward. 

SHOOTING STARS. A Reaiist. "So you let your leading man go?" "I had to," answered Mr. Stormington Barnes. "He was too realistic in his Ideas." "Interfered with your work on the stage?" "No, not on the stage. In the box of fice. He wanted real money." Contrast. The public's strange ways often sadly amaze The man who to Congress has gone. It will throw you bouquets in the earlier days, And, alas! throw you down later on. In the Harness. "I suppose you will be glad to get in the harness again?" said the friend. "I wish you wouldn't use that phrase," answei'ed the sensitive member of Con gress. "It sounds too much as If I were depending on a pulL" An Apprehensive Person. "What Is the difficulty about digging the isthmian waterway ?" "Well," answered the man who places a very low estImate on his fellow-mortal, "I shouldn't be a bit surprised If the matter of pecunIary consideration intruded Itself.
