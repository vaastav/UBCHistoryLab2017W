VOLUME 119. GENERAL SIR CHARLES WARREN. Ha Has Arrived at Gape Town and Gees to Port Elizabeth. No Farther News of Battle et Tugela River. Mafeking Safe on the 16th and Colonel Baden-Powell Pushing Out His Defenses—Other Be leaguered Garrisons and Posi tions Still Holding Out—Baron Roberts of Kandahar Sent to South Africa as Commander-in- Chief. LONDON, Dec. 18.—(4:43 a. m.)— Lieutenant General Sir Charles War ren, commanding the Fifth Division of the First Army Corps, has arrived at Cape Town- It is understood that he will proceed to Port Elizabeth. No further news has been received regarding the battle at the Tugela River. The latest accounts regarding the battle at Magersfontein show that the retirement of the British troops was executed with the greatest coolness and order under a heavy Boer artillery fire on Tuesday. Mafeking was safe on December 10th, and Colonel Baden- Powell, the British commander there, is still actively pushing out his de fenses. At that time the Boers had offered to exchange Lady Sarah Wils on, who was captured while acting as a correspondent for the London "Daily Mail," for General Ben Viljoen, who was captured at Elands Laagte, but the offer had been declined. The other beleaguered garrisons and positions are still holding out. It is said that if the Victoria cross were to be granted for every act of conspicuous gallantry on the part of the British troops, it would be neces sary to distribute the decoration by hundreds. WILL REMAIN AT WINDSOR. The Queen Will Not Spend Christ mas at Osborne House. LONDON, Dec. 17. — The "Court News" has issued the following an nouncement: "The arrangements made for the Queen's departure from Windsor have been postponed until after Christmas as, owing to the present state of af fairs in South Africa, the Queen is un willing to be at a great distance from London. Not for years before has the Queen decided to spend Christmas away from Osborne. Her decision to remain at Windsor in touch with the Cabinet shows in a measure the gravity of the crisis and of the anxiety her majesty feels for the welfare of the country. She is, nevertheless, in fair health. Sat urday morning she took her usual drive, and just before dinner that ev ening she received Lord Wolseley. who, with Major General Sir Henry Peter Ewart, crown equerry to the Queen, dined at Windsor. "Black week" as last week is now called, has evidently aroused the Gov ernment and the W r ar Office to a full sense of their responsibility and of the magnitude of the task before them. The papers unanimously applaud this awak ening, despite the fact that they recog nize that the heroic measures now de cided upon savor rather of weakness than of strength. Rumor has it that the question of expense has really been at the bottom of the half hearted measures hitherto adopted, and it is not unlikely that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and other members of the Cabinet, will resign. It is high time that something very energetic was done. The British lof-ses in killed, wounded, prisoners and miss ing throughout the campaign now reach the enormous total of 7,030. The tragic circumstances of the ap pointment of Lord Roberts almost si multaneously with the announcement of the death of his promising son excite the deepest public sympathy. Lieutenant Roberts was an only son and had been his father's aide-de-camp since 18M">. He served in Waziristan and in the Chitral and Nile expeditions. Such was his display of gallantry Friday in an attempt to rescue the guns that he was recommended for the Vic toria cross. 

ENGLAND NOT FIGHTING Merely for Supremacy, but for Her Position as a Great Power. LONDON, Dec. 18.—The "Times," commenting on the situation, says: "Neither the Crimean war nor the Indian mutiny gave rise to greater dangers to the empire than that with which we are now menaced, nor at either of those critical periods was Great Britain so isolated politically or regarded with such dislike and sus picion as are now almost everywhere apparent. Unless the calmness which impresses the foreign observer proceeds only from apathy or a want of suffi cient imagination to realize the immi nent danger to the whole fabric of our empire, the great efforts now urgently required will surely be made before it is too late to retrieve the situation. We are fighting not only merely for su premacy in South Africa, but our posi tion as a great power. W r e know we have miscalculated the strength of our foe, and we are resolved to mak? that miscalculation goon." The general feeling foreshadows a serious reckoning for the Government when the time comes The "Daily Chronicle" hints that General Sir W T illiam Butler, who was recalled from the Cape command be cause of his Boer sympathies, long ago advised the Government that the prose cution of Mr. Chamberlain's policy would make heavy reinforcements for the Cape imperative. The "Daily News" says: The Govern ment decision is either a council of panic or the confusion of utter miscal culation. THE RECORD-UNION. HOSPITAL SHIP MAINE. Banquet at Carlton House Realises £2,000 for the Fund. LONDON, Dec. 17.—The farewell banquet at Carleton Hotel last evening In aid of the fund of the American hospital ship Maine realized £2,000. Among those present were the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the Mar quis of Lome, United States Embassa dor Choate and Mrs. Choate, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, Lady Randolph Churchill, Mrs. Arthur Paget, Count Boyn, the Austro-Hungarlan Em bassador and Baron de Staal, the Rus sian Embassador. Other guests in the company of 300 were Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, Brit ish Embassador to Spain; Prince Dem idoff, Princess yon Hatzfeldt, the mem bers of the Maine Committee, and the doctors. After the banquet a concert was given by American artists. 

GENERAL BULLER'S DEFEAT. Means More for Great Britain Than the Mere Loss of a Battle. I 'BERLIN, Dec. 17.—General Buller's (defeat In the engagement at the Tugela I River has not affected the German mon ey and stock markets seriously. Never theless, the money stringency is grow ing daily and private discount has equaled the official rate since Thurs day. Financial circles are now expecting an advance by the Reichsbank any day. Apparently the Reichsbank is only awaiting the action of the Bank of England. According to information from within the bank, the advance in the rate may become necessary at any ' moment, and the money situation will grow tighter. In consequence of Gen eral Buller's repulse London exchange is already above the gold point. Only the tacit agreement of the great private banks not to embarrass the Reichbank prevents large gold exports. The gold movement from New York to London, ; however, is expected to give temporary I relief. Domestic industrials have remained ' firm because of the situation in the ' coal and iron centers, where improve ment of business continues. The province of Brandenburg will is sue a loan of 12,000,000 marks for the construction of subsidiary railroads, and the city of Berlin will build an i extensive system of underground rail j ways. At a meeting of the Cologne Manu j facturers' Association yesterday Man ! ager Stellar reported upon the recent Philadelphia conference, greatly belit tling its importance. He advised against the appointment of an international committee to investigate the tariff dis agreement between Germany and the United States, and said: "Such tender consideration for th? Americans is misplaced. Only a self assertive attitude on the part of the German nation can impress American I public opinion. We must make the j Americans understand, also, that we i can dispense with them. if necessary, : and we must demand that Germany be treated upon a footing of decent, rea sonable reciprocity." A distinguished member of the diplo -1 matic corps, in the course of a discus sion to-day regarding General Buller"s . reverse, said: "It means morally far more for Great Britain than the mere loss of the bat tle. Her prestige after the defeat of ; last week has fallen enormously on the Continent, and it will be many years before she will again venture to as sume a tone against a great Power such as she took in the Fashoda affair." i Prince Franz Windisch-Graetz, who j was recently adjudged a bankrupt on account of debts incurred in gambling, is the husband of a distant cousin of the Emperor. The new Hamburg-American Line steamer Deutschland will be launched lat Stettin on January 3d in the pres ence of the Emperor. Baron yon Buelow ' will perform the ceremony of christen ing the new vessel. Most of the Berlin papers, as well as those throughout the country, comment upon General Buller's defeat in a seri ous and dignified tone, although with : considerable undercurrent of satisfac tion at England's humiliation all round ,It is admitted that Great Britain is now j fighting to save her South African pos sessions. The general belief is that Sir Redvers Buller acted prematurely and under pressure from the home Gov ernment. The official papers take a | rather gloomy view, as if apprehensive lof awkward complications. The "Kreuz Zeitung" says: "Great : Britain's decadence is now apparent to j the whole world." The "Voerwaerts" hopes the war will ! result in the establishment of the Unit ed States of Africa on a republican ba ' sis, but it is also convinced that such an outcome would not affect Great Brit ain's position as a great Power. The "Vossische Zeitung" thinks It | would be hopeless for England to match herself against a great Power. The military critics severely criticise British tactics. PRO-BOER MEETING. Dublinites Protest Against Honors to Joseph Chamberlain. DUBLIN, Dec. 17.—The announce ment that a pro-Boer meeting would be convened to-day as a protest against the proposal of Trinity College to con j fer a degree upon Joseph Chamber j lain, led to exciting scenes. A large ' force of police was called out and the i troops were held in readiness. Maud Gonne, the so-called "Irish Joan of Arc." and James Connolly, the Irish Republican, drove in a wagonette to the place appointed for the meeting, which was attended by a large crowd. Mr. Connolly tried to speak, but was prevented by the police. The wagon ette then made a tour of the street, the crowd rapidly Increasing, cheering for the Boers, singing "God Save Ireland." and "We'll Hang Joe Chamberlain on a Sour Apple Tree," and using dis gusting expressions against the Queen, the empire and the army. While pass ing Dublin Castle the occupants of thfe wagonette waved the Transvaal flag defiantly, whereupon the police stopped the vehicle and seized the flag. The wagonette, attended by a large body of police, who often cleared the streets, then drove to the rooms of the Irish Transvaal committee, where Michael Davitt, William Redmond and J. O'Brien were waiting. A meeting of about GO persons was held, Messrs. Davitt Redmond and O'Brien speaking in violent condemnation of the war I . (Continued on Seventh Face.) SACRAMENTO, MONDAY MOENLNGr, DECEMBER 18, 1899.-EIGHT PAGES. CONGRESSIONAL INDICATIONS. Short Daily Sessions for the Senate And Vote of tbe House on the Currency Bill. Both Houses Will Adjourn for the Christmas Holidays on Wednes day—All Republicans Will Vote for the Currency Bill and It Is Expected to Receive at Least Eight Democratic Votes. WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—The Sen ate has no program for the present week and the indications are that short daily sessions will be held and very little business transacted. Both houses will adjourn for the Christmas holidays on Wednesday. Outside of official nom inations there is practically no business on the calendar, all important matters in committee having been delayed for the reorganization of the committees, effected at the close of business last week. So far no notices of speeches on any subject have been given and Senators generally express themselves as disposed to postpone the real bus iness of the session until after the re cess. It is expected that Xhe financial bill will be received from the House during the week. It will be referred to the Committee on Finance. This committee expects to make its report soon after the resump tion of business in the new year. The real work of the session will then begin. The two events of importance in the House this week before the adjourn ment for holidays on Wednesday will be the vote on the currency bill to-morrow after the reading of the journal and the announcement of committees on Tues day. The vote will be taken directly upon the passage of the bill. The re sult is a foregone conclusion, as it will command every Republican vote. The interest in the vote therefore lies only in the record of the Democratic disaf fection it will show. The Eastern Dem ocrats generally, with the exception of a few from New York, are not in line with their Democratic brethren from the South and West on the money question, but not all of them will vote for the bill. According to a careful canvass, made by Overstreet of Indi ana, who has had the bill in charge, It will receive eight Democratic votes at least, and he believes seven Democrats will dodge. He figures that the bill will have a majority of 35. So far as can be ascertained, no other business will be transacted by the House this week. REV. 

SMITH'S SOLUTION. What He Would Do in the Interest of Woman and the Home. ST. PAUL, Dec. 17.—Rev. George D. Smith of the People's Church, whose arguments against women wage earn ers have attracted so much attention all over the country, to-night presented his solution of the trouble. Dr. Smith said: "My statistics were taken from the very latest reports. The awful condi tions remain unchanged. The decrease of child labor has been paralleled by the increase in the labor of girls between 14 and IS years which is falsely called wo man labor. "Pour States forbid women to work in mines. These laws should be ex tended to about one hundred of their present occupations which are too se vere and too unhealthy. Then all girls under 18 years should be forbidden to be employed in commercial and indus trial pursuits. These measures would cut down woman labor one half. Then a movement, largely social and moral, but also by woman organizing, should be made effective to give women who do equal work with men the same wages. Thus the family standard of wages would supplant the individual standard. The various assaults upon the family must be resisted, for it is the social unit. The madonna with her own child in her arms must not be de throned to make room for the public woman. Divorce in this country is in creasing two and a half times as fast as the population. It parallels the in dustrial invasion of woman. In twenty years divorces have doubled in the State of Ohio, while marriages actually decreased." i 

CINCINNATI WANTS IT. Trying to Get the Democratic Na tional Convention. CINCINNATI, Dec. 17.—There will be a strong effort made to have the next Democratic National Convention held in Cincinnati. The building erected for the International Saengerfest last Juno lis still retained in expectation of having this convention here. It was desired by many t.o make an effort for the Re publican National Convention, but it was said that the Republican commit teemen would not consider an Ohio city, when it was conceded that an Ohio man would be renominated. It is understood that Colonel John R. McLean will do everything in his power for his native city, and other members of the Democratic National Committee are known to be favorable to this city. THREE GENERATIONS TRIED. Thomas Gallagher Convicted of Killing James Qninn. SCRANTON (Pa.), Dec. 17.—A mur der trial in which three generations of a family were defendants ended to-day with a verdict of manslaughter against Thomas Gallagher, aged 21, the young est of the four defendants, and acquittal for his brother, Joseph Gallagher; his mother, Ann Gallagher and his grand mother, Bridget Dempsey. The murder for which they were tried was the killing of James Quinn, Sr., at Carbendale Township in August last, during a quarrel between the Quinns iand Gallaghers, which began in a dis pute between the boys. The witnesses I were all positive that the fatal wound was caused by a stone? thrown by Thomas Gallagher. RUSSIA'S FINANCES. Her Agent Says They Are in a Sat isfactory Condition. WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—M. Rou towsky, the agent of the Ministry of Finance of Russia in Washington, in a communication to the Associated Press complains of the attempts which he says were made in Europe recently to create in this country the impression that the relations between the Govern ments of Japan and Russia were strained. "Immediately after the statements had been authoritatively denied by the- Russian Embassador and the Japanese Minister here," said M. Rotrtowsky, "other sensational rumors were' start ed, presumably at Berlin, and directed against the credit of the Russian p;m pire. These were followed by libels, directed against the eminent statesmen, to whose care was entrusted the credit, and appeal made to Japan in an article on Russian finances, to attack that country before her trans-Siberian rail road could be completed." M. Routowsky adds that in view of the fact that all of these false rumors and misstatements, if not exposed, might leave among capitalists and financiers in this country an erroneous impression, he has decided to give to the press some figures on the subject. These figures show that the finances of Russia are in a most prosperous con dition. SETTLE'S SUCCESSOR. Election to be Held in Louisville to Determine Who He la LEXINGTON (Ky.), Dec. 17. — The election of a successor in Congress to Mr. Settle, deceased, occurs to-morrow From present indications it will be the most quiet election ever held in the Seventh District- June Gayle, the Democratic candi date, seems to have slightly the better of the fight. Two powerful elements are working in his favor; one is« his conservative course toward Goebel, and the other is the soreness that still re mains against Owens, the fusion can didate, on the part of the Breckinridge following, as a legacy from the famous bitter fight in the -Owens-Breckinridge race.

MADRID, Dec. 17—Senor Sllvela, the Premier, replying to a question on the subject in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday said the report of an alliance between Spain and Russia based on the cession of Ceuta, the Spanish seaport town in Morocco, opposite Gibraltar was without foundation.

Purvis, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Princeton, N. J.. has been tendered and accepted a call to fill the pulpit of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, succeeding the late Dr. John Hall.

PASS AWAY. Admiral Dewey's Flag Lieutenant at Manila. Untenant Brumby Dead From Typhoid Fever. Follows Captain Gridley and Com mander Wood to the Beyond— His Death a Great Shock to the Admiral, as a Very Strong Friendship Had Grown Up Be tween the Two Men Through Years of Close Relations. WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.—Lieutenant Brumby, Admiral Dewey's Flag Lieu tenant in Manila, who has been ill with typhoid fever for several weeks, died at Garfield Hospital shortly after 0 o'clock this evening. The death of Lieutenant Brumby, while not unexpected, was a great shock to Admiral Dewey. The rela tions of the two men for several years have been very intimate and a strong friendship had grown up between them. Lieutenant Brumby went out to the Asiatic station with the Admiral and had been there with him until they both returned to the United States. In his capacity as Flag Lieutenant, Lieu tenant Brumby was thrown with Dewey practically all the time and acted as his personal representative ln many matters of detail delegated to him by the commanding officer. He was regarded by the Admiral as a bright, alert and capable assistant, while the devotion of the latter to the Admiral was something marvelous. The bur den of his thoughts during the latter days of his illness, when his mind was wrecked with delirium, seemed to be regarding his work for the Admiral. No arrangements for the funeral have been made. Lieutenant Brumby was appointed a naval cadet from Georgia, entering the service in 1873, and his present com mission dates from the 24th of August, 1892. The Lieutenant's death is the third of .those who were closely associated with Admiral Dewey at the battle of Manila who have died since that time, namely, Captain Gridley, Commander W T ood and Lieutenant Brumby. Lieutenant Brumby was presented with a sword by the Legislature of Georgia on October 2Gth. He returned to "Washington about the middle of November.

MORE TROOPS NEEDED. Mexican Government Will Send Them Against the Yaquis. AUSTIN (Tex.), Dec. 17.—A special from Ortiz, State of Sonora, Mexico, states that the Mexican authorities are contemplating' sending more troops into the Yaqui, Indian country at once, as it is thought that the present force will not be able to cope with the situation. General Torres now has some 5,000 men, but it will take at least that many more or possibly twice that number, owing to the geographical conditions surrounding the uprising which pre vents successful military movements. The Indians are so scattered that un less more troops are sent to the front to engage the small roving bands they j will continue to depredate the country i and harass the soldiers under General | Torres until they wear them out. There are now about 1,500 Indians engaging the attention of the soldiers, while the remainder of the 5,000 braves who are on the warpath have scattered into small roving bands for the purpose of pilfering. These roving bands of In dians are capturing supply trains sent out to the Mexican forces in the field. They have of late captured several trains containing provisions and am munition.

BEATS MARCONI. Receiver for Wireless Telegraphy 2,000 Times More Sensitive. PITTSBURG. Dec. 17. —Bold re searches by Professor Reginald Fessen den and his assistant, Professor Kitner, in the electrical laboratory of the West ern University of Pennsylvania, have resulted in the production of a receiver for wireless telegraphy that is two thousand times more sensitive than the so-called "coherer" of the Marconi sys tem. In speaking of the discovery to-day Profeseor Fessenden said: "Although we have improved the re ceiver so that it is 2,000 times as sen sitive as the original one, we realize that we have not yet got to the limit. It should be possible to send messages across the Atlantic with poles less than 200 feet high. The ultimate resistance must be checked by actual experiment before it becomes a scientific fact in the strictest sense." BROADWAY NATIONAL BANK. Force of Clerks Working to Straighten Out Its Accounts. BOSTON, Deo. 17.—A force of clerks worked all day to-day straightening out the accounts of the Broadway Na tional Bank which suspended yester day. There have been no developments to day and the clearing house committee did not meet last night as expected. It is still the subject of much discussion that the clearing house did not come to the relief of the Broadway Bank as it did for the Globe Bank earlier in the week and this feature of the failure Is likely to continue uppermost in mind until the situation is made more clear. The work accomplished to-day was in the way of tabulating assets, and while much remains to fill out the offi cial papers, it is anticipated that a de tailed report to the Comptroller will go forward late to-morrow. Mr. Wing will continue to accept payments on notes becoming due, but will not pay out any bank funds. Everything, ap parently, depends upon what action Comptroller Dawes takes on receipt of Mr. Wing's report. NATIONAL STARCH COMPANY. Its Reorganization Proceeding Un der the Plan of the Syndicate.

WHOLE NO. 19, 00. ELECTIONS IN PORTO RICO. Progressing Slowly and Will Take Two Months More, There Being Still Over Forty-Five Toms to Vote. Republicans Claim That the Elec tions Throughout the Island Will Result in an Overwhelm ing Federal Defeat—The Texas Is at Havana and Will Bring Home the Bodies of the Maine Victima (Correspondence Record-UnionJ SAN JUAN (Porto Rico), Dec 12.— The elections in Porto Rico are pro gressing slowly. The Republicans car ried Ponce on December 9th by about 1,500 majority. According to the census of 1897 there are over 45,000 people in the Ponca district, but of that number only 4,400 are eligible to vote, the right of suffrage being limited to tax payers and profes sional men, about 4,400 of that number going to the polls. The Republicans! claim that San Juan will give them a, tremendous majority and that the flec tion throughout the island will result! in an overwhelming Federal defeat. The elections will last for at least two months more, there being still oves) forty-five towns to vote. The people are looking forward anx iously to the action of Congress on tha question of civil government. Many expect that Porto Rico will bo imme diately given a system of self govern ment of the islands, while others take a more conservative view of the sub ject. The "Boletin Mercantile," com menting on the subject, says: "The form of civil government for Porto Rico will undoubtedly be the one recommended by President McKinley in his annual message to Congress. With the exception of the highest office) —the appointee for which place is not yet known—the appointments will be distributed among the most capable Porto Ricans and Americans." THE

DENVER, Dec. 17.—A special to the "News" from Cheyenne, Wyo., says: The officials engaged in hunting tha criminal who robbed the Pacific Ex press Company in this city recently have obtained a definite clew. They have found a person who saw a man leaving the north door of the express office during the time the robbery must have been committed. He had a pack age under his coat and was last seen to. board a train going west. An accurate description of the man has been fur nished. It is known that he left the train on its arrival at Laramie.
