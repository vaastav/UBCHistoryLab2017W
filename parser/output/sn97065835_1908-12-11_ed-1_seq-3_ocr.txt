The insurgents are intent upon securing what they consider their "rights," and the dove of peace is only dimly discernible in the dim distance, while the dogs of war are tugging at their chains, anx ious to be released. The develop ments at tomorrow's meeting, and the subsequent session of the Na tional Commission may turn all ran dom into a turmoil and set father against son and brother against brother.

F., Dec. 4.—Wreck age, which has come to shore at Cape iRace, leaves little room for doubt that the sturdy little steam er. "Sionx City," which for twenty years plied as an excursion steamer on the great lakes, went down with her crew in a gale that lashed the New Found-land coast for two days this week. The steamer was in com mand of Capt. John Dillon, of Brook lyn, formerly commander of the United States transport Missouri. The exact number of the crew is in doubt but it is known, however, that no less than eighteen men were on board and it has been reported that the crew was recently increased to twenty-eight men. The "Sioux City" hailed from Michigan City on November 1st, and reached Ogdensburg, N. Y., on Nov ember 11th. At that port she took on ^oal and added four men to her crew. She was lasit reported at Quebec, on November 14th. A week later, when nothing had been heard from her, much anxiety was felt and on Wednesday last the vessel was listed by the marentime exchange among the missing. The "Sioux City" was Tecently sold by the Indiana Transportation Company to Felix Jackson, of Vel asco, Tex., and was being taken to New Orleans where she was to have been placed In commission between that city and Texas ports. The ves sel carried no passengers. Fraud in Primary.

The charges range from 'illegal voting to conspiracy to com mit traud. jfcfMkii' y—r w".*' f:'- L-',-'' MESSAGE FINISHED. President Roosevelt's Message will be a Summary of His Admin istration. Washington, Dec. 3.—President Roosevelt's last annual message to congress is now known tc be prac tically finished, and those who have had opportunity to glance at it con tents declare that it is a veritable classic and will take rank as one of the most important state papers ever written by a president of the United States. It has been the president's ambition to make this message a summary and a faithful register of his administration, and he has spent many months striving to accomplish this effect. Aside from its literary merits, its umusual clarity and its summing up of past history, the message will ad vocate many measures of practical reform. In this respect it will be quite up to the standard set by the president in past messages. Much attention will be paid in the message to questions of economic re form in which labor is deeply in terested. One of t'he most striking features will he the recommendation of an amendment to the Sherman an ti-trust law exempting labor organ izations from its provisions and the passage of an anti-injunction law along the lines proposed last year. Under a recent supreme court de cision in the Danbury hatter's case labor unions conducting a boycott came within the conspiracy clause. Wihether the president will push his fight for a larger navy be rec commending the annual construction of four monster battleships has not been decided. He will at any rate ask for two. Additional fortifications for the Philippines and for seacoast defenses in this country will be strongly urg ed, and it may be that the president will decide to ask for a reorganiza tion of the navy bureaus. Congress will be requested to broaden the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the super vision rates before they become ef fective. The difficulties encountered in the adjustment of the interstate rates by states having rairoad com missions have raised a demand for additional federal legislation that the president believes will meet with hearty support even by the majority party in congress. The postal savings bank project of ho postmester-general will receive hearty indorsement and an earnest recommendation that be speedily enacted into law. The great growth of prohibition sentiment and th.e demand of the states that the federal government meet the "original package" decision of the supreme court will be touched (upon. The president will also recom mend legislation requiring publicity of campaign contributions. He has not yet indicated whether he will repeat his previous recom mendation for the enactment of an inheritance and income tax, but he will press for a federal incorporation license and for the enactment of a new employers' liability law. The president will take advantage of certain crticisms in the last con gress as to the advisability of send ing the Atlantic fleet into Asiatic wa ters by pointing out the feeling of international amity that followed its triumphant progress, and the great advantages, commercially and other wise, which he believes will accrue in Japan, China and other points in the Orient. Statehood for New Mexica and Ari zona will not be neglected, nor will Appalachian Forest Reserve. Also 1 his advocacy of the adoption of a policy looking to the purchase of at least one legation site a year will be renewed. The plac-ing of dates upon the la bels of packing house products and the payment of the cost of inspec tion by the packers is another matter to which he will call attention. The demand for uniformity in divorce laws will be reiterated as well as national child labor legislation. Although it is generally under stood that the president will leave to his successor the treatment of tariff revision, the desirability of placing wood pulp on the free list will again be pointed out. Washington, Dec. 3.—The ways and means committee of the house which has been holding daily ses sions for some time, will complete its tariff revision hearing tomorrow, and will immediately begin work on its report. It is npt expected that definite action will be taken to change the tariff law during the session of congress opening next week, but that this will be left, for a special session to be called by Mr. Taft immediately after his inaugura tion next, March. Among those responsible for the assertion that the comin? congress will not take up the subject of tar :y revision is Senator Hale, who speaks as one having authority. Nor oes he believe that the congression al monetary commission of which he is a member, will soon be ready to advise any radical changes in the nation's financial system. Speaking of immediate tariff re vision, Senator Hale said: "Once in a while you will hear such a sug gestion. but it is clearly out of the question and it will not be under taken. And It is safe to say that there will not be any radical changes when the much talked of revision is made. "iRecent events have made It cer tain that there will bo no slaughter ing of Interests. It is clear that the country does not expect nor court such a course, and congress will not enter upon it." The senator expects the extra ses sion to be called very soon after March 4. Jle does not count upon .any Important legislation beyond the passage of the appropriation bills during the last session of the present congress. "W« learned a number of interact­ ing facts during our visit to Europe last summer, and have done much work in this country," he said, "but it will necessarily be some time be fore we shall be in a position make any definite suggestions for the modification of the monetary system of the lUnited States. It is a big subject and will require care ful attention. It is possible that we may ask to have some changes made in the law regulating the inspection of banks, but if that is done it will be merely incidental." Next week's conventions of the waterways congress and other con servation bodies may have an im portant bearing on the appropriation bills to be passed by the coming ses sion. An exceptionally large ap propriation for rivers and harbors improvement is confidently expected by the friends of suoh proposals. There is hardly a member of con gress from any part of the country who has not in his district one or more navigable streams and it is safe to assume that every effort pos sible will be put forth this winter to secure as large a general appro priation as possible. There is no election ahead now and for that rea son there will be no need of fearing that the people will cry extravagance and t.he bill is going to be a big one, if the information that knowing ones have given is correct, and judg ing from present prospects every steam in the country is going to be come navigable before the next ses sion of congress is over. Another noticeable feature in con nection with the approaching ses sion is that a very large number of men—democrats and republicans alike—failed of renomination and these are going to put in some good work for their people before they give up t'heir seats. There are many cases on record where men have been side-tracked for a time and later returned to congress, and some of those who failed to be re-elected take that view of the situation. Instead of giving up and saying there's no use as they will soon be cut any way, the majority of the unfortunate fellows are looking at the matter optimistically and hoping that in the ever-changing political game bliiey may come to the front. For that rea son they are going to exert them selves more than ever to make good during their last days. Lcmmon Anxious for County Seat. Pierre, S. D., Dec. 4.—The people of Lemmon are anxious to begin the organization of Perkins county but no action will likely be taken until Harding county is ready to proceed, and the Lemmonites are working up the petition for their neighborhood county. C. E. Lem mon, Logan Berry and others from the new town were in this city yesterday looking up the matter, and went on to Belle Fourche, and the country north of that place, with the hope of getting back in a few days with the required petition to put the machinery of organization into motion for both the new coun ties. The fight for county seat in Perkins county, is Lemmon against the field, with the towns of Meadow, Bison, Davison and others are want ing the honor farther south in the county. The chances are favorable to Lemmon unless the different com peting points get together on one place. In Harding county. Camp Crook appears to have the lead, al though Harding and one or two oth er places are showing signs of mak ing a try for the honor. Church Sleeting at Mitchell. Mitchell, S.

AU-Xight Bank. Philadelphia, Dec. 4.—Despite the general belief that the Quaker City goes to bed at 9 o'clock, Phil adelphia is soon to have an "owl" or all-night bank to accommodate those who prowl about during the night watches. The new Institu tion will be conducted on the con tinuous plan and will have counting room and offices in the northwest corner of the Bellevue-Stratford. It will have a capital of $r00,000 ?nd number among its stockholders and promoters, George C. Boldt. of the Waldorf-Astoria, and the Belle vue-Stratford, and Laurence MeCor mick.

The Denver players do not expect to defeat the redskins but hope to be able to keep the score down. Death in the Deep. Shelburne, N.

HUNTER IS ARRESTED. Ed. Spntz, of Meckling, Fined for Illegal Shipping of Game. Vermillion. S. D., Dec. 5.—It cost Ed. Spats',, of Meckling, a neat little sum to settle with the Clay county authorities for his illegal shipping of game, but the Meckling hunter and trapper still has a little settle ment. to make with Uncle Sam. It. was thought at the time htat if he paid a fine here that this would be the end of It. But a deputy United States marshal yesterday took Spatz to Sioux Falls, where ,lie will be in dicted under the Lacey act.. The act which led to Spatz's ar rest was the discovery of a shipment of snipe, prairie chickens and ducks that he was sending by express to market. In all, it is said, there were between 75 and 100 birds in the shipment. King Corn to Reign.

SIXTIETH CONGRESS CONVENED. Ready for President Roosevelt's Last Annual Message. Washington, December 7.—Re sembling more a social function than a serious assemblage for the trans action of the business of the nation, the Sixtieth Congress convened to day for its final session. A brilliant array of diplomats, society women, and relatives of members filled the galleries when the gavel was sounded in the House of Representatives and the Senate chamber. So great was the demand for an opportunity to see the national leg islature started in its work, that the galleries of the house were re served for the families and friends of members, with very few places left for the general public. In the Senate the same condition prevailed, except that a large space was kept for those who came without tickets. Early in the day the Capitol was filled with spectators, and in all the corridors leading to the gallery en trance there were lines of men and women extending for long distances, and many of these people stood for hours in a vain hope of gaining ad missions as the more fortunate should become wearied and give up their places. Greatest interest today attaches to the President's message. Tills will lie the last annual message of Pres ident iltoosevelt, prior to his retire ment on March 4 next, and it is de clared to bo a summary of the ac complishments and ambitions, real ized and unrealized, of his admin istration. Although the Big Stick is not the menace to recalcitrant legis lators that it once was, It is certain that the congressmen will give care ful attention to the recommendations of the president. The membership of the Senate and the House remains unchanged for the present session. With an ex ception or two, no new men will come into either branch, after March 4, who can be forceful factors for liberating the lawmaking power. The older men who hold positions of leadership or of influence in the House are arguing that an analysis of tho November elections disclose little or nothing that can be inter preted as a rebuke to the policies adopted on tho Hill for Llie last four years. Senate leaders are a little loss serene in tliov attitude, because the western elections will bring a few progressive republicans into that body, as well as an additional dem ocrat or two. It is unlikely that little Important business aside from appropriations, will be transacted by the present ses sion. The demand for a largely In creased appropriation for waterways, which will be made at the present of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress this week may be acceded to, and this is likely to be one of the most important measures of this Congress, so far as direct benefit to the whole people is concerned. Tho statement of Chairman Payne of the House Committee on Ways and Means, that the new tariff hill will he framed during the present session of Congress, for enactment into law at a special session has failed to end the discussion as to how the tariff will be revised. The framing of a bill at this ses sion is taken by some who claim to be fighting for a thorough revision of the tariff as an indication that the schedules would be revised too hastily and without intention of much damage. Reports that manu facturers, importers and others in terested were not given time to pre pare for the hearings, and for argu ment, when before the committee on ways and means are in circulation. The fight on Speaker Cannon Is causing much talk among the legis lators today. The argument of the speaker's supporters takes this form: The op position is not so much against Mr. Cannon as against the stand-pat members of the Ways and Means Committee, especially Chairman Payne and Representative Dalzell. Mr. Cannon did not put those men on the committee. The late Speak er Reed put them there. They and other leading members of the com mittee secured their present places through the system of committee ad vancement which has prevailed in the House for 50 years. If Mr. Taft is making any war on the House or organization, as found in Ways and Means, it is a war against the com mittee system which has grown up there. His success would mean the turning out of Chairman Payne and Mr. Dalzell and placing the revision of the tariff in the hands of other men. A fairly amicable adjustment of relations between republicans who will loom large in the next admin istration is looked for soon. The seeming differences between Presi dent-elect Taft and Speaker Cannon will likely disappear. The incoming senators and representatives are very adverse to a party quarrel or to widening the breach between the two factions of the party. Patronage will be very effective in bringing recalcitrant congressmen around. A new President has the appointment of a great number of federal office holders, whose selec*. tion originates, under the original' conditions, with senators and repre sentatives. The postmasters form only a small portion of these oflices, where the indorsement of senators and representatives on friendly terms with the President, are equi valent to nomination. The comparatively small majority in the House will likewise be a de terent to the Republican leaders. In recent years ther? has been a nuia-. ber of revolts against the house or-. ganization. If Mr. Taft and Mr. Cannon should have a sharp falling out about legislative policies, it not be difficult to form a group nf progressive western republicans. That progressive western republicans. That number acting and voting in dependently could harrass the leader ship very effectively. All the prospects will be well talked over during the short session of congress. There has been little opportunity yet for congress to de termine whether Mr. Taft will be more or less forceful than Mr. Roosevelt in getting what he wants in legislation. The leaders are uncertain whether he will play as masterful a hand against them as Mr. Roosevelt has played, but they feel more friendly to him than they have to any other incoming president for the last 20 years, except McKinley, and there is a very general desire among repub licans to start off well with him. Campaign Publicity. During the present session, the National Publicity Bill Organization, if which Perry Belmont is president, will renew Its propoganda for the en actment of a .federal law compelling publication of (campaign contribu tions in all national and state elec tions. There Is such a bill already the calandar of the House of Representatives, which failed of passage only because there was at tached to it a "force bill" in the •losing moments of the last session by those controlling the House, who lid not desire to have any such law apply in the recent Presidential el ection. This hill provides for the publi cation of campaign expenses both jofore and after election, very much ifter the fashion that was observed iy the Democratic rational Commlt ee in the recent campaign. Rules Revision. Representative Charles E. Town end, of Michigan, who has been .poken of as speaker of the next House, has commenced a crusade for rules revision. "The only active campaign I will make," saiO Mr. rownsend, "is not for he speaker ship. but for a revision of the House rules so that the speaker and his party colleagues on the Committee on Itules will not be the whole thing. Several of our strongest revisionists were defeated at the election. Their defeat naturally weakens the revi sion forces. Still, we are going to make a fight." Sherman in the House. Behold of all beholders on the floor of the House today, looming even larger in the public eye than "Uncle Joe" Cannon, was Represen tative Sherman, the vice president elect. When Mr. Sherman took his old seat in the front row of tho House today to serve out his term as a member of the Sixtieth congress, his fellows witnessed a vice-presl lent elect take part In its deliber ations for a second time in the his tory of that body. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, and like Mr. Sherman, a native of New York, continued to serve as speaker of the house for half a term in this fortieth congress after he had been elected vice-pres ident on the ticket headed by Ulysses S. Grant. On March 3, 1869, Schuyler Col fax resigned as speaker In order that he might prepare for his inau guration £s vice-president. He called Representative James F. Wilson, ot Iowa, to the chair, and moved the election of Theodore M. Pomeroy, of New York, as speaker. The mo tion was carried unanimously, and for one day Mr. Pomeroy acted in that capacity. The fortieth Congress ended on March 4, and James G. Blaine was elected speaker of the 41st. Mr. Colfax remained as a Speaker even during the counting and reoordlng of the electorial votes which made him vice president, and although this action caused some comment at the time it was finally decided that it. was parliamentary and constitutional. Mr. Sherman will have no official part to take in his formal election, which takes place in February, al though he will be as acfive In legis lative affairs in this session as he has been in the past. To him will fall the principal work of framing the Indian appropriation bill, while his work on the Rules Committee and the Interstate and Foreign Com merce Committee is expected to give him. a busy session in the House .be fore he goes to the Senate to .pre side over that body. Southern Commercial Congress.
