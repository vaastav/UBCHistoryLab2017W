THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WINK, Kditor 4. PltOFftltTO. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1889. THE FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS. The fifty-first Congress of the United Rules sat down tn the halls of its fathers Monday. The House was called to order at 12 o'clock by John 13. Clark, the Clerk of the House in the Fiftieth Congress. The roll was then called and showed 527 members present. Nominations for Speaker were called fr. Mr. Townsend, of Illinois, nomi nated Thomas B. Reed and Mr. Mc Creary, of Kentucky, nominated John G. Carlisle. Tellers were appointed, and on a viva voce vote Mr. Reed re ceived tho full vote of the Republican members, and was declared elected Speaker. After Speaker Reed had taken the oih, the organization of the House was completed by the election of Ed ward McPberson as Clerk; A. J. Holmes, Sergeant at-Arms; Chas. V. Adams, Doorkeeper ; Rev. Wro. II. Millburn, Chaplain, Democrat, elect ed over the regular caucus nominee. There was little or no excitement attenJing the opening of the Fifty 6rst Congress in the Senate side of the Capitol. The publio curiosity seemed to be largely transferred to the House side. Interest on the floor was devoted largely to the Senators from the new States. They had had seats assigned to them on the Republican side of the chamber. Senator Casey, of North Dakota, took bis seat on the end of the second row against the north wall Directly behind him sat the Washing ton Senators, Allen and Squire, while Tetligrew and Moody, of South Da kota, were in the fourth row near the center of the room. Senator Tierce, of North Dakota, has the end seat in the fourth row, bat be was not present to day. On the Democratio side are two seats so far onassigned. Tbey wi.l be occupied by the Senators from Montana when they have been chosen. Flowers adorned the desks of several members. The President's message was read in both Houses yesterday. It is quite leogthy, and the topics of the times are discussed in a statesmanlike man ner. We will issue it to our readers in supplemental form as soon as the same can be gotten out. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular Correspondent.) Washington, Nov. 29, 1889. Tbe President and Mr. Harrison apent a very quiet Thanksgiving day at the White House. Tbey entertain ed at dinner Major Ernst, who was recently appointed superintendent of publio grounds and buildings in this city. The Thanksgi ving turkey at the White House came from Rhode Island. Commissioner Kaum has issued a circular requesting that all applicants for pensions sign their full name to tbe application, instead of the initials only. First Assistant Postmaster General - Clarkson is reorganizing his office in order to keep up with the rapidly in creasing business which comes before it. The Industrial Congress of the United States, which was in session here this week, passed a resolution in favor of holding tbe Columbus Expo tition of 1892 at Washington. Tbe Attorney General has given his opinion that men who were enlisted in what was knowu as the "quartermaster brigade" or "quartermaster's volun teers" during the late war are to be considered as being in the "Military service of the United States," and honorably discharged, within tbe in tent of Rule 10, of the Civil Service regulations. This is good news to roauy. Commissioner Raum has issued an order to the officials in the Pension office cautioning them to use tbe great est care in the rejection of applications for pensions and requiring all letters rejecting claims to be brought to the dusk of the Commissioner for signature. The Democratio members of the House held their caucus this evening and nominated Mr. Carlisle for Speak er, and all of tho present minor offi cials ot tho House. The nominations are, of course merely complimentary. Secretary Blaine gave a dinner to the members of the International Maritime conference Tuesday evening. Among the invited guests were the Vice President, Secretaries Noble and Rusk and the German and IkitUb ministers. The entertainment was markod by an innovation. There were no after dinner speeches. Assistant Secretary Iiussey, of the Ioterior department, in bis annual report devotes considerable space to defending his decisions .in pension cues, which be claims all tend to lib eralize the practice of the department. Senator Farwell smiles iu a peculiar way when atked if tbe rumor which lays he wilt not be a candidate for re- election is true. While the Senator does not say in so many words that he is a candidate for re-election be says enough to make the inference plain that he is. Nothing moro has been done in the cases of the five re-rated officials of the Tension office who were last week asked to resign, and refused to do so. There is a rumor that these men will not be dismissed, though that was Sec retary Noble's first intention. Secretary Troctor's annual report is a very interesting document. He makes a number of excellent recom mendations. He believes the proper way to prevent the large number of desertions in the army is to lessen the distanee between the commissioned officer and the private, and he shows how it can be done. Lynn, the great shoe manufacturing town of Massachusetts, was visited by a most disastrous fire last week, de stroying nearly the entire business portion of the city, and entailing a loss on the inhabitants from which they will not recover for maoy years. Boston, also, suffered a terrible loss by fire last week, it being little behind the great conflagration in that city in 1872. The insurance companies of the country were hit bard. A
