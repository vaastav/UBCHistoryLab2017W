NO STARTLING DISCLOSURES The Treatment of the Hawaiian Question a Reiteration of Gresham's Letter. The President Makes Numer ous Recommendations Based on Suggestions Contained in Re ports by Heads of Departments. By the Associated Press. Washington, D.O., Dec. 4. President Cleveland, in his message to congress commences by reviewing the relations of the United States with other coun tries, and eays : "While our foreign relations have not been entirely free from perplexing and embarrassing situations, nothing re mains that will not yield to that spirit of fairness and love of justice which are joined with the consistent firmness which characterizes the true American foreign policy." He Strikes Egan. Speaking of the Brazilian revolution, the president says : "The United States does not recognize the rebels ; therefore the action of Commodore Stanton in saluting the rebel admiral is disavowed in a manner not to be misunderstood." The action of the late minister to Chili in harboring two revolutionists is de nounced. The president says: "Under no circumstances can a rep resentative of this government be per mitted to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in countries to which he is accredited." Chinese Exclusion. Legislation on the Geary act is re viewed and, the president says : "It is believed that under the amendment to the act, Chinese laborers will avail themselves of the renewed privilege of establishing their right to remain, and thereby the necessity of enforced de portation may, to a great degree, be avoided." Of the Nicaragua canal, he says: "That the canal should be accomplished under distinctively American auspices is a proposition which in my judgment does not admit of a question." Speak ing of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa, under the partite agreement, he says : "This incident and the events leading up to it signally illustrate the impolicy of entangling alliances with foreign powers. Hawaiian Affairs. Of Hawaii, the president eays : "The questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just prior to the instal lation of the present administration the existing government of Hawaii had been overthrown and a treaty of annexation negotiated between a provisional gov ernment of the islands and the United States and submitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination and dispatched James H. Blount to Honolulu as special com missioner to make an impartial investi gation of the circumstances attending the change of government. After a thorough examination Mr. Blount sub mitted to me hia report, showing be yond all question that the constitu tional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representatives to that government and through intimidation caused by the presence of the armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable coarse for onr government to pursue was to undo the wrong done by those representing the United States. "With a view of accomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of the executive power the present minister at Honolulu has received ap propriate instructions to this end. Thus far no information of an accom plishment of definite results has been received from Hawaii. Additional ad vices are soon expected. When received they will promptly be sent to congress, accompanied by a special executive message." A New Financial System. Alter quoting statistics from the re port of the secretary of the treasury, the president says : "The recent repeal of the law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency atlairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. After tne recent hnancial perturbation, tine is required for the re-establishment of Business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence money which has been frightened into hoard ing places has been returned to trade, in a survey the of situation for this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, de termined to be content with nothing Iosb than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In the circumstances 1 am' convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of oeing injurious will increase the proba bility of wise action." The president recommends a lurther postponement ot the Brussels monetary conference and suggests that general authority be given the president to invite other nations to such conference at any time when there is a fair prospect ot accomplishing an international agreemeut on the subject cQpoinage. He also recommends that the existing statutes governing the is suance of government bonds he amend ed as the authority of the secretary of the treasury is not sumciently clear. Foreign Immigration. The superintendent of immigration reports that during the last fiscal year 44U,79o immigrants arrived atonrp;rts; ot tnese luud were not permitted to land lhe president recommends a more gen erai ana narmomous national quaran tine system at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies. ' Changes In the Army System. Owing to the efficiency of the national board of organization and the lessening of the danger of Indian hostilities to the country, a change which contemplates BJ increase in the number of trooos or abided expense is sugsted. The repeal of the law forbidding the re-enlistment of soldiers after ten years service is recommended, also appropriations by congress to complete the work of coast defense. The Mall Service. The president is of the opinion that the system of a free delivery of the mails should not be extended to smaller communities than are now designated. Attention is called to the value of civil service reform in the postal service. The Navy, Of the navy the president says: "While I am distinctly in favor of pursuing the policy we have inaugurated in building up a bor ough and efficient navy, I cannot refrain from suggesting that congress should carefully take into account the number of unfinished vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of the treasury in considering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new. work. Pension Frauds. The president quotes the report of the secretary of the interior, to the ef fect that last June there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 89,944 over the previous year. Speak ing of the recent rulings of the com missioner of pensions, the president says: "I am nuable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sen timent in which the pensions have their origin. Those who attempt, in the line of duty, to rectify these wrongs should not be accused of en mity or an indiffer ence to the claims of honest veterans." Distribution of Public Lands. The scenes attendant npon the open ing of the Cherokee Strip receives the president's attention and he says: "These outrageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject. I especially commend to the attention of congress the statements contained in the secre tary's report concerning registry."' Department of Agriculture. The president calls attention to the importance to farmers of the depart ment of agriculture and also to the un wieldy proportions to which the collec tion and distribution of new seeds has grown. Civil Service Reform. Of civil service reform the president ays in part: "The continued intelli gent, execution of the civil service law and its increasing approval by the peo ple of its operation are most gratifying. I am, if possible, more than ever con vinced of the incalculable benefits con ferred by the civil service law, not only in its effect upon the public service, but also in what is even more important, its effect in elevating the tone of politi cal life. In general there underlies this reform a sturdy common sense not only suited to this sphere, but whose appli cation our people are more and more recognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful operation of the government if not to its perpetuity." Congressional Economy. The president favors economy in pub lic expenditures and earnestly urges AT IT

The American Tramp Has a Friend In Kansas. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 4. The Times Topeka special says: Governor Lewelling has issued an extrordinary addresB to all boards of police com missioners in Kansas which practically renders nugatory all vagrant laws. He criticizes the manner in which the existinglaws are being enforced upon the unemployed with regard to their being; ordered to leave town and move on. This, he says, is a violation of the right of personal liberty guaranteed by the constitution of the United States and there is no power in the legislative or city council to deprive the people of this right. He regards the practice of compelling vagrants to work out their fines in work houses. He says it is a violation of a constitution provision and calls on police commissoners to carry out the spirit of these suggestions.

Barkentine Klikita, Capt. Cotter, ar rived today from Honolulu with ad vices to November 20, four days after the steamer Alameda sailed for San Francisco. Minister Willis submitted to an interview directly after the Alameda sailed, in" which he said that hia in structions from the United States gov ernment which he brought from Wash ington were not applicable to the con- dition of affairs then existing in the irlands. The statement gave the an nexationists much satisfaction and the royalists were much displeased. On account of many rumors current of the contemplated restoration of the queen the supporters of the provisional government found it necessary to keep two companies of soldiers nnder arms for several nights after the Alameda sailed. The editor of the Evening Star requested Minister Willis to submit a statement to the public to allay the general feeling of uncertainty. In his published interview Willis said: "Yes, I believe that the time has come when it is right and proper for me to use my discretion in the matte?. You are authorized to Bay for me that no change in the present situation will take place for several weeks. I brought with me cer tain instructions from the Ui.ited States government on the Hawaiian situation but siiice my arrival contin gencies have arisen about which neither the Usited States government nor my self were aware when I left Washing ton. I huve thought best in the exer cise of the diecrttion allowed me to submit these matters to Washington before proceeding further to carry out my original instructions. "I forwarded my dispatches to Wash ington by today's steamer and until I receive an answer to them no change will take place in the present situation nor will any be allowed." "What do you mean by the expres sion, 'Nor will any be allowed?' " . "I mean just this, that until the time comes for me to carry out my in etructions the peace and good order of this community will be kept undis turbed in the interests of humanity; that any attempt made by any person or persons to make trouble will be promptly checked and punished. 'Yon may put the matter more plainly and say that if even the provisional gov ernment discharged all its troops today no lawlessness would be allowed for one moment under the present situa tion of affairs. "The whole Hawaiian question is now in abeyance and nothing that the news papers can say or do will alter the situ ation an iota. I make this statement on my own responsibility and in the. hope that it will allay the present ex citement. No one need fear trouble and no lawlessness will be permitted." After this statement rumors began to fly about that the queen's supporters would make a final rally in her behalf. Two companies of troops remained under arms and the crews of the United States ' men - of - war Philadelphia and Adams were held in readiness to be landed on a moments notice. The queen's advocate came out on the nextday with a denial of Wil lis interview, saying he was mis quoted and then by inference gave encouragement to the idea that Willis had or would receive imperative orders to restore the queen.
