"One generation pasa eth aav and am ther generation cometb, I ll' tho enrih ahldeth forever " It is of the Hist iinporiftuce to duly consider fti d esti mate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United Ststes.is well ndapted to be the home of one" national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of climftte and productions, are of advantage in tbe age of i ne people, what ever they might have been in f .riner ages Steam, and telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these to lie an advantageous coird inlion for one united people. . In the Inaugural Addres I br i fly point ed out the total inadequacy of disunion li ft remedy fr d fl rentes beiweeti tbep"0- plo ol the two s.C'inns. I did so iu lan guage which I caunot improve, and wbtcb, therefore, I beg to repeat. One section of our country believes slav ery is r gbl and ought to be extended, while li e other believes it ia wrong nnd ought not to fe extended. This is tho ouly substan tial dispute. The luguive slave clause of the Consti tution ami tho law for tho suppression ot the African slnve trade, are each as well en forced, perhaps as any law Can ever l o in a comii unity where the tin ral sense s of ihe i-eople iii. peifect'y supports tho law iweif. The great baly of the people abnle by the legal i bltga-hms in both cases, and ft few t.teak oVer each. This. 1 ibinfe, cannot e K-rtecHy cured, aild H wouid la worse in oi.tb inaiai c a after sepnruuon of ihu ttc tiuiis ihag before. The toreigu slave trade, now imperfe'Cl -J suppressed, would be ultimately revived wuh out restriction in one section, while fu gitives now only parimlly surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the oth er. PhvR'Cally s caking, we cannot sepa rate. We cannot leniove our reajacnve actions Irom each other, nor build an mi p.issablu wad la-lwei n them.
