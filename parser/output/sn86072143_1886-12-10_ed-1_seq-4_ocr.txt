Mr. Duvllt seems toknow what 1m Is talk ing nliotit. The "mystery" In the Moen-Wilson case, seems to bu pretty simple. It is al most all explainable on the theory that "the boy (Wilson) lied." Kven that, how ever, hardly explains why Mr. Moen paid him $3M),(KKI. It would s-eem as though thu oleomar garine tax might at least pay the ex penses of its own collection. The com missioner of internal revenue thinks that the receipts from the tax will reach at least 3,000,000. If President Cleveland wishes to read some entertaining lit unit tire during his term of Invalidism, he might perme the pledges which lie made previous to enter ing upon t he duties of the executive. He has evidently forgotten most of them. Some itilluential philanthropists in New York are milking an etrort to decrease the curse of intemperance in that city by es tablishing a system of cheap collee houses which are so successful in some F.iiglish cities. This is a commendable enterprise. Iu Secretary Lamar's report he states that Dakota has a population of 500,000 ; yet he fails to recommend its admission to the Unian as a State. This omission is accounted for by the fact that the repub lican majority of the territory is about 20,000. The Louisville Courier Journal is con ducting a series of criticisms upon the present administration, which seem to make the administration organs very un easy. Rut Mr. Wuterson lias the courage of his convictions, and Is determined to have his say. When the names of President Cleve land's cabinet were lirst mentioned to Samuel .1. Tildon, he said of the secretary of war, "Endicott will be a success." It he had added, "and the only success," his reputation as a seer and sage would now be even higher than it is. The London Xcicx thinks the nub of the fisheries trouble is that America wants fishing, while New Kngland does not want free trade. The A'cuvx is half right. New Kngland does not want free trade. And the United States can get lishing enough without asking favors from Can ada. It is reported that there is not a man, woman, buy or girl, of sound mind and over 15 years of age iu Jie Cherokee na tion, ivho can not read and wiite. The Cherokees are not only a civilized but an educated people, and in many respects they set a good example to their white neighbors. The lirattleboro Phumlx has added a column to its pages, incren-i d the length proportionally, and appears in a new dress. The. I'Honlx deserves its pro-purity. It is second to no weekly iu Ver mont in appearance, ability, independ ence, and all the qualities of a lirst rate paper. Mr. Powderly's assessment of U5 cents per member on the Knights of Labor is being ignored by many assemblies of the order, particularly iu the West. The American worklngmaii has about come to the conclusion that the hand of the master-workman lias been iu his pocket long enough. The appeal of the United church of New Haven, Conn., to the American board iu behalf of the missionary, Iter. Mr. lluine, lias been laid upon the table; and there, doubtless, it must lie, until certain vital questions connected witli the subject have been, at least, measurably settled. In the meantime, Mr. Hume's missionary Held will have to be at home. The story of "Doo" Wilson, that he was the son of Mr. Moen, the Worcester mil lionaire, who has been paying him so much money, appears to be thoroughly exploded. Wilson's mother, sisters, the atteudlug physician at his birth, the otli cial records, all unite to prove him the ton of Jonas Wilson and not of Moen. "Doc" still sticks to his story ; but nobody In orcester believes liim. Tho question among magazine writers ami readers is not, "Who wrote tho Junius letter!'" but "Who writes the Arthur Klchinoud letters." We are Inclined to think that these letters wero written by dlllerent persons. The stylo ot tho lost letter is certainly different from, and infe rior to, tho letter previously written. It Is imite possible that the editor of the North American fcpcio.Mr, Hlce, wrote the last Arthur Richmond letter himself. Since the geneial assessment levied by .Master Woikman Powderly on the Knights of Labor, the disintegration of that body appears to have begun In earn est. Six assemblies In New Jersey have thrown up their charters, and several Western assemblies have refused to pay the asssessmeiit. Chief Althur ot the locomotive engineers, once said : "Strikes mean assessments, and assessments mean doutk." Tin- New York Sun. which Is the most riptlous and complaining newspaper in tins country, prints n list of tl'o icpnbll c in attaches, clerks, etc , still ret lined by the (hmocratlo cabinet olllcers iu tludr di'paitineiits, and plaintively invokes the administration to supply their places with wa'tllig democrats. So Tar, however, the ndniliilst ration has evinced no haste to do the bidding of the .Sun. A committee has been appointed bj the board of aldermen of New York city, "to consider (lie advisability ot uniting the cities of New York, llrooklyn, Yonkeis, Long Island City, and such adjacent ten I lory as may be thought advisable, In one municipality." Should this lie accom plishedas it eventually will lie New York, or "Manhattan," will becxecuk d iu population by only one city on the globe Loudon. The artist Munkacy, in a talk with the Washington correspondent of the Now York ll'erif on matters aichlteetutal, said of the White Home: "The mo-t handsom.' building I have seen here is the White House. It is so grand, so stately, -oioomy. Its aichitecture is soinelliln to be greatly admlied. What astonishes ine most is to behold its grandeur and consider how long ago it was designed." This suggests the query whether a return from the "gingerbread" architecture of (lie present day to, the simple, massive style of building of a century ago, would not be an improvement. New York, as well as Iio-ton, Is under going a revival of the Sunday laws, the result of a communication luldres-ed to Mayor (iraca by the centnil labor union of New York city. This communication, coming from a large body of laboring men, lias apparently acccomplished what the Christian people of New Yoik have long appealed for in vain. The commis sioners of police have been instructed to enforce the ode prohibiting all manner of public selling or offering for sale of any property on Sunday, with the excep tion of articles of food, which mav lie sold and supplied before 10 o'clock in the morn, ing. Gen. Hntler ha- been worsted in the suit brought against him to recover n bal ance of fl5,H0O alleged to be due Irom him to the National Soldiers' Home, of which lie was for a time treasurer. The judge told the jury Iliac it was a matter of book keeping which they couldn't understand ; that it did not involve any question of Gen. Butler's integrity, and that hesliould instruct them to tiring a verdict for the plaintilV. Gen. Butler will take the case to the United States Supreme Court, upon exceptions reciting that the judge had no right to refuse to permit him to introduce testimony showing that he had accounted for every dollar belonging to the Home that ever came into Ills hands. The "walking delegates," sedentary olllcials and other parasites who subsist upon the laboring classes in this country. are beginning to feel pinched, as cold weather sets in ; and in order to provide these gentlemen ol leisure with roast beef and other luxuries, the executiie com mittee of the Knights of Labor have levied an assessment of 125 cents per member on all local assemblies, ostensibly to Increase the "protection fund" of the organi.'.alion. Wliy the "protection fund" should need an increase of a quarter of a million dol lars at the present time, wiili no strikes wortli speaking of leported, and none likely to take place, is not nppirent : but the ofllcial pocket evidently needs lining. The town of Findlay, O., appear- tube tolerably well provided for by Provi dence. The supply of natural gas in the region iu which the town is situated is such that there isn't a gas meter In the! town. The Inhabitants me us much or a little as they like, paying jl a month for its me for cooking, fl 50 a month for heat ing and at) cents a month for lighting their liou-es. If they don't care to par these charges, all they have got to do is to sink a gas well in their own gardens The well.- in the town produce nil the war from 111000,000 to 13.000.000 cubic feet ol gas daily, and ite cheapness and abund ance have banished all other materials for lighting and heating. In these days of scarcity of wood and high ju ices lor coal, such a prospectus as the above Is decided ly attractive. Among the bills presented to the Legis lature by Mr. Butler of Ksse.v, which lie came laws, was one requiring listers to adinim-ter the oath to taxpayers "with the same formality as oaths are admlnls teied to witnesses in courts of law." This bill was considered by the grand list com- miltee, and oppo-cd by soni's of the mem bers, and finally was reported to the Home at the requestor the cliairnrm without expres-ion of opinion by the committee. When t lie bill was reached it was briellj iliscus-ed and its adoption urged b Messr-. Butler, Newton and others, It then passed ton third rending and a llnal passage without a dissenting vote. This law cannot but prove of distinct valuv, as an aid to thu listers iu procuring truthful and accurate lisls. A number of governors and delegates of States met m Philadelphia one day last week to perfict arrangements for the cele bration of thu lOOtli anniversary ot the adoption of the constitution of thu United States. Hon. John A. Knssou ot Iowa presided and a permanent organization was formed with Mr. Kasson as president, and Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and Col. James A. Hoyt of South Carolina as vice-presidents. It Is propo-ed to have on the anniversary an oration and poem in commemoration of the signing of the constitution, a military display, in which the United States shall be invited to lie represented by eacli branch ot its military and naval service, and tho several States and territories and tho District of Colum bia by their militia, and an indiistral pro cession, Further particulars will doubt less bu announced in due time. Thu I'orc, the organ of thu third party, wis that "thcio are open bars in many cities of the State of Veimont selling as freely and as miscellaneously as the butcher, the baker, tho cuiidle.-tick-iiiukcr" Tills is a distinct untruth. There are no open bars in this State selling as Ireilyiind miscellaneously as the butcher and baker. No city can lie named wu liavo but two cities any how in Vermont- wheieany thing like this is the case. The l'ort also says If the law was fai'li fully eufoiced, tho illegal tralllc In In toxicating liquots would be as rare a", smugcllng is now In holder Slates. Smuggling is by no means rare on the1 border. It Is lumost if not quite us com mon a misdemeanor, as violation of the liquor law. How would it. do for the I 'uli:c to inform itself a little about the actual condil Ion of things In tills State befoiu It holds up Vermont as a "hurt id example." We can not see why the present two cent po-t.igu stamp Is not good enough : but it is announced that we are to have a new one In January. Mr. Hiram Atkins professes to have hud personal knowledge iu legard to Mr. Blaine's desires and purposes in the re cent aiiti-Kdmuiiils campaign In this State. If soMr. Blaine must have made more of a conlidaiit of Mr. Atkins tli.m lie did of the leading republicans of Vermont. Thu lirst session ot the present Congress la-ted nearly eight mouths, from Dec. 7, 1MJ5, to Aug. 5, issii. The sicond session will last less than three months, irom D-c. ti, IKsC,, to Mm oh 4. issr. The holidays must come out of this period About. l::,000 bills wete Introduced at the Hi st session, most ot which -till require consideration ; but it is not likely thai, many of them will gel much. Thu chief work ot the session will probably be speechmaklng on tlie labor question and general politics. Their will lie another period of quietude in the Audover trial, until Tue-day, De cember US, which is tlie dato tlxeil for the next hearing. The case will probably proceed in this manner, by Ills and starts, for a long time to come. It may even bt come onu of those perennial ca-es which are known as "docket fixtures." It through such delay the entile Congrega tional ministry of tlie next generation should b.-eomu heretics.it would lie sad Indeed. It will be remembered that an extradi tion t icaty with Japan was suluniited to the Senate before the late adjournment of Congres-. This treaty has been promul gated by the president, and its provisions are now coiicctly known. Among the extraditable oll'enccs, in addition to the more usual ones, are counterfeiting, forg ery, embezzlement and the malicious de stiuction of properly, where the net en dniigcis hum hi lile. It is curious that the United States should have concluded a satisfactory treaty of this sort with Japan, before it lias with Great Britain. The weather predict 'tins of the New York llcnibl have made quite a reputa tion for that journal, and are coming tote consideied more reliable, as thev certain ly are more delintte, than tlie bulletins of tho weather bureau. It is rather encour aging, therefore, to find the weather man of the New York UcritUl of the opinion that tlie present early and severe cold wave is "not to be regarded as a sure por tent of an exceptionally bitter winter." His reasons for this belief are drawn from a series of obs rvutious extending over many years, and Ills piediction of a mild winter seems to be about as reliable as it is possible for a guess to be. In the current number of the Xnrtli A iHcnvun llcvicit; "Arthur Richmond," suppost d to bu William Henry Iiurlburt, whoso article on Secretary Bayard prevent ed Mr. Allen Tliorndike Rtce fiom being presented to the Prince of Wales, has a caustic "open letter," of the same sort, addressed to President Cleveland. In this tlie president is reminded of the opportu nity to promote the Interests of his party as well as I is country, which his accession to the presidency offered to him, and is l here relinked for abusing hisopportunity iu the mutter of appointments. The fol lowing i- a specimen paragraph : "in luak ing up your government, thu three most important places were accorded, not mere ly lo one State, but to one faction of your I party In that State ; Lamont, your private j secretary ; .Manning, the "Boss" of your gubernatorial career, now secretary of tlie treasury; and Secretary Whitney of tlie navy. You yourself made a fourth iu tills quadrangular quota of the Cleveland fac tion ol New York, which I have placed in tlie order of their l chit ire importance." Alter reviewing theothcreahinetnppoiiit ments the writer turns to the diplomatic appointments, and once more takes Mr. C evelaud to task for selecting for Minis ter to Kngland, "an ob-eure prorincial lawyer." All this sort of tiling, will now be taken bv the public with a certain dis count, for it will lie understood to ho Mr. Rice' personal slap-back at Mr. Phelps and at the administration which keeps Mr Phelps at London. Senator Sherman's Opinions. Senator John Sherman of Ohio, has re cent ly presented Ids riews upon the finan cial policy which ought to be pursued by the republican party, ami ids opinions are worthy of consideration by ell members of the p irty, no matter whether they agree with him in details or not. Senator Sher m in holds that tlie revenues of tlie gov ernment have become Excessive, and should be reduced. In order that this may be done, lie recommends, iu thu first place, that sugar bu plac i on the free list, thus reducing by f 15,000,000 the gov ernment's present income. He would compensate tho sugar-growing industry of tlie Unired States for the loss of its protective tarilT by (laying bounties on su gar grown iu Louisiana. Senator Sherman also favors reducing tlie tax on tobacco by one-half. Tills is a less radical mens lire that that proposed by Senator D.iwes of Massachusetts, who would have tho tax on tobacco abolished altogether. On tlie other hand, Senator Sherman would Increase to the prohibitory point the tariff on a number of articles, in the manufac ture of which Americans encounter keen foreign competition ; on the ground that by checking the competition the revenue from tills sourco would bo reduced. Senator Sherman also proposes a solu tion tor thu national bank currency pro blem. Ho would havo the tax on circula tion reduced to one-half of one per cent, but would allow thu banks to issue notes upon tlie full face value ot bonds instead of to I lie extent of lint 00 per cent. It U almost iinmcressary to add that Senator j Slii riniin lavors the suspension or repeal i of the Bland silver coinage act. His posi llou on this question is well known None of tlie propositions advocated by Senator Sherman are out of harmony Willi thu policy of protection. They simply indicate such a modification ol that pol icy as he condil ion of the treasury de mauds. All far seeing republicans aro lureed that an elfort must be uiailu to do creaso tho present surplus. Tlio President's! Message is not as fruitful of topics of comment as some luessaues have been, 111 referring to the various department reports the piesident does little mole than lo piesent abstracts of the piincipal polntsandto enfoice the suggestions made nythesecre taries The salient points of the message are tlie picsldciit's lutlmal ions that the action of Canadian olllcials toward our llsliermeli has been sucli as to threaten tlie continuance of friendly relations with our Caiiadl in uclglibors; Ids declaration In favor of reducing the surplus, by re ducing the tni in on the necessaries of life and giving "Ircer entrance to such Im ported articles as by American labor may lie manufactured Into marketable com modities": and his fresh declination In Invor of civil service reform. In regard to the lirsl of the-e points it may be noted that it the negotiations to which Mr. Cleveland alludes as likely to bring the fisheries trouble ton satisfactory conclu sion, include it new reciprocity treaty, thev will suiely fail of accomplishing , their end. The piesident makes tho stir-1 plus to be some thirty live millions morel than Mr .Manning does. Whether "tlie, neces-aiies of life" menu sugar and collee, ' or tobacco and whiskey, Is not stated. In ' rcgaid to civil service leform Mr. Clevu-1 laud talks squarely and well. Thu trouble is that his ails speak louder than his ( words, lie Hunks me people do not tin derstiind the question, hut forgets how much Ips own c.our-e lias tended toconfuse and stanger them. The president's views on t tic silver coinage question, anil on the Indian problem, if not new are altogether commendable. Mode Uiiii'm Literary Memoirs. No book recently issued will attract more attention than the military me moirs of General McClellau, edited by W. C. Prime. Like General Grant's book it is the personal narrative of onu of the I chief actors iu the greatest conflict, in I which I bis nation was ever engaged, It j i" also, like General Grant's book, a com-1 meiiliirv upon the Important alia I r-, I principally military, iu which tlie narra- I tor was engaged. Unlike General Grant's ! book, however, ' is une Ided and egotls- 1 tleal an accoii,. ,iu which the individual, wit li his actions and his opinions, tak-s pneedeiice of the course of history. But j it is a readable book, anil there is an in terest even In its egotistical and opinion ated utterances, for they are tho-e of a man who for a time was tlie most prom inent llgure in the eyes of the nation. This book, liowerer, will not change tlie estimate which Gen. McClellan's country men have plated upon him. It will rather strengthen the verdict, for throughout the volume, Gen McClellan's peculiar sell consciousiiess, self-sullicieticy, distrust of I others and desire to elevate himself and1 excuse ids short -comings at tlie expense of j Ids lellow-commandprs are prominently , seen. McClellan's extreme egotism crops out In such p issages as the following: I invariably took tlie ground that I was I thoroughly oppo-ed to slavery, regarding it iimi great evil, especially to the whites of the South, lint that in mv opinion no sweeping mea-uiu of eniancinatlon should be carried out, unless accompanied by arrangement- providing for the new f relations between employers and em ployed, carefully guirdiiig'the rights and I interests of both. My own view was that . emancipation should be accomplished.' gradually, and that tlie negroes should be lilted lor it by ceitnin preparatory steps in the way of education, recognition of the rights of family and marriage, prohi bition agaiu-i -filing them without their , own con-ent, tlie freedom of those born after a ceitaiu date, etc. I was always prepared to make it one ot tlie es-ential conditions of peace that shivery should be , abolished within a fixed and reasonable' peilod. Had the arrangements of the terms of peace been Iu mv hands I should I certainly have insisted on tills. ' Of coiir.-e Gen. McClellau had a poor opinion of Jlnlleck. lie says of him : Speaking of Halleck, a day or two be-1 fore lie ai lived from Washington, Stanton cime to caution me against trusting Hal-1 leek, who was, he slid, probably the greatest scounilrel and most barefaced villi.iu In America He said that lie was totally destitute of principle, and that in the Almaden quicksilver case lie had con-' vicieil llaliecK ot nerjury in open court. When 11-illeck arrived he came to can-1 lion me against Stanton, repeating almost pieci-eir tiiesanie wonts t hat Manton hail employed. Of all men whom I have en countered in high po-ition Halleck was, the mo-t honeles-lr stutiid. It was more dllllcult to get mi idea through his head1 than can tie concired. I do not think he i ever had n correct military notion from Dcginuing lo end. Of Gen. McDowell, ho says that he was incompetent and an intriguer, and so dis liked by his troops that it was not safe for him after tlie second Bull Run to vl-it his own camps, for the men had sworn to kill him! Pope and McDowell, lie says, did all they could to ruin the country. Tins is Gen. McClellan's little ollset to the prevailing judgement, which charges to his own jealousy and sluggishness tho fail ure of Pope's campaign. Kven for President Lincoln (Ion. Mc Clellau has not a simile word of kindness or commendation. The most cordial thing lie lias to say for him is: "My re lations with Mr. Lincoln were generally very pleasant, and I seldom had trouble with liim when we could meet face to face. Tlie dilllculty always arose behind my back." Of Secretary Stanton lie writes with extreme bitterness, iuiluuat Ing that the secretary of war was the basest of traitors. He says : From the light that has since been thrown on Stanton's character, I am satis lied that Irom an early date ho was en gaged iu a treasonable conspiracy. When f readied Washington "in IsVm, lie did his best to Ingratiate himself with me. The most di-agreeahlo thing about htm was thu extreme virulence with which lie abused thu president, the administration and the republican parti, lie never spoky of tho president iu any other way than us tltu original gorilla, and often said that Dn Chaillu wits a fool to wandei all llie way to Africa in searcli of what ho could H-i easily have found at Springlluld, III. He often advocated the propriety of my seizing tlie government and taking affairs into my ewn hands. His purpose was to endeavor to climb upon my shouldeis and then throw mo down. Soon after Mr. Stanton became secretary of war it be came clear that, without any reason known to me, our relations had complete ly changed, Instead of using his new position to assist mo lie throw every ob stacle iu mv wav, and dl I all iu his power to oieate dilllcultj and distrust bctweui the president ami uilsolf. Most ot tins, must lie set down as pure invention on the part of Gen. Mct'ieil.in. He can not make intelligent people be lieve that Mr. Stanton abused Mr. Li II- I coin lo lien McClellau, or ever thought I of such a thing as permitting him to make himself dictator. Tho character of these i memoirs may he judged from the above I extracts. It is a book bo bitter, ludis- Inilmito and unjust In Its accusations, V at even tho friends of Gen. McClellau must regict its publication, Tlio State o. Alio I cm In Ireland. The condition of the Irl-li tenantry ma.) not be us liad during Hie winter us was feared. All hough Mr, Pamcll's bill to re duce the rents u certain per cunt during the severe weal her was defeated iu Parlia ment, a plan has been adopted by the tenants which gives them temporary relief from evictions. It was suggested by a Dublin newspapar, IJnllnl IrcUinit, and is a sort of mutual betiellt association among tenants. Whenever a landloid re fused to make such reductions its are voluntarily offered by fair minded mem bars of his class, ills tenants combine to tender a sum dulv propoi tinned to the market value of the products of their holdings. In case tlie sum 'litis tendered Is rcfmul, tho tenants deposit with a trustee, who p.ijs it to the landlord when ever the landlord signifies u readiness to receive it In full discharge of the Judicial leiit.s. Should, however, the landlord fall buck upon ills legal lemedyof eviction, then tlie tlilstee is to apply the funds placed in his bunds to defending the rights of tlie tenants and to securing them from want. This plan was recently put Into operation on thu Ponsonby es tates in Songhal. The landlords retmed to receive the sums offered by the ten mils, and they were deposited with Mr. Lane, M. P. Tlie landlords holding that It was illegal for Mr. Lane to receive tills money, appealed to an ofllcer to seize him while collecting the rents. Thu officer, however, doubting the legality of such a step, submitted the case in the attorney general, who decided that too government could do nothing to prevent the tenants' entrusting their money to Mr. Lane, if. they desired to do so. This decision lias created u good deal of consternation among thu landlords and rejoicing among the tenantry. J lie latter feel that they are no longer so completely at the mercy ot their landlords as they have been hitherto. Although the landlords may evict in cases where Hie slim offered by the tenants is refused, yet they commonly he-itaie to take such a course, as, In case of eviction, thu money deposited with the trustee can be drawn upon as a relief fund, and so tlie the evict ed tenants will not bu entirely without the means of sustaining life. This plan has been endorsed by the Irish National League and is being pro mulgated very rapidly. Meetings arc held iu various parts of the country; popular leaders advise tlie tenants to make their tenders of a fair rate of rental, and when thu landlords refuse tills, one of thu lead ers acts as trustee lor thu tenants. The landlords, alarmed by the spread of tills movement, have petitioned tlie govern ment to break up the meetings and sup dress the League. But in tlie face of the decision of thu attorney gen eral it is dllllcult to sie how that can bu done. Should the hitter's de cision be sustained, it would seem as though tlie Irish tenantry had at last dis covered a peaceful means of resisting the oppiessivu demands of the landlords, fJood .Suggestions. The modillcatlon of extremes of climate by tree planting is an important branch of the subject of forestry, and one which Coiumis,ioner Coleman of the agricultural bureau thinks should receive greater at tention iu this country. He suggests that the government might properly extend its operations by planting trees on a large scale iu several contiguous sictions of the treeless Slates and territories of the West, witli a view to determining tlie effect of forests upon climate. The military resur vations owned by the government in these States and territories aru suggested as a desirable Held of op. ration. Of the lienelll to lie derived from expe rimental stations, Commissioner Column says : "No measure in pending or propo-ed of greater import to tlie agricultural in terests of this country than the bill for tlie establishment of experimental stations in connection with Hie agricultural col leges." He would, however, bestow the $15,000 proposed to be given to each State for this purpose upon one efficient institu tion, instead of distributing it among sev eral. He would also have a central sta tion at Washington to receive and consol idate tlie results obtained at the various stations. Speaking of the spread of pletiro pneu monia among cattle, Commissioner Col umn says that every effort possible under tlie existing laws lias been made to locate and Isolate diseased animals. Witli a dis ease of this character at Chicago, the cat tle industry of thisiountry lias certainli readied a crisis. Tlie re can be no doubt that it will lie soon and w idely dissemin ated unless prompt and effectual action can be instituted for its speedy suppres sion. To thi.-end lie suggests Unit Con gress should be aski d to pa additional legislation to prevent the spread of tlie kcourge. These are all .wise suggestions. Our Worthlohs Navy. There is only one of the government re ports thus far published which might cause n patriotic American uiieasi uess. Tho report of the secretary of the navy is tho same old story, of tho weak ness, dilapidated condition and shameful ly poor equipment of our American navy We have not really not much navy to speak of.Tlie total number of ships in commission is only --. Of these three are iu thu North Atlantic squadron, three iu tlio South At lantic, six in Asiatic waters, seven in the P.tcitlc and three in our Kuropeau squad ron. Be-ides these there are live old ves sels iu surveying or iu tho training squad ron and the new despatch boat, tho Dol phin, Thu people wore encouraged to hope that tlio recent appropriations made bv Congress for this purpose might provide us with a reasonably efficient although small naval equipment. This expectation, Secretary Whitney frankly acknow ledges, has not been realized, Hu confesses that thu experiments which havo been madu thus far under his administration have been failures. And the best he can do Is to express the hope that lliu next series oi experiments will be more successful ! At best, however, it will bo several years before we can pu-sibly arm the uew ships: with serviceable home-made guns. Assuming that the vus-els which have been contracted for aru lluishud on time, it will lie two, and perhaps three, years before they can lie provided with tlie old nuiico which they are designed to carry In tho meantime what protection would thoy bo to our merchant marina or our coast cities t While wo have mi iey enough, however, we can buy ship of war, If needed jand It is to hu rimmi bored that tlio progress or sub n .,ine navigation may soon render all tb c , t y Iron cliuls of the foreign navies, , , i ally useless.
