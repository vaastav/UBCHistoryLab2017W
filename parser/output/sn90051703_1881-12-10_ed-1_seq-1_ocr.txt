The criminal1 court opened promptly at "ten and Dr. McArthur again took the stand. Guiteausaid, "your honor,'1. ; Scoville Keep still please. ' : Guiteau Then 'you state it at once if you don't I will. Scoville then addressed the court and objected to the character of the evi dence which was being given' by the witness, on the ground, that evidence as to any other crimes could not be in troduced, when the prisoner is on trial for this particular offense. Ho desired all such evidence striken out alto gether. Guiteau here broke in excitedly and shouted. "It is purely in the nature of a confessional. McArthur, is not an expert or lawyer, and I object to him telling the jury and American people facts which I told him years ago in re gard to my history. The court ruled that the evidence could be admitted as tending to show the character of the prisoner. Corkhill Did you ever see anything in the prisoner to indicate insanity? Answer No sir, I never did. Guiteau here broke in and proceeded to express his opinion of Dr. McArthur in terms not delicate. Turning to the reporters table he declaimed for some minutes against the scandelous report of his character, and shook his fist at them threateningly. Scoville cross-examined the witness and became very angry and much ex cited at some of his replies. The testimony in chief was not shaken. A. S.. CALDWELL, the Physician who treated Guiteau during his last illness never detected any evidence of mental unsoundness. CEO. A. PLUMER was then called. Guiteau "I owe this man twenty dollars, but it has cost the government two hundred to get him here. 1 think the Presidents attention had better be called to the way you are squandering the government money. (To Corkhill) He might bounce you at once. You will cost the Government two or three hundred thousand dollars at this rate. Scoville desired the oourt to restrain the prisoner, when Guiteau turned to him and said: "You go slow, Cork hill. You are spotted, and as soon as this business is over the President will- remove you." The witness allowed the prisoner to occupy a desk in his law office at Chi cago for some months. He seemed to have a deal of collecting business and went in and out like a business man. Guiteau continually interrupted and finally the witness said to him, "it seems that your close relations with Diety of late, have corrupted your man ners." The prisoner laughed heartily at this sally, and said: "Well, that's not bad for a western man." Did vou ever see anything in his con duct that indicated unsoundness of mind, was the next question. No sir, nothing, lie seemed to be a man of ability, vain and conceited, but on ins card lie liad, "late from New York," and we expected the rest. This convulsed the court. 

STEPHEN ENGLISH, editor and proprietor of the Insurance Tiniei, of iew York, took the stand. Guiteau called out "this man was in the Ludlow street tail, and I got him out for $300." The witness gave the circumstances under which he became acquainted with the prisoner. Witness was in jail under $40,000 bonds, charged with libel. The prison er aeteu as ins attorney. Guiteau frequently interrupted the witness, camng mm a iiar ana perjurer ai one time ne snoutea, "mere isn t an insurance man in New York that does not know what a frand vou are." Witness continued, the prisoner swindled mo out of $300 and also swindled many poor creatures in jail by promising to help them by getting their money and then never raising a linger in their behalf. Guiteau shouted at the witness "Why, I would not spit on you on the street, you old scouldrcl. I' 11 get some insurance man to show you off right.'' ine witness was asked if ho ever de tected any signs of insanity in the nris oner and replied, on. the contrary he was a remarkably clear headed. shrewd lawyer. He completely outwitt ed me. WARREN G. BROWN, : attorney at law in New York, was coun sel ior Mrs. uuiteau in obtaining a di vorce from the prisoner, believed the latter perfectly sane. íiliitin.n "I wont in Vnnnr ilni-VKSll . , w nuvrT., what alj this kind of evidence has got to ao witn tne real issue, wnojired the shot and killed Garfield, the Deity or I. I think it is devilish mean to rake up my character in all its details. The only issue here is who fired that shot, the Deity or I. Just take that home, Corkhill, and think it over till to-morrow morning. I want to know what all this has to do with the question of my sanity or insanity on the 2d of July. As I have told yon before, I had time to go crazy a hundred times at intervals. Recess. I). MCLEAN testified that Guiteau told him he was bound to have some notirietysome how or other. Ha might kill some big man, or imitate Wilkes Booth. At this the prisoner became very vio lent and abusive. District Attorney Where did that conversation occur in which ho stated ho intended to imitate Wilkes Booth. Wittness In my office of course. . I cannot fix the date. Prisoner snarling at witness "No, of course you cannot fix the date. I never said so and 1 never thought so." Witness The moment I beard of the shooting of President Garfield Mr. Scoville, interrupting Wait sir. How long have you been a lawyer. Prisoner "He is no lawyer. He is a pettyfogger. He gets men about New íork.to do all his jury business. Ho has not got brains enough 'to try a case before a jury. Patterson used to do all his jury business. Shaw, used to be around aud set Patterson to try all his jury cases because ho did not have brains enougn to do it ntrnieu. District Attorney How did you re gard him mentally? W ltness l oia oot unnraiucn oi uim mentally at that time. . The prisoner continued to rail at the witness "I have heard of your run ning with women. My wife told me once in Chicago that you went and vis ited her. I am going to show you up, wretch. You are a low dirty, puppy, to come here and lie about me in that way." The court quite severe to the prison erSilence, f Prisoner "He had no right to come here and lie about me, ., That would make anybody mad." Attorney What was his reply to your remark about his being jianged. Witness He said tnatT would be an consideration and ho would get the no toriety anyhow. - Prisoner "I do not care a snap about notoriety." District Attorney In your conversa tion with him did he say anything to you about his being1 borii togeta living. Witness Yes. , He said he was bound to get a living' anyhow. " That the world owed Mm a living and he would get it. . . 

CHARLES HOHLE, a lawyer of New Yorfe city,, was then called and testified to a number of claims which the prisoner had collected for one of his clients, when he declared he would not give ten cents a bushel for all the claims. Tne items collected amounted to $385. ' Prisoner excitedly "Do you claim that I collected those claims? Is that your business, Mr. whatever your name is?" . v, The witness did not notice the inter ruption. . ,. "My client wanted me to see whether or not I could get money for him, con tinued the prisoner. "That was eight years ago. You would not pay a hun dred dollars and I would not deliver them up." The witness was constantly inter rupted by the prisoner declaring his testimony false. The witness consider ed Guiteau a sharp, keen and rational man. Prisoner That wjis eight years ago. It has a great deal to do with this case, hasn't Hi (in ironical tone to the Dis trict attorney.) "You produce those notes," he shouted wildly, "or else get off of that stand a disgraced man. If you come to slobber over mo you must produce those notes or show yourself a liar." (To his sister, Mrs. Scoville, who was endeavoring to restrain him). "You keep quiet and mind your own business, I don't want any more talk from you in this case. "It makes me j mad," he continued violently, "to think the prosecution should attempt to ruin my professional character when they know it is a lie. It is a shame these men, Corkhill and Porter, should slob ber over my character. They have been digging up my professional re cord andthcy have not found anything against me yet, and they can't. I was straight in the law business, and I want the American people to under stand it. If there is anything against me it is that I owe some board bills, and that 1 committed adultery in order to get rid of my wife. Court Stormy, that will do. Prisoner "I have got through now. I have made my final speech on this matter. It is a disgrace for Corkhill being in this radency. The prisontr while ho was delivering this tirade was apparently under the control of violent passion. His conduct towards his sister was such that Sco ville was obliged to make her change seats' with him in order that he miglit be as close as possible to the prisoner, and try to regress his violence in the cross-examination. Question Did you ever have any conversation with the prisoner on the subject of relation? Answer No. "No," echoed the prisoner contemp tuously. "He is a Jew, and a dirty ono at that." The witness said he was not subpoe nied. He came by a telegram from Col. Gorkhill. I had written Judge Porter about what I knew. Scoville why did you write Judge Porter? Witness Because I thought it was right on the part of anyone who knew anything about the case to divulge it. (Applause.) Prisoner, countemptuously "You did not know anything about it, you miserable Jew." Q. Have you expressed the opinion of this man that he ought to be hang ed? A. Not yet. (Laughter.) I came here for the purpose of having justice done him. The next witness was BENJAMIN HARRISON, United States Senator from Indiana. He testified that he had met tho prison er a few times in various parts of the country last year, and talked with him and refused to help him get an office. The witness saw nothing in the pris oner's conduct or conversation that called to his mind any questions about his sanity. ? Prisoner You are a good fellow. Sen ator. I remember you Very well. Court adjourned till Monday. Failures. New York, Dec. 9. Dun, Wiman & Co., report failures for the past seven days at 164, the largest number record ed in any week during the year. Cf theso the South, contributed 52; the Western States, 42; the Eastern States 83, the Middle, 10; the Pacific, C; New York City 12. The important failures in New York City, arc, C. F. Hoberst &Co., shipping and commission; Lunt Bros., and Lunt Lock & Co. Lunt is a Eartner in both of the two latter rms. An Expiation. Brussels, December 9. An explosion occurred in the Cockrill colliery caus ing the death of 60 persons. Washington, Dec. 9. Keiferis devot ing a greater part, of his time to the preparation of a list of commissioners. The work probabtv will not be com pleted until the latter part of next week or week after. It is not oxpected that tho commissioners will be thoroughly organized before holiday. At the Cabinet meeting to-day all the members except Kirkwood and Mac Veagh were present. The session lasted only an hour. -; The question of organizing a better form of government for Alaska, and enforcing its original by the natives was informally discussed. The trouble with cow boys on the Mexican border received attention and it is believed that some action will soon be taken to protect tho frontiers, both of the United States and Mexico from the depredations by this class of marauders. Another subject considered was the establishment of telegraphic communi cation between the United States, Chili and Peru. An american compa ny is making arrangements to that end. This country could be given such a telegraphic enterprise without compromising tho rights of Chili or Peru in their present complicated con dition. Speaker Keifer said to-day that noth ing had yet been done in regard to the commission on chairman ship of the House. The impression privails that he will announce them next week, but there is no authority from him for the statement. It is thought very proba bly, however, that in view of the ack nowledged complications surrounding the Utah case, the speaker will an nounce the commission on elections on Tuesday so that the contest may be taken in hand by that committee with .out delay. George C. . Gorham to-day in the Republican asserts that in an interview with President Arthur this evening the President explicitedly denied having exposed the cause of Lewis for elec tion to tho United States Senate from Virginia in preference to Riddleberger. The statement that he has done so was made publicly by the friends of Lewis in this city some of whom claimed they he heard the President say that ho thought a Republican should be elected and that Lewis had better claims than others as the Republican Senator. In speaking of the Virginia Senatorial contest to-day he said: I think a Rep ublican ought to be elected, but Riddle berger will get it. Mahone has determined upon Riddleberger and he will be elected. Mahone is one of the most determined lighters I ever saw. He didn't want us give up the fight in the extra session over Lynchburg for the Postmastership. He insisted on going right head if it took until December, but was satisfied I think. Senator Beck will next Tuesday call up his resolution to instruct the Judici ary Commissioners to examine the pro visions of the Constitution and laws of Congress relating to the death, resig nation or inability of the Preisdent, and report as to whether any further legis lation is necessary, and will then make a speeeeh on the subject. Senator Edmunds says he sees no reason why this Congress should not get inrougn witn mis business and ad journ by the 15th of May. Senatorial Question In Virginia. Washington, December 9. The Re publican puplishes the following: Office of the National Republican, Washinton, December 9 Dear General, I had a con versation with the President this even ing in relation to the statement in to day's Post and Mar, of this city, attri buting to him certan views on the sen atorial question in Virginia. In. those statements he is represented as express ing a wish for the defeat of Riddleber ger. I learn from him that it is wholly destitute of foundation. He was told it had been so stated, and that he was taking part in the matter in behalf of Riddleberger. He merely states that he has not interfered at all. He sug gested that Lewis had a friendly talk with him on the subject. The President expressed no desire as to the. political antecedents of the man who should Jje elected, nor did he say one word which, correctly stated, would in the slightest degree embarrass, or call in question your course. On the contrary, he do sires it understood that he has no views, which, in any manner, will conflict with the friendly sentiments hitherto expressed to you. Yours very truly, Geo. C. Gorham, for Hon. W. Mahone. Blaine's. Lanzar ge JW odlGed. . Washington, Dec. 8. It is reported that the President's message with refer ence to tho South American Question. does not read at all like the manuscript furnished by Blaine, as his views of the Department on the subject. It is the habit of the heads of the deparments to furnish the executive facts bearing upon their branch of the service, for the President's resume of the State of the Union, and the consequent recom mendations. It is understood that Blaine, in transmitting the State Depart ment recommeudations, had incorpor ated language altogether too vigorous for discrection, in regard to Chili and Peru. The President quietly told his own views of the proprietness of the situation and modified the language to a more calm cxpressisn, as observed in the message. Hunt t Remain In the Cabinet. . Washington, Dec. 9. There is a re port that Hunt will remain in the Cabi net. One of Hunts closest friends says the talk of the President to Hunt has been of a character to retain him. Hunt expects to remain. He said this morning that the talk that he will cot Bancroft Davis' place in the court of claims is untrue, as he would not accept it. He was offered the circuit judge ship made vacant by the appointment of Woods to the Supreme bench by Garfield, before the latter was shot and would not take it. The present in dications are that Hunt will remain in the Cabinet for a few months. The Fated Train. St. Louis, Dec. 9. The ill fated train which, went through tho St. Charles bridge, over tho Missouri river last k ! . í .1. XT . n a i i f i . uigui, w iut xnu. in easi nounu ireignt. By schedule it crosses just before the Warren accommodation meeting the latter at Brotherton and passing. Tho engine and tender, thirteen cars loaded with live stock and eighteen with other freight and the caboose went down. Three of the six men on the train when it started over the bridge accompanied on that wild leaf of fifty feet into the river channel. That two of them escaped to tell of the awful experience . seems a miracle. One only is missing, Jack Kirkslcy, the engineer, who stuck to his post. Baratas of th Ktaff Theatre. Vienna, Dec. 8. The Ring Theatre, formerly the Comic Opera House, where Sarah Bernhardt recently per formed, took fire at seven o'clock to night. The fire was caused by the full of a lamp on the stage. The house was tolerably full and the loss of life is reat Up to the present time seventy odies have been recovered. Many per sons were iniured. Sixty were saved ! by means of ladders, and by jumping I into cloths held beloW. A great effort was ruado to save lives. The scene was terrible, the flames shooting through the roof and gutting the entire building. It is probable the death list will be fully four hundred. At one o'clock it was discovered that the death roll was much larger than at first named. By two o'clock 240 bodies had been taken out. It is thought that a hundred moro aro still among the ruins. The reports up to two olock were of the gallery where ninety corpses were found in one mass. The fourth gallery had not yet been reached.
