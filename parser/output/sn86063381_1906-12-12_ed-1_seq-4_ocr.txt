SEVERELY ARRAIGNS MORMON CHURCH FOSTERS CRIME, DEGRADES WO- MANHOOD AND IS HOSTILE TO OUR GOVERNMENT. Washington, Dec 12At the con clusion of the morning business in the senate Senator Burrows, chairman of the senate committee on piivileges and elections, called up the resolution from that committee declaring that Reed Smoot is not entitled to a seat as senator of the United States from Utah and addressed the senate on that subject. Senator Bmiows said there had been no pi oof submitted to sustain the al legation that Mr. Smoot is a poljg amist, adding that the lecommenda tion of the committee on piivileges and elections in favor of declaring vacant the seat of the Utah senator is not based on such charge. Mr Burrows' anaignment was based entirely upon the connection of Mr. Smoot with the governing body of the Mormon church, consisting of the presidency and the twelve apostles. He leferred to this body as a "hiei archy" and said that it dominates the state of Utah, holding practically every official position in the state gov ernment. He cited many instances of political interference, not only Utah but ad joining states, and quoted at length the church manifesto of 1896 requir ing members to obtain the consent of the hieiaichy before becoming candi dates for office Smoot was nom inated by the hierarchy, said Mr Bur rows, and the selection ratified by the legislature He went on "No more cunningly devised scheme could pos sibly be concocted to put the church in politicf and make it potential there in than this Member of Governing Body. He said that Mr. Smoot's member ship In the church governing body, which inculcates a belief in polygamy, is conceded. "The evidence is so complete and overwhelming," he said, "as to leave no doubt as to the truth of the allega tion that members of the hieiarchy practice polygamy and are today open ly and confessedly defying the laws of the land prohibiting such crimes The record is so shocking as to challenge credulity." He went on: "Plural marriages are performed in secret in darkened rooms and on the highways remote from habitation Coining to the connection of Senator Smoot with the hierarchy Mr. Burrows said: "The vital question, therefore, is. Can one become a member of and identify himself with a band of law breakers and yet escape all response bility for their unlawful acts' Such a contention will not stand the test of either law or reason." Senator Bur rows concluded as follows: "An organization that fosters and encourages crime, desecrates the home degrades womanhood de bauches public morals registers an oath of hostility to the American na- tionI submit that such an organiza tion Is not entitled to have its repre sentative in the senate of the United States."

On the rock no shelter could be found except a wind break, made up of brush. The survivors were without food until Sunday, when a bag of flour was washed ashore from the wreck. The lighthouse keeper made an unsuccessful attempt to reach the rock. Jakes was drowned while at tempting to enter the yawl from the steamer Fifteen feet of the steam er's bow is now out of water and Captain Robertson fears that the cargo of 1,400 tons of flour and wheat may be a total loss.

COUNTRY IN PROSPEROUS CONDITION FAVORS FULL CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE BUT NOT COMPLETE SELF-GOVERNMENT. Washington, Dec. 12.President Roosevelt has sent a special message to congress treating exclusively of Porto Rican affairs. In opening he speaks highly of the beauty and fertil ity of the island, as noted in his recent visit, and tells of the great progress made under its present admirable government. In the matter of educa tion, he declares, the work of the in sular government is particularly note worthy. After praising the excellent character of the insular police and of the Porto Rican regiment, all of whom are natives, he continues: "In traversing the island even the most cursory survey leaves the beheld holder struck with the evident rapid growth in the culture both of the sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit industry Is also growing. Last year was therency most prosperous year that the island has ever know** before or since the American occupation. The total oi exports and imports of the island was $45,000,000 as against $18,000,000 in 1901. This is the largest in the Isl-J and's history. Prior to the American occupation the greatest trade for any one year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly $23,000,000. Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that there was in the most prosperous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last year, of the value of $14,186,319 $3,555,163 of tobacco and 28,290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of $3,- 481,102. Unfortunately, what used to be Porto Rico's prime cropcoffee has not shared this prosperity. It has never recovered from the disaster ot the hurricane and, moreover, the ben efit of throwing open our market to it has not compensated for the loss in flicted by the closing of the markets to it abroad. I call your attention to the accompanying memorial on this subject by San Juan board of trade, i "There is a matter to which I wish to call your especial attention and that Is the desirability of conferring I full American citizenship upon the I people of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can possibly result from it and it seems to me a matter of right and justice to the people oi Poito Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to be under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path i of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride in what they have done and our {pleasure in extending recognition for ,what has thus been done by granting {them full American citizenship. Opposes Complete Home Rule. "Under the wise administration ot 'the present governor and council marked progress has been made in the difficult matter of granting to the peo i pie of the island the largest measure of self-government that can with I safety be given at the present time. It would have been a very serious mis take to have gone any faster than we I have already gone in this direction. I The Porto Ricans have complete and 'absolute autonomy in all their munic lipal governments, the only power over them possessed by the insular govern ment being that of removing corrupt 'or incompetent municipal officials. It is not a power with which it would be safe, for the sake of the island itself, to dispense at present. The lower house is absolutely elective, while the upper house is appointive. This scheme is working well no injustice1 of any kind results from it and great! benefit to the island and it should cer-' tainly not be changed at this time. The machinery of the elections is ad ministered entirely by the Porto Rican people themselves, the governor and, council keeping only such supervision as is necessary in order to insure an' 'orderly election. Any protest as to 'electoral 'frauds is settled in the i courts. Here again it would not be HAS AN 

JNCOME OF $60,000,000. Rockefeller'! Wealth Increase! $104,- 000 Every Day of the Year. New York, Dec. 12.From an au thority that should be absolute John D. Rockefeller's annual income has been told for the first time authen tically. It will he $60,000,000 when the year 1906 closes. Henry H. Rogers and John D. Arch bold were talking with a prominent financier when the subject came up of how fast the oil king's millions were piling on one another. Said Mr. Rogers: "I know for a fact Mr. Rockefeller's Income this year will be $60,000,000." Mr. Archbold assented. These two men are closer to John D. Rockefel ler's finances than any other two men in the world. Mr. Rockefeller's income every day of the year, therefore, is $164,383.52. Every hour of the twenty-four, waking or sleeping, playing golf or skating, sitting in church or superintending his new house at Pocantico John D. Rockefeller is sure that $6,840.98 is accumulating for him. This is at the rate of $114 a minute. His fortune accumulates at the rate of $1.90 every time the clock ticks. OPPOSED TO HURRIED ACTION. Senate Committee Not Likely to Re port Currency Bill. Washington, Dec. 12.Currency legislation at the present session of congress is unlikely if a discussion in the senate committee on finance may be taken as an indication. The committee spent considerable time in talking of the necessity of cur legislation, but did not have before it any of the several bills which have been advocated for pas sage at this session. The sentiment, it is said, is opposed to the hurried passage of a bill such as might result if a measure were pressed at a short session of congress. TWO 

NOMINATIONS HELD UP SENATE INSISTS ON LEARNING WHEN SHAW AND HITCHCOCK INTEND TO RETIRE. Washington, Dec. 12.Before the senate confirms the nominations of George B. Cortelyou to be secretary of the treasury and James R. Garfield to be secretary of the interior the sen ate committee on finance will insist upon learning from President Roose velt when Secretaries Shaw and Hitch cock intend to retire. The committee has declined to make favorable re ports on these nominations until word shall be received from the president. Failure to act on the nominations does not indicate hostility to Messrs. Cortelyou and Garfield. The opinion was held by all members of the com mittee present that a dangerous prece dent would be established if these nominations were confirmed without a definite understanding as to when the men are to assume office and when they are to vacate the places they now hold in the government service. Political questions, it is declared, did not enter into the discussion in any manner.

In short, the governor and council are co-operating with all of the most en lightened and most patriotic of the) people of Porto Rico in educating the' citizens of the island in the principles of orderly liberty. They are provid ing a government based upon each jcitizen's self-respect and the mutual 'respect of all citizens that is, basted I upon a rigid observance of the prin ciples of justice and honesty. It has not been easy to instill into the minds of people unaccustomed to the exer cise of freedom the two basic prin ciples of our American system the principle that the majority must rule 'and the' principle that the minority has rights which must not be disre garded or trampled upon.

It Is surprising when any one takes the trouble to notice how many letters begin with the pronoun "I." To Ger mans this is egotistical, and their eti quette in letter writing forbids it.

The first thing that a human being should recognize about himself is that his character is his distinguishing fea ture.
