Mr. Sumner briefly supported tbe post Uon takes try the President on the questioner bellig erency, and held that there was so legal way for preventing the departure of the Spanish gunboats.

Mr.Carpenteraaidhedidwcn propo*e that the United States should-ttTher violate the law of nations or shirt ■ manifest duty for for of oou sequences. - Knee lS*i t'nba had been virtually under martial law. To remedy this oppression, the people resorted to revomuon. They had an army, a flag, had fought battles, and were carry ing on a regular wanara.- Tbe-new Constitution of cobs hhcrates -ah staves, and thia was another reason why our own free republic should sympathize effectively with a people straggling » found a like govern ment. Congress had already decided the policy of tbe country to be thatt* neutrality. Toe true policy of oeutraiily was to pursue such a coarse is would prevent any advantage being taken by oce of toe belligerents over the other. If onr government should declare that Cabs and Spain both might buy gunboats in the United States, and knew that Cuba could not be benefited by such permission, and that Sptln would be, than such permlastoo would be d&faoaest, and would add insult to Injury. Tbe American Government should now libel these gunboats on the ground that they had been fitted onr by a foreign power for service against revo lutionary subjects of that power. By that course, an opportunity would be afforded tbe friends and representative* of the Republic of Cabs to produce the necessary information and prove the saiertloni oi the condition of affairs in that Island. The speaker referred to the presence of the Spanish war ves sel, Plxarro, in the harbor of New York, which bad brought officers and men to man the Spanish gunboats, and to escort them to Cuba, and also mentioned the case of the Hornet, which was seized at sea hy tbe United States authorities, taken into an American port, and libelled, if Cu ba violated our neutrality law by fitting out in this country vessels for service against Spain, so, then, was Spain equally guilty tn fitting her ves sels for service against Cuba. Mr. SUMNER contended that either the Sena tor from Wisconsin, or the sdmtnls'nrion and himself had misapprehended the *tat3te<i. The Senator's potmen was, that, under the "la'me on the subject, Spain could not purchase ships la tbe United States to enuse against her revolted sub jects; bet tbe language of thestatots. bethought, was entirely Inapplicable to the cafe. The statete had been amended lor a specific purpose, and it w:u only through that amendment, which further extended the law. it was claimed that tbe budd ing of there vessels was prohibited by a'atnte. Tbe statute In question prohibits oncer certain pccaltiea any person from fltuog out or arming any a hip or vessel with the tntcut that said ship or veuel shall be employed in tbe n*rvtw of any foreign Prlocc or State, or of any colony, district or people, to cruise or commit hostilities against the subjects or property of spy foreign Prince, or of any colony, district or peo ple with whom the rUnitcd States are at peace, etc. The words 4 * of any colony, pnucc, or people,*’ were introduced in the act subsequently, and were intended solely to meet the case of the revolted Spanish colonies, la regard to which there was no question whatever as to their belligerency. The practical Question here was whether those words, introduced for a specific purpose, could be extended so as to apply to in surgents who bsd not yet achieved a corporate (existence, and who had no prize courts. We should seek the truth trom the acts as they are found to exist. Hr. CARPENTER inquired whether tho most favorable opportunity of ascertaining the truth waa not through the medium of libelling the gun boats. Hr. SUMNER replied that the better way, in his oplDloo, of ascertaining the facts was to aend to cob*; to our authorized agents, and direct them to report on the facta, lie understood that re- E ms from these sources bad been sent by the epartment of State to the Senate, and that they were explicit on the point that the insurrection had not yet reached that condition ot maturity which, to point or fset, made It belligerent In char acter. Hr. HOWARD expressed a desire to brar from me Senator from Hassachasetts aoy information In his possession concerning the amount of mili tary force actually in the Held in Cuba. or the amount available. Hr. SUUNEE said the Inquiry wu in some de gree a confession that the senate was in tho dark in this matter, and needed information which should be produced before taking detinue action m the premises. He understood that oo me side of me insurgents, the force baa been greatly diminished, and he had been told they were little more than guerilla.", and that the war waa but lit tle more than a guerilla contest. Hr. HOWARD. Ilave they say government • Hr. SUMNER. 1 understand that thev have a government—that is. a camp. The Senator knows what that It u, bat tats suggests again me neces sity of reliable information. Hr. HOWARD. I desire to know whether they are actually exercising any Initiative functions ? Hr. BUHNER. 1 mink they Dave no legislative authorities, and I most confess I await with much anxiety their action on the subject of slavery itself. There have been reports that there has been a decree abolishing slavery, which was issued for foreign consumption. I state that as a report. 1 do not pretend to vonco form Hr. Somner added that before taking any dec lure step tn the way of recognition me United States Government should be miortncd of me ex act footing of me Cntians concerning slavery. He also looked for assurance irom Spain. Why did not Spain abolish slavery In Cabs? She ought to do lu Mr. MORTON inquired whether Bpiln had not recently affirmed the ers’ence of slavery in her possessions, especially m Porto idea 7 Mr. SDMN’KK replied be was not prepared to In form tbe Senator on that paint, but if bis voice could reach her, be would plead with Spam to move quickly In abolition of slavery where it coold be done a«ay with. Referring to the case of the Hornet, wbtcb vessel was captured by tbe United States, be said it was very dissimi lar from that ot the Spanish gunboats. A tmuor might levy war against the King, bat tbe King In proceeding against the traitor aid not levy war, but simply proceeded lu exercises bla proper function to esmbltsh blazon thorny tu the spirt; of that UiastraUon.be was disposed to believe that the United State was perfectly justifiable under tbe statute In arrest mg tbe Heraet, but would not be justifiable in ar resting the Spanish gunboat. Mr. CARPENTER inquired whether the condi tlon of neutrality did not necessarily depend npou tbe fact that war was progressing between two parties. If It be a violation of our Neutrality act to interfere in behalf ef one of these parties, and fit out rosveis for them in tbe United States, was itcot equally a violation to help tbe other, or wvs our pretence of neutrality a sham 7 Mr. SUMNER replied that be did not regard It as a question of neutrality until tbe belligerence ot there people was recognized. They were not of tbemielves a power nor a people, therefore there could be lo neutrality on the part of our goverrmeat, between Spain and her re volted subjects.

Mr. MURUI LL moved an amendment by repell ing the termer act which declares eight boons day’s labor. Mr. MORRILL read a long speech in which te conieadeo mat the eight- hour law, which applied only to those in the employ of the general govern meat, la anu-Bepabtican and offensive to ail outer Übonug men: teat such a liv universally appliwd would be inconsistent with tho beat intern-*lB of the American worklrgmen; that U will not afford any leisure which anil be made available lor* mental or moral improvement; that It ts untrue that mankind will or can perform as much labor, and of equal value m eight honr* as in ten or more: that the measure, if adopted nor by our whole country, would prove an immeasurable national disaster: that there are other means whereby labor has been, and can be, much more efficiently encour aged and protected.

SmKOFXXLD, HL, Dee. IS. A MOTS FOSWABD. Daylight at last dawns, and we now hare a fair prospect for a permanent organization. Aa I pre dated, the debate on the oath question lasted on tn the very last moment of the afternoon session. Thelstltode of the debate to-day was very wide, and tbe news on both sdes were expressed is a very able Benner, bot, in a large number of in stances, the remarks to-day were bat a repetition of those of yesterday. Judge Bktoner was ex exceedingly voluminous, and signed Uxe a thorough-bred and technical lawyer. Very few who are not of the tame profession will follow him in his Dne-emisttU and batr-sphttieg propo sitions. Mr. Turner, of Freeport, also discussed the question eloquently sad aoly on the Republican side of the boose. Tbe speech of the day was marie by Mr. Church, of Henry. Be was subjected to a While cross-fire by the Democratic members, and generally answered all questions in a satisfac tory manner. Bis view of the question blended the technicalities of a lawyer and broad contpre benstTeneea of the statesman. Bis speech was also the last one of the day, and Mr. Browning's substitute came to a vote, and (was carried by a majority of four. Everybody understands this vote to be the test vste of the strength of the parties In the conven tions, and, of course, lu announcement wu awaited with a good deal of Interett. Whenever the name of a Cook County delegate was called there was breathless silence to bear the answer. As his speech Indicated, Bathes, of Lake, voted in the negative: so did MedtQ ahd Anthony. AU the others voted for the substitute. Thus is dis posed off at once two vexed questions—the oath of office and the question of eligibility. rSEMANZKT ORGANIZATION. To-morrow the convention will go Into aa election for officers and proceed at once to a perma nent organization. It (• not anticipated that any thing more will be heard of the Ineligibility matter, or that any farther objections will be Interposed lo Judge* Bryan and Rice taking thetr a eats. At least this is the aspect of affairs at present. In fact, tn the absence of all contestants to the seats of these gentlemen, there lx 00 recognized way m which the matter can be brought up. Neece, the last remaining Democratic absentee, la expected to arrive to-night at least eo his friends are Informed. This will give the Democrats one more working member and the Independent can didate another vote. THE CANDIDATES, So far as the candidates are concerned, they re main as I last informed you. There is no earthly doubt but that Hitchcock wvl be elected, at everything points that more strongly than at my previous despatch. So far as the bal ance of the ticket is concerned, there Is bat.little intereit man (rested. Of ceorae, there will be con siderable excitement as to the appointment of committees, bat tt U apprehended that this doty TUI be discharged in a very impartial manner, and without any particular regard to party; at least the convention talk this way. Once permanently organized, and It la to be hoped mat the partisan strife which has disgraced the opening days of me convention will be no more seen. One thing that will tend to this end will be the disappearance of the hungry crowd of place seekers who are now boring their members to work in their behalf. These disposed of, and once brought face to face with their grave respon sibilities, delegates wtu undoubtedly rise to me height of their solemn datiaa. The debate of me last few days has developed the fact tha t mere la more talent tn the conven tion than has ever been claimed for it, and if par- Uzanshlp is dropped me people of the State may have cause to congratulate themselves that me great work of altering and amending their coa ■mutlon has fallen into most competent hands. THE CONVENTION. SratxortELD, Rl. t Dee. 15. The convention was called to order at 10 o’clock, by the temporary Chairman, and prayer was offered by Rev. Hr. Robinson. TUB OATH QUBITOK. The reading of me Journal being completed, Ur. CUMMINGS, of Fulton, said that In regard to the question under debate be supposed that every m«w wished to get upon the record. Probably this was an important object, but he imagined thatthepeople understood me subject tolerably well. He exhorted me members to go to work like men and do me work their constituents ex pected of mem. The people were not so anxious to hear tweet voices as we might imagine. Hr. BATNE, of Woodford, moaght It was about time for the agricultural Interests to be heard. If mis whole question was left to me town of Caze- Boris, ib hla county, tt would be decided in ten minute*. There is a contract between me people ot mis State and the delegates here, whereby we get six dollars for doing certain work. I want my money, and I do no: expect to get it unless I take the oath prescribed. I have never read Black stone, but 1 bare studied law from me book of na ture, and can form my «wu opinion of this ques tion In ten minutes. Mr. ANTHONY, of Cook, offered a resolution that tbe convention proceed to drew permanent ■eats. Tbe scats were then distributed bylou Eligible seats were given to Messrs. Kirk patrick, sad Emerson, on account of physical in- Urmiuea. TUB btSCCSSIOK. The dircutsion was resumed. Mr. CARY, of Jo Daviess. I did not propose to isy anything cn this question at all, but since tbe discussion has been going os 1 have Become satisfied that this Is one of tbe most important questions that will come op before this tody during tbe present session. This is not a revotntlonary body, and tbe convention is here ny r.rtue of the Constitution ot tbe State of Illinois. ■ If all are here in ibis way. It U eminently necessary tbatwesbonid take an oath to support tbe con stitution. We are not here with absolute author ity. If we are, then the worst thing that tbe people ot this coontrr have to bear is a Constitu tional Convention. We do nothing of ourselves, but only prepare articles for tbe people to ratify or re 

SKINNER, of Adams, said that be at tached lime importance to tbe tables of tbe caib. For one be bad bo objection to fating u, but this was a coantrj la which great liberality was allowed to all things that touched liberty oi conscience. Tbe gemot of onr IniUtoUons was to avoid every appearance of compelling a man's conscience, bat, daring this prolonged debate, several gentlemen baa presumed to say tbat this was a revolntionary tody, Such apresomptionwas ntterly nocalled for. By tbe cosstltotlon of this gOTernment. all tbe people bad tbe inalienable nght to change tbeir form or government, peaceably, R possible, forcibly, tr they must. Tbe rowers of ibig convention were great. There was cotln tee consiitstjon a ciaose to compel tbe submission of tbe new instrument to tbe people. Uiquestlonahly there was full power m tbla body to proclaim tbe new constitution if U should eo choose, bat no one present bad any such de* aigs. certainly be bad not, bm be wished to state the fact when bo znacb was claimed by gentlemen on tbe other side for tbe Legislature. it was au tempted to male tbe legislature almost supreme. When tne General Assembly bad provided tor the assembling of this body, (and tbat aatcmbl'ng was an accomplished event), then all power on tbe part of tbe Legislature ceases—drops oat of Mg&t. it baa so more to do with ns than a town meeting. We hohl ibai sovereign power is with tbe people, by whom we are aent here. To bold otherwise would be to tbat tbe Gen era! Assembly is our master, as baa already been mentioned by tbe gentleman from Coot. It bis been assumed that delegates here are offleera in tne sense of tne con futation. An officer is a mere fiction of wards. An office is a position or condition provided by law to the execution of tbe powers of government, and la cotmrgenu It isnet in motion by law, and ceases by tbe mm operation. Under our system of government, an incumbent of office has a cer tain period of tune to exercise bis duties. Qe bos a predecessor and a successor. There are also pnmtiona rorbiadeatn, bis reMgnaoon. bis moral, or sickness. There are also fanner dis tinct! os* between the Uanuiues of an officer and or those wbo merely exercise functions. Now this body Is here as a temporary body, for one, two, or three months, and it has no successor. Ho cited antbonuea -to snow tbat the Governor ebonld appoint certain officers; that others should be selected tn other ways, bat that the General Assembly should not elect any offi cers whatever. He argued tbat tbe oatb of office, as prescribed, was only to be ta&en by tbe officers order tbe government. _ Hr. 

CLARE, of Logan, asked Hr. Skinner, as a lawyer and a Judge, whether be thought that un der that clause in the constitution relating to the judiciary, and excluding Judges of the Supremo and Circait Courts from holding office during the time they alt as such, and for one year thereafter, such officers elected to this convention as dele gates, could MU Mr. SKINNER replied in tbe affirmative. After smother interruption from the aame quarter, he stated that be now discovered the object of this lengthened debate, which was to exclude dele gates bv their oatb. He said if delegates were excluded from here, then totno or the people would be without representation tn this body. This would be a monstrous injustice. He proceed ed then at length tn support of bis position, and gave way to a motion to adjourn. Ur. T. J. TURNER, of Stephenson, said tbe only reason why the Legislature was supreme during its existence was that the people had delegated to It certain fixed powers. Now, wha; was oortrela tionto tbe Legislature when tbe people formed thetr government. They reserved to themselves certain tight*, and these had new been surren dered. It was In the exercise of these reserved rights that this convention met. It was in the ex t rclfe of toes** reserved right* which were refused to tbe Legislature, hut are reiervod etpectalty to convention! Ute tht*. Tbe people granted tbese rlghta to no other recognized body. They were jealously guarded, and delegated only to specially called bodies—bodies ceiled only upon the espe cial motion of the people. Which body. then, bad the greater power? He contended that the peo ple bad precluded the Legislature from presenb- Irg qualification! for members of that body; and was not an oath a qualification? If one oatb might be prescribed, why sot any other oath, a property condition, or a religious test ? We were superior to tbe Legislature. Both derived their i oven tium tbe tame source, but tbe Legislature ww* limited by the constitution of the sure, and the convention u noL We may prescribe qualm retlrm for members of tbe Legislature, as eo one would deny. Is R possible, then, tbat the Legit imize can prescribe ours ? Tbe speaker agreed, however, wttb the gentleman, that this was not yet a legally organized body. He would take ta* oatbonezedby Hr. Browning, but not an oath bUndly to support an tnstrumeut he was engaged in taking to pieces. The last delegation of power from the people was to this body. Considerable cross-questioning followed Hr. Turucr’a speech. A delegate asked bow long tbe present constitution would remain in fora. Mr. 

TURNER. Unto the new one shall bare been pot to rote and adopted by tbe people. Anotber delegate inquired if, upon inspecting the conattttUon. he aboutd find that it needed no unendineot, then would the oatb bare been moon attest a ith his daika. «X,TCVSS4;ut (Mon mtaWi CHICAGO; THURSDAY.

All tbe argnznenta of the opposition had net yet shown him that there was aty palpable difference between h» amendment and roe oath originally proposed. But he went further.

The gentleman, together with assy others, his taken an oath as aa attor ney-at-law to support the Constitution or the State, Doea he consider that oath interferes with his dntles here ? Mr. AI.LK.V. That question I*' answered very easily. I may take as oath for one panose and lor another; 1 consider that I will stultify myself in taking an oath ro support this present constitu tion,’when I am about to help to pull it to pieces, 1 atatM when l offered Uus amendment that I am noLhcoeve the Legislature had the power to pre sort* the oath which this convention shall taco I bettftve it yet -I also believe that I have acoom plahed tome pood in haring attention drawn to the power of the legislature under the constl lottos. 1 think same pi us hare better ideas upon this subject now than when we came here.

A delegate asked if, in amending the eon* tUtntJon and sabmitCsg It to the people, they were violating tne commotion. Mr. atjjts. WeD, sir, that depends on what Is meant by the term vlolatinr. lam certain that to amending, altering; or per&sps in obliterating altogether a clause m that instrument. 1 am not engaged a maintaining and perpetuating It. Moreover, in prescribing this oath, the Legislature bad excluded from the convention all that class of perrons whose conscience* would not allow them to swear with uplifted hand. Mr. 

MEDILL, sf Coot county, said that the de bate was premature. All had been proceeding upon a lilse assumption. No one jet bad proved his right to a seat. This was not yet a legal body, only xnembers-eiectof a convention. The conven tion could not measure anna with the Legislature till it is organised, bos was of no more force than a town meeting. As to the taking of the oath, only a revolutionary convention, or a military body, could refuse; but, under the pres ent circumstances, we could do nothing, and need not take the oath until organised, it was a opes* lion not properly before the body, and could not come up until theeouveooon had elected Its on cers and was a recagtdzed body. Mr. BENJAMIN, of McLean, - merely arose to make a few suggestions. The constitution was the mndsmestal and organic law lor this conven tion even ante after 11 adjourned. We did meet here to organise a provisional government, but to act in accordance with an established govern ment.

Private property is sacred from the debt of a municipal corporation. It is tbe ssne os a creditor saving if he cannot collect what A owe* him be will collect from B, his neighbor. Tbe bondholder* took tbe worthless bonds from county and city in tbetr #wa tnuk and now demand ihai individual tax-payer* shall pay it. Let them take the property of the county. Wb*t if that property is exempt from execution? The bond Solders should have thought of that when they took tbe bonds. Tbe great mass who pay taxes now are not re sponabJe for tbe bonds.

The attendance was good this morning. Dr. Bolt said that tbe Elernge Metarlae was the only one of value. Tbe BeLe tie Cbassey la said to abed Its leaves too early, and la otherwise ten der. Tbe Doctor stated that the Dart cherry sc the South depended on a continuous growth through the season^ Mr. weir stated he would grow as many bushels of sweet cherries to tbs acre as ot the Early Rich- Bond or May cherry—tbe soil/loe**. If Mr. Weir can do thts, a bis success is assured, and be should turn bis attention to cherry growing. Among tbe early sweet cherries tbe Elton Is very early and is hardy, but tbe whole family do so poorly tost suc cess has net well assured the oldest plant er!, inch as Sbenperd, Brymant, Dairy, Woodard, Edwards, and Mortfeld. Mr. Ragan, Secretary of the Indiana State Hor ticultural Society, stated that all the sweet cher ries bad failed In hts State, and that, the-hat bad been reduced to what is known with tnem as the Early May and at other points as the Early Rich mond, and this is the best grafted on Marello stocks. To the question. What to do with the suckers 7be said give them to your neighbors to graft, and you will find them no great incon venience. Mr. Dogtrolu stated tbit In Macoupin County they could grow sweet cherries, but they were uot profitable. . Dr. 801 l said, on tbe low sou of tbe banks of tbe Mississippi the Gredley and others pay a fair profit. Mr. Fouler, of lowa, said that the Early May was their only cherry, and that some persons make wine or this fruit. air. Plctsjc, of Or.irgo, stated that tbe trees of tbe Barty May bore suffered from a grub or borer that destroys them, and tbe fruit suffers from tbe rot. Tbe season baa been very ramy. Mr. Riley sal a tbe cberry tree borer la peculiar to that tree, agd tbe remedy is an application of soft leap, ue said that the rot In tbe cberrv is not one to tbe curcuiio, but to some other cause. This brought up Dr. Bull.wbo instated that tbe rot is otteo doe to the atiog of tbe cotcallo, and at other times to so excess or wet. - Tbe English Marello was called op. Mr. Oalnstaa gpote bignly of it aa a late cberry for canning. Mr. Nelson, of Will County, called attention to tbe Kentish, a cherry ripening two weets later than tbe Early May. Dr. Hull read a paper 00 tbe codling moth ap ple worm. This inaect lay* Its eggs m tbe calyx of the young apple. At first they are too small to be seen with tbe nakc-* ~re, but soon work to the centre cf tbe style. and rum tbe fruit, which fail* before ripe, later In the season. Tbe fruit ripen* with the worn* in U. These are earned to the store-rooms, where they undergo the second stage, and emerge to repeat the mischief. The remedy is to scrape off the rough bant, to spoil tbatr hiding place, *Ragt la the branches of the tree will trap large nnmotrs. A fire at night will attract them by its light, and destroy nearly the who.c brood. A lamp set in oil or water is the most convenient. The rags should be looked after once in ten or twelve day*. Ur. Riley (dated that he did not believe that the codling moth was attracted by tight, and, there fore, bad no faith in that remedy. He would ose tbe rag m preference to tbe bay beads. He would take the rags to tbe borne and scald them, and re turn tbe re gto tbe trees. He farther stated hi* want of -faith in springing the trees with any liquid whatever. Tbe bird* desnoy large numbers of the cocoons of this insect, and there was so doubt that the broods come mainly from the cellars and oM apple barrels. One of tbe modes is to destroy all the wlndfal'a by picking them op dally and feed- log to tbe pigs. Dr. Hull scrapes his tree* early in summer, and applies a coating ol sod soap, applied while not, with a paiht-brusb. mESICEVT'S
