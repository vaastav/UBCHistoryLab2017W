Glynde and Hllgay, whose friend ship puU that of David and Jonathan to the right about, were fated to be pitted against each other lu every thing. They cemented their friendship by blacking each other's eyes when Glynde was nine and Hllgay ten. They both played cricket. Hllgay'8 most brilliant Innings for Cambridge were stopped at 99 by a magnificent tatch by Glynde, of the Oxford eleven. Naturally enough. It came to pass that Glynde and Hllgay fell in love with the same girl. At least, that Is only my way of putting it. Glynde and Hllgay would tell you, if they liked you well enough to discuss the matter with you, that they were in love with the only girl la the world. Men In love are never accurate. There was, to both of them, a touch of tragedy about this last coincidence. They were dining in town together on an off evening .to see the "Man of Many Collars," at the Alhambra after, wards. With something of blatancy Hllgay had said, "Jack, I'm in love." Jack Glynde put down his cigar and turned very pale. "I don't bellevo you. It's It's ab surd." "Absurd? Good heavens, why?" said Hllgay. "Because I am, too, and we're dead certain to be in love with the eame girl." A little chilled silence fell upon the two men. For a moment thoy sat looking at each ether, superstitious horror In the eyes of both. Neither dared to ask what was her name. Glynde waited for Hllgay to give the name and Hllgay for Glynde. At last they made a simultaneous move ment. Their theatre .tickets were In their pockets, but, with that tacit understanding which can only exist botween bosom friends, they turned away from the Alhambra and made for the Embankment. Each felt that air was a necessity. The Embank ment is the only place in London where it can bo found. For an hour, arm-in-arm, they paced the flagstones. Sometimes Glynde's hand would close hard on Hllgay's arm, as though to say, "Whatever fcappons, old man, nothing matters," and sometimes Hllgay would squeeze Glynde's hand tight against his ribs, and Glynde knew that he was saying, "Whoever she is, bid man, we are pals to the end." It Is well said that the love of one man tor another passes the love of woman. These two never really knew what their friendship meant until the Woman came Into .their lives. With a sudden Inspiration Hllgay took out half-a-crown. j "Heads br tails, Jack?" he said. ; "Heads!" said Jack. Teirl A T TI1 . 4cuuj xiuKaT uncnvnrnd t tells. " "You must tell me her name, old man," he said. Glynde cleared his throat, took Hllgay's arm, and started walking away from the Embankment at four miles an hour towards the Ox ford and Cambridge Club. On the steps of the club Glynde made a mighty effort. "Enid Allerton," he said, and then looked sharply round at Teddy. He aw a wave of blood fly into his face, and felt his arm tremble. "Good Lord!" said Hllgay. ! Why, what's the joke? What's your girl's nam.8?" "Enid Allerton." said Hllgay. Good heavens, isn't the world large enough for us both?" Glynde's face was twitching and his eyes blazed. "What have wo done? What's uKmAtter wl,h U"T 1 What' rng tfae world? Why, la heaven's name, should we always come up Whl" euCh tUer?

"Not a dog's chance against a man like Jack," thought Hllgay. "Look at that nose, those eyes and that hair and the way he tans Is simply Im mense. By gad, too, I never noticed before what awfully decent hands and feet he's got." Thus both men sat, running up a long list of the othsr's qualifications which each considered ho did not pos sess. "Who Is to propose first?" said Glynde abruptly. "Spin a coin," said Hllgay. Glynde laughed. "What? Even in this case?" "Why not? We've always done it hlsoorto." "Very well, old man. And It you win the toss, I wish you all the luck I know you'd wish mo." "Thanks," said Hllgay. They got up. Their healthy faces "To the lady who Is to honor me by being my wife. Her name Is Enid Allerton." Long after Carbls had hurried away, hot and happy, Glynde and Hll gay stood silently looking Into their glasses. The waiter twice came in to clear them away. It was on the stroke of 12, and he was keen on nothing but bed. . They called up two hansoms. "Jack," said Hllgay. . "Hullo," said Qlynda. "This Is the first time you and I are not iiolng to be pitted against each other, attar all." "No, and It's the first game you and I have ever drawn." In Glynde's heart there was a feel ing of great compassion for Hllgay, and In Hllgay's a feeling of great compassion for Glynde, Richmond Times-Dispatch. Ml DANGER- IN" KY SHAMPOOS. Death Sometimes Result of Using Very Volatile Compounds. The dangers of the dry shampoos that have recently come Into vogue are unquestionably not sufficiently recognized. The growing use of same of the light hydrocarbon or other vo latile compounds Is probably fraught with the moat serious consequences, but even tho apparently innocuous shampoo powders have their draw, backs. Carbon tetrachiorid seems to bo used most extensively, and the num ber of fatal accidents which are being recorded makes It incomprehensible that a drug so dangerous should be employed at nil. Its formula, CC14, shows Its near relation to chloroform, and its anaesthetic properties are al most as marked. The vapor given oft la considerably heavier than air and rapidly accumulates around the face when tho liquid is applied to the scalp. Innumerable cases of gemt-eon-sclousness are reported, it is now claimed, by the English hairdressers, but the patrons, women almost exclu sively, do not object, and so the "playing with death" goes on. It Is a frightful commentary on the fatu ity of the day.

COST OF LIVING DISCUSSED Entertaining a Prejudice. m jj Of all the occupations known to men, entertaining a if, prejudice Is the most absurd. Yet the practice Is almost (K universal. 9 The prejudice Is usually uninvited. He comes In quietly, $ removes his hat aud coat, saunters up to the guest chamber, (ft and prepares to become a permanent feature of the estab- fllshment. You entertain him royally, strain him to your bosom, exhibit him proudly to. every one, fight for him, de lft fend him, and perpetuate him. You do not even admit that P he Is pressnt. "I entertain a prejudice?" you say, with be J, coming concern. ''Never!" A Birds of a feather flnck togather. It thareforo happens j that If there Is one prejudice present, there are others. They fa always come In unawares, and take their places silently and unobtru3lve:y. But oh, how they hang together in an argument! ijj A group of prejudices is invincible. They have never j been beaten. !5 The strange part of prejudices Is that one would think A, they would prefer more commodious quarters. But no, the l narrower tho mind, the more content they are. They don't mind c'.o:e quarters. The closer the better. f, Prejudices are always busy. If they are not tampering (ft with one's eyesight, they are screening the mind from the ? open; putting blinds on, and making it dark enough to sleep A? in comfortably. A man can get Insured against almost anything else but T prejudices. He can Insure himself against fire and water j and loss of lifa and accidents and depreciation In his prop- ferty. But iicra Is no company so fortified that it would take the risk of insuring against -prejudice. And then no man 4 would ever think of taking out any insurance against one, be- b cause he would csver admit .that ho had It. The prejudice T himself fixe3 that. The first thing he does Is to make tho $ man think he isn't there. That is why prejudices, no matter Jiow much damage ft they caus3 to character, are never evicted. They have come $ to stay.

They both disliked him Intensely. For all that, he was a very decent chap, play. Ilk tennis wlth the beet of them, and sang songs like an angel with a sense ot humor. "Hallo, you chaps."

President Taft's first annual message to the Congress is, in part, as follows: To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations Of the United States with all iloroigq governments have continued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Pursuant to the provision?, of tho general treaty of arbitration conclud ed between the United States and Great Britain, April 4, 1908, a special agreement was entered into between the two countries on January 27, 1909, for the submission of questions relating to the fisheries on the North Atlantic coast to a tribunal to be formed from members of the perma nent court of arbitration at The Hague. In accordance with the provisions ot the special agreement the printed case of each government was, on Oc tober 4 last, submitted to the other and to the arbitral tribunal at Tho Hague, and the counter case ot the j United States is now In course of I preparation. This, adds, the President, is the first case Involving such great lnter ! national questions which has been i submitted to the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague. The President states that the treaty ! between the United States and Great : Britain for the marking and defining of the boundary line between this country and Canada in the waters of Passamaquoddy Bay makes It neces sary to submit the question to arbi tration. The regulations tor the protection ot food fishes In international bound ary waters of the United States and Canada complied by the commission under the convention ot April 11, 190S, will be duly submitted to Con gress with a view to the enactment of such legislation as will be neces sary under the convention to put them into operation. Negotiations for an International conference to reach an arrangement providing lor the preservation and protection of the fur seals In the North Pacific are in progress satis factorily with the governments of Great Britain, Japan and Russia. The President then devotes a para graph to the second peace conference at The Hague and the question ot an International prize court. He speaks of tho confereuce held in London from December 2, 1908, to February 26, 1909, as having resulted in an eminently satisfactory codification ot the International maritime law. Reference Is then made to the sub ject of reforms in the Congo. The President says the attitude of the United States is ono of benevolent encouragement. Announcement is made that a satis faotory patent convention with Ger many Is now in force and that efforts for the making ot similar treaties with other European governments are cow in progress.. The report of our commissioners who wont on a friendly mission to Liberia has just been completed and Is now under examination by the De partment of State. It Is hoped, re marks the Message, that there may result Borne helpful measures, In which case It may be my duty again to invite your attention to this sub ject. After felicitating Turkey on her quick transition of the government from one of retrograde tendencies to a constitutional government, the Message turns to a discussion ot Latin American affairs, observing that one ot the happiest events In recent pan-American diplomacy was the pacific, independent settlement by the governments of Bolivia and Peru ot a boundary difference be tween them, which for bo ma weeks threatened to cause war, The President continues: The nn-Amerlcan policy of this Government has long been fixed in Its principles and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances ot the United States and of the repub lics to the south of ub, most ot which have gveat natural resources, stable government and progressive Ideals, the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other doctrine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the per petuation of irresponsible govern ment, the escape of Just obligations or the isldlous allegation of dominat ing ambitions on the part ot the Uni ted States. Mr. Taft expresses his pleasure at meeting President Diaz of Mexico, and then remarks that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed oux re latioiiB with Venezuela have been set tled and .provision has beon made for nrbltra'Jon of the remaining cases be fore The Hague tribunal.

A SAtt1r.mf.nt rt tVia IfnnhlaartmB Emery case In Nicaragua was reached by the signature of a nrotornl on Rfn- tember IS, 1909. The claim of Alsop & Co. against Chile has been submitted to the ar bitration ot his Britannio Majesty Edward VII. The Message does not dwell at Creat lencrth nn tho -ntnnl InaHnna caused by the methods of the Zelaya Government of Nicaragua. On this subject It says: At the Oate when this Message Is printed this Government has termi nated dlDlomatln rohltlnna vilth h Zelaya Government for reasons made puunc in a communication to tne former Nlcaraguan Charge d'Af- falres and Is lntPtirllnir tn tuba mnh future steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American interests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may later be neces sary for me to bring this subject to the attention of the Congress In a special message. In the far east wrttaa IK a Tronl. dent, this Government preserves un- cnangea lis policy of supporting the principle of equality of opportunity and scrupulous respect for the Integ rity of the Chinese Empire, to which jjuuuy are pieagea me interested powers of both east and west. When It appeared that Chinese llkin reT enues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project it was obvious that the governments whose nation als held this loan would have a cer tain direct interest in the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms in question. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. China is making admirable efforts toward the eradication ot the opium evil, and Mr. Taft recommends that the manufacture, sale and use of opium and lt,s derivatives In the United States should be so far as possible more vigorously controlled by legislation. Our traditional relations with the Japanese Empire continue cordial, as usual. The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which Is terminable in 1912 is already receiv ing the study of both countries. The Department of State is con sidering also the revision In whole or in part of the existing treaty with Slam. Continuing, the President writes: I earnestly recommend to the fa vorable action of the Congress the estimates submitted by the Depart ment of State and most especially the legislation suggested in the Sec retary of State's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganiza tion of the department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thor oughly efficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American Interests abroad. The Message then turns to the consideration of the subject of rev enues and expenditures, as follows: Perhaps the most Important ques tion presented to this administration is that ot economy In expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows that the ordinary ex penditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the estimated receipts by $34,075, 620. If to this deficit be added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama Canal, amounting to $38,000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on tbe nub ile debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts p id expenditures will bs in creased to a total deficit of 73.075,- 20. This riefirlf tho Sacrrv nm- POSeS to meet by the proceeds of uonas issuca 10 pay we cost ol con structing the Panama Cnnal. I ap prove this proposal. The policy of paying for the con struction ot the Panama Canal not out of current revenue, but by bond Issue, was adopted in the Spooner act of 1902, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the principle by which a part at least of the burden ot the cost of the canal shall fall unon our nnster- tty, who are to enjoy It, and there is an toe more reason for this view because the actual cost to date ot the ra n n 1 which im now hair Anna and which will be completed January l, 1U15, snows mat the cost of engi neering and construction will be $297,786,000 Instead of $139,706. 200. as orlelnallv estlmntprl Tn ad dition to engineering and construc tion, the other expenses, including sanitation and government and the amount paid for the properties, the franchise and the privilege of build ing ine canal, increase the cost by $75,435,000 to a total of $375, 201,000. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year I directed the heads of departments in the prepar ation of their estimates to make them as low as possible consistent with Imperative Governmental necessity. The result lias been, as I am advised by the Secretary of the Treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending Juno 30. 1911 that is, for the next fiscal year -are less by $35, G3,000 than the total of appropria tions for the current fiscal year and less by $94,000,000 than the esti mates for that year. Mr. Taft discusses in great detail his efforts tq reduce the cost of per manent administration. An Investigation ordored by my predecessor, he states, resulted tn the recommendation that tbe Civil Ser vice bo reclassified according to the kind of work, so that tbe work re quiring most application and knowl edge and ability shall receive most compensation. I believe such a change would be fairer to the whole force and would permanently Improve the personnel of the service. The President adds: "I am strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the diffi culties presented by the superannua tion of civil servants can bo found than that of a system ot civil pen sions." I regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds In the collection of the Customs revenue at New York City, In which a number of the subordinate employes in the weighing and other departments were directly concerned and In which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining Company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on underweights ot sugar. The Government has recovered from the American Sugar Refining Com pany all that It Is shown to have been defrauded of. It would seem to me that an investigation of the frauds by Congress at present, pend ing the probing by the Treasury De partment and the Department of Jus tice, as proposed, might be glvina; Immunity and otherwise prove an embarrassment In securing conviction ot the guilty parties. By reason of wbat is known In the recent Tariff bill as the "maximum and minimum" clause, the President says, "fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty Im posed on the executive are likely to lead to a tariff war. I beg to express the hope and belief that no such re sult need be anticipated." Continuing this subject, he re marks: The new tariff law enables me to appoint a new tariff board to assist me in connection with the Depart ment of State in the administration ot the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the Government in the administra tion of tbe entire law. I have therefore appointed a tariff board consisting of three members and have directed them to perform all the duties above described. This work will perhaps take two or three years. Nothing, however, halts business and interferes with the course of prosperity so much as the threatened revision of the tariff, and until the farts are at hand, after careful and deliberate lnvestls-tlon, upon which such revision ca.'. properly be under taken, It seems to me unwise to at tempt It. In the Interest of Immediate econ omy and because of the prospect of a ''flclt I have required a reduction In the estimates of the War Department for the coming fiscal year which brings the total estimates down to an amount forty-five millions less than the corresponding estimates for last year. The coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could be desired. There Is, however, ono place where additional defense Is badly needed, and that Is at the mouth ot Chesa peake Bay, where it is proposed to make an artificial Island for a fort which shall prevent an enemy's fleet from entering this most Important strategical base of operations on tho whole Atlantic and Gulf coasts. I hope that appropriate legislation will be adopted to secure the construction of this defense. The return of the battleship fleet from its voyago around the world in more efficient condition than when It started was a noteworthy event ot interest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. Owing to the necessity for economy In expenditures, I have directed the curtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are thirty-eight millions less than the corresponding estimates of last year, and the request for new naval con struction is limted to two flrst-cluss battleships and one repair vessel. Tbe generosity ot Congress having provided in the present naval ob servatory the most magnificent and expensive astronomical establishment In the world, the President urges a provision by law for the appointment of an eminent astronomer as the offi cial head of the observatory. The deplorable delays in the ad ministration ot civil and criminal law have received the attention of com mittees ot the American Bar associa tion and of many State bar associa tions, as well as the considered thought ot Judges and jurists. In my Judgment, a change in Judicial procedure, with a view to reducing Its expense to private litigants In civil caws and facilitating the dispatch ot business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, constitutes the greatest need in our American constitutions. I therefore recommend lenlslatlon providing for the appointment by the President of a commission with au thority to nam Ine the law and equity procedure of the Federal courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the Supreme Court and the costs imuflBed In such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make recom mendation with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making it as inex pensive as may be to tho litigant of little means. The President nlsn recommends, that, in compliance with the Repub lican Party's platform promise on the subject of legislating against the practice ot issuing injunctions with out previous notice, an appropriate law to that end b adopted. The Jurisdiction of the general 1 Government over interstate commerce has led to the passage of the so-callA "Bherman Anti-Trust law" and th "Interstate Commerce law" and Its amendments. The developments In the operation of those laws, as shown by indictments, trials. Judicial deci sions and other sources ot Informa tion, call for a discussion and torn suggestions as to amendments. These I prefer to embody In a special mes sage Instead of Including them In the present communication. After earnestly recommending the passage of a sufficient appropriation to enable a thorough remodeling of the Jail In the District ot Columbia, postal matters are reviewed. The deficit every year in the Post office Department Is largely caused, avers the President, by the low rate of postage of one cent a pound charged on second class mall matter. A great saving mignt De maae, amounting to much more than half of the loss, by Imposing upon maga zines aud periodicals a higher rate ot postage. The second subject worthy of men tion in tho Postofflce Department l the real necessity and entire practica bility of establishing postal savings banks. The successful party at tbe last election declared in favor ot postal savings banks, and, although the proposition finds opponents in many parts of the country, I am con vinced that the people desire such banks and am sure that when the banks are furnished they will be pro ductive of tbe utmost good. Following the courso of my distin guished predecessor, I earnestly rec ommend to Congress the considera tion and passage of a ship subsidy bill looking to the establishment of lines between out Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast ot South America as well as lines from the west coast of the United States to South Amer ica, China, Japan and the Philip pines. The successful party In the last election In Its national' platform de clared In favor of the admission as separate States ot New Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend that legis lation appropriate to this end be adopted. With respect to the Territory ot Alaska, I recommend legislation which shall provide for the appoint ment by the President of a Governor aud also of an executive council, which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable It to give to the Territory local laws adapted to Its present growth. In several departments there Is pre sented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation ot our national resources, and the sub ject is one of such importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be entered upon In this communication. Mr. Taft also makes the following; suggestions and recommendations: The transfer of control over the lighthouses to a suitable civilian bureau. The passage of a law to enable the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to unite the Bureaus ot Manufactures and Statistics. Additional legislation to help sup press the "white slave trade." That all the bureaus and offices In the general Government which have to do with the public health or sub jects akin thereto be united In a bu reau to be called the "bureau ot pub lic health." That a law be passed requiring that candidates in elections ot members ot the House of Representatives file in a proper office of the United States Government a statement of the con tributions received and of the ex penditures incurred in the campaign. That Congress appropriate a suf ficient sum to pay the balance about thirty-eight per cent. of the amounts due depositors tn the Freed man's Savings and Trust Company. The year 1913 will make tbe fiftieth anniversary of the Issuance of tho emancipation proclamation grant ing freedom to the negroes. It seems fitting that thlB event should be prop, erly celebrated. It Is suggested that a proper form of celebration would bo an exposition to show the progress the negroes have made. President Taft concludes as fol lows: I havo thus, in a Message com pressed as much as the subjects will permit, referred to many of the legis lative needs of the country, with the exceptions already noted. Speaking generally, the country is in a high state of prosperity. There Is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business expan sion, and we have Just garnered a harvest unexampled tn tbe market value of our agricultural products. Tho high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community; but, on the other band, they mean a very con siderably increased burden upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does not expand with the Improvement in business and the general prosperity. Various reasons are given tor the high prlees. The proportionate Increase in the output of gold, which to-day Is the chief medium of exchange and Is In some respects a measure of value, fur niches a substantial explanation of at least part of the increase in prices.
