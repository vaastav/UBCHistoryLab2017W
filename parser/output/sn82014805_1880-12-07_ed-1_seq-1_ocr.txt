Special reported for the Uazrttb. New Castle, Dec. fi.—Immediately aller the o e ting of Court, this mi ru ing, Chief Justice Comegys charged the jury In the case or the Delaware *S a • Fire and Marine Insurance Company vs. Wm. T. Croasdale. A summary of the charge was promptly forwarded to the Gazette, and the loliowing are some of the salient points: TUB QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP. The witnesses for the plaintiff have proved that the defendant was editor In chief of the Ercry Evcnimj , and that the libelous articles were published in the editorial columns of tha' paper. Bell aud Humphrey occasio ally wrote editorials lor the paper, but they did not write the e in question, nor did they k who wrote them. They also test ified that other parties occasionally wrote editorial articles, but they did not know who these parties were. The ( lain!iff' has offered proof that the defendant wrote the editorials, and the question is is this proof sufficient for the jury. If it is not, then they should return a verdict of "not guilty," and that ends the matter. THE EFFECT OF MALICE. The charge specially informed the jury how the question of malice could affect their verdict. If they believed that every one of the defendant's charges were true and proper for public informa tion,but should find that the defend ant, at the time, was rctuaied by malici ous and mischievous motives they can lind lor the plaintiff • • • • The motives can be gathered from the ci rtu instances of the publication, a id if none thereby appear, they ruusl he taken from the paper Itself. WAS TIIH PLAINTIFF A FRAUD? On this ground the charge reviewed ar lei.gtli the evidence iu regard to the ixHefs of the company. Il had been tes tified (h it no capital stock had been sub scribed "at * he organization, hut that Were accepted and if these ally worth thei y had a capital, e inortgak.'sc|were of low value, conclude the I, unies the plaintiff mortgag mortgages w«* value, then the comp; If rh then the jury pany was a f. akns Hi ton good to their satisfaction either ju.iljr There has been no direct, effort Hide to impeach the character of witnes* I they nil appear to he men mind character, although there in a wide discrepancy In their statement*, gard to the Dauphi defendant's wl'c r laud with y of limber, three and the nearest railroad station, and no nenils.

Ing OTHKU BUSINESS. close of the libel suit the further argued, aud Alter the Cleuisou case wav Court reserved its decision. Tlie next case argued was Jacob B. Caxier vs. Lum's admimslrator Win.C. Spruance, Esq., for plaintiff, UeorgeGray, Esq-, for defendant. Ihe facts seem to be these: Isaac A. Lutn and wife gave a mort gage on tlie property. After his dea'h.his the defendant, Charles A. Luis, gave a mortgage upon Ins Interest. He and tlie widow were appointed adiuinn uator and administratrix. I he first mortgage was paid. The creditor un der tlie second mortgage now asks that tho remainder of the money, now in cc ri, bo paid to him and not lo the ad ministrator (Charles A. Luui). The |C ?Â"caudale vs. Dr. Tantum in which damages were recovered by plaintiff last term for *725 1 was brought {„, by Mr. Lore, and a motion made for ^gw trial. Hi. ground iu support ot tliat of son the motion was because the jury, in ascertaining the amount of damages, sorted to this means, viz.: The jury agreed that each one should write re on a R iec ? of P a P« r wllat h « thought du», put the twelve pieces lu a hat, and then when taken out, all the sums should be added together and divided by twelve, and the result shoud he the amount of damages due to plaintiff. The Court reserved the question until the Court of Errors and Appeals should meet in January. J. L. Vallandighain, Esq., moved for a new trial in the case ol Kennedy Woodrow. The principal ground was because the defendant and bis friend Edward Finley, conferred with one of the jurors, J. 11. Poach by name, and that he was influenced by them iu ar riving at his verd'ct. This motion was granted by the court. The rule was made returnable the first day of next VI.

Frank Ellison, Republican, who was elected Levy Court Commissioner at the recent election, was not duly qualified at the time of his election, aud is therefore not entitled to his seat in the Levy Court. The law requires as part of the qualifications ot this office that the mem ber shall be a freeholder at the time of his election. It is known to a certainty that the fa'herof Dr. Ellison, on the 17th of November—two week after the election — went before a Notary Public and ac knowledged a deed conveying to bis sou a small house aud lot of land in Pencader Hundred, and stated at the lime that it was done for the purpose \ ol qualifying him lor the position to which he had just been elected. 1 ester day a Gazette reporter examined the assessment book of Pencader Hundred, in the office of the Clerk of the Peace, and found I)r. Ellison assessed with a capitation of but no property whatever, thus signifying that he was not a freeholder, when the Assessor made bis last return. The question will be examined by the attorney of the Levy Court, George Gray, Esq., and ditermined at the organization ot the new Court, in February next. BOLD ROBBERY.

Washington, December 6.—Assis tant Surgeon C. Glasier, at Key West, Fla., reports to the Marine Hospital Bureau that fishermen retiring Iront» the coast ol Florida with Arab in an apart ment of tlislr boats eommumca'ing freely with the surrounding water have had them die suddenly certain kind of water, distinguishable by its color. There is nothing kuown to the origin of the poisonous quali ties of the waters that affect the fish iu tl Is way, but the prevalent opinion seems to be that there is something emptied into the beds of the fresh watercourses from volcanic or geyser like aprings, and that as soon as the water thus impregnated reaches the sea it kills every living thing that comes under its influence. reaching a Reception of Hayes' Message. Washington, December 6.—In tlie Senate to-day Mr. Burch, the Secretary, waded through the Message in about ninety iniuii es.

RECEPTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE BY CONGRESS. Washington, Dec. 0, 1880. RECEPTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S MES SAGE—FEELING IN FAVOR OF MAK ING GRANT CAPTAIN GENERAL. The message attracts but iittle atten tion. An exception, liowever, must be made. The President's recommenda tion that General Graut be made Cap General is a universal subject of conversation quarters it is laughed at, but more us liy it is takeu seriously, and there is little doubt that a bill will be intro duced at this session in accordance with the recommendation of the message.— It will have slroug Democratic support, and will probably pass both houses, as there is a feeling of good will ou both ailles toward the General and a desire to him honorably provided for by Con instead of leaving him dependent private munificence. The real senti ment of the best men, democrats a9 wel! republicans, is that General Grant ought to be so placed and provided for Congress as tb place him outside of and above mere partisan politics or pri vate adventures ; and to make him Cap lam General on the retired list, with a handsome and sufficient salary for his life ami with an honorable position, it it believed, would accomplish this. MR. HAYES' STALWART ATTITUDE TO WARD THE SOUTH. Surprise is expressed at the very stal wart attitude of the Message toward the South. Some of the Southern men say tliat when the President, in an official communication to Congress, assarts that there have been extensive election frauds some States, he ought to show that he speaks from informationand that he is prepared to submit evidence to Congress on the matter. tftl tbis evening.
