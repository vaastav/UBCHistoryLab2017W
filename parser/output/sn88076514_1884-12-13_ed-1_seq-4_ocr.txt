Dakota will get two thirds of all such immigration. THE complaint in Frank A. .Willson's contest case against Jud La Moure for a seat in the legislative council will be found in full elsewhere in this issue. It charges divers irregularities and illegal ities in Walsh county and alleges a con spiracy on the part of the majority of the district canvassing board to defraud Willson of the majority of votes cast for him. I^'By the way," says HanBbrough, "Edwards was a Democrat before lie «ameto Dakota."

He had: in itiind, no doubt, that Cavalier county deal—41972 for $500 worth of supplies—and didn't care to purchase the friendship of the Argus man by giving him Walsh county's book work on a similar margin of profit. THE party of alleged reform, alleged purity $nd alleged justice, now that it is in power, will have an opportunity to exercise its alleged fairness in the en actment of legislation in the.interest of the long-suffering people of Dakota. On this subjeotthe Philadelphia News says: Dakota cast over 85,000 votes in the November election. This is more than the vote of New Hampshire or Vermont. It.is 10,000 more than Rhode Island', Del aware and Nevada combined twice as large as that of Colorado, and half as large again as Oregon. Yet Dakota is not a state. Her vote indicates a popu lation of half a million, which would en title her to two senators, three congress men and five presidential electors. Da kota ought to be admitted as a state of this union. The only reason why she is not admitted by congress is that she casts a Republican majority of about 65,000. THE Devils Lake Demoorat, a bright, crisp little sheet, made its appearance Thursday morning full of local news and a good showing of advertising. It is published by the Democrat Printing Co., of which Bobert Cairnes is presi dent and H. D. Wilcox is secretary, The latter is an old-time printer and publisher. The editor says in his salutatory: The publication of the Democrat is purely, a business enterprise. Its pro' jectors are not candidates for the pos office, land .office, or other political favors. Neither do they expect or desire to control the action of the party. So far as it is able to promote the interests of true democracy the Democrat will do, yet it: will not be so radical that liberal minded men of all parties cannot give it •f". a hearty welcome. It will devote the greater part of its energies to making a rdhdable,local paper. Further promises, we do not, at present, care to make. AN ILLUSTRIOUS TRINITY.

The niore we read and hear of Grover Cleveland the more of a conundrum he bewmes. lie is either possessed of a very superior quality of knowledge or else he knows but little mbre than the average man, having a perplexing fac ulty for keeping, that little to himself. Thus far his brightest trait is silence. In his letter of acceptance he did not say much—and this was the commen dable feature of it. He said something about "constitutional gpvernment," but we foundsthe same thing, more strongly expressed, in Blaine's letter. He wrote a few sentences on the subject of De mocracy, just enough to remipd us that ~he was the Democratic nominee, but he was quite economical, where his party predecessors have been very extrava gant, in "enunciating the undying prin ciples of the great and glorious party of reform." He said nothing about "Dem ocratic principles," and was generally careful to avoid reference to things'in tangible. There was wisdom in what he did not say and it was disappointment among extreme partisans over the un said things in Cleveland's letter that led to the movement a month before elec tion to .have him withdraw. There was not enough Hendricksism in bis utter ances, .and the strange attachment of former pronounced Republicans to his candidacy alarmed the Bourbon wing of the Democracy. The old party lead ers were mystified. They couldn't de termine in their own minds if Cleve land's election would be in reality a Democratic victory. They were not certain on the point of whether his nom ination wasn't a trick. They felt like dupes, and metaphorically pinched themselves to see* if they were really Democrats. Since his election Cleveland has main tained comparative silence, and there is nothing in his general public acts and expressions that can be regarded in the light of assurance that he intends to have a set policy, or that he will attempt to be guided by the policy of the party that claims him. It is certainly true that he owes his election to Republican factions—to men who never trained with the Democratic party to men who, even now, while they rejoice over his success, denounce the extreme methods and- language of those Democrats who furnished over two-thirds of the elec toral votes that made Cleveland presi dent. Hence, Cleveland's election is not a vindication of "the undying principles" of the party 5Mi that nominated him, no more than the defeat of Gen. Hancock was confirmation of the existence of those "principles." The clamor for office that will go up from the Demo crats when Cleveland takes his seat as president will thoroughly lest the met tle that he is made of. If he resists Bourbon pressure and maintains a grate ful regard for tne men who really made him president, the"urtdying principles" will be in a fair way of perishing, and Cleveland's administration will go down in history—way down—among the po litical anomolieBs If, on the other hand, he serves the party that gave him the nomination, regardless of the combina tions and circumstances that really gave him the presidency, his name will be transcribed in imperishable letters Upon the monument of Democracy immedi ately beneath that of the immortal Jackson. No word of his yet spoken would in dicate that Cleveland is an "undying" Democrat no utterance to which he has given expression would contradict the theory that he is an Independent. We do not believe his acts, after the 4th of March, will justify the claim that he will be either one or the other, and the coun try at large may contihue to inquire, What is he? 

WHEAT LEGISLATION. A petition is being largely circulated along the Northern Pacific road asking the passage of a bill embodying the views contained in the following: 1. That all persons, firms or corpora tions operating railroads in this Terri tory shall receive and transport grain in bulk, in carload quantities, from any person, firm or corporation, at any sta tion or siding from which it is customary to ship grain or freight, and shall deliver the same to any person, firm or corpora tion to whom the same may be consigned at any regular station to which said per sons or corporations shall run trains. Provided, such consignee or the elevator or warehouse can be conveniently reached by any track owned, leased or used by such corporation and provided, further, that such railroad corporation may make rules and regulations requir ing cars to be loaded within twenty-four hours after being placed at the disposal of the shipper. 2. That all persons, firms or corpora tions shipping grain shall be charged the same rates of freight for the same kinds of grain, in carload lots, from the same station to the same station, and no rebate shall be allowed to any person, firm or corporation. 3. That all persons, firms or corpora tions operating a railroad in the Terri tory shall keep posted in each of their freight offices their rates of freight on grain, in carload lots, from that station to every other station to which it shall be cuBtomary to ship grain and" when ever: the rate shall be changed the new schedule shall be so posted. 4. That any person, firm or corpora tion operating a railroad in this Terri tory that shall refuse or neglect to pro vide, within a reasonable time, such car or cars as Bhall be demanded by any per son or corporation for the' shipment of grain in bulk shall forfeit and pay to the party aggrieved the sum of 9100 for every car so refused or not provided to be recovered by the party aggrieved in an action brought in any court having jurisdiction of the amount and any per son or corporation that said railroad company shall cause to pay a greater rate of freight for the shipment or grain in bulk, in carload lots, than said rail road. company shall collect from any other person or corporation on like freight between the same stations, shall be entitled to recover from said railroad company for each car on which such greater rate of freight shall have been collected as aforesaid the sum of (100, to be recovered by the party aggrieved in anaction brought in any court having jurisdiction of the amount.

Willson against Jud La Moure for a seat in the legislative council promises interesting developments. C. B. Pratt, of Grand Forks, is Willson's counsel. The com plaint is as follows: To Judson La Moure—Sir: You will take notice that I, Frank A. Willson, intend to contest vour election as a 'member of the legislative council for. said district for illegalities, frauds, irregularities and misdemeanors, perpetrated, practiced, indulged and allowed by voters, judges and clerks of election precincts, town and county canvassing boards and oth ers at said late election, which was held on Nov. 4,1884, at the various precincts and voting places within and for said counties aforesaid, being a general elec tion of territorial councilmen and other officials, which said frauds, irregularities, informalities and misdemeanors then and there occurring are desoribed more particularly: First—Because you did not receive a majority of the legal' votes cast for mem ber of the territorial counoil at the last general election held "in Said Twelfth council and representative distriot. Second—Because the undersigned, Frank A. Willson, received a majority of all the legal votes cast for member of the territorial council, and was duly and legally elected a member thereof. That in the First ward in the city of Grafton, in said county of Walsh, 50 illegal votes were cast on the 4th day of November, 1884, said votes being illegal for the reason that all of the fifty per sons casting said votes were non-resi dents of said ward and city. That in the Second ward of said city of Grafton seventeen (17) illegal votes were cast on the 4th d»y of November, 1884, said votes being illegal for the reason that all of the 17 persons voting the same were non-residents of said ward and said city.. That in the'Third ward of said city of Grafton forty-five (45) illegal votes were cast on the 4th day of No vember, 1884, said votes being illegal from the fact that all of the 45 persons voting the same were non-residents of said ward and' city, all of which last mentioned 60,17 and 45 illegal votes so cast in the said city of Grafton were cast for (you) Judson La Moure in fraud of this contestant and in violation of the rights and will of the electors.

The Democratic House of Represent atives has inaugurated the old plan of creating a big dust to hide its party tracks. Mr. Follett, who was beaten for congress by Ben Butterworth, wants an investigation in*,the district that failed to give him a majority. The Chicago Tribune suggests that the investigation be extended to the south, and says: The last time that the Republican vote of South Carolina was counted, was in 1876, and it then gave Hayes 91,870 and Tilden 90,906, showing a total vote of 182,776. In 1880 by the census returns the number of legal voters in the state was 204,782. At the recent election the total vote cast was but 91,623, of which the Bourbons took 69,890, returning for the Republicans only 21,733. Thus in a Republican state giving Cleveland and Hendricks 48,167 majority! But where have the 70,000 other Republican votes that were cast for Hayes gone? Certainly not to Cleveland, for his vote falls below Tilden's and Hancook's. As less than a fifth of the Republican vote was cast, or if cast counted by the Bourbons, the lat ter did not deem it necessary to turn out in full strength 25,000 Bourbons staid away from the polls, and 80,000 Republi can votes were either not cast or counted. The whole election in that state was a farce. The eight box plan was sufficient of itself to keep out the vote of an im mense number of colored Republicans. By arranging eight boxes for separate candidates and stationing white men at the polls to tell the Bourbons where to place their votes the Bourbon votes were all polled. The total number of voters in Alabama four years ago was 141,641 white and 118,423 colored, a total of 259,884. The total vote cast at the recent election was 153,789, showing a falling off of 106,095. The decrease is shown in the disfran chisement of colored voters and in the failure of many BourbonB to vote, be cause their vote was unnecessary. *r. r^, *s ,w?l votes being illegal for the reason that all of the 20 jersons casting the same were non-residents of said township, all of Which 20 illegal votes were cast for said Judson La Moure ^and .infraud.ofthis .contestant..!" j' That in the township of St. Andrews, in saidi Walsh county, thirty-two (32) illegal, votes were cast on the said 4th day of November, 1884, said votes being illegal for the reason that 12 of the per sons casting the same were minors, not being twenty-one years of age, and the remaining 20 persons casting the Same were non-residents of.said township of St. Andrews, all of which said 32 illegal votes were oast for you said Judson La Moure and.in fraud of this contestant. That on said 4th. day of November! 1884,16 legal votes were cast -for this contestant at the' township of Latona, in sai& Walsh, county, that the. board of 'county, commissioners' of said Walsh county refused to .[ count the same and rejected all of said votes. That in the said county of Pembina, on the said 4th day of November, 1884, 1542 votes were cast for this contestant and 1325 cast for yoU' Judson La Moure, this contestant, receiving a majority of 217 of said V^tes. 15 That the legtsl^tlva canvassing board for the said Twelfth legislative distriot in session on the 22d day of November, A.

That the several judges of eleotion received all of the said illegal votes of said Grafton, Acton and St. Andrews, knowing the same to be illegal, and the said board of canvassers refused to count and canvass the said returns from said Pembina county, well knowing the same to be true and correct returns thereof, and thi^ contestant alleges on information and belief, and thereupon he charges the fact to be that the judges of said election and the board of county canvassers and the legislative' canvass ing board of the said Twelfth legislative district 'combining and confederating together how to defraud the will of the people in their choice of member of legislative council for the said Twelfth legislative district, caused or allowed to be carried out each and a^l the frauds and irregularities hereinbefore referred to and set forth that said frauds, illegal ities and irregularities changed the hon est choice of the people for member of the legislative council from the said Twelfth distriot, and fraudulently and wrongfully gave the mcyority to (you) Judson La Moure, and in fraud of this contestant. FRANK A. WILLSON, JHifh^llL Contestant,- WASHINGTON LETTER. Convening of Congress Demo cratic Joy—Logan. Special Oorroepondence of the INTKE-OCKA*.] WASHINGTON, Deo. 6.—The first week of the second session of the Forty-eighth congress has ended. Already both of the legislative bodies have settled down to work. This they did almost as na turally (ind quietly as if only a week in stead of five, months had intervened be tween the last and present meeting. On last Monday when the president of the senate and the speaker of the house brought down their gavels exactly at noon, thus opening congress, crowds of visitors filled the gallerise both cham bers had an air of freshness and cleanli ness, and the desks of senators and rep resentatives were loaded with flowers. Otherwise there was but little to indi cate that it was the beginning of a new session. One interesting and decidedly unusual feature of the occasion was the good natured chaffing indulged in by the Democrats at the expense of their Re pnblican friends over the result of the presidential election. The Republicans took the bantering in good part, and no bitterness WHS manifested. Congressman Cox of New York was conspicuously busy in offering condolence to nis polit ical opponents. The Democrats are in fine spirts, but the Republicans skillfully conceal any dejection they may feel. The Southern members are not so demonstrative as it was predicted they would be. They congratulated eaoh other on the Demo cratic victory, but they seemed to be impressed with the duty of restraining hilarity in presence of their defeated opponents. The president's message was listened to in both houses with the usual inat tention.- The proportion of senators and members who lounged and looked bored and tried to kill time was consid erably greater than the number of at tentive listeners..Congressmen consider the official reading of clerks very mo notonous, and prefer to get their im pressions of an executive document from their own perusal of it. After an extended inquiry among them. I learn that, as a whole, they think President Arthur's last annual'message is his best. They praise it for its dignity, for its tem per, and for the clearness and simplicity of its style. But the report of the secretary of the treasury is more commented upon than the president's message. It has been called the most vigorous presentation of the financial condition of the country that has ever been made. Mr. McCul loch has pleased the friends of lower taxes in his tariff recommendations, but his position will doubtless excite a great deal of dissent in his own party. The first sensation of the session was raised in the house of representatives by Congressman Follett's impeachment resolutions. He brought charges against Marshal Lot Wright in connection with the employmentof deputy marshals at the election in Cincinnati. A short, bitter debate followed, in which Messrs. Converse, Hiscock, Reed, Brumm, Mil ler and ex-Speaker Keifer took part, and the resolutions were finally adopted. The new senator, Mr. Sheffield, who is the temporary successor of the late 8enatbr Anthony of Rhode Island, is about sixty years old. He is quite lame, ^•K iitimm ff, -V and walks laboriously with the assist ance of a large cane. His has a few straggling locks of hair, which he combs over a bald head, a benevolent counte nance, and prefers for an every-day gar ment, a la Senator Conger and Repre sentative Poland, a swallow-tailed coat. Senator Logan occupies his old seat in the^ senate cnamber between the two Maine senators, and was the first man to breakjthe brief silence after the chap lain's pAyer on opening day. Demo crate as well as Republicans sought the first opportunity to shake hands with the defeated candidate and pass some words of friendly greeting. Gen. Logan met them all 'with a smile and ready reply, but it'was evident that his old time exuberance of spirits could not be summoned at will. 

DAKOTA IN CONGRESS. Efforts for Division Interesting Figures. In the senate Wednesday, the business bftng consideration of the bill to divide Dakota on the 46th parallel and the ad mission of the southern half, Mr. Harri son said the movement for the admis sion of. anew state had originated where such movements ought to originate— with the people of the territory. A dis cussion of its admission to the Union could, of course, assume the shape of party discussion, but that was a shape unworthy of so important a question. To consider the application of people for admission to the Union from the point of view of its relation to the for tunes of apolitical party was to consider it from a level far below that of states manship. He believed the feeling in the territory was almost Unanimously in favor of the division of the northern and southern portions, and equally unani mous that the admission of the. whole territory as a single state would not be acceptable. Judged by population and producing capacity, Dakota was entitled to admission. In 1870 the improved lands and farms in the territory com prised 42,645 acres in 1880,1,160,413 acres. The number of farms in the territory in 1870 was 1270 in 1880,17, 489. The value of those of 1880 was $22,400,000, and the total value of the agricultural products of that year $15, 524,000.. This was a greater valuation than could be stated of several states. As to capacity to bear the burdens of state government, the territory was al ready defraying nearly all those ex penses in the territorial form of govern ment. With regard to the question how much population should entitle a territory to admission as a state, there had been no rule established by con gress. It had been suggested that pop ulation should be required at least equal to the unit of representation in the lower house of congress, which at this time would be a little over 150,000 persons. Few of the states, however, had had population enough at the time of their admission to bring them within that rule. No state, since the admission of Missouri in 1821, had population suffi cient to entitle it to one representative in congress. It was therefore a matter for the discretion of congress but even on the basis requiring such population, he believed that with the naturally rapid increase of population of the territory, the portion proposed to be admitted would, in a census taken at this time, show enough population to entitle it to two representatives. Taking up the question of ratio of voters to population, and the bearing of that question upon the admission of Da kota, Harrison stated the vote of Dakota in 1880 at 28,426, while in 1884 it was 86,000 increase, 57,574 voters in four years. Of the 86,000 votes nearly two thirds had been cast in Southern Dako ta, the portion seeking admission to the Union. Estimating only four inhabitants to a voter, Southern Dakota would now have a population of 230.000. In 1880 it had a population of 135,177, or a pro portion of 4.82 inhabitants to a voter. If it were objected that the proportion al lowed was too large, he would look at some other states. The proportion of voters to inhabitants in Florida in 1880 was one voter for every 5.22 inhabitants, Georgia one in 9.27, Mississippi one in nearly 10, Louisiana one in 9.67, Ala bama one in 8.46, Missouri one in 5.45. The average of those six states gave one in a little more than eight inhabitants to each voter. Mr. Harrison criticised the report of the minority of the committee on territories represented by Vest, which strongly opposes the admission of the territory, and which declares, if the statements of the advocates of ad mission are true, the proposed state is already an Elysium, and its people en joying every blessing of religion, educa tion and prosperity. Harrison thought this no answer to the demand of the large, active and progressive population when they claimed the right 'to elect their own governor and take part in making laws by which congress provides for their government. At one point Harrison said that Da kota, with a vote of 80,000, had no rep resentatives in congress.while Louisiana, with a vote of 90,000, had six members and two senators. Senator Gibson at once resented the allusion to the sup pression of the negro vote by charging that Dakota allowed unnaturalized for eigners to vote—a statement which was promptly refuted by a quotation from the election laws. This bill appears to have even chances of passing tne senate, but cold death awaits it in tne house. Look Out for Hiram. The St. Charles (Minn.) Union says there area baker's dozen on the liBt oi aspirants for thepostofficeat that place, but the editor suggests that "there is one important factor in the postoffice business that we presume has not been at all considered by the applicants now putting forward their Maims.
