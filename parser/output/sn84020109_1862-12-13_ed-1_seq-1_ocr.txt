Maraa 13th, IWt . tnJft-Tm 1 mr UNION, ONE AND HTSEPEKABLS, NOW Herdlns Cattle.- Extract fr on a Private Letter. Within a few vears a system of cattle-growing has been practiced in this country (111.) which changes the characteristics of prairie farming. The vacant lands are now bo general ly enelosed that the pasture "range" has become too narrow for the stock of the farmer, and this has led the owners of larce herds to establish "ranchos" or herding stations, on the borders of Inlet and Winnebago mar shes, to which aro gathered in the spring most of- the beef- and young cattle of this section for pasturage during the grazing season. In Octo ber they are returned to their owners who pay about one dollar per head, for salting and attendance, thus get ting a summer's growth at but slight expense compared with home feed ing, the animals thriving equally well. The farmers following this sysiem, are generally such as own from one hundred to one hundred and sixty acres of land, about one half being kept under cultivation, in corn, wheat, timothy, and the lesser crops. e cannot give a better idea of this system than by-some accouut of the farm and management of Ira Bv rcn, Esq. He has 240 acres of land, nearly one third of which is in with timothy, which he cuts as early as it is fit for seed, carrfully saving the , straw, as well as that of his .larger crops of wheat and oats in stacks for winter forajre. His cornfield also1 furnishes a large amount of fodder. He buys of his neighbors as he can, their one, two and three year olds, as before stated. In October, when the prairie grass is all dead, his tis mothy is excellent pasture, and here his stock is kept until snow comes, when they range the cornfields or feed at the straw stacks as taey choose. At the proper age, Mr. Brewer fat tens his cattle for the Chicago mar ket, feeding them liberally with corn in the ear. About sixtv hos follow the cattle to use up all the shelled corn and that which is voided whole. It is found that hogs do better when fed in this way than if fed corn in the ear fattening more readily and eco nomically. !This system has its advantages in allowing the profitable home consump tion of all the fodder as well as the coarse grains of the farm ; in ena bling the farmer to keep all the stock the farm will winter at but slight ex pense per head ; and in the large a- mount oi manure tnus iurnisnea ior keeping the .soil in highly productive state, lhe expense ot marketing tne product is far less than in the form of grain, and the prices are generally as remunerative. To Prepare Trees forPlantln With a sharp knife cut off sloping from the under side, any bruised or broken roots, then reduce the tops to correspond with the losis of roots, cut ting off the surplus branches, and reducing those forming the head to three or four buds cm each of last year's shoots. This will cause a more r . - -i l A xv r i. healthy anci vigorous kuooi me urbi season its omission is a common cause of the failure or sickly growth of newly planted trees. In setting, let one person hold the tree in its position, while another fills in the mellow earth, pressing it care fully among the roots with the hand, leaving no cavities underneath and when the roots are all covered, pres sing the whole down firmly with the foot. Avoid deep planting when all is finished, the tree should be not over two inches deeper than when in the nursery. Grapevines should be cut back to two or three eyes, and only one of these should be permitted to grow the first year. Blackberries and raspberries should be cut back to within one foot of the norund. Gooseberries and currants should he cut back to one or two eyes oflast season's growth. Trees planted in the Fall should have earth hilled up around the stem, six inches or mo;e in light, to hold them firmly in position during win ter, and protect th3 roots somewhat from frost and excess of wet. This is also a protection against injury by mice. In sprirg the earth should be leveled, and a few inches of coarse ma nure or litter spread on the surface over the roots for the space of four or five feet in diameter; this will keep the surface moist, prevent baking, and check the growth of weeds. If planting is done rather late in spring, and in dry weather, it is well to give water freely after setting the trees and covering the roots with earth letting it settle before finishing up ; then if the surface is mulched as re commended, no farther watering is necessary. No gras3 or grain crops should be grown araoBg fruit trees, at least un til they have arrived at bearing Bize, even then it is bad economy. tc y- Arir AETTTOKETE: DECEMBER 13, 1S62. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Second Session of the Thirty-Seventh Congresf, December 1st, 1SC2. FeUoiD Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives : j Since vour last assembling another year of health and bountiful harvest has passed, and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we cannot but press on, guarded by the best light he gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way, all will be well. OUR 

'FOREIGN RELATI05S. The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year, is herewith submitted, in vir tual compliance with a request to that effect, made by the House of Representa tive near the close of the past session of Congress. If the condition of our rela tions with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at other periods it has certainly been more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might have reasonably appre hended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to exnect that the maratime O A. powers which, at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and so unsuccessfully as we think, recognized the insurgents as a beligerent power, would soon recede from that position which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country, but the temporary reverses which afterwards befel the national arms and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple injustice. The civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the rations with which we have car ried on a commerce that has been stead ily increasing throughout the period of half a century. It has at the same time excited political ambitions and apprehen sions, wrhich have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have for borne taking part in any controversy be tween parties and factions in any such Stales. We have attempted no prcpa gandism and acknowledged norevelution, but we have left to every nation the ex clusive conduct and management of its own anairs. uur struggle has been or course contemplated by foieign nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects and the consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this Government, even if if it were just, would certainly be unwise. SUPPRESSION CF THE SLAVE TRADE. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of especial pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Ma jesty's government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authorities of the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the State dues has been car ried into full effect, under the act of Congress for that purposn. THE COAST BLOCKADE. A blockade of 3,000 miles of seacoast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present without commit fing occasional mistakes, and inflicting unintentional injurie upon foreign na tions and their subjects. A civil war, occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on a trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints .of the violations of neutral rights. All such collissions tend to ex cite misapprehensions and possibly to pro duce national reclamations between na tions which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been preferred by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubt ful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with the government whose protection is demanded by the claimants, lhere are, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citizen suffer wrongs from naval or mil itary authorities of foreign nations, which the government of these States are not prepared to redress.
