The Idea of a culture club in Gary rsecmed a month ago so utterly lncon grous that the possibility never oc curred to the mind of the most astute and far-seeing prophet. And yet, to day, Gary is so distinguished. It is not a large club to be sure, as Its membership is as yet confined to mine zealots but when once the men tal improvement germ begins to get in Its deadly work, there is no telling where it may end. It is barely poss Die that at no very distant date we may behold the establishment of uni versity extension classes where llrst the sand dune held absolute sway. The purpose of the club is that of the Esperanto organizations that are riKht now the fad of the hour, the es tablishment of a universal language supposed to be the first stepping stone toward the complete brotherhood of man. The movement had its origin In Harvard university and recalls the old days when "Volapuk" was agi tated throughout the world, something like twenty-live years ago. "Volapuk" was never generally adopted and enjoyed an ephemeral ex- iBtance. There are scoffers who as sert that the Esperanto tongue which embraces features from a number of languages will have as rugged a road to travel as President Roosevelt's re formed spelling movement. But this does not dampen the enthusiasm of the Esperanto disciples or moderate the seriousness of their efforts. They are sanguine of ultimate success and be sides the study makes an occasion for social intercourse and will doubt less be tho basis of much Jollification, More power to the Esperantos and to Garyl Bay we. Alfred A consul to editor of the old writes the Lake Notional Bank I)n!.. The Hartford Courant thinks that our national banking act is one of the 'wisest measures ever passed by con Kress, and though an incident of tht war It has needed vry little amend ment. The amazing growth of the country has resulted in paying off the bonds until a situation has developed that was not anticipated. But the Courant holds that the measure passed by tho house allowing banks to lend deposits or any funds on real estate ii dangerous in the extreme. It says i nis project lor permuting loans on real estate is a complete departure and a reversal of policy. It takes away -one of the safeguards of the sys ten. A life insurance company, whose obligations in the evry nature of th business can only mature gradually, can make real estate loans;, and there fire many millions so loaned. Indeed, the profits are largely gone out of that form of investment because it has been so widely entered into and competition has become so general. But a bank of discount cannot safely embark upon any business which ties up its resources. Salmon V. Chase, the iv!,. n who drew up the banking act, saw all this clearly and forbade i-o-.i ... ei:i:'nt. It would be a tre m'nious mistake to undo that conser vative provision, and the next step would, probably be to base currency on such loans. The end of that road has always been smash, and would be smash if traveled again WiNSLOW IT 

VALPARAISO United States Consul to the Stricken City Writes of His Long Trip. TAKES 111 Gift ZONE Ylnlow, United States A'alparaiaio and formerly Hammond Tribune County Timet the following aketch of his trip and conditions lie found there: the Valparaiso, Chile, Nov. 1, 1906. Editor Times Believing a short sketch of our six weeks' trip to this bright and sunny land would be of interest to many of your readers, many of whom we class as our friends, I have prepared the following: On Sept. 4, we left Crown Point over the Panhandle for ashlngton IX C, where we remained two days attending to official matters with the department of state, leaving for New York Thurs day evening. From that time until Tuesday at 3 p. m. we were busy ar ranging to pall and sight seeing. We took the steamer Panama, of the Panama railroad line a very good steamer of 6,700 tons and arrived at Colon the following Monday morning. On our way down we passed In sight of San Salvador Island and imagined we could see where Columbus landed somthing over 400 years before. Then later wo came in sight of the east end or Cuba wnere every tning seemea oulet. but we were not sure but what the revolutionists were raiding over the mountains we could see in the dis tance. We also got a glimpse of Haiti a little later on. The steamer was well filled with passengers for the Isthmus We found Colon a very hot and filthy place save where the Americans have taken matters in hand and put things in shape. They have taken full pos session of one of the suburbs, and made it a fine healthy place in which to live, and had just begun to improve the streets of tho town proper preparatory to caving. Most of the inhabitants of the place that we saw ranked well with their surroundings. They were a dirty and lazy lot. We took the noon train for Panama. forty-seven miles away, traveling much of the time in sight of the new canal. In manv daces larse forces of men and Immense dredges were at work loadln long trains of cars with clay and rock. As we Btopped at one station seven or eight blasts were discharged In a deep cut near that made the windows rattle. One could see activity on everv nana maenine snops neing nuiu and equipped, railroad tracks and sld insrs being put in, and neat houses being built. On reaching Panama we were much surprised to find a city of 2o,000 or 30.000 people with streets paved with brick, finely lighted by electricity, and a water supply equal to most any in uic states. The Americans have done won ders for the place, and It Is appreciated. for one hears compliments for the Am erican officials and their work, on every hand. While here I called on Gov Mneoon and other IT. S. officials and found them all in good spirits and con fldent of a speedy and satisfactory completion of the canal work. Mrs. WInslow asked Mrs. John Stevens, wife of the chief engineer in charge of the work, how long she expected to stay. ami sue saia not more man seven years for I expect the canal will be fin lshed before that time. We were in Panama the week Score tary of State Elihu Root and party visited that place, and had the pleas ure of meeting them as they landed about two hours before our boat sailed for the south. The city was elabo rately decorated in their honor, and great preparations were made to en tertain them in royal style. We were invited to the reception and ball, but we could not get the boat to wait un til the next day. It was but little warmer in Panama while we were there than when we left New York, and Dr. Carter, chief of the snnitarv department of the Canal Zone said to me that there had not been case of yellow fever at Tanama since last December, and that the general health of the place was excellent. We sailed out of the bay of Panam just as the sun was sinking into the Pacific on the steamer Peru, of the Pacific Steam Navigation company line, a steamer of about 3,000 tons very nicely fitted up for passengers We had two fine state rooms about SxlO, with a door between, situated on the promenade deck. For the first day out it was rather warm, but after that it was cool most of the time too cool for comfort. I feel quite sure you will have difficulty in believing me when I say that when we crossed the equator it was too cool to sit out on the deck, but it was a fact and contin ued so most of the way to Valparaiso. I wore my overcoat ofter when on the deck for a walk, and slept under two heavy woolen blankets and a spread. This is on account of the Antarctic stream that Hows up the west coast of South America. Its water at this time of the year is aoout t;, and as the wind blows constantly with the stream the air is about the same temperature, and even seems cooler when the steam er is moving at about ten miles per hour. We arrived at Guayaquil, Equador. the following Wednesday morning, after travelling S35 miles. This is a city of 70.000 located on the banks of a river by the same name, about forty miles from the Pacific. It is one of the worst plague and yellow fever spots on the globe, so we did not go ashore. We left In the evening for Callao, Peru, where we arrived the fol lowing Wednesday morning after stop ping at several way ports to take on and put off cargo. We stopped at Callao for three days for cargo, during which time we went ashore, and visited Lima, the capital of Peru, only about eight miles from the port by electric cars a really up-to-date American line. Lima is a fine city, and well up-to-date. It has a population of 200,000 with fine paved streets and good street car service. We took dinner with the American minister and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley of California. Thev are very pleasant people, and were highly compllmented by all who spoke of them. The hotel accommodations here were good, but we found it too cool for comfort, so returned to the steamer for warmer clothing after one night of it. Minister Dudlev the secretarv of the legation, and the American consul general, were at the steamer to see us off. We left Callao Saturday evening, Oct. and arrived at Valparaiso Oct. 16, after making seven stoos at wav r.orts. The Pacific coast from a little south of Guayaquil to about 200 miles north of Valparaiso is entirelv barren of e?etation save where it is irrigated, for it has not rained there for ages. The steamers sail most of the way in sight of land, but one sees nothing but barren mountains, not a tree to be seen. We had most beautiful sailing all the way, not meeting with a storm of any kind. We both stood the triD nicely and arrived here in :ood shape. On our arrivel here we found things very much torn up by the earthquake, but really were surprised to find that so much had been done to Dut thlnirs right. All the public utilities were in good shape such as the waterworks, as, electric lights, electric street cars, telephones, etc. Also the streets were well cleaned up and business was mov ing on much as ever. Wo were met on the boat by parties who escorted us to the best hotel in the city where fine accommodations had been engaged for us. We were really surprised to find such accommodations. They were about equal to any to be found in the United States in a city of 100,000 people. The proprietor i3 an American and well up-to-date.

It must have been a terrible tiling. We see long rows of what were three ind four story brick buildings lying in one mass of ruins. All the theatres were destroyed and many of the churches, together with the cathedral. The eastern portion of the city for four or five blocks back from the bay suffered much more than other parts of the city, but there was scarcelv a building In the city that did not suffer more or less, by way of cracked walls, etc. The portion of the city that suf fered most was built on made land and along the water's cdere.

I called on the English consul the other day and found the consulate in a building that runs through from one street to another, and both fronts had fallen out and left only the par titions and the roof standing.

NEW YORK LETTER. New York, Dec. 14. The sensational advance which was started in St. Paul yesterday was resumed again today and on a more gigantic scale than ever. The buying was of the most aggressive character that has yet appeared. It opened around 192 and advanced steadi ly until the tape showed an advance of about six points for the day. The talk in the street is enthusiastically bullish on this property. Rumors are current that the Standard Oil crowd are behind this upward movement and they are "gunning" for one of the larger shorts. Talk of a corner in it is heard on all sides. Brokers who usually operate for the Harrlman interests were conspicu ous buyers of St. Paul all during the j session, competetlve buying for control of the road was In advance on all sides. After the early weakness at the opening, the general market turned strong and buoyant. The sharp de clines established yesterday were more or less regained this afternoon. Union Pacific and Southern Pacific each scored an advance of about three points re spectively; Atchison one and one-half and the Hill stocks. Great Northern and Northern Pacific rebounded from their extreme weakness of yesterday and ad vanced two points each. There seems to be general disappointment over the Great Northerns action in regard to the Issuance of additional stock. Some of the shrewder traders are of the opinion that the condition of the money market is not opportune for the floating of ad ditional securities. Call loans were again high, ruling at 13 to 14 per cent for large amounts. Canadian Pacific was another one of the strong features of the day and es tablished a new high record, selling above 201. The buying was on a large scale and was presumably for foreign stockholders. The market closed strong within a few fractions of the highest prices of the day. corn. The speculative market lost f about a hale a cent for the day. OATS Followed in the trend of the balance of the grain markets, selling off fractionally from the opening. Ex port demand continues good; cash de mand for the best grade of oats is also reported better. The market closed steady. SOUTH WATER STREET MARKET. Chicago, Dec. 14.

It is not an uncommon thing as one walks along the street in most any part of the city to see a portion of a wall gone, or a great crack being re piired. The hotel where we stop was injured as little as any building, I guess, and workmen have been busy repairing It ever since the earthquake, and it will take them two or three months longer. It is a big building as it has more than 100 rooms. In the dining room we hear about as much English as any other language and on the streets and in the business places English is spoken on every hand. It is quite a hustling city, and there are many fine business houses here. One can get anything one wishes un less it be up-to-date American enter prise, and we claim to have a little of that in the American consulate. We have been here now three weeks and have felt only one earthquake. and that was not a very strong one.
