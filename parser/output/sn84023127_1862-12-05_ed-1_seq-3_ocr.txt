THE BURLINGTON FREE PRESS, FRIDAY MORNING DECEMBER 5 1802. Of the engagement at Cave llill. At., mentioned Tuesday, Gen. Blunt telegraph that the rebels are badly whipped, and wi probably not venture north ol the Boston .Mountains again this winter, and as they nave consumed all the subsistence in the val ley o( the Arkansas, they must soon retreat into Texas. The rebels numbered cOOO, our troops 5000. Sixty rebels were killed. Gen. Halleclt, Commaadei-in-Chief.in his report to the Secretary of Yar, states that he started on the 24th of July, to visit the Army ot the Potomac to ascertain if there was a possibility of an advance upon Rich mond lrom Harrison's Landing, and if not to torn some plan ol uniting tbe armies oi Generals Pope and McClellan, who was of the opinion that it would require 50.000 more men to go on. Halleck replied that there could not jwssibly be sent moie than 20,000. McClellan asked to consider the matter till inotnin.;, when he agreed tu go on with thut number. On Gen Halleck 's arrival Iiome he received a dispatch, saying that at least35,000 would be required. The rejiort states that such reinforcements could not be sent without leavinz Baltimore and Washington almcst defenceless, and an order for the withdrawal ol the Ajmy of the Potomac was issued August 3J. A previous order had been given for the removal of the tick in transports in vast numbers surplied But a protest from McClellan was received, and the order was not executed till the 14th. On the 1st, Gen. Burnside was ordered to leave Newborn for Acquia Creek, and arriv ed there promptly on the 31. The operations near Washington are re viewed. He says that a portion of the aimy ol the Potomac was ordered to tho front from Alexandria. Porter failed to execute bis crders for some unexplained reason, and his corps was not engaged in the battles of the 2Mb and -Jth, in which lien, l'ope gam ed considerable ground. Some of the corps of the Peninsula army moved with becoming activity, but the delaje of others were neith er creditable nor excusable. Had the army of the Potomac arrived a few days earlier the rebel army could have been easily delcated, and cer bars destroyed. lha retort further says the long inactivity of McClellan alter Antiatam, in the face of a defeated foe, during the most lavorablo season for rapid marches and a vigorous cam' paign. was a matter of great disappointment ana regtet.

In looking back over the events of the session, there is a feeling of satisfaction evinced by a'l, that so much has ton accomplished. It has been a working session on the whole, and perhaps the usual complimentary resolutions were never mere ically deserved than by the officers of the Legh teture rho have just reeeired them.

WilPetoa, Dec. 2, 1S52. w21w3 Fcl!owilhens of the Senate and House of Jie prcsentatices : Since your last annual assembling, another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed.. And while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way, all will be well. Foreign Amiss. The correspondence touching foreign af- lairs. which has taken place during last year is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to' tiat effect made by the House ol Representatives near the close of the last session ol Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less cratifvins than it has usuallv been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation to unhappily dis tracted as we are m ght reasonably have ap- prcuenoca. In the month ol June last there were some grounds to exict that the maritime powers, which nt thft lwcinnin rtf rnv Anmfstin ilifii. cultics so unwisely an3 unnecessarily, as wo mint:, recognixea tne insurgents as a belli' gerent, would soon recede lrom that position which has proved only less injurious to them selves than to our own country ; but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the national arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have Iiitnerto delayed that act ot simple justic The civil war which has so radically cnangea lor tne moment the occupation and habits oi the .American people, has necessa rily disturbed the social condition, and af- lccted vtry deeply the prosperity, ol the na nous viui vtuicu ne nave carneu on a com' merce that has been steadily inc throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time excited political ambi tions and apprehensions which have pro duced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne taking part in any controversy between lor' eign States and between parties or faction in such States. Wo have attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no rcvolu tion, but have Iclt to every nation the cxclu sive conduct and management of its own af fairs. Our struggle has been, ol course, contemplated by foreign nations with refer ence less to its own merits than its supposed and often exaggerated effects, and the conse quences resulting to those nations them selves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of tine government, even n it were just, would certainly be unwise. I he treaty with ureat ilntain ijr tin sup pression ot the Alrican slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion ut es pecial pleasure to acknowledge that the exe cution of it on the part of Her Majesty's Government lias been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the United States and tne ngnts ot tnetr moral and l-jyai citt z;ns. The Convention with Hanover for the abo lition of the Stadt dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for that parpuse. A blockade ul three thousand miles ol sea coast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season cl great commercial ac tivity like tbe rrcsent. without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting uninten tional injuries upon loreign nations and their subjects. A civil war occurring in a country where loreigners reside, and carry, inir on trade under treaty stipulations, is ne t'3urily lruitful of cumolaiots oi the viola. tion of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce neutral reclamations between na tions which have a common interest in pre serving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, sj far as possible. heard and redressed omplamts which have been presented by friendly powers There is, however a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the govern ment is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which tbe United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military author ities of foreign State which the govern ments of Ih.ve States ars not at once pre pared to redress. I bive proposed to some of the foreign nations t103 interested mu tual conventions to examine al adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to r ranee, to Spain and to Prussia. Ir; each (siT? lt iS been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend an ap propriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian barque Admiral P. Tordenskiola, which vessel was in Mav, 1S81, prevented bv the commander of tbe blockading fo ce off Charleston from leaving that port with a cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had shortly before been granted to'an En glish vessel I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to tbe proper committees. The new commercial trea,y between the United States and tbeSuItan of Turkey has been carried into execution A commercial and consular treaty i.as been'negjtiated. subject to the Senate's con scut, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of Havti. A c-jnsiderable improvement ul the Na tional Commerce Is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain. Prance, Spain, Portugal, llusia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, the Netherlands, Italy Rome and the other European States, re main undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to he maintained with Turkey. Morocco. China and Japan. lurmg the las: year there has not only oeen no cnaDge oi our previous relations wi h tbe independent States of our own con tinent, but more friendly sentiments than have heretolore existed are believed to be en tertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and Chili. The Commission under the Convention with the Kepublic of New Grenada closed its session withou. having audited and passed up. n all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition is r-endinc to revive the Convention, that it may be able to do more complete jusfec. lhe Commission between the united States and.tle Kepublic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. COI.OXIZJ.TI0X. Applications have been made to me hv many free Americans of African descent to favor their emigration with a view to such colonization as was contemplated, in recent acts of Congress. Other rarties at hnm and abroad, 6ome from interested motives, others upon p&triotio considerations, and still others ii.fluenced by philanthropic scnti- i lurm;, ume sugsestea similar mea::i" . ,' h.le on the other band. jctc '0Uh'e Spanish Amerif-" publics, bave protested j against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Lnder these circum stances I have declined to move any such colony to any State without first ob taining the consent of its Government, with an agreement on its part to receive and pro tect such emigrants in all their rights of freemen. And I hate at the same time offer ed to the several States situated in the tru p cs, or having colonies there, to ne 'Oti il with them, subject to the advice an'd consent ol the Senate, to favor the voluntary emi gration of t-ersons of that class to their res pective teintories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humabe Iia --re as J" the only coun- tues to which colonists ol African descent from here could go with the certainty of be mg received and adopted as citizens, and I regret to say that such persons contemplat ing coioniziuon do not .stem so willinc to emigrate to these countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their interes; demands. I believe, however, the opinion among them in this respect is improving.and that ere long there will be an augmentedand considerable emigration to both those coun tries from the United States. THE TEEBITOEIES. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained un disturbed by the civil war, 'arid they arc ex- iiivmu eucu eviueucs oi pros pen ly as jus tifies expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to bo organized as States, and be constitutionally admitted in the FeJ. Union. Tbe immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rap idly as peible Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the reve nues of the Government and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy ot your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to pro mote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to bc effective is a scientific exploration ot the mineral regions in those territories with a view;) he publication ol its results at home and inf eign countries results which can not fail to be auspicious. TUE XJIIONAL HXANCEJ. The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast exf-enditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression oi lite rebellion nave Hitherto been met wits promptitude and certainty unusual in simi iar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and tbe increased disburse ments made necessary by the augmented forces now in the held demand your best re flection as to the best modes of providingthe neccs siry revenue without injury to business, and with the least possible burden upon la bor. The suspensi.n of specie payments by tbe banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States Notes unavoidable. In no other way could tbe payment ol the troops and tbe sat isfactionot other just demands be so econom ically or as well provided tor. The judicious legislation of Congress securing tbe receiva bility of those noU-e for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them universal cur rency, and has satisfied partially, at least and for tbe time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense eums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earnest period compatible with due re gard to all interests, should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always lujurious, and to reduce these Uuctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose m wise legisla tion. Prompt and certain convertibility into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against these fluctuations, and it is extremely doubt- lul whether a circu'ation ol United States notes, payable in coin, and sufBeiently large lor the wants ot the people, can be rerma nently, usefully and safely maintained. I there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and tbe great advantages of a safe and unilorm currency secured ? I know of none which promises so certain results, and at the same time so unobjectionable, as the organization of banking a&wciitions under a general act ol Congress, well guarded in its provisions. to such associations the boy ernment might furnish circulating noti- on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury, these notes, preiared uii- dcr tbe supervision of tbe proper officers, be ing unnorm in appearance ana security, and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a v:ci us currency and lacilitate commerce by cheap and sale exchange. A moderate reservation from tbe interest on the bonds would com pensate the United states for the prei-aration and distribution ol the notes and a exnerui superv.sion of the sy-tero, and would lighten the burden of that att of the public debt employed as securities. lbs public credit, moreover, would be gret.tly improved, and tbe negotiation of the new loans greatlv facilitated by the steady market demand fur Government bonds, which the adoption of the proposed system would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as tar as possible, all existing interests by the op portunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various cireuhtloaf, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. lhe receipts into the treasury lrom all sources, including loans abd balance lrom the preceding year, lor the hscal year, ending on the 30:h ot June,lSC2,wereS5?3,SS5,247.00 Ot which sum $49,050,397 02 were derived from u.riims : Sl,i95,331 ,3 from the di rect tax ; from public lands Slo2.2y2 73 - from iiiisctUaneous sources, Ay31,77 04 from loans In all forms, $529,092,430 50.

The exj-enditures show a still more 'avor able result. Tne amount expended in 1S61 was $13,C00,759 11 ; for the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,304 13, showing a decrease of about $2,431,000 in the expenditures as compared wit11 the pre ceding year, and ut about $3,750,000 as compated with the fiscal year of li?00. The di fieiency in the department for the previous yar was $4,551,900 9S, lor the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814 57. These favorable results are in part ow ing to tbe cessation of mail service in 'be in surrectionary States and in part to a nrelul review of all the expenditures in that de partment in tbe interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also much improved. The Postmaster General also opened a correspondence through the depai tment of State with foreign Gov ernments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplify ing the rates of foreign postage and to expe- i dite the foreign mails. This tropos:tion, equally important to our adopted citizens and to tbe commercial inter est ol this country, has been favorably enter tained and agreed to by all the governments I from whom replies have been received I ask the attention of Congress to tbe sug gestion of the Postmaster General in his re port respecting the further legislation re quired, in bis opinion, for the benefit of the postal service. rrmic laxds. The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands ; The public lands have ceased to be a source ol revenue. From .he 1st of July, lSOJ, to the 30th of Siptember, 1SC2, the entire cash re ceipts from the sale of lands were 137,470,20. a sum much less) than the expense of our land system during the same ptricd. The home stead law, which will take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to sottlers, that silei for ca-ih cannot ba ex pected to an extent sufficient to meet the ex penses of the General Lind Office, and the cost of surveying and b inging the lanl into market. The discrcpancybetw c i the sum here stated as arising from the i -lc? of the public lands and the same derived lrom the same source as reported from the troasurydepartment arises, as i understand, lrom tlm tact mat me pe riods ol time, thou h apparently were not really coincident at the beginning points. The Treasury report includes a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior sufficiently largo .o greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now tcported up-m by the Interior and not by the 'f reasuiy. ixdiax arrams. The Indian tribe upon our frontiers bave, during tbe past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity The tribes occur.yins th Indian country South ol Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The Chief of tbe Cherokces has visited this city for the j urpese of restoring the former relations ot the tribe with tbe United States. He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United states neglected to furnish tho protection which their treaty stipulations required. In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked tbe settlements in their vicinity with extrcmo ferocity, killing indis criminately men, women and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided. It is estimated that no less than S00 persons were killed by the Indians and a large amount ot rroperty was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, aud suspicions which may be unjust ueeu noi 10 uu stateu. luiormation was re ceived by the Indian bureau from different sources about the time the hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the vtbite settlements by a.l the tribe's between the Mississippi river and the Rocky Mountains. The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from ihis Indian war. A largo portion ul her t. rritury has been depopulated and a severe I -s has been sustained by the destruction of property, iiie people ot that state manliest much anxiety lor the removal ot tbe tribes beyond tbe limits ot the state, as a guaran tee against future hostilities.

COMPENSATED MANCIPATION. On the 221 day of Septemb-r last a pro clamation was issued by the Exscut-ve, a copy of which is herewith submitted.

This is the only substantial dis- pute. lhe fugitive slave clause of the Con- i stitution and the law for the suppression o: the African slave trade are each as well en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in 1 community where tho moral sense of the , people imperfectly support the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This I think cannot be perfectly cureJ, and it would be worse in both cases, after the separation of the sec tions tbau before. The loieign sUvo trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fu gitive slaves, now only (artily surrendered, would not be surrendered a: ail by the others. Physically speaking n cannot separate. We cannot removo our respective sections SEPARATION' lUPOSeiLLE. There is no line, straight or crooked, suit able for a national boundaav upon which to divide. Trace through from Eist t Wet upon tho line between the free and slave country and w shall find that a little more tli.it one tbird ot its length are rivers easy be crossed and populated, or soon to be pop ulated, thickly upon both sides, while near; all its remaining length are merely survey ors lines, over which people may walk back and lorth without any consciousness ol thei presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the pirt oi the seceding ticn of tbe fugitivs slave clau-e. along with all other c nstit tion.il obligations upon the section seceded from. wiiil I should expect no treaty stipula tion would cvvr be made to take its place. ISut there is another ditbculty ; the ereat interior region, bounded cast by the Alle iihanies. north by the British demimons west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along wbicn the culture ol corn ana cotton meets, and which includes turt Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, UIno, Indiana, JliChigan, msconsin, ill nois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota and tbe territories of Dacotali, ebrasxa and part of Colorado, has above ten millions of peoplo and will have fifty millions with fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It contains more than one third of the country owned by the United states certainly more than one million square miles ; one half as populous as Mas sachusctts already is, it would have more than seventy five millions of peopli. A glance at the map shows that, territo rially speaking, it is the great body of the T) ..ill. fpi I . ihcpuuiiu. lue uiiiri uiia me uuiiuargiU' al borders to it. The magnificent region sloping west from tne Koclcy -Mountains tc the Pacific, bem, the deepest and the richest in undeveloped resources in toe production ot provisions grains, gras'va, and all which proceed from them. Thi- great interior region is naturally one ot the mo-t important in tbe world. Asve; tain from the statistics the small proportion ol the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also tbe large and ra idly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented, and yet this re gion has no sea coast, touches no ocean anywhero. As part ol i ne nation, its people now find and may forever find their way to Europe by .ew lorlt, to South America and Alrica by rew Urieans, and to Asia by aan rrancisco Rut separate our common country into two nations, as designed by tne present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not pfrhajs by a physical bar rier, but by embarrassing and onerous trad- regulations : and this is true wherever a d riding or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country.or place it south of Kentucky, -,r north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any part or place north of it, and none north t it can trade to any place south of it, except on terms dictated by a government foreign to them. T..cse cutlets, east, west and south, are indbpen sible to tbe well being of the people inhab iting and to inha'Mt this vit interior re-'ion i hich ol the three may be best is no proper riuestion ; all are xt:er than either, aud all of right b- long to that peop'.e and to their suee.Rsors Urever. trj- t tiiemse.vea, tbey veill n t ask where a In- of separation sha be. bat will vow rat! -r that there sh!l be no such line. .not are tne marginal regions less interested in tbs? communicatims to and through them to the great outside world. lbey too and each ot them mast nave ac cess to this fcgypt ot tbe t est without pay. ing toll at the crossing of any national boun dary. Uur national strile springs not lrom our permanent part, not from tbe land we inhabit, not lrom our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptituJes it demands Union and abhors separation ; in fact it would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Our strile pertains to eur- s;lves. to the passing generations ol men and it cannot without convulsion ba bushel forever with the passing of one generation. AlilNbVENT or TUE 

CONSTITUTION. In this view I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amenda tory to the Constitution of the United States: "llcsolted. By the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following Utri cles be proposed to the Legislatures or Con ventions of the several States, as amenlmenU to the Constitution of tbe Lmted States, all or any of which article, when ratified by three-fourths of said Uegi-1 itures or Conven tions, to be valid as part or parts of the said Lonstitutuo, viz Arfirle . Kvery .-'hP- wherein slavery now exist", which shnli ahili-h the same therein at any iiui- leure the first day of January in the year ji our Lrird, one tbou' sand nine hundred, shall receive compensa tion from the United spates as follows, to wit The President of the United Slates shall de liver to every such State I onds of the United States, bearing iuterest, at the rate of for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth cersus uf the United states said bonds to be delivered to such State by installments ur in one parcel at the comple tion ot the abolishment, accordingly as lhe same shall have !en gradual or at one time within such State, and interest shall begin to run ujion any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aloresaid and afierward. Ary State h iving received bonds as afure-n J ami a:terward introducing or tol erating slavery therein shall refund t- the United States the bonds so received or the value there-d. and all interest paid thereon. 'Ai-icte All slaves who 6ba!I have en joyed actual freedom by the chances ol the war at any time before tbe end of the rebel lion, shall be forever fre. but all onueis ol such who shall not huvs been dMoyal. shall be cotapeosaul fur tnem at the same rates as is provided for States adopting abolish ment of slavery, but in such a vyav t"iat no slave shall be twice accounted for.

Without slavery the rebe U ould never have existed, with out slavery it Could not continue. Amon" the Iriends uf the Union there is great di verity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slaveiy and the African race among us Some wculd abolish it suddenly and withou; compensation. Some would abolish it gradu ally and with compensation, some would re move the treed people from us and some would retain them with u, and there are yet other minor diversities. Becauseof these diversities we waste much strength in strug gles among ourselves. By mutual conces sions we should harmonize and nrt iaiK- ti:. i i L . h ' iu noma i) living slaves ; but it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution, which must largely attend immediate eman cipation in localities where their numbers are yery great, and it gives tbo inspiriting assurance that their posterity shall be free Torever. The plan leaves to each St ite choosing to act under it to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time, or by degrees extending over tte whole or any part ot the period, and it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, must fur ther mitigate the dissttisfaction of thoso who favor perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive compensation. Doubtless some of those who arc to pay and not to icceive will object ; yet. that the measure is both just and economic il is cer tain. The liberation of the slaves is tho destruc tion of property property acquired by des cent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for haying been olten said that the people of the South are no more responsible for the original introduc tion of this property than are the people of .1. - -v' . l I. " : . . . i . . , iuc .oriu, auu ueu ib is rememuereu lion unhesitatingly we use, all of us use cotton and tugar, and share tbe profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the south bas been more responsible than the -Nortu lor ltscun'.iuuance. If, then, for a common object this proper ty is to be sacrificed, is it not just that il be done at a common charge .' and il with less money, or money more easily paid, we can piescrve the benefits of tbe Union by this means than we can uy t e war alone, is not also economical t- do it? Let us consider it, then ; let us ascertain the sum we bave extended in the war since compensated emancipation was pro posed Ml -Uarca , and consider whether, it that measures baa been promptly ac cepted by even some ot the slave States, tbe same sum would not to have done more to close the war than bas been otherwise done, it so. the meas ure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure; certainly it is not so easy to pay somethm, as it is to pay nothing. But it is easier to pay a large eum than it is to pay a Ur-c: one, and it is easier to pay any sum when we rre able, than it is to pay it betore we ar o able The war requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be larger, but it would r.quire really no cash nor bonds men any faster than emaneibution progresses. Thi- might not and probably would nut close betore tae end ot the tairtv seven yean. At that time we shall probably have one' hun dred m:llions of peopic to share the burden instead of thirty one millions as now ; and not only so, but the increase of our popula tion may be expected to continue tor a Ion; time alter that period, as rapidly as before because our territory wil! not have become tun. i dj not state this inconsiderately.

Were our territories as limited as are the British lales.very certainly our population could njt expand as stated. instead ot receiving the loreign born as now, we should be c.-uipelled to send part of the native room away, out su -n is not our con dition.

This thows ao average decennial increase of 31.60 psr cent, in population through the seventy years from oar first to our last census taken.

If there ever could be a proper time for mere argument, h time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should ntter noth Ing for which they would not willingly be res ponsible through time and eternity. Is it tine. whites of the whole country and there would be 1 at one colored to seven whites. Coald the one la any way greatly dlstuib the seven ? There are many communities now haling more than one free colored person to seven whites, and thia without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. The District of Colombia and tho States of iiary- land and Delwire, are all In this' condition. Tho District has more than one free colored to six wnues. ana yet ia its frequent petitions to Con gress I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons aa one ef iu grievacces. Eut.why should emancipation South send the freed people North I People of any color seldom ran mless there be something to ran from. Hereto fore, colored people to some extent have fled North from bondage, aud now, perhaps, from both bond ace and destitution, but if rmuliiii n,3ni.ir,.trAn and deportation be adopted they will have neither to See from. Their old masters will giie them iifc ucui new laporers can be procured, and the freed men iu tarn will gladly give their labor hr the wages till new homes can te found lor teem in congenial climes and with people of Ik.-. ... kl.l 1 1 - - uiuiu uiu race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved, and in sny event cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them again? As practice proses more than theory, in any ease has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery la thia district last spring T Tt hat I have said of th- proper!! -a of free colored persons to toe wnites in trio Dinci is from the census of 1SC0, having no refeience to persons called con trabands, nor to ti , e made free by tho act of vu6.. uuii?uiug slavery cere. The plan con sisting of these articles is reeommeded, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption, nor will tie war nor proceedings under the proclamation of Sept. 22, 1562, be stayed because of the recom mendation of this plan. Its timely adoption I doubt not, would Iring restoration, and thereby stay both. Aad, notwithstanding this plan, Ihe recommendation that Congress provilo by law for compensating anvState which may adopt emanci pation before this plan shall bale been acted npoa is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would only be an advance part ef the plan, and tho same argu ments apply to both. This plan is recommended as a means not In exeluiion of, bat additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the nation al authority throughout the Union. The subject is presectei exclusively in its economical aspect. The plaa would, I am confident, secure peace mere speedily than can be done by force alone, while it would cost less, considering the amounts end man ner of payment, and times of payment, and the amounts would bo easier paid thaa will be the ad ditional cost of the war if wo rely solely upon force. It Is most likely, very likely, that it would cost no blood at all. Tho plan is proposed as permanent Constitu tional law. It cannot beoome such without tbe concurrence ot, first, two-thirds of Congress, and afterward three-fourths of the States. The requi site three-fourths of tho States will necessarily include seven of tho slave States. Their concur rence, if obtained, will give as.uracro of their severally adopting emancipation at no distant day upon the new Constitutional terms. This as surance would end the struggle now, and save the Inion forever. I do not f. rget Ihe gravity which should characterise a paper addressed to tho Con gress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of tho nation; nor do I forget that some of yoa are my seniors, nor that many of you bavo more ex perience thaa I in the conduct ef public affilrs; yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility Jjeting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yoarselves ia any uadac earn eatneas I may seem to display.

The Times' Falmouth despatch states that two desettera from the rebels one a Texas captain, the other a clerk in the rebel quar termaster's deparfment givo a report as follows : The rebel force at Fredericksburg numbers from 75,000 to 100,000 men. and certainly docs not exceed the latter figure, and that though suffering for want of cloth ing and many kinds of supplies, they are hopeful of final success. For once, however, Gen. L.-e und Lu at o ciatcs are puzzled over tho movement ol our army which they do not aecn to fully com prehend, and have finally concluded tbe ad vance to be a feint, designed to amuse them until prepared to attack from another quar ter. Upon this theory they now believe our force in front of Fredericksburg in reality to be small, and that immense hosts are being embarked at Bella Plain and conveyc in transports up tbe James River. Acting upon this idea they have com menced erecting earthworks tor the protec tion of a garrison lorcc while the main body of their army has again commenced moving towards Richmond. It is stated on good authority that no less than 180,000 ot the soldiers whose names now fill the muster rolls, arc absent with -ir without leave Fortress Monroe.
