The stalwart men of the Northwest, when they turned out in person, not by- proxy . by hundreds of thousands to right the battles of the T'nion, and so to pre¬ serve and perpetuate the I'nity of the Mississippi Valley, did but fol¬ low the plainest and most obvi¬ ous intuitions as to the in¬ terests and necessities of a peotile.

An suit is, ihw. when the smoke of the conflict has drifltsi away, and the angry turbulence of eh i! war is subsid¬ ing, that we look to the great Northwest as the risiforer and conservator of the real p"ow of the nation.

The New York Evening At, in a long article upon the subject of railroad dis¬ asters, says : On our railroads the ends of the rails an laid in elanis. technically called "ehairs," which are b itted to the sleei- ers. The ends of the rails are joined, originally, as closely as is convenient, or indeed possible, by thai method, due al¬ lowance Icing made lor tlie expansion caused hv heat. But the result is, uh-ii the road has been used awhih, that the ends are further separated ; the tsmcussion of the heavy u hc. i .(gainst the end of a rail drives it back : and it is not uncommon to see the end- of the rails half an inch, three-auarters of an inch, aud sometimes even an inch apart. Now suppose, what j actually hapis us, that one ot tnese enils i- slightly raised alsive the level ; w hen a locomotive or car win-el runs at the rate of twenty or thirty miles per hour against this end, the wheel receives a blow as from a sharp pointed hammer, a blow of imaM use force, which comes against a piece of cast iron, a !rittle sulwtance, v. ry liable to break. Experienced rail¬ road managers have assured us that at least two-thirds of the accidents on our roads are ascrihable to this cause. Now it is jierfeetly easy tn save all thus risk or rather certainty of disaster, and that by a method which is universally practiced In Eurojie, which has been thoroughly tested, and which would ad¬ mit of a speed of fifty or staty inilos per hour, w ith more safety than we have now with half that speed. In Europe the ends of the rails are lirmly united by w hat is called a li-h-Joini , this makes the w hole length of the track a contiuu- oii- rail in-:ea.l of tlie innumerable -cpa- rate pieces which cause oil our rwatts a ism-taut jolting and jarring to the cars, and have the further and iHsastroUsettect we have liescribed. The joint aru sol¬ idly made and bolted ; tin-rail is, as we Daresaid, continuous : there is no jnr, no blow against the wheels, no strain or concussion, such as gradually sjircadsand flattens the ends of the half-worn rails with us; and tlie result is security against the chief cause of accidents ou our roads. ls!parted till lir,-. on tbe W.I1 of Jfevsmber, lii, la the anil rear of hr me-.
