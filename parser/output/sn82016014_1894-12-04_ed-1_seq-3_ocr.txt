"In addition t these causes of anxiety the vast accumulation of nmuy a", our financial centers and the general de pression in business which prevailed in this country had so reduced the rates of discount that the inducement to keep funds abroad where better investments could be made were much jf re -iter than in ordinary times, and this, tcj-ether with other facts stated, made it highly impru dent to neglect any precaution which ap peared necessary to insure the safety of our linancial position.
