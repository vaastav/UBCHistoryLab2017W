WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. StepB to obtain a personal interview with President Wilson before framing a senate policy in the strained rela tions with Mexico were decided on today by the foreign relations com mittee. The decision was made after Sec retary Lansing had appeared before the committee and, it was said by members, had discloaed that because of the president's illness, he had not been consulted by the state depart ment in its handling of the recent developments which have brought relations between the two (govern ments to a serious stage. At the White House tonight, the president's physician. Dr. Grayson, said he saw no reason why the com mittee's representatives, if they ur gently desired it, could not see the president tomorrow. It was indicat ed that the two members selected. Senators Fall. Republican. New Mex ico, and Hitchcock, Democrat, of Ne braska, would endeavor to do so. In deciding .to take its problem di rect to the president, the committee divided along party lines, six Repub licans voting for the proposal and five Democrats opposing it. The ac tion came at the end of a day of dis cussion of Senator Fall's resolution, which would ask the president to withdraw diplomatic recognition of the Carranza government. .It was said by Republican mem-, bcrs that although the committee did not discuss In detail the extent to which the president's illness might Cummins Concludes Three-Day Talk On His Railroad Bill 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. After speaking three days, Senator Cum mins, chairman of the interstate commerce committee, concluded late today a detailed explanation of his railroad bill, designed to meet condi tions wit hthe return of the roads to private ownership and control. Discussing the anti-strike provision of the measure, as proposed by the committee, Senator Cummins de clared "there had been an industrious effort to misrepresent the bill. He denied that it interfered in any way with railway employes or officials who desired to quit work. Emphasizing that he was not op posed to labor organizations. Senator Cummins said the committee, insert ing the anti-strike section, felt that "the civilization of America cannot continue or endure unless organized society can find some plan to pre serve industrial peace and order." President Wilson's message to congress Tuesday, he declared, was a direct endorsement of the proposed legislation. 

AMBASSADOR B0NILLAS DENIES HE OR MEXICAN CONSULS IN U.S. SPREAD RED PROPAGANDA WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Denial of charges by Senator Fall that he had at tempted to spread Bolshevist propaganda in this country was made tonight by Mexican Ambassador Bonlllas, who declared that he "had not at any time done anything to foster, encourage or aid, actively or passively, directly or indi rectly, any of the disturbing elements referred to, either in the United States or Mexico." Ambassador Bonillas said his government not only did not wish to foment disorder in the United States or spread radical doctrine, but had taken energetic steps to prevent its spread in Mexico. The ambassador's statement follows: , "I have been informed, through the press, of the accusation made by Senator Fall before the United States senate to the effect that this embassy and some consulates, with the knowledge and approval of the president of Mexico, have endeavored to stir seditious acts in this country and have been engaged in anarchistic or Bolshevik! or I. W. W. propaganda. "Senator Fall's charges greatly surprised me, for the hurtfulness of them must be obvious to all. Fortunately, I have great reliance in the sound judgment and high sense of honor of the American senate and of the Ameri can people, and therefore I cannot believe that these false- and Injurious accusations will be seriously considered for one moemnt "I hav been the ambassador of Mexico and residing In Washington as such for two years and eight months, and I have not, during that time or at any other time, done anything to foster, encourage or aid, actively or pas sively, directly or indirectly, any of the disturbing elements referred to either in the United States or Mexico. By disturbing elements, I refer to the Bov cheviki, anarchists, and the I. W. W., and I have no knowledge of this being done by any of our consular or other agents of the Mexican government." 

DECIDES n TD FOLLOW IT I have interfered with the discharge - of his duties, the point was brought j out that should the Mexican, situation continue to become more critical some question as to the executive's physical capability might result. j In opposing the request for an in terview the Democrats are iu.ler stood to have based their' arguments on a statement to the committee by Secretary Lansing, who was said to have declared that the administration was carrying out a well defined pol icy of dealing vigorously with Mexico and to have questioned the wisdom of any precipitate action at this time. The decision to take a more decisive attitude against invasion of American rights in the southern republic, Mr. Lansing was quoted as saying, was reached some months ago and now it was about to develop, whether the Carranza regime would accept or dis regard It. He was said to have added that the administration was prepared to go to whatver length necessarj to enforce that policy. Neither the secretary nor the ad ministration senators, however, were reported as expressing directly any opposition to the " Fall resolution. Several attempts to postpone action on it came from the Democratic side, and Senator Hitchcock, acting Dem-. ocratic leader of the senate, suggest ed a substitute by which the senate merely would endorse the Plate de partment's course In the matter and declare In advance Its support of the president Bhould he decide to break off diplomatic relations.

Two par ties of federal troops were reported tonight in Agua Prieta to be in pur suit of four masked bandits who this morning about 5 o'clock attempted to hold up the stage bound for El Tigre mine, with $15,000 in American gold and currency aboard. One of three mounted guards riding ahead of the stage, a private in the Mexican fed eral army, was killed and another, Capt. Pedro Garcia, was shot in the hand. The stage, with three other federal soldiers in it, -was a consider able distance in the rear, concealed from the view of the bandits by a turn in the road. The unwounded guard, fighting from behind his horse, held the 'four, masked men at bay while Captain Garcia rode Dack to get assistance.

Parties had been started out from Agua Prieta to intercept the men should they make an effort to cross the border.

Only a few votes separated the two Republican favorites, the California senator being slightly in the lead: Democrats are apparently . not as interested as the Republicans, judging from the small number of votes cast for potential presidential candidates of that party. Of the few votes cast by Democrats in this district William McAdoo and President Wilson received the majority, the present chief tx ecutive being a alight favorite.' The lack of interest In the vote displayed by the local Democrats i explained by one member of the party as being due to the uncertainty ct who will be the national selection should President Wilson refuse to run again. It is mainly for this reason the uncertainty as to who will be the most popular candidate that the Review inaugurated the straw vote.
