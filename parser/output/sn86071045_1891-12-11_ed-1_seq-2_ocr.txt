Gouoher Esq. alone, as the other two delegates for this county did not pnt in an appearanoe. Mr. Sword of Lawrenoe Co. presided; a motion to adopt the popular vote system was tabled, the proportionate delegate system was discussed, bat no conclusion was arrived at, and the convention ad" jon rued to meet on Wednesday, Jan. Gtb, at 1.30 P. M. at the Fountain House in New Castle. One ofthe delegates of Mercer Co.,andonc 1 from Beaver Co., expressed themselves in favor ofthe .popular vote system, but the other four delegates of those counties, and all of those of Lawrenoe Co. wore solidly against it, though none of them preseuted any well matured substitute for it. And there is no substitute for the popular vote, eithor for nominations or elections. It is cheaper both in time and money; it does away- with the go-betweens commonly called politicians, it makes tho candidate the direct creature of the popular will, and it is the only fair method of making all nominations within the lines of any State in the Union.

Every now and thin we hear j of responsible and respected citizens of , thi3 county, well up in years whose name* , have never been in tho Jury wheel; wiiilu on tho other hand there ate a lot of loafers , all over the county who 3u'.is a business , of getting their naaiw in tin wheel aa , often as the law allows. , The Electoral Vote.

A law was enacted in that State requiring Presidential Electors to be chosen by Congressional districts, except the Senatorial Blootors The law was test ed in the Suprome Court of the State and its constitutionality affirmed. New Con gressional were formed. And no matter how that State hereafter goes for President the Electoral Delegation will probably be divided.

MEETING OF CONGRESS. Congress met Monday noon, but the preliminary contest for the Speakership "i the House began on the previous Saturday at 2 p.m. when tho Democratic member to the number of 227 met in tho Hail ofthe House and, with Air. Holuiun presiding proceeded to ballot for the party nomin.» tion which, in this case, was equivalent to election. Messrs Crisp of Georgia, Mills of Texas Springer of Illinois, McMillen of Tennes see and Hatch of Missouri were placed ir nomination, and the first ballot resulted as follows: Crisp 84, Mills <B, Springer 32, McMilliac 18, natch 14, Stephens 1, total 227, necessary to nominate 114 They continued to ballot till long aft . supper tin#, the 17th and last ballot stand ing Crisp 94, Mills 91, McMillen 19, Splin ter 17, Hatch 5, and Stephens 1 and then atQUwmed till 10 o'clock of Monday mo:"' - ing. —- At 10 o'clock of Monday niorniu? the Democratic members aga:nmet in the He.: ofthe House, with 212 members present and proceeded to ballot for the nouiir.atio. for Speaker, and kept it up till noon * ith Tery little change in the result. At noon the doors were opened and th Republicans ontered, the old Clerk call?-' the roll and announced 326 members as be ing present, and then on motion of Mr Holmau, the House adjourned till noon o next day; the Republicans left, and th hostile Democratic factions got to work again. Ballot aftor ballot wa? taken and no change was made of any importance nnti: toward 9 p.m. when Mr. McMillen with drew. His followers divided their vote between Crisp and Mills, he himself votinp for Mills. As the 30th and last ballot was being taken Mr. Springer withdrew and voted tor Crisp. Some of his followers also vot ed for Crisp, bringing that gentleman vote up to 119 and electing him. Mil's vote was 105. Crisp isoneof the members from Georgis and he is not as radical a freetrader as i.- Mills of Texas, who delights in styling himself "a freetrader from Freetrader ville." The caucus then selected James Kerr o Pennsylvania for Clerk; C. 11. Turner o New York for doorkeeper; S. S. Oder o Ohio for Sergeanl-at-Arm*; L G. Dalti of Indiana for Postmaster, and Dr. Mil burn for Chaplain. The Senate also met at noon with the Vice President in the chair. There were seventeen now Senators to be sworn in, and they were called no ii groups. When the credent ills of Mr Price of Ohio were read. Sena! or Sherm . said; "Before the oath of office is adminis tered to Mr. Brice I desire to say that . large portion of the citizens of Ohio conter.'j than ho was not an inhabitant of that statf at the time of hii election, and was the:c fore not eligible to a seal in that hotly. O? examining the proced3nt.-, of vrlo'ch there ara several in the history of this gover" rcent, and sorco of them most important, J am perfectly satisfied that Mr. Biice is en titled to be sworn in on the prima facie case of his credentials, which are regular ir form. I simply give this notice, however so his being sworn may not bo considers any waver or any misapprehontion or mis construction, if the people or legislature o Ohio should assert and prove to the satis faction of the Senate that Mr. Brice w« not at the time ofhiselection sn inhabit;, of Ohio. I think that this statement iV. me is proper and necessary. But I make m objection to the swearing in of Mr. Brice. " A Committee was appoints;! to act wi: that of the House in notifying the Presiden of Congress being rea l.',' for business, am the Senate adjourned till the next. day. On Tuesday the organisation of t'. House was completed. It mot at nooa Messrs Crisp, Iteed and WaUon wen placed in nomination for Speaker and Crisp received 228 votes, Reed 83 and Wet son 8; Crisp was declared elected and wa.- escorted to the chair by Messrs. Mills am Reed. The other officers earned by th- Democratic caucus were also elected. Mr. Mills took a seat in the back pari o the House and is aaotjsed of sulking. He refused a place on th« Oouimlttcn to waL npon the President. The Hou->e indulgen in the usual lottery for seats and then ad journed. The Senate met and considered the cas of Call of Florida, and Dubois of Idaho, and seated them as Senators, and waitci for the President's Message nnlil apprise of the fact that it would not be forthcom ing till next day, whet; it adjourned. Congress met Wednesday noon and th only business of importance transacted ii either branch wa.» the reading of the Piv ident's Message. The House Committee have not yet been appointed. TUB

John Dougherty, an oil well driller re siding in Green county, died last week from puenmonia. Mr. Dougherty was a Democrat and made a bet with a Re publican that Campbell would defeat Mc- Kinlev for Governor of Ohio. The loser was to olimb to the top of an oil derrick, feet high, aud remain there from G a.m. to OP.M mounted the derrick Saturday morning, the 21st ult , and, al though the rain poured down all day, be did not flinch. When he came down at r.ight he was cramped and weak. On the following day violent pueumonia, brought j on by tiie exposure, set in and his death I resulted. A terrible accident happened at Latrobe last Monday, by which Harry and Edith, children of Marshal Wianer, will in all probability lose th«ir lives. They were playing in the kitchen when one of the legs of the stove was knocked out and the stova fell over. Two kettles of boiling water fell npon tho children, aud they were so severe ly scalded that fears are entertained that I they cannot recover. The boy especially is suffering awful agony. Harry Banninster, ofDnqnsne.Alleghany county, was shot a-IJ killed by James X. Taylor last Thursday night. It appears that Baumaster, who lives fully a mile out of town, had gone toDnqnesne Wednesday evening to attend * labor meeting, and get S ome medicine for his sick baby. Encount ering two friends, Joseph Liukdaur and John Atkinson he visited soveral saloons. The trio b»gai drinking and kept it up un til midnight, when the saloon closed. Kink hanr, who is a carpenter, last night told what happened after that. When we came 1 out of the saloon," said he, "Baumaster said: Let's go down down here to Mrs. Taylor's and have some fun. I've been there often when her old man is away, and it'll be all right. This i< Taylor's week for night work and everything will be all right." We wont with him, and wiien we got near the holies Baumaster told us to wait until he would go up and wake Mrs. Taylor. Qj got np on the fence and rapped on the window The first this we knew there was a shot fired, then we heard a groan aud poor Harry fell to the ground. We ran off, while the man with the gun kept shooting away. We did not shoot at hitn, for none of us had guns. WA didn't know Mrs. Taylor, but when Harry told us that he was in the habit of going there, and there would be .s LINE other woman there, we thought it was all right This ooenred SOME weeks but it hasn't lost its flavor. P. M. McClintock, lawyer, of Union City, WAS ia Erie and dined at the Reed House. Soon after ho had registered for dinner, C. S. Olmstead of Corry, and J. W Sproul, of Union City, came in. Seeing MCC'a NAME, they winked slyly at the clerk, and registered affixing to their autographs the words "with Mc- Clintock," so that tho bill of the party would be the later. McClintock when coming to the counter, saw through the joke. Ho paid the bill without protest. Theulie went forthwith to th« office of the Poor Directors, where hefiled an application in regular form, setting forth that C. S. Oimstcad find J. W. Sproul are destitute and without visiblo means of sqpyort, "and I being a relative of said parties,i.e., a brother (in law), do most respectfully pray that an order of relief bo at once Issu ed by your honorable Board of Poor Direct ors.
